1oi7tri,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1oi7tri/tips_for_smokers_who_want_to_quit/,Tips for smokers who want to Quit,"Before you downvote, I'm putting this up as I got a lot of DMs on a comment I put up yesterday where I mentioned I went from smoking 8-10 cigs a day to hardly 1 or 2 a month, that too socially. So I thought a post might reach some people who actually need this.

I'm a guy who started smoking when I was barely 19 (21 rn). Being a musician in a band with my friends, it made sense to smoke a lot as that has been a culture for all rock/metal bands. But I did realise that this is compromising with my health too much. I decided I want to quit. I have been smoking negligibly since February 2025 and here is what I did.

First of all, I just stopped completely. Threw out all the cig boxes, lighters and ash trays. Needed some guts there. The next couple of days were the most difficult. I had headaches, constipation, insomnia and a lot of mental instability (I got angry at every other thing). After those 2 days, the withdrawal symptoms reduced to just cravings and with a little bit of those anger issues. These stayed for 4-5 days. But after a week, I was totally done. No more cravings, no more smoke smelling from my walls.

Now coming to the part on battling the withdrawal symptoms. For headaches, I would suggest take a maximum of one painkiller if needed. I am a person who stays off caffeine, but if you consume tea or coffee, you can have a cup extra. This could help. Mind that you need to do this only for 2 or 3 days. The cravings can be controlled by distraction. For me, I just picked up my skipping rope and did 500 skips every time I had a craving. Instead of ruining my lungs by satisfying the craving, I tried to better them my doing some cardio.

One extra tip for this week is to never keep yourself hungry. I had tried to quit earlier as well and most of the times when I feel hungry, I feel like smoking. So don't keep yourself hungry, have some food asap. This didn't harm me much as J work out regularly so I didn't gain fat much, plus the bonus cardio from skipping. You can also do the same.

For all those who do not smoke, please stay away from nicotine. I have tried alcohol, nicotine and weed and by far, nicotine is the most addictive and most harmful. It has potential to ruin your health and eventually your life.

And for the smokers who are reading this and want to quit, trust me, it's just a week. That one week is gonna be difficult but after this week, you will feel reborn. Your body will start to heal, you will look better, your testosterone will increase (idk about women, sorry), if you work out then you'll see better gains and ig everyone knows this but you'll save yourself from a potentially very painful death from cancer. I'm here and if anyone feels they need more help, my DMs are open. All the best.",2,1761654013.0,TwentiesIndia,0,1.0,False

1oi7t1s,https://i.redd.it/e9oaw4kohuxf1.jpeg,MindSpace Collective: A new kind of coworking space on Curry Pike (Open House Nov 5!),"Hey r/Bloomington! 

I recently opened something new called MindSpace Collective, and I wanted to share what it‚Äôs all about ‚Äî because it‚Äôs a little different from your typical coworking space.

Most coworking spaces are open and full of glass walls. That‚Äôs great for designers and remote workers, but not so great if your work involves confidential or emotional conversations. 

As a mental health professional myself, I realized there wasn‚Äôt really a place for people like therapists, attorneys, or massage therapists who need privacy, comfort, and professionalism without committing to a full-time lease (especially in Bloomington where commercial leases are very expensive) 

That‚Äôs how MindSpace Collective was born.

It‚Äôs a coworking space made up of private, fully furnished offices, each designed like a therapist‚Äôs office ‚Äî cozy chair, couch, desk, and lamp ‚Äî plus a large conference room for groups, workshops, or team meetings.

You can rent a space for a day, a few days a week, or full-time ‚Äî whatever fits your schedule.

Features include:
	‚Ä¢	Private offices with 24/7 access available 
	‚Ä¢	Comfortable furnishings (chair, couch, desk, lamp)
	‚Ä¢	High-speed Wi-Fi
	‚Ä¢	Free coffee & tea
	‚Ä¢	Printing access included 
	‚Ä¢	Convenient private parking
	‚Ä¢	Large private conference room for workshops or groups

We've been living together for about a year and a half and it's been pretty good overall. We're not best friends but we get along fine, split bills evenly, respect each other's space.

About four months ago Jasmine started dating this girl named Violet. Things got serious fast and now Violet is here like 5-6 nights a week. She's practically living here but not paying rent or utilities. That's annoying but not really the main issue.

The problem is Violet has decided our apartment needs to be ""optimized.""

It started small. She rearranged the spices in our kitchen by color instead of alphabetically like I had them. Weird but whatever. Then she reorganized under the sink, moved all our cleaning supplies around, and installed these drawer organizers she bought without asking.

I came home one day and our entire living room furniture was rearranged. The couch was in a different spot, the TV was moved, our bookshelf was completely reorganized by size instead of how we had it. Violet was there and said she thought ""the energy flow was off"" and this was better for the space.

I told her I'd prefer if she asked before moving stuff around. She said ""oh I'm sorry, I just love organizing and decorating, it's kind of my thing."" Jasmine was like ""it does look better though doesn't it?""

Last week I couldn't find my favorite coffee mug. Searched everywhere. Turns out Violet had packed it away in a box in the cabinet because ""we had too many mugs out and it was cluttering the aesthetic."" MY mug. That I use every single day.

Yesterday I came home and she'd rearranged my bathroom counter. My makeup, skincare, hair stuff, all moved around and ""organized"" into these acrylic containers she bought. She labeled them and everything.

I lost it a little. Told her she needed to stop touching my stuff and rearranging our apartment without permission. She got really quiet and said she was just trying to help and make our space nicer. Said her love language is acts of service and she thought she was doing something nice for us.

Jasmine jumped in and said I was being harsh and that Violet was just trying to contribute since she's here so much. I said if she wants to contribute she can start paying rent, not messing with my bathroom.

Violet left crying. Jasmine said I was an asshole and embarrassed her in front of her girlfriend. Said Violet has ADHD and organizing things helps her feel calm and in control, and I basically just shamed her for her coping mechanism.

Now Jasmine is barely speaking to me and I feel bad because I didn't know about the ADHD thing and I don't want to be insensitive. But also this is MY apartment too and I'm tired of coming home to find everything moved around.

My friend group is divided. Some say I had every right to set boundaries especially since Violet isn't paying to live here. Others say I was too harsh and could've handled it more gently, and that if organizing helps Violet's ADHD I should be more accommodating.

My sister says I should sit down with both of them and establish clear rules about what Violet can and can't touch. But honestly I'm just exhausted and kind of don't want to have to manage this at all.

Quick context - we have 2 month old twins, I am upstairs with our twins and my husband is with the older two. I sometimes need him to run me something upstairs (bottles, coffee, etc). Two times this week (last one being this morning) my 3 yo has hit (and kept hitting over and over) her little brother, when he isn‚Äôt doing anything at that moment. The first time, 3 yo picked up a baby stroller and smacked him over and over and over the moment my husband ran upstairs. We have a ring so we can see it. He was sitting there, and she hit him unprovoked. Only stopped because the stroller collapsed. 

The second time was just now, he took her cup and she took it back and started hitting him. Both times she follows him around the room and literally does not stop for anything.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôm so tired. We are gentle parenting, and it works for the most part but I‚Äôm at a loss. She knows how to show gentle, she knows to ask for help, say no thank you, remove herself, etc.

1oi7q8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGadgetsAndGear/comments/1oi7q8m/how_i_got_my_lost_dog_back_the_easy_way/,How I got my lost dog back the easy way,"Every pet owner has that nightmare. One moment your dog is in the backyard, the next the gate is cracked open, and they‚Äôre gone. For me, that nightmare became real last month. My golden retriever, Max, has always been curious, but I never thought he‚Äôd take off like that. The search that followed was the longest two hours of my life, and the solution I found afterward is what I want to share, because it changed the way I think about keeping pets safe.

**The day Max disappeared**  
It was a Saturday morning. My kids were in the yard playing with Max, and I went inside to grab coffee. When I came back out, silence. The gate had been left just slightly open. Max was nowhere to be found.

Panic set in instantly. We piled into the car and drove up and down the neighborhood streets. We asked neighbors, we shouted his name. Nothing. Those two hours were filled with every awful thought possible: what if he got hit by a car, what if someone picked him up, what if he couldn‚Äôt find his way back?

Finally, a neighbor spotted him wandering a few blocks away. Relief doesn‚Äôt even describe it. But I knew right then that I never wanted to go through that again.

**Finding a solution**  
That night I went down the rabbit hole of pet safety. GPS collars, Bluetooth trackers, and even smart fences. The problem was, most solutions were either overpriced subscriptions or bulky devices my dog wouldn‚Äôt tolerate.

That‚Äôs when I came across the **itagpro gps tracker**. At first, I thought it was just for luggage or keys. But as I read more **itagpro reviews**, I noticed people talking about attaching it to their pets‚Äô collars. Lightweight, waterproof, long battery life. It seemed almost too simple.

**How does iTagPro work with pets?**  
Setup was easier than I expected. The tracker paired with my phone in minutes. The itagpro range is strong enough to cover my house, yard, and street. When Max is nearby, I can see his exact location via Bluetooth. If he wanders farther, the app switches to GPS and shows me his last known location on the map.

That was the feature that stood out: even if I wasn‚Äôt in direct range, I‚Äôd know where to start looking. For a runaway dog, that‚Äôs half the battle.

**The real test**  
Of course, the universe decided to test me. Two weeks later, Max got out again. This time I didn‚Äôt panic. I pulled out my phone, opened the app, and saw his dot about three blocks over near a park. Instead of driving around aimlessly, I walked straight to him.

He looked up like nothing had happened, wagging his tail, ready to keep exploring. In less than ten minutes, he was back home safe. That moment proved it to me: iTagPro isn‚Äôt just for people who misplace keys, it‚Äôs a real tool for families with pets.

**Is iTagPro legit?**  
That was my first concern before buying. After using it for a month, I‚Äôd say yes. It doesn‚Äôt replace keeping a close eye on your dog, but it‚Äôs an incredible backup. The tracker is small enough that Max doesn‚Äôt notice it on his collar. The battery lasts for months, so I‚Äôm not constantly recharging. And it works on both iOS and **itagpro for Android**, which made setup simple on my phone.

**Peace of mind matters**  
The truth is, no tracker can stop a pet from wandering, but having one means you‚Äôre not helpless when it happens. The easy way I got Max back the second time wasn‚Äôt luck, it was preparation. That‚Äôs the difference.

If you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs where I got mine: [**iTagPro GPS Tracker**](https://itagpro.pickguru.blog/)

**Final thought**  
Losing Max even for two hours felt like forever. Getting him back quickly the next time gave me a kind of relief that‚Äôs hard to put into words. For any pet owner who knows how it feels to fear the worst, the iTagPro tracker is worth considering. It turns the panic of ‚Äúwhere did they go?‚Äù into the reassurance of ‚ÄúI know exactly where to look.‚Äù",1,1761653735.0,TechGadgetsAndGear,0,1.0,False

I do school drop off for my kid at 7, then I am at the laptop by 7 40 with coffee and a very dented blue Nalgene. It works, my team is spread from Ohio to Lisbon, we live in Jira and Zoom, cameras on when it makes sense, async updates in Slack when it does not. New VP arrives, tall pep, big smile, says we need office energy again and announces anchor days. Two days in the office, no assigned desks, book a hot desk in an app that constantly forgets my name. I live 42 miles from the nearest office, there is no shuttle, no stipend, just the promise of pizza. I ask if they will cover gas or parking, HR smiles like a screensaver and says, that is a team player thing. My manager, who I like, says, try it for a couple weeks and we will see.

First anchor day, I leave at 6 to beat traffic, arrive at 7 15, fight with a ThinkPad T14 that refuses to handshake with the captive office wifi, Okta keeps spinning, Cisco AnyConnect wants a code I dont have because my phone is in a dead zone under concrete. I tether, security pings me, can you explain the unusual login, I wave at the guard who looks bored and says, you are fine. At 9 we have a client walkthrough, I am on a borrowed Logitech C920 because the hot desk has no webcam, my audio keeps crackling, my Zoom refuses to record because of some policy we never saw. I can feel my stress pulse in the back teeth, my kid texted me that I left my lunch at home, great. We demo anyway and it is ok, but not great, the client asks if our team is stable and I give a very careful answer that sounds like a press release. On the way home I realize I spent 70 minutes to get to a chair that is worse than my chair at home and 70 minutes to get back to a kitchen where my chair already is.

So I did a petty, nerdy thing. I ran a two week experiment. Week one remote, I set office hours, 8 to 2 focus, 2 to 4 meetings, after 4 quiet catchup, Slack on do not disturb blocks, calendar defense hard. I tracked tickets closed, cycle time, time to first response in support, code review turnaround for my squad, even the silly little metrics like backlog grooming minutes. Remote week we closed 37 points, median cycle time 2.1 days, first response to customers 12 minutes, three bugs escaped into production, two crashes caught by Sentry, zero missed standups. I hit 10 thousand steps walking while on calls because I pace the hallway like a weirdo, fine. Week two, I did the exact same but with anchor days, two days in, three days remote. In office week we closed 19 points, cycle time 3.8 days, first response 29 minutes, four bugs escaped, one hotfix derailed a morning because the VPN killed my Git pulls during the deploy window. I lost 9 hours to commute and desk hunting and a broken badge reader that sent me to a different floor where there were no HDMI cables. Money wise, gas and tolls 39 dollars, parking 18 dollars, two lunches because the pizza ran out by the time I found the room, 26 dollars, also a random cable from the vending machine, 14 dollars, my wallet quietly screamed.

I showed the data to my manager. They said, this is compelling, but numbers do not capture vibes. The VP said, the office is an investment in culture, you have to be present to be counted. I said, presence is not the same as output, and I am present in every channel that matters. I also said the quiet part, I do morning dialysis rides for my dad twice a week and the anchor day blows a hole in that plan, I can figure it out, but it is not simple. The VP said something about pajamas and discipline, it landed like a wet sock. That night, after I put the kid to bed, I polished the resume, two calls later I was in a process for a fully remote role, small pay cut, but a stipend of 125 a month for internet, 600 a year for workspace, and, the big one, a manager who said, I care about outcomes, not seat sensors. Last week at our all hands the VP announced a tighter RTO, three days, and used the word rebuild team spirit. I used the same meeting to hit send on my resignation. My manager pinged me, wow, dead serious, I am not mad, I wish you told me sooner, I said, I tried, I brought data. They said, fair.

I start the new job in two weeks. My old company offered a title bump with no change in pay and a promise to revisit in Q4, I said no, politely, then closed my laptop and looked at the ridiculous mountain of cables I bought to make their office work and laughed. If you took a pay cut to stay remote, was it worth it, what number made it fair for you, or did the time back beat every number anyway. I am not trying to dunk, I am very tired and also very relieved, and I want to hear what lever actually moved for you, money, title, commute, or just the ability to eat lunch that is not cold pizza on a cardboard box.

I guess I just need to let this out somewhere because it‚Äôs too heavy to keep inside. I (34F) was married to Leo (36M) for six years, together for ten. For most of that time, I honestly thought we were happy. We weren‚Äôt perfect, but it felt real. We used to take road trips every summer not fancy ones, just throw a bag in the car, windows down, music too loud kind of trips. He‚Äôd always make me stop at the weird roadside diners because he said that‚Äôs where the ‚Äúreal pancakes‚Äù were.

We spent one anniversary in Italy, eating gelato by the river and getting lost in side streets. He bought me a silver ring from a market there; it still sits on my dresser. Even small things felt special with him. Sunday mornings were my favorite ‚Äî he‚Äôd bring me coffee in bed and put on that old record player we found at a thrift shop. I used to think, if this isn‚Äôt happiness, what is?

Then one ordinary afternoon, it all ended.

I was paying bills on his laptop when a message popped up. Just a few words  ‚ÄúI miss you already.‚Äù My stomach dropped. I opened the chat, thinking it was a mistake, and found months of messages. Photos. Plans. Inside jokes. Love. And it wasn‚Äôt from a woman. It was from a man.

When I confronted him, he broke down. He told me he‚Äôs gay, that he‚Äôs always known, that he never wanted to hurt me. He said he married me because he loved me in his own way and thought he could make it work. Hearing that felt like someone slowly tearing pages out of my life.

The divorce was quick, quiet. No screaming matches or broken plates just signatures and silence. I moved into a small apartment with thin walls and bad lighting. He kept the house, our memories still painted on the walls.

Now I wake up and sometimes forget where I am. I still buy his coffee brand without thinking. I still reach for my phone to text him when something funny happens. Then I remember.

He‚Äôs happy now. I saw a photo of him with someone new ‚Äî smiling, free, alive in a way he never was with me. I want to be happy for him, and part of me is. But the other part feels like it‚Äôs fading out. Like I‚Äôm watching the world move on without me.

People keep saying, time heals, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true. It just feels like time is erasing me ‚Äî slowly, gently, like I was never really there.

I don‚Äôt hate him. I think, in another life, maybe we could‚Äôve met differently, without all the pretending. I just wish love hadn‚Äôt left me so empty.

It served me for 12 years, so i can't complaint. i am looking for maybe enter the manual setup. i wonder if the Classic Pro + Timemore 064S would be a good starting point. Actually i don't drink any milk beverage. Only ""Americanos!"".

What I am looking for:

\- A setup that i will not outgrow in the first year.

\- A project! I have been in  self made CNC, 3d printers, computers,  for years.

What i fear,

\- when i want a coffee, i do not want to wait 30 minutes for the machine to be ready and then have 10 minutes of prepping a single coffee.

\- I live alone but on weekends my GF is here and she drinks milk coffee. so prepping 2 coffees, one with milk should not take forever.

What do you think?

# What is a Sling Bag Anyway?¬†

So, a sling bag is basically a bag you sling over one shoulder, and it rests across your chest or back. Simple right but what makes it cool is how comfy and handy it is. You can move around, shop, travel, or just run errands and your hands are free. Unlike those heavy handbags or bulky backpacks, sling bags are light and easy. You can find them in all sorts of materials from leather to canvas and in all kinds of styles. Brands like [**Angeline by Angie**](https://angelinebyangie.com/) have seriously made sling bags into a fashion statement that still works for everyday life.¬†

# Are Sling Bags Comfortable¬†

Yes, yes yes, if you pick a good one. The trick is the strap and the design.

As a result, I am regressing into my ED. How can I keep the relationship and not ruin my health in the process?","Hello! I (27F) got into a relationship with 29M a few months ago. In the last couple of weeks, I have been spending almost all nights at his place. I love just being with him, I love coming back after a long day to him. But I am also slowly going insane.

I went through a pretty bad ED a few years ago and am still dealing with some health consequences. He knows I went through an ED, but I don‚Äôt think he understands it was pretty serious since right now, I am healthy weight, maybe even a bit chubby (around 140 lbs, 5‚Äô7).

When staying with him, I have pretty much no freedom to eat. I am still just a visitor in the flat, so I cannot cook or wash my clothes there (which also gets really tiring, having to bring clothes back and forth just to wash them, but it‚Äôs managable).

Most of the days, I go to the office even though I could work from home just so that I can eat throughout the day, so it‚Äôs fine. But on weekends, I struggle a lot, mostly eating around 800 kcal throughout the day (I eat a yoghurt, an apple, get a coffee,‚Ä¶). He himself eats quite a lot, but doesn‚Äôt ask if I‚Äôm hungry too.

I don‚Äôt think he does it on purpose, he mostly just doesn‚Äôt realise what he‚Äôs doing, but I am afraid this will ruin the relationship. I tried subtly bringing it up a few times, but it never seemed like he understood what I was hinting at. Telling him straight up that I need to eat more is really not an option for me because I still feel enormous guilt over food. And when I try, he shoots it down. Like yesterday, we were coming back from a trip and I asked if we should stop by a grocery store on our way back. He asked why we would do that and that was it. Like an hour later, he said ‚Äûactually I don‚Äôt think there is food back at my place for more than one person‚Äú, so we did stop by a shop and I bought myself some cheese and a bread roll, but felt terrible about the whole thing.

I don‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of it, but I am unable to contain my emotions around it anymore. A few days ago, I thought I would faint when outside, just like I did back in my ED days. Then the other day, I was super hungry around 2PM and excited to go to a restaurant where I could eat as a vegetarian when he said he wants to go buy a chicken sandwich, so we went there first and delayed our lunch. I almost cried, had tears in my eyes and was super worried he was gonna notice.

I know this sounds a bit bad but he is a super caring and sweet person and he makes me so happy ~90% of the time. And whenever I can go to the office and eat there, our relationship is fine. It‚Äôs the days we spent together that are super bad for me. 

What should I do? I am considering trying to spend most nights at my place again but I‚Äôm worried he would ask why and it would just make everything worse. ",0,1761652585.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

Most of their recent appearances are in the Time War ranges - makes sense, they‚Äôre the antagonists. But I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs that many ‚Ä¶ Dalek stories. 

What I mean is, there‚Äôs plenty of Time Lord politics and human perspectives and ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô stories (""the Doctor thinks he‚Äôs running a coffee shop! Told in reverse order! On a tape recorder!""), but - unlike, say, *The Apocalypse Element*, *Blood of the Daleks*, *Enemy of the Daleks*, or (perhaps unfairly) *Dalek Empire* \- there‚Äôs very few stories where the Daleks are the drivers of the plot, or that are **about** them. 

Instead they‚Äôre gaolers, or giving chase, or making threats over an intercom. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs been some good Dalek action (*The Neverwhen*, *The War Valeyard*, *A Genius for War*) - but can‚Äôt think of many stories where they‚Äôre the focus (maybe *Restoration of the Daleks*, but that‚Äôs more a Davros story) ‚Ä¶ especially when compared to recent-ish releases\* like *The Dalek Occupation of Winter*, or the *Time Lord Victorious* dramas, where they have a lot of character and presence.

Anyway, posting just because I was curious if others felt the same way (most common complaints about Time War stories seem to be that they‚Äôre not weird enough, or not ruthless enough), and curious whether people who‚Äôd tuned in to more recent War Doctor\*\* or Gallifrey stories felt Skaro‚Äôs finest are getting their due there.

It didn't really explore what her dad's abuse did to her. How it affected her or made her a different person. It missed how it affected her relationship with her mother. Honestly the chemistry between mom and daughter is completely off. Neither does she feel bad for her mom, nor is she angry with her. I don't get it. 

Also Lily SUCKS at communication. Normal people do not behave this way. Why couldn't she just open her mouth and say ""yes he was my ex. It's over now. "" Or why couldn't she introduce him as Atlas since the beginning? Why the hiding. Also why is her interaction with Atlas kinda romanticized in the present day? Like for instance when he comes to the shop after the big fight, Ryle's sister is all awkward and says ""I want to go get coffee."" Or something. Any normal sister would be pissed that he hit her brother? 

If Lily didn't KNOW if she loved Atlas or not, why was she with Ryle? How did they get married without communicating this? Ryle's behaviour isn't justified but I consider what Lily did as micro cheating. 

Also, when another person is very very upset and violent, nobody in their right sense of mind goes behind them. I really do think the staircase thing was an accident which could happen to anyone. 

The cajoling that comes after the abuse and the gaslighting was completely missed. And it's NOT easy to leave ANY relationship that easily. It's not black and white. It goes on and off for a while and then probably ends. 

All I can say is, normal people don't behave this way. ",0,1761652143.0,movies,2,0.14,False

Even after roaming other things like singsaver etc, not confident enough to reach a decision on ""most suitable"" option/card to pursue. (or maybe in the end yall might even discourage me from continuing whelpz)

So here,
(1) intending to only apply 1, at most 2 cards 
(2) low spender: monthly average less than $300
(3) main spending categories: food (often finds myself at mcd/food republic/coffee shops) and public transport (simplygo) 
(4) pretty much no online spending as of now, if yes most likely it ll be me ordering mcd ahead of reaching (or self order for food) 
(5) have accounts in dbs/uob, payment method mainly using dbs debit as of now

Likely options found that I could consider,
(1) trust card: bcos no annual fees xD, but then I dont travel much (or at all) 
(2) Citi cashback cards: not sure if their promos can stack but this seems like a ""worth it"" and/or suits my spending habits thing (available corporate sign-on bonus, but not that impressive)
(3) UOB cards: worried about min spends, experienced people pls do advise!
(4) dbs/posb cards: (posb everyday?) bcos I already have an account/most familiar. This ones gonna be my most ""lazy""/safe option...as long as I ""get to tap on the avoid-debit-card-fraud benefit, im content"" kinda state of mind


Im only looking at cashback and not miles (got to the conclusion that that wasnt worth it for my amount of spending from all the threads I see) .  If an expert on the topic finds themselves here, I ll still be open to related discussion tho. 
After all, im only young fella just started working. (significant) part of my lifestyle is still tied to my family. (and my main milestone now is saving up for BTO) 

Feel free to ask more questions as well (?)

1oi7267,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oi7267,Captivating characters wasted in a 5/10 plot [From a Knight to a Lady],"I've just binged From Knight to lady and, as the title implies, I think it's such a shame that characters this interesting, with captivating dynamics had to be wasted in a poor plot like this one.

Let me start with the positive point:

The main leads chemistry is phenomenal. They've tension, banter, mutual understanding. **They're funny!** Everything that makes up a captivating couple and I love this story for that. If I read this much, it's definitely because of them.

I specially appreciate how be acknowledges her capabilities despite still wanting to protect her. He doesn't see her as a fragile vase and doesn't treat her as a fool who can't take her own decisions.

Tbh he did that in the beginning, but she ate him with black coffee and he apologised.

Anyways, it's a nice and healthy enemies to lovers development and I like that.

Another great quality of this work is the female friendships: OH BOY HOW I LOVE HER FRIENDSHIP WITH LADY LOERüò≠üò≠ they're the cutest ship I swear.

I love the growing sorority from a woman who was once free of the social chains, but so locked up in her own prejudices that she, herself, didn't realise how women high society were struggling as well and they aren't cowards for being unable to break free from the system.

This was GOLD.

*One line of appreciation to the 2nd prince who's everywhere and somehow knows everything. He's an entity, I swear.*

**Now the roastingüçñ**

The plot is weak, the villains aren't even one dimensional, that would still mean they have one well built trait of personality. They don't.

The crown prince's only emotion is anger. The red haired lady hate her for no reason at all and would put her own position at risk for trying to harm this one girl from which she would have NOTHING to win. Plain stupid.

Khalid's only goal in life is being an yandere. He doesn't want anything else other than the fl, which makes one wonder why would he kill her in the first place if he loved her so badly?

To end the war? Oh please, is she a knight or the superman? As good as she might have been, she was just a poor commoner, take her sword away and she wouldn't even have the money to buy another. How killing someone like this is enough to stop the wat, not killing the damn king?

If he hated his ruler so much, he himself could have killed him and ascent to the throne. 

And the possibilities are infinite! Not to talk about how he killed her BEFORE even trying to convince her. His characters is full of flaws and this plot is full of holes.

Even Zed should have killed her when she was in prison. He was merciless, kept chit chatting with the enemy instead of killing her? Stupid. Not him, the plot.

Finally, while I love this story's takes on society and women rights, I DESPISE how they treat war.

It's an awful representation of war, yes our rulers are bad, so why not just lose our independence instead? Makes me wonder: did the author skip history lessons? Did they forget what a foreigner occupation looks like living in KOREA of all places?

There's no such a thing as good wars. No such things as wars where only militaries are harmed, no such a thing as honour and digno for defeated women. It's well recorded in history what happens to women from a defeated country, specially one as sexist as that.

I don't want to make this a gore post, but you know what I'm talking about.

Not to mention how the women of (I forgot the country's name) would eventually lose their rights after the conquest. Zed himself mentions it in passing.

HOW IS THIS POSITIVE? 

I don't have the time to discuss more on it now, so let me get to the last point. SPOILERS AHEAD:

>!SHE LET KHALID LIVE so her knight friends who have already killed thousands of people wouldn't dirt their hands with blood!! Are you fucking kidding me? What did dhe think, that he would sit and watch while she's happy with Zed??!<

That's when I decided to drop it (ch 135) before I started hating the female lead too.

I have more to talk about it, but I have to get ready to work, so let's discuss in the comments ü´∂üèΩ

For info, I‚Äôm in Australia (Queensland when law comes into play). It‚Äôs nothing crazy, just a Barista job. I started about 3 weeks ago. I have worked as barista for 2 years so know my way around this stuff well.

I have noticed the way she runs her cafe is very very strict and ‚Äúperfectionist‚Äù compared to everywhere else I‚Äôve worked. Very anal about wastage, times, flow, etc. totally fair, the way I see it is it‚Äôs her business she runs as she sees fit. It is a bit over the top in some areas in my opinion, but thats just me. Basically she sees it as nothing can go wrong at all or else - you know? She also has her own specific ways to complete work and it must be done her way or else it‚Äôs wrong. Example of what I mean just to get an idea:

Say it‚Äôs a busy rush, you have 10 coffee tickets + more coming and waiting to be made but dishes are starting to pile up. For me, I see it as dishes can be done and completed later - unless you run out of something then yeah do it - but coffees are on a time limit. Smash the coffees, then once there is a short break smash the dishes. To her, you do 4 or 5 coffees, do a load of dishes, 4 or 5 coffees, dishes. Personal ways to do it, but I think obvs the customers order is priority so idk


Now before I start explaining my reasoning and questioning behind everything, please know and try to take into account I have never been told these things before in my entirety of working years. I have always aimed to be a top employee keeping everything together, great relationships with my bosses even after ending employment, sure I have made mistakes with my jobs as we all have, but have never EVER had to be sat down especially so soon. I had been promoted at many jobs and spoken so highly of.

Boss sat me down today and basically told me these key topics:

1. Pointed out a single coffee order I got wrong during a rush yesterday by myself and explained how big of a ‚Äúno no‚Äù that is. She was not happy. It was my first order the customer had returned. In the end customer was not mad, they were happy with the correct coffee and didn‚Äôt complain at all. Said that she cannot have these instances  happening and will start to give warnings

2. I had arrived at 6:02am for a 6:00am start. Yes, that is 2 minutes late and I am not arguing that it‚Äôs okay at all. That morning there was an unexpected backup on the highway and I had to drive the back way in order to get to work - unable to text as I was driving and rushing in. If I had taken the highway I would have arrived 10-15 minutes early, so I did plan accordingly. I didn‚Äôt make excuses or argue, she even asked if I had thought I started at the time on my old roster - but I owned up to it and apologized yet she took it harshly. Only time I had been late (by legit 2 minutes, but I digress). Yes I understand late is late, hence owning up to it

3. Productivity and gossip - so this is the big ones for me. Apparently this is a big issue. When I tell you I am never once ‚Äústopping‚Äù on this job. If there are no coffees, I am cleaning or restocking or helping someone. I NEVER have my phone on my person, I may stop to take a drink of water but am immediately back to work on a job or told a job to do. Please know I have personally reflected on this all day and can say with genuine words that I am not slacking off. My feet hurt after my shifts as I‚Äôm go go go

Key part: she told me she has been watching cameras and sees the team ‚Äúgossiping‚Äù and not working. Absolute lie, yes we will have some chats, but NEVER do we stop what we are doing to talk. Maybe 5 seconds between tasks that‚Äôs it. THEN proceeds to tell me she has audio and has listened to us gossip. What the fuck. She has been listening to us. I have not said a SINGLE bad thing about her, let alone am I on a level with any of my coworkers to have those personal conversations. The only thing that I can remotely think of that would be negative is this:

I asked the chef in private, who I feel I would be ‚Äúclosest‚Äù to, where the last barista is. I even said ‚Äúif it‚Äôs a big situation don‚Äôt tell me, I‚Äôm not wanting to talk shit, I‚Äôm just curious‚Äù. Chef said the last barista had issues with the boss and left, I said okay. Chef then made a comment on how one day of my training my boss was talking to me for probably about an hour on how to make smoothies and I looked like I was struggling to stay focused on her. I just said ‚Äúyeah it was a lot of information that day‚Äù. That‚Äôs all. Writing it out, yes I see how it could be seen as ‚Äúgossiping‚Äù but that‚Äôs the only instance that ever happened and that was 2 weeks ago.

Boss said she had been watching cameras all day today and saw the team talking talking talking and had been listening. We hadn‚Äôt spoken about the job or about anyone negatively, just small talk about ourselves while keeping busy. She made it into a big deal and said she found it very disrespectful, but never told me what she had heard. 

There are many other small things - including me not responding to text messages within 1-2 hours when it‚Äôs outside of work hours, my roster and hours are changed everyday, I was employed on the agreement of 30 hours (casual employment, so just personal agreement no legal standing, yes I know partly my fault) but have been having 15-25hr weeks with promises it will pick up.

Edit to add: don‚Äôt know how I missed this part but at the end of the conversation she told me that I should think about everything and let her know if this is somewhere I want to continue working.

- **Market & Financial Risks:** Exposure to interest rate hikes, FX fluctuations (notable as ‚Ç¨10B of FX forwards entered for acquisition), and commodity volatility.
- **Margins Pressured:** Despite strong sales, both gross and operating margins declined due to inflation and unfavorable mix, especially in the coffee business.

**Outlook:**
- KDP remains focused on organic and acquisitive growth, supported by a strong balance sheet, but faces elevated near-term risk owing to the execution of two major strategic actions: the JDE Peet‚Äôs acquisition and planned business separation.
- Capital structure will be stressed until the acquisition is funded and integration risks subsided.
- Management is committed to maintaining investment grade ratings post-separation; however, outlooks from rating agencies are currently negative or under review.

**Investor Considerations:**
- Strong revenue and bottom line growth, but with narrowing margins and higher interest expense.
- Near-term exposures include significant execution, financial, and integration risks tied to transformational M&A.
- Strategic transformation offers long-term opportunity, but elevated uncertainty and leverage may lead to near-term volatility in both business performance and the stock price.

I'm getting bored again with my current setup and I think I'm leaning toward a faster workflow and more espresso. I've used in no order:

* Drip coffee machine- wanted to get away from plastic
* Chemex with baratza encore- got bored
* Breville bambino plus- hated small drip tray
* Niche grinder- felt buyers remorse
* Breville barista express-annoying cleaning it, heavy
* Nespresso original machine- plastic creeped me out
* V60 with comandante grinder- using this by far the longest
* Moka pot- really enjoying this, just take a while

I'm wondering about the OutIn fino with nano? Faster grind time and back to espresso intrigues me. Worried about the build quality and if the espresso tastes more like Nespresso.",1,1761651472.0,coffeestations,1,1.0,False

Does he have any chill? Does he just collect crazy levels of wealth for a hobby? I get it part of their job, but once he signed up for the coffee company even though he hates coffee I felt like that was when I couldn't help but see this as pure greed. Its just getting weird, when other members have  like 2-3 brands max or like Yoongi who doesn't seem to want any. Honestly with Tae's popularity dropping fast, its a dumb choice for TirTir. I don't think itl'll fully backfire or anyting, but still, this brand is popular internationall without him and real Koreans don't use it that much, they have other cushion foundations that are viral for them.

Wake up to the morning light

Coffee brewing, feeling right

Got that rhythm in my soul

Taking life and taking control



Walking down the city street

Every step‚Äôs got its own beat

People rushing left and right

But I‚Äôm groovin‚Äô through the light



\[Pre-Chorus\]

Don‚Äôt need to rush, don‚Äôt need to slow

Just finding where I need to go

Life‚Äôs a song and I‚Äôm the DJ

Mixing up my perfect day



\[Chorus\]

Good tempo, that‚Äôs the way to go

Moving smooth but never out of flow

Good tempo, feeling so alive

In the rhythm, that‚Äôs where I thrive

Good tempo, good tempo

That‚Äôs the secret that I know

Good tempo, good tempo

Let the music take control



\[Verse 2\]

Dancing through my daily grind

Leave the worries far behind

Every task becomes a dance

Give yourself a fighting chance



When the pressure‚Äôs getting high

Take a breath and feel the vibe

Find the beat inside your heart

That‚Äôs the place where you should start



\[Pre-Chorus\]

Some days fast, some days slow

That‚Äôs just how life likes to flow

But if you listen to the sound

Your perfect pace can be found



\[Chorus\]

Good tempo, that‚Äôs the way to go

Moving smooth but never out of flow

Good tempo, feeling so alive

In the rhythm, that‚Äôs where I thrive

Good tempo, good tempo

That‚Äôs the secret that I know

Good tempo, good tempo

Let the music take control



\[Bridge\]

When the world spins way too fast

Slow it down, make moments last

When you‚Äôre stuck in neutral gear

Shift it up and disappear



It‚Äôs not about the speed you choose

It‚Äôs finding rhythm you can‚Äôt lose

Every heartbeat, every breath

Dancing with life ‚Äôtil your last step



\[Final Chorus\]

Good tempo, that‚Äôs my philosophy

Living life in harmony

Good tempo, never miss a beat

Moving to my own drumbeat

Good tempo, good tempo

Now I‚Äôm flying high and low

Good tempo, good tempo

This is how I choose to grow



\[Outro\]

Good tempo, good tempo

That‚Äôs the only way I know

Good tempo, good tempo

Let your natural rhythm show

You might be *partly*¬†right. But no one will tell you about the¬†*real curriculum*¬†\-one that doesn't show up on the timetable.

The actual learnings- 

**Thinking on your feet**: You could be called to speak in class without warning. Whether you‚Äôve read the case or not what you say¬†*still*¬†needs to sound sharp. Cold calls are very popular !!

**Managing time like a juggler**: One moment you're prepping for a group presentation, the next you're solving some statistic question, and somewhere in between you‚Äôre trying to finish that marketing simulation that‚Äôs due in 45 minutes. Also, making reports for the simulation is too time taking.

**Data doesn‚Äôt lie, but it does confuse**: Excel formulas, pivot tables, and dashboards are all fun and games‚Ä¶ until your sheet crashes at 3 AM.

**Feedback is your friend**: From professors, peers, or recruiters whether it‚Äôs constructive, critical, or brutally honest, you learn to¬†*take it, apply it, and move forward.*

**Group work is a mirror**: You see the best and worst of people including yourself. You learn patience, conflict resolution, and how to¬†*actually*¬†listen. Lot of group projects will be there. Please be prepared.

**Friendships are formed over midnight coffees and last-minute panic**: Nothing bonds people like presentation anxiety and Maggi at 2 AM.

**Leadership is silent**: It‚Äôs not always the one talking the most. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the one ensuring everyone‚Äôs voice is heard.

And yes, you will still learn strategy frameworks, marketing funnels, and financial models. But the biggest takeaways?  


**Resilience. Clarity under pressure. The power of people. And the courage to keep going even when you have no idea what‚Äôs next.**

An MBA doesn‚Äôt just prepare you for business.  
It prepares you for¬†*life.*

The chaos, the learning curves, the people -you grow through it all.

Here‚Äôs to the journey so far, and all that‚Äôs still to come.

1oi6oqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oi6oqp/aita_for_secretly_swapping_my_dads_debit_card/,"AITA for secretly swapping my dad‚Äôs debit card with a lookalike ‚Äútraining wheels‚Äù card after $1,527 of weird charges in 6 days","I 34m am the spreadsheet kid in my family. My sister Lena 36f is the vibes kid. Dad is 68, a retired mail carrier who can fix any squeaky hinge with WD-40 and a paper towel. He also got diagnosed in March with mild cognitive impairment, not dementia yet, but the doctor used the phrase memory hiccups, and that stuck in my head. He still lives alone in his small blue house with the fake stone mailbox he hates. We set up a routine, meds in a day box, groceries Tuesdays, I check in nightly on FaceTime. Dad hates fuss, he says I am managing him like a FedEx package.   
Two weeks ago I was going through his bank app because he asked why his balance was lower than usual. He gives me read only access and I do bill pay with him on speaker so he feels in control. I see a $487.19 Bass Pro charge, a $316.44 donation to something called American Police Family Relief that looked like a robocall charity, three Apple Pay tries at a liquor store he does not use, all declined, and two DoorDash orders to my sister‚Äôs address, total $86.72. There was also a $199 tech support subscription, the kind that pops up when you get a fake virus alert. This is over six days. Dad swears he bought only one new fishing net for $30 and a tray of freezer lasagna. Lena says she didn‚Äôt use his card, she says he told her to order wings and gas one night, which is a thing he does, he tips big because he remembers being tired and hungry on late routes. But the timestamps were 1.07 am and 1.23 am, Dad is asleep by 10, and the address was hers, not his.   
I called Bass Pro, they said the receipt was for a fish finder he never wanted and a camo jacket size XL. Dad is a medium and he jokes that fish should find us. I asked if they could hold pickup. It had already left. DoorDash refunded only one order after I explained, the other they said came from a device that has ordered before. Lena said that was probably when he visited. He has not been to her apartment since May. The charity number routed to hold music with a bald eagle noise. I could feel my neck doing the hot thing.   
The bank would cancel the card and reissue. Dad hates waiting for mail and I knew he would hand the new PIN to whoever asked nicely on the phone. His wallet has two identical slots. My dumb brain hatched a plan that felt smart at 1 am. There is a card called True Link, it is designed for elders, you can set daily limits, block phone and online orders, block 800 numbers, kill liquor stores and subscriptions by merchant code, but still allow grocery and pharmacy. I ordered one with his name. It looks like any normal silver debit. I also opened a linked account with a weekly auto transfer of 200 and a manual top up button so he never gets stuck at a pharmacy.   
Saturday I went over with kolaches and WD-40 for his back gate that squeaked. We drank Folgers that tastes like a penny, he loves it. I said the bank sent a backup in case of fraud. I asked to check his wallet so I could move the medic alert card in front. While he was searching for his reading glasses that were already on his head, I swapped the old debit for the True Link and slid the old one in an envelope in my backpack. I know, that line sounds bad even as I type it. I told myself it was the same as screwing training wheels on a bike, you still ride, you just dont fall as far.   
For a week it was boring in the best way. He bought pork chops, a gas station coffee, his pharmacy copay, and tipped the barber 10 on a 20 cut. No weird. I got notifications when he tried to pay the door to door kids who sell coupon books for 40 each. It declined, and he called me, annoyed, said my bank is broken, then laughed, then forgot why he called and asked if I wanted his old sockets. I turned on a one hour window so he could donate 10 at church, because he likes to put something in the plate, and I did not want to be the card police.   
Then everything blew. Lena took him to Costco to buy a TV mount. At checkout she added a Dyson stick vacuum to the cart on his card, 399.99, because hers broke, she says she would pay him back next month, she says he offered. The card declined, twice, because of my 200 limit. She called me on speaker in the aisle, furious, with Dad there in the cart bay playing with the tape gun. I tried to quickly lift the limit and the app spun. People stared. Lena said stop humiliating our father, you locked his money away. Dad said loudly my own son does not let me buy a stupid vacuum, which got a laugh from a guy with samples. I felt like a criminal.   
We got home and I told the full truth. I pulled the envelope with his original debit and put it on the table. I showed both of them the line items, the sketchy charity, the tech scam, the DoorDash to her address at 1.07 am. Lena said it was late because she works night shifts sometimes, and Dad does call her to get him things, so what, and she hates how I act like the only adult. She said I am using the diagnosis to grab power and that Dad would rather risk small mistakes than have me run his life like a call center. Dad nodded, then looked at the Bass Pro jacket and said I do not wear camouflage, then looked at me and said, quietly, you could have asked me first.   
We argued in loops. I was shaking. I kept hearing the doctor saying hiccups, not dementia, and I felt stupid. I also felt like Lena had been helping herself and wrapped it in filial piety. She Venmoed Dad 80 during the fight and said see I pay. I have not seen any repayments on his bank in months before that. I wanted to blurt that out and I swallowed it.   
I apologized for the swap, not for the intent. I handed back his debit card and said his money, his rules. I also said I would keep the True Link active if he wanted bumpers for telemarketers, that I could put the limit to 1000 and remove the block on Costco and still keep the subscription block. He said he needs time. That night there were three missed calls from an 833 number and a 49.99 charge attempt that failed because the old debit was still frozen from last week. He called me in the morning to ask who keeps calling with prizes.   
Lena posted in our family group chat that I stole Dad‚Äôs autonomy. My aunt called me a control freak. Mom is gone, so it is just me and the shouting. I get that I should have asked. I cannot unsee the $1,527 and the rattle of his hands when he tries to type his PIN. I was trying to let him be independent without letting random people eat his retirement. But I lied by omission and I swapped a card behind his back.   
  
AITA for doing a stealth card swap to keep Dad safe before he agreed to it

1oi6n9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectrumMobile/comments/1oi6n9a/my_2025_iptv_rankings_too_much_coffee_channel/,"My 2025 IPTV Rankings: Too Much Coffee, Channel Overload & a Few Surprises","This year, I set out to find the **best iptv providers** for my ever-evolving TV habits. As someone who flips between US sports, UK quiz shows, Canadian news, and the odd EU foodie documentary‚Äîusually with a strong coffee in hand‚ÄîI‚Äôve tried more services than I care to admit. Here‚Äôs my honest 2025 ranking for anyone hunting for their next [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/).

# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (discounts on annual plans)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, EU, and plenty more)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams reliably, even when I‚Äôm multitasking across devices)
* **Firestick Experience:** Setup was hassle-free on my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** I came across IPTVMEEZZY after a friend who‚Äôs an **iptv reseller** mentioned their **free trial**. What stood out? The range‚Äîone night I‚Äôm watching American football, the next morning it‚Äôs UK breakfast TV, and I‚Äôve even dabbled in a few random EU channels. The platform just works, no matter what device or time of day. Even during big live events, the stream rarely trips up.

# 2. VistaPlay TV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 31,000+ live, 100,000+ VOD (strong US/UK lineup, with a decent CA/EU backbone)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (generally solid, though peak US sports nights can introduce some lag)
* **Firestick Experience:** Works straight away on my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** VistaPlay was an unexpected favorite. I first tried it because of a **free trial** offer and wound up using it for a lot of UK panel shows and Canadian morning news. The EPG is easy enough to navigate, though I did notice a little buffering during a big US playoff game. Still, for day-to-day watching, it‚Äôs pretty consistent.

# 3. EuroBeam IPTV

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 25,500+ live, 85,000+ VOD (EU/UK focus, with all key US/CA channels)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (works well for movies and regular channels, but EU sports finals can test it)
* **Firestick Experience:** No issues installing on my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** EuroBeam is my ‚Äúlate-night foreign film‚Äù pick. The VOD collection is surprisingly deep‚Äîlots of German, French, and even some Scandinavian channels tucked away. Most nights are hiccup-free, but during major EU football matches, I did see some stutter. Still, for discovering new stuff, it‚Äôs a fun option.

# 4. MapleConnect Streams

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 60,000+ VOD (heavy on CA/US, with UK/EU essentials)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (solid for daily use, live news is quick, but big events can slow down)
* **Firestick Experience:** Easy to use on my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** MapleConnect is my ‚Äúbackground TV‚Äù choice. It‚Äôs great for having Canadian news rolling in the kitchen or catching up on US talk shows while I work. Their **free trial** made it a no-brainer to test, and while it‚Äôs not the flashiest, it gets the job done for everyday streaming.

# IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Channel Surfing

* **Always try the free trial**‚Äîit‚Äôs the best way to see if a service really fits your needs and devices.
* Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) providers can lag during huge live events, especially in the US or EU.
* I always return to my handful of favorite channels, no matter how huge the lineup is.
* Using an **iptv firestick** makes setup and everyday use so much easier (and more couch-friendly).
* If you‚Äôre thinking about being an **iptv reseller**, get ready for tech questions from everyone you know.

No matter where you are‚ÄîUS, UK, CA, EU‚Äîfinding a great **iptv subscription 2025** is about matching your habits and lifestyle. If you‚Äôve found a hidden gem, let me know. For now, I‚Äôll be here, coffee mug in hand, channel surfing around the world.",1,1761650450.0,SpectrumMobile,1,1.0,False
1oi6mt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1oi6mt0/im_a_woman_and_i_creep_men_out_feels_bad/,I'm a woman and I creep men out. Feels bad.,"I might just be psychologically broken and interpreting things wrong so I'm taking myself with a grain of salt but even then it feels...sad lol

I'll start with this: If I'm walking behind a person at night or low light, I feel bad and threatening. I always hold doors open for people. I always do small courtesy talking to the public/strangers. I feel like a monster hiding that I am one.

When I sit next to guys, or wait behind them in line or whatever, I feel like a creep that disgusts them. Even if they could crush me easily. I feel this way because I get odd looks or doors shut on me. I genuinely feel guilty to be upsetting the public.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I put a lot of work the past 10 years (I'm 28) in becoming a person like anyone else. I'm big on hygiene and toiletries cause they're fun, so I don't think I smell bad. I've developed a sense of style and tried light makeup to touch up. I put a lot of work in being like anyone else but still feel like a dirty freak.

 I could lose 20lbs and try to reach an idea of perfection for my body, I could pursue plastic surgery on my nose or something. I guess I figured I could get by in society by being average but I am not average enough. I feel this is rude to say but even other chunky or bold styled people seem to have no issue finding friends and love for their personality. 

Anyways I write this cause I stood next to a random guy when we were both waiting for our coffee orders. I didn't think anything of it till he glanced at me and scurried away to wait closer towards the door. I was more than an arms length away, but I keep feeling sorry like I disturbed him. Then upset that people don't even want me standing near them. It was really embarassing.

I feel like the only woman with this problem. It eats me alive. Thanks for reading.",13,1761650410.0,self,24,0.88,False

Did some prep work with the students yesterday. They're in the middle of some novel groups, and we're writing personal narratives. Today, each class is just 50% time to write, 50% time to read. That means 100% time for me to sit back and read something I actually want to read. Well, more like 95% time for that. I will need to spend some time looking around to make sure the students are doing what they're supposed to do. 

But they usually stay on task for days like these. They love typing their own narratives. I tend to shun the 1:1 tech most days, so an entire half of a period for them to just type is still a novelty for them. They love quiet reading time, too. It helps that I have comfortable seating options for them when they're just reading in my room. They can literally ""snuggle up"" with a good book in my classroom. 

So can I. 

Yes, it's going to be a good, easy day for me, and I'm excited for it. I may even stop for a coffee on the way to work. Or, dare I say, I may even Door Dash myself a nice lunch. Might as well make it the perfect day at work. ",4,1761650244.0,Teachers,0,1.0,False

# Training

You might have seen my post a couple of months ago about a Half Marathon I ran ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1mue33e/race\_report\_athy\_half\_marathon\_an\_amazing\_day/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1mue33e/race_report_athy_half_marathon_an_amazing_day/)). Training hasn't changed much in the two months between the races, so I won't report everything here, but there have been some changes: a general increase in mileage with most weeks being between 110 and 120km (68 to 74 miles) -with a drop in cross-training due to lack of time-, and more focus on workouts at, or around, marathon pace (2:50 was my main goal, so roughly 4 min/km, or 6:26 per mile). I also started running every day, missing only 2 days -one planned, two days before the race- of running in the \~70 days between the two races.

Some examples of workouts that I did in the last two months of training:

7 weeks out: 22km, 18 of which at just slightly slower than MP 5 weeks out: 5 x 14 mins at 3:50/km pace (slightly slower than my HM pace) 4 weeks out: 24km, 20 of which at MP 3 weeks out: 5 x 16 mins at 3:50/km pace

Note that the runs at MP were not my long runs; my coach's prefers me to run long runs at easy pace, and keep MP for this medium/long runs.

Of these, the 20km at MP was probably the biggest confidence boost: despite running them on a fairly hilly course, and in suboptimal conditions (in the afternoon, while I'm more of a morning runner) after a though day at work, I nailed it, keeping all splits within 1 or 2 seconds of the goal, and still feeling fresh after it.

Other than this, due to personal reasons I had to move my hardest workouts on a Wed, which is also the day I do S&C at the local gym. While this has been a big challenge, I feel like it had a beneficial effect, at least psychologically. Running hard for \~90 mins, hitting the gym, and then still being able to go for a run the morning after and feeling relatively fresh gave me a lot of confidence in how my body was handling the training load.

Finally, I kept inserting hills in my long and medium/long runs, trying to add more and more of them. This was definitely a great choice that paid really well on race day (more on that later!)

# Pre-race

After two weeks of gradual tapering -still running every day, but with a gradual drop in intensity and mileage), I came into the last days feeling fairly good; despite my right knee giving me some issues, and a tendency of my glutes to tighten up during hard efforts, especially when running on an incline, the body felt overall ready for this last push.

The forecast was for a very cold start with moderate winds, and my coach and I agreed on a conservative pacing plan: since the goal of 2:50 corresponds roughly to running a 20:05 5km pace, we decided to start just slightly slower than that, keep the effort for the first 10km (with a gentle but long climb), and then readjust every \~5km based on feeling.

As usual with my races, the plan went out of the window after 1km!

# Race

With a start time of 8:45am, I woke up at 6am (making use of the extra hour of sleep due to the time change) and went through my usual routine:

* Coffee (espresso) + breakfast (porridge + yogurt, chocolate shavings, chia seeds and half a banana)
* Shot of beetroot juice
* Double and triple check my gear race and my bag that I would drop at the start
* Pre-race exercise routine: massage gun, calf raises, couch stretch, knees-over-toes)

Then I took a rental bike to get as close as possible to the start line, knowing real well from last year experience that the walk to the start line would be brutally long. After nearly 5k steps I finally make it to the bag drop area, change my shoes (I raced in Alphafly 3s), get a trash bag to use to protect from the wind, and drop my stuff.

The next 30 mins are just a painful lesson that being cheap doesn't pay: while nearly everyone else has brought clothes they are comfortable throwing away at the start, I have a stupid trash bag that barely protects me from the wind. It is pretty cold (6C/48F but with a windchill of 0C/32F) and I am really regretting it, as wind gusts are very strong and all it starts to feel like all my warmup has been for nothing.

At last, with 5 mins to go, the crowd starts to get together at the start line (and I get some cover from the wind, being generally shorter than many people) while we wait for the gun to go off!

The first few km are fairly uneventful: the streets are really crowded (including people that have no business being in front and making everything dangerous for everyone, including them) and it takes me a couple of miles to get in the groove and find my pace. After the first 5km, which are fairly flat and fast, I am a few seconds faster than planned: I take mental note but I decide not to adjust my pace; I feel better than expected at this pace and I trust my body.

Shortly after 5km starts the long drag through Phoenix Park: this is a beautiful park just outside the city centre; it's one of the biggest urban parks in the world, being more than twice the size of Central Park in NYC. It is traversed for its whole length by a perfectly straight, and gently uphill, road. The crowd support is incredible, and I'm still buzzing feeling fresh and fast, so I barely notice the incline and keep pushing at my own pace. I stick with other runners for short amount of times but I generally find myself leaving them behind fairly soon.

At the 10km mark, I notice that despite the slight incline I even picked up my pace more: I take another mental note on that, and spend a few seconds pondering whether I should worry I'm going out too fast... Since the next 5km are all fairly downhill, and the 5k after are mostly flat, I decide I can just keep this pace and run at a slightly easier effort until halfway, and reassess there.

As I said, from 10km to 15km the course is mostly downhill, bordering Phoenix Park once again, and then re-entering it through some backroads. While running feels much easier on this downhill part, it is one of the very few areas with very little crowd support. That's why I'm very happy when, at around mile 10, I spot a big group of people from my Athletics Club cheering me on, and a few hundreds meter after, my wife holding a sign for me. On the buzz of this energy boost, I cruise until halfway through: I pass the half marathon mark in 1:22:40. This is definitely way faster than what we planned with my coach (which would have been closer to 1:24:xx) but the realisation of 2:45 being on the table is a great feeling and I still can't worry too much.

Just after the halfway point is where things start to be harder... the wind picks up and blows straight into the runners. That, combined with a few scattered climbs, makes me wonder whether I went out too cocky and I am going to regret it. I spend the next 3km wondering whether I should slow down a bit, given that 2:50 is still pretty much doable, but I also know that when you accept the need to slow down it's a slippery slope. Thankfully, at 24km the course takes a turn and the wind is now not blowing anymore against me and I am able to breathe a bit and keep my pace.

The rest of the race up to the 40th km is a bit blurred in my mind, but some things that I definitely remember are:

* Hills pay the bills! There are several short but steep climbs in the last third of the race, and without even struggling I find myself overtaking several other runners. As I said before, I have been training on hills a lot, and this really paid off here; while other runners were struggling on these, I kept breezing through with a great running form and keeping my sub 4:00 min/km pace intact
* Side stitches: I almost never experience them, but I started feeling them a bit at around 35km not even knowing how to deal with them; they thankfully went away on their own
* The threat of cramps: for a long stretch of road after km 35, especially on the downhill parts, my right calf constantly felt as it was about to cramp.. I tried massaging it while running without slowing down, and the threat never materialised itself, thankfully.

Just before KM 40, I do some quick mental math and realize that 2:45 is still on the table, but I need to pick up the pace and run around 3:50/km for the remainder of the race. As soon as I try, however, I realize my running form has terribly degraded: I'm not generating power, my body is all tightened up, and the next 2km will be miserable! And indeed they are: despite an AMAZING crowd cheering me on, I am unable to run under 4:00/km despite an overall favourable course. I get a small second wind about half a mile before the end, slightly pick up the pace, and finish strong with a HUGE smile on my face!

In the end, my chip time will be 2:45:34, a MASSIVE 32 mins PB, almost 5 mins faster than my goal time, and definitely a cutoff-safe BQ!

# Post-race

As soon as I cross the finish line, my body seizes up and I'm in a world of pain: I am offered a wheelchair which I refuse out of stupid pride, and when I go to change my shoes, it takes me 15 mins as my body cramps up as soon as I try to do anything. But none of that can wipe my big, stupid smile from my face. I am crying, laughing, hugging my wife and I am the happiest person in the world. I enjoy a well-earned pizza, a few pints and I just enjoy this amazing day, the culmination of 10 months of hard and consistent training!

I'm not sure what I will be focusing it in the future: I probably won't be racing again this year, though I am thinking about a few mountain running races that might pick with interest. What comes after is still unclear: while I was eyeing a few ultras, I am also now considering just sticking to marathons.

It was emotional and tense, but also strangely familiar and comforting. We talked about the breakup and I told him how sorry I was for the way things ended. He said he‚Äôs accepted it, that he thinks it‚Äôs better this way, and that he saw how the relationship had drained me. Hearing that hurt deeply. He also told me he‚Äôs dated quite a few people since, which was like a punch to the gut. I kept my composure, but inside I felt replaced and forgotten.

Even though I know I can‚Äôt change his mind or undo the past, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him, about how natural it felt to be together again, and how final it now seems. I‚Äôm proud that I was honest and calm, but the emptiness today is brutal. Part of me still hopes he‚Äôll realize what we had, and another part knows I need to start accepting that this chapter really is over.

1oi6hc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1oi6hc5/the_whale_hunting_audience_strategy_that_5xd_our/,The 'Whale Hunting' Audience Strategy That 5x'd Our AOV on Meta (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Target Rich People),"So last year I had what I can only describe as a mild existential crisis while looking at my Meta ads dashboard.

We were selling premium home decor. Think $400 throw pillows and $2,000 coffee tables that look like they came from a museum gift shop. Our ROAS was... fine. 

Like a solid 3.2x. But our average order value was stuck at $180 and I'm sitting there thinking ""WHO is buying a single $180 item from us when our hero products are $800+?""

Turns out, pretty much everyone. Because I was targeting everyone.

I was running your standard lookalike audiences, interest stacks like ""interior design"" and ""luxury lifestyle,"" and patting myself on the back for being so strategic. 

Meanwhile I'm bleeding money showing $1,800 armchairs to people shopping at IKEA.

**Then I had a dumb realization...**

Not all customers are created equal. Groundbreaking, I know. But here's the thing - I was treating Meta like a democratic platform. Show ads to lots of people, let them self-select, hope for the best.

That's great if you're selling $20 phone cases. Not great if you need customers who think dropping $800 on a side table is ""reasonable.""

So I decided to go whale hunting. And I'm not talking about your standard ""high-income"" targeting that everyone and their mom is already doing.

**Here's what actually worked!!**

First, I stopped thinking about demographics and started thinking about behavior patterns. Rich people don't go around clicking ""yes I'm wealthy"" on surveys. But they DO leave digital breadcrumbs everywhere.

I started layering audiences like I was making a bougie lasagna:

* People who engaged with luxury automotive brands (not car enthusiasts - people engaging with Porsche, Range Rover, Tesla Model S content)
* Zip codes with median home values over $800K (you can do this, it's just annoying to set up)
* People who recently moved into expensive neighborhoods (life events + location = money spent on furniture)
* Engagement with private school and country club pages
* Travel patterns showing business class flights and 5-star hotels

But here's where it got interesting. I wasn't just stacking these audiences and calling it a day. I built a tiered system.

***The ""Yacht Club"" tier:*** All of the above + people who'd visited our site and looked at products over $500. Small audience, like 40K people, but these folks had MONEY.

***The ""Aspirational"" tier:*** Showed wealth signals but also engaged with financing content and ""save for later"" behaviors. Still had buying power but needed different messaging.

***The ""New Money"" tier*****:** Recent job changes to executive positions, sudden income jumps, people moving from low to high COL areas. They're about to spend but don't have established buying patterns yet.

I created completely different campaigns for each tier. Different creative, different offers, different EVERYTHING.

For the Yacht Club tier, I removed ALL discounts. Just beautiful product photography and messaging around ""investment pieces"" and ""heirloom quality."" Sounds pretentious but it WORKED.

For New Money, I went hard on ""you've earned this"" messaging and showed how our stuff compared to the garbage they used to buy.

**The results were honestly stupid...**

Within 6 weeks, our average order value went from $180 to $890. Our ROAS dropped initially (which freaked me out) from 3.2x to 2.4x, but our PROFIT per order went through the roof.

We were spending more per purchase but making 3-4x more profit per customer. The math suddenly made sense.

The Yacht Club campaign? $12 CPMs (ouch) but 8.9% conversion rate and $1,200 AOV. I'll take that trade all day.

The kicker? Our customer lifetime value from these segments was INSANE. People who bought once came back and bought again within 90 days. Turns out wealthy people who like nice things buy A LOT of nice things.

**Here's what I learned**

Stop trying to make $200 customers spend $800. Find the people already spending $800 and make them aware you exist.

I also discovered Meta's ""wealth indicators"" are way more sophisticated than people think. The algorithm KNOWS who has money based on thousands of behavioral signals we can't even see. You just need to give it the right training data.

I started feeding our pixel ONLY high-value purchases for lookalikes. Excluded anyone who'd purchased under $300. Sounds crazy but the lookalikes got scary good at finding big spenders.

One more thing - and this might be controversial - I started excluding anyone who'd engaged with discount/coupon sites in the last 30 days. Sounds elitist but coupon hunters weren't our customer and they were eating up impression share.

**The setup took about 2 weeks and felt ridiculous while I was doing it.** 

My business partner literally asked if I was ""trying to make Meta ads classist."" Maybe? But also we're not a charity, we're selling $2K coffee tables.

I built this whole targeting system with audience layering rules, LTV prediction models based on first purchase behavior, and automatic exclusions for low-value segments. It's like 47 different audiences now but it PRINTS.

Happy to share the exact audience stack and how I structure the campaigns if anyone wants it. Fair warning: this works way better for premium products. If you're selling budget stuff, this is probably overkill.

Also yes, I'm aware targeting rich people isn't exactly revolutionary. But the WAY you do it matters. Most people are way too broad and wonder why their luxury product ads aren't working.

Anyone else doing wealth-based segmentation or am I just late to this party? Would love to hear what's working for other premium brands.",9,1761649911.0,FacebookAds,4,0.85,False

1oi6et3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1oi6et3/trip_debrief_focused_on_practicalities/,Trip Debrief focused on practicalities,"Hi all, we just returned from a 2-week trip and wanted to share back to this group our experience. This is more focused on practicalities rather than what to do or see (although there is a bit of that as well)

**Itinerary**

   * Our travel and stay was more or less like this. Sometimes we departed a location in the morning and other times in the afternoon so take the days in each location with a pinch of salt.
   * Osaka (2 days) ‚Äì Kyoto (3 days) ‚Äì Tokyo (4 days) ‚Äì Kawaguchiko (Mt. Fuji) (2 days) ‚Äì Osaka (2 days)
   * We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids aged 10 and 15). We don‚Äôt generally allow the kids to take their devices on family vacations although they took their phones this time so they could take pictures but we didn‚Äôt enable cellular on their phones (why this matters later).

**Arriving**

* eSim
   * We setup our eSIM card the day before. We used Ubigi. I got a 10GB package for me and for my wife. I activated mine first and got a referral coupon which we applied to my wife‚Äôs data package so she got a 20% discount.
   * When she activated hers, I got another coupon for 50% discount. This could‚Äôve been useful in case we needed to top-up but we didn‚Äôt need to.10GB was more than enough for the 2 weeks. We used google maps, apple maps, whatsapp (to send photos to family and friends), safari, and some posting of IG stories but neither I nor my wife are heavy social media consumers. Your mileage may vary.
* IC cards
   * We landed in Osaka so we got the ICOCA card. We had to go to the ticket office because my daughter is 10 years and we needed to show proof of age ‚Äì she got a discounted ICOCA with her name ‚Äì we kept it as a souvenir. ICOCA worked in all of our locations.
   * Since the kids didn‚Äôt have their devices connected, we all got physical ICOCA cards. I don‚Äôt know if you need connectivity on the device to use the IC card so we went ‚Äúold school‚Äù. It was perfect.
   * Nankai Rapi:t Express got us from KIX to Namba in 40 mins ‚Äì easy but do note that the ICOCA does not work on this line. You need to buy tickets

**During**

* Osaka:
   * both times we stayed close to Dotonbori. Super easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. A really nice area with a great vibe.
   * The day after we arrived we visited the Expo. It was the last day of the Expo. After reading here that we should avoid it, I am glad we went. The atmosphere was amazing and the pavilions we visited were all super nice.
* Kyoto:
   * I wish we had one more day. Kyoto is VERY crowded with tourists. We stayed in an AirBnB just below the main station and it is a nice neighborhood with some hidden gems for food/dinner.
   * Gion was too crowded but still nice.
   * When we visited the Bamboo forest it was not overly crowded but inside there is Okochi sanso garden. Because you need to pay an extra ticket to get it, it was empty and very quiet and so beautiful. This was amazing for us. (there is even a rest area where you can have a free cup of tea or Calpis).
   * The day before we left to Tokyo we went to Nishiki market. It was probably my favourite market in Japan.
* Tokyo ‚Äì What to say about Tokyo?
   * Amazing. The city, the parks, getting lost, finding our way‚Ä¶ just go and enjoy it. Something we did that I haven‚Äôt seen too much on here was a Cooking class. We took a morning class and cooked Gyozas and Ramen. Super cool and the kids loved it.
   * I have a college friend in Tokyo that I hadn‚Äôt seen in 20 years so managed to meet with him and he gave us a lot of tips as a local person. This was a highlight. The kids actually thought dad is a cool guy. This sentiment lasted a full day.
   * Some advice I read here is to stay away from Shibuya and Shinjuku for accommodation as it is too crowded. This is true but we stayed in Shibuya and it was awesome for us. Shinjuku would‚Äôve worked as well to be honest. We just found the hotel in Shibuya first. We visited Asakusa and many people here recommend staying there. I would not but that is a personal choice (I thought Senso-ji¬†temple was more hype than anything else).
   * The subway lines seem complicated but if know your colors and can recognize the letters JA, JY, JR, etc. it is simple and straightforward. My 15 year old son was navigating the subway like an expert after 1 day.
* Fujikawaguchiko:
   * the first day it was cloudy and some rain so we couldn‚Äôt see Mt. Fuji but we made the best of it. There is a craft shop where you can just go and we felt like locals. The kids made some candles and they have a really nice souvenir. It was nice to slow down and observe the Japanese art of discipline if that makes any sense at all. It was very peaceful.
   * Second day it was sunny and we saw Mt. Fuji and explored the area. There is a bus system (red, green, etc.) that is also easy to navigate. If you know your colors this should also be easy.
   * The food here seems to be very much around barbecuing. There is a staple which is chicken cutlet that you finish off the cooking at the table. It‚Äôs good, trust me.
   * We went back to Osaka (since we were departing from KIX). We took a bus to Mishima and then the Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka. We bought the bus ticket the day we arrived so we could secure our schedule but the Shinkansen tickets we bought when we arrived at Mishima and it was fine. It was a longer internal travel day. Perhaps a better choice would've been to plan the Mt. Fuji trip in between the Tokyo stay. We live and learn.¬†

¬†**Random notes:**

   * We used the subway and train lines except twice. In Kyoto the buses were super crowded and packed so after a long day we decided to take a taxi back to the AirBnB. The second time was on our departure day from Osaka to KIX. We could‚Äôve used the luggage forwarding service to send the luggage straight to KIX but decided not to because timings were tight.
   * All hotels and the Kyoto AirBnB had strong wifi
   * Luggage forwarding is a game changer
   * As other say repeatedly here. Konbinis are amazing. We are #teamfamilymart but Lawsons and 7-11 are also OK :)
   * Have the famichiki at Family Mart and come back here to thank me.
   * The coffee is amazing in Japan. Our favorite was a small shop called Chimney Coffee in Shibuya. If you have the chance go there. Generally we had excellent coffee everywhere. The exception was probably Hoshino coffee shop which is a chain and it is not very good. Please don‚Äôt go to Starbucks - there are so many better options just around the corner.
   * Google Maps vs Apple Maps. It felt to me that Google Maps was slightly better (even if I feel it is an app that is quite bloated). However, in some cases Apple Maps was much better. If one is not working for you, use the other.
   * It‚Äôs true that shopping is well worth it. Clothing but also anything else you need/want. I see that KitKat smiling at me. (it was the week before Halloween so there seemed to be a lot of new KitKat flavors).
   * Cash vs cards vs digital card. I found that digital cards (I use WISE lnked to Apple Pay) work 90% of the time. Some places require a physical card (or cash). EX: to top up the ICOCA card or to buy Shinkansen tickets you need a physical card. Some (few) only do cash but they usually have this well identified. I found this to be true mostly in Kyoto in some small shops in Gion but also in some food stalls in markets (like Tsujiki outer market or Nishiki market).
   * If you are an Apple user, create a shared photo album. We took so many pictures and it is nice to see everyone's pictures and relive memories. I'm sure android has something similar.

**Leaving**

   * So difficult to leave. Try not to cry and make sure you have memories.

1oi6dbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1oi6dbi/aeropress_common_guidelines/,Aeropress common guidelines,"Hello everyone,

I am relatively new to the world of Aeropress, and I may ask some silly questions. Apologies in advance.

I am finding myself using the same recipe no matter what i am brewing. 



But I wanted to ask if there are any general rules of thumb in the Aeropress world?

For example

How finely should you grind the beans in relation to how they are roasted

How long should the coffee brew in relation to how they are roasted

and so on :-) 



Do you have any guidelines? Links or anything else?

Use the above link to get ¬£50.00 when you switch energy providers!

I went with Octopus because:

- They are the cheapest electricity and gas supplier by far. I previously used Scottish Power and EDF.

- They offer saving sessions quite regularly where you get free electricity between certain hours. These are usually at the weekend and done during peak times!

- They have great customer service!

- Their app is easy to use and you get rewards like a weekly free coffee from Cafe Nero or Greggs.",1,1761649480.0,energy,0,1.0,False

1oi6au2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChartNavigators/comments/1oi6au2/the_morning_market_report/,The Morning Market Report,"TL;DR: 
SPY is trading at 684/682 with a cautious market tone. Amazon will lay off 30,000 employees, worrying retail and tech sectors. KDP is investing in coffee startups with Coffee .Co rollout. The US Department of Energy announces a $1B partnership with AMD, energizing semiconductor sentiment. PLTR is collaborating with Red Cat (RCAT), boosting AI and defense sector interest. President Trump announces new beef importing measures. BAH gets rated ‚Äúsell.‚Äù Upcoming earnings for SOFI, BKNG, and V will guide sector direction, as will FOMC data releases including Consumer Confidence and the Shiller Home Index. Sentiment poll: Bullish 38%, Neutral 28%, Bearish 34%




The [SPY ETF](https://flic.kr/p/2rBRYmT) is currently holding near 684 with support around 682, indicating a cautiously bullish stance as market participants digest a mixture of earnings, geopolitical developments, and economic data ahead. SPY is maintaining above its displaced moving averages with the Money Flow Index above 50, signaling positive cash inflows. The Directional Movement Index shows the +DI above the -DI, supported by a strong ADX reading that confirms upward trend strength.

Amazon announced plans to lay off 30,000 corporate employees starting October 28. This represents nearly 10% of its corporate workforce and follows prior cuts totaling about 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. The layoffs are part of CEO Andy Jassy‚Äôs efforts to reduce costs and restructure after pandemic-era expansion. The company did not comment officially, but these cuts are expected to impact multiple divisions including human resources, technology, devices, and operations. Amazon‚Äôs focus is shifting toward automation and AI, with plans to replace hundreds of thousands of roles over the next decade through technology. Seasonal hiring remains robust for the holiday period despite these corporate job cuts.

Keurig Dr Pepper is actively investing in coffee startups and rolling out its Coffee .Co brand, signaling innovation and growth initiatives in the beverage sector. The US Department of Energy recently announced a $1 billion partnership with AMD to advance energy and semiconductor technologies, supporting growth across the semiconductor industry and clean energy sectors.

Palantir is collaborating with Red Cat Holdings, enhancing its foothold in defense and AI analytics markets. President Trump has announced new beef import policies, which could impact agricultural supply chains and related sectors. Booz Allen Hamilton was downgraded to a sell rating, indicating caution in consulting and government services.

Earnings to watch include SoFi, Booking Holdings, and Visa. SoFi‚Äôs results will influence fintech sentiment as investors look for loan growth and user metrics. Booking Holdings will provide insight into travel sector demand through forward bookings and revenue guidance. Visa‚Äôs report will be key for understanding consumer spending trends and payment volumes.

The Federal Reserve is releasing updates on Consumer Confidence and the Shiller Home Price Index. These will provide critical data on household optimism and housing market conditions, influencing rates-sensitive sectors such as financials and real estate.


Sector rotation is favoring technology, semiconductors, and fintech as the strongest performers, driven by partnership announcements and innovation investments. On the other hand, sectors such as healthcare, materials, and certain consumer discretionary areas are lagging, presenting opportunities for defensive positioning. Risk management is key with volatility indices elevated, suggesting traders keep hedges ready and consider tactical dips in banking and semiconductor stocks like AMD.

We've launched a Survival Korean Course with 41 tasks like handling refunds, ordering coffee, or making reservations. Each task is broken into 3-4 subtasks, and the app tracks your subtasks completion and provides feedback as you go. It also generates grammar corrections for you.

If you get stuck or don't know how to complete a task, you can check the task editorial. Every task has one, and all editorials have been reviewed/edited/created by Korean tutors who are native speakers.

**How the app is different from generic AI language learning apps:**

1. **Task-based learning.** You're encouraged to produce the language rather than just passively memorizing vocabulary.
2. **Tutor-guided solutions.** All tasks have editorials reviewed/edited/created by Korean tutors, giving you a reliable learning resource.
3. **Progress tracking.** The app tracks task and subtask completion, so you have finite, achievable goals that help you build a habit (rather than endlessly chatting with an AI character).

The Survival Korean course is intended for beginner to intermediate learners, but we have a Business Korean course coming soon for intermediate and advanced learners.

The app is available as a website for now - mobile apps will come later. We recommend using it on a PC or laptop, but it works on mobile browsers as well.

**Link:** [https://www.nanotalk.app/](https://www.nanotalk.app/)

We'd love to hear your suggestions or feedback in the comments (like what kinds of tasks you'd like to see, etc.)! You can also send us feedback through the [contact form](https://nanotalk.notion.site/28e89aaddd3c80e797d3d4dd9cf91095?pvs=105)",3,1761649145.0,Korean,0,1.0,False

Im from the east coast of USA. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. I'm looking for any type of chats and either long term or short term. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately, too. I'm trying to see what the best tea and coffee out there. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. I bought a house recently and been turning it into a homestead.

I love learning new things/hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I have a whole room dedicated to the fish and tortoises. I have an outside enclosure i built them for the summer. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworl,  and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Love learning about people or hobbies they enjoy",1,1761649040.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1oi61y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1oi61y6/i_was_showing_the_same_ad_to_cold_traffic_and/,I Was Showing The Same Ad To Cold Traffic And Warm Leads (And It Killed My Conversion Rate) - Here's How I Fixed It,"My Meta ads were getting great engagement but terrible conversions.

Google was bringing clicks but not sales.

I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I realized something obvious that I'd completely missed:

***I was treating someone who'd never heard of me the same as someone who'd seen my ads 8 times.***

Same message. Same offer. Same landing page.

That's like proposing marriage on a first date.

**The Moment It Clicked**

I was looking at my Meta retargeting audiences and noticed something weird. My ""Website Visitors - Last 30 Days"" audience had people who visited once 29 days ago mixed with people who'd been back 6 times in the last week.

But I was showing them identical ads.

The person who visited once probably forgot I exist. The person who came back 6 times is clearly interested but hasn't pulled the trigger yet. They need completely different messages.

Then I checked my Google Ads and realized I was doing the same thing. Someone searching my brand name for the first time was seeing the same ad as someone who'd clicked my ad three times already.

That's when I built what I now call the ""Audience Maturity Ladder.""

**The Five Stages**

I mapped out how someone actually moves from stranger to customer, and what they need to hear at each stage:

***Stage 1 - ""Who are you?""*** (0-1 ad exposures) These people just discovered me. They don't know anything. They need context, not a sales pitch.

My old approach: ""Get 20% off now!"" My new approach: ""Here's why 12,000 people switched to our coffee grinder""

***Stage 2 - ""I have this problem""*** (2-3 exposures) They've seen me a couple times. They're aware they have a problem but don't know I'm the solution yet.

My old approach: Still pushing the discount My new approach: ""Spending $6/day at Starbucks? Here's the math on why that's costing you $2,190 per year""

***Stage 3 - ""You might solve this""*** (4-6 exposures) They're considering solutions now. They need to understand what makes me different.

My old approach: Generic product benefits My new approach: Side-by-side comparison showing my grinder vs the cheap Amazon ones, addressing specific objections

***Stage 4 - ""I'm deciding between you and competitors""*** (7-10 exposures) They're close. They're probably googling ""\[my brand\] vs \[competitor\]"" and reading reviews.

My old approach: Same 20% off offer everyone ignores My new approach: Real customer results, detailed specs, addressing the #1 objection (in my case: ""Is it really that much better than a $40 grinder?"")

***Stage 5 - ""Just need a reason to buy today""*** (11+ exposures) They've decided they want it. They're just waiting for the right moment or a small push.

My old approach: Constant discounts that trained people to wait My new approach: Scarcity that's actually real (limited stock alerts, free shipping ending dates), plus a modest discount

**How I Actually Track This**

The technical part was harder than I expected because Meta and Google don't naturally talk to each other.

I used a combination of Custom Audiences in Meta and Customer Match lists in Google. Every week, I export data from both platforms into a Google Sheet that counts total ad exposures per person.

The sheet assigns each person to a stage based on their combined exposure count across both platforms. Someone who clicked 2 Meta ads and 1 Google ad is Stage 2. Someone who clicked 5 Meta ads and 3 Google ads is Stage 4.

Then I have separate campaigns for each stage with completely different messaging.

In Meta, I use engagement-based audiences (video views, page visits) to estimate exposure. In Google, I use audience lists based on previous clicks and website behavior.

The key insight was realizing that someone who saw my Meta ad yesterday might Google me today. I needed to know their TOTAL exposure, not just what happened on one platform.

**What Changed?**

Before this, my overall conversion rate was 1.8% and I was spending about $6,400/month across both platforms at 3.2x ROAS.

After implementing the maturity ladder, my conversion rate hit 3.1% within 6 weeks. My ROAS went to 5.4x with the same ad spend.

But here's what really changed: my cost per acquisition dropped from $58 to $34 even though I was spending the same amount. I was just spending it smarter by showing people the right message at the right time.

The Stage 1 people (cold traffic) now get educational content that costs me $0.40 per engagement instead of trying to convert them immediately at $2.80 per click. Then when they move to Stage 4-5, they're pre-sold and convert at much higher rates.

My Google branded search campaign performance jumped because people arriving from Meta were already at Stage 3-4 instead of Stage 1. They knew what they wanted and just needed the final push.

**The Biggest Surprise...**

I expected Stage 5 (highest exposure) to convert best. And it did... but not by as much as I thought.

Stage 4 actually had the best ROAS (6.8x) because these people were actively comparing and I was answering their questions before they even asked. By Stage 5, some people had decided against me already - they'd just seen too many ads and gotten annoyed.

This taught me that there's a sweet spot. You can't just keep hammering people with more ads. There's a window where they're most ready, and if you miss it, you might actually push them away.

Now I have a rule: if someone hits 15+ exposures without converting, I exclude them for 60 days. Let them forget about me and reset. Saved me a bunch of wasted spend on people who clearly weren't going to buy.

**The Reality...**

Setting this up took me about two full days of work. The tracking spreadsheet alone took 6 hours because I'm not a data person and kept breaking the formulas.

But once it was running, the maintenance is maybe 30 minutes per week to update the audience exports and make sure people are being categorized correctly.

The hard part isn't the technical setup. It's actually creating 5 different message versions for each product and resisting the urge to just blast everyone with the same ""20% off"" ad.

**I built out the entire system - the exposure tracking spreadsheet, the message framework for each stage, the campaign structure for both platforms, and the weekly maintenance checklist.** It's basically everything I use to run this.

If you want it, drop a comment and I'll send it over.

a diet sounds like a good idea until you go to do it and remember how much it sucks.  i've lost weight before and i know you get used to it.  it's not the end of the world but there's a period at the beginning that isn't fun.  the problem with my eating is mostly portions, frequency and volume.  i keep decently healthy foods in the house so it's not like i have to overhaul all my groceries at least.  for the first time in a long while, i had a bowl of wheat bran today.  it's high in fiber and really low in calories but tastes like sawdust.  still, it's not bad with milk, raisins and some banana.  also, there's a recipe on the back of the bag for the best brain muffins i've ever had.  it's also very inexpensive.

a good trick for eating less is just to keep putting it off.  losing track of time is ideal.  eating less really makes food last, too.  i'm good for a while here and i'm remembering things i haven't eaten in a long time.  this '[cedar 6 item soup mix](https://www.foodbasics.ca/aisles/pantry/pasta-rice-beans/dried-beans/6-item-soup-mix/p/770338510433)' was a staple at one point.  i'm not sure how i want to do all this, but calories might only factor loosely, i don't want to get obsessive.  beans and lentils and even tofu (all of which i have on hand) are actually a bit calorie dense but i don't want to shy away just because of that.  

i thought i'd eat more today but i kept putting it off and now it's getting close to my 9:00 am bed time so i'm probably done.  i'm pretty sure i'll have time in the foreseeable future for a lazy recap here, a 'what i ate in the day' so why not.

Do you remember the good old days when purchasing furniture was a lifetime headache? When purchasing a fridge, it was signing a 15-year marriage contract, and apartment relocations required hiring a brigade of movers. Those times are quickly fading away, particularly for city dwellers who've learned something groundbreaking: you don't have to own all of it to live well.

Welcome to the age of rent, where [renting a washing machine ](https://www.payrentz.com/chennai/appliances/washing-machine-on-rent)or fridge is as common as subscribing to Netflix, and where city dwellers are choosing flexibility over ownership at every opportunity.

**The Urban Nomad's Dilemma**

Consider this: You're a 27-year-old professional who has got your dream job in Bengaluru. The company needs you on board in three weeks and you need to shift base from Mumbai. You have to identify a new apartment and furnish it fast. But the thought of buying products, relocating, and possibly selling everything all over again in two years fills your wallet cry and sends a pang of pain through your back just imagining it.

This is done thousands of times a day in all major cities. The new age working population is aspirational, more on the move, hopping across cities in search of greater opportunities, changing flats to shorten the traveling time, or just moving to better homes, without the hassle of baggage.

Step into the revolutionary solution: [furniture on rent](https://www.payrentz.com/chennai/furniture) and home appliances on rent have revolutionized what we perceive about urban dwelling.

**Why Ownership Became Overrated**

The old Indian home philosophy of ""buy it once, use it forever"" made perfect sense when families stayed rooted in one place for generations. That's no longer the case in today's fast moving urban life scenario. Young professionals now move every 2-3 years. Owning heavy and expensive furniture is more a hassle than a help.

Think about the numbers. A good sofa set ‚Çπ40,000? A good fridge for ‚Çπ25,000? And we have not even begun talking about washing machines, beds, dining tables, and other essentials. Add in moving costs, wear and tear, and resale headaches, and suddenly, buying doesn‚Äôt seem so smart.

Renting flips that equation. Need a fridge? Get a[ refrigerator on rent](https://www.payrentz.com/chennai/appliances/refrigerator-on-rent) for ‚Çπ800‚Äì1,200 a month instead of shelling out ‚Çπ25,000 upfront. The economic sense is obvious, but the advantages stretch far beyond figures.

**The Freedom Factor**

There‚Äôs real freedom in living light. When your furniture is rented, moving becomes an experience and not a logistical nightmare. No more haggling with packers over fragile pieces. No more sweating over whether your oversized sofa or dining table will fit through the new apartment door. And definitely no more stashing unused chairs and coffee tables at your parents‚Äô place ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù

Rental services usually take care of delivery, installation, maintenance, and pick-up. Your fridge and washing machine on rent include service warranties, i.e., when something goes wrong, your rental partner takes care of it and it‚Äôs definitely not your expense. Such comfort is especially suited to busy professionals who value time more than anything else.

**Sustainability Meets Style**

When appliances and furniture are shared among renters, there are fewer products that must be made. A single washing machine may be used by three different families during its lifespan, significantly lowering environmental impact than if everyone had their own.

The rental model also encourages companies to produce more durable, longer-lasting products because they need items that will be able to withstand many owners and relocations. This move from planned obsolescence to planned durability is a win-win for all. Renters receive better products, and the planet sees less trash.

And besides, rental services are always changing their inventory, so you can enjoy the latest designs and technologies without a splurge. That smart TV you've been coveting? You can rent it for a fraction of the cost and when a better model comes along, you can upgrade without the regret of an outdated, expensive purchase.

**The Flexibility Revolution**

City life requires adaptability, and rental services provide just that. New job thoughts and not sure of the location? Rent minimalist furniture until you find your footing. Hosting guests for a month? Bring in extra seating and [rent bed and mattress bedding](https://www.payrentz.com/chennai/furniture/mattress-on-rent) for a short while. Set to move overseas in two years? Live comfortably without worrying about disposing of valuable things later.

The rental model accommodates changes in life instead of restricting them. It's especially beneficial to young professionals, students, expatriates, and anybody going through life transition which describes most of us these days.

**Breaking the Status Quo**

The shift towards renting as a way of life is a wider transformation in the attitude towards possessions among younger generations. While previous generations identified success with asset amassing, today's urban professionals choose experiences, freedom of movement, and economic independence. They'd rather spend on traveling, education, or an entrepreneurial venture than on furnishing that won't be suitable for their lifestyle in the long run.

This attitude change is building a gigantic rental industry. Rental businesses are answering back with ever-more advanced offerings that include highly selected style packages, value flexibility, and frictionless digital experiences that make renting as effortless as online shopping.

**The Road Ahead**

As rental becomes more popular and its quality increases, the distinction between temporary and permanent residence solutions diminishes further. For most city residents, rental is not a transition to ownership. It's an intentional lifestyle option that provides greater freedom, less anxiety, and greater accommodation to contemporary city realities.

The future of city living isn't, in fact, about owning more; it's about accessing what you need, when you need it, without the hassle of committing. And honestly, from where I'm sitting, that future doesn't look promising; it looks pretty comfy.",1,1761648208.0,u_Outrageous_Court_629,0,1.0,False

My street has very high number of elderly neighbours. And most of them are really nice. In my previous apartment complex all of them except 1 was very nice. My son always gets pampered by these opa-omas with toys or cookies. Every time we knock on their doors they invite us for coffee-tea. They even return the garbage bins to other neighbours home as people are working in the daytime. I am wondering if this is common only in the south like Brabant Limburg or also in North or Randstad? My experience totally opposed the stereotypes that elderly are closed minded/ racist here. What is your experience?",8,1761647954.0,Netherlands,8,0.79,False

He did also talk (at least 2x) about redistricting, which he opposes. I didn't get those parts recorded, as my main objective wasn't to record but to learn for myself.

The question that led to this bit was either about what parts of the budget bill didn't he like, or directly about the shenanigans of replacing 3 members of IU's board with appointees by Gov. Braun.",21,1761647895.0,Indiana,5,0.92,False
1oi5vjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingWithMBC/comments/1oi5vjd/done_with_treatment/,Done with treatment,"Not exactly a vent but wanted to share my situation and hear comments, ideas, have you thought of....

So I've been MBC for just over five years now and they've been OK. Living relatively normal. 

Recently the cancer spread to my lungs and I have had really bad episodes of short of breath. I started on ENHURTU a few months ago, now that it is on the PBS in Australia. 
My oncologist and I had high hopes for this but it doesn't seem to be working.

It has knocked me around a lot, and overall I've been feeling like I am actually sick. 

I reviewed my 5 years of treatment and decided I've had enough. Im done with treatment. It's time to be kind to my body and myself from now on. 

I've been quite disciplined over the five years, eating well, exercising, trying different supplements, giving up coffee, chocolate etc. 

In reality I am pretty close to finishing treatment anyway because there is only one (new to Australia) treatment left anyway, as I have always maintained that I won't do standard chemo. 

So, at 65, after 5 years i am quite looking forward to no more blood tests, doctor appointments, researching all my mets, treatment etc. 

I've had a good life, in fact the last 5 years have been the best. Getting MBC coincided with getting sober from alcohol. 

I've only just made this decision and I am sharing it to hear other's thoughts. 

I realise this is an intensely personal choice and not for everyone. 

This group has been really valuable to me. ",14,1761647872.0,LivingWithMBC,2,0.94,False

I‚Äôm torn between the De‚ÄôLonghi Magnifica Evo Next (‚Ç¨549) and the Magnifica Plus (‚Ç¨719) ‚Äî both available here in Slovenia.

From what I‚Äôve learned:

- Plus has adjustable milk-foam density (3 levels) and a touchscreen, while the Evo Next doesn‚Äôt. (I indeed love the idea of adjustable milk-foam density)

- Plus also adds a few more drinks (about 15 vs 13) and a cold-drink mode (it‚Äôs not cold brew tho).

- Cleaning and build quality seem similar; Plus just feels more premium.

Tom from Tom‚Äôs Coffee Corner recommends the Plus, but that price gap is big.

I mostly drink espresso, latte, flat white, cappuccino (mostly milk-based drinks), and an occasional iced coffee/latte (I can live without iced coffee/latte option).

Do you think the Plus is worth paying ‚Ç¨170 more, or is the Evo Next already good enough? I feel like I would still go with the Plus but appreciate any real-world feedback! ",0,1761647869.0,superautomatic,1,0.5,False

1oi5rmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemonolatryPractices/comments/1oi5rmz/briefly_about_offerings/,Briefly about offerings,"**The essence of an offering is gratitude and respect.**

Therefore, an offering can be anything, as long as it meets the two points above.

**The most popular types of offerings are:**

**1) Physical.** This could be food/drinks, your creative work dedicated to the Spirit/Demon, stones, incense, etc. This includes anything you can touch and offer to the Spirit/Demon.

**2) Intangible.** This could be a promised action you promised. For example, going for a morning run, giving up bad habits, etc.

**3)** This is my personal type; some might find it unnecessary. **This is the Energy you expend on understanding the Spirit/Demon.** This could be searching for sources with descriptions, or analyzing someone else's experience to understand the Spirit/Demon, etc. It's the effort you give to learn and improve the connection.

While points 2 and 3 are self-explanatory, the first requires some precision.

If you leave food behind, it can spoil. In some practices, the very act of spoiling food is a sign that a Spirit/Demon/Deity has accepted the treat. In some practices, the very essence of ""giving food"" is important. That is, you simply offer the food, and then you can eat it and say, ""Spirit N, I hope you enjoyed this. I am eating this for you."" This isn't common in all practices, but it is done. Or you can throw it away, for example, for birds to eat or bury. There's a lot of room for imagination here. It's the same with drinks.

**Now let's talk about the most controversial topic: blood offerings.** I don't see anything good or bad about it. But I'll explain. The essence of an offering is gratitude and respect. The essence of a blood offering is empowerment and a sign of the highest trust. Let me explain: what is blood? It's what keeps us alive. Blood renews itself, which symbolically signifies life force. And when you give blood as an offering, you give part of your life force. It's an act of the highest trust and responsibility. It can either enhance or detract from your work, so you need to be extremely careful.

**Basics:** If you can't find the right stones, herbs, incense, or candles for a specific Spirit/Demon, you can offer whatever you like and have available to you. Example: I really love coffee; I am coffee; coffee is me. When I drink coffee and I'm in the mood, I share my coffee and offer it as an offering.

**Also, here in this sub, there's a discussion thread on ""gratitude to the Spirits."" Public praise is also an offering to some extent.** 

If I missed anything, please point it out in the comments. Also, let me know your thoughts.",3,1761647499.0,DemonolatryPractices,0,1.0,False

TOKYO ‚Äî Weapons sales and trade in critical minerals were on the agenda when President Donald Trump met new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in the Japanese capital Tuesday morning. Trump arrived Monday after a stop in Malaysia for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.

He and Takaichi met in an ornate conference room at Akasaka Palace, a state guest house, alongside top leaders from their governments. Just outside were parked gleaming new American and Japanese pickup trucks. The Japanese government is considering the purchase of a fleet of Ford F-150s. ‚ÄúShe has good taste,‚Äù Trump, referring to Takaichi, told reporters on Air Force One during the flight to Asia. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hot truck.‚Äù

Trump and Takaichi met elsewhere in the palace to sign a new agreement strengthening their alliance and a framework for securing a U.S. supply of critical minerals and rare earths ‚Äî key materials for the defense and technology industries.  
Takaichi kicked off the meeting by thanking Trump for his enduring friendship of Shinzo Abe, the late Japanese prime minister whom, she said, told her about the U.S. leader‚Äôs dynamic diplomacy.

Takaichi served as a cabinet minister under Abe and is regarded as his prot ‚ÄúShinzo Abe was a great friend of mine,‚Äù Trump replied, adding that he was saddened and shocked by his friend‚Äôs death. Abe was assassinated in July 2022.

Takaichi praised Trump‚Äôs recent peacemaking efforts in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. She noted the United States‚Äô upcoming 250th anniversary and said Japan would send 250 cherry trees to Washington, D.C. Fireworks from Japan‚Äôs Akita prefecture would be sent there for next year‚Äôs July Fourth celebration, she added.

Takaichi told Trump she would continue to strive to strengthen Japan‚Äôs national power ‚Äî namely diplomacy, defense capability, economic power, technology, intelligence and human resources. Since 2022, Japan has been growing its defense budget to 2% of gross domestic product and developing a counterstrike capability with long-range missiles. Tokyo faces a rapid military buildup by China, which routinely challenges Japan‚Äôs hold on territory in the East China Sea and demonstrates its ability to invade Taiwan.

Trump said the U.S. has received orders from Japan for a large amount of military equipment and noted that America makes the best equipment, including jets and missiles. ‚ÄúHopefully we don‚Äôt ever have to use them very much, if at all,‚Äù he said. Trump flies on Wednesday to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and a sideline meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump added that he has always had great love and respect for Japan.

**‚ÄúThis will be a relationship that will be stronger than ever before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are an ally at the strongest level.‚Äù Trump said Takaichi will be one of the great prime ministers and congratulated her on being Japan‚Äôs first female prime minister. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a big deal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are going to have a fantastic relationship.‚Äù**

# Oct. 28th, 2025~Trade deal or no trade deal, China still holds crucial minerals leverage over U.S.

*Framework deal announced days before Trump, Xi intend to meet in South Korea ‚Äî but truce looks shaky*

[Trade deal or no trade deal, China still holds crucial minerals leverage over U.S. | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-xi-us-china-apec-meeting-9.6955385)

[U.S. President Donald Trump, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Thursday's meeting between the leaders in South Korea will be the first of Trump‚Äôs second term. \(Saul Martinez, Amilcar Orfali\/Getty Images\)](https://preview.redd.it/kf3kz3njrtxf1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=78971579b39adf0b0bd6d45c69adf499b5828a94)

China still has substantial leverage over the U.S. in its dominance of the rare earth minerals market, despite the two countries agreeing to a framework trade deal days before a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The meeting between the leaders, the first of Trump‚Äôs second term, is set to happen Thursday on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.

It comes as the world‚Äôs two largest economies are embroiled in a trade war that has seen the countries levy tariffs higher than 100 per cent, threatening to rock the global economy ‚Äî and revealing that China is willing to use its strengths as bargaining chips in the face of increasing economic threats from the White House.¬†

# New framework deal¬†

There was, however, optimism that tariffs would be averted just days before Trump and Xi are slated to meet, after top officials from both countries announced a potential trade agreement following months of talks between officials,¬†[including in Geneva in May](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-china-tariff-talks-1.7532228)¬†and Madrid in September.

‚ÄúThe tariffs will be averted,‚Äù stated¬†U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who, alongside U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Kuala Lumpur¬†[announced a ‚Äúsubstantial framework‚Äù](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bessent-says-us-china-reach-framework-deal-rare-earths-trumps-tariff-threat-nbc-2025-10-26/)¬†for Xi and Trump‚Äôs meeting.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to have a deal with China,‚Äù Trump said later.

However, the truce continues to be tenuous, considering the ebbs and flows of the U.S.-China relationship.

‚ÄúThere is a ceasefire going on. It doesn't mean there's disarmament,‚Äù said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C.¬†

‚ÄúThese tools will still be available to both sides,"" she said, referring to¬†tariffs and using various domestic industries as leverage.

Although the details are still murky, Bessent said the agreement included¬†[a ‚Äúfinal deal‚Äù to transfer TikTok‚Äôs U.S operations to new ownership](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-china-tiktok-deal-1.7635620)¬†or face a ban, something Trump has delayed several times.¬†

Bessent also said China could¬†[resume buying soy beans](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-soybean-farmers-deserted-by-big-buyer-china-scramble-other-importers-2025-10-03/)¬†from U.S. farmers after Chinese orders¬†[stopped completely in the trade war](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-imports-no-us-soybeans-september-first-time-seven-years-2025-10-20/).¬†

He suggested¬†[the 100 per cent tariff on Chinese imports Trump threatened](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-more-tariffs-china-market-reaction-9.6934975)¬†would not take effect Nov. 1.¬†

But perhaps most importantly, the deal would see¬†[China delay its export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ustr-greer-says-trade-talks-with-china-moving-toward-agreement-leaders-review-2025-10-26/)¬†on rare earth minerals for a year ‚Äî a major pain point for Washington.

For some watchers, the agreement signals an important acknowledgement of the consequences of a blowout.¬†

‚ÄúIt has become increasingly evident that the two top leaders continue to share a pragmatic desire to stabilize the world‚Äôs most consequential bilateral relationship,‚Äù said Beijing-based Zichen Wang, research fellow at the non-government think-tank Centre for China and Globalization.

He calls¬†that desire¬†a ‚Äúvital safety valve amid deep structural rivalry.‚Äù

# 'Room for mischief'

The agreement strikes a careful balance, says Jonathan Czin, the Michael H. Armacost Chair in foreign policy studies at the non-profit Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C.¬†

‚ÄúIt allows both sides to declare victory or enough victory in the run-up to the meeting that you can justify a presidential encounter,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also enough ambiguity that leaves room for mischief and further measures.‚Äù¬†

* [As Trump moves to withdraw from global commitments, China is waiting in the wings](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-us-china-relations-climate-health-1.7438632)

Many outstanding issues remain and likely won‚Äôt be tackled by Trump and Xi when they meet.¬†

They include trade imbalances,¬†[China‚Äôs overcapacity](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-the-us-should-address-chinese-overcapacity-and-its-impact-on-international-trade/), security in the¬†[South China Sea](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2015/07/americas-security-role-in-the-south-china-sea?lang=en)¬†and¬†[competition in technology](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/02/strategic-imperatives-in-the-us-china-technology-race.html).

‚ÄúI don't think the U.S. has had the capacity and the bandwidth to negotiate a huge deal with China,‚Äù said Rorry Daniels, managing director of the New York-based Asia Society Policy Institute, adding that deals on ""smaller"" issues might be more likely.

‚ÄúThese are two countries that remain deeply mistrustful of each other,‚Äù she said.

# ‚ÄòA very strong leader‚Äô

Speculation about a potential face-to-face meeting between the two presidents heightened after Xi formally invited Trump to China during a phone call in June, then again in September.¬†

Unlike his predecessors and the hawks in his administration, the U.S. president has repeatedly flattered his counterpart.

""I get along great with \[Xi\],‚Äù Trump said on¬†*Sunday Morning Futures*¬†on Fox News on Oct 19. ‚ÄúHe's a very strong leader.‚Äù¬†

The last several weeks and months are telling of the current state of the relationship and just how strong a position Xi is in as the two gear up for their meeting.

Early on in Trump's trade war, China was one of the few countries to threaten retaliatory tariffs ‚Äî an indicator it thought¬†its economy could withstand the pain.¬†

# Rare earth mineral exports¬†

More recently, on Oct. 9, China¬†[expanded its export rules on rare earth minerals](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html)¬†after months of relative calm in the trade war truce.

Not only did the country threaten to restrict exports, but it also said it would require foreign companies to apply for a licence from the Chinese government to ship magnets with even a trace of rare earths from China or those obtained using Chinese equipment or technology.

‚ÄúXi knew that doing this could have potentially jeopardized the \[Trump-Xi\] meeting, and it's very telling that he was willing to take that risk,‚Äù said Czin with the Brookings Institute.¬†

That's possible because Beijing has a near-monopoly on the minerals, which are essential to everything from smartphones to medical devices, fighter jets and electric vehicles.¬†

China currently controls roughly 70 per cent of mining and 90 per cent of the processing of these minerals,¬†[according to Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts), and the U.S. is just one of many countries heavily reliant on them.¬†

‚Äú\[China\] utilizing its unique advantages in the global supply chain seems to have worked very well,‚Äù said Wang with the Centre for China and Globalization.¬†

In response to the measures, Trump threatened an additional 100 per cent surtax on Chinese goods and export controls on software. He later admitted the tariff was ""not sustainable"" in an interview with Fox Business Network.¬†¬†

What‚Äôs also telling is attempts by the U.S. administration to play catch up with China‚Äôs dominance in the field.

On his whirlwind Asia tour, Trump signed two agreements with newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, one of which focused on critical minerals mining and processing. According to the framework provided by the White House, the deal includes working together to ""accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals and rare earths ... by leveraging policy tools"" including ""financial support mechanisms"" and ""trade measures.""

On Sept. 8, U.S. Strategic Metals signed¬†[a $500 million agreement¬†](https://pk.usembassy.gov/u-s-strategic-metals-signs-mou-on-critical-minerals-in-pakistan/)with the Pakistani military‚Äôs Frontier Works Organization, that country‚Äôs largest miner of critical minerals.¬†

Earlier this month, Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese¬†[signed an agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/10/united-states-australia-framework-for-securing-of-supply-in-the-mining-and-processing-of-critical-minerals-and-rare-earths/)¬†to invest $8.5 billion to boost rare earth and critical minerals supplies by expanding mining and processing.¬†

However, that work is often measured in decades.¬†

# 'When the elephants fight'

A sense of the leaders‚Äô positions heading into a meeting can also be gauged from their respective domestic politics.

Despite¬†[a slumping economy at home](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-q3-gdp-growth-slows-lowest-year-backs-calls-more-stimulus-2025-10-20/), Xi has just hosted the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs annual plenum, where it vowed¬†[to speed up the country‚Äôs self-reliance](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202510/23/content_WS68f9f337c6d00ca5f9a06fb2.html)¬†in technology. During the four-day meeting, he highlighted his power by¬†[purging high-ranking members of the military](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/veteran-military-leader-zhang-shengmin-promoted-chinas-number-two-general-2025-10-23/).

Trump, meanwhile, is heading to South Korea as the U.S. government potentially faces its¬†[longest-ever shutdown](https://www.whitehouse.gov/government-shutdown-clock/).¬†

Ultimately, there are billions of dollars riding on Trump and Xi working it out.

‚ÄúMost countries don‚Äôt want to see China and the United States fight one another because \[they are\] the two largest economies and militaries in the world,‚Äù said Wang.¬†

‚ÄúWhen the elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.‚Äù¬†

[Lockheed Says It‚Äôs Self-Funding Prototypes. Could a ‚ÄòFerrari‚Äô F-35 Be One? | Air & Space Forces Magazine](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/lockheed-self-funding-prototypes-f-35/)

[An F-35A, in flight above the Mojave Desert in California, January 6, 2023.](https://preview.redd.it/hy9jul2iutxf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e176eaad59c3ca51cd0545ee4acd08c32e6bb8)

Lockheed Martin is taking a ‚Äúhome run‚Äù approach to self-funded research and development by building full prototypes to show to the U.S. government, CEO Jim Taiclet said Oct. 20‚Äîa plan he hinted could apply to technology the company is hoping to shift to the F-35 from its rejected Next-Generation Air Dominance fighter.

Over the past five years, Taiclet told reporters on an earnings call, Lockheed has shifted its approach on so-called independent R&D to focus more on ‚Äúbig-bet, home-run heavy allocation ‚Ä¶ where we are actually building prototype vehicles to demonstrate to the government, perhaps alongside the new entrants, where we can show them a working vehicle that we can produce at scale, that they can rely on.‚Äù

As examples, he cited space-based interceptors‚Äîthe firm is planning a demonstration in 2028‚Äîand a¬†[new autonomous Black Hawk helicopter](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/could-modified-pave-hawks-help-the-air-force-support-agile-combat-employment/)‚Äîunveiled last week.

Of particular note for the Air Force, he also indicated Lockheed and its advanced projects Skunk Works division plans to invest in ‚Äúthis notion of sixth-generation technology insertion into the F-35 and F-22.‚Äú

‚ÄúHow do we take the Skunk Works activities that were designed to go into NGAD and other potential opportunities, some of which are classified, but we developed these sixth-generation capabilities, whether it‚Äôs stealth, propulsion, inlet designs, coatings, those kinds of things in ‚Ä¶ Skunk Works, which we can actually backward integrate into F-35 and F-22, and are doing so,‚Äù Taiclet said.

Taiclet has raised the idea before, saying in April that Lockheed could add new NGAD-derived capabilities to the F-35 that would c[reate a fighter with 80 percent of the NGAD‚Äôs capability at 50 percent of its cost.](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/lockheed-not-protest-ngad-award/)¬†He referred to the concept at the time as a ‚ÄúFerrari F-35.‚Äù

A Lockheed spokesperson declined to say specifically whether Taiclet meant to say that the company is working on its own tricked-out F-35. Instead, they said he was referencing technologies ‚Äúbroadly.‚Äù  
In addition to the projects Taiclet mentioned,¬†[Lockheed has also introduced](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/vectis-lockheed-skunk-works-cca/)¬†its concept for a fighter escort drone called Vectis‚Äîsimilar to the Air Force‚Äôs Collaborative Combat Aircraft program, but not specifically targeted for it, officials said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to keep answering \[requests for proposals and requests for information\] in the traditional way,‚Äù Taiclet said. ‚ÄúBut we are now in the business of self-funding prototypes at the corporate level, with which we can actually demonstrate real capability leapfrogs to our customers.‚Äù

Lockheed CFO Evan Scott said the company ended the quarter with a backlog of 265 F-35s, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs before adding the extra 151 that came in the first week‚Äù of the quarter, when the company and the Joint Program Office¬†[finalized the Lot 18 and 19 contracts](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-35-lots-18-and-19-contract/). He said the company has confidence, given steady production and strong support from both Congress and the White House that Lockheed‚Äôs goal of an average rate of 156 jets per year is sustainable.

‚ÄúAs we really hit a good groove on production ‚Ä¶that will continue to translate into operational results,‚Äù Scott said. But the biggest growth driver in F-35 will be from sustainment, as the number of aircraft in the field continues to increase, he said. This year, production of F-35s will fall between 175 and 190 airplanes, and there will be ‚Äúa big focus on completing Block 4 development,‚Äù he said.

Taiclet said earlier this year¬†[that he believes testing for the Technology Refresh 3 upgrade‚Äîon which the Block 4 improvements depend‚Äîis largely complete](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/lockheed-believes-it-has-finished-f-35-tr-3-upgrade-executive-says/#:~:text=Lockheed%20believes%20it%20has%20finished%20F%2D35%20TR%2D3,remains%20to%20be%20validated%20by%20the%20US).

‚ÄúWe have the best collaboration we‚Äôve ever had and openness with the government,‚Äù Taiclet said. Collaboration with RTX, which provides the F-35 distributed aperture system; BAE Systems, the electronic warfare subcontractor; and Northrop Grumman, which makes the F-35 center fuselage and its radar, is at peak levels, and government is working to ‚Äúremove barriers and delays ‚Ä¶ which heretofore hadn‚Äôt been addressed that aggressively.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a positive conversation with all the parties that are involved in this Block 4 modernization program, which is really, really important to keep everything on time, to keep the production line going. So I‚Äôm confident that we will have a successful Block 4 rollout,‚Äù Taiclet said.

He added that the upgrade is ‚Äúsuper challenging, by the way; some of the technologies that are coming on to the jet and having to be integrated are complex, but I do think that it‚Äôs just going to make the aircraft even more dominant than ever before. And you know, any ex-pilot or current pilot can tell you, if you‚Äôve got the best EW, the best sensor suite and the best weapons and the best radar, you‚Äôre going to win, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre out for.‚Äù

Taiclet said 46 F-35s were delivered in the third quarter, and that the rate of deliveries is now ‚Äúessentially one aircraft delivery every working day of the year.‚Äù Some 1,200 F-35s have been delivered to all users since the program‚Äôs inception, he said, and they have amassed more than 1 million flight hours.

‚ÄúOver the years to come, the U.S. and 19 international allies will continue to progress toward a planned global fleet of over 3,500 aircraft‚Äù Taiclet said.

Scott said that Belgium has signaled it wants to buy a further 11 F-35s and Denmark an additional 16 aircraft to bolster their fleets.

Taiclet and Scott also said that there are no further charges on a¬†[classified aeronautics program on which the company took a $950 million loss in the second quarter](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/secret-lockheed-program-lose-1-billion/), and Taiclet said those actions were made to clear the decks and ensure¬†the fixed-price program is healthy going forward. ¬†

In the second quarter call, Taiclet called the effort ‚Äúa highly classified program that can only be described as a game-changing capability for our joint U.S. and international customers, and therefore it is critical that it be successfully fielded.‚Äù¬† With the ‚Äúrapid incorporation of lessons learned,‚Äù Taiclet said Lockheed will reduce risk on the effort ‚Äúas we move through the key milestones of this very advanced system.‚Äù He has also described the project as a future ‚Äúfranchise‚Äù for Lockheed.

On the third quarter call, Taiclet said the company has explored ‚Äúevery single assumption in that bid from 2018‚Äù to find improvement, ‚Äúand we think we‚Äôve covered most of the bases. ‚Ä¶ But there‚Äôs still technical risk in this, and what will come out the other side is something really amazing that will have lots more demand, we think, beyond the fixed price production lots that we are taking the charges for.‚Äù

He added that ‚ÄúI do see a much more robust future for that program now that we‚Äôve taken those charges. Again, \[we\] put¬†that all behind us. But it‚Äôs not 100 percent risk free, let‚Äôs say. But I think, in the end, all in all, and I‚Äôve been on top of all these programs myself too, at a detailed level, this will be very good for the company and very good for the country.‚Äù

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek‚Äôs mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# üîë The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)**¬†‚Äì The¬†*quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion ‚Äî potentially all ‚Äî of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl‚ÇÑ)**¬†‚Äì Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl‚ÇÑ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)**¬†‚Äì¬†*The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)**¬†‚Äì The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships.¬†*Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ‚ö° Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance**¬†‚Üí Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition**¬†‚Üí Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts**¬†‚Üí 2025 drilling added¬†**9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)**¬†plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October¬†could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

# America‚Äôs Scandium Era Has Begun ‚Äî And NioCorp Is Holding the Only Winning Hand

**IMHO- NioCorp just delivered its most bullish update in years ‚Äî and the market hasn‚Äôt even priced it in yet.** Lockheed Martin is actively developing a defense application that *requires* scandium, and the DoD wants deployment in **18‚Äì24 months**. Elk Creek will produce **3‚Äì4√ó current global Sc supply**, instantly making Nebraska the #1 strategic source for a metal the Pentagon literally can‚Äôt get enough of. This isn‚Äôt hype ‚Äî **DPA Title III funding is already hitting NioCorp‚Äôs bank account**, meaning U.S. defense dollars are now officially backing Elk Creek.

**Construction is finally looking imminent.** The mine plan is locked, land secured, and capital already being deployed ‚Äî with site clearing and the **twin decline portal** expected to lead early visible build-out. The drilling campaign ‚Äî completed Oct. 9 ‚Äî is coming back with **excellent core and rock mechanics**, expected to **upgrade measured resources** and expand the mine plan. We‚Äôre now entering the economics phase ‚Üí assay results ‚Üí resource update ‚Üí **updated Feasibility Study this quarter**.

**Financing is lining up on multiple fronts** to avoid harsh dilution: EXIM Bank (\~$380M), UKEF (\~$200M), and a German ECA (\~$200M) are progressing collaboratively toward a **65/35 debt-equity** structure. Management made it clear: **every product has active offtake discussions**, and defense urgency is accelerating timelines. The company believes scandium + niobium adoption curves are entering a **demand shock** phase driven by hypersonics, directed energy, and data-center magnetics.

Bottom line: **Elk Creek is now a U.S. national security priority** with catalysts stacking up in the next 3‚Äì6 months ‚Äî updated FS, drilling upgrade, new offtakes, and transformational sovereign financing. Shorts are sitting on **11M+ shares** into the biggest news cycle in NioCorp‚Äôs history. If you think defense primes and the U.S. government are going to stand by and let strategic metals slip away? **Not in this geopolitical environment.**

# NioCorp, IBC, Lockheed Martin, and the Pentagon have just lit the scandium fuse ‚Äî uniting mine, metal, and mission into a DFARS-forged U.S. defense lattice, the modern echo of titanium‚Äôs 1950s ignition.

# Sc + Nb + Ti + REEs ‚Üí U.S. Aerospace & Hypersonic Sovereignty

Coffee after coffee to push through, cigarettes to ""take the edge off,"" and a never-ending list of things I needed to do for everyone‚Äîexcept me.‚Äã

So I made myself one promise I couldn't break: 20 minutes a day, just for me. No negotiating, no guilt, no rescheduling.‚Äã

I didn't start with some grand plan or unrealistic goals. Just a quick walk and some basic bodyweight stuff‚Äîpush-ups, squats, nothing fancy. The weird thing? The first changes weren't physical. My head felt clearer, I slept better, and my mood evened out way before I saw anything different in the mirror.‚Äã

I cut myself down to two cups of coffee in the morning, and when that first cigarette craving hit, I'd go for a short walk or do a quick circuit with light weights instead. Slowly, the pull of the habit started to weaken.‚Äã

I also learned to say something that saved my sanity: ""Yes‚Äîbut after my hour."" Not rude, just honest. It's how I stayed present for the people I care about without completely burning out by the end of the day.‚Äã

My routine stayed simple: 5-minute warm-up, 10 minutes of the basics with tiny weekly improvements, then 5 minutes to cool down with a walk. I stopped drinking caffeine after noon so my sleep wouldn't suffer, and I focused on just being consistent‚Äînot perfect.‚Äã

I aimed for 4‚Äì5 days a week. That was it. No heroics, just showing up. And honestly, each week I felt a little lighter‚Äînot just physically, but like hope was something I could actually hold onto again.‚Äã

Movement became my daily reset. It eased the tightness in my chest, brought my thoughts back into focus, and reminded me that I get to own a piece of my day before it's swallowed up by everything else.‚Äã

**So I'm curious:**¬†If you're in your forties (or older) and trying to slowly quit, cut back on caffeine, and still be there for your family‚Äîhow did you find your balance without wrecking your joints or your sleep?‚Äã

And what's the smallest thing that actually made a difference for you mentally, not just physically? Was it 15 minutes of walking? A few basic lifts? Some tiny ritual you kept even when life got loud?‚Äã

Would love to hear what worked for you.",3,1761647478.0,workout,3,0.8,False

1oi5qiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1oi5qiq/our_2_week_debrief_focused_on_practicalities/,Our 2 week debrief - focused on practicalities rather than what to do,"Hi all, we just returned from a 2-week trip and wanted to share back to this group our experience. This is more focused on practicalities rather than what to do or see (although there is a bit of that as well)

¬†**Itinerary**

Our travel and stay was more or less like this. Sometimes we departed a location in the morning and other times in the afternoon so take the days in each location with a pinch of salt.

Osaka (2 days) ‚Äì Kyoto (3 days) ‚Äì Tokyo (4 days) ‚Äì Kawaguchiko (Mt. Fuji) (2 days) ‚Äì Osaka (2 days)

We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids aged 10 and 15). We don‚Äôt generally allow the kids to take their devices on family vacations although they took their phones this time so they could take pictures but we didn‚Äôt enable cellular on their phones (why this matters later).

¬†**Arriving**

* eSim
   * We setup our eSIM card the day before. We used Ubigi. I got a 10GB package for me and for my wife. I activated mine first and got a referral coupon which we applied to my wife‚Äôs data package so she got a 20% discount.
   * When she activated hers, I got another coupon for 50% discount. This could‚Äôve been useful in case we needed to top-up but we didn‚Äôt need to.10GB was more than enough for the 2 weeks. We used google maps, apple maps, whatsapp (to send photos to family and friends), safari, and some posting of IG stories but neither I nor my wife are heavy social media consumers. Your mileage may vary.
* IC cards
   * We landed in Osaka so we got the ICOCA card. We had to go to the ticket office because my daughter is 10 years and we needed to show proof of age ‚Äì she got a discounted ICOCA with her name ‚Äì we kept it as a souvenir. ICOCA worked in all of our locations.
   * Since the kids didn‚Äôt have their devices connected, we all got physical ICOCA cards. I don‚Äôt know if you need connectivity on the device to use the IC card so we went ‚Äúold school‚Äù. It was perfect.
   * Nankai Rapi:t Express got us from KIX to Namba in 40 mins ‚Äì easy but do note that the ICOCA does not work on this line. You need to buy tickets

¬†**During**

* Osaka:
   * both times we stayed close to Dotonbori. Super easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. A really nice area with a great vibe.
   * The day after we arrived we visited the Expo. It was the last day of the Expo. After reading here that we should avoid it, I am glad we went. The atmosphere was amazing and the pavilions we visited were all super nice.
* Kyoto:
   * I wish we had one more day. Kyoto is VERY crowded with tourists. We stayed in an AirBnB just below the main station and it is a nice neighborhood with some hidden gems for food/dinner.
   * Gion was too crowded but still nice.
   * When we visited the Bamboo forest it was not overly crowded but inside there is Okochi sanso garden. Because you need to pay an extra ticket to get it, it was empty and very quiet and so beautiful. This was amazing for us. (there is even a rest area where you can have a free cup of tea or Calpis).
   * The day before we left to Tokyo we went to Nishiki market. It was probably my favourite market in Japan.
* Tokyo ‚Äì What to say about Tokyo?
   * Amazing. The city, the parks, getting lost, finding our way‚Ä¶ just go and enjoy it. Something we did that I haven‚Äôt seen too much on here was a Cooking class. We took a morning class and cooked Gyozas and Ramen. Super cool and the kids loved it.
   * I have a college friend in Tokyo that I hadn‚Äôt seen in 20 years so managed to meet with him and he gave us a lot of tips as a local person. This was a highlight. The kids actually thought dad is a cool guy. This sentiment lasted a full day.
   * Some advice I read here is to stay away from Shibuya and Shinjuku for accommodation as it is too crowded. This is true but we stayed in Shibuya and it was awesome for us. Shinjuku would‚Äôve worked as well to be honest. We just found the hotel in Shibuya first. We visited Asakusa and many people here recommend staying there. I would not but that is a personal choice (I thought Senso-ji¬†temple was more hype than anything else).
   * The subway lines seem complicated but if know your colors and can recognize the letters JA, JY, JR, etc. it is simple and straightforward. My 15 year old son was navigating the subway like an expert after 1 day.
* Fujikawaguchiko:
   * the first day it was cloudy and some rain so we couldn‚Äôt see Mt. Fuji but we made the best of it. There is a craft shop where you can just go and we felt like locals. The kids made some candles and they have a really nice souvenir. It was nice to slow down and observe the Japanese art of discipline if that makes any sense at all. It was very peaceful.
   * Second day it was sunny and we saw Mt. Fuji and explored the area. There is a bus system (red, green, etc.) that is also easy to navigate. If you know your colors this should also be easy.
   * The food here seems to be very much around barbecuing. There is a staple which is chicken cutlet that you finish off the cooking at the table. It‚Äôs good, trust me.
   * We went back to Osaka (since we were departing from KIX). We took a bus to Mishima and then the Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka. We bought the bus ticket the day we arrived so we could secure our schedule but the Shinkansen tickets we bought when we arrived at Mishima and it was fine. It was a longer internal travel day. Perhaps a better choice would've been to plan the Mt. Fuji trip in between the Tokyo stay. We live and learn.¬†
* Random notes:
   * We used the subway and train lines except twice. In Kyoto the buses were super crowded and packed so after a long day we decided to take a taxi back to the AirBnB. The second time was on our departure day from Osaka to KIX. We could‚Äôve used the luggage forwarding service to send the luggage straight to KIX but decided not to because timings were tight.
   * All hotels and the Kyoto AirBnB had strong wifi
   * Luggage forwarding is a game changer
   * As other say repeatedly here. Konbinis are amazing. We are #teamfamilymart but Lawsons and 7-11 are also OK :)
   * Have the famichiki at Family Mart and come back here to thank me.
   * The coffee is amazing in Japan. Our favorite was a small shop called Chimney Coffee in Shibuya. If you have the chance go there. Generally we had excellent coffee everywhere. The exception was probably Hoshino coffee shop which is a chain and it is not very good. Please don‚Äôt go to Starbucks - there are so many better options just around the corner.
   * Google Maps vs Apple Maps. It felt to me that Google Maps was slightly better (even if I feel it is an app that is quite bloated). However, in some cases Apple Maps was much better. If one is not working for you, use the other.
   * It‚Äôs true that shopping is well worth it. Clothing but also anything else you need/want. I see that KitKat smiling at me. (it was the week before Halloween so there seemed to be a lot of new KitKat flavors).
   * Cash vs cards vs digital card. I found that digital cards (I use WISE lnked to Apple Pay) work 90% of the time. Some places require a physical card (or cash). EX: to top up the ICOCA card or to buy Shinkansen tickets you need a physical card. Some (few) only do cash but they usually have this well identified. I found this to be true mostly in Kyoto in some small shops in Gion but also in some food stalls in markets (like Tsujiki outer market or Nishiki market). 
   * If you are an Apple user, create a shared photo album. We took so many pictures and it is nice to see everyone's pictures and relive memories. I'm sure android has something similar.

¬†**Leaving**

So difficult to leave. Try not to cry and make sure you have memories.

  


I‚Äôm sure I am missing some practicalities that might be useful to you. Feel free to ask and I will try to answer if I know.",3,1761647391.0,JapanTravel,2,1.0,False
