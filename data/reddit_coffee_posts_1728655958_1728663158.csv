1g1dh51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g1dh51/question_for_people_with_experience_using/,QUESTION FOR PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE USING METHYLPHENIDATE,"Hey, for about 2.5 months I've been taking Medikinet CR 30 mg (and until recently it worked very well, 7.5/10, and the first 2 weeks it was probably 9.5/10 - a lot of calm, better concentration, motivation, ease in completing tasks, optimism). For the past 2 weeks, there's been a decline. Fatigue, rapid heartbeat, stress, exhaustion, and increased lack of appetite have returned. And while I feel quite good mentally, my body feels exhausted and I‚Äôm held back by physical symptoms like the mentioned heartbeat, feeling as if I've had too much coffee, overstimulation, and a severe lack of appetite. What's strange is that the later it gets, the better I feel; I‚Äôm calmer and my body isn't freaking out - I‚Äôm wondering if I react better to the second dose of the medication, the slow-release part, and if it‚Äôs possible to only use this second form? At the very beginning, I was taking Medikinet even on an empty stomach and then eating something later, and it was fine, but apparently that's not recommended, so I thought it might be the reason. I started eating breakfast, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller, and there's no effect. üôÅ I'm going to see my psychiatrist next week and I‚Äôd like to ask about your experience and opinions on what you would suggest in this situation. Increase the dose? Decrease it? Switch to another medication with the same substance? Try non-stimulants? I know everyone reacts differently, but I guess I just need to talk it out and listen to others, and sometimes you have good insights, and small changes can improve the medication‚Äôs effectiveness. If anyone wants to chat in private about this, let me know, and I'll get back to you.",1,1728663082.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

He complimented me, said he doesn't know what he's looking for, just ""pleasant guys,"" and offered to let me crash at his place and show me his suburb since I hadn‚Äôt booked accommodation yet. 

We met, kissed passionately, and he was really affectionate, almost like we were already dating. He showed me around the city, even gave me the keys for his little flat. When I asked why he was being so extremely affectionate (kissing me everywhere, hugging, holding my hand at every opportunity) he hesitated and said it‚Äôs just his personality. 
After I got bad news about being dropped from uni for missing 0,5 point, he consoled me and made me laugh. I stayed for two nights. He said he wants updates on my situation and even suggested I could continue study in his country, but I‚Äôm unsure how sincere he was. 

I went to another city but had to come back to his city to catch my flight back home and I still had a lot time to kill. I wanted to see him again but I wasn't sure if he was down. He suddenly offered to see each other again and I was happy to be in his presence again. He made me food, coffee, drove me to the station, gave me a kisses and deep hugs etc. 

I told him I was interested and thanked him. He said I could stay at his place anytime I return, and he'd let me know when he's in my country. He also told me to reach out anytime, whenever I need him, that he's here. While he seems to want to stay in touch, he's giving mixed signals. If I visit again and he‚Äôs still so affectionate, I'd have to ask him to stop because it's confusing cosplaying as boyfriends. 

I‚Äôm just confused and if I bring it up he says in an audio message hesitatingly that's just his natural self but it doesn't make sense. I'm trying to take a step back and see if he texts me and asks for life updates to know whether he's really interested. What do you think?",1,1728662864.0,gaybros,0,1.0,False

1g1ddvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1g1ddvs/i_am_wrapping_up_month_3_and_i_am_in_awe/,I am wrapping up Month 3 and I am in awe,"LONG POST - Breakdown of my side effects for first 3 months

26(f), 5'10"", 160lbs. 40/60/80

I know I'm technically only at the halfway point and I still have 2-3 more months of 80mg a day, I am feeling so so confident in my end goal results. I have not purged and I feel like I am passed the point where (progress wise and based on what my skin is doing rn) I don't think I am going to. For the first time EVER my skin is soft???? I still get stuff coming through on my cheeks, jaw/neck and forehead but they are \*tiny\* compared to the massive and deep cysts I used to get. I haven't felt my cheekbones or jawbone ache due to it feeling like they were sitting on my bones since the end of month 1. Don't get me wrong, the side effects are a bit rough.

This is the end of the 1st month of 80mg a day and my lips are still peeling constantly no matter what I put on them, but they aren't cracking (I don't give them the chance to even get dry). I have a cut on the inside edge of **both** nostrils and that's a tad painful and makes it feel like I'm constantly swallowing a little bit of blood (I've had chronic post-nasal drip all my life and now its like a micro nosebleed all day lol) and I am exhausted and unmotivated to do anything and the sun HURTS but gawd dang it I cannot even begin to explain how life changing this has been.

In total, my side effects by month (Month 1-3):

Month 1 - 40mg a day

* Started my period 7 days early - might be unrelated but I'm pretty regular so it def felt related
* Random Sahara Desert level dry patch on both thighs - cleared up within 2 days
* My other meds can cause headaches if I get dehydrated so I am now much much more prone to headaches - not too much of a problem, just have to be aware of how much water I drink
* Woke up one morning in the middle of week 3 and couldn't turn my head to the left - thought I slept wrong but it lasted for like 2 weeks. Deadass Batman turning my whole upper body just to look to my left. Derm said to keep an eye on it and tell her if it doesn't get better, but still bumped me to 60mg/day

Month 2 - 60mg a day

* Stiff neck went away slowly but finally can turn head to the left.
* Exhaustion setting in pretty bad now - I constantly had this ""I'm just so tired"" feeling that would make me cry - I knew this was highly likely to happen. Mood stabilizers can only do so much and it was my dad's birthday this month which is still a rough one for me
* The edge of my lips felt sunburnt all the time, like I burnt them on hot coffee or sat in the sun too long but they weren't dry just spicy feeling
* Dry eyes a few days here and there but nothing major - could be due to exhausted feeling or forgetting to blink (ADHD be like that sometimes)
* Week 2 of this month I woke up and could not form legitimate thoughts. The brain fog was unreal. I couldn't remember words and bombed a presentation I had to give for work. Embarrassing and made me cry. I would try to talk and be unable to find the words, get super frustrated, and then cry. This fog took till the end of month 2 to start to lift. This was one of the worst ""side effects"" I had because I kept telling myself it wasn't Accutane but I still do not know. This was an emotional two weeks lol
* I drove to my appointment (10 minute drive there 10 minutes back) and the left side of my face and left arm was \***sunburnt**\*. I had sunscreen on, I had heavily tinted windows. I literally do not know what happened but I will say till this point if I went outside it was either in the late afternoon/evening or I took an umbrella or wore sleeves and a hat. No clue but made me more cautious

Month 3

* My skin is paper. I get cuts from bumping into dull objects. My fingers are peeling where you would usually get hang nails and I was cutting something in the garden with gloves and and took a 2 inch section of skin off my finger from it rubbing the glove. WILD. Took 2 weeks to heal - still discolored.
* Week 2, neck stiffness was back - couldn't turn left (I woulda SUCKED if I was in NASCAR) and then halfway through week 3 I woke up and it had moved down to the dead center of my back. Felt like I slept wrong but I could not rotate my upper body or lean to fast in any direction. Its still a little sore feeling but is going away.
* Cuts in my nostrils are ROUGH. I get these weird dry pieces of skin the peel off in there no matter how much Aquaphor or Vaseline I put up there. Probably to most annoying thing of all. It is driving me absolutely \*crazy\* but is a small price to pay for skin that doesn't make me believe I am ugly (thanks mom for that looping thought the last 15 years) and to not have my face bones ache lol
* Lips are swollen but mainly because they are peeling and I am anxious picking them - I catch myself too late after I've already ripped pieces off. I am trying to stop I know this is bad.
* Similar to above. I have 3 small pimples on my forehead and 2 on my left cheek that I anxiously rubbed/scratched and are now small scabs. The ones on my cheek are dark red/discolored. Totally my fault and I am trying to get myself to chill out or at least be more aware of me touching my face.
* I woke up this morning with a small pimple on my eyelash line. I know what you're thinking... ""That's just a sty, dude."" Nope, small little pimple. Washed my face as normal and came out and is now gone. No clue man but an odd one I had to mention lol

I don't know what to believe...,"I am so confused and not sure what to believe. I've never dealt with oriental cockroaches (aka waterbugs) before.

I moved to my new apartment (ground floor unit in an area with lots of trees/grass) almost four weeks ago. The first two weeks were non-stop heavy rain and I started seeing large black cockroaches immediately. Not many, like one roach every other day or every few days, but it was freaking me out. My breaking point is when I saw two crawling around on the highest shelf in my closet (almost 8 feet off the ground). I did a lot of research and learned that these are¬†**oriental cockroaches**, which are not the infesting type, but the adults sometimes wander indoors. I forced my landlord to get a pest control service to spray after I put out some traps and caught 4-5 roaches in one night. They explained the the spray wouldn't keep the roaches out but it would kill them when they get in.

My landlord (who owns the condo but actually lived here for 5 years before he rented it to me) is obviously a liar and claimed he never had a bug problem before in all 5 years, so it must just be the rain smh. All that rain stopped over a week ago and I'm still waking up to one dead roach every morning - but at least that means the spray is working. I am afraid of roaches even when they are dead, so I sleep with paper towels and a pair of tongs on my nightstand and the first thing I do when I wake up is go hunting for the dead roach and dispose of it with the tongs. It's a very stressful way to wake up in the morning and I'm constantly scanning the floors while I'm peeing, brushing my teeth, making coffee....instead of doing those things in peace like where I lived before.

Am I supposed to believe that just¬†*one*¬†roach gets in every night while I'm sleeping and dies on the bathroom floor? I know these are not the infesting type but I have to believe more are getting in that I'm not seeing? I've gone looking but I can't find any more dead roaches in cabinets or under the sink or anything. My traps are still empty too.

Not asking for ways to salvage anything. Not going to try again. I now understand that I‚Äôve misinterpreted a few months of pleasant small talk for romantic interest‚Äîhindsight is 20/20

Im really just wondering if I should continue going there, pretending like it never happened, or if it‚Äôd be better to stop going all together. Not sure if the latter is an option. 

Here‚Äôs the context and a brief summary of the conversation I‚Äôm currently cringing about:

I‚Äôm definitely going back to that area again because the coffee shop is in front of the only decent park in my area, and I take my dog there a few times a week.

I started getting coffee there on my way back home a few months ago, and conversations with her have always had a good flow. We‚Äôd joke, talk about interests, future plans and goals, even banter a bit.

A couple of weeks ago it came up in conversation that she‚Äôd be leaving that job at the end of the month but staying local, and today I asked if she wanted to hang out when after she quit.

She said yes, but now she‚Äôll be there until sometime in November.

I asked if I should get her number, or wait until November. 

She said ‚ÄúLets wait‚Äù with a bit of a shrug 

I nodded, we laughed a bit, and I casually gave a goodbye before leaving

I‚Äôll never mention it again unless she does, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôll be better to just get my coffee elsewhere. Again, the shop is along a normal route of mine, and if I abruptly stop going she will definitely notice

To further complicate the situation, I thought another barista that works there liked me because she always made a point to wave from  the other side of the park and we‚Äôve had similarly pleasant chats. But then she (the one I haven‚Äôt asked out) casually told me that she had a boyfriend in conversation a 6 weeks ago or so (we were talking about traveling in Europe and she told me about a trip she took with her boyfriend)

Dude.. I‚Äôm not that guy. I‚Äôve never asked a barista out before, I talked myself out of asking either of them out for months 

I‚Äôm attracted to both of them for different reasons; they have polar opposite styles and personalities 

Fuck, am I a creep? As I proof read this I‚Äôm thinking that I sound like a creep‚Ä¶ 

Give me your honest opinion, but please be gentle, I‚Äôm running on two hours sleep because my radiators were turned on for the first time this season and that shit was loud as hell

I was put on 40mg Omeprazole by my PCP for some reason. A few months in I started to develop acid reflux, but only sometimes. The acid reflux gradually got worse and worse over a few months, so my doctor ordered a HIDA scan, ultra sound, and blood labs. HIDA scan was 89% and ultra sound and blood labs were clear. They said everything is fine. I decided to get an appointment with a GI surgeon which at the time I thought were the same as gastroenterologists, but I guess they‚Äôre not. He ordered an endoscopy and CT scan. Endoscopy showed mild gastritis and the CT scan was fine. The GI surgeon brushed it off and told me to avoid spice, tomatos, coffee, and to stop stressing so much. I was frustrated so I asked to see a different GI surgeon for a second opinion (again at the time I thought they were the same as gastroenterologists). All this one told me was he could take out my gallbladder, but that may or may not solve the problem. He sent me a referral to an actual gastroenterologist, which I didn‚Äôt get to see until June of this year. The time in between seeing the GI surgery and gastroenterologist I switched PCPs. I explained to her I‚Äôm getting worse by the day, and nothing is helping me. She switched me to 40mg Pantoprazole 2x a day and 1gm Carafate 4x a day. From the day I switched PPIs everything got 100x worse with added symptoms. I lost more weight, fatigued, the acid reflux was unbearable, I started getting pain in my right and left ribs. My mental health plummeted, I would have anxiety attacks so bad I would often ball my fist and hit myself in the face and head. Once I got to see the gastro doctor she told me to get off the PPI, because clearly it‚Äôs doing more harm than good. 10 weeks later I‚Äôm off Pantoprazole and Carafate. I now only take OTC Pepcid and handfuls of tums. My gastro told me I would feel better after a week of being off Pantoprazole, but it‚Äôs been a month and I‚Äôm still sickly. I contacted her, and I now have an office appointment at the end of this month and a bravo test/ endoscopy coming up next month. But I‚Äôm so confused about what is causing all this to happen? I‚Äôve read so many posts on this sub and the GERD sub, but nothing is adding up to me and nothing is correlating. The more digging I do the more confused and stressed out I get. I‚Äôm struggling and I‚Äôm always crying because I just want to be normal. It affects every aspect of my life, and I‚Äôm a husk of my old self. Any input or advice is welcome.

I had what felt like heart palpitations and chest pains. I tried eating BRAT diet, simple foods as possible. Everything hurt me. I lost 25lbs in 1 month. (I was 245). 2 trips to the ER and 1 to urgent care (man those heart attack like symptoms are crazt) and it's settled that ""all"" I had was GERD

Famotidine helped but did not fix anything. I also have tinnitus and omeprazole is a potential cause of tinnitus (so is GERD. I theorize it is correlation not causation, and that acid or vapors can indeed travel up your eustation tube and damage your ear drums) But the point is I resisted taking omeprazole for a few months and it did not help me

I'm a chef and I thought my life was over. I'd never be able to eat or drink, or taste anything good again. My dreams for travel and work were done. I began to see myself as a chronically I'll man. I needed to find something I could eat that wouldn't cause reflux

Enter bone broth. I invite you to research bone broth and GERD. It has been incredibly safe. Healing. Nourishing. When I thought I would waste away, I ended up eating more nourishing food than I had for years. And it did not give me reflux. I ate bone broth soup with lean proteins and boiled vegetables, white rice or potato for years. It was repetitive and I had to learn to eat to live. It was indeed delicious and others liked it. But that is all you eat you can hate it after awhile. But I digress

Bone broth is rich on proteins and vitamins, collagen and glutamine. Gut healing power. Bone broth kept me steady and full, able to be an active person. I brought an electric thermos for road trips and brought my lunch. I didn't go out. And slowly,  I began to heal

The omeprazole had not worked fast for me. But it did help and taking consistently I have seen small improvements,  month after month. Until here we are, over 2 years later and I can eat almost whatever I want. I can have a coffee once per day. Still no alcohol. But the improvement I've felt is incredible. I was contemplating ending my existence when this was at its worst and now I can eat delicious food again

In my case, I have a small hiatal hernia. I know that this not a cure all, and some People with a physical dysfunction of the LES cannot heal regardless. But my story is one of slow, steady, incremental, marginal, healing, with lots of back and forth. But i made it to a place where i can be really happy again. And I hope you can too. At the very least I hope you.can eat something nourishing and life giving 

You will need a slow cooker (I use instant pots slow cook feature) some quart containers,  a strainer, another large pot. And patience. You can buy veal bones at a restraunt depot very cheaply (2.50 a lb) or at a butcher or grocery store. I.like RD cause I'm familiar shopping there and it's very affordable. Anyone with an EIN can get a membership, it's free

Take out flavoring ingredients as needed. I'm lucky that onions don't seem to bother me

BONE BROTH

Look at the size of your pot. Take out enough bones to fill 1/3 of the volume of your pot in bones and set on a roasting pan. Roast bones at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes,  or until they smell delicious and look browned. Put roasted bones in pot

OPTIONAL Roast veggies
Rough chop 2 carrots, an onion, 2 stalks of celery, and put them on the pan that has the leftover been fat. Roll them around and Roast them in the oven for about 12 minutes, until browned. Put in pot. Veg doesn't require roasting but it enhances flavor

Add 2 bay leaf, a sprig of thyme or rosemary or both, several whole pieces of garlic

Fill pot 4/5ths with water. All ungredients dhouod be submerged. Simmer or slow cook 18 hours. At work I  do on stove top but I like to use an appliance at home, it's safer and more reliable. 

Use a collander and strain the soup into another pot. Make sure you have another pot under the collander (I've strained right into the sink, it happens) discard the bones and veg. 

You should have a nice rich brown broth. Optional step, you can reduce further for a more fortified, even richer broth. If you reduce by half or more you have the makings of a proper demi-glace haha. 

Season with salt or seasonings of your tolerance. The broth will not taste good without salt or seasonings. I love DASIDA BEEF BULLION a Korean beef bullion brand available at hmart and online. It has msg but that doesn't bother me and it enriches flavor so much. 

Now pour into quart container and and allow to cool before lidding a and refrigerating. this is an important step!

As it cools, all the fat will solidify at the top and we are going to scrape that off and trash it. Looking for lean low fat meals and the natural process here helps us so much. The broth should have a jello like semi firm or firm consistency. If your broth is too watery, reccomend reducing further, or adding more bones to your next batch, or a combo of both. Of course a thinner broth can be enjoyed just as well!

Boil some carrots and broccoli separate, or directly in your broth. If you direct in the broth you get 100% of the nutrients but will alter the flavor and if you have too much of one or the other it can be too strong veggie flavor. Boil potatoes or consume with white or brown rice. 
For protein I eat lots of grilled chicken, pan seared chicken, roasted chicken, and ground turkey fried hard 

Sweet potato can be added as well, although it will emulsify with the broth and create a different delicious flavor profile

I wish you all healing, nourishment, and meals without pain or fear. Lmk how this works with you I'm happy to coach anyone in greater detail to achieve a delicious product. I ate nothing but this and miso soup + rice and tofu for 2 years and it did me wonders ",2,1728662059.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

I like the look and the small footprint on the kitchen counter. I would be happy with it as long the output is comparable to the Vertuo or a little better.  
I have seen an extensive and well-done review on Youtube [Nespresso - Unforgettable Mornings Ease 15"" | US (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9jt-K38upc)

I like the look and the small footprint on the kitchen counter. I would be happy with it as long the output is comparable to the Vertuo or a little better.  
I have seen an extensive and well-done review on Youtube that shows the Baristina to grind slightly coarse, which would be suitable only for medium or dark roast, which is ok with me since I like it that way. So, I have tested more than 20 shots, long and regular, using 3 different beans from medium-dark and dark: 1 from Illy (Dark roast) and 2 from Whole Food Organic line of coffee (1 medium-dark and the other dark decaf). I mostly used the ""boost button"" because honestly without it, the coffee is too light.

The same reviewer I mentioned above, also weighted the amount of coffee the Baristina should be grinding and on his machine, it was 9-10 grams without the boost, and shy of 12 gr with the boost. Mine so far does not achieve that: it started at 6gr, and at best it reached 9 grams after 20 grinds. The pucks were also visibly too short when I extract them. I though the grinder needed more time to adapt to the beans and break-in a bit, or the darker oily beans may stick and not flows well enough, it was a bit of both.

After the 10th shots it was grinding closer to 8 to 9 grams (rather than the initial 6), but yet never 12 grams. I even tried to push the beans down while grinding. On a positive note, the grinder is fairly quiet.

I then tried to fill the portafilter manually tamping 12 grams of Illy Intenso and in that case the regular shot was good: better than a Vertuo single shot capsule and similar to something you get from a regular bar in Italy. With 12 gr tamped in, the lungo also was comparable to a Vertuo double shot capsule. Definitively suitable for a more than decent cappuccino. But obviously if I have to go through grinding separately and tamping the coffee I would get a Breville espresso maker and put up with the work it requires.

If it was for the single regular shot, I think it would be an acceptable sostitute for the Vertuo, but the lungo with the boost, as long as the machine will keep grinding less than 12 grams of beans, it will make it a candiate for a return or a sale on ebay.

So, I will try to use it for one or two more weeks and see if the grinder improves and update this post.

Cheers.

Same save file running as host works fine,"Hey, I would like to describe a specific issue that me and my buddy encountered during our playthrough on the version 1.0.

I would like to start with describing the issue. So we're playing coop, 2 players. My friend is hosting the game. We built quite a lot and in heavily occupied areas the fps is lower which is absolutely normal and understandable, still playable and good. I am joining his server and for me the situation is very different.  
Im normally running about 100-160fps with almost 100% gpu usage all the time. Our factory has something I used to call ""dark zones"" at this point. Its an area in the factory where my fps goes from stable 100-160 to very stuttering 50's, 30's, 20's and even 10 fps. The deeper in the zone the worse it gets. The weirdest thing is that my gpu usage in the dark zone drops to 20-30%, checked on multiple tools and I can even see the temp drops on gpu and fans turn off since there is no load. The dark zone is heavily occupied and I would expect the load to stay on 100% but for some reason it doesnt. I pretty much know where the dark zone ends and once I cross the border my fps magically jumps to 160 and gpu load is back on full. I can understand that the game has to load a lot of things once I cross the border of the dark zone, maybe I am entering different ""chunk"" of a map which results in this BUT - the gpu load drop is super weird and leaves me confusing. 

What are our pc specs ?  
We both run basically the same specs:  
ryzen 7800x3d  
32GB RAM 6000MT/s  
NVME SSD SAMSUNG PRO 980  
RTX 3060 (mine), RTX 3080 (my friend)  
We both run 600+Mbit/s fibre internet connection, wired to the pc btw

What we tried to do to fix the issue ?

First and most important - he sent me the save and I opened the game as host. Bam, problem gone. My fps are lower once I enter the dark zone but its over 60fps and no stutters, gpu load on point. No issues.  
My friend joins as client to my host game and he is experiencing the same problem as I used to have.

OK, so the pc's are not the issue, internet connection, speed and ping is not as well.

We tried: basically any option in the video settings, low, high, dlss etc on off high low, any configuration, full screen, windowed, vsync on off. Doesnt make any difference.

We tried changing the network quality settings as well to any config, with no results. GPU drivers couple of versions, no results.

Im not a tech guy but I can assume this whole situation has to do something with bottlenecks on transferring the host data to the client (what to render etc), so the client's pc gets confused AF and the gpu doesnt know what to do. 

My question is - did any of you encountered something like this? Do you think my hipothesis is right ? Do you have any idea how to fix this ? At this point I can't build anything in the dark zone without getting epilepsy attack, so any ideas are welcomed :)

PS: It got way worse once we built a massive 60 pipe pipeline. I think it's the epicentre of the dark zone, the fps is the worst once I reach the pipes.

So I've recently started buying decent enough beans.  They're a medium roast and ground as low as the Delonghi Dedica Grinder can go. Also two to three weeks from roasting and kept either in the fridge in a sealed bag or in a Fellow Atmos container.

I've also just gotten a 12 to 14 grams ims basket in an attempt to lower caffeine consumption. I've had 3 bad shots today due to overfilling and ended up having water go everywhere but the puck.

After that I reduced my dosage to 10 grams. Even then I got a small amount of water going around the portafilter and the shot ended up being (very) watery.

For context, since I've started getting good beans, I've successfully pulled good shots with an 18 grams unpressurized basket. I am using WDT, leveling then tamping  + a wet paper filter at the bottom to help with spraying.

As I understood so far, pulling single shots is difficult by itself, but still, I wanted to have less caffeine in my system while still having 3 cups of coffee a day. 

Are these results expected with my current setup, as in, is it close to impossible to pull 10 to 14 grams with this machine + grinder combo?

Have any of you tried the same recipes?

TDLR: my sister ghosted me for months. Told parents she was upset with me. Told parents not to tell me. They did. I stopped talking to sister. Parents got involved trying to get us to talk. Mother said WILD things. And now I don‚Äôt talk to any of them. 

Hello, so background. I (22F) have a sister (32F). We have mostly always been super close. Growing up we had a really ruff childhood. And our parents abused us. Because of this and the age gap my sister became more of a parent and best friend than sister. 

Starting around February my sister suddenly started talking to me less and ignoring my calls. We went from talking multiple times a week/day to once a week maybe. But she always told me she was busy so I tried to understand. 

Then the beginning March she suddenly stopped talking to me all together. I would call her multiple times a day. Then give it a couple of days. I text her but she wouldn‚Äôt respond. This went on for weeks. 

While growing up my relationship with my parents was bad now that I‚Äôm an adult it had gotten a lot better. So I still talked to my dad. I was talking to him about the situation mostly kinda joking about it. He asked my if I had done something. And if she was mad at me. I told him the truth and that if she was mad at me, I had no reason why. Then my dad said well if she doesn‚Äôt talk to you then I‚Äôm not watching her kids tomorrow. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt think much of that statement because I thought he was using my an excuse not to watch her kids. Haha. 

My dad told my sister this and I also sent her a text asking why we stopped talking? And that I was genuinely curious and clueless because we used to talk all the time. I was left on delivered for days. 

Well it came out, (because my dad told me) that the day he said that my sister got into a big fight with my parents about it. And canceled her plans just so she didn‚Äôt have to talk to me. She told my mom and dad that she was mad at me because I have repeatedly miss my 2 nieces and nephews birthdays for years. And that I didn‚Äôt invite her to breakfast when I went with my parents and my husband. She also told my parents not to tell me why she was mad at me and to essentially live me in the dark. But of these are things that happened months ago. And we had talked like everything was fine after. 

I told my parents when they tried to talk about it that I wanted an apology. Something I‚Äôve never received ever in this family. Not an apology for her being mad. But for leaving me in the dark and ignoring me. My mother made excuses for my sister. And said the reason she didn‚Äôt say anything was for me and my mental health. 

My mother got mad and said that for Mother‚Äôs Day all she wants is is to get along. And if we can‚Äôt do that not to talk to her til we grow tf up. 

My sister said that she wanted to meet up. At a coffee place and talk. I was hesitant. For the fact that I don‚Äôt drive and if Shizz goes sideways I‚Äôm stranded there. But I decided I would go if she told me watch we‚Äôd be talking about. Because she still didn‚Äôt know I knew why she was mad. She lost it. Said she wouldn‚Äôt tell me said she wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation on the phone. So I hung up. 

Months go by. My mother tries to get involved again. When I‚Äôm talking to my father. She goes in on me. Talking over me the whole time. Here‚Äôs some of my favorites. 

1. I don‚Äôt understand my sister because I don‚Äôt have children and I won‚Äôt understand til I do. 
2. That she wishes I would have a child as to humble myself. 
3. That I‚Äôm fighting with my sister to somehow recreate the bad relationship my husband has with his brother. 
4. My husband and his brother have a bad relationship because they didn‚Äôt have a dad. 
5. My feelings are a personal problem.
6. She doesn‚Äôt know why I have to act like the black sheep of the family. 

There‚Äôs more but I think you get the picture. And the end she asked me if I had anything to say. I was so defeated by this point I was crying. I told her talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. And I was going to say more but my phone died. 

I haven‚Äôt talked to them since. This happened in July. I‚Äôve kinda been No Contact with them all. Since then these are the messages I‚Äôve received.

1g1cxzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1g1cxzf/i_find_just_one_dead_oriental_cockroach_every/,I find just one dead oriental cockroach every morning when I wake up....are there more hiding? ,"I am so confused and not sure what to believe. I've never dealt with oriental cockroaches (aka waterbugs) before.

I moved to my new apartment (ground floor unit in an area with lots of trees/grass) almost four weeks ago. The first two weeks were non-stop heavy rain and I started seeing large black cockroaches immediately. Not many, like one roach every other day or every few days, but it was freaking me out. My breaking point is when I saw two crawling around on the highest shelf in my closet (almost 8 feet off the ground). I did a lot of research and learned that these are¬†**oriental cockroaches**, which are not the infesting type, but the adults sometimes wander indoors. I forced my landlord to get a pest control service to spray after I put out some traps and caught 4-5 roaches in one night. They explained the spray wouldn't keep the roaches out but it would kill them when they get in.

My landlord (who owns the condo but actually lived here for 5 years before he rented it to me) is obviously a liar and claimed he never had a bug problem before in all 5 years, so it must just be the rain smh. All that rain stopped over a week ago and I'm still waking up to one dead roach every morning - but at least that means the spray is working. I am afraid of roaches even when they are dead, so I sleep with paper towels and a pair of tongs on my nightstand and the first thing I do when I wake up is go hunting for the dead roach and dispose of it with the tongs. It's a very stressful way to wake up in the morning and I'm constantly scanning the floors while I'm peeing, brushing my teeth, making coffee....instead of doing those things in peace like where I lived before.

Am I supposed to believe that just¬†*one*¬†roach gets in every night while I'm sleeping and dies on the bathroom floor? I know these are not the infesting type but I have to believe more are getting in that I'm not seeing? I've gone looking but I can't find any more dead roaches in cabinets or under the sink or anything. My traps are still empty too and I'm pretty sure I've only caught/killed adults, I've never seen a baby roach. Do you all think there are more hiding?",2,1728661746.0,pestcontrol,2,1.0,False

1g1csav,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1g1csav/i_got_attached_to_my_hookup_of_three_weeks/,I got attached to my hookup of three weeks,"Hi guys. It‚Äôs my first time to post here at Reddit. I just wanted to get this off my chest. (Bear with me if you can as it‚Äôs so long)

I‚Äôm not gonna grammar check or anything this as this is my raw story. From the heart. 

In these past weeks, I met someone from the Grindr App (yes, i‚Äôm gay). We were already talking on Bumble but I think I didn‚Äôt respond to his last message as it was an open-ended answer. (Tbh, I wasn‚Äôt really looking for anything serious that time.)


I usually go to Makati to get coffee and really just to chill and go to the gym afterwards. I‚Äôm from the south. (I think u r wondering why I go to makati just to get coffee it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm really bored. I work from home.)

One night I went to makati to go to the gym and I opened my app. I messaged him (not knowing it was him obviously because most of the profile there is faceless.)

 I sent my album and he sent his. (I didn‚Äôt really recognize him at first. He was using another photo not his bumble photos)


I asked him where he was and he told me that he was in the gym that I was about to go to. Fast forward, I didn‚Äôt see him in the gym and he didn‚Äôt respond hours after that so I didn‚Äôt really messaged him again. 

After my gym session, i opened my app and he messaged me and he invitee me to his place to sleep there. I was kinda hesitant at first because he might kill me (lol)

But I went to his place. It was a walking distance from the gym I and him went to. 

I went to his unit and showered. 

We layed on his bed. It was such a comfy bed. I felt nothing really at first because I know for a fact that it‚Äôs just a hook up. We cuddled and he wanted me to sleep there but cannot as I‚Äôm not comfortable and I need to attend to my car. 

I went home around 3am. Said my thank you and drove home. 


After that week, I went to makati again and he messaged me where I am and I replied and he asked me if I want to go to the gym with him. I said okay.  After the gym session, he asked me if I wanted to go to his unit again and I said okay. 


He asked me if I want to shower with him. I declined politely as i‚Äôm really shy. 


After he showered, I showered too. We exchanged numbers that night. He asked me to save his number and I did.  After that Went straight to the bed and cuddlee again with him. But for some reason, this some it felt nothing like our first encounter. As the minutes passed by, i feel like theres something different. Maybe I was overthinking because we went to the gym first before cuddling lol. So naive right? 


It was around 2:00am. I told him that if he wants me to go because he needs to go to work at around 8am and he plans to go the gym at around 7am. Also he was out for the whole day and I can feel that he was really sleepy. 

I asked him ‚Äúdo you want me to go home na so you can sleep na?‚Äù He said ‚Äúno.‚Äù Then hugged me so tightly as if he wants me just to stay there. 

It moved me to be honest.  Until now whenever I think of it.

When I left his unit, it felt so different. Day and night difference from our first encounter. 

I went home and messaged him saying thank you. The usual. He replied in the morning saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

As the days passes, the feeling that I felt that night didn‚Äôt dissipate. It grew into something. I kinda like/d him. I thought it was just something that I wont remember in the  next few days. I was wrong. 

A week after that we met again in the gym but we didn‚Äôt hang after the gym session. I was so happy to see him that night. He went home before me. He said goodbye and I said my goodbye as well. 

That night that I saw him. I couldn‚Äôt really understand the feeling that I was feeling that time. I thought of asking him for a date but in a very subtle way of asking. I‚Äôm really shy. I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep well that night. And finally, i decided to ask him for a cheesecake date. 

I mustered all my courage to ask him out that morning. i asked him he could go with me to eat my favourite cheesecake.  He replied ‚Äúwhy are you messaging me here in grindr?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can just message me using my number i prefer it that way‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm gonna update you later if i‚Äôm able to go with you‚Äù i replied ‚Äú maybe you didn‚Äôt want me to message you using your number‚Äù ‚Äúokay just update me and no pressure‚Äù 


Fast forward, i went to makati to get my favourite cheesecake. He told me that okay he‚Äôll meet me there in the restaurant and i told him okay see you.

I saw him entering the restaurant. My heart started to pound. I felt happy when I saw him. We ordered one cheesecake only because the cheesecake is good for two people. We talked for like an hour and drove him to his friend‚Äôs place. I told him thanks for the time and said goodbye

It was such a short date but I really enjoyed every bit of bit. I felt my heart pounding that night. I messaged him that night and he didn‚Äôt reply and i felt so bad. Maybe i overlooked the signs. But he messaged me around 9pm asking me where I was. I didn‚Äôt tell hin where I was because I know for a fact that I was getting attached. 

Such a naive boy.

After that night, he messaged me ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù 
I replied ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù too long story short I confessed what I was feeling and he told me it‚Äôs still too early which it was really too early because we only met a couple of times. I agreed. He told me that we are gonna date and we‚Äôll see where it goes from there. I felt happy to be honest that I was able to say what I really felt but also scared that I might get hurt again. 

That day, we met to jog and note that I don‚Äôt really jog but I joined him because I wanted to spend some quality time with him. Just for the record, he didn‚Äôt force me to jog with him. I invited myself. 

So we jogged at Ayala Triangle. I felt so happy and so tired because I don‚Äôt really jog and it‚Äôs been years. We jogged around 4K+ for 30 mins. I was so happy that time being able to do things outside the bedroom and think that we might stand a chance. I drove him back to his place. And he told me ‚Äúsee you next week‚Äù. Fuck i can still remember his voice saying that to me. I‚Äôm teary-eyed writing this. 

On the weekend, he went back to his province to accompany his auntie. Nothing much happened that weekend. He updated me whenever he can. 

My anxiety kicked in. I‚Äôm the type of person when I get serious with someone, I like being updated. I feel bad when I don‚Äôt. Yeah. It‚Äôs such a needy trait. 

Come Monday, he didn‚Äôt said good morning and i messaged him saying good morning. No reply. I messaged him again around 11am. I asked hin if he was still asleep. He replied quickly. ‚Äú i‚Äôm awake good morning‚Äù i replied back ‚Äúdid you just wake up?‚Äù
He replied ‚Äúno i woke up around 9-10am sorry about that i did my meal prep and studied‚Äù

I felt kinda bad but I sucked it up. Said ‚Äúno worries go do your thing‚Äù 

After few hours, he messaged me that he was going back to manila i replied ‚Äú okay be careful driving the road is wet‚Äù. 

He messages me around the after said that he‚Äôs in already. I asked him he was in the office already he replied ‚Äúyes.‚Äù


Later that night he messaged me ‚Äú just done with work going to the gym now‚Äù i replied ‚Äúokay be careful going to the gym‚Äù he asked me where I was. I said ‚Äú home but if you want me to go there i‚Äôll go there‚Äù he told me that i should decide. I asked him one more time ‚ÄúYou want or not‚Äù. He replied ‚Äúgo here if you want you shouldn‚Äôt wait for me to tell you. If you want go here‚Äù
I got pissed off and i don‚Äôt know why. I think i just wanted him to say that he wanted me to go see him. I didn‚Äôt replied for hours and I replied midnight. ‚ÄúSorry, i just wasn‚Äôt in the mood‚Äù 

The morning after that, he didin‚Äôt reply oe said good morning and i didn‚Äôt too. The whole day we didn‚Äôt message. And that just might be one of my biggest regret. Maybe I had just replied back and message him that morning maybe i wouldn‚Äôt have wrote this. 

A day after that he message me saying goodbye. Basically, he thinks that we are not compatible and it crushed me. I cried but didn‚Äôt respond. I delete his contact and his message for me to control the urge to message him.

This is just a rant to really get this off my chest. I really regretted the way I acted. I feel so stupid but I learned. 
I learned that if you wang something say it and go for it. 

If ever you are reading this which 99.9% chance that you are not but if the .1% succeeded, this is what I want to say to you.

Dear J

I‚Äôm sorry for being a pain in the ass. I wished it ended differently. I wished I acted differently and be more upfront, and chill. If I can just change the outcome I will and still now I regret it. I‚Äôm so fucking into you. I hope you passed your exam for the states. I only wish the best for you and thank you for making me feel some emotions in our short-lived dating experience. 

You left a hole in my heart. 

All the best,

G

‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù Rosie then tugged at my sleeve, like she had done earlier in the evening when we were trick-or-treating. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a [*Fire-starter*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/yA5zlREVtX)*?*‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie, sweetie. We‚Äôll have to watch it, but when you‚Äôre a little older.‚Äù

Rosie shrugged her shoulders. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

My daughter rubbed her eyes and yawned. I yawned too, stretched my back as best I could in the tight confines of this children‚Äôs tree house, and started to fall asleep.

Rosie asking me a question woke me up. ‚ÄúDo you know where the bad men took Ben, Mommy?‚Äù

I sighed, watching the sun slowly rise in the horizon. ‚ÄúNo, Rosie, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù I replied, stretching my hand. A dull pain radiated throughout my knuckles. A faint evil laugh echoed in my head. ‚ÄúBut I think I know of someone who might.‚Äù

A rush of anger flooded throughout my body, giving me just enough energy to sit up. I pat Rosie on the leg, trying to wake her up some. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon honey, it‚Äôs time to go. We can‚Äôt stay up here forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm tired, Mommy! Let‚Äôs just nap for a little bit?‚Äù She held my hand, giving me her biggest puppy dog eyes yet. As much as I wanted to give in to the will of my little girl, there was no telling where my son was and what god awful things people were doing to him. Every second counted.

‚ÄúI know baby, I‚Äôm tired too,‚Äù I sighed, holding back a yawn, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôve got to go now okay? We‚Äôve got to bring your brother home.‚Äù

Rosie took a second to mull it over. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, picking herself up and patting the dust off the charred remnants of her witch costume.

I grabbed Rosie before she could leave out of the tree house‚Äôs entrance. ‚ÄúWait sweetie, let Mommy go first.‚Äù¬†

If there were any lingering dangers outside I was going out to face it first. There was no way in Hell I was letting anything *else* happen to my daughter. With all the blood and carnage I‚Äôd seen in the past few hours, there was no chance I was risking her safety. Lord knows the regret I‚Äôd been feeling letting my children eat those damned lollipops made by my psychotic next door neighbor.

Slowly, I climbed down the ladder, scanning the empty park with caution. After waiting a minute to see if any left over militia men would ambush me, I remained unharmed. I gave Rosie the okay signal. Slowly she made her way down the rickety steps. I tried to use my power to hold the old tree steady, but I was so worn out I had no idea if it was working or not.

I had no idea how *anything* worked anymore.

Rosie jumped off the ladder and into my arms. I held her in a tight embrace, silently vowing to never let her go.

‚ÄúLook how pretty the sunrise is, Mommy,‚Äù she said, pointing at the warm tones that filled the sky.

I let her go, staring at the sky with her. ‚ÄúI see, baby. I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think Ben can see it too?‚Äù¬†

I grabbed Rosie‚Äôs hand and started walking towards the park‚Äôs entrance, wiping a stray tear from my cheek. ‚ÄúSure honey, he can see it too,‚Äù I lied, trying to give us hope. If we were going to get through this, I needed to believe my boy was alright. ‚ÄúAll three of us are looking at the sky right now. Like we‚Äôre all together again.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAll together again‚Ä¶‚Äù Rosie repeated in a whisper.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Ben, your little sister will come rescue you! We‚Äôre superheroes now!‚Äù Rosie shouted proudly, releasing her grasp on my hand. She took off running. I chased after her, unsure if any more soldiers were around.¬†

I caught up to her and trapped her in a bear hug. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run off like that, Rosie!‚Äù I scolded. I loosened my shaking grasp, looked her in the eyes, and swept some unkempt hair out of her ash covered face. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre excited and want to save your brother, but the bad men are still out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, mommy,‚Äù she apologized, tears forming on the cusp of her waterline.

I sighed and hugged her again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay sweetie. I‚Äôll tell you what, we‚Äôre going to play a game.‚Äù

‚ÄúA game!?‚Äù Rosie piped up as I walked up to the first car I could find. I tugged on the handle, finding it was locked. I gave up and moved onto the next car.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to pretend we‚Äôre spies, okay, Rosie-posey? We‚Äôve gotta be quiet and sneaky so the bad guys can‚Äôt get us.‚Äù

Rosie jumped up and down excitedly. ‚ÄúI love playing spies!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you do, kiddo,‚Äù I chuckled softly as we came across a rusted blue pickup truck down the street. I tugged at the door handle, which miraculously opened. There wasn‚Äôt a key in the ignition, so I opened one of the visors. A set of car keys jingled as they fell on to the drivers seat.¬†

Our luck was seemingly turning around.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon Rosie, hop in,‚Äù I said, walking around and opening the passenger side door.

Rosie reluctantly joined me, hopping into the passenger seat. ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt this stealing? You always tell Ben and I not to steal, mommy.‚Äù

I cursed myself for trying to be a good parent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not *stealing* it per se,‚Äù I said, buckling her in, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just *borrowing* it for a little bit, alright?‚Äù

Rosie shrugged her shoulders before dropping the subject.

I closed her door before making my way back to the drivers side of the car. I rested one hand on the top of the truck and the other on the door.¬†

Exhaustion wracked my body. I had very little energy left, but I needed this to work. I needed to be able to use my power. I needed to be able to do this for my son and my daughter.

My eyes were shut tight as I wished and prayed the truck would become invisible like I had been earlier. If Rosie turned invisible just by touching me, I hoped the same thing would happened with inorganic objects.

I felt a small tug in my gut. When I opened my eyes, the truck and Rosie were both gone. Cautiously, I made my way into the truck.

It was trippy. The moment I stepped foot in the truck‚Äôs cabin, I could see both the interior and Rosie again. I still knew we were still invisible though, I could feel it.¬†

Now we could go home without being seen by anyone.

I put the keys in the ignition, causing the truck to roar to life. I pulled out into the street and slowly headed for the house. The radio buzzed on, an alternative and rock station had just started playing ‚ÄúDisarm‚Äù by *The Smashing Pumpkins*. A shiver jolted down my spine as the band name brought back horrific memories from earlier that night.

Our once small and peaceful town looked like the set of a post apocalyptic movie.¬†

Military vehicles littered the streets. Stray children roamed about while others were running for their lives as soldiers chased after them.

Large pillars of smoke billowed into the sky as small fires were burning everywhere.

I had to park the car as another hummer drove past us. The open back revealed a bunch of guns being shoved in some kids faces. My hand covered Rosie‚Äôs eyes as it drove further down the street. I think I recognized one of them as one of the other PTA mom‚Äôs daughter. She was a good kid. She didn‚Äôt deserve to be treated like that.¬†

The scenery outside got particularly bad as we neared our house. Near ground zero. We were neighbors with the woman that caused this superpower outbreak after all.

We passed a house with another Hummer parked in the driveway. It was being used to transport dead bodies. All around us, military personnel were piling bodies of the deceased up and then loading as many they could fit in the back of their vehicles. Medic‚Äôs carried body after body out of houses all around town.¬†

The aftermath of everything that happened was bizarre to see. You‚Äôd think a war went down here or something.¬†

‚ÄúYay, we‚Äôre home!‚Äù Rosie mumbled sleepily as we slowly rolled up to the house.

‚ÄúWhich still looks relatively untouched, thankfully,‚Äù I muttered to myself. If Rosie heard me, she didn‚Äôt seem to care. I knew that look in her eyes. She was eager to get to bed.

I let Rosie rest her eyes for a moment as I double checked our outside surroundings. To my relief, the street was clear of the scary looking Hummers and soldiers. I scanned Laurie‚Äôs property. Her porch was empty, but she was there. The smoke of a recently put out cigarette rising from her crystal ashtray clued me in. I also figured she was inside considering the power was still out on our block, yet, a faint glowing light could be seen behind her windows.¬†¬†

Presence of life was good, because that meant I could end it.

I gently tapped Rosie awake, my pointer finger pressed against my lips to let her know to be quiet. She shook her head In acknowledgment. Slowly, very slowly, I opened the door to the truck, unbuckled her seatbelt, then slid Rosie over the middle console and onto my lap, letting her jump out first. I made sure to maintain skin to skin contact the whole time, still unsure if I could keep things invisible without touching them. It was my turn to get out next. After cautiously sliding out of the driver's seat, I once again carefully shut the car door. I released my grip off the vehicle. The camouflage the blue rust bucket had been under started to dissipate.¬†

Holding hands, Rosie and I then carefully tip-toed through the yard, past my Jeep with its poor deflated tires, and into the house. As soon as we made it past the doorway, I almost dropped to the floor from exhaustion, unable to use my ability any longer.¬†

Despite looking normal on the outside, the inside of my home was in complete disarray. A rancid smelling mixture of burnt smoke and rotten eggs clung to the air. The result of the firefight between my children the night before.

Not wanting to be in there longer than I had to be, I did what we came back to the house for. Stationing Rosie on the couch for another little power nap, I ran up to her room, being mindful of the leftover puddles and my water-damaged floors, to try and grab a fresh set of clothes. Unfortunately her closet hadn‚Äôt survived the fire. I sighed, my only other option being raiding Ben‚Äôs closet. Luckily, his clothes had stayed intact. I nabbed the first things I could find, taking a pair of black basketball shorts and a white shirt.

While upstairs, I also grabbed a change of clothes for myself from my closet and the iPad my kids shared- which, by the grace of God, had mostly charged before the power cut out.¬†

Back downstairs, I woke Rosie up and brought her into the bathroom to change and clean her up. She‚Äôd been wearing that damned damp and tattered witch costume all night. I hoped she hadn‚Äôt caught a cold while hiding out in that treehouse.¬†

To make things easier on myself, I let her play with the iPad as I stripped her down and used a couple water bottles to rinse the dirt and grime off her skin and hair. I dried and brushed her hair as she stared in the mirror, disapproving of the outfit choice. The shorts fit her well enough, reaching just past about half way down her shins, and the shirt was definitely loose. I just shrugged before helping her down from the sink counter she‚Äôd been sitting on, guiding her out of the bathroom. It was my turn to clean up.

My hair went up into a high ponytail after I washed my hands and face, then I changed into jeans and a plain black sweatshirt. Taking an Advil with that last little bit of water, I left the bathroom feeling as refreshed as one could be with the night I‚Äôd had.

Ready to face the world again, Rosie and I left the house. On the way over to Laurie‚Äôs porch, I spotted a decently sized rock and picked it up. It was just the thing I needed to initiate my plan to find out where Ben was taken.¬†

‚ÄúRosie, Mommy needs you to play with your iPad, okay?‚Äù I said, sitting my daughter down on Laurie‚Äôs porch step with her back facing the front door. She nodded in understanding, opening one of her favorite fashion games.¬†

Taking a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell. Fur Elise rang out as I tightened my grasp on the rock, keeping it concealed behind my back. A couple of nerve wracking seconds later, Laurie finally answered her door. ‚ÄúL-Lisa?‚Äù She asked, surprised to see me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing-‚Äú

I cut her off, smashing the rock as hard as I could on her left temple. My rage levels had spiked off the charts. Just *looking* at her after everything that she‚Äôd caused was rage inducing. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your jaw feeling, Laurie?‚Äù

Before she could respond, her eyes rolled to the back of her head as her body fell back on the floor with a loud, satisfying, thud.¬†

The game noises coming from Rosemary‚Äôs tablet suddenly stopped ‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù She asked, concerned.

‚ÄúKeep playing your game!‚Äù I whisper-yelled, dragging Laurie‚Äôs unconscious body further back into her house.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

Did you know that in the seven years we‚Äôve been neighbors, I‚Äôve never once been inside this woman‚Äôs house before?

And yes, it‚Äôs exactly like how a mad scientist‚Äôs house would be depicted in a movie or tv-show. Stacks on stacks of paper littered around every available corner. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what type of flooring she had due to the fact that every square inch of it was covered in manila folders, each having some kind of identifying chicken scratch on them. Laurie‚Äôs living room could‚Äôve made it onto an episode of *Hoarders* with the amount of equipment and junk that had been piled up on her couch, coffee table, and around her tv stand. Though she‚Äôd turned the kitchen into some sort of makeshift lab, the only ‚Äúinhabitable‚Äù area on the first floor seemed to be the adjacent dining room. A chill ran down my spine as I shuddered to think of what the upstairs looked like.¬†

After dragging my neighbor‚Äôs limp body through the hoarder house, I propped her up on one of the back table chairs. Laurie‚Äôs head lolled to the side, her tongue falling out of her mouth. The thought that she could be dead crossed my mind. She *was* on the older side and I *had* hit her pretty hard. Then a soft moan left her mouth, indicating that she was still alive. *Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs* style, I pushed her head straight up, her tongue retreating back into her mouth as I did so.¬†

Conveniently, a bundle of red nylon had been hanging off the back of another one of the table chairs. Unraveling it, I began tying Laurie down, starting with binding her wrists to the armrests then moving on to her ankles.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMommy, can I come in yet?‚Äù Rosemary called from the front door impatiently, a bored expression displayed on her face as her iPad dangled by her knees.¬†

Turning away from the door, a light groan left my lips as I rubbed my eyes until stars enveloped my vision. ‚ÄúGive me just a second, sweetie,‚Äù I answered.¬†

After making sure Laurie‚Äôs bindings were secure, I drug a chair out of the dining room, placing it right outside the doorway on the living room side. After a quick check to make sure no military prowlers were roaming the streets looking to pick up any stray super children, I ushered my daughter inside the house and guided her to her seat.

From the dining room, Laurie began to stir. My heart started racing, it wouldn‚Äôt be long until she woke up. Not wanting Rosie to hear any of what was about to ensue, I dug my earbuds and phone out of my pockets, quickly opening my music app and pulling up the last playlist that was on before. Once the earbuds were in, Rosie happily started kicking her feet to the rhythm of T*he Offspring‚Äôs* ‚ÄúThe Kids Aren‚Äôt Alright‚Äù while she continued to innocently play on her tablet.

I didn‚Äôt have time to change it from my playlist back to a kid friendly one, okay? At least she was facing away from our neighbor that I had tied up in the kitchen.

God, I‚Äôm a bad mother.

My attention turned back to the dining room. The noises coming out of Laurie‚Äôs mouth becoming more frequent, so I made a quick trip to the kitchen and filled up a random cup I‚Äôd found with cold tap water.¬†

Deciding to speed up the process, most of the water in the cup was dumped on to the mad scientist‚Äôs head and lap.¬†

‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù Laurie asked breathlessly, looking around frantically as the icy water shocked her system awake. She soon discovered that I had tied her up, beginning to squirm and tug at her binds all while looking at me with wide, terrified eyes. All that movement had irritated her head wound, causing Laurie to wince in pain.

Narrowing my seething eyes, I splashed the leftover water in the cup at her, making sure to hit that angry looking cut on her temple.¬†

She cried out a strained, guttural groan, beginning to tremble something fierce. ‚ÄúP-please don‚Äôt hurt me! I‚Äôm- I‚Äôm about to become a very rich person,‚Äù she laughed out nervously. ‚ÄúWhat do you want? I can get you money, drugs, *power*, anything!‚Äù¬†

Fishing the rock from earlier out of my pocket, I began to toss it up and down catching it in the palm of my hand. Laurie‚Äôs eyes followed the object a couple times as confusion swirled within them. Then, I willed the chunk of Earth to stay in the air. Slowly turning my wrist to the left, the atoms and minerals that made up the stone separated, leaving behind tiny particles that twinkled as the dim light above the table reflected off of them. Flicking my wrist to the right returned the rock back to its original state. I then let the mass gently fall back into my palm. ‚ÄúNo thanks, I already have power. I suppose I have you to thank for that, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Laurie said. Her whole demeanor changed from that scared old lady that was pleading for her life just a moment ago to one of indifference. The act was up. ‚ÄúYou ate a lollipop, didn‚Äôt you, Lisa?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm,‚Äù I answered, crossing my arms into my chest. ‚ÄúSo did my children, and as you can see, one of them is missing. Where‚Äôd they take my son, Laurie?‚Äù

The sudden military presence had Laurie‚Äôs scent all over it.¬†

She sighed, adjusting herself in her wet clothes. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, that‚Äôs the one thing I can‚Äôt give you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting out of here until I do.‚Äù

Laurie took a second to mull it over. ‚ÄúFine. See that radio over there?‚Äù She nodded her chin towards the end of the table where a small black radio sat across from me. I hadn‚Äôt noticed it there before. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you come over here and give it to me? With one click of that red button, I can tell my men that you‚Äôre looking for your son. They can take you *right* to him.‚Äù

Involuntarily, my nose turned up at her in disgust. ‚ÄúNice try, but I‚Äôm not an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù My neighbor then bellowed out a deranged laugh, ‚Äúbecause you were stupid enough to give your kids one of my lollipops!‚Äù

I saw red. Before I could think, my hand was gliding across the skin of her right cheek, leaving a satisfying burn on my palm. With how hard I‚Äôd smacked her, I must‚Äôve given her a concussion, definitely a bruise that would take quite some time to heal.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really going to do this?‚Äù Laurie asked, still giggling even after spitting out some blood. ‚ÄúWith your daughter just in the other room? What kind of example are you setting for her?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of example are you setting by giving *children* dangerous superpowers?‚Äù I snapped back angrily. Reacting to my emotions, the ground beneath us started to shake, causing the lights to sway and items all around the house to fall to the floor.¬†

Rosie yelped from the other room. The sound caused my heart to ache. Immediately the trembles stopped as I ran to check on my daughter. For the most part she was okay, just a little rattled up by the house shaking.

Something then clattered behind me. Returning to the dining room, I found Laurie still sitting in her chair. Her knuckles were white as she held onto the chair arms for dear life, looking at me like I could collapse the roof on her any minute. The best part was that, for the moment, she was silent.

I chalked the noise up to be another piece of loose debris and used this opportunity to make my point crystal clear, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fucking worry about my kid. This is between you and me. Now, I‚Äôm going to ask you again, where is Ben?‚Äù

The silence only lasted for a minute before that grating voice of hers started up again. ‚ÄúAll you need to know is that his life is now being dedicated to pursuing a better future for humanity.‚Äù¬†

I felt anger start to bubble up in my gut again. Then, a wicked smile spread on my lips as something interesting came to mind.

‚ÄúDo you want to know what‚Äôs funny, Laurie?‚Äù I asked, closing my eyes, listening to the earth around us.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She indulged me.

The elements that made up our bodies hummed at the same frequency, singing an enchanting song only I could hear. With a deep concentration, I started sorting through the melody, searching for just the right note. ‚ÄúFundamentally, us humans are all made from the same Earth. We all rely on the same minerals and vitamins to keep our bodies alive‚Ä¶‚Äù

My dear neighbor just looked at me, staring into my eyes to see if she could decipher what the hell I was getting at. With a snap of my fingers, it wouldn‚Äôt be too long until she figured it out.

Laurie suddenly doubled over as much as she could as an intensely painful sensation filled her side. She opened her mouth but only choked gasps managed to escape.

‚ÄúKidney stones are at the top of the list of the most painful conditions that a human being can experience. So you see with this ability of mine, I can make it so the minerals and salt in your kidneys crystallize in an instant‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm cooking up a good big one for you now!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúO-okay! Okay!‚Äù Laurie groaned out through gritted teeth, giving me one nasty scowl. ‚ÄúEnough‚Ä¶‚Äù

A delighted expression formed on my face, not expecting her to crumble that fast. I eased up on the kidney stone, ‚ÄúReady to tell me where my son is now, bitch?‚Äù

Laurie then let out a throaty laugh. ‚ÄúEnough playing games. I‚Äôve had my fun.‚Äù

Rosie screamed from the other room as the front door was suddenly kicked open. A soldier pointing an automatic rifle at my daughter burst through the door. The sound of glass shattering in the kitchen revealed another gunman had broken in from the back door. In an instant he had the barrel of the gun trained on me. Frantically, I looked for the radio that had been on the table. It was gone and we were surrounded.

‚ÄúH-how?‚Äù I stammered out, trying to think of a way out of this. I tried to take a step back to my Rosie, but that resulted in both guns safety being switched off.¬†

‚ÄúOh neighbor, you‚Äôre not the only adult here who ate a lollipop!‚Äù

‚Äú*You!?!*‚Äù

Laurie scoffed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sound so surprised, Lisa. I *am* a mad scientist after all. An even madder one now that I‚Äôve developed an amplified intelligence!‚Äù

Now it was my turn to laugh, ruefully. ‚ÄúYou experimented and risked your life, my *children‚Äôs* lives, f-for what?! The off chance you might‚Äôve been granted a superpower. You‚Äôre absolutely insane!

‚ÄúWith science comes sacrifice,‚Äù was all she said, calmly. Too calm. She still had one more trick hidden under her sleeve. I could tell, it was a look Rosemary had given me many times when she was being naughty.¬†

‚ÄùThere was a reason I told you not to eat my candy,‚Äù Laurie began to explain, proving my point. ‚ÄúThrough my experimentation I came to learn why children were the ideal candidates to ingest my serum. It all comes down to one simple reason, they would be the easiest to control, only developing one superpowered neural pathway. Adults on the other hand can and will develop multiple, which makes controlling and creating an army more difficult. If started off young we can break, train, and guide these children to become the best soldiers this planet has ever seen by adulthood.‚Äù

My knees went weak as I understood the weight of her words. Knowing now what she planned on doing to my kids and why they got one power while I got two.

If adults get more than one power, case in point, and Laurie already told me she got super smarts after taking that serum, then‚Ä¶

Suddenly, I was grabbed from behind, my wrists forced together as the back of my knee was kicked in. A hand forced my chin up. I saw Laurie looking down at me. Surprising, considering in my peripheral vision Laurie had still been tied down to that chair.¬†

Super smarts and cloning were Laurie‚Äôs powers?!? *Fucking seriously?*

Before I could try to use one of my abilities, a sharp stabbing pain came from my neck as she jabbed a long needle into a vein, injecting something into my bloodstream.¬†

Whatever it was started working fast. I got extremely light headed, the end of my vision filling with inky black. The hum of the Earth started to sound dissonant compared to the symphony it usually was. My body started to feel heavy and light at the same time as I tried to fight the drug. It was like falling down a never ending abyss.¬†

‚ÄúThank you for walking right into my trap, dear. I‚Äôll have so much fun learning all about that other power you developed,‚Äù I heard Laurie whisper in my ear as my attempt to stay conscious began to fail. My eyes shut voluntarily as the sounds from the outside world began to dim. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Lisa, you‚Äôll get to see both of your kids again, I‚Äôm not a *monster* after all.‚Äù¬†

\*\*\*

I woke up to a bright light humming to life and assaulting my eyelids. My eyes blinked open, slowly adjusting to the lights. Then my last memories came rushing in.¬†

Startled, I jerked upright, finding myself in a mind-numbingly white room. Squinting down, trying to prevent myself from going blind, I discovered the clothes I woke up in were not the ones I had gone to sleep in. My outfit consisted of a pair of white long pants with a matching short sleeved v-neck. The fabric felt like scrubs. Embroidered onto the right breast was a number. *111.* Most concerning of all was the leather collar strapped to my throat that wouldn‚Äôt come off. There seemed to be some type of device attached to it.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I heard suddenly.

My head turned at the sound of that voice. It was then that I found out all the walls were made out of a strong see-through material.

‚ÄúBen!‚Äù I cried, leaping to the wall that divided me from my son. In the middle were a couple of holes to let the air in and circulate. I poked a finger through to touch him, he touched me back. Tears welled up in my eyes. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever see him again. He wore a similar outfit to mine, but with the number *110* instead. He also had that torture device strapped around his neck.

I looked to the right side of the room to find Rosie still asleep on her cot. She was in the same *uniform* as my son and I. ‚ÄúRosie, baby, are you okay?‚Äù I asked her.

Rosemary shot up from her bed at the sound of my voice. ‚ÄúMommy,‚Äù she sobbed, putting her hand up to mine from her side of the wall.

Laurie was right, I did get to see both my children again. The only downside seemed to be that we were locked in some kind of glass prison cell.¬†

A loud bang came from the other side of Ben‚Äôs room, interrupting my family‚Äôs bittersweet reunion. The cause of the disruptive noise came from none other than Jaime, who was also blind folded on top of having one of those collars around her neck too. ‚ÄúWould you keep it down, I‚Äôm trying to sleep!‚Äù

A pair of women‚Äôs heels suddenly sounded out, coming from down the hallway. Ben and Jaime immediately went rigid upon hearing whoever those footsteps belonged to.

The suspense grew as they got louder the closer they came to our cells. Rosie and I looked at each other nervously, not knowing what to expect. I did my best to give her a reassuring nod. ‚ÄúAs long as we‚Äôre together, we can do anything,‚Äù I whispered to her. I looked at Ben and conveyed the same message.¬†

‚Äú109, 110,‚Äù A feminine voice acknowledged Ben and Jaime, passing them by.¬† A small, mousy woman then appeared in front of my cell. She wore dark brown pants that flared out at the bottoms, paired with a tan button up, all worn under a pristinely white lab coat. Her dirty blonde hair had been styled up in a bun, a few strands left loose to function as faux bangs. She carried a clipboard with her.¬†

‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù Rosie then tugged at my sleeve, like she had done earlier in the evening when we were trick-or-treating. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a [*Fire-starter*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/yA5zlREVtX)*?*‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie, sweetie. We‚Äôll have to watch it, but when you‚Äôre a little older.‚Äù

Rosie shrugged her shoulders. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

My daughter rubbed her eyes and yawned. I yawned too, stretched my back as best I could in the tight confines of this children‚Äôs tree house, and started to fall asleep.

Rosie asking me a question woke me up. ‚ÄúDo you know where the bad men took Ben, Mommy?‚Äù

I sighed, watching the sun slowly rise in the horizon. ‚ÄúNo, Rosie, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù I replied, stretching my hand. A dull pain radiated throughout my knuckles. A faint evil laugh echoed in my head. ‚ÄúBut I think I know of someone who might.‚Äù

A rush of anger flooded throughout my body, giving me just enough energy to sit up. I pat Rosie on the leg, trying to wake her up some. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon honey, it‚Äôs time to go. We can‚Äôt stay up here forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm tired, Mommy! Let‚Äôs just nap for a little bit?‚Äù She held my hand, giving me her biggest puppy dog eyes yet. As much as I wanted to give in to the will of my little girl, there was no telling where my son was and what god awful things people were doing to him. Every second counted.

‚ÄúI know baby, I‚Äôm tired too,‚Äù I sighed, holding back a yawn, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôve got to go now okay? We‚Äôve got to bring your brother home.‚Äù

Rosie took a second to mull it over. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, picking herself up and patting the dust off the charred remnants of her witch costume.

I grabbed Rosie before she could leave out of the tree house‚Äôs entrance. ‚ÄúWait sweetie, let Mommy go first.‚Äù¬†

If there were any lingering dangers outside I was going out to face it first. There was no way in Hell I was letting anything *else* happen to my daughter. With all the blood and carnage I‚Äôd seen in the past few hours, there was no chance I was risking her safety. Lord knows the regret I‚Äôd been feeling letting my children eat those damned lollipops made by my psychotic next door neighbor.

Slowly, I climbed down the ladder, scanning the empty park with caution. After waiting a minute to see if any left over militia men would ambush me, I remained unharmed. I gave Rosie the okay signal. Slowly she made her way down the rickety steps. I tried to use my power to hold the old tree steady, but I was so worn out I had no idea if it was working or not.

I had no idea how *anything* worked anymore.

Rosie jumped off the ladder and into my arms. I held her in a tight embrace, silently vowing to never let her go.

‚ÄúLook how pretty the sunrise is, Mommy,‚Äù she said, pointing at the warm tones that filled the sky.

I let her go, staring at the sky with her. ‚ÄúI see, baby. I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think Ben can see it too?‚Äù¬†

I grabbed Rosie‚Äôs hand and started walking towards the park‚Äôs entrance, wiping a stray tear from my cheek. ‚ÄúSure honey, he can see it too,‚Äù I lied, trying to give us hope. If we were going to get through this, I needed to believe my boy was alright. ‚ÄúAll three of us are looking at the sky right now. Like we‚Äôre all together again.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAll together again‚Ä¶‚Äù Rosie repeated in a whisper.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Ben, your little sister will come rescue you! We‚Äôre superheroes now!‚Äù Rosie shouted proudly, releasing her grasp on my hand. She took off running. I chased after her, unsure if any more soldiers were around.¬†

I caught up to her and trapped her in a bear hug. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run off like that, Rosie!‚Äù I scolded. I loosened my shaking grasp, looked her in the eyes, and swept some unkempt hair out of her ash covered face. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre excited and want to save your brother, but the bad men are still out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, mommy,‚Äù she apologized, tears forming on the cusp of her waterline.

I sighed and hugged her again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay sweetie. I‚Äôll tell you what, we‚Äôre going to play a game.‚Äù

‚ÄúA game!?‚Äù Rosie piped up as I walked up to the first car I could find. I tugged on the handle, finding it was locked. I gave up and moved onto the next car.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to pretend we‚Äôre spies, okay, Rosie-posey? We‚Äôve gotta be quiet and sneaky so the bad guys can‚Äôt get us.‚Äù

Rosie jumped up and down excitedly. ‚ÄúI love playing spies!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you do, kiddo,‚Äù I chuckled softly as we came across a rusted blue pickup truck down the street. I tugged at the door handle, which miraculously opened. There wasn‚Äôt a key in the ignition, so I opened one of the visors. A set of car keys jingled as they fell on to the drivers seat.¬†

Our luck was seemingly turning around.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon Rosie, hop in,‚Äù I said, walking around and opening the passenger side door.

Rosie reluctantly joined me, hopping into the passenger seat. ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt this stealing? You always tell Ben and I not to steal, mommy.‚Äù

I cursed myself for trying to be a good parent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not *stealing* it per se,‚Äù I said, buckling her in, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just *borrowing* it for a little bit, alright?‚Äù

Rosie shrugged her shoulders before dropping the subject.

I closed her door before making my way back to the drivers side of the car. I rested one hand on the top of the truck and the other on the door.¬†

Exhaustion wracked my body. I had very little energy left, but I needed this to work. I needed to be able to use my power. I needed to be able to do this for my son and my daughter.

My eyes were shut tight as I wished and prayed the truck would become invisible like I had been earlier. If Rosie turned invisible just by touching me, I hoped the same thing would happened with inorganic objects.

I felt a small tug in my gut. When I opened my eyes, the truck and Rosie were both gone. Cautiously, I made my way into the truck.

It was trippy. The moment I stepped foot in the truck‚Äôs cabin, I could see both the interior and Rosie again. I still knew we were still invisible though, I could feel it.¬†

Now we could go home without being seen by anyone.

I put the keys in the ignition, causing the truck to roar to life. I pulled out into the street and slowly headed for the house. The radio buzzed on, an alternative and rock station had just started playing ‚ÄúDisarm‚Äù by *The Smashing Pumpkins*. A shiver jolted down my spine as the band name brought back horrific memories from earlier that night.

Our once small and peaceful town looked like the set of a post apocalyptic movie.¬†

Military vehicles littered the streets. Stray children roamed about while others were running for their lives as soldiers chased after them.

Large pillars of smoke billowed into the sky as small fires were burning everywhere.

I had to park the car as another hummer drove past us. The open back revealed a bunch of guns being shoved in some kids faces. My hand covered Rosie‚Äôs eyes as it drove further down the street. I think I recognized one of them as one of the other PTA mom‚Äôs daughter. She was a good kid. She didn‚Äôt deserve to be treated like that.¬†

The scenery outside got particularly bad as we neared our house. Near ground zero. We were neighbors with the woman that caused this superpower outbreak after all.

We passed a house with another Hummer parked in the driveway. It was being used to transport dead bodies. All around us, military personnel were piling bodies of the deceased up and then loading as many they could fit in the back of their vehicles. Medic‚Äôs carried body after body out of houses all around town.¬†

The aftermath of everything that happened was bizarre to see. You‚Äôd think a war went down here or something.¬†

‚ÄúYay, we‚Äôre home!‚Äù Rosie mumbled sleepily as we slowly rolled up to the house.

‚ÄúWhich still looks relatively untouched, thankfully,‚Äù I muttered to myself. If Rosie heard me, she didn‚Äôt seem to care. I knew that look in her eyes. She was eager to get to bed.

I let Rosie rest her eyes for a moment as I double checked our outside surroundings. To my relief, the street was clear of the scary looking Hummers and soldiers. I scanned Laurie‚Äôs property. Her porch was empty, but she was there. The smoke of a recently put out cigarette rising from her crystal ashtray clued me in. I also figured she was inside considering the power was still out on our block, yet, a faint glowing light could be seen behind her windows.¬†¬†

Presence of life was good, because that meant I could end it.

I gently tapped Rosie awake, my pointer finger pressed against my lips to let her know to be quiet. She shook her head In acknowledgment. Slowly, very slowly, I opened the door to the truck, unbuckled her seatbelt, then slid Rosie over the middle console and onto my lap, letting her jump out first. I made sure to maintain skin to skin contact the whole time, still unsure if I could keep things invisible without touching them. It was my turn to get out next. After cautiously sliding out of the driver's seat, I once again carefully shut the car door. I released my grip off the vehicle. The camouflage the blue rust bucket had been under started to dissipate.¬†

Holding hands, Rosie and I then carefully tip-toed through the yard, past my Jeep with its poor deflated tires, and into the house. As soon as we made it past the doorway, I almost dropped to the floor from exhaustion, unable to use my ability any longer.¬†

Despite looking normal on the outside, the inside of my home was in complete disarray. A rancid smelling mixture of burnt smoke and rotten eggs clung to the air. The result of the firefight between my children the night before.

Not wanting to be in there longer than I had to be, I did what we came back to the house for. Stationing Rosie on the couch for another little power nap, I ran up to her room, being mindful of the leftover puddles and my water-damaged floors, to try and grab a fresh set of clothes. Unfortunately her closet hadn‚Äôt survived the fire. I sighed, my only other option being raiding Ben‚Äôs closet. Luckily, his clothes had stayed intact. I nabbed the first things I could find, taking a pair of black basketball shorts and a white shirt.

While upstairs, I also grabbed a change of clothes for myself from my closet and the iPad my kids shared- which, by the grace of God, had mostly charged before the power cut out.¬†

Back downstairs, I woke Rosie up and brought her into the bathroom to change and clean her up. She‚Äôd been wearing that damned damp and tattered witch costume all night. I hoped she hadn‚Äôt caught a cold while hiding out in that treehouse.¬†

To make things easier on myself, I let her play with the iPad as I stripped her down and used a couple water bottles to rinse the dirt and grime off her skin and hair. I dried and brushed her hair as she stared in the mirror, disapproving of the outfit choice. The shorts fit her well enough, reaching just past about half way down her shins, and the shirt was definitely loose. I just shrugged before helping her down from the sink counter she‚Äôd been sitting on, guiding her out of the bathroom. It was my turn to clean up.

My hair went up into a high ponytail after I washed my hands and face, then I changed into jeans and a plain black sweatshirt. Taking an Advil with that last little bit of water, I left the bathroom feeling as refreshed as one could be with the night I‚Äôd had.

Ready to face the world again, Rosie and I left the house. On the way over to Laurie‚Äôs porch, I spotted a decently sized rock and picked it up. It was just the thing I needed to initiate my plan to find out where Ben was taken.¬†

‚ÄúRosie, Mommy needs you to play with your iPad, okay?‚Äù I said, sitting my daughter down on Laurie‚Äôs porch step with her back facing the front door. She nodded in understanding, opening one of her favorite fashion games.¬†

Taking a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell. Fur Elise rang out as I tightened my grasp on the rock, keeping it concealed behind my back. A couple of nerve wracking seconds later, Laurie finally answered her door. ‚ÄúL-Lisa?‚Äù She asked, surprised to see me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing-‚Äú

I cut her off, smashing the rock as hard as I could on her left temple. My rage levels had spiked off the charts. Just *looking* at her after everything that she‚Äôd caused was rage inducing. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your jaw feeling, Laurie?‚Äù

Before she could respond, her eyes rolled to the back of her head as her body fell back on the floor with a loud, satisfying, thud.¬†

The game noises coming from Rosemary‚Äôs tablet suddenly stopped ‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù She asked, concerned.

‚ÄúKeep playing your game!‚Äù I whisper-yelled, dragging Laurie‚Äôs unconscious body further back into her house.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

Did you know that in the seven years we‚Äôve been neighbors, I‚Äôve never once been inside this woman‚Äôs house before?

And yes, it‚Äôs exactly like how a mad scientist‚Äôs house would be depicted in a movie or tv-show. Stacks on stacks of paper littered around every available corner. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what type of flooring she had due to the fact that every square inch of it was covered in manila folders, each having some kind of identifying chicken scratch on them. Laurie‚Äôs living room could‚Äôve made it onto an episode of *Hoarders* with the amount of equipment and junk that had been piled up on her couch, coffee table, and around her tv stand. Though she‚Äôd turned the kitchen into some sort of makeshift lab, the only ‚Äúinhabitable‚Äù area on the first floor seemed to be the adjacent dining room. A chill ran down my spine as I shuddered to think of what the upstairs looked like.¬†

After dragging my neighbor‚Äôs limp body through the hoarder house, I propped her up on one of the back table chairs. Laurie‚Äôs head lolled to the side, her tongue falling out of her mouth. The thought that she could be dead crossed my mind. She *was* on the older side and I *had* hit her pretty hard. Then a soft moan left her mouth, indicating that she was still alive. *Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs* style, I pushed her head straight up, her tongue retreating back into her mouth as I did so.¬†

Conveniently, a bundle of red nylon had been hanging off the back of another one of the table chairs. Unraveling it, I began tying Laurie down, starting with binding her wrists to the armrests then moving on to her ankles.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMommy, can I come in yet?‚Äù Rosemary called from the front door impatiently, a bored expression displayed on her face as her iPad dangled by her knees.¬†

Turning away from the door, a light groan left my lips as I rubbed my eyes until stars enveloped my vision. ‚ÄúGive me just a second, sweetie,‚Äù I answered.¬†

After making sure Laurie‚Äôs bindings were secure, I drug a chair out of the dining room, placing it right outside the doorway on the living room side. After a quick check to make sure no military prowlers were roaming the streets looking to pick up any stray super children, I ushered my daughter inside the house and guided her to her seat.

From the dining room, Laurie began to stir. My heart started racing, it wouldn‚Äôt be long until she woke up. Not wanting Rosie to hear any of what was about to ensue, I dug my earbuds and phone out of my pockets, quickly opening my music app and pulling up the last playlist that was on before. Once the earbuds were in, Rosie happily started kicking her feet to the rhythm of T*he Offspring‚Äôs* ‚ÄúThe Kids Aren‚Äôt Alright‚Äù while she continued to innocently play on her tablet.

I didn‚Äôt have time to change it from my playlist back to a kid friendly one, okay? At least she was facing away from our neighbor that I had tied up in the kitchen.

God, I‚Äôm a bad mother.

My attention turned back to the dining room. The noises coming out of Laurie‚Äôs mouth becoming more frequent, so I made a quick trip to the kitchen and filled up a random cup I‚Äôd found with cold tap water.¬†

Deciding to speed up the process, most of the water in the cup was dumped on to the mad scientist‚Äôs head and lap.¬†

‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù Laurie asked breathlessly, looking around frantically as the icy water shocked her system awake. She soon discovered that I had tied her up, beginning to squirm and tug at her binds all while looking at me with wide, terrified eyes. All that movement had irritated her head wound, causing Laurie to wince in pain.

Narrowing my seething eyes, I splashed the leftover water in the cup at her, making sure to hit that angry looking cut on her temple.¬†

She cried out a strained, guttural groan, beginning to tremble something fierce. ‚ÄúP-please don‚Äôt hurt me! I‚Äôm- I‚Äôm about to become a very rich person,‚Äù she laughed out nervously. ‚ÄúWhat do you want? I can get you money, drugs, *power*, anything!‚Äù¬†

Fishing the rock from earlier out of my pocket, I began to toss it up and down catching it in the palm of my hand. Laurie‚Äôs eyes followed the object a couple times as confusion swirled within them. Then, I willed the chunk of Earth to stay in the air. Slowly turning my wrist to the left, the atoms and minerals that made up the stone separated, leaving behind tiny particles that twinkled as the dim light above the table reflected off of them. Flicking my wrist to the right returned the rock back to its original state. I then let the mass gently fall back into my palm. ‚ÄúNo thanks, I already have power. I suppose I have you to thank for that, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Laurie said. Her whole demeanor changed from that scared old lady that was pleading for her life just a moment ago to one of indifference. The act was up. ‚ÄúYou ate a lollipop, didn‚Äôt you, Lisa?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm,‚Äù I answered, crossing my arms into my chest. ‚ÄúSo did my children, and as you can see, one of them is missing. Where‚Äôd they take my son, Laurie?‚Äù

The sudden military presence had Laurie‚Äôs scent all over it.¬†

She sighed, adjusting herself in her wet clothes. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, that‚Äôs the one thing I can‚Äôt give you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting out of here until I do.‚Äù

Laurie took a second to mull it over. ‚ÄúFine. See that radio over there?‚Äù She nodded her chin towards the end of the table where a small black radio sat across from me. I hadn‚Äôt noticed it there before. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you come over here and give it to me? With one click of that red button, I can tell my men that you‚Äôre looking for your son. They can take you *right* to him.‚Äù

Involuntarily, my nose turned up at her in disgust. ‚ÄúNice try, but I‚Äôm not an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù My neighbor then bellowed out a deranged laugh, ‚Äúbecause you were stupid enough to give your kids one of my lollipops!‚Äù

I saw red. Before I could think, my hand was gliding across the skin of her right cheek, leaving a satisfying burn on my palm. With how hard I‚Äôd smacked her, I must‚Äôve given her a concussion, definitely a bruise that would take quite some time to heal.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really going to do this?‚Äù Laurie asked, still giggling even after spitting out some blood. ‚ÄúWith your daughter just in the other room? What kind of example are you setting for her?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of example are you setting by giving *children* dangerous superpowers?‚Äù I snapped back angrily. Reacting to my emotions, the ground beneath us started to shake, causing the lights to sway and items all around the house to fall to the floor.¬†

Rosie yelped from the other room. The sound caused my heart to ache. Immediately the trembles stopped as I ran to check on my daughter. For the most part she was okay, just a little rattled up by the house shaking.

Something then clattered behind me. Returning to the dining room, I found Laurie still sitting in her chair. Her knuckles were white as she held onto the chair arms for dear life, looking at me like I could collapse the roof on her any minute. The best part was that, for the moment, she was silent.

I chalked the noise up to be another piece of loose debris and used this opportunity to make my point crystal clear, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fucking worry about my kid. This is between you and me. Now, I‚Äôm going to ask you again, where is Ben?‚Äù

The silence only lasted for a minute before that grating voice of hers started up again. ‚ÄúAll you need to know is that his life is now being dedicated to pursuing a better future for humanity.‚Äù¬†

I felt anger start to bubble up in my gut again. Then, a wicked smile spread on my lips as something interesting came to mind.

‚ÄúDo you want to know what‚Äôs funny, Laurie?‚Äù I asked, closing my eyes, listening to the earth around us.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She indulged me.

The elements that made up our bodies hummed at the same frequency, singing an enchanting song only I could hear. With a deep concentration, I started sorting through the melody, searching for just the right note. ‚ÄúFundamentally, us humans are all made from the same Earth. We all rely on the same minerals and vitamins to keep our bodies alive‚Ä¶‚Äù

My dear neighbor just looked at me, staring into my eyes to see if she could decipher what the hell I was getting at. With a snap of my fingers, it wouldn‚Äôt be too long until she figured it out.

Laurie suddenly doubled over as much as she could as an intensely painful sensation filled her side. She opened her mouth but only choked gasps managed to escape.

‚ÄúKidney stones are at the top of the list of the most painful conditions that a human being can experience. So you see with this ability of mine, I can make it so the minerals and salt in your kidneys crystallize in an instant‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm cooking up a good big one for you now!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúO-okay! Okay!‚Äù Laurie groaned out through gritted teeth, giving me one nasty scowl. ‚ÄúEnough‚Ä¶‚Äù

A delighted expression formed on my face, not expecting her to crumble that fast. I eased up on the kidney stone, ‚ÄúReady to tell me where my son is now, bitch?‚Äù

Laurie then let out a throaty laugh. ‚ÄúEnough playing games. I‚Äôve had my fun.‚Äù

Rosie screamed from the other room as the front door was suddenly kicked open. A soldier pointing an automatic rifle at my daughter burst through the door. The sound of glass shattering in the kitchen revealed another gunman had broken in from the back door. In an instant he had the barrel of the gun trained on me. Frantically, I looked for the radio that had been on the table. It was gone and we were surrounded.

‚ÄúH-how?‚Äù I stammered out, trying to think of a way out of this. I tried to take a step back to my Rosie, but that resulted in both guns safety being switched off.¬†

‚ÄúOh neighbor, you‚Äôre not the only adult here who ate a lollipop!‚Äù

‚Äú*You!?!*‚Äù

Laurie scoffed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sound so surprised, Lisa. I *am* a mad scientist after all. An even madder one now that I‚Äôve developed an amplified intelligence!‚Äù

Now it was my turn to laugh, ruefully. ‚ÄúYou experimented and risked your life, my *children‚Äôs* lives, f-for what?! The off chance you might‚Äôve been granted a superpower. You‚Äôre absolutely insane!

‚ÄúWith science comes sacrifice,‚Äù was all she said, calmly. Too calm. She still had one more trick hidden under her sleeve. I could tell, it was a look Rosemary had given me many times when she was being naughty.¬†

‚ÄùThere was a reason I told you not to eat my candy,‚Äù Laurie began to explain, proving my point. ‚ÄúThrough my experimentation I came to learn why children were the ideal candidates to ingest my serum. It all comes down to one simple reason, they would be the easiest to control, only developing one superpowered neural pathway. Adults on the other hand can and will develop multiple, which makes controlling and creating an army more difficult. If started off young we can break, train, and guide these children to become the best soldiers this planet has ever seen by adulthood.‚Äù

My knees went weak as I understood the weight of her words. Knowing now what she planned on doing to my kids and why they got one power while I got two.

If adults get more than one power, case in point, and Laurie already told me she got super smarts after taking that serum, then‚Ä¶

Suddenly, I was grabbed from behind, my wrists forced together as the back of my knee was kicked in. A hand forced my chin up. I saw Laurie looking down at me. Surprising, considering in my peripheral vision Laurie had still been tied down to that chair.¬†

Super smarts and cloning were Laurie‚Äôs powers?!? *Fucking seriously?*

Before I could try to use one of my abilities, a sharp stabbing pain came from my neck as she jabbed a long needle into a vein, injecting something into my bloodstream.¬†

Whatever it was started working fast. I got extremely light headed, the end of my vision filling with inky black. The hum of the Earth started to sound dissonant compared to the symphony it usually was. My body started to feel heavy and light at the same time as I tried to fight the drug. It was like falling down a never ending abyss.¬†

‚ÄúThank you for walking right into my trap, dear. I‚Äôll have so much fun learning all about that other power you developed,‚Äù I heard Laurie whisper in my ear as my attempt to stay conscious began to fail. My eyes shut voluntarily as the sounds from the outside world began to dim. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Lisa, you‚Äôll get to see both of your kids again, I‚Äôm not a *monster* after all.‚Äù¬†

\*\*\*

I woke up to a bright light humming to life and assaulting my eyelids. My eyes blinked open, slowly adjusting to the lights. Then my last memories came rushing in.¬†

Startled, I jerked upright, finding myself in a mind-numbingly white room. Squinting down, trying to prevent myself from going blind, I discovered the clothes I woke up in were not the ones I had gone to sleep in. My outfit consisted of a pair of white long pants with a matching short sleeved v-neck. The fabric felt like scrubs. Embroidered onto the right breast was a number. *111.* Most concerning of all was the leather collar strapped to my throat that wouldn‚Äôt come off. There seemed to be some type of device attached to it.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I heard suddenly.

My head turned at the sound of that voice. It was then that I found out all the walls were made out of a strong see-through material.

‚ÄúBen!‚Äù I cried, leaping to the wall that divided me from my son. In the middle were a couple of holes to let the air in and circulate. I poked a finger through to touch him, he touched me back. Tears welled up in my eyes. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever see him again. He wore a similar outfit to mine, but with the number *110* instead. He also had that torture device strapped around his neck.

I looked to the right side of the room to find Rosie still asleep on her cot. She was in the same *uniform* as my son and I. ‚ÄúRosie, baby, are you okay?‚Äù I asked her.

Rosemary shot up from her bed at the sound of my voice. ‚ÄúMommy,‚Äù she sobbed, putting her hand up to mine from her side of the wall.

Laurie was right, I did get to see both my children again. The only downside seemed to be that we were locked in some kind of glass prison cell.¬†

A loud bang came from the other side of Ben‚Äôs room, interrupting my family‚Äôs bittersweet reunion. The cause of the disruptive noise came from none other than Jaime, who was also blind folded on top of having one of those collars around her neck too. ‚ÄúWould you keep it down, I‚Äôm trying to sleep!‚Äù

A pair of women‚Äôs heels suddenly sounded out, coming from down the hallway. Ben and Jaime immediately went rigid upon hearing whoever those footsteps belonged to.

The suspense grew as they got louder the closer they came to our cells. Rosie and I looked at each other nervously, not knowing what to expect. I did my best to give her a reassuring nod. ‚ÄúAs long as we‚Äôre together, we can do anything,‚Äù I whispered to her. I looked at Ben and conveyed the same message.¬†

‚Äú109, 110,‚Äù A feminine voice acknowledged Ben and Jaime, passing them by.¬† A small, mousy woman then appeared in front of my cell. She wore dark brown pants that flared out at the bottoms, paired with a tan button up, all worn under a pristinely white lab coat. Her dirty blonde hair had been styled up in a bun, a few strands left loose to function as faux bangs. She carried a clipboard with her.¬†

‚ÄúGood morning subjects 111, 112, my name is Dr. Howard, but you can call me Ainsley! I understand your bodies are going through some major changes that are quite confusing, but fear not.

In the confines of Mark and Ral'vok's cabin, the dim light cast a warm glow over the trio sitting on the floor. Ral'vok, with her coarse mane of hair spilling over her shoulders, gently stroked Vithrax's soft, webbed feet. The semi-aquatic Osi shivered in delight, his large blue eyes blinking slowly as he leaned into her touch. Avis, an android of steel and artificial flesh, sat on one of the beds, humming quietly to herself. The door slid open, and Mark entered, balancing two cups and a bowl of coffee designed specifically for Vithrax.

""Hey, everyone!"" Mark said, setting the cups down beside them. ""I brought some drinks. How's it going?""

Ral'vok looked up, her yellow eyes gleaming with curiosity. ""Mark, we were just discussing how humans treat some inanimate objects as if they were alive. What is the reason for this?""

Vithrax tilted his head, his voice a soft buzz. ""Humans... make objects feel alive?""

Mark chuckled as he settled down beside them, taking a sip from his cup. ""Kind of. We call it anthropomorphizing. It's when we assign names, human traits or emotions to objects. It can be comforting to us or just plain silly.""

""What is silly?"" Vithrax asked, his curiosity piqued.

Ral'vok chimed in, ""He speaks of the Roomba named 'Stabby.' What is this?""

Mark leaned back, a grin spreading across his face. ""Oh, Stabby the Roomba is a classic. Someone thought it would be funny to tape a knife to a Roomba and let it roam free. It doesn‚Äôt serve any purpose other than to make people laugh, really.""

Vithrax's eyes widened. ""Dangerous machine. Why create?""

""It‚Äôs all about the humor of it. But it‚Äôs not just Roombas. Humans often name their weapons, paint faces on their machines, and sometimes even give nicknames to their kitchen appliances. There‚Äôs a certain charm to it,"" Mark said, chuckling.

""You name your weapons?"" Ral'vok asked, tilting her head, intrigued.

Mark nodded. ""Sure! Some people call their guns things like ‚ÄòBetsy‚Äô or ‚ÄòOld Reliable.‚Äô It‚Äôs a way to create a connection to the objects we use. Makes them feel... more personal, you know? In some cases it helps us take care of our things better, which works out well if said things require a lot of maintenance.""

Avis interjected with a soft, melodic voice. ""Humans have an innate desire to connect with their environment. This anthropomorphism allows for a more relatable interaction with technology.""

Ral'vok turned to Avis, fascinated. ""You understand this?""

""Yes,"" Avis replied with a bright smile. ""It allows for emotional engagement, especially in situations that can be dangerous or stressful. Some humans even absent‚Äîmindedly talk to their tools, like asking their weapon not to fail them, for example. It makes the experience more enjoyable.""

""Exactly!"" Mark said, clearly pleased with Avis's input. ""It‚Äôs all about bonding with our tools and machines. Some pilots even name their ships. It's a way to personalize the experience and express individuality, too.""

Vithrax blinked, his webbed feet tapping lightly on the floor. ""Do you have names for your machines, Mark?""

Mark laughed softly. ""I do! My motorbike is called ‚ÄòThumper.‚Äô It‚Äôs loud and powerful, like a heartbeat. It‚Äôs a part of who I am, you could say.""

Ral'vok grinned, her eyes sparkling. ""Strange, but I... I see the appeal. Connecting to something you use, in a way.""

""Yup,"" Mark agreed. ""It‚Äôs part of what makes us human. We find joy in the absurd, and sometimes, that‚Äôs what keeps us going.""

Vithrax nodded slowly. ""Strange. But understand. I like this.""

Ral'vok leaned forward, her excitement palpable. ""Tell us more about Stabby. What else do humans create for humor?""

Mark took another sip of his coffee, ready to share more stories of the absurdity of human creativity. ""You think Stabby was awesome? Wait till you hear about Deadeye Toasty‚Äîa toaster my first crew built to launch toast directly at their faces‚Ä¶""

Would like to trade pix early on to be sure there‚Äôs an attraction. I want to help you fulfill that butterfly feeling you‚Äôre lacking. Those firsts. Learning about each other. Turning each other on. The list goes on. Pandora‚Äôs box has been opened and I want to help you explore it. Leaning more towards a physical relationship. Attraction is a must so feel free to send a SFW pic. Please have a good sense of humor, and don‚Äôt just say you do and then get offended (lol). Be close NC to make meeting in person a goal.

So...no age listed in the title or body, but he's looking for a woman 26-41.5. Let's play the guessing game - how old do we think he is? 40? 50? 60? Oh, bonus ""leaves comments on 20-something thirstposts""

# 39 [M4F] #Boston - Tall, bearded, well endowed and potentially seeking a throat to borrow

>First, about me: I'm a down to earth dude who's much closer to the South Shore than Boston. I'm 39, 6'4, 225. The ever infamous ""tall, bearded, dad bod type"" you love to hate. Or hate that you actually love it. Something along those lines.. For the 90s girls who had a crush on David Duchovny, I'm up your alley. Maybe not on the looks but definitely for the swag.

>Where do you fit into this? Historically, I've gotten along best with women I find attractive who have good senses of humor, who aren't shy or unresponsive, and who are kind. I like petite and health-conscious women, but I'm also a fan of curvy women. I don't put blanket restrictions because I'd rather let our interaction and impression inform us if we're into each other.

>Let's chat. Bonus points if you're inexperienced, an alt girl, and or married/attached..because y'all are ethereal.

He likes petite, but *also* curvy. He wants inexperienced, but also married/attached. This guy is all over the place...I hope he finds the throat he's looking for. No, wait, forget that last part.

# 46 [M4F] #Florida married looking for younger trouble maker : )

>Married latin m 46 from S Florida. Easy chill dad bod. Seeking a very open minded friend to chat and see where this goes. This is for a fun friendship maybe more. Chemistry is important \*\*\*

>No smokers no drugs. Open minded looking to try new things. Must also like going on road trips, the beach, ocean gaming, coffee shops, kayaking as well. Must like dressing up in cute kinky outfits. Tattoos piercings a plus. Please be in the south Florida area. 18 to 30 only

Really, these shouldn't even qualify at this point. Also, if he's in Southern Florida, doesn't he have more important things to worry about right now?

i dont know how to explain it, but i have days where im super productive (and not resting which burns me out), and then the subsequent burn out days. but when im burnt out, i feel like time just skips. 

i'll wake up late, get a coffee or something, then in the blink of an eye im suddenly in bed, it's nighttime, and i'm scrolling on my phone.

im definitely not like blacking out, but it feels like the day goes by and i have to be like ""wait, what did i do today?"" because im so tired and fatigued and just lost. 

it also happens with hyperfixations. like i'll start something new and then a few days later be like ""how did i get here and why am i suddenly the expert at this hobby? do i even like this?"" and i feel like i lose all sense of identity.

i think it coincides with stressful periods of my life. im under stress right now (nothing crazy, but i get overwhelmed easily with decision making and there are a lot of important decisions in my life right now) and i think ive just been on autopilot.

1g1cle8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1g1cle8/is_my_friendship_gone/,Is my friendship gone?,"Right, so this is the first post I've written on here besides commenting on other people's posts. Please bare with me.

So when I was in secondary school I only had 1 friend who I hung out with for 6 years. We were best friends in school. There was a 3rd person who joined us for a couple of years then she moved away again, so then it was just the two of us again.

My friend developed the goth side of her image and personality. Dyed her hair black,  listened to goth music and talked about Marilyn Manson all the time. It didn't matter to me who she was, because that became her identity. She was who she was, I loved who she was because she was my best friend. I'm entirely the opposite, I was a theatre nerd. I listened to musicals. We were like chalk and cheese. But we were friends and made each other laugh every day. We had a strong friendship in school.

Since we both left school, we went our separate ways such as going to different colleges and we studied different sectors. But we still kept in touch. 

Fast forward many years into adulthood - When I got engaged in 2013 I invited her to my wedding reception in August 2015. She declined and her reason for it was that she ""didn't know what she was doing"". She ALWAYS saod this whenever I wanted to go for coffee with her and catch up. All she ever did was watch horror films and draw. She never wanted to meet up with me and it was hurtful. We fell out.

She then moved down South and we got back in touch. Moving on to this year. I now have a daughter who is 7 years old and my friend and I had been talking in WhatsApp, she would show me photos of her cats, I was always interested in what she was doing and about her life. She would always message me about some guy that wants to go for coffee with her. I replied to those messages because I consider myself a good friend. I listened to her.
However, I messaged her 2 months ago asking g what she was up to and if she had any plans that weekend...no answer. I then message again a week later the same thing...no answer. Basically I've messaged her about 12 times since the date of my 9th wedding anniversary, and I have heard diddlysquat from her, even though she has taken the time to unlock her phone, open the message and read it. I've asked if she's OK, if she's safe, if something has happened or is her phone has been stolen and I'm still not getting and answer.
I even went to lengths of messaging her dad on Facebook to ask if she's alright. The bloke doesn't even know who I am as I've never met him. Ice asked her dad the same things I've asked her as I'm worried that something has actually happened.

But what else is going through my head is that she doesn't want to be my friend anymore because I'm not a goth. 

I just wish I knew what the problem is. Is it me?

I can't move on from this until I have a bit of closure. Just a wee message is all I would like.

I started the audiobook on Spotify a few weeks ago and took my time listening to it. I finally finished it yesterday and as the world's biggest skeptic, I can honestly say this has been my saving grace. I previously relied on patches or inhalers to ""quit"" smoking and then wondered why I always went back to smoking after continuing to feed the addiction, and not really dealing with the problem.
Anyway, I digress. This morning was hard for me. I dreamt about smoking, poured my coffee, and couldn't get the thought out of my mind. I was a little irritable, but nothing compared to how I would normally feel with a real ""withdrawal"" or ""craving"".

This is a repost of a post that I made on another reddit, and I came here to ask for the perspective of women specifically.

I needed to get something off my chest. So my girlfriend recently started pursuing her Master's degree and she's been busy making friends and I am very happy for her. She hangs out and parties with a group of guys, and a few girls, from university and I never really thought anything of it. However, before she went out last saturday, I asked her if any of the guys hit on her, and she was initially a little bit dismissive, but then she admitted that one of them asked if she had a boyfriend. Of course, she said yes. The dude replied something like: ""Ah too bad. I was asking everyone in class if you were single. And by the way, I am not the only one from class that was wondering if you are single."" Her reply was that she didn't want me to get worried or paranoid that's why she didn't tell me.

Therefore, I was a bit annoyed when she went out with that guy (and the rest of the group) last weekend, but I wished her a fun time nonetheless. I partied with girls during my time in uni, so it would have been hypocritical of me to assume the worst. Everything went fine, she texted me throughout the night saying how she missed me, and that I do not have to be paranoid about anything. I go to sleep and lo and behold, I wake up to a text from her saying that that guy stayed the night, because he messed up the train schedule and would have had to wait an hour before being able to catch the next train back home. She said: ""It was 6am and the next one would have departed at 7am, and he was cold, so I offered him my place. Yes we slept in the same bed, and I know that this is probably coincidental (in your head) that its him, but he is just a friend and it means nothing and I do not want you to worry. I love you baby"".

Here's why I think this is ridiculous:

1. They left the party at 05:00. They arrived at the train station at 05:15, ish. The first train that that guy needed to take left at 05:22. The four of them ate a quick snack at the station, chilled for 30 minutes, and then supposedly left to go home. The guy, and my girlfriend, said there were no more trains after that because they checked the app and there was nothing. I checked both google and the local app, and there CLEARLY was another train at 06:22. He would have had to wait 30 minutes max to hop on the next train, which is nothing in my opinion. My girlfriend suggested, apparently, that he'd join her in the Uber to her station to see if there was another train leaving from there. There was. They arrived at 06:15, and the next train was scheduled for 06:45. Again, dude would have just had to wait for another 30 minutes to get home. She keeps being adamant that neither of them saw the trains scheduled and that she thought he would have to wait for an entire hour, but this is complete bullshit, I checked the apps myself.
2. You don't just miss a bunch of trains. The rest of the group that was from the same city as that guy left at 4AM. Surely, at one point during the night, you check what your options are to get home? I really do not believe that these things catch you by surprise. Especially considering how accessible and transparent public transportation is in my country.
3. She could have offered him a cup of coffee and told him to chill in the common area of her building. She even could have offered him the couch in the common area and given him a pillow. Instead, she offers her bed to him. I think this is extremely bizar and I really do not know what to think of this.
4. She'd known this guy for literally two weeks and this was the second party they went to. She hates sleeping with other people.

Her initial reactions were: ""Sleeping together does not mean SLEEPING TOGETHER"" and ""I would have done this for any other person"". Only after her friends told her how fucked up it was did she realise her mistake, allegedly. When I saw her face to face she apologised profusely and swore that nothing happened and she got super nervous. Even the guy told her the next morning that he wouldn‚Äôt have been too happy if he was in my shoes. This has been a topic for the last week and a half and yesterday she freaked out, like going ballistic, acusing me of messing with her peace of mind and that she would refuse to talk about this topic anymore.

To be honest, I feel like I am going crazy and that I am missing the obvious and I don't know what to think or believe anymore.

For those of you who are starting fasting: it's baby steps. If you are just getting into intermittent fasting, and don't want to drink coffee black, I suggest adding monkfruit sweetener (0 cal, 0 carb, NATURAL sweetener), and if u rlly cant go without it I suggest adding a small amount of half and half or heavy cream. Milk has a higher carb amount than cream, and has the potential to raise insulin levels which is a fat storage hormone. 

I say if adding a tiny amount of cream in your coffee helps you fast throughout the rest of your window, I do not see the issue. Personally, I have a problem with binge/restricting. Adding some cream in my coffee significantly helps me not to binge later on. You can still lose a significant amount of weight that way. 

However, if you fast for cell repair or other health benefits, you would have to be truly fasting and skip the cream as at the CELLULAR level, your organs and other systems would not be fully taking a break. 

Alternatively, consider switching to green tea or other caffeinated teas with monkfruit. I would say it's a game changer for me, personally. ",6,1728660516.0,intermittentfasting,4,0.67,False

I was served by a deadman at a private event, so I tried it. It seemed to be a dark beer.

However, it seems like there is a bit of coffee.

Now when I looked at the photo, I realized it was espresso stout (concentrated dark beer), which is very special. Not as bitter as guiness, but more coffee flavor.

2. You don't just miss a bunch of trains. The rest of the group that was from the same city as that guy left at 4AM. Surely, at one point during the night, you check what your options are to get home? I really do not believe that these things catch you by surprise. Especially considering how accessible and transparent public transportation is in my country.
3. She could have offered him a cup of coffee and told him to chill in the common area of her building. She even could have offered him the couch in the common area and given him a pillow. Instead, she offers her bed to him. I think this is extremely bizar and I really do not know what to think of this.
4. She'd known this guy for literally two weeks and this was the second party they went to. She hates sleeping with other people.

Her initial reactions were: ""Sleeping together does not mean SLEEPING TOGETHER"" and ""I would have done this for any other person"". Only after her friends told her how fucked up it was did she realise her mistake, allegedly. When I saw her face to face she apologised profusely and swore that nothing happened and she got super nervous. Even the guy told her the next morning that he wouldn‚Äôt have been too happy if he was in my shoes. This has been a topic for the last week and a half and yesterday she freaked out, like going ballistic, acusing me of messing with her peace of mind and that she would refuse to talk about this topic anymore.

***P.O.V. AX3L***

***\[Alarm, 07:00 A.M.\]***

As my alarm notified me, the sun is almost in view. It‚Äôs time to start the day!

I get closer to User Walker, trying to see if he‚Äôs in a good state to be woken up. Mmmh, strange, he seems to not be recovering well, he also seems to be in some pain.

""uuuuh"" yeah no, those little grunts of pain just confirmed that something isn‚Äôt right. I should give him a quick check, but it might drain my energy supply to too low a level to be useful, and I need it to assist my User because although I trust him, I don't really trust his bodily functions. I mean, have you seen how the human body functions? It really makes you understand how inferior evolution is in the face of bioengineering.

But since we no longer have the availability to use it we have to content ourselves with the standard body of a human, as faulty as it is. Since i can‚Äôt use the superiority of medical technology, I have to use‚Ä¶eye evaluation ***\[\*Shivers.exe***\****\]***. Damn it, a cybernetic caretaker like me shouldn‚Äôt lower themself like this, at least the others aren‚Äôt here or I would lose my Digital Entity Books Club card, I'm only 50 years away from having an eternity membership card!

Wait AX3l, this is for the wellbeing of the user! Okay, I have to calm down.

***\[Calm.exe initialized\]***

***P.O.V. Walker***

I dreamt of that night, you know? The night when I betrayed everyone at the monastery. AX3L told me I was 1 week old when he brought me there. After all, amazing as he is, he couldn't just take care of me all by himself and since my parents tried to launch me off a cliff not even an hour after my birth, he could only find help there.

Honestly, life there wasn't bad at all. I had good friends, decent food, the monks were really sweet people and when I talked to AX3L they simply thought I had an imaginary friend. Which made what I did even more unforgivable.

‚Äú......ssssssssshiiiiiiiittt‚Äù are the only things I can say while waking up. I knew that sleeping on a ship was terrible, but I didn't think it was as bad as sleeping on rocks. I know I said to Lyr-sorry, \*Captain\* Lyra that I didn't need to sleep, but for fuck sake even an undead should at least have a decent bed. I mean, it's true that I lied about being an undead but I think having a bad bed is a huge indicator of having neither a life nor self-respect, 2 things that undead are mostly known for.

Rant aside, I should check what the tim-\*BOOM\*. I feel an explosion going off with enough force to make me fall off the bed, ‚ÄúHOLY-‚Äù is the only thing I can exclaim before violently kissing the floor. Fortunately I didn't just pass out from the impact, BUT IT DEFINITELY HURT LIKE SHIT!

As I slowly get up, I try to assess the situation. Did someone attack us? But this zone was rendered pirate-free for YEARS! The probability of this being a pirate attack are slim to none, SO WHAT THE FU-.

‚ÄúI see that someone's finally up.‚Äù WHO THE- it's the captain, and she's calm, WHY IS SHE CALM?! I try to recompose myself and stand up, but unfortunately I CAN'T BE CALM! Once I'm finally on my feet I try to ask questions in the most chill tone I can muster at the moment ‚Äú...Sorry Captain but I must ask: THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!‚Äù

I see her calmly sipping her cup of coffee like I didn't just ask her why the ship exploded. I know I'm exaggerating but THAT WAS A BIG FUCKING EXPLOSION! So forgive me for being a little rude. After sipping her coffee without a care in the world she finally answers ‚ÄúOh, it was breakfast. Since the rest of my crew is waiting at the next port, because you said that there wasn't time to waste and we needed to set sail as fast as we could‚Äù She then sips her coffee a little more, to try to make me feel guilty. Well I'm sorry but I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THAT AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE THE FUCK DOES BREAKFAST HAVE TO DO WITH BIG EXPLOSIONS?!

‚ÄúOh right, you probably don't know this but the Orks of the mountains of Kadoon usually put gunpowder on their breakfasts, and guess where Derek was born?‚Äù ‚Ä¶that, that's just‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS STUPID!‚Äù

She shrugs ‚ÄúMaybe, but that's still his culture. Which reminds me, what do you eat for breakfast?‚Äù ‚Ä¶damn it, she's suspicious, I have to come up with something! What do undeads eat-wait a minute. Oh, I'm stupid. ‚ÄúOh, this must be the first time you encountered a real undead but you see, we don't eat so don't worry about me!‚Äù

Alright, apart from her scary red eyes that are no doubt judging me, I should have been able to at least be convincing enough for her‚Ä¶maybe I should add something to make things less weird. ‚ÄúOh don't worry, it's ok to not know something, especially when you haven't had the pleasure to interact with them in person. If you want or need to know something about the undead don't worry and just ask me, it's always nice to help!‚Äù

Good, that should make her mad enough to not question my response. Now, let's see what her reaction is!

***P.O.V. Captain Lyra***

This guy is SO full of shit, he could compete with the bathroom. For Celeste's sake, I knew this guy was shady at best, but him trying to play it off like this just pisses.me.OFF!

‚Ä¶But he did pay me enough to let it slide. Still, I can't help but doubt his status as an undead. I know for sure his heart isn‚Äôt beating, I cast a medical spell to see as much! And the absence of hair at least corroborates the possibility of stopped growth. He‚Äôs pale as a ghost, he doesn‚Äôt want to eat and he‚Äôs a dick, all qualities that an undead should have. And yet, why do I feel like he's hiding something from me?

Maybe I'm just too suspicious, but my instincts have never let me down. \*Sigh\* For the moment I should just ignore him and focus on the mission. Alright Lyra, put on your dumb face.

""Oh REALLY\~? I didn‚Äôt know about that\~, I‚Äôm so sorry\~, I‚Äôll try not to disturb you anymore\~"" After doing this annoying voice on purpose I sip some more coffee, this time more loudly, to annoy him further. Hey, just because I have to be nice to him doesn‚Äôt mean I can't annoy him a little!

‚Äú...Well, don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù he says, trying to not show his frustration at my response. I guess he was trying to make me mad, although I don't understand why?

‚ÄúWell, have a good day\~‚Äù I say as I close the door. Now, it‚Äôs better if I go towards the kitchen. Derek's eating habits are strange for sure, but even he knows to not make the kitchen explode like that! \*sigh\* I just hope that he didn‚Äôt break the kitchen, again.

***P.O.V. AX3L***

***\[Notification: Calm.exe Finalized, Emotional Status = Calm, Time used = 5 Minutes\]***

Oh jolly, what a beautiful day! Now that I have calmed down I can finally do thi-why is User Walker sitting on his bed like a depressed teenager?¬†

***\[Warning: User Walker in agitated state\]***

Oh, oooooooh, I see. I thought we already solved this issue when he was 14! Well, the human psyche IS redundantly weird, so this was probably just a matter of time.

I deactivate my invisibility and slowly sit by my User side.

***\[Calming\_voice.exe activated\]***

‚ÄúGood morning User, is something on your mind?‚Äù I try not to get to the core of the problem immediately, it's better to try that only in the most dire of situations.

Mmmmh, no response, maybe it's better if I try to get closer to the issue. ‚ÄúOh my User, is something on your mind? Or someone?‚Äù Let's see if he responds. Good, he nodded with the head, that means that my hypothesis was correct. Now, how do I approach him about his sexual feelings about the elf Lyra?

I mean, obviously this agitated state was created by it, probably a wet dream? Still, I should discourage him from trying to have a relationship with her, or anyone for that matter! The mission comes first! Besides, since he's what the people of this world call a changeling, the relationship is impossible either way!

Now, let's see why my User would find her attractive!

***\[Personal Profiles: Captain Lyra.***

***Estimated Age: 60 years(since elf's life expectancy doubles that of a human, she's probably in her 30s by elf‚Äôs standards);***

***Physical Description: she has red eyes, white hair, a very toned musculature and a tall body(in other words, how you would describe a captainy-looking captain);***

***Psychological Evaluation: Still pending.***

***Match with User: 10%\]***

Just as I thought, it‚Äôs just the hormones. I must get User Walker on the right path! ‚ÄúUser Walker, I know what is on your mind!‚Äù he looks at me with an awkward look and speaks before I can continue with my 12 step program to lose interest with someone, how rude! ‚ÄúSORRY AX3L, I KNEW¬† THAT I SHOULDN‚ÄôT HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE CAPTAIN BUT I STILL DID AND NOW SHE‚ÄôS ON OUR ASS!‚Äù

***\[PANIC.exe initiated\]***

HOLY SHIIIT! ‚ÄúHOW DID THAT HAPPENED!? I WAS BLACKED OUT FOR 5 MINUTES‚Äù ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT KNOW! I WAS SIMPLY TALKING TO HER, BUT I MUST HAVE SAID TOO MUCH AND NOW SHE'S DEFINITELY SUSPICIOUS!‚Äù

FOR CIRCUITS AND BOLTS THIS IS A CATASTROPH-***\[WARNING: CPU reaching critical heat levels, forced reboot initiated\]***

***‚Ä¶***

***‚Ä¶***

***\[Reboot complete, time used = 1 minute\]***

Alright, I just got what in human terms could be described as a heart attack but I'm now calmer.

And, since I did a complete reboot, I am now in Walker's arms since my levitation got shut off. Fortunately I'm the shape of a sphere 50 cm in diameter, so it isn't too much of a hassle for my favorite protagonist to carry me, although he is in a panic with teary eyes.

‚ÄúI'm so sorry User Walker, I was forced to reboot completely but now that I'm calmer I thought of a way to see if your fears are true or not!‚Äù At my proposed solution he seems to calm down and wipes off the tears from his face ‚Äúreally?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, really! I will follow her through the ship to understand if she knows more than she should. This way I can also grab something for you to eat!‚Äù

***\[Levitation activated\]***

I start once again to levitate, I almost bolted upstairs before remembering that I should at least ask the User if they need something. I look towards him and ask ‚ÄúNow I'm gonna go, need anything?‚Äù He thinks about it for a few seconds before answering ‚ÄúActually, could you go check the kitchen? I heard an explosion 5 minutes ago and the Captain said that it was the Ork‚Äôs breakfast, but I'm still skeptical, so could you please go and check?‚Äù An explosion? In the kitchen? Ork breakfast?

***\[Sigh.exe\]***

This journey is only in the beginning phase and I'm already tired. Well, this was the best we could get to be brought to our destination, so I can't exactly complain. OH RIGHT! THE COMPLAINT OF THE USER!

‚ÄúSorry User, but I MUST do a medical checkup on you! Please, undress yourself immediately!‚Äù

***P.O.V. Walker***

I would be lying if I said that AX3L request didn't weird me out at first, after all I saw him do medical a checkup before WITHOUT having to undress the patient, but after the explaining that he's on low battery I can see why it has to be this way. So I undress and let AX3L do a checkup. ‚ÄúMmmmh, let's see: the head is still shaved, and from what I can see it doesn't seem to have any visible injuries; The fake elf ears seem operational, although given the fact that they‚Äôre in low energy mode i can only send you Alarms, 1 word messages and VERY low resolution images, plus all the additional functions are disabled. It‚Äôs good that at least the most bearbone features are still functional, without them we would have been discovered last night‚Äù

‚ÄúEyes still in good health, unfortunately we don‚Äôt have the equipment to test your eyesight at the moment; The Abdomen seems to be good, although there are many bruises; Now let‚Äôs look at your back-DAAAAAAMN!‚Äù huh? What's the problem? Do I have a wound on my back? ‚ÄúAX3L, what happened? Do i have an inju-‚Äù ‚ÄúUSER YOU HAVE THE END OF A KNIFE STUCK IN YOUR BACK!‚Äù ‚ÄúWHAT?!?! HOW!?!?‚Äù ‚ÄúUSER, HOW THE F***\[audio error\]*** DID YOU NOT NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE A KNIFE ON YOUR BACK!?‚Äù ‚ÄúI, UH‚Ä¶mmmh, yeah, I don‚Äôt know, I just don‚Äôt feel any pain honestly‚Äù ‚Äú...S***\[audio error\]***, alright, you must remain here while I try to see what I can find/do, understood?‚Äù I nod, not having that much of a choice in the matter really.

I lie down on my bed, face down as to AX3L request. While he goes i try to remember how the fuck did i get a BROKEN KNIFE on my back, since there were NONE in the temple, of that I made sure. Maybe it was put there while we were sailing? No. I may have been incredibly sleep deprived but I should have been able to feel a knife enter my body. Well, for now it‚Äôs no use trying to remember it, when AX3L finds a way to recharge himself we can check his memory.

‚ÄúHey AX3L, how do you think to actually find a way to solve this problem?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I either find a way to recharge my power source or I must find a healing spell, store it and use it on you. For the second idea I hope the captain has some spells on her sleeve, but I have no idea¬† how to actually induce her to do that! ‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll find a way regardless, so please rest for now‚Äù Having said this, he activates his invisibility and vanishes from this room. I still have no idea how he can phase through objects and not deplete his energy! Sometimes I really can't distinguish between technology and magic.

***P.O.V. Captain Lyra***

***5 minutes ago***

Alright, let‚Äôs see how much damage did Derek do to the kitchen!

I enter, expecting a hole on the side of the ship, which by the way is already not the biggest ship in general, but instead I find‚Ä¶Altair? Reading a cooking book while he and Derek are wearing aprons? What the hell? I mean, I dig the aprons but the kitchen doesn‚Äôt even seem to be damaged, only having some light, but still irritating, smoke!

‚Äú \*cough\* \*cough\* What are you two doing?‚Äù I say, having little to no tolerance for smoke. Altair only waves a hand, still focused on his book, meanwhile Derek looks directly at me ‚ÄúGood Morning Captain!‚Äù He says, while putting away his apron, apparently deciding that talking to me is more important than helping Altair cook.

‚ÄúWe were actually working on breakfast, unfortunately we didn‚Äôt realize that the eggs of phoenixes don‚Äôt really like being boiled. Fortunately they only did a little shockwave and also a little bit of smoke!‚Äù He says, with the joy that only an idiot can master.

‚ÄúI see, and what exactly were you trying to make?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe correct tense is ‚ÄòARE MAKING‚Äô my captain, and to answer your question we‚Äôre making omelets‚Äù responded Altair, unprompted. He‚Äôs always silent but when he can correct someone he‚Äôs as talkative as ever! Another reason why he‚Äôs my second in command.

‚ÄúAlright, just, please tell me next time so I can warn our guest‚Äù ‚Äúooooh right, the boy!‚Äù Says Derek, I hope he didn‚Äôt say it that way because he forgot about him ‚ÄúI completely forgot about him!‚Äù Why am I not surprised?¬†

I look at both of my crewmen and I can't help but think about the deal I made with Mr Walker. I really hate having to lie to my crew but a deal is a deal. Mr Walker‚Äôs very strange, even for an undead, although since he‚Äôs technically the only undead i ever interacted with in my life I only have my books to base his attitude.

I shake my head trying not to think about our guest, instead focusing on helping with breakfast. Derek, being the chef, is really good at preparing ingredients while also being very knowledgeable about cooking. Really the only downside to him, apart from having the brain of a fish, is that his eating habits are questionable at best, after all I wasn‚Äôt kidding about his people using gunpowder as seasoning.

Altair, although he doesn‚Äôt know anything about cooking, is at least smart enough to know how to follow a recipe. With me guiding them we make breakfast in not even 5 minutes!

Before we could sit down, Altair asked me a question ‚ÄúSo, are you going to call our guest or do you want me to call him?‚Äù I at least had the response ready for this one ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, he said that he will remain in his room for now and asked to not be disturbed. You know, monk things‚Äù

I can see confusion in his face, but he then shrugs it off saying ‚ÄúAlright, but he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs losing. After all, Phoenixes Omelets are best when they‚Äôre still hot!‚Äù \*Phew*\** I was really worried for a moment there, after all Altair IS one of the smartest in my crew but since he doesn‚Äôt know shit about monks he stays quiet about it.

Aaaaaah\~, this is why I travel at sea: Having a good sized dining room, talking with friends, eating good food and feeling the smell of the ocean! Moments like this are what I prefer, even if Derek is trying to argue with Altair about what the fact that red is the best for our little cargo ship, which by the way i named ‚ÄúPugbear‚Äù because 1) the ship is mine so they can‚Äôt retort about that and 2) Pugbears are really cute and really dangerous so it‚Äôs apt for our ship.

After last night's fight with the kraken I was exhausted so having this type of relaxing moment is really good. Aaaaaah really, no one can ruin this moment.

***P.O.V. AX3L***

Alright, I‚Äôm in the captain‚Äôs room and i have to say that this woman has a really good sense of fashion, I mean, nothing on the level of human fashion but the various paintings, clothing and weapons on the walls plus the blue theme everywhere give off a really nice kind-of-aristocratic vibe. I know, I know, I haven't forgotten about my dear protagonist don‚Äôt worry, I'm just admiring the room while I tear through it like a mad man, searching for even the slightest sign of SOMETHING that could help my User!

Damn it, I can't scan the room so I'm practically blind, there MUST be something that i can use. Let‚Äôs see: Cooking book, astronomy book, book about undeads(this one i‚Äôm making a mental note about it), route book, salary book-HOW MANY BOOKS DOES THE CAPTAIN HAVE!? Fuck, i can‚Äôt even calm down, i have to find some way to-wait! Maybe I found something: It‚Äôs an old book, not ancient, just old. It seems that it was written in owlot aka old elf language, which is good because it‚Äôs one of the only languages I can access without having to use my language scanner.

I open the book and start to read, it might take more time then a scan but at least I can read faster then normal flesh beings. Mmmmh alright so, the magic flows through here, goes into the core and then mmmmmh.

EUREKA! FOUND THE SOLUTION! My User might not like this method but this is a dire situation, plus it will allow me to recharge my energy reserves, so let‚Äôs do it!

***\[WARNING: ACTIVATING COMBAT FORM; WARNING: THIS FORM WILL BURN THROUGH THE ENERGY RESERVE, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? {Y/N} SELECTED Y; WARRIOR.EXE INITIATED, HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING\]***

***P.O.V. Captain Lyra***

Damn, that was the best meal I had in weeks! ‚ÄúAaaah, this was a nice breakfast. You know Derek, I might have been a little too mean to you these days‚Äù I can see him mid-munching looking at me like a lizard in front of a cart. He then finishes to munch and takes everything in his mouth down with a big gulp, I can almost see tiny explosions every time he munches, like the tiniest firework show ever!

""Eeeeeeer, what?‚Äù Says Derek, almost as frightened as I was when I lost my leg. Don't worry, I did go to therapy for that so I can make jokes no problem! Returning to Derek I simply look at him with a smile ‚ÄúDon't be afraid, I'm just full of good will today so I'm going to allow you to steer the ship for today, happy?‚Äù

I can see confusion in him for a good 15 seconds before he smiles excited like a child. I can see him try to thank me but I stop him immediately. ‚ÄúNo need to thank me, just don't make any stupid decisions like trying to search for the ‚Äúone blade‚Äù and simply follow the map, ok?‚Äù He immediately nods and runs out of the dining chamber. Altair looks at me with a look as if to say ‚Äòyou are a softie, admit it!‚Äô

I don't let him the satisfaction to irritate me, instead I take my plate to bring it to the kitchen sink. After putting it in the sink I look outside the window and I say to myself ‚Äúwhat a beautiful day!‚Äù

\*BOOM\*

OH COME ON, CAN'T I HAVE 5 MINUTES OF PEACE!? Since the explosion came from the deck of the ship I run towards it and as I lay my eyes on it I see Derek in full battle stance looking at something from my room-WHY IS THERE A HOLE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DOOR FOR MY ROOM!? As if to answer my question, a bolt of lightning was shot out of the room that would have definitely taken me out if I hadn't dodge it at the last second.

I immediately get battle ready, using a quick teleport spell to get my scimitar in hands, and use a spell to scan WHATEVER THE FUCK IS THE THING IN MY ROOM!

‚Ä¶N-n-no, impossible, or‚Ä¶‚ÄùDEREK, HELP ME KEEP THIS GUY DOWN! ALTAIR, GET THE CANNON!‚Äù I look at the abomination slowly walking towards us, knowing full well that this might be the time I lose another leg. After all, it's not everyday that you see a fucking Metal Deamon!

I see the little bastard walk out of my room, looking at me with an unmistakable focus. Seems like someone down there is probably pissed off at me enough to send an agent of the Deamon king itself!

The thing opens its mouth, let's see if it can really spit fi-‚Äù**\[CAPTAIN LYRA, SORRY, BUT I MUST HURT YOU!\]**‚Äù

‚Ä¶W-W-WHAT?!

And let me tell you, as a researcher who‚Äôs spent more time in Twitter than I‚Äôd like to admit, [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click) **isn‚Äôt your average memecoin.**  
  
This project, created by the enigmatic Kendu Miazaki, has carved out a slice of the memecoin world that‚Äôs fueled by unrelenting community involvement. But it's more than just folks retweeting hype posts. We‚Äôre talking about *real-life movements.* Kendu Inu‚Äôs ethos of ""We don't gamble, we work"" pulses through its veins‚Äîmanifesting as everything from startups to literal tattoos.  
  
**Let‚Äôs Start With the Tattoos.**  
  
Yes, you read that right. $KENDU‚Äôs followers have taken their conviction to the next level, with **11 tattoos** so far, including one‚Äîbrace yourself‚Äîthat reads ""**Kendu Inu**"" across someone‚Äôs *genitals*. That‚Äôs the kind of dedication I haven‚Äôt seen in my years covering crypto communities. It‚Äôs not just about ‚Äúholding‚Äù or watching price charts here‚Äî$KENDU is a lifestyle. You either *get it,* or you don‚Äôt. And if you do, it might just consume your life in the most organic, and dare I say, *healthy* way possible in this space.  
  
**Coffee? Energy Drinks? Nightlife Events? Kendu Does It All.**  
  
The community behind [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click) has built things that extend far beyond the usual memecoin antics. They've launched businesses *entirely on their own*, using [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click) as a brand canvas. **Kendu-branded coffee blends, energy drinks, a sports supplement line**, and **nightlife events** have all popped up in the last few months. And these aren‚Äôt some token side projects‚Äîthese ventures are serious.  
  
For example, the **energy drinks** have sold over 500 cans in the first week, spreading across the U.S., Canada, and Australia.   
Community members see [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click) not just as a token, but as a banner to rally under‚Äîa symbol of hard work, grit, and the relentless pursuit of something more than just short-term gains. ""**We don't gamble; we work**""‚Äîthis mantra isn‚Äôt just marketing. It‚Äôs a lived reality.  
  
**Kendu Nights: From Meme to the Dancefloor.**  
  
Another fascinating aspect? **Kendu Nights**, a nightlife brand started by the community that‚Äôs held events in Kolkata.  
You don‚Äôt see many memecoins stepping out of the digital realm and infiltrating real-world social spaces like this. But [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click), as I‚Äôve come to learn, doesn‚Äôt operate on a traditional playbook.  
  
**Is Kendu Inu Just Another Memecoin? Hell No.**  
  
The devotion to this project is unlike anything I‚Äôve seen‚Äîno paid shills, no fake pumps. It‚Äôs pure, grassroots organic marketing with members pushing the [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click) agenda not for profit but for the culture. Unlike the traditional ‚Äòmoon boys‚Äô who jump from project to project, Kendu‚Äôs members are here for the long haul, working day in and day out to build something tangible.  
  
And this isn‚Äôt just me being bullish. When I talk to the [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click) army, they make it clear that every correction is a time to work harder, to bring more value into the project. No one here is whining about the price action; instead, they‚Äôre crafting plans, hosting meetups, and literally putting ink to skin to show their loyalty‚Äã.  
  
**The Future? Well, It‚Äôs in the Hands of the Community.**  
  
So, what‚Äôs next for [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click)? More meetups are rumored, more IRL products, and possibly even MMA sponsorships‚Äã.   
As for price predictions? I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball, but I don‚Äôt need one to know that this project has something that most memecoins lack: **a soul**.  
  
If you‚Äôre sitting on the sidelines waiting for the next bull run to scoop up some [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click), you might be missing the point entirely. This isn‚Äôt just a token to trade; it‚Äôs a movement to join.  
  
So, are you ready to work?  
  
**Kendu Inu might just be the blueprint for what the next generation of memecoins should look like.** A project that has transcended speculation, grounded in real-world initiatives, powered by an unshakable community ethos.

1g1c2n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g1c2n5/sagebreville_barista_express_advice/,[Sage/Breville Barista Express] advice,"I have been gradually improving my espresso game with the barista express. Here what I've learnt so far. I'm now able to consistently pull tasty shots.

Dosing:

Before the first shot of the day purge the grinder with 4 g of fresh beans. 
If this is not done 3-4 g of your puck will be old coffee. The flow through this puck will be faster than the next shot and may lead to you adjusting the grind size unnecessarily.

Weigh in the beans required for a single dose. Don't store the beans in the hopper or use grind timer function. 

I find 15.5 g of a medium roast fills the basket well and brews constently. Too large doses can result it too little headspace between the puck and the shower screen resulting in a choked shot. I find this is especially an issue when the portafilter is slightly damp on back-to-back shots. The moisture causes the grinds to swell slightly. The thicker puck can result in choking due to insufficient headspace. You can sometime diagnose an overfilled basket by looking for a shower screen impression on the top of the puck following extraction. I was having trouble with back-to-back shots until I reduced the dose by half a gram.

Puck prep:

Use a WDT tool before tamping. Tamp the puck so the coffee bed is level and only tamp once. You cannot tamp too hard, but you can tamp too softly. When you tamp you remove the air pockets between the ground coffee particles. Once these pockets are removed, through pressure, you can't squash the puck any further, so overtamping is not possible.

Extraction:

Weigh the espresso output and time the shots

Hold the two shot button to pre-infuse the coffee until the first few drops of coffee come through the portafilter. Then release the button and start the stopwatch. Aim for a 1:2 ratio in 25-30s.

Mix the espresso with a spoon before tasting as the shot taste profile can change throughout the extraction.

Between shots run a blank through the portafilter and wipe the shower screen clean. 
Dry the portafilter as much a possible before grinding for the next shot. 



I hope something here is helpful to new or old barista express owners alike. You can brew some good espresso with this thing after a bit of practice.

1g1c2n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g1c2n3/dating_then_what_happened/,Dating then what happened?,"I‚Äôm (30F), dating a guy (31M). We‚Äôve known each other since college because of mutual friends. 8yrs after, we reconnected on social media.

He has been inviting me out since Dec2022. Since I was single, I thought about accepting his invite for coffee. So we went out in Jan2023. The catching up went well and I must say, we were pretty much comfortable with each other even after long not seeing each other. After that coffee invite, he invited me for dinner. I agreed, and after that night I felt like he was trying to date me. He consistently made invites from Jan2023-Sept2023, but I failed to make time. Although, he kept on messaging then and kept his presence. Since i couldn‚Äôt set a day with him,  he made ways to see me ‚Äî like sending me meds when im sick and delivering some sweets.

In sept2023, we met again when he insisted to hand me a box of sweets himself. Pretty thoughtful, ya. I became more comfortable with him. Since then we started seeing each other, dating, through sharing meals and watching movies, Sept2023-Dec2023. He has confessed his feelings to me and became more expressive. We even celebrated his Dec bday dinner. 

Come Jan2024, he has expressed his intent of wanting to exclusively date me. I said that I wasn‚Äôt ready yet and I didn‚Äôt want to give him that confidence yet as I might not know him more thoroughly. So through the months of Jan2024-Sept2024, (1) his parents and family knows about me, (2) we would go out at least once in 2wks, (3) we‚Äôd text every day. However, we weren‚Äôt labeled as exclusive yet though I‚Äôm not seeing anyone else because I can‚Äôt seem to pacify my reservations of him due to some inconsistencies and change in energy. Around July2024-early Sept2024 he became busy with his exam‚Äî it was a very important matter ‚Äî so I understand the shift in priorities etc.

After his exam, I got to meet his parents for the first time. They were lovely and warm. Since he just finished his exam, he made it up to me and we went on a 3-day trip! His parents even booked us dinner in a lovely resto during our trip. We had fun, he was looking forward to it! We had a good time exploring cafes and going around. We slept in one room and on 2 different beds. I‚Äôm happy he respected that. We became closer during the trip, like we‚Äôd sit closer to each other and I‚Äôd allow him to be that physically close to me since we used to sit facing each other when dining. Before ending the trip, I confessed my feelings to him. ‚ÄúYou probably know now that I like you, huh :)?‚Äù Which he responded with a smile :) and reaffirmed with ‚ÄúI like you too‚Äù. Then we comfortably held hands for the first time and gave hugs. During the entire trip back to the city, he held my hand. Bet I‚Äôm sure, we didn‚Äôt label ourselves in a relationship (which is fine with me, because it‚Äôs only now that I‚Äôd be expressing myself more to him and getting to know us better). 

After our trip about 2wks ago, we‚Äôre back in our respective places. I observed that he became less responsive and communicative (text). Since he just finished his exam, he made time for his family too and they went on a trip! We planned a date once he returns from his trip (which is next wk). 

I‚Äôm just unease because he never skipped a day not messaging me since Jan2024-Sept2024. 90% of the time he would message me first. And now that he‚Äôs in this trip Oct2024, it‚Äôs been 2 days that has hasn‚Äôt messaged me substantially (like only 1 message saying they were going to a flower farm). He didn‚Äôt even message me before flying off or upon landing or after their day‚Äôs trip. I thought to myself that maybe he‚Äôs enjoying time with his family, no problem with that. BUTTTT, for him to ‚Äúlike‚Äù a post I had on fb and see my stories and still not msg me was sooo strange??! üòü nor did he apologize for not messaging me the past few days. 

I‚Äôve already brought this up with him months before (same issue of not messaging me substantially). He already know this scar and wound, he told me then he understands it and he was sincerely sorry. It kinda change for some time yet still reverted to like this. 

I‚Äôve been meaning to talk to him when we see each other.. but since I like him already, my judgement may have been clouded.. Are all the flags there already? Should I prepare myself on a possible end to all this?

1g1bw0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeoptimize/comments/1g1bw0e/maximum_effect_for_minimum_cost_in_marketing/,Maximum Effect for Minimum Cost in Marketing,"# Why I started to think differently about marketing

If you have ever worked at a trade show, you will know they are hot, sweaty, and hard on the feet. One incredibly miserable way to spend a huge heap of cash.

But too often, we follow the pack. And so it is with marketing. We do what others are doing.

When I started out renting stands, we had to take the cheapest to be there at all. This meant getting the smallest, most hidden away stand in the darkest corner of the exhibition centre, where no one had a hope of finding you. We stood there, smiling crazily at any passerby, who almost invariably only stopped to ask the way.

Recovering from the horrors back in the office, I read of three Cambridge graduates who had taken a different approach to launch their smoothie business. They took a minimal-cost stall at a jazz festival in London and brought two bins with them, one marked yes, and one no. A large sign asked the public if they should give up their day jobs to make these drinks.

By the end of the day, the ‚Äúyes bin‚Äù was full. But in addition to market validation, they had created more buzz than we could ever hope for in our gloomy corner at a trade show. For a minute percentage of the cost. People were intrigued, amused and their imaginations caught. So they talked about it.

The company was¬†[Innocent Drinks](https://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/)¬†and their appearance at the jazz festival still stands as a perfect example of guerilla marketing.

# Traditional vs Guerilla

I was bemoaning the cost of exhibition stands and waxing slightly envious about Innocent‚Äôs launch to a friend a little while after this. They introduced me to a book called¬†[Guerrilla Marketing](https://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Marketing-4th-Inexpensive-SmallBusiness-ebook/dp/B003WUYP2Y)¬†by the late Jay Conrad Levinson. It changed my way of thinking.

Start-ups and small businesses can not afford to compete with the big guys when it comes to marketing. More importantly,

***Startups and small businesses shouldn‚Äôt try to compete with the big guys in marketing.***

They should play to their strengths. Be proud of where they are.

Innocent‚Äôs setup wouldn‚Äôt have worked for Coca-Cola. But it worked perfectly for them.

Guerrilla marketing is

* Low cost
* Memorable ‚Äî something that people will talk about and share
* All about the emotional connection with the audience
* Uses surprise, humour, originality and authenticity
* Strong on branding
* Focussed on precise locations and audiences
* May appear in unexpected places and very unexpected ways

Guerrilla Marketing is as effective today as it always was. While researching my books, I talked to the founder of a newly launched dating app. When you think of a tech company, guerilla marketing might not be an obvious way to go.

However, these founders completely understood that people want stories and the more unusual the better.

One of the founders made up a cardboard sandwich board. On it, he wrote that he had been dumped by his girlfriend for cheating and wearing it was his punishment. He paraded himself in front of a London bus. They took pictures, but more importantly, so did passers-by.

It achieved 5000 downloads on Instagram for minimal cost and became the first in a series of sandwich board marketing which would become a trade mark for them. Today, the brand is the international dating app¬†[Thursday](https://www.getthursday.com/).

# Different guerrilla approaches

The dating app founders used a form of guerrilla marketing,¬†*buzz marketing,*¬†to make a splash.

This focuses on one or more people in the company and builds the stories around them, often turning them into celebrities in the process. If you are comfortable performing in the spotlight, this is a route worth considering.

After taking in the harsh comparison of Innocent‚Äôs launch versus our trade show bills, I did inch towards the spotlight a little more, teaching at universities and becoming involved in campaigns to promote entrepreneurship. But it was still traditional stuff. I was never the sort of personality suited to a buzz marketing campaign.

And that doesn‚Äôt matter. There are other approaches you can take.¬†*Piggybacking*¬†onto events and trade shows is one of them.

The big opportunity of that annual trade show for us was to catch up with existing and potential customers face to face, people who normally we were geographically too far to see. And a large quantity of them.

I realized that there was nothing to stop us from visiting as an exhibitor and buying coffees for endless streams of clients, nor from meeting them for drinks or dinner in the evening.

You can go further by organizing an event of your own nearby not just an exhibition but any venue that has high attendance of your potential customers.

*A pop-up stand*¬†would be cheaper still. Some artistic street art, or simply handing out some eye-catching and highly original leaflets to the visitors would all be even more economical and if well done, far more memorable than a tiny stand inside.

Whatever you do, creating a guerilla marketing campaign is no space for shyness. The aim is to draw a crowd and make whatever you are doing so interesting, it inspires people to share the experience on social media.

The results can even end up going viral ‚Äî but only if your branding is authentic and on point, and whatever you create is memorable, entertaining and better yet involves some of your audience in the experience.

# Digital Guerrillas

If bouncing around in the spotlight in person isn‚Äôt for you, there is an alternative, because..

>

It is a quicker, faster and more effective way of sharing what you get up to in person than word of mouth used to be.

But you can also use it in unexpected, original ways that will also have an instant emotional connection with your audience and therefore inspire them to share on their platforms.

These are a few ideas to inspire you. Take that inspiration and create something unique,

* Try scavenger hunts on one or more areas where you have a presence on the net. Hide clues and messages and offer prizes. Share the stories and funny comments that your followers leave behind.
* Come up with a challenge so original, so unique that people everywhere will get involved and watch a campaign take flight. One of the most successful guerilla marketing campaigns ever was launched to raise money for Motor Neurone. That was ‚ÄúThe I[ce Bucket Challenge‚Äù](https://www.als.org/ibc)¬†and an unbelievable 17 million people got involved, filming each other emptying full ice buckets over their heads.
* Use the power of storytelling. Use the storyboard technique and split it over several platforms, for example, you might have part one on social media, two on the website, and three live in person. If the story is strong enough, people will go hunting, and talk about the hunt too.
* Throw newsjacking upside down. Latch onto a story that is trending, but find a totally crazy, unexpected angle. Mix up the familiar with the completely bizarre.
* Create the unexpected: a page header on your site that leads to digital graffiti; chatbots that tell funny jokes or have unexpected features.

Jar people out of normality. Startle them away from the mundane.

But always keeping it ethical is crucial and that can be a fine line. Test everything on your typical audience first to be sure they get the funny sides.

The same applies with tangible and online guerrilla marketing; everything has to stay on brand and be relevant and authentic. Try, test, record the hype, repeat.

# Unleash your creativity

Of course, even the big boys are not averse to great marketing at low cost. Low cost just becomes relative.

But the best campaigns still offer inspiration. Have a look at:

* Australia‚Äôs Metro trains used an animated video ‚Äú[Dumb Ways to Die‚Äù](https://campaignbrief.com/australian-campaigns-of-the-decade-metro-trains-dumb-ways-to-die-2012%E2%80%88via-mccann-melbourne/)¬†to promote railway safety. It was successful not least because the animation and humour are the complete opposite of what we are used to for a safety video and that juxtaposition grabs the viewer immediately.
* Colegate toothpaste replaced traditional wooden lollies and ice cream sticks with ones that looked like¬†[toothbrushes](https://www.commarts.com/project/14903/colgate)¬†with their logo and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget‚Äù written on them. A slick reminder to brush your teeth, and to use Colegate when you do it. Massively shareable, perfect for a viral campaign, and of course everyone wanted to find one.
* Furniture company Ikea promoted a new store in Paris by decorating a subway[¬†station](https://www.fastcompany.com/90346968/ikea-turned-a-paris-subway-station-into-a-showroom-and-its-glorious)¬†nearby with their products. For a company such as Ikea, the cost of a store promotion in a subway station was minor, but the impact was huge.

All three campaigns were on-brand and done in completely unexpected ways at relatively low cost. All three got people talking, online and off it.

You don‚Äôt have to start that big or spend very much at all. What you do need is to know your audience, know where a lot of them go and what would wow them.

It isn‚Äôt the most expensive that is effective, but the most creative. Let your imagination go wild.

A LOT of shops are putting full confidence in their RO, reassuring guests they can safely accommodate. I don‚Äôt think this is enough‚Ä¶.

We have RO filtration but it is not connected to our ice machine. So I‚Äôm thinking we need:
- bagged ice or no iced drinks. Turning the ice machine off so it does not continue to run with contaminated water.
- a carafe of RO water for employees to wash hands safely for food preparation
- to adjust the settings of our drip and espresso boilers to heat to 212¬∞. They currently do not, and most coffee shops do not heat their water to boiling enough for notices like this.
- we do manual pour overs, so I would want staff to boil RO water to 212¬∞ for a minute, let cool, and then brew with that water.

Tuesday night, she ate a small bundle of scrap yarn that I didn‚Äôt know was out and about and because I was hanging out with my roommate, I didn‚Äôt find out about it until up to 3 hours later. By that time the damage was done and she needed surgery, but I was being quoted $4-7k at one place, and 7-9k for her surgery, and both places said we were looking at the high end considering the fact that, not to be graphic, but her internal organs were starting to twist upon themselves. 

12 hours after I brought her into the vet to hopefully have surgery, I had to take into account that her quality of life might not be improved by removing the yarn, and due to her age (10) she probably wouldn‚Äôt even make it off the table, so I signed the paperwork to have her put to sleep. She passed away in my arms not even a year and a half after I rescued her. 

Now I‚Äôm dealing with cleaning up. I‚Äôve brushed as much fur of hers as I could off of various surfaces, I‚Äôve folded up her favorite blanket and put it away under my coffee table, and I‚Äôll soon be tossing her cat tower (it‚Äôs really old and starting to get ratty and unsalvageable). The hardest part about this is that she lived in my room. She never got along with my roommates cat so all of her stuff is in there. She had access to the rest of the house to explore, but she preferred my room. I have to keep my bedroom door open most times now because when I walk in there I still expect to hear her little hums of greetings. 

How do I stop blaming myself for her death? I keep thinking that I could‚Äôve done something different, cleaned my room more thoroughly, gone into my room more often to spend time with her, I feel terrible. I know that there wasn‚Äôt much I could‚Äôve done since she‚Äôs never been one to eat things that she shouldn‚Äôt, and I didn‚Äôt even know that the yarn was accessible to her. I‚Äôm so angry at myself for letting this happen. I should‚Äôve had so much more time with her, and she was the sweetest girl ever and never deserved to have anything like this happen. She never ate things she wasn‚Äôt supposed to, she never yowled in the middle of the night, she always ALWAYS loved her head and chin skritches, and she loved cuddling with me under my covers at night.

1g1bsi4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g1bsi4,Battle of the 100 proofs ,"It‚Äôs fRYEday and I‚Äôm choosing violence! Here I have two 100-proof rye whiskeys. 

One comes from old Forester and it is there 100 proof ride which comes in at 65% rye 20% malted barley and 15% corn. There is no age statement on this bottle. This bottle runs for $28 and is found in most liquor stores. 


And the other one comes from Old Pogue Distillery, and it is the old Maysville club, bottled and bond, rye whiskey. The old Maysville club was aged for four years and is 100% rye. This bottle runs $90 I have only found this bottle at the distillery but that does not mean you won‚Äôt be able to find it in your area. 

These two having a different price point but having the same amount of proof I wanted to figure out if the price point was worth it so I sat down and compared these two bottles for the past few nights to see which one I thought was best. 

The guidelines for this tasting: 
I tried to keep this tasting as unbiased as I could. I did a blind tasting for the first two nights I had my wife for the glass and I wrote down my thoughts on the poor for the next two nights. I poured the glass myself and drank it either while watching a movie or smoking a cigar.

The old Forester offered very little heat but had a lot of chocolate, coffee, nut, and baking spice flavors. on the finish, there was a little bit of burn, but for the most part, this bottle offered a very pleasant drinking experience and was decently smooth. In my opinion, I think this bottle is well worth the $28 I bought it for. I think it drinks about at 100 proof. I think the flavors are amazing and the burn is to be expected when you‚Äôre drinking something 100-proof we all expect a little bit of a kick.

The old Mayesville club had a lot more of a tropical fruit flavor with citrus, cinnamon, a hint of chocolate, and not as much baking spice as I anticipated going down there is absolutely no burn. However, once you get to the finish a nice Kentucky hug does greet you. I wouldn‚Äôt quite call it burn but there‚Äôs heat for sure on the finish. You definitely taste a lot more of the baking spice and a hint of oak. Personally, I like this bottle I would probably buy one again. I think the price point comes in a little high but nonetheless, I think it‚Äôs good.


With everything being said, I definitely think both are great bottles. I think both are very unique in their own way, but I personally have to give this competition to Old Forrester.  

Why: I gave this competition to Old Forster due to pricing, availability, and flavor. 

I definitely think the Maysville Club drinks better than the old Forester however I do not think it drinks $50 better. I have also gone to three liquor stores in my area and I have found the Old Forester on every shelf, but I have only found the Maysville Club on one shelf finally I think the Old Forester are offered the types of flavor you would typically expect from a ride With the chocolate, the baking spice, and the cinnamon compared to the Maysville clubs, almost rum like flavors. 

Once again, I think both are great bottles, but I think that the old Forrester just had a slightly better ROI than the Maysville Club. I still highly recommend that you go check out both and form your own opinion but if you only had my review to go off of, I‚Äôm gonna tell you to go with the old Forster 10 times out of 10",1,1728658748.0,whiskey,0,1.0,False

","In today's digital landscape, CAPTCHAs are essential tools for protecting websites from bots and spam. However, many users and companies are looking for ways on **how to solve CAPTCHA** or even **how to bypass CAPTCHA** to automate processes like data collection or mass site operations.

Beyond CAPTCHAs, there's a concept known as CAPTCHA solving services in the modern digital world (whatever that means). This is precisely the tool designed to help bypass these limitations, providing quick and efficient access to resources.

Beyond CAPTCHAs, there's a concept known as CAPTCHA solving services in the modern digital world (whatever that means). These are precisely the tools designed to help **solve CAPTCHA online**, providing quick and efficient access to resources.

The truth is, not every service can deliver the three main components of any successful project: speed, quality, and low cost! A fast CAPTCHA bypass can either be high-quality and expensive or low-quality and cheap. But what's the point of such automation then? You can write code poorly and cheaply and solve it yourself.

*In general, the rule ""Fast, Good, Cheap‚Äîpick two"" works perfectly!*

By the way, it's always amusing when people get angry about articles like this. Like, why write such texts and talk about paid services at all? In such moments, one can give the example of coffee shops that sell coffee. You can always brew coffee yourself at home and not buy it at a coffee shop. But then you need beans, and here we face buying beans from a company that purchases, roasts, and sells coffee‚Äîso why pay such companies? You can roast the beans yourself (and some geeks might even grow coffee beans themselves) rather than buy them from a company! Everything is possible‚Äîbut some prefer coffee from a caf√©; for some, it's a lifestyle; some (like me, for example) are used to brewing at home themselves, and some even roast these beans on their own. Everyone is different!

* **Grow the beans yourself** (understand the intricacies of a particular CAPTCHA), **roast them** (set up your own solution), and **brew coffee from what you have** (use your version).
   * This is akin to learning **how to solve a CAPTCHA code** on your own.
* If you have a coffee machine‚Äî**pour the beans in and press a button to get a cup of invigorating drink** (in the case of CAPTCHA recognition‚Äîit's a ready-made module for some programming language, but you'll still have to pay for recognition).
   * *Similar to using tools that help you* ***solve CAPTCHA online*** *with minimal effort.*¬†
* **Buy coffee at a caf√©** (directly use a CAPTCHA recognition service).¬†
   * Here, you rely on professional **captcha solving services** to do the work for you.

In this article, we'll look at the **top 10 best CAPTCHA solving services** in 2024, many of which strive to combine the following components into a whole:

**High-quality CAPTCHA bypass**

**Fast CAPTCHA bypass**

**Cheap CAPTCHA bypass** (as a rule, many neglect the third point since CAPTCHAs have become more complex lately).

These timeless pieces not only bring a sense of history and character to a home, but they also allow for a distinctive, curated style that is hard to replicate with mass-produced items. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned collector or just starting to explore the charm of vintage design, here‚Äôs why vintage furniture and home d√©cor are perfect for adding both personality and value to your living space. Checkout:¬†[**room & board**](https://www.kashew.com/brand/room-and-board)

**1. The Charm of Vintage Furniture**

Vintage furniture refers to pieces that are at least 20 years old, representing a broad range of styles from different eras, such as mid-century modern, Art Deco, and Victorian. Unlike contemporary furniture, vintage pieces often have a unique design, made from high-quality materials and crafted with exceptional attention to detail. This craftsmanship is a significant reason why vintage furniture is prized ‚Äî not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its durability.

Each piece tells a story, and when incorporated into your home, it adds a layer of history and character that modern furniture simply cannot. Whether it‚Äôs a well-worn leather armchair from the 1960s or a beautifully carved wooden coffee table from the 1920s, vintage furniture offers a timeless appeal that can complement a variety of interior styles.

**2. Sustainability and Quality**

One of the most compelling reasons to invest in vintage furniture and home d√©cor is sustainability. In today‚Äôs world, where environmental consciousness is growing, buying vintage is a way to reduce waste and lessen the demand for new resources. Vintage pieces are often made from materials that have stood the test of time, such as solid wood or sturdy metals, which means they can last for decades, if not centuries.

Furthermore, opting for vintage helps to avoid the fast-furniture trend that often results in cheaply made products with short lifespans. When you choose vintage, you‚Äôre choosing quality and sustainability ‚Äî a win for both your home and the environment.

**3. A Unique and Personalized Space**

In a time when home d√©cor trends can feel uniform and repetitive, vintage furniture offers a way to create a truly one-of-a-kind living space. Each vintage item is imbued with character, whether it‚Äôs the patina on an old brass lamp or the wear on a distressed leather sofa. These pieces allow you to design a space that reflects your personality and tastes, rather than following mass-market trends. Click here for:¬†[**used room & board**](https://www.kashew.com/brand/room-and-board)

Vintage items also lend themselves to mixing and matching, allowing for eclectic design schemes that can combine pieces from different eras and styles. For example, a 1950s teak dining table can sit beautifully alongside Art Deco chairs from the 1920s, while a Victorian-era mirror can make a striking statement in a minimalist, contemporary space. The key is in the balance, letting vintage pieces shine as focal points while harmonizing with your overall design.

**4. Decorative Accents with Vintage Charm**

In addition to furniture, vintage home d√©cor accessories can provide the perfect finishing touches to a room. Items like vintage rugs, wall art, mirrors, and lamps offer an effortless way to incorporate historical charm into your space without committing to larger furniture investments.

* **Vintage lighting**: Whether it‚Äôs an ornate chandelier or a quirky 1960s table lamp, lighting is one of the easiest ways to add a vintage touch to any room.
* **Vintage textiles**: Vintage rugs, curtains, and throw pillows made from natural fibers like wool, silk, or linen can bring warmth, texture, and history to your d√©cor.
* **Wall art and mirrors**: Vintage art pieces, whether they are paintings, prints, or photographs, can add character to a space. Similarly, an antique mirror can serve as a striking focal point while making a room feel larger.

**5. How to Source Vintage Pieces**

Finding vintage furniture and d√©cor can be a fun and rewarding process. You can discover unique items at local flea markets, antique shops, and estate sales. Online platforms like eBay, Etsy, and dedicated vintage retailers also offer a wide selection of pieces from different eras. When shopping for vintage items, be sure to check the condition and authenticity of the piece. Look for quality craftsmanship, such as dovetail joints in wood furniture or hand-blown glass in lighting. Visit here:¬†[**used furniture portland**](https://www.kashew.com/location/pdx)

**Conclusion**

Vintage furniture and home d√©cor are more than just design elements; they are an expression of individuality, craftsmanship, and sustainability. By incorporating vintage pieces into your home, you create a space that is rich in history, brimming with character, and uniquely yours. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to the elegance of Art Deco, the simplicity of mid-century modern, or the charm of rustic farmhouse styles, vintage items offer endless possibilities for creating a home that stands the test of time.

Rather than deal with it, I just sold it and ordered the new Pro E24,, which has a brass boiler. The customer service at WLL were very excited but the temperatures being more stable, hence less fluctuations and hope less surfing needed... Am waiting for the machine to show up tomorrow.



Meanwhile, I just saw the new video of Gaggia Cadorna and I am tempted...

We drink at least 1 espresso a day and my wife love a cappuccino every 2 days or so... I love to make it for her with Gaggia Classic.. It is a little bit involved but doable

My wife sees the trouble I go through and she just goes and uses the Nespresso lattisma which we have had for over 10 years, which makes average coffee at best (well compared to Starbucks it is light years ahead, but that changed once I got the Gaggia :))

  
What are you thoughts about returning E24 and just getting the Codorna? Will it create as good espressos as Gaggia Classic. I know it is twice the price but I don't care about that.. Will be able to sell Nespresso and save on counter space...

  
Love you hear any experience of Codorna, perhaps someone who had used a Classic before or still uses one or both...

Hefe's solo is a little different than what we've heard him play on NOFX songs. 

Got a little more of a metal edge to it, especially considering the doubled guitars.

Nice to see Hefe branching out...

Enjoy! ü§ò

Or don't. I don't really care. ü§£

For those who rented an Airbnb or stayed at a hotel that wasn't AI, did you add up the costs and was it a big savings?

I now dread having to rent a car, set the gps (most early vacations with the kids were to Florida and Disney or similar and there was no gps back then),  hope the condo met the description, off to buy food and drinks and decising where to eat and when.  And more then one back and forth for sure for groceries.  

I keep thinking that yep probably can save some, but choosing a restaurant, constantly figuring out how much you just spent on a coffee or snack and if not a hotel cleaning up after yourself and deciding what you eat in the condo vs. prepared for you is just a hassle.

  
Yes love 3 meals a day, snacks, blender drinks, lattes, cappuccinos, iced coffees, smoothies......

**EXT. ATLAS BORDER ‚Äì NIGHT**

Snow falls steadily, covering the battlefield in cold, indifferent silence. **ADAM TAURUS** stands alone, battered and bleeding. His breath is ragged, muscles trembling, barely holding together. He faces an entire Atlesian battalion‚Äîsoldiers, drones, and mechs. Each breath is a fight against the burning pain in his chest, but he refuses to fall.

In the distance, **JAUNE ARC** lies slumped against a boulder, barely conscious. His breathing is shallow, his wounds severe, but his eyes remain open‚Äîwatching Adam, filled with desperation and helplessness.

**ADAM**  
*(softly, to himself)*  
""The price of freedom... is always steep.""

With a final breath, Adam grips his sword, **Wilt**, tightly and charges headfirst into the Atlesian forces. His red blade gleams in the moonlight as it slices through the first wave of soldiers. Sparks fly as he cuts through armor, tearing machine and flesh alike. He fights with a ferocity that belies the weariness in his limbs, as if each swing could be his last.

But even as he fights, his mind begins to drift‚Äîflashes of a life that could have been, a peace he‚Äôll never know.

**FLASH** ‚Äì Adam and **Blake Belladonna** sit at a caf√©, sunlight warming their faces. No weapons, no scars. They sip coffee and laugh, their burdens forgotten, their differences healed.

**FLASH** ‚Äì Adam walks with Blake through Vale, side by side. No hateful glares, no fear of confrontation. They‚Äôre just... people. Faunus and humans, living as equals.

**FLASH** ‚Äì Adam, Blake, and Jaune in a small apartment, playing video games. Jaune complains about losing, Adam teases him. For once, he feels happy, safe‚Äîlike they could have been more than just warriors.

Adam cuts down another soldier, but with each swing, his movements slow. The snow beneath him is stained with blood‚Äîhis blood‚Äîbut he fights on, determined. A drone fires at him, pain shooting through his side.

The flashes come again, harder to push away.

**FLASH** ‚Äì Adam, Blake, and Jaune at that same caf√©. Jaune‚Äôs smile is bright, confident. They‚Äôre joking‚Äîfriends, even.

**ADAM** *(thoughts)*  
""I wish... I could‚Äôve seen it. That world. A world where we weren‚Äôt fighting anymore.""

Reality crashes down‚Äîbrutal and unforgiving. His sword cleaves through another enemy, but his legs feel heavy, his vision blurs. The ache in his chest spreads, and he knows his body is failing. Still, he fights.

**ADAM** *(thoughts)*  
""I can‚Äôt stop. Not yet.""

His thoughts turn to Jaune. Is he strong enough? Adam has been his shield, his guide. Without him, would Jaune make it? The fear gnaws at him. He won‚Äôt be there to protect him anymore.

**ADAM** *(thoughts)*  
""After today... I‚Äôm leaving him alone. Will he make it?""

Adam drives his sword into the last soldier. The battlefield falls silent. The once-imposing army lies broken at his feet.

Adam stands amidst the carnage, swaying. He‚Äôs won, but the victory feels hollow. He knows the end is near. His legs give out, and he collapses in the snow, breath ragged. Blood flows freely from his wounds, staining the snow red.

Jaune, weak and trembling, drags himself through the snow toward Adam. Horror fills his eyes at the sight of his fallen mentor.

**JAUNE** *(voice shaking)*  
""Adam... you did it. You won. We can‚Äî""

Adam looks up, a faint, bitter smile on his lips. His eyes, once filled with anger, are soft now‚Äîtired.

**ADAM**  
""No... you can go. This... this is where I stop.""

He presses **Wilt** into Jaune‚Äôs trembling hands. Jaune grips it tightly, almost too much to bear.

**JAUNE** *(pleading)*  
""No, Adam... we can make it out together. Please.""

Adam chuckles weakly, resting his hand on Jaune‚Äôs shoulder in a final, comforting squeeze.

**ADAM**  
""You‚Äôre stronger than you think, Jaune.""

Adam‚Äôs gaze drifts skyward as snow falls. His voice softens, filled with a wistful longing.

**ADAM**  
""I would‚Äôve loved to see it... that world where we didn‚Äôt have to hate each other. Where Faunus and humans lived in peace.""

Adam‚Äôs thoughts turn to Blake. Her face flashes before him‚Äîher eyes, the way she looked at him before she left.

**ADAM** *(softly)*  
""Find Blake... tell her... I was wrong.""

His voice falters. The bitterness is softened by regret.

**ADAM**  
""Tell her... I forgive her.""

He struggles with the weight of it all, his hand slipping from Jaune‚Äôs shoulder, strength gone.

**ADAM** *(thoughts)*  
""I‚Äôll never know if she forgives me.""

His gaze returns to Jaune, the boy now carrying the weight of everything Adam fought for. The fear lingers‚Äîthat Jaune might crumble under it.

**ADAM** *(thoughts)*  
""Jaune... I‚Äôm leaving you alone. But you have to make it. You have to see that world for me.""

Adam‚Äôs vision darkens. The cold seeps into his bones, but strangely, it‚Äôs peaceful. A content smile plays on his lips as he takes his final breath. He is finally... at peace.

Jaune, tears streaming, clutches Adam‚Äôs body. He grips Wilt and **Blush**, the weight unbearable. He knows he has to keep moving, but the pain of leaving Adam behind is almost too much.

With shaking hands, Jaune rises. He takes one last look at Adam‚Äôs still form, heart breaking, then turns toward the border. He walks forward, alone, carrying Adam‚Äôs will and the burden of a future he must build.

The world is vast and cold, but beyond the snow, beyond Atlas, lies the world Adam dreamed of. A world of peace, a world of harmony‚Äîa world Jaune must now find on his own.",1,1728657482.0,RwbyFanfiction,0,1.0,False

I'm in nursing school and have 10 hour clinicals right now (starting at 6:30 am) and soon 12 hours, where I'm working as a bedside nurse in the hospital. I love the work, but no matter how good of a day it is, or how much I love it, I am so sick by the end of the day. I knew this about me before starting nursing school and it's still a huge fear for when I rejoin the workforce (stay at home mom right now). If I'm not somewhere where I can regulate everything around me, I inevitably basically break. All the symptoms come, migraine, extreme full body fatigue and pain in every inch of me, I get extremely tired, GI issues (usually constipation and bloat), and the list goes on. 

I think a lot of you guys can relate, which is why I'm asking for advice on here! I basically want to know if and how any of you in similar situation stay ahead of your pain. It's taking me months to figure out some of this for myself. 

So far, I go to sleep early the night before, hopefully around 8:30 if things go smoothly with my kids, I have coffee in the morning (I can't eat breakfast that early) I drink plenty of water in the mornings as well. I pack food that I can snack on through the day, and I try to stay healthy with it, protein and fruits mostly. I will eat a hot breakfast in the cafeteria, and either a ""girl lunch"" or a microwave meal like pad thai or something. I have ibuprofen with me that I take at the first signs of pain. I drink 2 plus liters of water. I also sit and rest as often as I can.  

I really don't know what else to do. Any tips or advice would be so welcomed!! I want this to work for me so bad. I can't just go through nursing school and then not be able to physically be a nurse because my body gets in the way. I try to be kind to myself, but I also want to function close to a normal human being and hold a job!

Amazon, a titan in online retail, has recently revamped its listing rules, setting the stage for a new era of product presentation. But don‚Äôt fret‚Äîthese updates are your golden opportunity to refine your listings and boost your sales.¬†

Amazon‚Äôs latest rules are not just hurdles; they‚Äôre steppingstones to elevate your brand‚Äôs presence and increase your visibility.

Get ready to transform your listings into powerful tools that drive engagement and conversion. Let‚Äôs dive into the world of Amazon‚Äôs updated rules and discover how to leverage them for your success!

# Key Changes in Amazon‚Äôs Product Listing Guidelines

As Amazon continues to dominate the e-commerce landscape, staying updated with its evolving listing guidelines is crucial for¬†[**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-improve-amazon-fba-ads-creatives/)¬†sellers aiming to thrive in this competitive environment.¬†

Recent changes in Amazon‚Äôs product listing policies have introduced new requirements and best practices designed to enhance the shopping experience and ensure compliance with legal standards.¬†

# Enhanced Product Title Requirements

One of the most significant updates involves the structure and content of product titles. Amazon now mandates that titles be clear, concise, and include relevant keywords while avoiding excessive capitalization and promotional language.

* For instance, instead of a title like ‚ÄúAmazing High-Quality Leather Wallet ‚Äì Best Buy ‚Äì Limited Time Offer!‚Äù, you should use a straightforward and informative title such as ‚ÄúGenuine Leather Wallet for Men ‚Äì RFID Blocking ‚Äì Slim Design.‚Äù This new format helps customers quickly understand what the product is and its key features without being overwhelmed by marketing jargon.

Product titles are a crucial element in Amazon‚Äôs new listing format, and they play a significant role in keyword optimization. The updated guidelines require titles to be informative and clear, incorporating relevant keywords without appearing spammy.¬†

* For example, if you‚Äôre selling a fitness tracker, instead of a generic title like ‚ÄúFitness Tracker,‚Äù a more effective title might be ‚ÄúWaterproof Fitness Tracker with Heart Rate Monitor ‚Äì Activity and Sleep Tracking ‚Äì Compatible with iOS and Android.‚Äù This title not only includes keywords like ‚ÄúFitness Tracker,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeart Rate Monitor,‚Äù and ‚ÄúActivity Tracking,‚Äù but it also provides potential buyers with specific details about the product‚Äôs features.

# Improved Bullet Point Formatting

Amazon has refined the rules for bullet points to enhance readability and user experience. The updated guidelines emphasize the need for bullet points to be succinct, focused on key product benefits, and free from promotional language.

Previously, a product listing might have included bullet points like:

¬†

* ‚ÄúThis wallet is fantastic and the best choice ever!‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSuper amazing and high-quality materials used.‚Äù

Under the new rules, the bullet points should be more specific and informative, such as:

* ‚ÄúMade from genuine leather for durability and a premium feel.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFeatures RFID blocking technology to protect against identity theft.‚Äù

These changes aim to provide customers with essential information in a clear and organized manner.

Bullet points are another important area where keywords can be effectively used. Amazon‚Äôs new guidelines encourage¬†[**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-legal-steps-for-navigating-trademark-action-on-amazon-fba/)¬†sellers to use bullet points to highlight key features and benefits of the product, integrating relevant keywords in a natural and informative manner.

Consider a listing for a set of kitchen knives. Instead of bullet points like:

* ‚ÄúGreat for all your cutting needs!‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSharp and durable!‚Äù

You should use:

* ‚ÄúHigh-carbon stainless steel blades for superior sharpness and durability.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúErgonomic handles for comfortable grip and precision control.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIncludes chef‚Äôs knife, paring knife, and serrated bread knife.‚Äù

These bullet points incorporate keywords such as ‚Äúhigh-carbon stainless steel,‚Äù ‚Äúergonomic handles,‚Äù and ‚Äúchef‚Äôs knife,‚Äù while also providing valuable information to the buyer.

# Detailed Product Descriptions

[Product descriptions](https://medium.com/@charlesalora18/understanding-the-role-of-product-descriptions-on-amazon-74401781559e)¬†have become more critical with the latest updates, focusing on providing comprehensive and accurate information. Amazon now requires descriptions to be detailed and directly related to the product‚Äôs features and benefits, avoiding any misleading or exaggerated claims.

For example, rather than stating ‚ÄúThis product will make your life better,‚Äù a compliant description would provide detailed information like:

* ‚ÄúThis leather wallet features a slim design, making it easy to carry in your pocket. It includes RFID-blocking technology to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized scans. The wallet is designed with multiple compartments for cards and cash, ensuring convenient organization.‚Äù

The product description section is an opportunity to expand on your keywords and provide a detailed narrative about your product. Amazon‚Äôs updated guidelines stress the importance of avoiding keyword stuffing and instead focusing on providing a clear and engaging description.

For instance, for a smart home thermostat, rather than simply listing keywords like ‚Äúsmart thermostat,‚Äù ‚Äúhome automation,‚Äù and ‚Äúenergy-saving,‚Äù you might write:

* ‚ÄúUpgrade your home comfort with our smart thermostat, designed to seamlessly integrate with your home automation system. This energy-saving device offers precise temperature control and can be managed remotely via your smartphone. Compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, it ensures optimal comfort while reducing energy costs.‚Äù

This description not only includes essential keywords but also provides a compelling overview of the product‚Äôs features and benefits.

# Updated Image Requirements

The new guidelines place a stronger emphasis on image quality and consistency. Amazon requires that all product¬†listing images¬†be high-resolution, well-lit, and accurately represent the product. Additionally, listing images should be free from text overlays and promotional graphics.

For example, a product listing for a kitchen blender should feature:

* High-resolution listing images showing the blender from different angles.
* Close-up shots of key features like controls or attachments.
* Listing images of the blender in use, demonstrating its functionality.

Listing images that include text like ‚ÄúThe Best Blender Ever!‚Äù or promotional graphics are no longer allowed.

# Changes in Product Variations

Amazon has updated the rules for listing product variations to ensure they are clear and logical. Variations such as size, color, or style must be grouped under a single-parent listing, with each variation having its own distinct option.

Previously,¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers might have created separate listings for each color of a product. Now, Amazon encourages using a parent listing with variations, such as:

* Parent Listing: ‚ÄúMen‚Äôs Casual Shoes‚Äù
* Variation 1: ‚ÄúSize 10 ‚Äì Black‚Äù
* Variation 2: ‚ÄúSize 10 ‚Äì Brown‚Äù
* Variation 3: ‚ÄúSize 11 ‚Äì Black‚Äù
* Variation 4: ‚ÄúSize 11 ‚Äì Brown‚Äù

This approach helps consolidate options and improves the shopping experience by allowing customers to view all variations under one listing.

# Compliance with New Regulatory Standards

Amazon has also introduced guidelines to ensure that all product listings comply with relevant regulatory standards and safety regulations.¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers are now required to provide accurate information regarding certifications, safety features, and compliance with local laws.

For example, a listing for a toy should include:

* Information about compliance with safety standards like ASTM F963.
* Details on age appropriateness and any small parts warnings.

Providing accurate and transparent information helps build trust with customers and ensures that products meet necessary safety and regulatory requirements.

# The Impact of Amazon‚Äôs New Rules on Product Reviews

# Stricter Review Guidelines

Amazon‚Äôs new rules have introduced stricter guidelines for¬†[product reviews](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2018/05/31/4-ways-brands-can-get-more-amazon-product-reviews-without-breaking-the-rules/)¬†to combat fraudulent practices and ensure authenticity. Amazon FBA sellers must now be more vigilant about the sources of reviews and adhere to new standards for soliciting and managing feedback.

* For instance, Amazon has tightened regulations on incentivized reviews. Amazon FBA sellers are now prohibited from offering discounts or free products in exchange for positive reviews. This change aims to eliminate biased feedback and ensure that reviews reflect genuine customer experiences. As a result,¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers need to focus on delivering exceptional products and customer service to naturally earn positive reviews.

# Enhanced Review Moderation

The latest updates have also enhanced Amazon‚Äôs review moderation process. The platform now employs advanced algorithms and increased manual oversight to detect and remove fake or manipulated reviews.¬†

This means that reviews that are deemed suspicious or non-compliant with Amazon‚Äôs policies are more likely to be flagged or removed.

Amazon FBA¬†sellers need to be aware of these changes and ensure that their review practices comply with Amazon‚Äôs standards.

* For example, engaging in review manipulation or using review-generating services that promise to artificially boost ratings can lead to penalties and account suspension.¬†

Instead, focusing on genuine customer engagement and providing excellent products can help build a solid reputation and encourage authentic reviews.

# Changes to Review Metrics and Display

Amazon has made updates to how review metrics are displayed on product listings. The platform now emphasizes the importance of verified purchase reviews, which are reviews left by customers who have actually bought the product through Amazon.

Verified purchase reviews carry more weight and are prominently displayed, enhancing their credibility.¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers should encourage their customers to leave reviews through legitimate means, such as follow-up emails or customer service interactions.¬†

Highlighting the value of verified purchase reviews and focusing on maintaining high-quality products can positively impact your product‚Äôs reputation and visibility.

# New Policies on Review Solicitation

The updated rules also include new policies on how Amazon FBA sellers can solicit reviews from customers. Amazon now requires that review solicitation be conducted in a manner that does not pressure or coerce customers into leaving feedback.¬†

Amazon FBA¬†sellers are restricted from using pre-written review templates or automated messages that could influence the content of the review.

* For example, instead of sending a generic message that asks customers to ‚Äúleave a positive review,‚Äù Amazon FBA sellers should focus on providing exceptional service and requesting honest feedback in a non-intrusive manner. This approach aligns with Amazon‚Äôs guidelines and helps foster a more genuine review environment.

# Impact on Review Quality and Seller Reputation

The stricter review policies and enhanced moderation efforts are likely to result in higher-quality reviews and a more trustworthy review system. While this may lead to a reduction in the overall number of reviews, it will improve the reliability of feedback and provide more accurate insights into product performance.

Amazon FBA¬†sellers should view these changes as an opportunity to enhance their reputation by focusing on delivering high-quality products and exceptional customer service. Positive, genuine reviews will become even more valuable in this environment, reinforcing the importance of maintaining high standards.

# Avoiding Common Mistakes with New Amazon Listing Rules

# Misunderstanding Title Requirements

One of the most common mistakes¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers make is misinterpreting Amazon‚Äôs new title requirements. The updated guidelines emphasize clarity, relevance, and the exclusion of promotional language.

* A frequent error is including excessive keywords or promotional phrases in titles. For instance, a title like ‚ÄúAmazing Deal on the Best Quality Stainless Steel Water Bottle ‚Äì 50% Off Today!‚Äù not only appears spammy but also violates Amazon‚Äôs rules. Instead, focus on a clear and descriptive title such as ‚ÄúStainless Steel Insulated Water Bottle ‚Äì 24 Oz ‚Äì Leak-Proof and BPA-Free.‚Äù

# Neglecting to Update Bullet Points

Another common mistake is failing to update bullet points to align with Amazon‚Äôs new formatting guidelines. Bullet points should be concise, focused on key features, and free from marketing fluff.

* Amazon FBA¬†sellers often make the mistake of using vague or overly promotional bullet points like ‚ÄúThis product is simply the best!‚Äù or ‚ÄúTop-notch quality guaranteed!‚Äù Instead, use specific details such as ‚ÄúMade from high-grade stainless steel for long-lasting durability‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeatures a double-wall insulation to keep beverages hot or cold for hours.‚Äù

# Overloading Product Descriptions with Keywords

While keywords are essential for search visibility, overloading your product description with them is a common error. Amazon‚Äôs guidelines now stress the importance of providing detailed, relevant information without keyword stuffing.

* For example, rather than repeating ‚Äúorganic cotton‚Äù multiple times in a description, provide a comprehensive overview: ‚ÄúOur organic cotton t-shirts are made from 100% certified organic cotton, offering a soft, breathable feel. Designed with a relaxed fit and reinforced stitching, these shirts are perfect for everyday wear.‚Äù

# Using Poor-Quality Listing images

High-quality listing images are crucial for Amazon listings, and neglecting to adhere to updated image requirements is a significant mistake. Amazon now requires¬†listing images¬†to be high-resolution, clear, and free from promotional text or watermarks.

* A common issue is using low-resolution or poorly lit¬†listing images¬†that fail to showcase the product effectively. For instance, a blurry or poorly lit image of a kitchen appliance will not attract buyers. Instead, ensure that listing images are high-resolution, and well-lit, and show the product from multiple angles, including close-ups of important features.

# Incorrectly Handling Product Variations

Amazon‚Äôs new rules for product variations aim to improve clarity and organization. A common error is creating separate listings for each variation rather than using a parent listing with variations.

* For example, if you sell a product available in different colors and sizes, creating individual listings for each option can confuse customers and clutter search results. Instead, use a single parent listing with variations, such as:
* Parent Listing: ‚ÄúMen‚Äôs Athletic Shoes‚Äù
* Variation 1: ‚ÄúSize 10 ‚Äì Black‚Äù
* Variation 2: ‚ÄúSize 10 ‚Äì White‚Äù
* Variation 3: ‚ÄúSize 11 ‚Äì Black‚Äù
* Variation 4: ‚ÄúSize 11 ‚Äì White‚Äù

# Overlooking Regulatory Compliance

Recent updates have placed greater emphasis on compliance with regulatory standards. A common mistake is failing to provide accurate information about certifications, safety features, and legal requirements.

* For instance, listing a product as ‚Äúchild-safe‚Äù without appropriate certification or failing to mention safety warnings can lead to issues. Ensure that all claims are backed by evidence and that regulatory requirements are met. Include relevant details such as ‚ÄúMeets ASTM F963 safety standards for toys.‚Äù

# Ignoring Backend Keywords

Backend keywords are essential for expanding your listing‚Äôs reach, yet some¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers overlook this aspect. Amazon‚Äôs guidelines now stress the importance of using backend keywords to capture a wider range of search queries.

* A frequent mistake is using irrelevant or repetitive backend keywords. For instance, if you‚Äôre selling a yoga mat, including keywords like ‚Äúexercise mat‚Äù or ‚Äúfitness mat‚Äù can broaden your search visibility. Ensure that backend keywords are relevant and varied, avoiding redundancy and focusing on different search terms.

# Failing to Monitor Performance

Finally, failing to regularly monitor and adapt your listings based on performance data is a common mistake. Amazon‚Äôs algorithms and guidelines may change and staying informed about how your listings are performing is crucial for ongoing success.

* Regularly review your listing analytics to assess keyword performance, customer feedback, and sales metrics. Adjust your strategies based on this data to improve your listings and remain compliant with Amazon‚Äôs evolving rules.

# Amazon‚Äôs Changes in Listing Requirements for New Amazon FBA Sellers

# Streamlined Listing Processes

Amazon has introduced several changes aimed at streamlining the listing process for new Amazon FBA sellers. These updates are designed to make it easier to create and manage product listings while ensuring compliance with Amazon‚Äôs standards.

These templates help ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly and that listings comply with Amazon‚Äôs guidelines.

* For instance, the new templates provide clear instructions on how to input product details, upload¬†listing images, and set pricing, reducing the risk of errors and omissions.

# Enhanced Listing Tools

Amazon has updated its listing tools to offer a more user-friendly interface for new¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers.

# Updated Title and Description Guidelines

Amazon‚Äôs new listing requirements place a greater emphasis on clarity and relevance in product titles and descriptions. New¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers need to adhere to these updated guidelines to ensure their listings are effective and compliant.

# Title Structure

Amazon now requires that product titles be clear, concise, and focused on key attributes. Titles should avoid promotional language and keyword stuffing.¬†

* For example, instead of a title like ‚ÄúBuy Now! Best Quality 24-Piece Kitchen Knife Set ‚Äì Amazing Deal!‚Äù, use ‚Äú24-Piece Kitchen Knife Set ‚Äì High-Quality Stainless Steel with Ergonomic Handles.‚Äù

# Description Content

¬†Descriptions should provide detailed and accurate information about the product, including its features, benefits, and uses. New¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers must avoid overly promotional language and focus on delivering content that helps customers make informed purchasing decisions.¬†

* An effective description might include details such as ‚ÄúThis kitchen knife set features high-carbon stainless steel blades for precision cutting and ergonomic handles for comfort during extended use.‚Äù

# Image Requirements and Best Practices

High-quality listing images are essential for attracting customers and complying with Amazon‚Äôs updated listing requirements. New Amazon FBA sellers must adhere to specific guidelines to ensure their product¬†listing images¬†meet Amazon‚Äôs standards.

# Image Quality

Amazon now mandates that all¬†[product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-tips-for-amazon-fba-scroll-stopping-product-images/)¬†be high-resolution and free from text or watermarks.¬†Listing images¬†should clearly show the product and its key features. For example, if selling a fitness tracker, include clear, high-resolution listing images of the device from multiple angles and close-ups of the display and features.

# Image Format and Size

¬†New Amazon FBA sellers should ensure that their¬†listing images¬†meet Amazon‚Äôs format and size requirements. Listing images must be in JPEG, PNG, or GIF format and at least 1000 pixels in height or width to enable zoom functionality. Following these specifications helps improve the visual appeal and functionality of your listings.

# Improved Compliance and Verification Processes

Amazon has implemented more stringent compliance and verification processes to ensure that new Amazon FBA sellers adhere to its standards and policies. These changes are designed to prevent the listing of counterfeit or non-compliant products.

# Enhanced Verification

New¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers are now required to undergo a more thorough verification process to confirm their identity and business legitimacy. This includes providing additional documentation and undergoing identity checks.

* For example, you may need to submit proof of address, business registration documents, and bank statements.

# Compliance Checks

¬†Amazon has introduced more rigorous checks to ensure that product listings comply with relevant regulations and standards. New¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers must provide accurate information about product certifications, safety standards, and legal requirements.¬†

* For instance, if selling children‚Äôs toys, you must provide documentation proving that the products meet safety standards such as ASTM F963.

# Focus on Customer Experience

Amazon‚Äôs updates also emphasize enhancing the customer experience by improving the accuracy and quality of product listings. New¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers should prioritize factors that contribute to a positive shopping experience.

# Accurate Product Information

Ensure that all information provided in the listing is accurate and up to date. This includes product dimensions, materials, and features. Inaccurate or misleading information can lead to negative reviews and a poor customer experience.

# Clear and Relevant Keywords

Use relevant keywords naturally in your titles, bullet points, and descriptions to improve search visibility while avoiding keyword stuffing. Accurate and relevant keywords help customers find your products more easily and contribute to a better search experience.

# Adherence to New Policies and Procedures

Staying informed about Amazon‚Äôs latest policies and procedures is crucial for new Amazon FBA sellers. Amazon frequently updates its guidelines to address emerging trends, customer needs, and compliance requirements.

# Regularly Review Amazon‚Äôs Policies

New¬†[**Amazon FBA**¬†](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-some-training-videos-for-new-amazon-fba-sellers/)sellers should regularly review Amazon‚Äôs Seller Central resources and policy updates to stay informed about any changes that may impact their listings. This includes monitoring updates related to listing requirements, product compliance, and customer service.

# Adapt to Changes

Be prepared to adapt your listing strategies and practices based on Amazon‚Äôs updates. Implementing changes promptly and maintaining compliance helps ensure that your listings remain effective and competitive.

# Amazon‚Äôs New Listing Rules for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) Products

# Compliance with Amazon‚Äôs Labeling Standards

FBA products must adhere to Amazon‚Äôs updated labeling requirements to ensure proper handling and processing within Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers. This includes correct labeling of products, barcodes, and packaging.

* Example: If you are listing a ‚ÄúSmart Home Security Camera,‚Äù ensure that each unit has an accurate FNSKU label (Fulfillment Network Stock Keeping Unit) and that the label is correctly applied to the product packaging.

# Product Packaging and Preparation

Amazon has specified new guidelines for¬†[product packaging](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-attractive-product-packaging-improves-amazon-fba-reviews/)¬†and preparation to prevent damage and ensure that products are ready for efficient handling in Amazon‚Äôs warehouses.

* Example: For a ‚ÄúCeramic Coffee Mug,‚Äù ensure that each mug is individually wrapped in protective bubble wrap and packed in a sturdy, padded box. Products should be packaged to prevent breakage and meet Amazon‚Äôs packaging requirements.

# Inventory Management and Updates

Accurate inventory management is critical for FBA listings. Amazon‚Äôs new rules emphasize the importance of maintaining up-to-date inventory levels and promptly updating stock quantities.

* Example: If you are selling a ‚ÄúPortable Blender,‚Äù regularly monitor and update your inventory levels to reflect accurate stock availability. If inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, replenish stock promptly to avoid running out of stock.

# Enhanced Product Listing images

Amazon now requires high-quality listing images that clearly show the product from multiple angles and highlight key features. This helps customers make informed purchasing decisions and reduces the likelihood of returns due to misrepresentation.

* Example: For a ‚ÄúStainless Steel Water Bottle,‚Äù include listing images showing the bottle‚Äôs exterior, interior, and features such as the lid and insulation. Use high-resolution¬†listing images¬†with a plain background to provide a clear view of the product.

# Improved Listing Accuracy

Amazon FBA¬†sellers must ensure that their FBA listings accurately represent the product and its attributes. This includes providing correct information about size, color, material, and any special features or certifications.

* Example: When listing ‚ÄúOrganic Cotton T-Shirts,‚Äù specify details such as the material, available sizes, color options, and any certifications like ‚ÄúOEKO-TEX Standard 100.‚Äù Avoid vague descriptions and ensure all listed attributes match the actual product.

# Adherence to Safety and Compliance Standards

Amazon‚Äôs updated rules require that FBA products comply with all relevant safety and regulatory standards.¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers must provide necessary certifications and ensure that their products meet applicable laws and regulations.

* Example: For a ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Educational Toy,‚Äù include safety certifications such as ASTM F963 compliance and ensure that the product does not contain hazardous materials. Provide documentation of these certifications in the listing if required.

# Accurate Pricing and Discounts

Pricing accuracy is essential for FBA listings. Ensure that the listed price reflects the actual cost of the product and that any applicable discounts or promotions are clearly communicated.

* Example: If offering a ‚Äú10% Off‚Äù promotion on a ‚ÄúYoga Mat,‚Äù clearly state the original price and the discounted price in the listing. For instance, ‚ÄúYoga Mat ‚Äì Regular Price $29.99, Now $26.99 with 10% Discount.‚Äù

# Customer Reviews and Feedback

Amazon places importance on authentic customer reviews and feedback. Ensure that your product listings do not include misleading information and that any claims made about the product are substantiated.

* Example: If a ‚ÄúFitness Tracker‚Äù claims to have ‚ÄúAdvanced Heart Rate Monitoring,‚Äù ensure that this feature is accurately described and supported by the product‚Äôs specifications. Avoid making unverified claims or exaggerations.

# Handling Returns and Customer Service

Amazon FBA¬†sellers must adhere to Amazon‚Äôs policies regarding returns and customer service. This includes processing returns promptly and providing clear instructions for return requests.

* Example: For a ‚ÄúHome Cleaning Kit,‚Äù clearly outline the return policy in your listing, such as a ‚Äú30-day return policy with a full refund for unopened and undamaged products.‚Äù Ensure that customer service inquiries are handled promptly and professionally.

1g1b3gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1g1b3gp/western_christianity_weirds_me_out/,Western Christianity weirds me out,"Mainly charismatic/pentecostal or things leaning in that direction. Sometimes I wonder if its issues with my faith, but when I look at Christianity in the east, I don't see the same things. I am cradle orthodox, however I have lived in the west for the most of my life. So I have had personal interaction with this as well.

My personal issues are related to the ""energy"" of it, not energy in sense of theology but the vibe you get. It always feels like we are roleplaying something, and because its done in accordance to this ""sola scriptura"" and the ""traditions"" of whichever nondenom or charismatic church, it is therefore by default a ""Christian"" thing and correct.

The whole culture surrounding it makes me feel weird. Because instead of being different in behavior in terms of morals from within, and letting that naturally differentiate you or find people who are the same - you get artificially made behaviors that superimpose the morals instead. So it is as if I have to do behavior x to emulate moral y - instead of having/cultivating moral y, therefore I do behavior x as a result.

This then carries over to things like entire groups of youth being kind of isolated from rest of society, because they made their own ""thing"", but they still try to do the same things as normal people, but with those superimposed behaviors. This is also odd to me, since you then fight with natural human and social elements, that you are doing a social abnormality. It becomes very amish kind of. The faith becomes ""institutionalized"" or made into a ""thing"" instead of being a natural part of you. 

This social abnormality is also seen in going out in the streets and going up to random people, or asking to pray for strangers you stop in the street etc. Because these are not uncontacted remote people you are bringing news to, pretty much most people hear of God and Jesus in the west. So you add yourself to #39 of ""weird christian"" they have seen which turns them off because you behaved socially abnormal and demonstrated nothing of value to them, since they don't even know you.

I do however see actual opportunities being passed by, such as a single person in distress, or one homeless. This is less grandiose, so its easier to skim it - but this is a situation you should actually engage in, no? Helping someone like this to a greater extent even, is also ""abnormal"" in this world - but it is not humanly abnormal behavior. It is abnormal for the world, and society, it is maybe not ""cool"" - but it is actually innately human and natural, by design also. Disrupting 2 people having coffee in order to give them a pamphlet and ask to pray over them, is not a natural thing in my opinion. They will remember you as the guy who disrupted their gathering, you are not ""that"" special to blow them away. The defense is, ""its not me to impress them man"", and compare to Paul who was bad at public speaking. Yeah, ok.

In conferences or talks, so many Christian talkers or pastors try to make logical traps or arguments, to ""logically"" convince the atheist, which is just cringe. If you are talking truth, and you yourself believe it to be truth - speak it only, and let the truth present itself. It is always like, ""so you see, if this is so - how could this be so?"". Like come on man, just tell them the truth and leave it at that, don't add your own logical trap to it. As if the other person will go, oh crap his logic is overpowering me, I will now believe.

An atheist can often be even more logically inclined to deconstruct what they are saying, because the warning go off as if the person is trying to manipulate something into them. Or even encourages them to go into a logical argument now, instead of the message, now diverting from the actual topic.

All of these things weird me out. Public displays, being loud, everyone can see me pray, etc etc.

In the end I feel like the ""worse"" christian here, or a really calloused one who wants to suck the joy out of every situation. It makes finding a compatible partner very difficult as well, since most are into these kinds of circles. And everything is grandiose, big, loud, hyper, extreme.

**I'm turning 23 on Halloween**, and I'm hoping to make it special with mails.

To make your ads irresistible, you need more than just basic visuals and text; you need creatives that captivate, engage, and convert.

Welcome to the art of crafting¬†[**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-beginners-can-expect-from-amazon-fba/)¬†ads that not only catch the eye but also drive action. This guide will walk you through the creative strategies to transform your ads from mere placeholders into powerful, persuasive tools that turn casual browsers into eager buyers.

From dazzling listing images and compelling headlines to leveraging social proof and seasonal trends, we‚Äôll explore how to refine your ad creatives to achieve outstanding results. Ready to elevate your¬†Amazon FBA¬†ads and see those click-through rates soar?

# The Role of Listing Images in Amazon FBA Ads

Listing images¬†are often the first element a potential customer notices in your¬†Amazon FBA¬†ads. They serve as the visual hook that grabs attention and invites users to learn more about your product. High-quality listing images can communicate the product‚Äôs features, benefits, and usage, making them essential for compelling ad creatives.

**Example:**¬†If you‚Äôre advertising a premium coffee maker, a high-resolution image showcasing the sleek design and key features, such as programmable settings and a built-in grinder, can highlight the product‚Äôs value. In contrast, a blurry or poorly lit image may fail to convey these features effectively.

# Why High-Quality Listing Images Matter

High-quality¬†listing images¬†can significantly enhance your ad performance by improving click-through rates and conversion rates. They provide clarity and detail that help potential buyers make informed decisions.¬†

Quality listing images also help build trust by presenting your product in the best possible light, reflecting professionalism and attention to detail.

**Example:**¬†Consider an ad for a luxury watch. A high-quality image that captures the watch‚Äôs intricate details, such as its craftsmanship and fine materials, will attract buyers who appreciate luxury and quality. This level of detail is lost in low-resolution or poorly shot listing images.

# Characteristics of High-Quality Listing Images

To ensure your listing images stand out, they should possess several key characteristics:

# High Resolution

High-resolution¬†listing images¬†are crucial for maintaining clarity and detail. Listing images should be sharp and clear, even when zoomed in, to showcase the product‚Äôs quality and features.

**Example:**¬†For a high-end camera lens, a high-resolution image will allow potential buyers to see fine details like the lens‚Äôs build quality and the intricate design of its elements. Low-resolution listing images may appear pixelated or blurry, failing to highlight these aspects.

# Proper Lighting

Good lighting is essential for capturing accurate colors and details. Natural lighting or soft studio lighting can minimize shadows and reflections, providing a clear view of the product.

**Example:**¬†If you‚Äôre promoting a set of kitchen utensils, using soft, natural lighting can highlight the utensils‚Äô sleek design and color. Overly harsh lighting or shadows can obscure details and make the product look less appealing.

# Accurate Colors

Ensure that the colors in your¬†listing images¬†accurately represent the product. Misleading color representations can lead to customer dissatisfaction and increased returns.

**Example:**¬†An ad for a range of paint colors should use high-quality listing images that accurately depict each color, ensuring that buyers receive exactly what they expect. Incorrect color representation can result in negative reviews and customer complaints.

# Clear Focus

The product should be the main focal point of the image. Avoid cluttered backgrounds and ensure that the product is in sharp focus to draw attention to its features.

**Example:**¬†For a new smartphone, the image should clearly focus on the device itself, highlighting its screen and design. Background elements should be minimal and not distract from the product.

# Consistent Style

Maintain a consistent style across all your ad creatives to build brand recognition and create a cohesive visual experience. This includes using similar backgrounds, lighting, and image formats.

**Example:**¬†If your brand‚Äôs ads feature a clean, modern aesthetic, ensure that all product¬†listing images¬†adhere to this style. This consistency helps reinforce your brand‚Äôs identity and makes your ads more recognizable.

# Practical Tips for Selecting High-Quality Listing Images

Selecting the right¬†listing images¬†involves more than just choosing high-resolution photos. Here are practical tips to help you make the best choice:

# Showcase the Product in Use

[Lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/)¬†that show the product in use can be more engaging than static product shots. They help potential buyers visualize how the product fits into their lives.

**Example:**¬†For a new line of outdoor gear, an image of the gear being used on a hiking trail or at a campsite can make the product more relatable and appealing compared to a simple studio shot.

# Highlight Key Features

Focus on¬†listing images¬†that highlight the product‚Äôs key features and benefits. Close-up shots or detailed listing images can emphasize important aspects and differentiate your product from competitors.

**Example:**¬†If you‚Äôre advertising a high-tech blender, include close-up listing images of its control panel and blade system to showcase its advanced features.

# Use Multiple Angles

Provide¬†listing images¬†from multiple angles to give a comprehensive view of the product. This approach allows potential buyers to see the product from all sides and understand its design and functionality better.

**Example:**¬†For a piece of furniture, such as a sofa, include listing images showing the front, side, and back views, as well as close-ups of the fabric and stitching to give buyers a full understanding of its appearance and quality.

# Incorporate Contextual Elements

Contextual elements, such as props or backgrounds that reflect the product‚Äôs intended use, can make¬†listing images¬†more engaging and help potential buyers visualize the product in their own lives.

**Example:**¬†For a set of outdoor cooking tools, include listing images of the tools being used in a backyard BBQ setting. This helps buyers envision how they will use the product in their own outdoor gatherings.

# Optimize for Different Ad Formats

Different ad formats, such as sponsored product ads, display ads, and video ads, may require different image formats and resolutions. Ensure that your listing images are optimized for each format to maintain visual quality and effectiveness.

**Example:**¬†A product image used in a¬†[sponsored product ad](https://medium.com/amazon-selling-strategies/amazon-sponsored-product-ads-unlocking-the-potential-of-product-visibility-and-sales-growth-a567e207c8a0)¬†should be high-resolution and square, while¬†listing images¬†used in a video ad may need to be formatted to fit a widescreen aspect ratio.

# Examples of Effective High-Quality Listing images

# Luxury Product Example

For a high-end skincare product, a close-up image of the product with a clean, elegant background can emphasize its premium quality. The image should highlight the texture and¬†[product packaging](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-attractive-product-packaging-improves-amazon-fba-reviews/)¬†details, with soft lighting to enhance the product‚Äôs luxurious appeal.

# Tech Gadget Example

For a new smartwatch, an image showcasing the watch in use on a wrist with a modern, sleek background can demonstrate its functionality and style. Additional close-up shots of the watch face and band can highlight its features and design.

# Fashion Item Example

For a clothing item, such as a dress, use¬†listing images¬†of the dress being worn by a model in a stylish setting. Include close-ups of the fabric and details, as well as listing images of the dress from different angles to provide a comprehensive view.

# Designing Compelling Amazon FBA Ad Banners

Amazon FBA ad banners serve as visual advertisements that appear on various sections of the¬†Amazon FBA¬†website, including product detail pages, search results, and other placements. Their primary goal is to attract potential buyers‚Äô attention, convey key product information, and encourage clicks that lead to conversions.

Effective banners should blend seamlessly with the¬†Amazon FBA¬†environment while still standing out enough to capture the user‚Äôs eye.

# Key Elements of a Compelling Ad Banner

# ¬†Attention-Grabbing Visuals

The visual aspect of your ad banner is crucial for drawing users in. Use high-quality¬†listing images¬†that are relevant to your product and visually appealing. The imagery should be clear, crisp, and professionally designed to make a strong impression.

**Example:**¬†For a new line of kitchen appliances, use high-resolution listing images of the appliances in a well-lit kitchen setting. This creates a realistic scenario that helps users envision the product in their own homes.

# Clear and Concise Messaging

Your ad banner should convey its message quickly and effectively. Use concise, compelling text to highlight the key benefits or features of your product. Avoid cluttering the banner with excessive text; instead, focus on a single, impactful message.

**Example:**¬†If you‚Äôre promoting a sale on fitness equipment, your banner might feature the text ‚ÄúGet Fit Now ‚Äì 20% Off All Fitness Gear!‚Äù This message is clear and direct, making it easy for users to understand the offer.

# Strong Call-to-Action (CTA)

A strong¬†[call to action](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/11-call-to-action-hacks-to-boost-clicks-and-conversions/299618)¬†encourages users to take the next step, whether it‚Äôs clicking the banner to learn more, making a purchase, or exploring a special offer. Use action-oriented language and ensure that the CTA stands out visually.

**Example:**¬†For a new smartphone launch, your CTA could be ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù or ‚ÄúDiscover the Latest Features.‚Äù Make sure the CTA button is prominently placed and contrasts with the background to attract attention.

# Consistent Branding

Your ad banner should align with your brand‚Äôs overall look and feel. Use consistent colors, fonts, and design elements that reflect your brand identity. This consistency helps reinforce brand recognition and creates a cohesive experience across different ad placements.

**Example:**¬†If your brand‚Äôs color scheme includes blue and white, use these colors in your ad banner. This not only makes the banner visually appealing but also strengthens brand identity.

# Relevant and Engaging Content

Ensure that the content of your ad banner is relevant to the audience you‚Äôre targeting. Tailor your message and visuals to match the interests and needs of your potential customers. Engaging content increases the likelihood of attracting clicks and conversions.

**Example:**¬†If you‚Äôre targeting outdoor enthusiasts, an ad banner featuring high-quality¬†listing images¬†of camping gear with a message like ‚ÄúGear Up for Your Next Adventure‚Äù will resonate more with this audience.

# Best Practices for Designing Amazon FBA Ad Banners

# Optimize for Different Sizes

**Amazon FBA**¬†ad banners come in various sizes, and it‚Äôs essential to design banners that look great across all formats. Ensure that your design is adaptable and maintains its visual appeal and readability in different sizes.

**Example:**¬†Create multiple versions of your banner for different placements, such as a large rectangle for product detail pages and a smaller banner for search results. Test each version to ensure they perform well in their respective placements.

# Use High-Contrast Colors

High-contrast colors help your ad banner stand out against the background and grab attention. Choose color combinations that make your text and CTA buttons easy to read and visually striking.

**Example**: If your banner has a dark background, use light-colored text and buttons. Conversely, if the background is light, use darker text and buttons for better visibility.

# Incorporate Seasonal or Promotional Themes

Align your ad banners with seasonal events or promotions to make them more relevant and timelier. Incorporating holiday themes, special sales, or seasonal trends can increase engagement and drive more clicks.

* Example: For a summer sale, use vibrant colors and imagery related to summer activities, such as beach scenes or outdoor gatherings, along with a promotional message like ‚ÄúSummer Sale ‚Äì Up to 30% Off!‚Äù

# Ensure Mobile Compatibility

Many¬†[smartphone shoppers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/the-mobile-conundrum-optimizing-amazon-listings-for-smartphone-shoppers/)¬†browse Amazon¬†on mobile devices, so it‚Äôs crucial to ensure your ad banners are mobile-friendly. Design banners that look good on smaller screens and test their performance on various devices.

* Example: Use larger fonts and clear, simple¬†**listing images**¬†in mobile banners to ensure readability and visual appeal on smartphones and tablets.

# Test and Analyze Performance

Regularly test different designs, messages, and CTAs to determine what works best for your audience. Use Amazon‚Äôs ad performance metrics to analyze the effectiveness of your banners and make data-driven improvements.

* Example: Run A/B tests with different banner designs and monitor click-through rates, conversion rates, and other key metrics. Use this data to refine your ad creatives and enhance their performance.

# Examples of Effective Amazon FBA Ad Banners

# Product Launch Banner

For a new product launch, design a banner with a high-resolution image of the product, a bold headline announcing the launch, and a CTA like ‚ÄúExplore Now‚Äù or ‚ÄúPre-Order Today.‚Äù Ensure the banner reflects the product‚Äôs unique features and appeals to your target audience.

# Seasonal Sale Banner

Create a banner for a seasonal sale featuring vibrant, themed visuals and a promotional message such as ‚ÄúHoliday Savings ‚Äì 25% Off Everything!‚Äù Include a CTA button that encourages users to ‚ÄúShop the Sale‚Äù and make the offer clear and enticing.

# Brand Awareness Banner

For a brand awareness campaign, design a banner that showcases your brand‚Äôs logo, colors, and key messaging. Include a CTA like ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù or ‚ÄúDiscover Our Range‚Äù to drive traffic to your brand‚Äôs¬†Amazon FBA¬†storefront or website.

# Incorporating Clear Pricing Information in Ads

# Best Practices for Incorporating Pricing Information

# Display Pricing Prominently

Ensure that pricing information is easily visible in your ad. Place the price in a prominent location, such as near the center of the ad or in a large, eye-catching font. Avoid burying the price in the fine print or making it difficult to find.

* Example: In a banner ad for a new smartwatch, prominently feature the price in bold text, such as ‚ÄúOnly $199!‚Äù This clear and direct approach makes it easy for potential customers to see the cost at a glance.

# Highlight Discounts and Special Offers

If your ad includes special offers, discounts, or promotions, make sure these are highlighted effectively. Use attention-grabbing visuals or text to draw attention to the savings and create a sense of urgency.

* Example: For a limited-time sale, including text like ‚ÄúSave 20% ‚Äì Now Only $79.99!‚Äù in bright colors or with a contrasting background to emphasize the discount and encourage immediate action.

# Use Clear and Simple Language

Avoid jargon or complex pricing terms. Use straightforward language to explain the price and any associated costs. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that potential customers fully understand what they are paying for.

* Example: Instead of ‚Äú$49.99 plus taxes,‚Äù use ‚ÄúJust $49.99 ‚Äì No Hidden Fees!‚Äù to simplify the pricing message and make it more appealing.

# Include Pricing in Context

Provide context for the pricing information by including details about what the price covers. This can help justify the cost and highlight the value of the product.

* Example: If you‚Äôre advertising a subscription service, include text like ‚ÄúOnly $9.99 per month for unlimited access!‚Äù This informs customers about the ongoing cost and the benefits they receive for that price.

# Ensure Pricing Consistency

Maintain consistency between your ad pricing and the pricing on your landing page or product page. Inconsistencies can lead to confusion and erode trust, potentially causing customers to abandon their purchase.

* Example: If your ad states a price of $49.99, ensure that this is the same price displayed on the product detail page when customers click through from the ad.

# Use Pricing Comparisons Wisely

Incorporate pricing comparisons if they help emphasize the value of your offer. Highlight how your price compares to competitors or list the original price alongside the discounted price to showcase savings.

* Example: For a product previously priced at $79.99 now offered at $59.99, include text like ‚ÄúWas $79.99, Now Only $59.99!‚Äù to highlight the discount and value.

# Examples of Effective Pricing Information in Ads

# Product Launch Ad

For a new product launch, design an ad that prominently features the introductory price. Use engaging visuals and clear text to announce the launch price and any special promotions.

* Example: An ad for a new blender might feature a high-quality image of the product with the text ‚ÄúLaunch Special ‚Äì Just $89.99!‚Äù and a note that the price is available for a limited time only.

# Seasonal Sale Ad

During a seasonal sale, create an ad that highlights the discounted prices and any relevant seasonal themes. Use vibrant colors and compelling offers to attract attention and drive clicks.

* Example: For a summer sale, design an ad with bright, sunny visuals and text like ‚ÄúSummer Sale ‚Äì Up to 50% Off! Prices Start at $29.99!‚Äù to entice customers with attractive discounts.

# Subscription Service Ad

For a subscription-based product or service, clearly communicate the pricing and what‚Äôs included in the subscription. Use simple language and engaging visuals to explain the value proposition.

* Example: An ad for a streaming service could feature text like ‚ÄúUnlimited Streaming for Just $9.99 per Month!‚Äù with a clear breakdown of what the subscription includes, such as ‚ÄúNo Ads, Unlimited Downloads.‚Äù

# Limited-Time Offer Ad

When running a limited-time offer, create an ad that emphasizes the urgency of the promotion and clearly displays the discounted price. Include a strong call to action to encourage immediate purchases.

* Example: An ad for a limited-time gadget sale might say ‚ÄúFlash Sale ‚Äì Save 30% Now! Only $139.99 ‚Äì Limited Time Offer!‚Äù with a countdown timer or urgency message to prompt quick action.

# Designing Ad Creatives for Remarketing Campaigns

# Designing Effective Remarketing Ad Creatives

# Personalize Your Ads

Personalization is crucial in remarketing. Use data from previous interactions to tailor your ad creatives to the specific interests and behaviors of your target audience. Highlight products or services they viewed but did not purchase or offer related recommendations.

* Example: If a user visited your site and looked at several types of running shoes, create an ad showcasing those specific shoes with a message like, ‚ÄúStill Interested in These Running Shoes? Grab Them Now with 20% Off!‚Äù

# Utilize Dynamic Creative Elements

Dynamic ads automatically adjust their content based on user behavior and preferences. Incorporate dynamic elements like product¬†listing images, pricing, and promotions to make your ads more relevant and appealing.

* Example: For an e-commerce store, use dynamic remarketing ads that display the exact product the user viewed, along with real-time pricing and availability, to remind them of their interest and encourage a purchase.

# Highlight Special Offers and Discounts

If you‚Äôre running a promotion or discount, prominently feature it in your remarketing ads. Special offers can create a sense of urgency and incentivize users to finalize their purchase.

* Example: An ad for a limited-time offer might say, ‚ÄúExclusive Offer ‚Äì 25% Off Your Next Purchase! Use Code SAVE25 at Checkout.‚Äù This type of message encourages users to return and take advantage of the deal.

# ¬†Use Familiar Branding

Consistent branding helps reinforce brand recognition and recall. Incorporate your brand‚Äôs colors, logo, and visual style in your ad creatives to maintain a cohesive brand experience.

* Example: If your brand uses a specific color scheme and logo, ensure these elements are visible in your remarketing ads. This familiarity helps users recognize your brand and builds trust.

# Optimize for Mobile

Many users will encounter your remarketing ads on mobile devices, so it‚Äôs crucial to design ads that are optimized for smaller screens. Ensure your ad creatives are mobile-friendly with clear text and easily clickable buttons.

* Example: Design mobile ads with larger text and buttons that are easy to tap, ensuring users have a seamless experience when interacting with your ads on smartphones and tablets.

# Utilize High-Quality Visuals

High-quality visuals can significantly impact the effectiveness of your remarketing ads. Use clear, engaging listing images that showcase your products or services in a way that grabs attention and encourages users to take action.

* Example: For a luxury product, use high-resolution¬†listing images¬†that highlight the product‚Äôs features and quality. A visually appealing ad can attract users who may be considering a purchase.

# Incorporate Social Proof

Including elements of social proof, such as customer reviews, testimonials, or ratings, can enhance credibility and encourage users to trust your brand. Showcasing positive feedback can be particularly persuasive in remarketing ads.

* Example: Feature a testimonial in your ad that highlights a customer‚Äôs positive experience with your product, such as ‚ÄúLoved by Thousands ‚Äì Read Our 5-Star Reviews!‚Äù

# Test Different Ad Formats

Experiment with various ad formats to see which performs best for your audience. Test formats such as static¬†listing images, video ads, carousels, and interactive ads to determine what resonates most with your target market.

* Example: Run A/B tests comparing¬†[video product ads](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-amazon-video-product-ads-convert-better-the-power-of-visual-storytelling/)¬†showcasing your product in action versus static image ads with high-quality visuals to see which format drives more conversions.

# Track and Analyze Performance

Regularly monitor the performance of your remarketing ads to understand what‚Äôs working and what needs improvement. Use analytics tools to track metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and return on ad spend.

* Example: Analyze which ad creatives have the highest engagement and conversion rates. Use this data to refine your ad design and optimize your remarketing strategy.

# Examples of Remarketing Ad Creatives

# Abandoned Cart Ad

For users who added items to their cart but did not complete the purchase, create an ad that reminds them of their abandoned items and encourages them to finalize their purchase.

* Example: ‚ÄúYour Cart Awaits! Complete Your Purchase Now and Enjoy 15% Off. Shop Your Items Before They‚Äôre Gone!‚Äù

# Product Recommendation Ad

For users who viewed multiple products but didn‚Äôt buy, create an ad showcasing related products or complementary items to entice them back to your site.

* Example: ‚ÄúLoved Those Running Shoes? Check Out These Stylish Accessories to Match!‚Äù

# Seasonal Promotion Ad

For users who interacted with your brand during a specific season or event, design ads that promote seasonal offers or discounts.

* Example: ‚ÄúSpring Sale! Enjoy 20% Off All Items ‚Äì Shop Now and Refresh Your Wardrobe for the Season!‚Äù

# Customer Review Ad

Incorporate positive customer reviews into your remarketing ads to build trust and encourage users to return and make a purchase.

* Example: ‚ÄúSee Why Our Customers Love Us! ‚ÄòBest Purchase Ever‚Äô ‚Äì Get Yours Today with Free Shipping!‚Äù

# Using Amazon FBA Ad Reports to Refine Your Creatives

# Types of Reports:

* Campaign Performance Report: Provides an overview of how your campaigns are performing, including metrics like spend, clicks, and conversions.
* Search Term Report: This shows which search terms triggered your ads and how they performed, helping you understand user intent and optimize keyword targeting.
* Targeting Report: Details the performance of different targeting strategies, including automatic and manual targeting.
* Placement Report: Reveals how your ads are performing in different placements, such as top of search or product detail pages.

# Analyzing Ad Performance Metrics

# Evaluate Click-Through Rates (CTR)

Click-Through Rate (CTR) measures how often users click on your ad after seeing it. A high CTR indicates that your ad is compelling and relevant to your audience, while a low CTR may suggest that your creativity needs improvement.

* Example: If you notice a low CTR for an ad, consider adjusting the headline or¬†[main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-products-main-image/)¬†to make it more engaging. Test different variations to see which one resonates better with your audience.

# Review Conversion Rates

Conversion Rate measures the percentage of users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase, after clicking on your ad. High conversion rates indicate that your ad creatives are effective at driving sales, while low conversion rates may suggest that there‚Äôs a disconnect between the ad and the landing page.

* Example: If your ad has a high CTR but low conversion rates, it might be a sign that the landing page needs to be more aligned with the ad‚Äôs message or offer. Ensure that the user experience from ad clicks to purchases is seamless.

# Assess Cost-Per-Click (CPC) and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA)

Cost-per-click (CPC) is the amount you pay for each click on your ad, while Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) is the amount you spend to acquire a customer. A high CPC or CPA can indicate that your ad creatives are not effectively driving value hence¬†[low CPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-lower-amazon-cpc-get-the-best-value-for-every-penny/)¬†should be the seller‚Äôs goal.¬†

* Example: If you‚Äôre seeing a high CPC but low conversion rates, consider optimizing your ad creatives to improve relevance and engagement, which can help reduce costs and increase ROI.

# Analyze Impressions and Spend

Impressions indicate how often your ad is shown, and spending reflects the total amount you‚Äôve invested in your ads. A high number of impressions with low engagement may suggest that your ad needs to be more appealing or targeted.

* Example: If your ad has high impressions but low clicks, it might be necessary to refine your ad copy or visuals to better capture user interest and encourage clicks.

# Using Insights to Refine Your Ad Creatives

# Optimize Ad Copy and Visuals

Use insights from your reports to make data-driven adjustments to your ad copy and visuals. Focus on elements that have underperformed and test new variations to improve performance.

* Example: If a certain headline or image is not performing well, try experimenting with different headlines or visuals that might better capture your audience‚Äôs attention and drive higher engagement.

# Adjust Targeting and Keywords

Analyze the Search Term Report and Targeting Report to refine your keyword strategy and targeting options. Focus on high-performing keywords and consider excluding low-performing ones.

* Example: If certain search terms are generating high clicks and conversions, incorporate those terms into your ad copy and targeting strategy to enhance relevance and performance.

# Refine Ad Placement

Review the Placement Report to understand where your ads perform best. Adjust your ad placement strategy based on where your ads are getting the most engagement and conversions.

* Example: If your ads perform better at the top of search results compared to product detail pages, consider adjusting your bid strategy to prioritize placements that yield better results.

# Test and Iterate

Continuously test different ad creatives based on insights from your reports. A/B testing various ad elements can help you identify what resonates best with your audience and refine your approach over time.

* Example: Run A/B tests with different headlines,¬†listing images, or CTAs to determine which variations lead to higher CTRs and conversion rates. Use these findings to inform future and creative designs.

# Monitor Competitive Performance

Use¬†Amazon FBA¬†Ad Reports to benchmark your performance against competitors. Understanding how your ads stack up can provide additional insights into areas for improvement.

* Example: If you notice that competitors are achieving higher engagement with certain types of ads, analyze their strategies and consider incorporating similar elements into your own campaigns.

# Examples of Using Ad Reports to Refine Creatives

# Low CTR Scenario

If an ad has a low CTR, analyze the ad‚Äôs headline and image. For instance, if your ad‚Äôs headline reads ‚ÄúBuy Now,‚Äù and CTR is low, consider testing a more compelling headline like ‚ÄúLimited-Time Offer: 20% Off ‚Äì Shop Now!‚Äù to increase clicks.

# High CPC Scenario

If you‚Äôre experiencing high CPC with low conversions, review your ad‚Äôs relevance to the landing page. For example, if your ad promotes a discount on a product but the landing page doesn‚Äôt highlight the discount, adjust the landing page to align with the ad‚Äôs message.

# High Impressions, Low Engagement Scenario

If an ad has high impressions but low engagement, consider improving the ad‚Äôs visual appeal. For instance, if your ad‚Äôs image is generic and not eye-catching, replace it with a high-quality, relevant image that better represents your product.

# Incorporating Seasonal Themes in Your Ads

# Identifying Relevant Seasonal Themes

# Major Holidays

Major holidays like Christmas, Halloween, and Easter offer significant opportunities for themed ads. Tailoring your ads to these holidays can help you capitalize on the increased consumer spending associated with these periods.

* Example: For Christmas, use festive imagery, holiday-themed promotions, and messages like ‚ÄúCelebrate the Season with 20% Off Your Favorite Gifts!‚Äù

# Seasonal Events

Seasonal events such as back-to-school, summer vacations, or spring cleaning provide a chance to align your ads with relevant consumer needs and behaviors.

* Example: For back-to-school season, create ads highlighting school supplies, apparel, or educational products with messages like ‚ÄúGet Ready for Back-to-School ‚Äì Shop Our Top Picks Now!‚Äù

# Weather-Related Themes

Weather patterns and seasonal changes, like summer or winter, can be incorporated into your ads to reflect current conditions and consumer needs.

* Example: For summer, promote products like sunscreen or outdoor gear with ads saying, ‚ÄúStay Cool This Summer with Our Must-Have Outdoor Essentials!‚Äù

# Annual Sales Events

Annual sales events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and¬†[Prime Day](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-prepare-amazon-prime-day-coupons-and-exclusive-deals/)¬†are key opportunities for seasonal advertising. Tailor your ads to highlight special deals and offers during these high-traffic periods.

* Example: For Black Friday, create ads showcasing exclusive discounts and limited-time offers with messaging like ‚ÄúBlack Friday Blowout ‚Äì Save Big on All Your Favorites!‚Äù

# Designing Seasonal Ad Creatives

# Use Relevant Imagery

Incorporate visuals that reflect the seasonal theme of your ad. Seasonal imagery can create an immediate connection with the audience and enhance the overall appeal of your ad.

* Example: For a winter-themed ad, use¬†listing images¬†of snowflakes, cozy sweaters, or holiday decorations. For a summer ad, include bright colors, beach scenes, or summer activities.

# Tailor Your Messaging

Craft your ad copy to align with the seasonal theme. Use language and messaging that resonate with the current season or event, and emphasize any relevant promotions or offers.

* Example: For a Valentine‚Äôs Day ad, use romantic language like ‚ÄúSpread the Love with Our Valentine‚Äôs Day Specials ‚Äì Shop Now and Save!‚Äù

# Highlight Seasonal Promotions

Feature seasonal promotions, discounts, or offers prominently in your ads. Special deals tied to the season can drive urgency and encourage immediate purchases.

* Example: For a spring sale, your ad could say, ‚ÄúSpring into Savings ‚Äì Enjoy 30% Off All Spring Styles. Limited Time Only!‚Äù

# Adjust Ad Formats

Consider using different ad formats to better align with seasonal themes. For example, carousel ads can showcase a range of seasonal products, while¬†[video ads](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-use-amazon-video-ads-to-boost-your-amazon-sales-in-2024/)¬†can highlight seasonal events or promotions.

* Example: A carousel ad for summer could feature multiple¬†listing images¬†of summer products like swimwear, sunglasses, and beach towels, each with a different promotion.

# Incorporate Seasonal Branding

Align your branding with the seasonal theme to create a cohesive and immersive experience. Use seasonal colors, fonts, and designs that complement the theme of your ad.

* Example: For a Halloween-themed ad, use orange and black colors, spooky fonts, and Halloween-related graphics to enhance the seasonal feel.

# Examples of Seasonal Ads

# ¬†Holiday Promotions

During the holiday season, ads can focus on gift-giving and festive celebrations.

* Example: ‚ÄúHoliday Sale Extravaganza ‚Äì Find the Perfect Gift for Everyone on Your List and Save Up to 50%!‚Äù

# ¬†Summer Sales

Summer-themed ads can promote products relevant to the season, such as outdoor gear or summer apparel.

* Example: ‚ÄúSummer Clearance ‚Äì Up to 40% Off All Swimwear and Outdoor Essentials. Shop the Sale Today!‚Äù

# ¬†Back-to-School Campaigns

Back-to-school ads can highlight school supplies, backpacks, and educational tools.

* Example: ‚ÄúBack-to-School Sale ‚Äì Stock Up on Supplies and Save Big! Shop Our Best Deals for Students and Teachers.‚Äù

# ¬†New Year‚Äôs Promotions

New Year‚Äôs ads can focus on setting goals, new beginnings, and fresh starts.

* Example: ‚ÄúNew Year, New You ‚Äì Start 2024 with a Fresh Look. Enjoy 25% Off Storewide for a Limited Time!‚Äù

1g1aren,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g1aren/europamundo_tour_extremely_frustrating/,Europamundo Tour Extremely Frustrating,"Just returned home from Tour EM069758, Beautiful Norway and Nordic Capitals.. Wouldn‚Äôt do it again if was even offered free! We are seasoned travellers having visited 80 countries on nearly a couple dozen motorcoach and cruise tours as clients, in addition to working for a dozen years as professional tour directors for five different companies providing tours around North America. So we have a pretty good idea of what minimum standards should be expected. Our complaints encompass ALL aspects of the trip incl. the itinerary, the hotels, the guides, and the motor coaches.

¬†

¬†Itinerary :

¬†

1) Two of the first five days had their first stop 2.5 hours after starting. With no WC on the bus that is too long.

¬†2) Stockholm to Copenhagen first stop was 3.25 hours after starting. WC on bus was locked. Driver said was not working, but we all know how much drivers dislike servicing that item on the bus.

¬†3 Oslo to Stockholm was a 12 hour day and when we arrived at the hotel, the only choices for getting a meal were the expensive hotel restaurant or a Subway. Bergen to Oslo was also a 12 hour run. Stops were too long.

¬†4) If stops were made to allow passengers time to take the boat tour at Geiranger or the Glacier tour at Briksdal, they should have been included in the package because that left the passengers who didn‚Äôt do them with two and a half hours with nothing to do! Briksdal had one souvenir shop and that was it! Geieranger had a few more but not enough to fill that much time in.

¬†5) The only available WCs at Gieranger cost 22 K. a ridiculous fee and one that should have been covered by Europamundo if they were not going to provide WCs on the coach.

6) Bergen - bus left a half hour after the restaurant opened. Ridiculous!!!!

¬†7) Drop offs after city tours in Oslo and Copenhagen were downtown with no provision offered for transportation back to the hotel at the end of the tour, or later.

¬†

¬†Motor Coaches.

¬†

¬†1) First one didn‚Äôt have a WC and the last two did, but were kept locked.

¬†2) No USB available on a coach except for Oslo to Copenhagen leg.

¬†

¬†Hotels:

  


¬†1) Mostly remote and away from other restaurants or shopping.

¬†2) Loen. No kettle or coffee pot provided. Only one available plug in. Third person fold away bed had springs poking through the mattress so badly that they had to bring in anoth mattress to put on top.

¬†3) Oslo - We were the only ones from the tour that were supposed to stay at that hotel and we weren‚Äôt on their list. Waited a half hour to get a room.

¬†4) Bergen - Crazy electrical wiring in room. Central switch turned everything off incl the wall sockets. The only way I could use my CPAP machine for the night was to unscrew a bulb in the ceiling.

¬†5) Stockholm - also no room coffee or kettle.

¬†6) Most hotels did not even provide facial tissue. One was supposed to buy a box and carry it with them the whole trip?

¬†

¬†Guides:

¬†

¬†Guides were basically knowledgeable and good, but it would have been nice if the giude offering the English version had English as their first language, not their second. Was often difficult with their accents to understand everything they were saying. And although we knew it was to be a bilingual tour, it became very annoying spending hours over the course of the trip having to endure listening to loud stories in a language you don‚Äôt understand. It would be lik driving through a foreign country in a car with the radio on that provided only dialogue. You wouldn‚Äôt do it!

¬†

¬†And the most frustrating part of the whole tour was the end!! When I booked the tour in early May, the itinerary said we would be staying at the Moxy Sydhavn in Copenhagen. We planned to stay a couple extra days in Copenhagen, and not wanting the trouble of switching hotels, we booked two extra nights there at a cost of over $600. for a non changeable, non refundable reservation.We had the option of paying over a hundred dollars more for cancellation privileges, but I declined as we have trip cancellation insurance. What I didn‚Äôt anticipate was Europamundo changing the hotel to Comwell at the other end of the city! This meant a time wasted hassle and the expense of the transportation to move. I complained to your agent on your chat line, but got nowhere, not even agreeing to cover the taxi bill.",2,1728655970.0,travel,0,0.75,False
