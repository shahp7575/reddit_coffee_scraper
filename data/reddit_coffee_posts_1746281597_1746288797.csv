1kdwfnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1kdwfnr/what_to_do_with_a_3_month_old/,What to do with a 3 month old,"Hi everyone

Just doing my firat solo parenting day with my 11 (almost 12) week old, and realising it's pretty hard and boring at the same time 😳
She's been a little cranky recently so that's not helping for sure. 
She always wakes up cheerful, lots of smiles, has a really good look around the bedroom in the daylight and is happy doing so. I put her in her swing in the kitchen while I make coffee and breakfast and she's usually pretty chill until she starts to feel tired again (this is a multiple times a day fight with herself about napping). 
So outside of napping and feeding today we've done (to varying degrees of success): 

Tummy time 
Playmat 
Reading books 
Showing her pictures in the house 
Showing her everything in the garden 
Dance party with music 

I sing to her loads, I try to help her practice her growing skills (rolling and grabbing), and I wear her to get her to have  decent sleep (she will fall asleep in her bed after 10 mins of crying and wake up 25-45 mins later, never any longer). 

I did all the above until she was no longer happy doing them. And it just seems like she's noonger happy doing them very quickly? What else is there to do? I take her out a few times a week but because she's so little and in the pram I feel like she's not really seeing anything new anyway? And because wake windows are so short at this age she's almost always needing a sleep shortly after going out anyway (sometimes manages half an hour in the pram). 

I've just got her to sleep again in the carrier quite easily after 1 HR 15 awake. 

She gets between 3-5 hours sleep during the day depending how much she fights against the naps. 

I guess my questions are, are there other things I can do? Is she miserable because she's tired even after waking up from a 2 hour nap in the carrier (she yawns all day, after waking, mid wake window, end of wake window)? 

Some days she's a delight other than the nap fighting, but sometimes just nothing will make her happy and I'm counting down the minutes till I can get her to sleep again. 

She does seem to react well to something new, like a new person visiting or taking her somewhere she's not been before. Is she bored? 

Sorry this turned into a bit of a ramble, I just want her to be happy and I'm not sure what else to do. 

Thank you if you read this far lol 

Edit to add: 
She loves the TV. Has done since week 1. Stares at it, and will actively turn away from anything else she is doing to watch it. We usually just have on retro games on twitch so she's seeing a lot of just bright colours really. But sometimes it's the only way to keep her chill for a few minutes.",1,1746288371.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,0,1.0,False
1kdwf2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdwf2z,Lost a black rifle coffee company hat- can anyone help?,"My partner lost his black rifle coffee company hat that he had for several years. It did not have a mesh back. I’ve been checking Depop, fb marketplace, and several other second hand places and even talked to BRCC to see if they had any leads on how to get one and haven’t been able to find this hat at all. 

There’s currently one they sell that does have a mesh back. He wore this hat all the time and it had a lot of significance to him and I’ve bought two similar types but he isn’t as fond of them. 

Can anyone help? Am I just doomed to searching for it every week in hopes someone tries to sell one?

1kdwdvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kdwdvf/a_day_from_hell/,A day from hell.,"He's been having a rough day since morning. While eating breakfast, someone bumped into him, spilling coffee and staining his clothes.

Although he had brought old clothes for this trip, intending to discard them after wearing them once to reduce the weight of his return luggage, he had calculated the number of outfits precisely. This unexpected situation was giving him a bit of a headache.

The trip was nearing its end, and buying new clothes on the spur of the moment would be a waste of time and money. He returned to his room and opened his suitcase. Inside, besides the souvenirs he was bringing for others, were clothes he had bought as mementos.

Among them was a T-shirt he had bought at a traditional market. The peculiar pattern on it looked very ethnic. The stall owner was initially unwilling to sell it, but what can't a Washington solve? Two Washingtons, then.

Besides, this was a developing country. If you wanted to escape a life where you could only rely on divine blessings, you had to properly respect banknotes.

Changing into that T-shirt, he continued his itinerary for the day.

After walking out of the hotel entrance, he felt several pairs of eyes fixed on him.

Or rather, the local residents he encountered all had strange expressions.

Muttering to himself, he got into a local taxi. ""I want to go to—""

‘Ga Wen Ta Shrine, you want to go.'The driver confirmed in broken English.

""Yeah, that's right."" Although he felt a bit odd, that shrine was actually a very unpopular tourist spot, and he was happy to avoid the hassle of complicated communication.

The driver grinned, pressed the central locking button, and drove towards the shrine, occasionally glancing at the man wearing the T-shirt with the ancient word ""sacrifice"" printed on it to see if he was sitting still.


What a lucky day today turned out to be!

I’m a 20 yr old student. He’s 36. 
We met in a gallery and he immediately caught my eyes. Not hot in a basic way but he was the kind of man who was strangely comforting to look at. 
He called me dangerous. Said I reminded him of the girl he should’ve married. Said I made him feel young and alive and ruined all at once. And I liked it. I have always liked attention, but from him- it was amazing. 

It started with coffee. Then late-night drives. Then hotel rooms. I tried so many things with this guy.

One day he told me he was divorced. Of course I believed him. I mean I wanted to believe him.
God, I was fcking stupid looking back now.

Tonight, I snuck out to meet him. I said I was with a friend. My mom didn’t buy it. Of course she didn’t. I guess she followed me. I don’t know how long she was watching, but she saw us. She also saw when he kissed my forehead before I got in his car.

I got a text 20 minutes later:
“Come home. Now.” Dude i knew it was over for me.

When I walked through the door, both my parents were waiting. I’ve never seen my dad that angry and upset. My mom just asked me:
“Does his wife know where he is tonight?”

I didn’t even have time to react.
Because she already called her. Turns out my mother knew ‘my’ man and also his wife 💀 I have been fucked TWICE. Not only did he have a wife- he also knew my parents?!

Later on his actual wife had a talk with me even though I did not want to and denied everything. She said I wasn’t the first. But hopefully the last. I’m so ashamed. 

Gosh I cried like a baby. I’m 20. I’m so dumb and naive, falling for guys that could be my father. He hasn’t messaged me. I don’t think he ever will.

But the worst part?

I still want him to.

1kdwbqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperMorbidlyObese/comments/1kdwbqq/updatestill_at_it/,Update-Still at it,"I joined Reddit about a month ago just to follow this site. I have not been as successful as I had hoped but I'm moving in the right direction. This sub has been invaluable. Everyone is so supportive and the advice has been spot on.   
Quick recap: I started in Jan. 2025. My insurance denied Zepbound so doing my best on my own. 

F55-5'8""-SW: 347 CW: 320 1st target: 315lbs  
My goal was to be at or below 315lbs at my follow-up dr. appt. at the end of April.  I missed that target and weighed in at 326 I embarrassingly sobbed in the dr.s office\~I have been working so hard. He assured me that I was on the right track and was so supportive but I felt like I hadn't lost like everyone who've I've been following online. 

Yesterday I had an unrelated appt. I weight 320 lbs. -still going in the right direction. I have an appt. for my sleep study coming up this month and hopefully will meet that first 315 lb goal. I have increased my walking,  I have upped my water consumption & only drinking my morning coffee & water, I've been journaling everything that I eat, and I'm at a steep calorie deficit.  I am not restricting foods-only portions. I am being mindful of every choice but there are still times when I don't make the best ones. 

**My wins this past month:**  
I have avoided the break room at work where there is an endless supply of treats set out. When I do grab something, I journal it and count it in my daily calories.  I was in charge of bringing in the cake for a close coworker's birthday last week so it was difficult to avoid.  I cut myself only a half slice. Then, I declined to take the leftovers home when offered. These are HUGE wins for me.     
  
Win #2: I was running on low on laundry since life has been insane. I had to pull from a little deeper into my work pants stock-been wearing the same 6-7 pair all winter. When I put the pants on (all the same brand/same size), they felt tight. I was so discouraged. They didn't look bad, they fit, just felt a little snug all over again - the problem I was having in Dec/Jan. I had convinced myself that my pants were fitting looser lately but putting on a pair that weren't as well worn showed that the weight loss wasn't making a difference in clothing YET. It was a gut kick and I was so discouraged. Normally that would send me into a 'give up' spiral -Instead I pushed through it, didn't derail my day and realized that I was just going to have to work harder. That was a HUGE win for me.   
  
Well as I was doing laundry I noticed that these pants were a size down from my regular work pants! They were an older pair that I was saving 'in case' I ever lost the weight. I went up to my current size almost 4 yrs ago (COVID) & those were starting to get tight. I was terrified about needed to go up another size. I have no idea how these older pants became mixed in with my current pants (I'm a bit of a clothes hoarder & have so many old clothes in MANY sizes squirreled about) but there they were-and they fit again.  I comfortably wore them all day at work. So while I may have missed my first weight loss goal in the timeframe that I set, I am moving in the right direction. It feels pretty good. 

I rewarded myself with ordering a new scale from Amazon (my old on doesn't weigh over 300lbs- old dial type).  I'm going to make this work.  Thank you all - you are inspirational.",4,1746288094.0,SuperMorbidlyObese,1,1.0,False

But when we video called, she never wanted to show her face — always saying her hair was messy.

Later, she told me she had autism. Our conversations were super one-sided. She’d cancel plans last minute, like saying she hurt her leg. Then she’d claim I was treating her differently after knowing about her autism. She told me her ex abandoned her, that she was replaced by another guy, and she’d constantly vent about her family and autistic nephews.

One time, I was mugged and nearly lost her number — she barely reacted, saying she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first.

When I finally asked her on a proper date to the movies, she said she was too shy, then agreed, then right before said, “Shouldn’t we just be friends?” But we went, kissed, and spent the day together romantically. She stayed very guarded, wouldn’t let me see her phone, didn’t share her Instagram (only gave it after we broke up).

Another time at a motel, she said we couldn’t turn the lights on because she was too embarrassed — I said it was fine, but her mood switched instantly. She didn’t want me meeting her family, got mad when I teased her about never going out, and would overreact when I criticized little things, like a game we played.

She invited me to a party, then uninvited me, then changed her mind again. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend, but at one point, she joked about helping me find a “hot girl” on a dating app.

Eventually, after all these ups and downs, I broke up with her over the phone. She cried, blocked me, later messaged saying I ruined her happiness, sent her to the psych clinic, and that she missed me more than she expected.

We talked again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I asked, she claimed she was searching for her friend’s ex. I told her I loved her, she said she wished I had been somewhere she went recently, and later called me to invite me to her mom’s birthday. I didn’t go. Her mom called asking if I loved her, then invited me over for coffee.

We spoke again, but she said her dad was mad at me. I got upset and vented online. She found the post and told me I had deceived and used her, that all of this was because she was insecure and autistic, that she had prayed for me every day — then she blocked me and disappeared.

So… am I overreacting for feeling completely drained, walking away, and wondering if I was unfair? Everyone around her is acting like I’m the bad guy.",2,1746288033.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1kdw91t,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1kdw91t/bong_appétit/,Bong Appétit,"Chapter 1: Smoke and Skill

Danny Moreno had been smoking weed since he was fifteen. He wasn’t one of those weekend warriors or the “take a hit before bed” types. He was an everyday lifer. Wake-and-bake before breakfast, smoke breaks instead of lunch, and nightly bowls that scorched the glass of his favorite bong, Veronica. She was cracked on one side but still ripped like a freight train.

Danny wasn’t just a stoner. He was a connoisseur. He’d smoked strains that were grown in caves, lit bowls on a mountaintop with nothing but sunlight and a magnifying glass, and even hit a blunt laced with powdered mushrooms at a desert rave. That one ended with him hugging a cactus he thought was his dead uncle. He didn’t regret it.

But with every hit, his tolerance climbed. What used to send him giggling into the clouds now barely made his eyes red. Lately, nothing hit the same. Not even that small-batch strain called Widow’s Grin that was banned in three states.

What Danny lacked in mass, he made up for in an iron stomach and sharp hands. When he wasn’t high, he was in the kitchen, cooking, experimenting with different food. His top skills involved infusing oils, grilling steaks and baking cakes from scratch. His fridge was stocked like a Food Network set, not a stoner den. He could deglaze a pan better than most chefs and turn leftovers into gourmet meals. But he never gained a pound—just a metabolism that ran hotter than his gas stove

His two obsessions—weed and food—ruled his world. But both were starting to feel dull.

Until he found the ad.

It was 2:37 AM. Danny sat in his smoke-hazy room, half-watching a cooking video while scrolling through Craigslist for weird kitchen gear or “ethically questionable” edibles. That’s when he saw it:

“Hungry for the best high of your life? Starving for something real? 

Email the Reaper. One taste and you’ll never be the same.”

Reply to: (starvingforthis420@cryptmail.com)

He chuckled. “Reaper, huh?” Still, the wording stuck with him. Starving for something real.

He hit up his best friend, Kyle—another heavy smoker with a stomach like a void.

10:41 PM
DANNY: Bro. Just found the sketchiest ad on Craigslist. Dude calls himself the Reaper. Wants to feed us “the best high of our lives.”

10:42 PM
KYLE: LOL that sounds like a trap. Send it to me.

Danny forwarded the email to his friend. Then, with a crack of his knuckles, he began to type:

Subject: That Starving Shit

Yo,

I saw your ad on Craigslist. I’ve smoked a lot, and I mean a lot. If this is legit, I want in. Let me know where to meet.

Danny M.

A reply came five minutes later.

No words. Just an address.

“123 Rotterman Ave – Back Entrance”

Danny Googled it. The place was listed as condemned. Used to be a chip factory. Now it was just a black mark on the map.

He screenshotted the location and sent it to Kyle.

10:44 PM
DANNY:

DANNY:

KYLE:

DANNY:
Perfect.


Chapter 2: Craigslist Curiosity

The next afternoon, the sky looked sick. Pale gray with ribbons of darker clouds like bruises across the horizon. Danny stood outside his apartment, hoodie on, vape pen in his pocket, and Veronica tucked in a duffel bag. Kyle pulled up in his beat-to-hell Civic, bass rattling like it was held together with duct tape and weed crumbs.

“You ready to meet the Craigslist crypt keeper?” Kyle grinned as Danny climbed in.

“I was born ready to die from questionable decisions,” Danny said, slapping Kyle’s shoulder.

They punched the address into Maps: 123 Rotterman Ave. No reviews. No photos. No listing. The GPS guided them out of the city, past the suburbs, and into the industrial edges where factories slept behind rusted fences and the only people around were strays or squatters.

They pulled up to a massive, rotting building. The sign was mostly torn down, just a warped metal frame and half the word CHIPS left dangling. But neither of them had heard of this place before.

“What even was this?” Kyle muttered.

“Factory of some kind. Looks like it’s been dead a while. You ever been out here?”

Kyle shook his head. “No clue this place existed. Feels… off.”

The back entrance was a dented steel door propped open with a broken brick. The inside was dark except for streaks of dying sunlight through shattered windows. They stepped in. The air smelled like old grease, mold, and something sweet and rotting.

“Dude… this is some Blair Witch shit,” Kyle whispered, looking around.

Footsteps echoed. From the shadows emerged a man.

He looked like he’d crawled out of a mass grave. Shirtless, skin sallow and patchy. Bite marks ran across his arms and chest—deep ones. Flesh was missing in chunks, raw meat glistening beneath. One eye was swollen shut, the other darted between them like it was starving.

He was chewing on something.

At first, Danny thought it might’ve been gum—but as the man stepped closer, he noticed the man’s fingers. Most of them were missing their tips. Gnawed down to the first and second knuckle, raw and glistening, with dark scabs clinging like barnacles. One stump twitched as he brought it to his mouth and gave it an absentminded nibble, like it was just a bad habit.

“You Danny?” the man rasped, licking his lips slowly with a cracked tongue.

Danny swallowed his nerves. “Yeah.”

“You got cash?” the man said. This time he stared off into the distance, as if spaced out in his head. 

Danny nodded, pulling out a wad. “You got the weed?”

The dealer reached into a sagging black sack and pulled out a vacuum-sealed bag. Inside was bud the color of sickly purple veins, sticky and thick with trichomes. A small tag on the bag read:

“Deadhead OG: One hit and you’ll eat your own heart out.”

Danny raised a brow. “That’s… bold branding.”

The man smiled wide, revealing teeth that looked chipped and red at the roots. “Only for those who can handle it.”

They made the exchange. But as soon as the cash hit his hand, the dealer’s smile collapsed into a snarl. He lunged at Kyle.

Kyle screamed as the man tackled him to the ground, gnashing at his neck, fingernails clawing like hooked bone. 

“FUCK!” Danny yelled, pulling the only weapon he had—his glass bong.

With a scream, Danny smashed Veronica down on the dealer’s skull. The thick glass cracked but didn’t shatter. He hit again. And again. The third hit made a wet crunch, and the dealer dropped.

Kyle pushed him off, panting, blood on his shirt but unharmed. “Jesus, bro…”

They stood over the twitching, ruined thing on the ground. One last bubble of breath gurgled from the man’s throat. Then nothing.

Danny looked down at the dealer’s hand, the mangled stumps of his fingers still twitching.

“…he was eating himself,” Danny said softly.

Kyle just shook his head in disbelief.

Danny grabbed the bag of weed and looked at Kyle. “We earned this.”

“…You’re seriously taking it?” Kyle questioned, a look of concern flooded his face.

“We came all this way,” Danny said, a wide smirk slithering across his face. He knew it was a selfish act but something crept into his head, promising a high that he’s never felt before. 


Chapter 3: The Chip Factory

They didn’t say a word for the first fifteen minutes of the drive back. Just silence, except for Kyle’s ragged breathing and the occasional wet drip of blood from his shirt onto the Civic’s floor mats.

When they got back to Danny’s place, they both sat in the living room, staring at the bag of weed on the coffee table like it was radioactive.

“Dude,” Kyle finally said, “we just fucking killed that guy.”

Danny lit a cigarette with shaking hands. “He tried to eat you, man. That was self-defense.”

Kyle nodded, but his leg kept bouncing. “Yeah. But still. What the hell was that place? And his body? Did you see it?”

Danny remembered. The open wounds. The missing flesh. Like he’d been half-consumed—and not by animals. By teeth.

“His skin looked chewed, bro,” Kyle said. “Like, gnawed on. Even his own arms.”

Danny didn’t answer. Instead, he grabbed his scale, broke the seal on the bag, and poured out the bud onto a tray. The room instantly filled with the pungent, musky scent—something like death slowly mixed with berries, both ripe and spoiled.

They both stared at the strain name again.

Deadhead OG

Kyle read the fine print out loud: “One hit and you’ll eat your own heart out.”

“Is that a joke?” he asked.

Danny laughed hollowly. “I mean, zombie theme is on-brand, right? ‘Deadhead’? Could be a gimmick. Edgy marketing.”

He started weighing it out, measuring with precision.

“14 grams each,” Danny said. “Fair split.”

They sat there for a while in the weed haze, trying to make sense of what had happened. Eventually the conversation got deep, like it always did after too many hits.

“What if we’re just chasing highs because nothing else gives us anything anymore?” Kyle said, staring at the ceiling. “Like… maybe we’re already dead inside. Maybe that guy? He was just farther along.”

Danny thought for a second. “Or maybe we’re not dead… just numb. And we keep trying to wake up.”

“Maybe,” Kyle said. “Or maybe we’re already in Hell, and weed just makes it more comfortable.”

They both laughed. A sad, tired laugh.

Eventually, Kyle stood, stretching his back. “I’m gonna crash at my place. I need to clean this blood off before it stains. You good?”

“Yeah,” Danny said. “I’ll chill, mess with the new strain. Let you know how it hits.”

Before heading out, they locked eyes and gave each other the hang loose—thumb and pinky out, the Shaka brah. Their hands met in a quick, practiced touch, fingers brushing just enough to feel familiar. It was their usual sendoff, half joke, half ritual.

Kyle nodded, grabbed his keys, and left.

A minute later, Danny spotted the other half of the split—Kyle’s weed—still sitting on the table.

“Stoner move,” he muttered. “I’ll give it to him tomorrow.”

He grabbed his grinder, broke up a fat nug. It was denser than anything he’d ever touched, sticky as syrup, and the grinder jammed twice trying to tear it apart. He packed Veronica’s slightly cracked bowl and flicked the lighter.


Chapter 4: Inferno in a Bong

The flame hissed as it touched the bowl, and Deadhead OG lit up like it was alive—orange fractures crackling through purple flesh, releasing a smoke that spiraled unnaturally, thick as fog.

Danny inhaled.

Hoooooooooo

The hit punched his lungs like a cinderblock. He coughed so hard he nearly blacked out, clutching his chest, eyes tearing, veins in his neck straining.

Then everything slowed.

His couch seemed to stretch ten feet. The walls rippled like heat waves. Colors reversed—blue became orange, red turned to ghostly white. Shadows crawled, but they weren’t cast by anything.

Danny grinned. His fingers tingled, buzzing. He felt light, like his bones were helium-filled. His heartbeat sounded like distant tribal drums—ancient and primal.

Then came the voices.

Not actual voices—more like urges, raw and insistent.

Eat. Eat. Feed.

He gave a shaky laugh and rubbed his temples. 

The munchies hit like an avalanche. His stomach twisted, a ravenous beast clawing to be fed. He stumbled into the kitchen, tearing open cabinets, the fridge, everything.

Cereal. Chips. Beef jerky. Even a banana. He tore through each one, waiting for something to land—but nothing hit. The flavors were just… gone. Foods that usually slapped now tasted like cardboard. No salt, no sweetness, no satisfaction. Just empty bites and a growing unease.

Danny dragged his haul into the living room, plopped in front of the TV, and started shoving more food in his face.

He ate fast. Unhinged. Cheeks bulging, crumbs everywhere.

He expected the flavors to explode—sweet, salty, something—but all he got was emptiness. Each bite felt like chewing air. The nothingness clung to his tongue, dull and stubborn, refusing to let anything through.

There was a strange, slick pop—quiet, almost delicate. Then came the warmth.

He looked down.

Blood.

His finger was in his mouth, and he wasn’t just biting it—he’d chewed through the skin. A small crescent of flesh was gone, torn clean from the tip.

Pain hit first, sharp and blinding. But right behind it, curling through the edges, was pleasure—warm, electric, and wrong. It lit up his brain like a struck match.

The taste was… divine. Better than anything. Rich, savory, layered—like the world’s best steak marinated in human instinct.

He licked the wound, eyes rolling back slightly. It bled freely, and he didn’t even try to stop it.

“What… the fuck,” he muttered.

Then, slowly, deliberately, he brought the finger back to his mouth and bit down again.

Tears streaked his face, but he chewed and swallowed.

His pupils dilated. Something changed. His hands started trembling, but not from fear. From excitement.

An idea formed.

He limped to the kitchen, still high, still shaking. Pulled out a cutting board and a cast iron skillet.

He yanked at his hoodie, tearing the sleeve at the seam. The fabric gave with a rough rip.

Then he rolled up his arm, slow and steady, exposing bare skin.

He picked up the paring knife—small, sharp, familiar—and pressed it to his forearm.

And he carved.

The gash bled like a faucet. Blood ran down his arm, splattered across the floor, smeared on the fridge handle as he moved. He went to the kitchen, rummaged through the spice rack with one shaking hand—pulled rosemary, salt, and a stick of garlic butter from the fridge.

Then he seared a chunk of forearm meat on the skillet. Flipped it like a pro. Medium rare.

The aroma filled the room—rich and savory, thick with garlic butter, rosemary, and salt. The herbs crackled in the skillet, clinging to the seared meat cut from his own forearm. He basted it as it cooked, spooning the sizzling butter over the flesh like he’d done with steak a hundred times before.

Blood still dripped from his elbow as he dug through the fridge, pulling out a half-used onion and a bottle of balsamic glaze from the back shelf. He sliced the onion thin, tossed it into the pan, and let it brown in the leftover fat.

He plated it carefully, almost reverently, with the caramelized onions and a drizzle of the glaze across the top.

He took a bite.

And wept—silent, shaking, the taste overwhelming.


Chapter 5: The Munchies

Danny had turned his kitchen into a chef’s playground.

The floor was slick with blood. The counters were stained with fat and tissue. He stood barefoot, shirtless now, his skin pale and glistening with sweat, chest rising and falling like a beast mid-hunt. He’d wrapped a towel around the worst of the bleeding on his arm, but it soaked through fast.

Every new dish was better than the last.

He’d carved meat from his thighs with the precision of a chef, searing it with a brown sugar rub. It tasted like pork belly kissed by hellfire.

Next he sliced off two of his toes with a kitchen knife—clean, careful cuts, just below the knuckles. Blood pooled around his foot, but he barely noticed. He was focused, methodical.

In the kitchen, he pulled out a bag of jasmine rice from the pantry, a bottle of rice vinegar from the back of a cabinet, and a half-used sheet of nori from the drawer where he kept random dry goods. He rinsed the rice, cooked it just right, and fanned it cool like he’d seen in videos.

He filleted the raw toe meat thin, arranging it over tight rolls with scallions, avocado slices, and a smear of wasabi. A splash of soy sauce on the side.

He ate at the table, cross-legged, using real chopsticks. Still plating like a pro—rolls lined up neatly, everything balanced. Like it mattered.

Blood gushed steadily from what was left of his feet, soaking into the floor beneath him, pooling under his ankles as he calmly chewed.

The high bent time out of shape. The clocks meant nothing. The light outside had shifted, but he hadn’t noticed when. Minutes bled into hours, or maybe it had been a full day—Danny couldn’t tell anymore.

The only thing he knew for sure was that dinner was done.

Now he needed something sweet. Something rich and warm, indulgent enough to drown out the hum still buzzing in his skull.

He needed dessert. 

He shuffled to the pantry, leaving sticky red footprints on the tile—ragged, uneven prints with toes missing, blood smearing where he limped. He grabbed flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and a half-used bag of chocolate chips. From a lower cabinet, he pulled out a muffin tin, a pie dish, and his old set of measuring cups—faded plastic, edges warped from years of heat.

Back at the counter, he took a breath, picked up the knife, and cut off his nose in a single, shaking motion. The cartilage crunched, blood gushed, but he barely flinched. He minced the nose finely and folded it into a rich brownie batter—melted chocolate, brown sugar, eggs, a splash of vanilla extract he found behind the olive oil. He poured the thick, glossy mix into a baking pan and slid it into the oven.

Next were the ears. He sawed them off one at a time, sliced them thin, and tossed them into a saucepan with butter and brown sugar. They simmered until soft, candied and coated in a sticky glaze. He spooned them over a vanilla custard tart he made with heavy cream and egg yolks, whisked together in a glass bowl he hadn’t used in years.

Then came the left eye.

He stood over the sink, breathing hard, and dug it out with the handle of a spoon. His vision blurred, blood ran down his cheek, but he held the slippery orb in his palm like something sacred. He diced it delicately and folded it into a dense almond cake batter—ground almonds from the freezer, sugar, eggs, and a bit of citrus zest he scraped from the last lonely lemon on the counter. He poured it into a ramekin and baked it until golden.

From the fridge, he grabbed the jar of maraschino cherries and drizzled the syrup across the finished desserts—brownie, tart, and almond cake. The final touch: a dusting of powdered sugar and a few curls of dark chocolate shaved from the last bar in the cupboard.

He sat at the table, blood running freely from his face, dripping off his chin and soaking the floor.

The brownies were rich and dense, the nose bits giving them a salty, savory chew. The tart was smooth and sweet, the candied ears melting slightly into the custard. The almond cake was perfect—moist, lightly sweet, with a subtle pop from the eye, like biting into a grape that had secrets.

He took bite after bite, his only eye fluttering shut.

Beautiful. Sweet. Enough.

Then the high began to slip.

It was subtle at first. A flicker of nausea. The whisper of pain getting louder. The smell of blood growing thicker, more metallic. The taste of himself—once divine—started to turn sour.

He looked down.

His legs were mangled. One thigh looked like it had been peeled like fruit. His feet were blue.

The hunger was gone. Replaced by horror.

The room spun, but it wasn’t the weed anymore. It was blood loss. Shock. The screaming pain finally caught up with him, and he started to panic.

He staggered toward the couch, legs trembling beneath him. His knees buckled, and he collapsed onto the floor, the impact jarring through his bones. Gritting his teeth, he clawed at the carpet, dragging himself forward inch by inch, each movement leaving a smear of blood in his wake.

Then—the front door creaked open, its hinges groaning in protest.

A sliver of light pierced the darkness, stretching across the room like a spotlight. The air shifted, carrying with it the scent of the outside world.

He froze, breath hitching, as the door inched wider, the sound of its movement echoing like a warning.


Chapter 6: Sobering Truth

Kyle stepped into the apartment, calling out half-assed.

“Yo, dude? You left the door unlocked—again.”

He kicked off his shoes, the soft thud reverberating in the stillness. A few steps in, his foot landed in something warm and slick. He froze.

Blood. Everywhere.

The stench hit him—a thick, metallic tang that clung to the back of his throat, mingled with the sourness of rot and the acrid scent of burnt flesh. His stomach lurched, the lucky charms cereal from breakfast started rising in his throat. 

He staggered back, hand covering his mouth. His voice trembled as he called out, “…Danny?”

He stepped deeper into the house, each footfall squelching against the sticky floor. The kitchen unfolded before him like a war zone—counters strewn with bloodied utensils, the air thick with the smell of burnt flesh and copper. The stove’s burners hissed, casting an eerie glow over the chaos. Pans overflowed with congealed fat and unidentifiable chunks, their contents seared into the metal.

Instinctively, he lunged forward and twisted the knobs to the off position, silencing the burners. The sudden quiet was deafening, amplifying the grotesque scene before him.

Amidst the carnage, remnants of baking were scattered across the countertops. A mixing bowl smeared with batter sat beside a tray of misshapen cookies, their edges charred. A dusting of flour coated the surfaces, now tinged pink from the blood that had seeped into it. Measuring cups lay overturned, their contents spilled and forgotten.

Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a flicker of movement. He turned his head sharply and saw Danny. 

He lay sprawled on the floor, barely conscious. His face was a mask of blood and bruises, but what made Kyle’s breath catch—was the gaping red wound where his left eye had been. 

“Dude…” Danny croaked, blood bubbling at the corner of his mouth. “I’m… so full.”

As Kyle stared in horror, Danny slowly lifted his mangled hand to his face and began to nibble at the stumps where his fingers had once been. His teeth worked meticulously, lips trembling, as if he were savoring the last bites of a decadent meal.

Kyle screamed, fumbling with his phone. His blood-slick fingers slipped across the screen as he tried to dial 911, the device nearly falling from his grasp.

“I need an ambulance! Now! My friend—he… he’s—oh fuck, he’s EATING HIMSELF!”

The operator tried to talk him through it, but Kyle wasn’t listening. He was pacing, sobbing, trying not to puke. He looked down at the coffee table and saw the bong—Veronica, still packed. Still warm.

“…fuck it,” Kyle muttered. “I need something to calm down.”

He lit it. Took a hit.

The smoke burned down hard.

Kyle exhaled slowly, the last tendrils of smoke curling from his lips. His eyes, half-lidded and glazed, scanned the room lazily.

A low rumble emanated from his stomach, breaking the silence. He blinked, a slow grin spreading across his face.

“Man,” he drawled, patting his belly. “I’m so hungry.”",1,1746287904.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I'm posting here because I feel confused, emotionally raw, and unsure if I'm overreacting or just finally noticing something that’s been hurting me for a while.

For context: I have a history of severe bullying in school and from family members around my body, and I developed a lot of body image issues growing up. But I’ve worked hard in therapy for years and I’m now in a place where I genuinely feel content in my body. I enjoy food, I don't restrict myself, and I don’t obsess over how I look anymore. That peace didn’t come easy — it’s something I really protect.

A while ago I became close friends with a woman who initially seemed warm, supportive, and fun to be around. I noticed early on that she had low self-esteem and was very self-deprecating. As we got closer, I started noticing more and more signs of disordered eating and a really painful relationship with her body. There were subtle red flags — like planning dinner together and her showing up saying she’d already eaten, repeatedly. She'd describe herself as ""fat"" or ""ugly"", and often say she didn’t understand why her partner was with her because she’s “not a good catch.”

Over time, she started talking more openly about periods of starvation, binging, only eating a chocolate bar for a day, and so on. I gently asked if she was seeing a therapist and encouraged her to consider talking to a professional about these things.

A few weeks ago, we went for brunch and she said something that honestly shocked me: “My husband’s parents are coming to town — I need to lose weight.” I asked if someone had said something hurtful to her. She said no, that it was all coming from her own anxiety.

Then she looked at me and said: *“Aren’t you bullied for how much you weigh?”*  
I was stunned and asked what she meant. She said, *“Well, you’re not skinny. Don’t people bully you?”*

Today we met up again and she started opening up more directly about her eating disorder — starving for days, collapsing, feeling out of control. I tried to hold space and encouraged her to work through it in therapy. She then asked, “How aren’t you struggling with these thoughts?”  
I told her honestly: “I used to, but I’ve worked hard in therapy. I love food and I don’t look at my body that way anymore.”

As the day went on, she kept commenting on other women’s bodies — “too skinny, too muscular, too fat.” It was exhausting to be around. At one point, I said (lightly), “You look very wintery — why the coat in this heat?”  
She got tense and said, “I need to cover myself up. But I’ll take it off.”  
I reassured her I didn’t mean it judgmentally and she should wear whatever makes her feel safe.

Later, we had coffee and I ordered cake. She didn’t want any at first, but then took a bite — going straight for the middle. I smiled and joked, “Going for the best part!” I was laughing and gently teasing her.  
She dropped the fork, snapped, and said, *“You should just fuck off.”*  I said ""Oh no no please have it I am just teasing you.""

At first, I thought she was joking too — then I realized she wasn’t. I apologised over and over, saying I didn’t mean to make her feel bad, that she could have as much as she liked. She shut down and looked like she was about to cry. I tried to talk about it gently, but she didn’t want to. We moved on to another topic, but the energy had changed.

Then I made a casual comment about how gyms make me anxious because I don’t know how to use the equipment. She said in a sarcastic tone, *“It’s not that hard.”*  
I said, “I used to be really sporty,” and she responded: *“Now you’re a lazy cat.”*

I felt stunned. I know these comments come from her pain, but they’re starting to feel really mean and unsafe. I’m starting to walk on eggshells. I’ve done my best to be supportive, kind, and gentle, but I’m beginning to feel like I’m being pulled back into a toxic place — one where I’m made to feel ashamed of my body, or guilty for having a healthier relationship with food.

I don’t want to abandon someone in pain. I also know what it’s like to be in the depths of shame. But at what point does compassion for a friend become self-abandonment?

Has anyone experienced something similar — a friendship that began warmly but became emotionally unsafe due to someone else’s trauma or disorder? How do you set boundaries in a situation like this without feeling like the “bad guy”?

# The Red Codex

Third edition 40K arrived in 1998 and, much like second, started off with a get-you-by army list inheriting the principles of its predecessor. One List To Rule Them All, every Chaos army built the same, and this time there were no allies – no Cultists, no Beastmen, and no random WFB Chaos Warriors or Trolls tacked onto the side because they’d been there in a book published ten years earlier when everything was a lot more... woolly. Andy Chambers was now the Overfiend, the lead developer for Warhammer 40,000 and his vision of Chaos Space Marines – a raiding force of Chaos Space Marines supplemented by summoned Daemons – was definitive of Chaos as a whole. Night Lords remained as the visual focus for Chaos Space Marines throughout this period – it’s the same Studio army from before that appears in the core rulebook, the 3.0 Codex, and also Codex Cityfight.

Cityfight is where we really see the Night Lords shine for the first time, with the rules for urban combat showcased through the campaign, the story, and the battle report concerning their raid on the planet Vogen. Brutal, vicious, and delighting in making the defenders *suffer* even as they retreat, these are the Night Lords as they’d be for the decades to come. Codex Cityfight also featured a Night Lords Chaos Lord with twin lightning claws and a jump pack, and he looked *boss as*. You could make a troop type out of this!

It came out shortly after our 3.0 Codex - that is to say, our first Codex for third editions. The edition cycle was longer and slower in those days, there were fewer armies in the game, and in *this* case, having just reset the entire game system, GW focused on getting the rules out quickly in a series of 48 page Codex books and 24 page supplements.

There's no faffing about with 3.0: you get your army list, tactics section, painting guide, and some in-universe documents from which you’re meant to derive how the setting works, rather than being told directly in the rather heavy-handed style of the previous editions. Personally, I like this style: it assumes the reader is literate, intelligent, and able to read between the lines, grasping that all narrators are unreliable and the galaxy is a big place where nothing is entirely definitive or certain. I also know I'm in the minority: most old heads seem to hate these. Still, it's an important milestone for the VIII Legion.

3.0 introduced a couple of new troop types, the Raptor and Obliterator squads. To reflect the Chaos Space Marines’ logistical difficulties in their long exile, you could only include one of each unit in your army: it’s hard to keep jump packs running when you don’t have proper Techmarines any more, and nobody knows what the hell’s up with the Obliterators - or why their first iteration was so… square. Nice idea, but terrible potato faced models. These were at the time just units any Chaos Space Marine army could use, under the “one list to rule them all” approach, but that approach was about to be… overruled.

# Index Astartes

During this period, GW was taking 40K a lot more seriously than it had before. Rogue Trader, the first edition, had been quite a whimsical game that nobody expected to sell as well as it did – the second edition had been a pillar of GW’s growth in the early 1990s but hadn’t quite overtaken WFB to the extent that it would – and third was, for reasons outside the purview of this discussion, going to make or break the company after that bubble had unceremoniously burst shortly before it launched. (If you’re interested, Goonhammer did a *wonderful* bit of proper games journalism about this period: look up their Gorkamorka two-parter, which is also a great checkpoint for the late 1990s and early 2000s period of GW’s company history as a whole.)

Some aspects of the background had always been developed in more detail than others, like Space Marines’ biological implants and Chapter organisation, or the *reams* of material on Orks (seriously, there’s a whole coffee table book of *just fluff* for them: nobody else got that kind of treatment), but it seems to have come out of what individual developers thought was cool. Now there was an effort to flesh out and define a lot more, and *especially* anything in power armour, because it had become clear that Space Marines were where the money was. It was time for GW to turn back to that rather sketchy “Horus Heresy” idea, which they’d added keynote details to during development of the Codex Army Books in second edition, and *really* go to town.

The avenue for this development? White Dwarf. Before the domestic Internet really took off, before you could be ""into Warhammer"" and still six handshakes away from a GW publication, the company rag was a *huge* deal. At its worst, White Dwarf was a catalogue – sales hype for the new models and mail order codes for the parts, punctuated by reheated bits from the army books. That was the slump of the early 1990s, and the deflated fart of the 2010s. At its best, under successive editors Jake Thornton, the late Paul Sawyer, and Guy Haley, White Dwarf was a creative powerhouse. Every month brought you new rules, new units, whole new armies in their beta-test “play this and tell us how it works” stage, DIY campaign and modelling tips, and at least one battle report. CSM had their due during this period: Chaos Cultists returned to the fray (because a junior designer had made some cool ones as a short run of metal miniatures) while Daemon Princes got some proper character upgrades to extend their rather anemic entry in the Codex.

White Dwarf also brought us the Index series: articles that took one aspect of the background and went hard, fleshing it out in the direct-to-reader explanatory style that had been popular in second edition and giving it a variant army list, or a new squad type or wargear items, or whatever it took to differentiate this cool thing from the “vanilla” version in the Codex. One such series, Index Astartes, went through all the keynote Space Marine Chapters – including all eighteen of the extant First Founding Legions, as well as the Blood Ravens from the Dawn of War series, the Legion of the Damned, and anything the developers had made up lately and thought was cool. And of course, the Night Lords got their turn, in August 2001, UK issue 260.

The Index article starts by covering the same key beats as the original Codex Chaos writeup – it just does so at greater length, in more atmospheric (some might say ""flabby and purple"") prose, and including quotations from in-universe documents. What had been half a page in the last go round now took up seven sides (discounting the illustration of Legion troops pre- and post-Heresy, and the sidebar covering an example of the Night Lords at war). 

This isn’t to say that there’s nothing new here, though: this article introduces the theme of divination and foreshadowing, the Primarch’s awareness that the child Conrad Kurze is not the adult Night Haunter, and Kurze’s isolation from his fellow Primarchs, with the exception of Fulgrim, who still inadvertently sells Konrad out after he confesses to the details of his visions. Night Haunter’s attempt on Rogal Dorn’s life, his subsequent imprisonment and escape, and the destruction of Nostramo in the aftermath are all present and correct. Tsagualsa is named for the first time, as well. It’s also made explicitly clear that Night Haunter was “susceptible to the whispered temptations of Chaos” and “dangerously unhinged” from this point on, with some… results.

>No longer did Night Haunter crusade in the name of the Emperor, who he denounced as a weak-willed hypocrite without the courage to admit that his own doctrines were just as extreme. Now the Primarch fought in the name of death and fear, knowing full well how the horrific arsenal at his disposal could aid him in his malign work. Night Haunter changed physically during this time, his lips receding completely, his muscular frame hunching over, and his gnarled hands stretching into grasping talons.

Observe, here, the *indirect* corruption of Chaos as a force of moral and spiritual entropy. Without ever making a direct declaration for the Powers, Night Haunter has come to wear his sins on the outside, as it were. As we go on to look at the final two pages of the article, I find myself asking about the Mark of Chaos Undivided. In the prior editions of 40K, the Marks of Chaos were explicit signs of a pact between champion and god – in Rogue Trader they were literally the first thing a Champion gained to differentiate themselves from a normal member of their species. At the time, I couldn’t make sense out of the Mark of Chaos Undivided – how do you make a pact with an undifferentiated force of corruption? Now I get it. The Mark of Chaos Undivided is like radiation sickness of the soul. Exposure to the Warp draws out the worst aspects of the psyche and makes them physical. Its game mechanical effect, rerolling Morale tests (like Battleshock, but you had to Fall Back if you failed) reflects this, in a way: the Marked are dehumanised and desensitised but not fanatically Fearless.

Anyway. The combat doctrine section is short, identifying the Night Lords’ tendency to prey on the weak in merciless terror campaigns, and also introducing the stealth element, with the Legion described as “masters of infiltration” for the first time. It’s stressed at multiple points that the Night Lords do not fight fair, and lining up in an evenly matched could-go-either-way battle isn’t really their style (despite that being how the overwhelming majority of games were and are played). We also have more words on the Chaos question, from the Beliefs and Gene-Seed sections, which I’ll paraphrase once again.

>Night Lords are exceptionally versatile in their use of the forces of Chaos, employing the hell-spawned powers of each of the major Chaos deities with equal favour. It is just as likely that the Night Lords will be seen fighting alongside a group of foul Plague Marines as it is the warriors of the Thousand Sons. However, it has been ascertained that the Night Lords have nothing but scorn for faith in all its forms, whether it be the fanatical bloodlust of the Khorne Berzerker or the devotion of the Imperial creed. The only authority they recognise is that of temporal power and material wealth.

>\[…\]

>The gene-seed of the Night Lords seems to be surprisingly pure. In fact, of all the Chaos Space Marine Legions, the Night Lords seem to bear the least evidence of mutation. This is perhaps due to a stable gene-seed stock, perhaps due to the fact that they rarely associate themselves with any particular Chaos power for any length of time.

>Although the Night Lords are distinguished by pale skin and jet-black hair, the real legacy of Night Haunter may be psychological. There is a tendency for paranoia and self-destructive behaviour among the Night Lords, and it is said that their sorcerers have a pronounced vulnerability to being wracked with painful seizures in which they experience visions, oblique or not, of the future. Night Haunter is believed to have only been able to see the darkest path of all possible futures, a terrible curse, and the prophecies tended to be self-fulfilling.

The last page of the article is given over to our first ever army list. Marks are limited to Chaos Undivided only, and no Cult units or Daemons (except up to one Daemon Prince) are permitted. 

(If you’re looking at this, and then back to the claim from the previous page that “Night Lords are exceptionally versatile in their use of the forces of Chaos, employing the hell-spawned powers of each of the major Chaos deities with equal favour,” and wondering what the hell happened: so am I. These days we call it ludonarrative dissonance, the phenomenon when the mechanical processes of the game don’t align with the fictional reality being simulated. In short, fluff ain’t rules.)

To make up for these deficits, Night Lords armies could give up the capacity for heavy units (think Land Raiders, Havocs, Obliterators) and go hard on fast units – which meant Bikers and Raptors. Given that the 3.0 Codex restricted players to one unit of Raptors, the Night Lords list also lifts *that* restriction – and this, more than anything else, is the origin of the “Raptor legion” gimmick/meme/beat. The whole thing about Night Lords being the first Legion to field massed jump pack troops? That’s not here, not yet.

This suite of special rules applying to all troops in the army works really well. Third, fourth and fifth edition had quite punishing rules for fighting at Night, which Night Lords could both enforce on the battlefield and mitigate for themselves. There are rules for bypassing enemy sentries in missions that use them, turning off wargear like auspexes and commlinks if the opponent has them, and even interfering with when enemy Reserves arrive. All Chaos Space Marine Veterans could infiltrate back then, and ours could do it better than anyone’s. Our characters gained more benefits from hugging cover, and uniquely among the Traitor Legions, they could also take jump packs.

It’s *good*. It’s *fun*. It doesn’t quite line up with what the background material’s saying, and it’s a step down if you happened to like more Chaos in your Chaos Space Marine army, but it’s a really characterful list in its own right, and it interacts with both the boring “everyone plays these” standard missions and the more complex battle, sabotage and breakthrough categories. The breadth of small things our rules did meant there was always *some* advantage to playing Night Lords, and if conditions were right – if you were the attacker, and the enemy had reserves, and you were playing a Sabotage mission with sentries – the Night Lords were *strong*. Which is exactly what the article said they should be, so I suppose I’ll forgive not being able to splash in a Plague Marine squad.

# The Black Codex

Aspects of this army list would be carried forward into the next Codex: Chaos Space Marines, released in 2002. The 3.5 Codex. The Black Codex. The gold standard against which all others must forevermore be judged.

I don’t like it.

Before I stain my hands, let me explain. At *unit* level, when you’re building squads and characters and vehicles for your army, 3.5 is brilliant. Never before or since have we had such a range of options. Four Undivided daemon weapons! Daemonic Gifts that fundamentally alter the profile of the model they’re applied to! Veteran Skills that shift our units’ capabilities and make them *finally* feel like the ancient warriors they’re supposed to be, able to match the specialisms of any two loyalist Chapters you care to name!

At army level, though, it’s a downgrade. All those cool scenario level rules that turned off or interfered with the enemy’s leadership and scanning and communications and patrols, and let us choose to attack at night when we were strong and the opponent was weak? Gone. Erased. All that’s left is “more Raptors” and “I guess your entire army can be better at lurking in cover.” At least we still get free night vision, and there’s an Undivided Daemon unit we can summon. Even so, I think it's a less flavourful and less interesting and less broad version of the Night Lords than what we'd just had in White Dwarf the year before.

Nevertheless, those heavily customisable squads of Chaos Space Marines have their appeal. Take a quick peek at [my kitbashed Chaos Space Marines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightLords/comments/r3k5bh/four_years_from_acquisition_four_months_between/) – this is the period those models were designed for, and in the early 2000s, GW actively encouraged you to go wild with heavily modular kits that were cut up with part swapping in mind. This was a good thing for me, because (get that red paint ready again) – I don’t like [the Night Lords models from this period](https://www.dakkadakka.com/gallery/1024900-Night%20Lords%20Chaos%20Lord.html) at all.

In 2002 we received our first dedicated “these are Night Lords, it says so on the box” models. Two sprues of plastic Chaos Space Marines, metal shoulderpads and a sword for the leader and… those helmets. The idiot wingaling helmets. The metal Night Lords Hero also had them. These wings were… huge, and chunky, and sticking them on the *stealthy* Chaos Space Marine Legion felt like [a bad joke](https://www.moddb.com/groups/warhammer-40k-fans-group/images/night-lords-masters-of-stealth).

It was a damn good time to play Chaos Space Marines in general, though. Iron Warriors were powerful as hell, my Word Bearers were riding high summoning the seriously stacked Bloodletters all over the shop, and if you were into your Traitors and Mutants, the brilliant Lost and Damned army list from 2003 would see you right. It *was* a golden age, personal taste notwithstanding. Certainly a lot better than what came next.

# The Abominable Gavdex

In 2007, the Chaos Space Marines received their Codex for fourth edition, and it wasn’t good. Internal balance was terrible, with the Plague Marines standing out as must-takes for a variety of reasons, a *busted good* Slaanesh psychic power available to both your characters, and regular Chaos Space Marines – that unit which had access to so many wargear options, veteran skills, and extensively customisable champions who were on the path to glory in their own right – well, they got to have a boltgun *and* a bolt pistol *and* a chainsword in this edition. And that’s it. Even their Marks of Chaos were attached to an Icon, and went away if the model with the Icon was removed. The daemonic units were gone for everyone, replaced with generic “Summoned Greater Daemon” and “Summoned Lesser Daemons” profiles. Absolutely no Legions had any special rules at all. The Night Lords, in this period, were just a colour scheme, with about a sentence of description.

We were stuck with this for the next five years. Chaos Space Marine players who wanted to enjoy their games, let alone try to *win* them, struggled along with the one build that worked for a while, but by fifth edition, the way to play Chaos Space Marines was to show up with Codex Space Wolves. Or Codex Blood Angels. Or Codex Grey Knights. Because the real kick in the nuts here was that the extremely stripped-down no-special-rules approach taken to Chaos Space Marines lasted for all of two books, and the external balance, the customisation, the range of things you could *do* with the army, were all casualties of that shift in philosophy.

A friend of mine had the chance to sit down for a pint with Gav Thorpe, whose name is on this atrocity, and ask him what the hell was going on. Apparently the plan was to split Daemons off into their own army, and then to release a wave of Codex books for specific Traitor Legions like the loyalists had. Someone in a decision making capacity got cold feet, and the Chaos Space Marines were left as this misshapen glimpse into a simpler world that wasn’t the one inhabited by anyone else except the Dark Angels.

We’d get ours, though, going into sixth edition – and so would they. Join me next time for Heldrakes, Traitor Legions, and the words “Forge The Narrative” losing all meaning. Unless I decide to do the Black Library books instead. Let me know what you'd like, unless you're still mad at me about 3.5.

Context: I work remotely and am looking for a new place to live. 
I am NOT an urban person, so I am looking for a surrounding town of  one of the above cities, or one you suggest. 


I'd like to rent a furnished place for a few months, ideally a small SFH or a townhouse for under $~3400 /mo. (For something longer term I would pay less but there's obviously a premium for the convenience of a furnished shorter term stay.)

Info about me: late 30s F, works in tech, have a dog. I like golfing, but don't care about fancy courses- just want to be able to have lots of options and reasonably affordable. (let's say under $40 for 9 holes at an off-peak time). 

What I want:

-The outskirts or nearby town of a proper city that has enough going on. I should be able to find other people to socialize with, within a 25 min drive or so.  Ithaca NY would be too small, for example. 

-I enjoy being around smart cultured people in the greater metro area. Would be nice to have one or two coworking spaces to go a  couple times a week.

-Lots of green space is a must -lush dense greenery (so nothing in the mountain time zone). 

-I like being able to access other cities within a few hours drive too. 
Cinci- Lexington, Louisville, Columbus nearby

-Providence- Boston and all of new England is reasonably accessible 

-Albany- Not too terrible to take a train to NYC; boston and ADKs within a few hours.

-I had considered Buffalo for proximity to Toronto, but don't want to chance it with all of our borders potentially getting closed (although unlikely)

-Local business/coffee culture is a strong bonus. I like to support local businesses whenever possible.


What I DONT want: 

-Extreme weather ( Sun, heat, gray, constant rain). I don't mind snow as long as you get breaks from it, but Minnesota is way too cold. Richmond VA is too hot for me.

-To be surrounded by a vocal majority of conservative Christians

-A predominantly provincial mentality where the most residents have lived in that same place their whole life, are baffled by the thought of international travel. (Pittsburgh metro outside of the CMU area)

-Inconsiderate people (litter, blasting loud music, aftermarket exhaust mods, leaving dog crap on yards/sidewalks). Yes they exist everywhere but are easier to avoid in certain places!

This modular stroller system, boasting a reversible frame and paired with the LiteMax Infant Car Seat, offers a combination of versatility and thoughtful design that makes parenting easier—or at least more manageable! However, like any product, it’s got its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the design impressed me. Promenade Blue isn’t just a name; the shade is vibrant yet understated, making it suitable for parents seeking something classic without being boring. The blend of polyester and mesh materials feels durable yet soft, which is a balance you’d hope for in a baby product. Its metal frame adds a sense of sturdiness without making the stroller overly heavy. At 24.9 pounds, carrying it around isn’t a workout, though I’d advise testing its portability if stairs are part of your daily routine.

This travel system doesn't skimp on thoughtful touches, like the oversized storage basket that easily carried my diaper bag, groceries, and even my coffee cup snugly in the flex-hold cup holder. The LATCH-compatible car seat setup is seamless for switching between car and stroller—so seamless, in fact, that even during my sleep-deprived mornings, I didn't mess it up!  

**Advantages**  
- The six usage modes, including toddler, carriage, and car seat setups, offer flexibility as your child grows.  
- The mesh privacy shade was an unexpected favorite. Whether out for a walk or at a bustling park, its ability to provide quiet moments for the baby or block out distractions was a game-changer.  
- Maneuverability stood out—its rear-wheel suspension and large cruiser tires handled curbs and uneven sidewalks like a champ.  

[Check Evenflo 54712427 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b09x229ywb/)

**Performance and Practicality**  
Performance matters, and this product doesn’t disappoint—mostly. From handling quick stops at the store to extended days at the zoo, the stroller provides a smooth ride for both baby and parent. You can feel the quality in the front-wheel swivel system, which makes maneuvering effortless, even in cramped spaces. Brakes are sturdy and flip-flop-friendly, a nice bonus during warmer months when I dare to wear sandals.  

The reversible frame lets your child face you or out toward the world in the various modes, adding that extra layer of convenience. Switching from carriage mode to toddler mode takes seconds, though I did feel that the system could be slightly less finicky when trying to click parts into place—especially when wrangling an impatient child in one arm.

**Negatives**  
- Folding the stroller, while generally straightforward, feels bulkier than I expected when trying to lift it into my car trunk.  
- The included cup holder is perfect for water bottles or baby bottles but doesn't fit larger or oddly shaped travel mugs.  
- Although the car seat is comfortable for infants up to 35 pounds, I wonder how long children on the higher end of the growth curve will truly enjoy it.  

**Good Points**  
- Oversized windows in both the stroller and car seat canopies give parents a clear view without disturbing the baby.  
- Offers compatibility with Evenflo’s Rider Board, perfect if you’ve got a toddler who wants the occasional free ride!  

**Challengers**  
For those considering an alternative to this travel system, brands like Graco Modes and Chicco Bravo offer similar options. While the Graco often has a slightly higher price tag, it features one-step folding mechanisms that might appeal to parents tired of wrestling strollers into their vehicles. The Chicco stands out for its cushier padding in both the stroller and car seat but lacks the 6-in-1 modular versatility that Evenflo offers. Personally, I found the privacy shade and the reversible frame to be distinguishing factors that gave Evenflo an edge, though Chicco’s smoother car seat adjustments might appeal to those prioritizing ease of installation.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of financial value, the Evenflo Pivot Vizor Travel System sits at a sweet spot. It’s not a bargain bin option, nor does it carry an excessive price tag. You’re paying for versatility, reliability, and thoughtful extras like the privacy shade, which other systems lack. Parents gravitating toward higher-end products will find this system meeting their needs without breaking the bank, especially given its long usability from infant stages to toddler years.

1kdvskj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cirrhosis/comments/1kdvskj/what_should_i_expect/,What should I expect?,"Hello. I do not have cirrhosis but my mother does. 

My 67 year old mother has been diagnosed with liver cancer twice now. The first time we beat it, yay. This second time around; it’s been 8 months of disappointment.

Back in October they did a scan just to make sure she was still in remission. However after reading her scans, they discovered the cancer is back and larger. And the cirrhosis is bad but not terrible. At that time, we scheduled a Y90 procedure a few days before Christmas. Dr said if we didn’t treat it, she’d be gone by next Christmas. Between October and Christmas, mom started losing weight rapidly and would have occasional falls. Still able to walk with her walker, still eats something once a day, still spunky but a little confused about whether she put salt in her food or not (example of confusion).

December rolls around and has the procedure done. But now she’s confused about what I said to her last week, goes outside for a cigarette maybe 3x a day now, maybe eats toast but has 3-4 cups of coffee a day. Falling about every other week. 

I give birth to my baby early, baby goes to NICU, I’m still hospitalized due to complications, I don’t see my mom for 3 weeks. When I do see her, she’s sick. Falls, nearly falls, a couple times a week. Complains of pain in her liver. Confused about what I said to her an hour ago. Gained a lot of weight rapidly. Legs extremely swollen. I decide since I’m on maternity leave, I’ll make her an appt and take her to see her primary care physician. So I do that. They tell me to take her to the hospital because she needs to be admitted. 

She has pneumonia, the excess fluid build up is not concerning to them nor was the rapid weight gain. Her falling and the pneumonia is what concerned them. They get physically therapy involved to help reteach her to do her own daily tasks herself, as she now can barely put her socks on. She’s hospitalized for a week, sent home to a skilled nursing facility, there for a few weeks, gets sent home. She is home 3-4 days before she falls again. And this cycle repeats. 

Until the Monday after Easter. She came home that Friday and I had been helping her take a shower that morning. But she fell as I was helping her get out of the shower. Call the paramedics, they come and take her to the hospital. They do full body scans. Send her to the skilled nursing facility again. She has pressure sores. Can’t walk, so they use a lift. Very confused. Doesn’t know the day or year. I’m lucky if she eats a few bites of food a day. The swelling is enormous in her belly. 

Then this week we hear 2 things. The first, coming from the doctor that oversees the nursing facility, said we need to consider hospice sooner or later. The next day, her oncologist said the cancer is stable but it’s the cirrosis that is concerning and life limiting, his exact words. And the soonest they can see her to rescan her and see what they can do for her to make her comfortable, isn’t until the 15th.

My family and I have come to the conclusion that this is the end of life for mom. She has many symptoms of end stage liver disease, all but the jaundice actually. I just want to know what to expect when I go in on the 15th with her. It’s crazy how fast she is declining. Last week I could hold somewhat a conversation but this week, we’ll start off by talking about what’s for dinner and she’ll drift the conversation to what my dad was wearing then forget we were even talking. She doesn’t eat, I try taking her snacks she used to love. She gets excited about them but takes 1 bite and is done. She’s so bruised from the safety button wristlet that I had them change arms. She’s always nauseas, extreme swelling in the legs. They said she has about 10lbs of swelling frm the ascites. When I look in her eyes, I feel like she’s not even there. Just last night she told me that she heard someone calling her name from the hallway. No one was calling her name. She even asked the nurse who here knows her. No one but her visitors. And all her visitors were in the room at that time. I know she’s dying. I can see it before my eyes. But what comes next? Do I have long? It’s cruel how this disease has taken her. I don’t recognize her and that scares me. ",1,1746286683.0,Cirrhosis,0,1.0,False
1kdvsd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1kdvsd0/why_is_working_at_a_caferestaurant_as_a_student/,Why is working at a cafe/restaurant as a student still lowkey “weird” in India?,"Okay, so I’ve been thinking — why is it that in India, students working part-time jobs in cafes or restaurants is still not a thing?

In the West, it’s super normal. You’re 18, working at Starbucks or McDonald’s, earning your own cash, paying for your own stuff — no big deal. But here? The moment you say “I wanna work part-time at a cafe,” people act like you failed in life.

I’m a student myself, and honestly, I would love to work part-time. Not to make lakhs — just enough to buy my own coffee, pay my bills, maybe stop asking my parents for every little thing.

But the reality:

Most places don’t offer part-time or hourly roles.

You either go full-time (which is not possible for students) or nothing.

There’s already a huge crowd looking for full-time jobs, so we’re not even considered.

And of course — the desi judgment: “Beta, concentrate on your studies. These jobs are not for you.” Like bro, I’m studying, but I also wanna earn a bit, what’s the problem?


Also, let’s talk about the big players — McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Domino’s, Starbucks — these brands give student jobs abroad all the time. Why not in India? They’re literally perfect for part-time shifts. Students could easily work 4 hours a day or weekends, learn customer service, earn some money, and still go to college.

It’s 2025, and student side-hustles shouldn’t just be limited to content creation or internships. Let us take orders, make lattes, clean tables — and normalize it.

I was reading this article about this chef and how she achieves an ideal lifestyle.

This is kinda the vibe I got.

“I wake up at 4am, do some hardcore yoga, green smoothie for breakfast, a slice of toast with Whole Foods (bc its gotta be Whole Foods) oven roasted turkey and avocado spread for lunch, i’ve always lived an active lifestyle, my fave snack are these fresh baked chips, eat all your veggies!! cook at home!!”

Okay, so chances are, if you’ve ever spent 5 min anywhere on the internet, you’ve seen people with this lifestyle.

You see the aesthetic videos and reels with “oh here’s my perfect little latte with the white swirl like a heart” and “im having this super fancy sushi dish with blah blah blah” and “look at me showing my nice shoes as i take a brisk stroll to the bookstore.”

Okay, so you know what I'm talking about.

Let me preface my question with this:

I am NOT shitting on anyone who actually lives this life. I know social media is 99.9% fake trash, but I also know there ARE people who live like this--and that’s totally cool! Personally, I have in my entire life only known 1 person that actually lived this kind of lifestyle through and through and that was back in the early 2000s and it only lasted from the time she got into college till the time she got married, so roughly 6 years. (She said with the many up and downs of life, it just wasn’t sustainable/was very hard to maintain that lifestyle for her personally.)

I just want to be crystal clear that I don’t hate on people for living healthy active lives. I used to be one of these people! Wake up early, drive to them gym for a workout before having a healthy breakfast, going to work, coming home, working out another hour, cook a healthy dinner... It didn't last because I found it also really hard to maintain this lifestyle with the ups and downs of life, job changing, what grocery stores are available, apartment gyms being scary when you have social anxiety--whatever, you get the idea.

Let me stress this one more time (bc I feel like people are already eager to start going “omg you just hate people that live healthy, active lives!”)

ACTUALLY, this post wasn’t meant for those people at all.

Here’s my point (and follow up question):

Every person’s version of “normal” differs, right? I mean, normal to one family in one state or one country or one time period or one culture... it’s all relative. That’s totally cool.

So, for me... my “normal” is kind of everyone else’s “normal” that I know. I live in a small town. We all sleep in on weekends, wake up early for work, run through drive thru for breakfast or just throw some coffee in a thermos. We’re tired at work. We have good days, we have bad days. It’s not a wealthy town, so you don’t really see people shopping here for expensive, super healthy foods. It’s kinda just farmers markets, Walmart, Target... Again, stuff people (and again I stress this) WHO LIVE HERE that I KNOW ON SOME LEVEL consider “normal.”

I know tons of people in my town and I don't know anyone that lives that social media lifestyle. Not saying there AREN'T people who live like that. Again, totally cool if they do. But I don’t know them.

So I say ALL THIS to ask:

If you were the one making IG and TikTok reels... instead of pretty mugs of “cozy tea”...

would yours just have like a can of Diet Coke? lol

Instead of photos of exotic foods at these restaurants you seem to go to on a daily basis...

would yours just be like “hey, we made spaghetti tonight!”

Instead of ""look at me shopping for books and art,""

would yours just be ""I'm gonna take a nap"" 

Are you waking up at 4am and doing yoga straight outta bed?

... or are you waking up and sitting there contemplating your life choices before rolling out of bed because it’s probably gonna be a pretty long day?

It's not to say you don't enjoy cozy tea, exotic foods, shopping for books and art, and waking up at 4am to do yoga.... but that's usually the stuff on social media that's the really viral stuff, not the Diet Coke, boxed spaghetti, etc...

So anyway, I dunno, that’s my version of “normal.” lol Any other “normal” people like that out there like this? Or maybe to someone that totally disagrees, doesn't find this normal at all, and in fact finds it ""abnormal...""

In which case... any other “abnormal” people out there? lol

Just wondering if me and the people I’ve known in my life so far are the only ones who don’t live that social media lifestyle that people seem to crave and admire. Like I know that a lot of people realistically don't live that way... but sometimes I need to ask and be reminded because man... social media really does fight to set the standard for what our lives should be, doesn't it?

1kdvs15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learndutch/comments/1kdvs15/how_to_assess_your_language_level/,How to assess your language level?,"I'm a bit frustrated at this point. Here is why.

*TL;DR*
I don't trust placement test results because they seem to be too good, I've always did well on tests, but I'm bad at speaking. As I'm about to enroll in a proper course, I'd like to get a reliable assessment of my language level.

I tried learning Dutch at least 3 times over the past 10 years. Yeah, I suck at learning languages. I lived in NL for like 6 years, but since I was working at a university I never needed any Dutch, English was the official language for communicating. Anyhow, after 3 years of living in my home country (I hate it here, everything is fucked) and retraining into IT, I want to move back to NL and find work in a tech company as a frontend software engineer. Most of the job offers, if not all, require fluent Dutch. So now I have a very solid reason to finally learn this language for good, as I plan to stay there, get mortgage and get old with a good healthcare system.

I did an A1 course from Talencentrum at RUG when I stayed there, so about 4 years ago.

About a month or two ago I decided it's time to get back and study Dutch. I started with a free online MOOC given by RUG, it's at A0 level. It was easy, I got everything. Then I checked my level using [this tool](https://talencentrum.webhosting.rug.nl/node/11) and got A1/A2.

 I'm using Busuu daily (45 days streak), I'm halfway through the A1-A2 course. Things do make sense and since I used to speak German at B2 level (though it was 10 years ago), lot's of grammar makes sense and is somewhat familiar. I started using ""Nederlands in gang"", currently on lesson 5. I also listen to a Dutch podcast ""Zeg het in Nederlands"". I also finished a [simple course on Udemy, 14 hours.](https://www.udemy.com/course/dutch-for-beginners/?srsltid=AfmBOopH5s_jlU5QPZuBYuKBtq7FqjfMT_6e-Vnm9Uxmp37xsyHw0o5Z) I understand a lot from both reading and listening, but when I try to produce the language, I feel lost and frustrated that I don't know enough words. Anyhow, yesterday I checked my level again using the same tool from RUG. I got B1/B2. But that's impossible, to get to this level so quickly and while not really being able to speak more than a few simple sentences. So I took a placement test in one of the language schools from my home country that offers Dutch - https://nederlandinstituut.pl/kursy-jezyka-niderlandzkiego/test-kwalifikacyjny/ - and I got 63/100. That's roughly equivalent to B1. Which is impossible, I think, even though I know I can learn things very quickly, but if I can't produce language well enough to make a sentence that's not about my name, where I come from or ordering a coffee in het caffé, then something isn't right in this level assessment. And I'm notoriously good at passing tests, as a previous academic. And I think my muscle memory from knowing German all those years ago is screwing the results.

Do you know of any other reliable ways of assessing your level? I'm about to enroll in an online course for A1/A2, because I think I'm not on A2 level yet, but those two placement tests I did suggest it will be too easy for me. But the A2/B1 course is already inschrijving gesloten. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but 320€ was cheap when I was earning in €, now when I'm earning in PLN it's fairly expensive. And I don't want to wait for the next cohort, I'm too impatient and I need to get some speaking practice. (I could speak with my Dutch friend, but when I tried he was using too advanced language and I either understood very little or didn't know how to respond. Talking with another learner at similar level and having a teacher would be much better).
I looked into other options, and Talencentrum Leiden doesn't offer online course in Dutch, UvA Talen is even more expensive but at least they offer way more courses (in terms of schedule). €450 for A1-A2, €655 for any level above A2. That's a lot. Would be good to know what's my level before I spend money...

Being each other's reason to smile while texting, silly jokes, bantering and laughing together, being affectionate and having sometimes super absurd and sometimes deep almost philosophical conversations about anything and nothing. But also things like going on road trips and other fun adventures.

I am 27 years old and live in Germany. I have brown hair, blue grey eyes, wear glasses and I am 1.83 meters. I tend to be kind of introverted, but that changes once I warm up and feel comfortable. A sense of humour is important to me as I like to make people laugh. Making terrible jokes is one of my biggest skills.

I am looking for a monogamous relationship. Long distance is fine for a while as long as it's possible to visit each other sometimes and close the distance eventually. I also think the distance and time difference shouldn’t be too great. However, I can also imagine to relocate at some point.
I don't have a specific preference who I am looking for or an age range, but I've noticed I generally get along best with people between 23 and 40.
Just be nice and interesting and able to hold a conversation so that we can share things, talk about our days and what's on our mind.

A little bit more about me:

* Travelling is my biggest passion and I want to see as many places as possible. Thinking about new experiences, landscapes I've never seen before and all the different kinds of food in the world always puts a smile on my face. Solotravelling is great, but maybe it's even better with a partner? I always appreciate recommendations for unusual or underrated destinations.
* I live alone in a small apartment in a big city and work an office job that I like.
* Books are awesome and I enjoy sitting in the sun with an exciting book and cup of coffee on a calm day.
* I like playing video games. Unfortunately I suck at most of them, especially the competitive ones. Currently I mainly play Anno 1800, Satisfactory, Kingdom come deliverance or Stardew Valley.
* Good food is my weakness and I enjoy cooking and baking bread, but I am not good at it and too lazy most of the time. Therefore I also like to try out new food places.
* I am also trying to do more sport, but getting motivated is hard. I like running, riding a bike and swimming and also like to try new activities.
* Languages, history and geography are some of my biggest interests.
* I like to be active and spontaneous just as much as being a homebody.
* Politically, I consider myself a bit left. I'm not a fan of conservative and definitely against anything further to the right.
* I mostly listen to metal and during concerts, I will be somewhere in the moshpit (This fact is often surprising for people who don't know me well lol).
* I don't really have social media apart from this account, as I don't like it.

We don’t need to have the same interests, I like when people are passionate about something and I can easily get excited with them.

It’s all about that classic design and almost old-school charm paired perfectly with modern twists. I’ll take you through the highs and just a couple of less-than-stellar bits based on my daily use. It’s an honest take on why this coffee maker might be your next best friend in the kitchen.  

**Classic Design Meets Functionality**  
This stainless steel coffee percolator has an aesthetic that immediately stands out. The mirror-like chrome finish adds a polished and classy vibe to any kitchen. Compared to plastic-heavy coffee makers, the solid stainless body feels durable and has a satisfying heft to it. The heat-resistant handle and base are practical additions, allowing me to maneuver the pot or set it down directly without worrying about burns or scratches. There’s a detachable cord, which I find pretty handy for serving coffee right at the table without any messy tangling wires.

[Check West Bend 54159 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0036ws1fa/)  

**Performance That Brews with Ease**  
The brewing process with this percolator went smoothly every single time. It uses manual operation, giving me control over the entire process. One of my favorite features is the ready-to-serve light, which helps eliminate any guesswork about when the coffee is done brewing. Another thing, it doesn’t rush through the process—it brews between 2 to 12 cups in such a way that the taste has real depth and richness.  

**Convenience That Fits the Lifestyle**  
As someone who doesn’t always have the time (or patience) to scrub coffee equipment, I truly appreciate that the basket, the stem, and the lid are all top-rack dishwasher safe. Cleaning this percolator has been an absolute breeze, saving me precious time daily. Plus, the “keep warm” feature ensures each cup stays at just the right temperature when I’m entertaining guests or making a second round for myself.  

**Positives**  
Some of the key benefits from my experience include:  
- Durable stainless steel construction for a long-lasting build.  
- Easy-to-read coffee level indicator on the handle to prevent overfilling.  
- Keeps coffee warm automatically, perfect for extended gatherings.  

**Shortcomings**  
That said, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Here are a couple areas for improvement:  
- The chrome finish, while striking, is prone to visible fingerprints and smudges.  
- The brewing process, though thorough, takes longer than modern single-serve coffee makers.  

**Competing Products**  
There are plenty of coffee makers out there, but I took a closer look at some direct competitors to this percolator. Compared to the Presto 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker, the West Bend has a much shinier finish, but the Presto has a slightly faster brewing time. That said, Presto lacks the detachable cord feature, which makes the West Bend much more table-friendly. The Hamilton Beach Electric Percolator is another contender, but its design leans more towards modern minimalism, lacking the retro-classic charm that makes the West Bend visually unique.  

The West Bend percolator shines in areas like durable build and group-serving convenience, while some rivals offer quicker brewing or slightly updated aesthetics. It all boils down to what you prioritize in a coffee maker—style, functionality, or speed.  

**Value for Money**  
Without delving into exact figures, I’d say the price-to-quality ratio for this coffee maker feels justified. Its sturdy design paired with practical features like the keep-warm and dishwasher-safe components make it a worthwhile kitchen addition. If you’re someone who values traditional brewing and a gorgeous stainless steel look, this coffee percolator delivers solid value. Plus, when compared with single-serve pod machines, this is an excellent choice for larger gatherings due to its 12-cup capacity.

I treat my partners with the respect and love they deserve. Hakuna mchezo.

""I’ve been doing some soul-searching...""
""You were actually a really good guy...""

Is it the soft life or soft heartbreaks? Stability or that chaotic ""who’s texting you at 11pm"" adrenaline rush? Like, should I stop replying immediately so I can seem mysterious? Ama I ghost you randomly so I can unlock the “he keeps me on my toes” achievement?

I'm a full-time software engineer, usually doing the 9-to-5 grind during weekdays. But I had some personal project work pending and thought—why not step out and explore a co-working café vibe for the first time?

After some quick Googling, I landed on The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, mainly because it seemed like a good option and was close by. This was my first time trying to work from a coffee place (libraries don’t count!), and I wasn’t sure what to expect.

First impressions? Honestly, not bad. The place was pretty busy, but I did spot one person working on a laptop with colleagues, which gave me a bit of confidence to open mine up and get started.

I ordered a cold cappuccino (Rs. 900—kinda mid if I’m being honest), and sat down to work. The vibe though? Amazing. Can’t quite describe it—just felt lively and refreshing compared to being at home. I even found myself in a bit of a flow state.

That said, not everything was perfect. The WiFi was painfully slow (less than 1mbps—yikes), and I got asked twice by waiters to shift around for large groups, which broke my focus. I stayed quiet and went with it, but yeah... it was kind of annoying.

Still, by the time I left, I felt genuinely good. Like, better-than-expected good. I’d definitely be open to trying this more often.

Love hitting the beach on cruises, but does anyone else *always* feel rushed? Even if the gangway opens early (like **8:30 AM** at Lighthouse Point, for example), who's realistically hitting the beach *then*? By the time most of us actually get off the ship, get situated, maybe grab a coffee first, it feels like it's pushing **11 AM or later** before you're truly settled on the sand. And then, you're already thinking about packing up for that mid-afternoon all-aboard (like that dreaded 4:45 PM deadline).

Even on those back-to-back beach day itineraries – if they're at *different* ports, each day *still* has that same time crunch! Doesn't really solve the 'rushed' feeling for me, since you're repeating the same limited window. It's particularly frustrating at breathtaking locations like Disney's Lighthouse Point, where the beach and water are just phenomenal and you *really* want more time to soak it all in.

Just wish we could get *genuinely longer* hours in port for a full beach experience without constantly clock-watching. Or maybe multiple days anchored at the *same* great spot to truly unwind. Would make such a difference!

Anyone else feel this? Found any lines or specific trips that actually give you decent, *unrushed* beach time?

**TL;DR:** Cruise beach days feel too short. Even if open early (like 8:30 AM), practical start is late (\~11 AM+), then ends mid-afternoon (\~4:45 PM?). Even consecutive days at different ports are rushed. Want longer port hours or multi-day stays at *one* location, especially gorgeous ones like Lighthouse Point.",2,1746285978.0,dcl,1,1.0,False

# What is a Type-in?

[Type-ins](https://type-in.org/) are community-based, family friendly events at which typewriter enthusiasts share their love for the analog art of putting ink onto paper with mechanical marvels of the late 19th through 20th centuries. To do this they bring one or more manual typewriters and their knowledge and love of the machines to share with the community. New friends share stories, history, repair tips, working methods, and other typewriterly ephemera. Typists of all ages and levels of ability are welcome.

**Typewriters optional**  
We definitely encourage those without their own machines to attend. With some luck and the kindness of new friends, you should be able to try out a variety of machines which are present in an effort to decide what styles and feel you might consider for purchasing one of your own one day. (Please kindly ask the owners’ permission before trying a machine out.) If you’ve got multiple typewriters, feel free to bring an extra for a friend.

I started taking supplements a month ago to possibly help with insomnia.

And its been great, to say the least. I get tired and sleepy around 10pm when I used to stay up until 1-2am. I fall asleep within 10 minutes now. Focus level improved so much, I can actually finish a book, without having to go back to last paragraph because I wasn’t focused when I was reading that part.

Life is so much more enjoyable, with much less mood swings.

Only problem that I have now is that I always wake up in the middle of the night now. This used to never happened to me, although I’ve never slept for more than 6 hours until now so I can’t say for sure if this is an actual issue or my genetics just don’t allow longer sleep. I still feel groggy enough to fall back asleep within 15 minutes but it just gets annoying and hard to maintain regular sleep schedule. 

Anyone have experienced similar issue that was able to be improved by other supplement? Thanks!

Here is my stack,

Early Morning (6 am):

- Coffee 1 cup

Morning (9 am):

I came over with her favourite treats, a toy mouse, and a handwritten apology note that said:

“To Her Majesty, Betty. I regret my tone.”

She took the treats.
Dragged the toy mouse into her litter tray like it was a hostage.
Then walked over to my overnight bag and shed just enough fur to ruin everything black I brought.

I said nothing.
I went to bed.

The next morning, I found my glasses on the floor lens down.
She’d knocked them off the table. Quietly. While I slept.
I’d just cleaned them the night before. I know she knew.

That wasn’t a mistake. That was a message.

She’s not chaotic anymore.
She’s surgical.

Anyway, I’ll keep posting updates if she doesn’t start opening my post and shredding bills she finds suspicious.

1kdvfas,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kdvfas/help_with_female_friend_i_like/,Help with female friend I like,"Hey. It's my first time posting here and I'd truly appreciate your help, because I do not know how to act. First of all, pardon my English since I'm not a native speaker.

Thing is there's this girl I've been friends with for almost 2 months (I work with her). At first, I didn't even think of her as a potential romantic/sexual partner. However, we did have good rapport, like laughing, or she touching my belly or traps when talking to her, etc. It's pretty obvious that she trusted me given the fact that she talked to me about a colleague she went out with for 3 months, and she supposedly still likes, but does not want to go out with him again because he was a jerk. She has also mentioned not wanting to go out with someone younger than her (e.g. 25). I'm 29, male.

She is a touchy person, but I started to wonder whether she was too physical with me when she kissed me on the cheek when saying goodbye 10 days or so after meeting me. I didn't think of it as anything especial (tho I have not seen her do it to others), but this last week things have actually escalated. We partied together last Friday, and she danced with me. Plus, she was pretty drunk so when going back to the car, I walked with her holding her by her waist and caressed her back. At some point, she got off me in order to say goodbye to another friend, but she afterwards came back to me and caressed my back, which surprised me. In the end, I drove her car for more than an hour, and we talked about her life for the whole time, and I even put my hand on her knee to confort her and she caressed the back of my hand (at this point she was not drunk anymore). I felt this was a REALLY intimate time. There were many more physical gestures that night but I think I talked about the most important ones.

Last Tuesday, when she saw me, she caressed my face the same way you would caress someone you love (btw, she is 10 years older than me). A couple of hours later, I proposed to give her a high five and she did, but it was not the regular high five, bc she smiled, we crossed fingers afterwards and she lingered them for 2-3 seconds. That same day she told me she had a surprise for me (probably not a big thing, but still that's a sign of thinking of me). Later that day, she sent a message to a group chat we have with a couple of friends which consisted of a photo of a sunset that said ""look how beautiful"", to which I privately replied that it was not ""as beautiful as the one who took the photo"", to which she replied ""I'm not even close! But thank youuuuu 😍"".

On Wednesday, I gently touched her face when greeting, and she responded by giving me a kiss that gave me goosebumps, since she gave it to me on the bone behind my ear (I don't know if this was on purpose or not), and our other two friends were present the whole time. Later that same day she kissed my cheek as a way to say thanks because of a favour I'd done to her.

Last episode was yesterday, bc I kissed her cheek and back of the ear when I saw her, expecting her to feel the same way I did.  Some minutes later, I was a bit nervous because of some work related stuff and she caressed my face while smiling and said that I should relax.

The problem is that I have tried to deepen our relationship by talking to her on WhatsApp. She does reply and she sends warms texts, but it always looks like she does not want to have a steady convo for some reason, given that she always tells me to ""enjoy the weekend"" or that ""we'll talk when we see each other at work"".

Ealier today, I sent her a text her proposing to have a coffee with me and our other friends, in order to invite her given that she is always the one to pay. She was truly thankful but said that she already had an arrangement and that ""we'll all be together any other time. There's plenty of time left"". Honestly it did feel like a rejection but it also was a group plan so I don't know how to take it.

So, basically: how should I proceed? Her acts tell me she's interested, but her behaviour on social networks says otherwise. Should I straight tell her that I feel we have a especial connection? (not in a cringy confession way; I'm not in love with her); should I wait till the next time we party together and try to kiss her?; or should I just invite her 1 on 1 and hope? I probably won't see her again after July.

TL DR: touchy girl touches me a lot, more than others. Cheek kisses, ear kiss, even tho we know each other for less than two months. On WhatsApp, she is warm but does not look like she wants to chat. We have a couple of friends in common we share a lot of time with, and I'll work with her until the end of July. I don't wanna ruin our atmosphere, but I don't want to stop seeing her without working this out. How should I proceed?",1,1746285701.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

There is something strange happening, something stranger than normal, I'll let the tale speak for itself.""

President Eric Potentia hadn’t slept in days.

The Oval Office reeked of stale coffee and a odd scorched smell that didn’t seem to come from anywhere. Reports littered the desk—slashed livestock, mangled hikers, blackout zones spreading across rural towns. Each stamped with a red Exorcists seal, each dismissed publicly as ""animal attacks"" or ""equipment failure."" But Eric knew better.

He'd founded the Exorcists to contain what the world wasn’t ready to understand. And now, something was breaching those fragile boundaries. Something organized.

“Sir,” came a voice from the shadows. Dr. Evelyn Harrow stepped into the warm gold light of a desk lamp. Her voice calm. Always calm.

Eric looked up, eyes rimmed red. “They’re calling it a colony. But they’re not just nesting. They’re conquering.”

Evelyn slid a dossier across the desk. “We’ve confirmed Werebeasts. Werewolves, primarily. But others too. A new type—classified as Lepus Rex Mutata. Civilians call it the Werehare. Massive. Bipedal. Strong enough to tear steel. No regression. No humanity.”

Eric opened the file. A grainy night photo showed a silhouette in a snowy field—rabbit-like ears, barrel chest, talons soaked in blood, eyes that gleamed like polished dark, eyes beady like a shark's. “It doesn’t change back?”

“It doesn’t want to,” she replied.

He leaned back in his chair. “And they’re coordinated.”

Evelyn nodded. “More than instinct. More than territory. They’re hunting with purpose. Hitting generators. Communications. Patterns like they’re being...directed.”

Eric’s eyes narrowed. “By what?”

She didn’t answer.

Two nights later, Air Force One descended into a no-man’s land in Montana. Eric wore body armor beneath his suit. Beside him stood Special Agent Marcus Reyes, head of Field Ops, and a contingent of Exorcists armed with modified tranquilizers and silver-core ammunition.

The sun dipped below the mountains in a blaze of orange. A single tree nearby had shed its leaves in a shape reminiscent of a missile.

They drove through the dead town of Ashburn Hollow. Doors hung open. Blood smeared across walls. A child's wind-up toy was impaled by a pencil.

From a butcher’s shop window, a fox-faced Werebeast watched them pass. It didn’t attack. It simply nodded.

“They’re not running,” Reyes said. “They’re waiting.”

That night, under electric floodlights, they made contact.

The colony descended like a tide. Wolves, stags, bears, and beasts in-between—once-human bodies warped with muscle and fur. Their howls split the air, but they didn’t charge. They flanked.

“Cover the perimeter!” Reyes shouted. Gunfire erupted. Silver rounds tore through fur and flesh. A wereboar slammed into a Humvee, flipping it. A wereowl darted down, claws dragging an agent into the dark.

Then the Werehare arrived.

It crashed through a barricade like a wrecking ball. Eight feet tall, ears twitching. It roared, a sound not unlike laughter mixed with a death rattle. Agents opened fire. It didn't stop. It dodged and took the gunfire like they were from toy guns.

Eric watched it skewer an Exorcist on a signpost, lifting them like meat on a spit.

He raised his own weapon, fired once, twice, until it looked at him. Really looked, and smiled.

Eric ordered the airstrike.

By dawn, Ashburn Hollow burned.

The colony—this colony—was wiped out. Bodies smoldered beneath collapsed homes and shattered lights. But even in the smoke, something felt unfinished.

President Potentia stood over the corpse of the Werehare, ribs still rising faintly with unnatural breath.

“Burn it again,” he said. “Make it ash.”

Evelyn Harrow stepped beside him, her gloved hand resting lightly on his arm. “This was just one colony,” she whispered.

He turned to her. “You think there are more?”

She nodded slowly. “I know there are.”

That night, Eric dreamed.

He floated in the center of a black sea, glowing under a pale light.

The Moon hung above him, impossibly large.

A voice, soft and old, filled his head. “The Dark Angel is approaching. Watch for the light's signs, the sun will guide you.”

Eric awoke in a cold sweat, fingers clenched around the bedsheets like claws.

He didn’t know what it meant. But the next phase of the nightmare had already begun.",1,1746285446.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Listening to the thunderstorms of my heart.  
Flashes of lightning and memories

It rained the day we first met,  
Her innocent, flustered face,  
Apologizing for splashing water on me.  
I never knew that rain could be romantic.  
We drove together into that rain,  
Which united and bonded us in its magic,  
Creating memories that last a lifetime.  

A companion in our endless cups of coffee,  
The background to our midnight rants,  
Silencing our passions from the world.  
Cuddled up under the blanket,  
Rain was our love language.  

She arrived in my life like a postcard full of rain,  
Unannounced, toppling my world.  
And she left me the same way,  
As I lay shattered and broken,  
Gone to somewhere I could not follow.  
It rained the day she was taken away from me.  
Tears were washed off my cheeks,  
And I knew that forever, it would rain inside me.  

Each rain brings her to me,  
Washing away my solitude for a time.  
Flashes of our moments together
I relive every one,  
Yet it leaves me in a puddle of tears, alone.  
And I will forever find her in the rains…

Marketing strategist, spreadsheet nerd, and a little too trusting for my own good.

I’ve always been the kind of person who believes in hard work, loyalty, and keeping things organized—my calendar, my goals, my life.

Love? I thought I had that sorted, too.

Then Jake Callahan happened… and everything I thought I knew about love, trust, and control completely unraveled.

 It wasn’t just some coincidence. Meeting Jake felt like it was meant to happen.

We met in a bookstore, of all places. I was crouched on the floor, comparing self-help books about burnout, and he handed me a coffee from the café corner, saying,

*""You look like you need this more than I do.""*

And just like that… I fell. My heart flipped in a way I hadn’t felt in years—like hope had just walked in and pulled up a chair next to me. He made me feel noticed, not just seen. Like the heaviness I’d been carrying had finally found a place to rest.

About six months in, Jake surprised me with a weekend trip to Sedona for my birthday. We hiked, talked about the future, and he even said, 'I could see us living together someday.' It felt like more than a getaway—it felt like a quiet promise. So when, a year after we met, he brought up moving in together, it felt natural. A cozy high-rise condo downtown—modern, clean, and full of promise.

We picked out furniture together. Built IKEA shelves. Even argued over what color the couch should be. (He won. Charcoal gray.)

Mornings were my favorite.

I’d wake up to the sound of the kettle, and he’d already be making my tea.

*“Ginger, honey, and a splash of lemon. Just how you like it.” Whisking the tiny spoon in my favorite mug.*

I felt so seen. So… chosen.

I thought I hit the jackpot.

Jake Callahan was 31, worked in tech—software engineer, remote but always “busy.” I worked in marketing, mostly from home, but I’d head out for meetings a few times a week. People used to call us a power couple. Friends joked we were the 'Pinterest version' of adulting—him in his hoodie and glasses, me with my color-coded planner. Brunches, double dates, vision boards… we made it look easy. In our friend group, we were the standard. The couple others looked to when they were fighting or unsure. “You and Jake just get each other,” they’d say. I believed them.

He had this routine: Every Monday and Thursday night, he’d say he had to “go into the office”—late deployments, emergency fixes, whatever.

I never doubted it. Not once.

With Jake, trust didn’t feel like a decision—it felt like breathing. Natural. Automatic.

I didn’t stalk his socials. I didn’t snoop. I didn’t even think to.

I’d fall asleep before he got home and wake up to his arm wrapped around me like he never left.

There were no fights about space, or trust, or “where were you.”

I thought, *this* is what it’s supposed to feel like.

Easy. Safe. Certain.

Nothing about him made me question it—until everything did. He always came back exhausted. Sometimes with takeout. Sometimes with flowers.

I thought I had the kind of love you only read about on Reddit under *“Wholesome Relationships.”*

But then… little cracks started showing.

Like the one night I hugged him after his “late shift,” and his hoodie smelled like vanilla.

I don't wear vanilla.

Or when I noticed his texts started drying up. “Love you” became “you too.” His emojis disappeared.

I brushed it off. Work stress, I told myself. He’s tired. It had been going on for maybe two months now—the distance, the little mood shifts—but I kept convincing myself it was just a rough patch. It’ll pass.

Then one day, our elderly neighbor—Mrs. Penelope from unit 12B, the sweet widow with the teacup chihuahua named Biscuit—saw me by the elevators. We weren’t close, but she’d always smile when we crossed paths, occasionally slipping me a tin of cookies or commenting on how lovely Jake’s flowers were.

She smiled and said, *“Oh! I just saw your boyfriend on the 8th floor last night. You two moved?”*

I laughed politely.

“No, still on 12.”

Her smile faltered, and for a brief moment, her eyes shifted, narrowing ever so slightly. There was a flicker of hesitation, like something she hadn’t meant to say had almost slipped out. It didn’t sit right with me.

My stomach churned.

The days dragged on after Mrs. Penelope’s comment, and I couldn’t shake the unease in my stomach. At first, I told myself it was just a harmless misunderstanding.

But the longer I sat with it, the more that thought gnawed at me. Every time Jake came home late or mentioned he was working on something “urgent,” my mind replayed that conversation. Why would she mention the 8th floor? Why would she think he was there?

We’d been spending more time apart lately, him buried in work, me stuck in my own world. I tried to focus on my meetings, my projects, but the seed of doubt was planted, and I couldn’t ignore it any longer.

That evening, we were curled up on the couch, sharing one of those comfortable silences that used to feel like home. The TV played in the background, but my attention was elsewhere. I kept glancing at him, watching the way he absently scrolled through his phone, his jaw tense.

Finally, after what felt like forever, I spoke up, my voice barely above a whisper:

“Hey, Mrs. Penelope saw you on the 8th floor last night.”

His fingers paused mid-scroll. I could see the muscles in his neck tighten for the briefest moment, but then he turned toward me, flashing that familiar grin.

 *“Babe, she’s 80. Probably just mistook me for someone else.”*

I tried to let it go. I really did. I laughed off his reassurance and settled back into the routine we’d built. I kissed him goodnight, pretended everything was fine.

But deep down, something was stirring—unsettling, clawing at me. It was a quiet whisper at first, a feeling I couldn't quite explain. Like my body knew something before my mind did.

It wasn’t just the 8th floor comment. It was everything—the way his smile seemed different lately, how his eyes didn’t quite meet mine like they used to, the way he pulled away just a little too quickly when I touched his arm.

I wanted to dismiss it. I wanted to believe he was just tired, that I was reading too much into small things. But the doubt... it lingered, sitting at the edges of my thoughts, growing louder every day.

And I couldn’t shake it. Something inside me just wouldn’t let it go.

I wanted to believe him. I really did. But now, I wasn’t sure if I believed myself anymore. That night, I lay awake while Jake snored beside me.

I stared at the ceiling and tried to quiet the voice in my head that kept telling me that I should confront him about it.

*Maybe I was just tired. Maybe I was being dramatic.*

But good things don’t make you feel like you’re crazy.

The next day, he changed his phone password.

To users who are not aware of this, the East German coffee crisis was a period in the late 1970s when coffee shortage pushed the GDR into signing two treaties with Vietnam (1980, 1986), whereby the GDR made investments in the range of millions of dollars in Vietnam's agriculture, irrigation systems, production machinery, housing, hospitals, even a hydropower plant in exchange for receiving half of the coffee harvest for the following 20 years.

Now, my question is, if the GDR ceased to exist the moment it joined its other half, and the first usable harvest occurred in 1990, did Germany (BRD) ever benefit from the investments East Germany made? I could not find a source for this anywhere.",5,1746285363.0,AskAGerman,1,0.78,False

If you’ve been eating healthy, exercising regularly, and still not seeing results, you’re not alone. Here are 7 expert-approved tips that can help break the plateau and get your progress back on track:



**Track Everything (Not Just Calories)**

Many hidden calories come from sauces, drinks, and “healthy” snacks. Use an app or food journal to track everything you consume—yes, even that spoonful of peanut butter.



**Focus on Protein and Fiber**

High-protein meals keep you full longer and help preserve muscle mass. Fiber aids digestion and reduces cravings. Include lean meats, legumes, veggies, and whole grains in your diet.



**Don’t Drink Your Calories**

Liquid calories from soda, juice, or even smoothies can add up fast. Choose water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea instead.



**Sleep Matters More Than You Think**

Poor sleep disrupts hormones like ghrelin and leptin, which regulate hunger. Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night.



**Strength Training Is a Game-Changer**

Cardio is great, but strength training builds muscle—and more muscle means a faster metabolism. Lift weights 2–4 times a week.



**Stay Consistent, Not Perfect**

New Yorker here. Been in your country for 3 days now and I'm genuinely confused about the tipping situation. Back home it's pretty much mandatory like 20% minimum for restaurants, couple bucks for coffee, etc. But I've been getting mixed signals here. Like yesterday at a cafe in Auckland I tried to leave a tip and the barista looked at me like I had two heads. Then at dinner, I asked the server about tipping and she just said ""it's not expected but appreciated"" which made me confused af lol

I've been rounding it up at 10% just to be safe, but I honestly can't tell if I'm doing the right thing. Don't want to insult anyone by not tipping if it's expected in certain places. I've been waiting for a tax return and it finally hit like a week before coming here and just because I'm so used to how things work in the States I gave the mail guy like 50 bucks as a tip just cuz I was happy af.

Can someone break down the actual tipping system here? Restaurants, cafes, taxis, tour guides like what's the real deal? I've got another week of travel and don't want to keep second guessing on every transaction.

**Why This Pick?**

I hate to say it, but both Kyle Hendricks (6.65 ERA) and Jack Flaherty (3.34 ERA) have been rough around the edges lately. Now, make no mistake – I think the Tigers are going to get to Hendricks early here (dude got absolutely *smoked* by the Minnesota Twins in his last outing…). Detroit has made it inescapably clear that they're capable of cashing this Over all by themselves against Los Angeles – but I imagine the Angels will also bag more than a few runs off of Flaherty this evening. FYI: I’m taking an alternate line here today. I didn’t love the -125 return on 8.5, so I’m risking a potential push to shave down the price. I’m on this game to go over 9 runs, friends.

Alberta native here.I just landed (like a few hours ago) in Wellington for the first time ever for a 1 week stay (till next Sunday).  I've done pretty much no research (saved some tiktoks where they tell you what to do in Wellington and stuff) and basically picked it cuz my cousin praised it after her trip last year. Now I'm here with no plans whatsoever so I need some advice from the locals :D  I'll be staying in a place called Cuba Street (my cousin told me to stay here) and I've just been walking around. I have to say that coffee here is fucking awesome.

What should I actually do here? I have no idea what's worth seeing or where to go. I have the tiktoks, but I want to hear stuff from actual locals. I like food, walking around interesting areas (suggestions?), and if there's nature stuff that doesn't need a car that would be cool. Also into bars if there are good ones here. I've also noticed that in general everything's a bit more expensive here compared to Alberta lol Budget-wise thankfully I'm flexible since I've been picking up some extra consulting projects lately so happy to use em.

To: Starbucks Coffee Company
We, the undersigned, are writing to express our strong disappointment and concern over the removal of decaf iced coffee from Starbucks menus. This decision disproportionately affects individuals with health conditions, such as heart problems, anxiety disorders, and caffeine sensitivities, who rely on decaffeinated options to enjoy their favorite Starbucks beverages. By eliminating decaf iced coffee, Starbucks is creating an inequitable experience for a significant portion of its customer base.
Currently, the only way for these individuals to obtain a decaffeinated iced coffee-style beverage is to order a decaf iced americano. This workaround is not only inconvenient but also significantly more expensive. A decaf iced americano typically costs nearly twice the price of a regular iced coffee, creating a financial barrier for those who require decaf for health reasons. It is unfair to penalize customers for needing a decaffeinated option.
Starbucks prides itself on being an inclusive and accessible coffeehouse for everyone. Removing decaf iced coffee contradicts these values and sends a message that the needs of customers who cannot consume caffeine are less important.
We urge Starbucks to reconsider this decision and immediately bring back decaf iced coffee to the menu. This simple reinstatement would:
* Ensure equitable access: Allow individuals with health conditions to enjoy a refreshing iced coffee without compromising their well-being.
* Promote fair pricing: Eliminate the financial burden of having to order a more expensive alternative.
* Uphold inclusivity: Reaffirm Starbucks' commitment to serving all customers, regardless of their dietary or health needs.
We believe that offering decaf iced coffee is not only a matter of accessibility and fairness but also a smart business decision that will foster greater customer loyalty and satisfaction.
We, the undersigned, respectfully request that Starbucks listen to its customers and take swift action to reinstate decaf iced coffee on the menu nationwide.",0,1746284483.0,decaf,1,0.38,False

After the initial stress I found it stimulating and it was mostly fine for a while, although commuting was a stress too.

Now I'm used to most stuff (including commuting), so at work I'm either going full force at a task or being bored and frustrated about not knowing how to do something or just idling - and waiting for my manager to help or give me anything to do. Either way, I get home exhausted to the point that doing anything ""productive"" makes me want to sob from frustration, and even hobbies are too much.

Review Inside!,"The **VEVOR CM8501TE-UL Espresso Machine** caught my eye as a sleek addition to my increasingly crowded countertop. As someone who always starts the day with coffee and ends it with… well, more coffee, I was intrigued by its promise of professional-grade coffee-making capabilities in a semi-automatic espresso machine. 

**Modern Design and User-Friendly Setup**  
This espresso maker is compact yet undeniably modern in its aesthetic. Its black metallic finish feels durable and fits snugly into my kitchen setup without hogging space. Setting it up was a breeze. Out of the box, I had zero trouble understanding its parts—the detachable water tank, reusable filter, and touch screen interface. It’s not often that an appliance manual doesn’t leave me scratching my head, but this one made sense. Plus, the fact that it only weighs 6.39 pounds means I could easily move it around if necessary. 

**High-Pressure Espresso Extraction**  
The 15-bar high-pressure extraction system delivers espresso shots that pack a punch. I tested it with my favorite beans and immediately noticed the difference in aroma and taste compared to my older machine. The low-pressure pre-soaking technology seems to work wonders, even with beans that were a bit past their prime. Every cup delivered a depth I’d missed before—rich and aromatic with a texture that reminded me of cafés I can’t afford.  

[Ready for a coffee upgrade? Check **VEVOR CM8501TE-UL** now on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dj8zfrty/)

**Temperature Precision = Consistent Brews**  
The NTC precision temperature control stands out as one of this machine’s strengths. The consistent prep temperature of 197°F (or 92°C for my metric-loving friends) delivers better coffee than the uneven heating elements I’ve dealt with before. I experimented with running back-to-back cycles—it maintained its heat like a champ, with no confusing temperature drops to mess with extraction quality.  

**Milk Frother for Coffee Enthusiasts**  
As someone who loves their cappuccinos frothy and their lattes stylishly topped, the milk wand was a joy to work with. The adjustable angle is great for personalizing the froth’s density (dense and creamy versus light and airy). After one or two tries, I finally perfected a heart-shaped latte art—embarrassingly proud of that!  

**Simple Touch-Control Options**  
A soft LED touch screen lets you pick between single (1oz) or double (2oz) shots. Unlike machines that practically demand a PhD to operate, this system is straightforward, and I could get my coffee fix faster. My mother tried it while visiting, and she couldn’t stop marveling at how quickly she had her cup without mastering a “complicated barista skillset.”  

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Compact and modern design fits seamlessly into most kitchens.  
- Produces rich and flavorful espressos thanks to its 15-bar high-pressure system.  
- Temperature control ensures consistency for every brew.  
- Adjustable milk frother is versatile and offers excellent froth density for cappuccinos and lattes.  
- LED touchscreen is intuitive, even for less tech-savvy users.  

**Caveats**  
- The capacity of the detachable 1.5L water tank is decent but may still feel small for homes with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- There’s a bit of trial learning when using the steam wand depending on the milk being frothed (fat content matters here).  
- Touchscreen doesn’t leave much room for customization if you’re someone who enjoys tweaking brew cycles extensively.  

**Competitive Options**  
I’ve tried a couple of other semi-automatic espresso machines in this price range. Both the De’Longhi Dedica and Breville Bambino Plus have similar features but also notable differences. While the Dedica feels more compact, its frother seemed weaker in comparison. Then there’s the Bambino, which heats water faster but doesn’t give the same depth of flavor in the espresso as this one. However, both competitors might have the slight edge in terms of premium build materials. Where this machine compensates, however, is its superbly balanced features at a more approachable price point.  

**Quality for Price**  
Let’s address the elephant in the room: is this espresso machine worth it? For what it offers—touch screen controls, high-pressure extraction, and effective safety mechanisms (pressure release, overheat protection)—it easily punches above its price bracket. You can find espresso machines that cost hundreds more with identical features.

My sister (f30) and I (f34) don’t really talk in person since I left home but we used to have the odd chat over messenger and I would send her photos of my kids. I don’t live far away so I would still drop by with the kids to visit her but I would always have to just turn up as whenever I would organise something in advance she would make excuses and blame it on my mum who to be fair does get weird if her routine is changed or if visitors come to the house. There is a lot of undiagnosed neurodiversity in my family so this is par for the course. We always had a good old chat when I turned up so it was all good. I know it sounds a little intrusive but if I hadn’t I would never get to see my sister. She has anxiety and won’t leave the house so just made excuses when I tried to get her to go for a coffee and stuff like that. Please note, I wanted to meet up like this maybe 4x a year or something, it wasn’t like I was hounding her weekly.Anyway eventually I gave up as even though we get along great it was exhausting having to chase her and I had, and still have a busy life, so I kept it to long chats on messenger every month or so, which she participated in mutually. Eventually though, as she never goes anywhere or does anything except read her bible and paint (she’s an artist) she would have nothing to share back and started sending me religious you tube videos. I wasn’t ecstatic as I am not Christian, and she knows I don’t like religion but I simply responded by not saying anything and continued with our lighthearted chat about family. About two years of this and she stopped with the videos and didn’t really respond to my messages, which I sent every month or so, other than sending heart emojis in response to photos of my kids. I would ask her what she and my brothers wanted for their birthdays/Christmases, but we didn’t get much deeper than that. I was sad that we seemed to be drifting apart but she didn’t have much to talk about and wouldn’t meet up in person so there wasn’t much I could do. Then out of nowhere a week ago she sent me a message asking me to stop putting witchcraft on people as she had been having to remove it from people multiple times over the last 6 months. She then proceeded to ignore my messages.

Now, I live fairly close to home and my mum, who she lives with, pops by every week, so I can only imagine she is talking about me putting spells or whatever on our mother.

I panicked but refrained from telling my mum that my sister appeared to be having a mental break, as my sister normally wouldn’t like me sharing personal stuff with my mother. I waited four days for my sister to reply to my messages, then told my mum when she came by, what had happened. I said I was worried about my sister’s mental health. My mum said my sister has been acting normal, apart from she is still having trouble talking her into getting ready to leave home and get a job and my sister is just evasive whenever the topic of work comes up and prefers to sit around praying, painting and reading her bible.

It’s been a week now. What am I supposed to do? I wasn’t a big demand on my sister’s time but she appears to have decided to go no contact with me. She is now not even looking at my messages. My mum has subtly probed and told my sister I was saying she doesn’t text me much and my sister just said something over the lines about sisters along seeing eye to eye, or having differences, or something like that.

I’ve never made fun of my sister for deciding to be a Christian, just not participated in it. I have friends who are Christian and I’v never offended them. As she doesn’t have a job or much going on in her life I now worry she’s been watching too much you tube and picking up extreme Christian views from these American YouTubers.

1kdulir,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kdulir/should_you_choose_jbl_live_pro_2_earbuds_review/,Should You Choose JBL Live Pro 2 Earbuds Review for Noise Cancelling Performance?,"JBL JBLLIVEPRO2TWSUAM Live Pro 2 earbuds came into my life when I was desperately looking for a wireless audio solution with top-notch noise-cancellation and stellar sound quality. From the moment I unboxed them, their solid build quality and sleek design spoke volumes about their premium nature. They boast an alluring blue finish, which, dare I say, sets them apart from the typical black-and-white offerings that flood the market. As someone who often scrutinizes every millimeter of tech aesthetics, these earbuds didn’t just meet the style prerequisite—they nailed it.  

**Design and Comfort**  
The form factor of these earbuds genuinely surprised me. Designed with 'Oval TubesTM' and silicone tips, they fit snugly in my ears without causing that irritating discomfort that some in-ear devices trigger after prolonged use. The ergonomic shape pairs wonderfully with their lightweight structure—at just over 2 ounces, they're hardly noticeable even after hours of listening. And the stick-closed design? It’s not just a stylish choice; it improves noise isolation, which I’ll get to later. My mornings out jogging in the park were peaceful without needing to constantly adjust them—these buds stayed glued in place.  

[Find out if JBL JBLLIVEPRO2TWSUAM is right for you on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b09v9zztyy/)

**Sound Quality**  
The audio experience offered by these earbuds exceeded my expectations. Powered by JBL's 11mm dynamic drivers, they deliver the brand's Signature Sound with such clarity that genres spanning from acoustic to EDM hit the perfect auditory balance. Whether I was vibing to Fleetwood Mac or diving headfirst into bass-heavy tracks, the soundstage had depth, detail, and punchy lows. As someone who’s picky about vocals being washed out amongst instrumentals, I was thrilled at how clean and bright their midrange tones were.  

**True Adaptive Noise Cancelling**  
To be honest, I was skeptical about how effective the True Adaptive Noise Cancelling feature would be. But after testing them during a tumultuous commute, riding noisy subways and braving bustling coffee shops, I couldn’t have been more wrong. They tuned out the chaos like a charm, offering me my own sonic haven. On the flip side, the Smart Ambient feature was a game changer when cycling through city streets. It heightened my awareness of surrounding noises, from honks to pedestrian chatter, without requiring me to hit pause on my podcast.  

**Battery Life**  
Battery longevity is hands down one of this product's stronger suits. These earbuds promise a jaw-dropping 40 hours of playback – 10 hours on the buds themselves and an additional 30 hours from the case. During the craziness of my workday, I hardly noticed the need for a recharge. And speaking of charging, having Qi-compatible wireless charging made my life ridiculously easier; just dropping the case onto a pad was so convenient. The speed charging? I was up and running with four extra hours of juice after just 15 minutes. Sheer brilliance.  

**Some Pros**  
- Outstanding noise cancellation and ambient sound features.  
- Comfortable, secure fit without ear fatigue.  
- Reliable 6-microphone setup for crisp calls with reduced background noise.  
- Exceptionally long battery life with speedy wireless charging.  

**Critiques**  
- Though functional, the touch control sensitivity took a bit of getting used to. During my first few days, I often unintentionally skipped tracks while adjusting the buds.  
- While they are water-resistant (IPX5 rating), this might not suffice for more extreme wet conditions (looking at you, swimmers).  
- The glossy finish of the case, while attractive, can be prone to fingerprints and smudges.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing these earbuds to industry titans like the Sony WF-1000XM4 and Apple AirPods Pro reveals some compelling insights. Sony’s offering may have slightly superior noise-canceling technology, but they fall short in battery performance, often requiring more frequent charging. Meanwhile, Apple’s AirPods Pro excel with their seamless ecosystem integration but can’t quite match the nuanced bass JBL offers. For someone not married to the Apple universe, these earbuds present a strong value proposition with features that hit more of the right notes—literally and figuratively.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the robust sound quality, stellar noise-cancelling capabilities, and ridiculously generous battery life, this product packs serious bang for the buck. Similar devices in this league often charge a premium for comparable specs, which makes this offering from JBL feel like a lot of tech for the investment if you're looking for wireless earbuds that'll go the distance. If budget-friendly indulgence is your game, this hits the sweet spot for music enthusiasts.

A while ago, I started designing these fun drawing toys, maybe you’ve seen them already, as I shared them in another subreddit and people really seemed to enjoy them!  
Now that I’ve created even more motifs and improved a few things, I’d love to share them with you as well.

I was genuinely surprised by how many awesome moms, dads, uncles, aunts and even grandparents and great-grandparents are part of the 3D printing community! 🧡

**Here’s how the toy works:**  
You clamp a sheet of paper between the two parts of the tool (green). Then you place one of the disks into the tool.  
Start by rotating the marker with number 1 to the top and draw the line marked with number 1.  
Next, rotate to number 2 and draw that line, and so on.  
The last number is marked with a small bar underneath it. Once you’ve finished all the steps, lift the disk and the picture will be revealed!

👉 You can find the models here: [**Twist Art on MakerWorld**](https://makerworld.com/de/collections/5802116-twist-art)

I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions!  
If you have ideas or requests for new drawing patterns, feel free to share them. I’d be very happy to create more. 🖍️

**A few more things you might want to know:**  
🧲 Some folks raised safety concerns about magnets and kids - that’s why I also made a version with *fully enclosed magnets* (top right in the picture).  
🧵 Each toy takes about **40 minutes to print**, uses \~**20g of filament**, and only needs **one filament change** \- so it works on any printer, even without an AMS!  
🛠️ Not all models have the little bar under the last number yet, but I’m continuously adding it to the remaining ones.

1kdu82f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kdu82f/could_the_elite_gourmet_ec812_coffee_percolator/,Could the Elite Gourmet EC812 Coffee Percolator Review Change Your Morning Routine?,"Testing out the Elite Gourmet EC812 Electric Coffee Percolator for my daily caffeine fix has been quite an experience. I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with percolators, but this one definitely stands out. On paper, it promises a lot: up to 12 cups of coffee, keep-warm functionality, dishwasher-safe components, and a sleek stainless steel design. While diving into this product, I put its features to the test to really see how well it performs in real-world scenarios.

**STYLISH AND FUNCTIONAL DESIGN**  
Appearance-wise, this coffee percolator is a winner. The sleek stainless steel finish makes it look right at home in my kitchen. It’s lightweight and compact, which means it doesn’t hog counter space. The transparent brew progress knob is a quirky little feature; I found myself watching the coffee bubble like a child mesmerized by a lava lamp (don’t judge—it’s oddly satisfying). The cool-touch handle and snap-on lid give it a user-friendly edge, and the non-slip feet ensure stability. However, the cord wrap could be improved; I found it tricky to store neatly when not in use.

**BREWING PERFORMANCE**  
Brewing with this percolator is simple and efficient. It takes less than a minute per cup, which is great for mornings when I’m running on empty. Using the machine for hot coffee or even just boiling water for tea or oatmeal is a breeze. The percolator can handle up to 12 cups, though I typically brew about 8 cups for the household. The coffee comes out flavorful, rich, and hot, which my family loves. Nonetheless, the strength of the brew is not as customizable as I would like. If you’re a fan of fairly strong coffee, you might find the standard brew a little underwhelming.  

[Check Elite Gourmet EC812 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b09mmn1ccp/)  

**VERSATILITY AND CONVENIENCE**  
One of the best aspects is its versatility. It’s not just for coffee, which I appreciated on days I wanted to switch up my routine. I used it to heat water for tea, hot cocoa, and even oatmeal. The dishwasher-safe stainless-steel filter basket made cleanup a breeze, though I honestly prefer rinsing it by hand just to ensure it stays pristine. The 360-degree swivel base makes serving truly cord-free, and I’ve even carried it to the dining table without worrying about trailing wires. It felt pretty novel to serve coffee in a way that wasn’t tethered to an outlet!  

**HIGHLIGHTS**  
- Sleek, compact stainless steel design fits well in any kitchen.  
- Brew progress knob lets you peek into the coffee-making process.  
- Can make up to 12 cups of coffee without needing constant refills.  
- Serves more than coffee; great for tea, hot chocolate, or even cereal prep.  

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**  
Despite its many perks, there are a few pitfalls to note.  
- The coffee’s strength feels slightly limited unless carefully monitored.  
- Cord storage could be better designed to avoid tangling.  
- The percolator’s lid can become tricky to snap on after prolonged use.

**COMPETING BRANDS**  
In the realm of percolators, it’s hard not to compare this one to other heavyweights like the Presto 02811 and Cuisinart PRC-12. The Presto, for example, offers similar brewing capabilities but gets more points for its robust build and slightly quicker brewing times. On the other hand, Cuisinart’s PRC-12 offers a more premium feel with an ergonomic design. However, both competitors fall short of the Elite Gourmet model when it comes to portability and the useful swivel base. If aesthetics and convenience are deal-breakers, this percolator has its foot firmly in the door.  

**TRUE VALUE**  
Given all its features—manual operation, a reusable filter, and innovative convenience—this percolator offers good value for its price range. While it doesn’t boast ultra-premium functions, it provides solid performance for day-to-day coffee brewing needs. Perfect for anyone looking for simplicity without compromising quality, it manages to strike a balance between affordability and usability.

1kdu7is,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kdu7is/new_grinder_single_dose_vs_ondemand_mazzer_philos/,New grinder – single dose vs on-demand: Mazzer Philos vs Fiorenzato Allground Sense vs LM Pico [$1500],"I’m currently running a La Marzocco Linea Micra paired with a Timemore Sculptor 078s. While the 078s is a solid grinder, I find the workflow frustrating — I dislike the vertical grind adjustment on the front, and I have some concerns about customer service based on what I’ve read.

Initially, I’ve been looking only at single-dose grinders. The Mazzer Philos really caught my eye, and I also considered the Lagom P64 (though the P64 feels a bit too pricey, and I really like that the Philos has stepped grind settings).

I was basically ready to pull the trigger on the Philos when I did some quick research on hopper-style on-demand grinders — and the Fiorenzato Allground Sense immediately looked very appealing. It would definitely streamline the workflow.

Here’s some context on my use case:
• I mainly use medium to light roast beans.
• I rarely switch between beans — if I buy a 250g bag, I finish it before moving on.
• I sometimes use an electric grinder for large brew batches, but I have a ZP6 for pour-over.
• This makes me think an on-demand grinder might actually suit me better.
• This also brings the La Marzocco Pico into consideration.

Price points:
	•	Fiorenzato Allground Sense – $1,200
	•	La Marzocco Pico – $1,250
	•	Mazzer Philos – $1,350

The Fiorenzato seems to tick all the boxes, but I do have some concerns:

Fiorenzato concerns:
	•	Purging when changing dose or brew method:
For me, a single cup is usually 16g, and two cups are around 22g. On the 078s, I need to adjust the grind size when switching between these doses. I assume I’d have to do the same on the Fiorenzato. Would I then need to purge coffee every time I switch between doses? It feels like that would reduce the workflow advantage.
	•	Lack of numbered grind settings:
I like knowing, for example, that a 16g dose is on setting 1 and a 22g dose is on setting 3. Based on videos and photos, it looks like the Fiorenzato’s adjustment ring isn’t numbered — anyone have experience with how easy/difficult it is to make repeatable adjustments?

Has anyone here moved from a single-dose grinder to an on-demand grinder? Any advice or insights?

Kendu is over a year old and is currently on 3 chains(Ethereum, Solana and Base) with ETH being our native chain, we have around 18k holders and sit at 12 million market cap. Kendu's strength relies entirely on the community, there is no reliance on a ""team"", ""dev"" or ""KOL"", whilst it may take a bit more time and effort to grow, it means we have no ceiling. This gives Kendu an unlimited potential to grow and makes us far more stable. Kendu's emphasis on community is very similar to the 2021 method of running it up with notable coins like Shib, Doge and Pepe also following this same idea.

**Kendu's Online Effort**

Kendu is very active on Reddit and Twitter, our Twitter output matches coins in the hundreds of millions, which shows just how strong and ""ahead"" of the game Kendu is. Furthermore, on Reddit we are absolutely **number one** please check out the recent top posts on each crypto subreddit(including this one), you will see mutliple Kendu posts and you will also see our engagement is 10x the next best!!!  
We are also on Titkok, CMC, Stocktwits(shoutout to them) and Instagram. We have a pretty decent presence on all of them but Reddit and Twitter are our ""bread and butter""

In the past we have also been featured front and centre on a Coinbase Advert. Yes, an official Coinbase Advert, this advert showcased Kendu up there with the very best.

We hit 50k Certik votes to gain a free audit, Certik is an extremely reputable security based company. The only other coin to reach 50k votes was Pepe, the one that hit 10 billion outside of a bull run!!!  
Certik rates Kendu's community as 98/100, I would advise you to check other reputable ""cult"" memecoins and see how Kendu compares. I will not call them out but you can see for yourself(Hint Kendu is ranked the best), you can see the full audit here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

**Kendu's IRL Effort**

Whilst Kendu is a social media powerhouse, we excel in IRL initiatives. We are reaching a territory that no other coin has reached before and this is gonna be so attractive to retail. IRL products gives a coin some substance and it shows we are here to stay, Kendu is not some phase, we are a **BRAND**

Kendu's social media presence puts Kendu as a major player in this bull run, but our IRL dominance puts us above the rest of the competition and it is why I only hold Kendu

* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peeks. I think it will be available on Steam.
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

**My Opinion**

I really think Kendu will reach the tens of billions this cycle, we are factually the strongest community in the space currently and we all know community strength is all that matters. Communtiy strength is what defines the price of a memecoin, the most obsessed, determined communtiies always win, it has been proven time and time again. All Shib, Pepe and other memecoin hall of famers had was a die-hard community, Kendu is no different.

My advice to you is to join our telegram or subreddit, but our tg is better, ask whatever questions you want and check out our vibes. Skip the Subway Sandwhich and put the money into Kendu, at 10 billion, $15 invested now would be worth $15000!!!

**my brother [23M] took me [18F] to Spain on vacation and then ditched me in Madrid for 24 hours while he went to Andalusia to threaten an old man over Spanish Civil War collectors' items.**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a53r3h/my_brother_23m_took_me_18f_to_spain_on_vacation/)  **Dec 11, 2018**

For a while he'd been saying he would take me on a big vacation somewhere to celebrate my finishing high school. Well it took a while to put together but finally we decided we could go this Christmas season.

I didn't really know where I wanted to go, except 'somewhere in Europe', but he'd been pushing for Spain really hard for a while. I didn't really care, I just wanted to get out of the country, so I said sure.

Everything was great for the first two days we spent in Barcelona, but then we went to Madrid.

I went to bed in our hotel and when I woke up he wasn't there. I figured he'd gone to go get coffee or something. I waited a while but he didn't come back so I called him. But then I realized he'd left his phone (he does that a lot, sometimes on purpose sometimes not because he doesn't like taking calls)

It got later and later and I finally started to get really worried. I didn't leave the hotel because even though Madrid is safe, I didn't really want to wander around a big city I wasn't familiar with all by myself. And I don't really speak any Spanish. By the time night fell I was freaking out. I called my parents but of course they didn't do anything, but my dad said that if he didn't show in the next few hours call him back and we would try to get in touch with the Spanish police. Of course that just freaked me out even more and I started to cry. He also had all of our money so I couldn't even buy any lunch or dinner.

A little past noon the next day (by which point I was basically catatonic) he finally showed back up carrying this giant box of stuff. I immediately started screaming at him and I don't even think I was saying words I was so angry. When I finally calmed down a little bit I demanded to know what happened.

He said he was sorry and then he explained: a few months ago he'd been in touch with this old Spanish man online who said he'd sell him a bunch of memorabilia (flags, pieces of uniforms, cards, and some big Franco posters?) from the civil war that his father had left him. My brother said he sent the guy the money and he sent some of the stuff, but not everything he'd said he would. He tried to get back in touch with him but the guy basically disappeared and ghosted him.

He knew where the guy lived from their messages, so now that we were in Spain he decided to go down there and try to make him give up what he owed. He said he honestly thought he'd be back before I even woke up that night but he ran into a bunch of trouble and when he actually found the guy he refused to give up the stuff at first.

We got home two days ago (vacation cut a few days short) and I'm still livid. He keeps apologizing and I think MAYBE I'm overreacting a little but maybe not? I'm pretty sure that the entire reason he wanted to take me to Spain in the first place was to find this guy and shake him down.

My parents are furious at him, too. He keeps apologizing but I just can't get over it. I don't WANT to be mad at him forever but...am I the right amount of mad about this?

tl;dr my brother took me to Spain, abandoned me for a day in a hotel room while he went to another city to argue with a man who had tried to screw him over on some old collectors' items

1kdu1y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tourettes/comments/1kdu1y2/twitch_verses_tic/,Twitch verses tic,"When i was little I had these twitches. My mom called them tics, but I call them twitches now that I have a better understanding. I would tense different muscles in my body, like my legs and my face and neck, scrunching my face or rapidly blinking. My mom figured it was too much sugar or caffeine so she tried to cut it out of my diet. Eventually they got less and less until it pretty much stopped. Since then series of twitches have come back every once in a while. Rapid blinking and tensing specifically. 
Recently however, I've developed them again, and it's bad. I started them in the hospital (i was in inpatient for three weeks), where I had no access to nicotine and I limited my coffee intake. They began the week I planned to go back home. I thought it might be from the Wellbutrin I started taking for ADHD, but I've been off those meds since leaving the hospital. And since I've been home for a few weeks the twitches haven't stopped. The twitch is tensing the muscles in my neck. I can feel it coming on, the tension and the need to tense the muscles, so I do it and it relieves the feeling for a short time,  but then it comes back. So I do this over and over and over until the muscles in my neck and upper back hurt and ache and I'm so tired and just want it to stop but it's so hard to relax. They go away when I'm not thinking about it, when I'm focused on something else, but when I'm laying in bed trying to fall asleep or sitting and waiting for something I start twitching.
I tried to look up twitches verses tics on my own, but I'm confused. I also learned about dysonic tics and they sound pretty close to what I'm experiencing. I'm going to schedule a doctor's appointment soon to see if she can figure this out. Sigh.

1. Input an idea such as “Coffee shop in Austin, TX” with as much or as little detail as you want. You can even browse a catalog of ideas and templates to start from.
2. Get a cashflow chart back that shows breakeven and growth months, a table with all the levers, operational drivers, inflows, and outflows. And a flow analysis chart that shows how inflows flow into outflows.

I've just relocated to Toronto for work and I'm staying in Roncy, close to High Park, I chose this area as I thought my dog would like high park, but he's more the kind of pup that wants to just go to a flat park and have a ball thrown to him and he's got anxiety, so I think he's finding some of the bigger dogs at high park in the off leash areas a bit much. 

A bit of background - I'm 35F and lived in Armadale (Inner SE Melbourne) and Cammeray (Lower North Shore Sydney) and loved both areas. They are a good mix of quiet and still have enough going on or nearby. I like the charming tree lined streets in Roncy, local stores and sense of community.

I travel a fair bit for work, so somewhere with easy access to the airport would be awesome. Ideally if there are 2-3 smallish dog friendly parks within 20-30 mins walk that would be great. I don't need nightclubs and a ton of fancy restaurants, but a few cute shops and coffee shops and some people around my age would be awesome.

Okay, let's be real. Some days, the siren song of my bed is louder than a teenager demanding the car keys. The duvet whispers sweet nothings of uninterrupted sleep, while the world outside is a cacophony of school runs, extracurricular activities, and the ever-present, dramatic rollercoaster that is teenage drama. And let's not forget the joys of being a ""geriatric prenatal patient"" turned geriatric parent – a phrase that still makes me chuckle nervously.

So, yeah, some days I just want to pull the covers over my head and pretend I'm on a remote island with no Wi-Fi and an endless supply of chocolate. But then I remember... I have a teenager. And teenagers, bless their complicated, hormonal hearts, require things. Like, a lot of things.

This isn't my first rodeo, mind you. I'm not some fresh-faced newbie navigating the treacherous waters of adolescence. I've got an almost 34-year-old, grandkids galore (the oldest being a delightful 15-year-old), and enough life experience to fill a small library. I “should” be at the stage where I'm sipping coffee, dispensing wisdom, and enjoying the fruits of my parental labor. I should be the cool grandma who takes the kids for weekend adventures and spoils them rotten.

Instead, life threw me a curveball – a tiny, adorable, screaming curveball that is now a 13-year-old whirlwind of energy and opinions. Suddenly, I'm back in the trenches, facing the teenage years all over again. If someone had told me back in the prenatal clinic that I'd be navigating TikTok trends and deciphering Gen Z slang while simultaneously battling my own creaky joints, I might have run screaming in the opposite direction.

But here I am. And honestly? It's a wild ride.

The Geriatric Parent's Guide to Teenage Survival (and Sanity)

Being a parent in your 50s is a different ballgame. My body, bless its aging heart, likes to remind me of its limitations. A near-fatal car accident years ago left its mark, and now every ache and pain is a little reminder that I'm not as spry as I used to be. So, when my teenage daughter's schedule looks like a meticulously planned military operation, involving multiple drop-offs, pick-ups, and last-minute requests for obscure school supplies, my inner monologue often sounds like a grumpy old man complaining about the weather.

""Can't wait until you get your driver's license,"" I grumble, knowing full well that the freedom that comes with her driving will also bring a whole new set of anxieties.

But then I catch myself. These are precious moments. These are the car rides filled with awkward silences, bursts of laughter, and surprisingly insightful conversations. These are the times when she actually *wants* to share her world with me. And that, my friends, is worth more than a thousand uninterrupted naps.

So, I say yes. Even when I want to say no.

""Okay, I'll take you skating,"" I tell her, knowing my own skating days are long gone. ""But I'm going to sit this one out. My knees have declared war on gravity.""

Or, ""Sure, I'll take you to the mall to meet your friends. But I'll be lurking just outside, like a slightly embarrassing but ultimately harmless chaperone.""

We even have code words, because apparently, that's what cool parents do. It's a secret language that signals distress, a silent plea for rescue from the horrors of teenage social situations. I'm not trying to be a helicopter parent, hovering and micromanaging every aspect of her life. I'm just trying to be present, to be available, to be a safe harbor in the storm of adolescence.

In today's world, where kids are bombarded with information and pressures from every direction, being a consistent presence is more important than ever. I grew up in a time when kids could roam free, riding bikes until the streetlights came on. Now, I find myself wanting to keep my little one close, to protect her from the dangers lurking in the digital shadows. Maybe it's overprotective, maybe it's not. But I'd rather err on the side of caution.

The Inevitable Fade: Preparing for Independence (and Sobbing Quietly)

I know the day is coming. The day when I'm no longer her go-to person, her confidante, her biggest fan. The day when she starts pulling away, seeking independence, and forging her own path. And honestly? I'm not ready.

I *think* I'm ready for a little bit of independence on her part. A little more breathing room, a little less taxi duty. But not too much. Just a sprinkle.

She's in that awkward in-between stage, not quite a girl, but not yet a woman, as Britney Spears so eloquently put it. She's navigating the complexities of identity, friendship, and the ever-present pressure to ""fit in."" And my biggest fear is that she'll feel lost, alone, or unsupported.

So, I try to be her anchor. I try to be the light in the shadows, the constant presence that reminds her she's loved, valued, and capable of anything. I try to impart a little bit of my essence into every step she takes, even if it means dragging my creaky body to a theme park and renting a mobility scooter.

""You go ahead,"" I tell her, wincing as I lower myself onto the scooter. ""My cane is staging a rebellion today. But I'll be right here, cheering you on.""

I want to do more than just take her to the library or the botanical gardens. I want to experience the world with her, to create memories that will last a lifetime. But sometimes, my body just won't cooperate.

Yes, it takes a village to raise a child, and I'm incredibly grateful for the support of my family, especially my grandkids. But I still crave those one-on-one moments, those opportunities to connect with my daughter on a deeper level.

Those are the moments when I say yes, even when I want to say no. Even when my body is screaming in protest. Because being her favorite person right now makes all the difference.

The Geriatric Parent's Nightly Ritual: Wine-Glass Apple Juice and Tear-Soaked Pillows
And when the day is finally done, when the last school project is finished, the last argument is resolved, and the last ""Mom, can you...?"" is uttered, I retreat to my sanctuary.

I draw a hot bath, add Epsom salts for my aching muscles, and pour myself a glass of... apple juice. Okay, maybe it's a blend of apple and cranberry-grape juice, served in a fancy wine glass. As a Christian, I don't do the wine thing, but I do appreciate a good placebo effect.

Then, I curl up in bed with my trusty e-reader, open my Bible, and reflect on the day. I cherish every moment, every interaction, every fleeting glimpse of connection.

And yes, sometimes my tears cloak my pillow. Tears of exhaustion, of frustration, of fear. Tears of joy, of gratitude, of overwhelming love.

Because I know that tomorrow, the sun will rise, and I'll have to do it all over again. The school runs, the extracurricular activities, the teenage drama.

But I'll also have the opportunity to say yes. To be present. To be a parent.

Even when I want to say no.

And that, my friends, is a privilege I wouldn't trade for all the sleep in the world. (Okay, maybe for a week of uninterrupted sleep. But you get my point.)

So, to all the parents out there, especially those of us navigating the teenage years while battling our own aging bodies, I salute you. We're in this together. Let's keep saying yes, even when we want to say no. Let's cherish the moments, embrace the chaos, and remember that even on the toughest days, we're making a difference.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear the siren song of my bed calling. But first, I need to find my daughter's missing permission slip. Send me a prayer or two she still hasn’t cleaned her room, oh and send coffee lots and lots of Bustelo Coffee!!!",1,1746281731.0,geriatricteenmomohno,0,1.0,False

We are on our third one because the current and last ones cause him to have the hershey squirts. If switching again doesn't work, I'm trying probiotics.

The past two mornings I have woken up to shit on my rugs. The first pile was lovingly bundled up in my red rug that you see in the picture. I had to throw it away. I cleaned the litter box and didn't think too much of it, though the litter box was barely dirty.

This morning I wake up to yet another pile in front of my coffee table. Same deal with the litter box too. I'm about to lose my mind. I assumed he was trying to tell me something is wrong, as this is extremely out of character for my Clay man. I made a vet appointment and was told the same thing. They also think maybe he has parasites? But how, since he's an indoor cat?

If anyone can throw me some ideas of what could be going on that'd be great. Just trying to deal with this until the vet visit Tuesday.",10,1746281693.0,CATHELP,3,1.0,False

I'm a full-time software engineer, usually doing the 9-to-5 grind during weekdays. But I had some personal project work pending and thought—why not step out and explore a co-working café vibe for the first time?

After some quick Googling, I landed on The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, mainly because it seemed like a good option and was close by. This was my first time trying to work from a coffee place (libraries don’t count!), and I wasn’t sure what to expect.

First impressions? Honestly, not bad. The place was pretty busy, but I did spot one person working on a laptop with colleagues, which gave me a bit of confidence to open mine up and get started.

I ordered a cold cappuccino (Rs. 900—kinda mid if I’m being honest), and sat down to work. The vibe though? Amazing. Can’t quite describe it—just felt lively and refreshing compared to being at home. I even found myself in a bit of a flow state.

That said, not everything was perfect. The WiFi was painfully slow (less than 1mbps—yikes), and I got asked twice by waiters to shift around for large groups, which broke my focus. I stayed quiet and went with it, but yeah... it was kind of annoying.

Still, by the time I left, I felt genuinely good. Like, better-than-expected good. I’d definitely be open to trying this more often.

Curious to hear from others in Islamabad—any better spots for co-working café vibes? Or has anyone else tried Coffee Bean for this kind of thing?",14,1746281670.0,islamabad,19,0.9,False

I don't really travel anywhere outside my city except occassional business travel which I avoid when I can, so i wouldnt have much to talk about.
