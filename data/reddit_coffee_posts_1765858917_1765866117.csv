Eventually we realized we were both talking to the frat‑party guy. The Snapchat guy suggested we hang out and get coffee so we could post it and make the frat guy jealous. But he canceled on me twice and one of those times was literally to hang out with the frat guy. He flirts with me, but now he’s saying he feels like the frat guy and I are manipulating him, even though he’s the one giving me mixed signals.

He kept on apologizing and said na fubu nya lang daw yung babae and wala daw syang feelings, di daw nya mahal yung babae. Natutuwa lang daw sya kausap yung babae. Ready naman ako patawarin sya and kalimutan yun dahil ang tagal na din namin.. pero parang may part lang sakin na di naniniwalang di nya mahal yung babae. Is it just me and wala lang yon? Is it worth it to give our relationship a chance? Should I give him a chance?

  


Context:  I recently learned that my boyfriend has been unfaithful to me with a coworker. Nag overnight ako sakanila last Saturday and naisipan ko kalkalin yung work laptop nya for some reason.. nung inopen ko yung Slack nya (work messaging app nila sa work) nakita ko na he spends all of his working hours talking to his girl co worker. Ang hahaba ng call logs nila, 8-10 hours a day? Yung tipong kaka login nya palang sa trabaho, mukang tinatawagan na nya yung babae. May pauses in between ng calls nila pero when I checked yun yung times na mukang nasa meeting sya then after those meeting looks like he calls the girl back and would talk to her way beyond his working hours. He finishes work around 6am? and yung call nila nag eend ng 11am na halos, yun yung oras ng tulog nya e :( I also saw na he's been constantly updating the girl with his whereabouts and ano ginagawa nya over chat, sending pics and all. Sobrang back track ko, nakita ko na 3 years na pala syang ganito sa babae na yon. I even found out na binilan nya regalo yung girl, this Christmas and nung nag birthday yung girl. Ang masakit lang, hindi naman sya ganon sakin. Pag oras ng work nya, nag uupdate lang sya na naka login na sya pero he won't call me in between, laging chat updates lang kung done na sya sa work and if ano na ginagawa nya.. Mukang pag kasama nya lang ako saka nya di nakakausap yung babae pero pag nakauwi na ako and di na kami mag kasama, kausap or kachat nya yung girl. Kahit habang naglalaro sya ng csgo or dota, tinatawagan nya yung babae. Nakita ko lahat sa call logs :( Ultimo coffee order ng babae, kabisado nya. Mga chat na sinasabi nyang miss na miss nya yung babae pag matagal silang di magkausap lalo na pag may mga vacation trip kami.. May nakita pa kong chats na mukang may nangyayari sakanila, may times na sinasabe nya may work sila sa office pero mukang nag checheck in lang sila ng girl sa Airbnb and nag oovernight sila. May times na yung days na sinasabe nya saken may pasok sya and busy pero nagleave pala sya sa work para lang mag overnight sa airbnb kasama yung girl. May chats pa na sinasabi nya na mahal nya na yung girl. Nag eeffort pa syang mag travel ng halos 1 oras para lang puntahan yung babae.

Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

[https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9](https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9)

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

This is a long post. A bit of a warning.

I M20 posted a couple months ago about me and my GF F20 arguing. She said she was late to work, but it turns out she had gone to the lake with her girlfriend and her girlfriends boyfriend. However, something felt off and I told her how I felt and it turned out she was lying to me and had decided to skip work and go to the lake with her guy friend. While I hadn't met this guy friend, he was very new to my girlfriend and me as she began talking to him a couple month into our relationship. Anyway, this guyfriend became very close to my girlfriend and began driving her places and inviting her over to his house after she got off. He also admitted to having feelings for her a few times, but that he wanted her ""as a friend"". After this, I began questioning this guy. I only heard about him from what my GF told me about him, but everytime she'd hang out with him and she'd snapchat me, he wanted to speak to me and he'd ignore me completely, which further felt very odd. She was also very short when she would be on the phone with me around him.

Fast forward a month after that lake incident with this guy, he invited her to his house and she obliged and decided to go there with him late at night. She told me he was being very close and personal with him, but she kind of liked it. This disturbed me very much so. He then invited her to the club with him alone and apparently he kissed her a few times but my GF told me it ""wasn't actually him"" as he was drunk, but I felt otherwise. She said she'd cut contact with him though after that as she ""felt she was getting too close to him and wanted to step back"". Anyway, a few weeks after that and he invited her to a Christmas event, she accepted and went. I told her it made me feel uncomfortable and reminded her that she told me she wasn't going to hang out with him anymore and she asked me if I trust her. She ended up going, and it made me so uncomfortable. I was irritated, but it's like I've almost become numb to it like if I say something, everything will go down, so I just went with the flow. A few weeks passed and everything was going well between us. I managed to throw away my irritation and look to the positives, but everything that has happened has lingered with me. Last week, she posted a snap saying ""Thank you babe 😘 ❤️"", holding a coffee. I learned about this from a family member who's always friends with her on snap. She saw the post and asked me, ""Are you with your girlfriend? She posted this snap."" I went to snap to find the post and asked my GF about it. I asked her why she posted that if I didn't get her a coffee, and she told me it wasn't directed towards me. I asked her who it was directed towards and she asked me if I trust her and how it seems like I don't trust her. I told her I was simply curious who she directed that to. She told me it didn't matter but then told me she refers to her friends as ""babe"" often. I was like, ""You know what, that makes sense. Some women do refer to their friends as babe"". 

That night, we were talking it out and she told me she slept with another guy friend before we were official and asked if that mattered to me. I told her it didn't matter as we weren't actually exclusive yet. It didn't match up though. That night she referred to when she slept with the guy friend, she said his girlfriend was there with him in the same apartment. I asked her about that and she said they broke up when she was there with him and they did it after the break up. Having  been lied to before by her, I tried to believe her, but I feel so disturbed about this as the stories don't match up and she has shown to lie about this stuff before. If she was the other one in that situation, who's to say she's not cheating on me. She has told me that she cheated on her ex out of anger that he cheated on her, but she told me that she was stupid for that. I thought it was over after that, but today she sent me an sms message saying ""You can come over I will wait for you 😘😉"". This once again started the cycle again. I asked her if this was meant for me and she said it wasn't. I asked her who it was from and she started sending me messages about our sex life. I figured she was trying to change the subject. I asked her once again who it was meant for and she said it didn't matter. I told her it did matter and that if she has feelings for someone, just let me know so I can move on. I told her it was flirtatious and she denied that. She's now sending me messages telling me everything was a mistake with me and she shouldn't have been honest about anything.

I really don't know what to do. I feel like an insecure piece of shit for this,  but at the same time, my trust for her is definitely damaged and for me that's hard to gain back.",1,1765865149.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Please don’t ignore this.,"I’ve (M20) been talking to this girl (F18) I met in class about 6 months ago we had great in-person banter, lots of teasing, shared interests, and she was introverted guarded playing hard to get and shy/soft spoken in real life but way more open and flirty over text. We texted consistently for months, she shared personal stuff occasionally but nothing too deep, remembered details about me from months ago, admitted she liked the attention but said I’m the same way. Always insinuating my interest and poking fun at it but never directly acknowledging it, and even agreed to make me brownies. I asked her out for coffee recently followed up twice she hearted my comments asking her saying “oh sure!! Let me check my schedule” I told her to let me know she didn’t but kept talking to me and asked me a question to keep the conversation going changing the subject recently I asked again and she said “I’ll let you know for sure by tomorrow,” but tomorrow came and went with no word. Recently I noticed she hid her Instagram stories specifically from me when she told me she’ll tell me tomorrow. I could see on my alt account, her stories showed sushi in a dark room, roses, which looked like a date. I feel like she likes me but I dunno  and attention but was keeping me as a backup while pursuing someone else. I don’t know if i should pull back completely, confront her, Ignore it and keep it friendly, or ghost her or what? I don’t get why she’s doing this. Am I just a backup for her? A side piece? Just an orbiter? Why bother watching the show I love and recommended and trying to keep the conversation going or seem into the idea for coffee?",1,1765865051.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1pnukrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskForAnswers/comments/1pnukrq/asked_a_girl_out_on_a_date_what_does_this_mean/,Asked a girl out on a date - what does this mean?,"About a month ago, this girl that I have thought was cute and have seen around in a shared space for over a year approached me on her own and started up a really engaging conversation with me out of the blue.

I enjoyed the conversation, we made lots of strong eye contact during, and she was asking me tons of personal questions about me and my life etc.

After that whenever I would see her in this shared public space, she would always come to me directly and keep starting more similar conversations, sit by me, etc.

Eventually I asked for her number and she gave it to me. After that we started frequently coordinating schedules to meet at the place to hang out and do the activity there together as a team, with a group of friends there etc.

There have been multiple times where she has texted me late at night around 11:30pm to ask me when I would be around so we could play together and one time, I was going out of town for the weekend and she texted me at 11:45pm to say “Have a fun trip! Let me know when you get back so we can get some games in together.”

She’s a very social extroverted bubbly person in general and I am exactly the opposite.

During this time we were frequently meeting up but mostly in a group context. Her friend there would frequently manufacture situations for the two of us to hang out in the shared space together.

Anyway, what I’m getting at here is there were A LOT of signals that this girl was into me - probably more than I have ever had from a girl in the past.

Last week she texted me again at midnight and asked if I could go play with her on Monday at 2pm - which I couldn’t unfortunately, but then she rescheduled right then and there for that Wednesday at 11:30.

So we met up Wednesday and had a great time. Tons of chemistry - something which a lot of the regulars at this place have noticed (they started asking me where she was when I was there by myself, and at least 3 different friends there asked me directly if we were dating).

So I knew she was going away for 5 days this past Friday on a ski trip with her family.

I texted her around 10:45pm and said “Hope you have an amazing trip! Want to grab coffee and tell me about it when you get back?”

ALSO she told me she would show me pictures etc when she got back just a few days prior.

She didn’t respond that night or the next day, but on the following day, she “liked” my message and said nothing else lol.

Truly a wild situation with everything else during the past month getting to know each other, coordinating schedules, flirting in person etc.

My plan right now is to not say anything and just see if she re engages once she’s back from her trip.

A little frustrating because I was looking for some real clarity and I feel like she did the least clear thing imaginable lol.

Anyway what would you do in this situation?",2,1765865030.0,AskForAnswers,19,0.67,False
1pnukc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/homesolutions/comments/1pnukc5/merricks_top_drain_cleaning_secrets_keep_your/,Merrick's Top Drain Cleaning Secrets: Keep Your Plumbing Pristine,"A home runs on many quiet miracles, and among them, your drains work the longest shifts. They whisk away soap suds, cooking adventures, long-day dust, and the occasional mystery crumb. Yet when they’re ignored, they rebel. A clogged drain isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a mini-uprising that disrupts the rhythm of your home.

If you want to keep your pipes peaceful and your sinks swirling like well-trained whirlpools, here’s a fresh, humanized guide to staying ahead of the chaos. And if you ever need professional [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-cleaning/), knowing these basics will help you prevent trouble before it begins.

**Treat Your Kitchen Sink Like It Has Feelings**

Your kitchen drain is the hardest worker on the property. It goes through grease storms, pasta-water floods, and the occasional oil spill that no sponge should witness. The quickest route to a clog is pouring fats, oils, and grease into the drain. These cool down, congeal like cold butter, and cling to pipe walls.

**The fix:**  
Let grease cool, wipe it into the trash, and use strainers to catch food scraps that try to escape. Tiny potato skins can become surprisingly rebellious.

**Give Your Bathroom Drains a Spa Day**

Hair is the bathroom’s biggest villain. Shampoo bottles may judge silently, but strands of hair will happily weave themselves into pipe-blocking nests if left unchecked.

**Simple rituals that help:**  
• Add a mesh drain catcher to shower and sink drains.  
• Once a week, rinse with hot water to dissolve soap buildup.  
• Follow with a mixture of baking soda and vinegar for an easy, bubbly cleanse.

Think of it as aromatherapy for your plumbing system.

**Stop Treating Your Toilet Like a Storage Unit**

Your toilet is not a suggestion box for anything beyond human waste and toilet paper. Cotton balls, wipes, tissues, and “flushable” products don’t break down the way you think they do. They linger, layer, and eventually create a clog monster that no homeowner wants to confront.

**Golden rule:**  
If it doesn’t dissolve instantly, it doesn’t belong there.

**Keep an Eye on the Trees Outside**

If you have trees near your home, their roots may be quietly plotting their way into your sewer lines. Moisture attracts them, and once they enter through even the tiniest crack, they grow, expand, and block everything.

If your drains bubble, gurgle, or slow down with no obvious cause, it might be time to call a professional offering [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-repair-and-installation/) to investigate deeper issues underground.

**Your Garbage Disposal Is a Helper, Not a Magician**

Many homeowners assume the garbage disposal can handle everything the kitchen dares to produce. But fibrous foods like celery, corn husks, and onion skins tangle around the blades. Coffee grounds settle like silt in a riverbed. Eggshells turn into stubborn sludge.

**What to do:**  
Feed it small amounts at a time and run cold water before, during, and after use. This keeps everything moving gracefully.

**Listen to Your Drains—They Whisper Warnings**

A slow swirl, a faint gurgle, a scent that doesn’t belong—drains communicate long before they completely clog. When you notice early signs, act quickly to avoid bigger trouble.

If simple home care doesn’t work, this is when you call a trusted expert in [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/). Professional cleaning clears deep buildup, removes unseen blockages, and restores the smooth flow your home depends on.

**Final Thought**

Your drains deserve a bit of gratitude. They carry away the daily messes that make your home livable, and when treated with care, they return the favor with years of quiet, dependable service. A few thoughtful habits today will save you from expensive emergencies tomorrow.

1pnuj9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pnuj9k/i_19f_have_many_seemingly_unrelated_gi_symptoms/,I (19f) have many seemingly unrelated GI symptoms adding up combined with sleep and memory problems and new hip pain. I am not sure what's wrong.,"I have a gut feeling something is wrong right now but I am not sure what it could be. My symptoms don't add up logically. To preface this I have significant mental health issues - I am diagnosed with OCD and depression (not medicated for either) and working with a therapist (+ soon a new psychiatrist) on puzzling out whether I have bipolar disorder, ADHD, and/or autism. My sleep problems are related to my mental health issues as far as I am aware; I don't have any worrying neurological symptoms.

Here are my GI symptoms:

\- chronic constipation despite high fiber diet, the only thing that helps is coffee/tea with any kind of milk/milk alternative which gives me a normal bowel movement

\- bloody stool - I had this for a few days earlier in the month with progressively more blood each day. Then the next day it completely went away and never came back. The blood was dark red by the third day, when I wiped the amount was like if I was having a heavy period

\- prediabetes - I was diagnosed due to diet issues, I addressed these and lowered my A1C to a healthy range but may be relevant.

\- weight loss - I haven't been eating as healthy as I did last spring when I lost 25-ish lbs (intentionally and maintained through lifestyle changes). I also started the fall at a much lower baseline weight than when I was losing weight last spring. But I lost another 10 lbs. Not sure why

\- stomach appears larger than before despite weight loss and cutting out most refined carbs  until August

\- consistent vitamin D deficiency even with more sunlight and intake with food

\- occasionally VERY severe stomach pain - my stomach becomes hard and the pain is terrible. it only lessens if I sit up straight and flex my abdominal muscles and breathe deeply. it doesn't come with gas​

\- weird bowel movements where I am constipated and fart out mucus on the toilet, but cannot just fart

Here are my other symptoms:

\- irregular periods - usually every 6 months, but I haven't had one in almost a year

\- hip pain (left side) when I sit a certain way or walk. I usually sit with my legs curled to the side but I can't anymore because of this. very rarely, my knee bugs me a little

\- dry mouth corners. I thought this was normal but I haven't experienced it before. The corners of my mouth get suddenly dry, hard, cracked, and painful. It is hard to open my mouth fully. It goes away after a few days if I put a lot of chapstick or lotion on it.

\- extreme brain fog. It is hard to hold conversations and I am forgetting important tasks and events. probably mental health related

\- my sleep problems are related to my mental health but are a little odd to me. I have a very hard time making it to sleep in my bed. I just doze off intermittently in my chair/couch thing between 7pm and 4am. Then I get in bed and try to sleep more. No matter when I go to bed or where, I can never sleep over 6 hours. I just wake up automatically. I've slept 8 hours probably... twice in the past 3 years

All of these symptoms seem unrelated and insignificant but I AM concerned about the number of them. My sister has lupus and the symptoms of that all seemed unrelated and insignificant too, ​until she ended up hospitalized from a flare.

I’m currently around high A1 / low A2. My reading and writing are noticeably stronger than my speaking and listening.

I work long hours in the film industry with a very inconsistent schedule, which has made it hard to commit to regular classes. So far, my routine has been a bit patchwork:

* Coffee Break French podcast during my commute (about an hour a day)
* Duolingo sporadically
* Working through *Easy French Step-by-Step* whenever I have downtime
* Watching kids’ shows in French and listening to French music.

Despite all this, it feels like very little is actually sticking. Likely because my learning has been so inconsistent.

I’ll have a full month off over Christmas and want to use that time for an intensive program to solidify my foundation and push forward, especially in speaking and listening. I’m considering the Lingoda Sprint. Has anyone done it, and is it worth it? I’m also open to other intensive course recommendations.

In the new year, I plan to commit to a weekly Saturday class, but I’m unsure which school to choose. I’ve heard mixed reviews about:

* Alliance Française
* Learn French in Vancouver
* Focus Frame French

Or are there courses where I can do drop in classes?

If anyone has experience with these programs or suggestions better suited to someone with an irregular schedule I’d really appreciate your advice. 

Merci beaucoup pour votre aide!

1pnug1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/spoopycjades/comments/1pnug1n/stalker_from_god_knows_where/,Stalker from god knows where,"Throwaway for privacy. Hi coach! Long time fan, but never wrote in because I’d never had an experience worth writing about. I wish that were still true. 

Around a year ago, I (f,21 at the time) was working at a shady gas station. It was relatively small, so I was usually the only worker there from 2pm-10pm. I only worked there for a few months, but on my second week, this guy showed up. At first he was nice. He’s this older gentleman, maybe mid 60s, who just seemed like he needed a friend, so I was as nice to him as I could be. 

 Around one month into the job, I noticed that this guy was showing up to the gas station a lot. Like, twice a day, every day. I didn’t think anything of it as we were one of only two gas stations in town, and the man liked his gas station coffee. For context, coffee counter was right next to the registers. He’d come in, stand at the coffee counter, and make some small talk.. for nearly an hour and a half. 
 
 I never noticed when, but at some point, he started sneaking in comments about me until it was all he talked about. At first it was just “You have a lovely figure!” here and there, until it escalated to “when are you coming home with me?” 
 He’d try to give me hugs, constantly talk about how much taller he was than me (He was around 6’5, I’m 5’8,) and would only ever leave me alone if my at the time fiance showed up, which was rare as he worked from8am-7pm most days. I brushed off his behavior, which was VERY dumb of me, because he escalated very quickly. He started making physical contact. He’d rub my shoulder for a second too long, which eventually turned into him trying to grab my back, sides, and hips. 

 One day, I get a text. It’s a number I don’t recognize, but I knew it was an in state number. All it said was “you working today?” Thinking it was my coworker, as I’d agreed to cover her shift but didn’t have her number in my phone, I texted back “Yep! Got you covered.” He was waiting for me when I got there. The coworker who was working the shift before me made up an excuse about the registers being shut down, locked the doors, and pulled me to the back office. Apparently, he was asking for my number and my HOME ADDRESS. He asked if I was okay to work and if I wanted him to stay. I, stupidly, told him he should head home and I can handle it. Luckily the stalker had left by the time we were done talking in the office, about 10 minutes, and didn’t return that day. I got no other texts.

  I had the next day off, so I was on my couch watching House of the Dragon. I remember that I had heard a car outside but figured it was a neighbor getting home until there was a knock on my door. My front door had a window directly next to it, and I had the blinds open to let in natural light. I look over to see the stalker staring into my fucking house through that window. This is the moment my brain fully connected the “oh shit, this is not good” dots. My heart was so far in my ass, it was borderline making out with my pajama pants at this point. 
 
 I obviously did NOT want to open the door, but I didn’t know what to do. This guy knew where I worked, and now knew where I LIVED. He was just smiling at me through the window and waving. I go over to the door, latch the chain lock, and crack the door open. He tried to PUSH IT OPEN. I laughed a VERY nervous laugh, and lied saying “hey, i’m sick! i can’t open the door, but you know where to find me at work!” (why the FUCK did i say that?) and slammed the door shut. Just didn’t even let him respond. He knocked every so often for another 15-20 minutes, but I had gone to my bedroom by that point and was freaking the fuck out on the phone with my best friend. I ended up calling my coworker from the day previous, he swears up and down that he didn’t give him my address. 

And then my fucking phone rang. I answered it, still thinking that number was my other coworker. Nope! 
 “Hey, Gianna! (fake name) Why didn’t you open the door? I don’t mind getting sick if it means spending more time with you.” 

Heart has officially met and married the floor. Skipped the asshole entirely. I hung up, didn’t even respond. I called out of work for the next day, and told my manager everything going on. Luckily, she’s a very “no nonsense” kind of lady, and she knew exactly who I was talking about without me even mentioning a name. Turned out, he’s done this to at least EIGHT other girls in that town. One of them got a restraining order because he broke into her house. My manager told me to stay home the rest of the week, which I very quickly accepted. This next part is all retold to me, as I wasn’t there, so it may not be 100% accurate. 

  Apparently, he came in the next day and asked where I was. My manager was in the back office, saw him on the cameras, walked out, and asked him to speak outside. She had apparently tried to ban him from the store, and he had a meltdown. He was screaming in her face, telling her she can’t do that, he had rights to be there, where will he get his coffee now, etc. It took a while, but he calmed down and left… 

for my house. 

 I was napping when he showed up. The beating on the door is what woke me up. He was trying to get in, the door was shaking so hard that I thought it would break open at any point. Luckily, we had an alarm system that went off and he got scared away. It alerted the police, who came and took my statement about it. He wasn’t arrested, but they gave him a warning to leave me alone. Take a guess if that worked. My house was vandalized constantly for the next few weeks. It was egged, the banister on the stairs to my porch were destroyed, notes were left with creepy things like “you’ll come back,” and “i miss you so so so much.” until I moved away.

  My manager found out how he got my address. The coworker who’d been asked for my address left the back office unlocked, and while he was in the bathroom, this creepy ass man went into the office and searched the employee files (because /of course/ everything had to be on paper.) I still get texts from random numbers to this day, and I know it’s him. It’s the same verbiage, the same randomly capitalized letters, the same misspellings. I no longer live in that state, and I’m changing my number in the upcoming months. So, Terrance, let’s never meet again, but if we ever do, I’ve got a lot of pent up anger towards you and it’s on sight you wrinkly old creep. ",2,1765864579.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

Like a lot of you, I've tried tons of tools for organizing ideas and projects. I loved visual board apps like Milanote for planning and brainstorming, but couldn't justify paying $12+/month for something I use for personal projects and side work.

So I built Kladdo. It's a visual board tool where you can organize ideas, images, notes, and links on a flexible canvas - similar to what you'd expect from tools like Milanote or Miro, but way cheaper ($3.99/month solo, $5.99 for collaboration).

A few things I prioritized:

* **Offline mode** \- works without internet and syncs when you're back online. Huge for me since I do a lot of thinking at coffee shops with spotty wifi.
* **Privacy-first** \- your data is yours, not training someone's AI
* **Clean, simple UI** \- no feature bloat, just the core stuff that matters

I'm a solo dev and this is still early - I've got a public roadmap where you can see what's coming! Would love to hear from you all :) What matters most to you in a tool like this? What would make it a must-have in your workflow?

Turned out it was a bit of a clog, nothing serious. But either I fucked up while trying the sink or the leakage was much more serious than I thought...   
Because I soon noticed a leakage of water between the floating wood flooring boards. So I started freaking out, removed the skirting around my kitchen cupboards and realized it had been running under all of the boards and into the padding underneath around the kitchen furniture.  
  
Now, I'm struggling with anxiety and depression on a daily basis and the past few days have been bad. So I started spiralling. I was already picturing a moldy floor, and all that stuff.

I decided to dry everything accessible as much as I can and then put up some more paper towels near/underneath the accessible floorboards - after taking pictures.

So, that's where I'm at... Will it dry on its own ? Should I be worried about mold ? What can I do without removing the baseboards ? Will I actually have to ?

The only 12' butcher block counters I can find is from [Floor & Decor](https://www.flooranddecor.com/search?q=butcher+block+12ft&tab=search-tabs-products).  The options are: Walnut, Maple, Red Oak, Hickory or Cherry wood.  Obviously the Walnut would be a good choice for the actual look I like, but I don't think it will look much like the desk.  I'd love to match as closely as possible.  So looking for some advice - which one of these other wood options would match the closest to the birch desk?

there are two professors I've had this past semester that stand out to me as being really nice and beneficial to network with.  one is a creative writing masters student (I'm getting a bachelors in creative writing) and the other was my composition professor (she's tailored to the business department, but teaches english composition classes, and is also just so sweet).

is there an appropriate way for me to stay in contact with them without weirding them out?

I'm making a point to at least wait until all grades are submitted.  would it be weird to invite them out for coffee to chat after break, or email them asking them questions, or even just have a general chat?  would it be weird to make a friend-relationship with them?

maybe this sounds silly and I'm overthinking this all, but I've been out of college for 6 years due to mental health and getting back into an academic environment, as thrilled as I am, is also intimidating socially

would love to hear any professors experiences with being approached by students outside of class, too!",2,1765863593.0,college,2,1.0,False

**Every once in a while, the ocean gets bored and decides to expose the Navy’s dirty little secret:**

• We are professionals  
• Highly trained  
• Disciplined

**…But we are also absolutely not right in the head** 

I ran across an old photograph a time or two over the years. — one of those that makes you stop scrolling, lean back, and mutter, “Well I’ll be damned.” There it was: a Navy SEAL standing on the sail of a Sturgeon-class attack submarine like he was catching a clean swell on a Saturday morning. No board. No leash. Just steel, wake, and confidence.

Back in the early ’90s, *Surfer* magazine saw that same image and declared the USS Tautog (SSN-639) the “hottest surfboard in the world.” And honestly? Hard to argue with peer-reviewed science like that 

**Now let’s talk about the boat for a second.**

The Tautog wasn’t some novelty act. She was a nuclear-powered predator of the deep — built for Cold War chess matches, classified sneaking around, and generally making other navies nervous. Commissioned in 1968, she spent nearly thirty years in the Pacific doing real work: long patrols, no glory, bad coffee, worse jokes, and sailors who understood that if the boat was quiet, it meant things were going well.

• She wasn’t built for magazine covers  
• She was built to disappear  
• Which makes this whole thing even funnier 

**Perched on top of her sail is a SEAL** — knees bent, arms out — riding the wake like he just dropped into a perfect right and somebody’s filming a surf movie that will never, ever pass a security review. It’s the kind of image that shouldn’t exist… which is usually how the Navy ends up creating its best legends.

**So naturally, the bubblehead in me couldn’t leave it alone this time. I’ve learned to let most things pass, but this one kept scratching at me until I stopped and took a closer look.**

I went digging.  
And digging.  
And digging some more.......

• No official Navy release  
• No credited photographer  
• No named SEAL  
• No admiral smiling for the camera  
• No press article explaining how this made it past common sense

**Which tells you almost everything you need to know.**

Here’s what didn’t happen: this wasn’t some flag-level photo op dreamed up in a Pentagon conference room. If an admiral had signed off on this, there’d be a paper trail thick enough to stop a torpedo — and a PAO still sweating about it thirty years later.

None of that exists.

**What probably happened** — and this is the most realistic, fact-based reconstruction you’re ever going to get — is a lot simpler.

The Tautog would have been surfaced, slow-steaming, and operating in calm seas. Submarines don’t let people stand on the sail at speed unless they’re trying to thin out the gene pool. This only happens when everyone involved knows exactly what they’re doing.

The SEAL didn’t magically spawn out of the ocean either. The most likely setup is a small support craft — a RIB or similar boat — rendezvousing with the submarine at a planned point.

The boat surfaces, slows, the SEAL climbs aboard, someone says, **“Make it quick,”** and somebody else says, **“You getting this?”** 

Photo taken.  
SEAL climbs back down.  
Support craft departs.  
Submarine disappears back into the deep like nothing ever happened.

The angle of the photograph makes it clear it wasn’t taken from the submarine itself. More likely, it came from a nearby support boat tied to the same operation — and this was well before anyone had drones with 8K cameras hovering like curious seagulls.

That tracks. That fits. That’s how these things actually work.

And that’s why this image still works.

**There’s a saying some bubbleheads like to repeat — usually while looking at the deck and not making eye contact:**

# “It’s not unauthorized if nobody asks.”

**What We Can Say About the Setup** — Realistically and Fact-Based

Because there is no official documentation publicly available, the only responsible way to explain this photograph is through a plausible reconstruction grounded in how Navy submarines and special operations actually function in the real world — not how the internet imagines they do.

First: it’s extremely unlikely this photo was formally **“authorized**” by an admiral or any flag officer. If it had been blessed at that level, there would be an official Navy release, a credited photograph, a date, a caption, and somebody’s name attached to it. There would be a paper trail.

There isn’t one. That absence speaks louder than any caption ever could.

The far more realistic explanation is that this was a local, command-level moment — either tacitly approved by the commanding officer or allowed to occur informally with no intention of it ever becoming public. In other words: nobody wrote it down because nobody wanted to.

Second, submarines do not allow personnel on the sail while underway at speed. Period. For a SEAL to be standing upright on the sail as shown in the photo, USS Tautog would have been fully surfaced, moving slowly, and operating in calm seas. That aligns with basic submarine safety practices and immediately rules out any notion of a reckless joyride.

**How the SEAL Likely Got There**

The most plausible scenario — and the one consistent with standard Navy and special operations procedures — is that a SEAL team approached the submarine via a small support craft, such as a RIB. The submarine would have surfaced at a planned rendezvous point, slowed to safe speed, and allowed the SEAL to climb aboard the sail.

After the photograph was taken, the SEAL would have climbed back down, returned to the support craft, and the submarine would have gone on its way. Submarines do not conduct open-water personnel transfers without another vessel present, which strongly supports this explanation.

**Who Took the Photo**

The angle of the photograph suggests it was not taken from aboard the submarine itself. Instead, it was almost certainly shot from a nearby support vessel accompanying the SEALs or participating in the same operation. That fits both the visual evidence and standard practice for documenting anything at sea — especially something that wasn’t meant to be documented in the first place.

It’s also entirely plausible that one of the photography-inclined SEAL team members took the roll of film down to the local drugstore to have it developed — back when that’s how these things actually worked. Which suggests this image was probably the best shot out of five or six attempts, the rest quietly set aside.

Part II of my honest, salt-of-the-earth sailor deduction? Somewhere along the line, a phone call was made — or an envelope mailed — to Surfer magazine. Any money that came back likely went straight toward covering the bar tab of the offending SEAL team members present, who are probably still telling that story today… just not in writing.

**What We Can Rule Out**

There is no credible evidence linking this photo to:

• A flag-level directive  
• An official Navy public affairs event  
• A planned media operation  
• A credited *Surfer* magazine feature with supporting documentation

If any of that were true, there would be receipts. There aren’t.

**In the spirit of Cdr. Eugene B. Fluckey:**

# “You don’t survive submarines without learning when to be serious… and when to laugh.”

The enduring appeal of this image likely comes from the fact that it was never meant to be a headline. It appears to have been a brief, informal moment during a legitimate operation — captured by chance, remembered fondly, and later adopted into naval folklore.

Sometimes the best sea stories survive precisely because nobody ever wrote them down.

Now, unless somebody’s planning to fess up in the comments — and I strongly suspect that ain’t gonna happen — we’ll probably never know exactly how a full-blown surfing operation took place on top of a multi-million-dollar nuclear attack submarine.

Somewhere in this story, there was almost certainly a commanding officer involved. A real one. The kind of skipper who looked at the situation, weighed the risks, glanced around real quick, and said something like, **“Alright… make it fast.”**

That man probably never made admiral.  
And if he did, he sure as hell isn’t talking about it now.

Was it planned? Maybe.  
Was it “official”? Not on paper.

**Was it strongly discouraged about five minutes later?** Almost certainly.

And that’s the beauty of the Silent Service 

If the real story ever surfaces, it won’t come from an archive — it’ll come from a comment section. You’ll see a few knowing laughs. A couple of sideways emojis. Maybe a quiet 

And if anyone actually involved shows up, I’ll tell you this right now:

If they’re wearing dolphins, they’ll stay real quiet 

**Because that’s how it works.**

We don’t rat.  
We don’t brag.  
We don’t explain.

We just nod, smile, and let the legends do the talking.

1pntwd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1pntwd3/mine_to_all_too_wellto_honey/,Mine💜 to All Too Well❤️..to honey 🍯❤️‍🔥,"Hello!!!! I have had this thought since eras tour and the eras tour documentary and final show movie finally motivated me to try to write it all down because I love this sub and y’all’s brains and want to hear your thoughts too!!

Basically, I believe one meaning and story behind Mine and All too well is the story of Taylor and her fans, the love affair from the magical enchanting beginning to cold bitter end. 


So, before I begin talking through the lyrics, a few important things:

**1. I believe red, the color, throughout Taylor’s discography, represents the distance between her and her true self ( and in turn between her and us) as well as overall the patriarchy and things like comp-het that cause this (hopefully that makes sense)**

**2. A deluxe version of speak now was in the color red, not purple. I think this is alluding to what is coming next (Red as in the album is coming but also red as in the chapter of a real authentic relationship with real Taylor/ the fans is over/ending)**

**3. Mine was the lead single for both speak now and speak now TV. However….red OG led with “we are never ever getting back together” (perhaps a more guarded version of all too well, after we get into my analysis) and then red Taylor’s version got ATW10MV instead….**

**4. I think a lot of us in here see the story she is telling right now through performance art and also that she has told us how she did what she did/ is doing to protect herself and her personal life fiercely. From the fans, unfortunately. That’s why part of the eras and re-recording focus were on these two incredibly important songs, because they really lay the groundwork for this first major heartbreak that spurs so many things into motion after**

Ok, so, onto the lyrics, starting with Mine:

*You were in college, working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts*

one thing that I believe Taylor does repeatedly through her discography is speak about her fans and the non-celebrity lives they lead, college, jobs, etc- she sees the fans, loves the fans, this is her first real love. (See also: teal shirt at the yogurt shop). I think she also speaks to them literally when she says things like “put on your headphones and burn my city” because we literally are the ones listening to her music. Not a romantic muse. 


*i say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine*

so the magical beginning or first time she is describing here is before things were muddier, tainted with PR, stained RED (which is extreeeeeeemely important for the ties to ATW 10MV). Since Tim McGraw she has also said she wants us to associate her songs with all of our most special moments, etc. I think sitting by the water putting our arm around her is when we fell in love with her music and a more authentic Taylor (again, before all of the PR). Taylor also isn’t a rebel, we made her a rebel, a star, etc. this new persona wouldn’t exist without the fans. 

*Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to t ake
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about….*

During the speak now era, Taylor is already really famous. She’s been in this now for a few years and we have amassed a drawer of her merch at our house (this can have double meanings related to merch but at this point the fans still have some shred of her authentic self as well and this is a very important relationship - she believes (naively) for both parties (which is impossible to have with a group of fans who consume your life like animals). 

However, she ends the song reminiscing again, on the times that were spent together, reassuring the muse that it is a strong bond, even reflecting on a time when we took her back after a scandal (of some
Sort - could be one interpretation of the fight at 2:30AM). 

*Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water ….*

….*i remember it all too well*


Ok so now we enter some of the lyrics to All Too Well ……where we go from the beginnings of this relationship to the drawn out painful end


*i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something ′bout it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you′ve still got it in your drawer even now*

Ahhhh the red scarf. So I think this is referencing, after we’ve begun relentlessly attaching muses to young Taylor’s songs,the amount of the real Taylor in our lives (and hers) that was shrinking. 

What was once a drawer of her things, is now just a scarf. 

**a red scarf**


*Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days*

Here again we are affectionately remembering what was once there, before the great divide began to grow wider and wider.  She is describing them as young and innocent. 

*And I know it's long gone and tha t magic′s not here no more
And I might be okay, but I′m not fine at all*

*Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red ′cause you were looking over at me*

This line gets me because if red is things like patriarchy (even comp-het at times), then almost running the red would be describing the times that we alllllllmost got it. 🥺People start to get so close to the truth of her lyrics at times but ultimately they *almost* ran the red. 

I think we also all can relate to the glimmers of hope you try to see at the end (denial)

They/we didn’t run the red. Much like in Wicked, the ruse is easy to maintain if the people want to believe it because of forces that strong. 

*Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories ′bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me*

 So first this part is another that reads extremely literally in terms of recounting situations with the fans-hundreds of whom have met both her mother and father over the years

She also importantly calls out that the fans cheeks are beginning to turn red - the blushing is yet another reference to this growing divide. This comes as the photo album is on the counter…or we start seeing more and more orchestrated pap walks. As she got older more and more of what the fans and world wanted from her was heteronormative BS. 

*And you were tossing me the car keys
""F- the patriarchy,"" keychain on the ground*

This next section here I think is representing all of the toxic back-and-forth moments of not accepting what is over,toxic,unhealthy,fake. 

We’re tossing her the keys to run away but … it’s not authentic. We metaphorically tossed our “fuck the patriarchy” keychain to the ground because the patriarchy is what is causing us to force her into this box. Ironically, she made us all shout this together at the tour as well (😜love this) 

*We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
""Any time now, he′s gonna say it's love""
You never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it′s the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame*

 This is more self denial - the process of saying goodbye to this relationship and knowing that this relationship can never be good and pure because it is so tainted by lies and she also sees we are never going to see the truth because we are so blinded. 

*And I know it′s long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to*

The remembering is the hard part here, this magical moment from “mine” is still living in her head. Remembering it all too well is repeated so many times for a reason  

*Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We′re dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we′d swear
To remember it all too well*

 More reminiscing on the good times (noticeably again throughout her discography most of these good times involve dancing and/or music. Not to bring it up again …but really to look back to look forward, if you will, Tim McGraw is such a beautiful first song in her discography because I think she has been telling us all along that’s how we can have this special relationship with her is through these special moments with her music

**(similar to how she told us to associate her eras tour songs with eras tour memories moving forward**

*Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well*

Lost in translation = the truth she buries in her music that the red/distance prevents us from seeing. The masterpiece = the layers of truth and meaning in her music (but if taken at face value ie to be about beards it is not a masterpiece, the meaning is twisted and flattened and she becomes a symbol for things that do not represent her) 

*And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I′m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all*

 Even with the distance and the protective layers she will begin to build to (ie rep Taylor) … she will never truly be immune to things the fans say at all times. And it will never truly not hurt, regardless of how much protective armor she puts on, because she will always remember the special magical time at the beginning. Again, this remembering is what crumples her up like a piece of paper. 

*They say all's well that ends well, but I′m in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy ever, lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom, some actress asking me what happened
You, that′s what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It′s supposed to be fun turning 21""*

 Again, I think a lot of this can be taken very literally in terms of the story telling. Fans met her parents repeatedly…and she let them into her life. But then at the end of the day this new persona that she built to protect herself ultimately leads to isolation - she can barely go out in public anymore. Hence the “it’s supposed to be fun, turning 21….” Line. I believe completely that this is even something her parents may have said to her earlier on in her career. Things like “hey, maybe this is actually going to hurt you, enjoy your youth, it’s not too soon to stop, etc” but by the time you’re turning 21 you have some autonomy (and she does admit in **many** songs she made the choice to beard after a point. I believe “seemed like the right thing at the time” )

*Time won't fly, it′s like I'm paralyzed by it
I′d like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things, and I walk home alone*

Here, Taylor is even saying that she doesn’t know/ can’t find her old self. And describing the isolation of her life, because the fans could again, never be a real relationship. 

She will describe this “walking home alone” more times later, as well (to a house not a home all alone cause nobody’s there - dear reader)

*But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me
You can′t get rid of it ′cause you remember it
All too well, yeah*

*Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you′ve ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it
All too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all*

*it was rare, I was there, I remember it
All too well*

Throughout the rest of the song and outro the reassurance to herself that the reader remembers it too is repeated many times. I think this is her trying to make herself feel better, to reassure herself that this was, indeed, once something real. It wasn’t just in her head. 

*And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age*

I think this is clever because it references men who date younger but also that the fans will replace her with a young pop star who is her current age  

*From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I′m a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?*

I think the “just between us” is worded this way because this is not a healthy relationship that anyone sane would think you should be putting this much stock in. Similar to how your family/ friends would tell you to move on if something was unhealthy to continue obsessing over. She is declaring that it was, in fact, that special to her, and asking, please, just between us, tell me it was to you too. 

*Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well*

I need to analyze the lyrics of snow on the beach but part of my spider senses tell me that could be connected here as well. I cut out the rest of the outro I referenced above as the same thoughts apply, it is a plea.

I want to close this out by saying that although I think these 2 songs were highlighted so intentionally by Taylor to tell this story during eras, these themes and symbols obviously continue throughout her entire discography and I think that she tells the story of this relationship many many more times and in other ways, similar to how she discusses her relationship with herself and her fame many times. 

I believe that this is all going to end and Taylor is going to be golden **in the daylight** not just in private. I’m not going to analyze the entire song bc this got aggressively long, but I believe in “maroon” she is using these rusted reds to symbolize the way her showgirl persona has tainted her legacy and made it not what she would want it to be. 

however, you could tie honey, in showgirl, as the happy ever after to all too well, when she is in the daylight, particularly as honey is the color of gold and in honey **the words are not lost in translation - you give it different meaning, because you mean it when you talk**.

Could even be referencing those who already see her songs and truth for what she is saying already … wink wink to y’all 🫶🫶🌈🌈particularly as we might speculate some labels she flags and mean them in a positive way, not a negative one.

1pntu9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1pntu9d/26m_need_advice_moving_forward_or_not/,"[26M], need advice moving forward or not","So, I connected to a girl (26F) whom I on a matrimonial app 3 months back. Initially, we started exchanging formalities on the app, then moved to Insta, then to WhatsApp & then to daily calls. She has hidden her profile on the app and so have I. There’s a lot of similar views, opinions, etc. Neither of us is in a rush to marry so the goal is to first gauge compatibility, no matter how long it takes. I have started liking her personality ( she’s peaceful, calm, mature, responsible, etc) and I guess she has similar feelings, since she’s consistent in initiating communication and takes an active interest. Both of us work in IT field but in different cities ( I have WFH, so I stay in my hometown) so we haven’t got a chance to meet yet, although both of ours hometown are nearby so we might meet for a coffee in December end, while she’s home.

There has been no talks of exclusivity, commitment, etc yet. But of the late something’s started bothering me. She is getting more inclined to government jobs and has started preparation for it and while I do not have any business whatsoever to tell what she should/shouldn’t don’t do but I am starting to rethink everything. My main concern is if she were to crack the government job, and if we have really moved forward with each other by then, then there’s a high probability that this will mean a permanent LDR kind of thing since I don’t intend on moving out of Software/IT ( I’m doing pretty well ) field and most of the good jobs in software/IT jobs are concentrated in tech hubs and while I have WFH now, the case might not be in future. I am uncomfortable with LDR primarily because I have seen it seldom work and even if It does, it’s always gets caught up in time-slotting, travelling, etc etc  and I need meaningful companionship ( I am a single child, been alone all my life and don’t intend to continue the same lifelong ). And while some might say, we are currently in different cities so even if we get into a commitment it will be a LDR, but thing is if both of us are in software/IT,  then it can work by moving to common location, etc.

There’s one more thing, I have a chronic health condition for which I take medication daily. 2-3 days into the calls when she started sharing her life, family, etc I felt I should be honest about my condition, since I believed she should have complete information before going any further and I told her, I would understand if she were to stop talking/ backout anytime now or in future because of this. Initially, she was bit apprehensive like what this would mean in future, etc etc but after my reassurances we’ve been talking normally since then.

Honestly, if the situation were reversed, I don’t know what would be my approach and that’s the reason why I am not discussing this topic with her yet. So, what should I do? Should I end whatever is going on now with her so as not to get hurt in future or is this my overthinking and I am sabotaging a potentially genuinely good because of my immaturity or should I give it some time and see where it goes ?

TL:Dr,  
Met a 26F on a matrimonial app \~3 months ago. Moved from app → Insta → WhatsApp → daily calls. Both hid our profiles, not rushing marriage, just gauging compatibility. We get along well and there’s mutual effort and interest. Haven’t met yet due to different cities, but may meet for coffee in December.  
Concern  
She’s started preparing seriously for government jobs. If she cracks one, it likely means a permanent long-distance setup, which I’m uncomfortable with.

The town of Majenica has around 80 permanent residents. It is little more than 24 houses. It has no post office or general store. There is a gas station, but it closed back in 08. The town is the halfway point between the interstate and an actually notable town. The only real draw to Majenica was the fact that it had the church. If you lived in the area you have undoubtedly heard of the church. Saint John’s - Bastion of Faith. It was much larger of a church than a town like Majenica warranted. I’m not entirely sure how the town afforded the building. It was a big beautiful building with well designed limestone and brick. The windows were massive, beautiful portraits made of stained glass. I had never gone there myself, but most people in neighboring towns attended the Sunday services. 

I stopped being involved with church after my father died. I fell out of the routine. Too many people told me it was “god's plan”. What a load of horse shit. Their insistence upon the matter only made me more upset. That was a few years ago however. It’s been long enough now that I'm ready to try it again. I’ve been talking to my family friends and they asked me to join them this next sunday. Everyone who goes talks about the church fanatically. I figured that I might as well try. 

Part 1

I woke up that Sunday at 10 am. I was still tired from the night before. I didn't get much sleep. I was still dreading the idea of a pastor rambling on about his warped interpretation of the Bible and how my life is in peril. I pulled myself out of my bed regardless. I put on my Sunday best, which happened to be a polo shirt I got from a thrift store and some black slacks from the same thrift store. I looked presentable. I decided to skip breakfast as that would take too long. I wanted to get there early. If I was lucky I'd be able to find the people I knew and I'd sit with them. I walked past my kitchen, grabbed my keys, and walked out my front door. 

The morning greeted me with a gray misty rain. It was rather brisk out, but it was honestly quite pleasant. I decided to open my door and grab my sweater. I tossed it over my polo shirt in order to keep some warmth. I walked through the rain to my car. My key fob was always finicky. This meant that I had to press the unlock multiple times before the headlights of my car blinked signifying that the doors were indeed unlocked. I hopped into my car, slightly wetter than I would've liked. I plugged my phone into the cassette tape/aux cord. It was something I picked up from the hardware store here in town. I put on some music before starting my drive to church.

Once arriving I find it very hard to find a spot to park. I was about a half hour early, but the parking lot was full. Every spot has been taken. Some of the patrons took to parking on the grass. I was hopeful that my car wouldn't get stuck in the mud. I decided to go for it. I walked through the grass into the parking lot. The parking lot was quite large. Unfortunately for me, I had a small walk ahead of me. I should have brought my umbrella. “It’s too late to go back now though.” I thought to myself. 

Approaching the big wooden doors of the church, I was a little intimidated. I looked up at the massive windows collecting rain. I turned to look back at the parking lot and thought about leaving. I was psyching myself out for no reason. I was not going to leave now. I pushed open the solid oak doors. The inside of the church was just as breathtaking as the outside. The roof was ornate and wooden. The stage was marvelous. The air inside was warm like a blanket from the dryer. There were people everywhere. I began to feel out of place. I looked around for people to talk to or something to do. That's when I noticed the little coffee bar that they had inside the church. It was embedded in the wall and the room could really only fit 3 people. It looked cozy though. I walked up and asked for a cup. I had skipped breakfast and groggy, I could use the pick me up.

The cute girl behind the counter asked if I was new. It must've been obvious. I was looking around in amazement and wasn't talking to anyone. I admitted that I was a newcomer and I was a little nervous. She giggled at that. Usually that would have embarrassed me, but her voice was so soothing that it eased my concerns. She pointed to a spot in the middle of the room on the left side of the pews and recommended that I sit there.

“It's cozy over there. It's out of the way, but you get a good view.” 

I thanked her for the advice and tried to pay for my drink. She smiled and told me that the drink was free since I was new.

I walked to the area she pointed out for me and took a seat in the far end of the pew. I continued to look for my friends, but they were lost in the sea of unfamiliar faces. It was hopeless. I sank into my seat and drank my delicious coffee. Despite my friends being elsewhere, I was actually quite content and cozy. I was excited to see if this sermon was really going to be life changing. 

I waited about 12 minutes before the lights dimmed. I had chatted up some elderly folks in the meantime. They looked like the kind of old person that had very little time left. Purple skin around their arms indicated that they bruised easily. I felt bad for them, but they seemed as cheerful as ever. The lights became very atmospheric. They illuminated just enough to keep the room visible. It was like going to the movie theater when they play the trailers. The crowd went quiet. Everyone was waiting for the pastor. I was intrigued. I could feel the anticipation of everyone around me.

I heard a man's voice projecting from the speakers on stage. He had a golden tone to his voice. He walked on stage and I was confused. He wasn't exactly what I imagined in my head. He was no older than 50. He looked to be wearing a twill suit, the kind with the large checkers on it. He was quite handsome. The spotlight shined down upon him as he introduced himself to the crowd. 

“Hello people. I am pastor Zacharious. Today is a special day. We are going to be performing miracles”

With that the entire room erupted in cheers. 

“What the hell? Miracles, really? Maybe this was more of a cult than a church.”

I was uneasy, but I decided to stay. I was probably just over reacting. He went on.

“I see a few new faces in here today, let's not scare them off, okay? If you see someone new, make them feel welcomed and introduce yourself. It makes me happy to see our union grow so much over the last several years. Today the Lord will thank us for all our hard work. We have been planning this holy day for a few weeks now. Now it is finally time to produce the miracles I promised you.”

Again applause.

“Before all of that we must praise our Lord in song”

I thought to myself.
“Oh shit, fuck me. I didn't really want to sing hymns today.”

I had completely forgotten that this was a part of church. I scrambled to find a hymn book as everyone had already stood up and opened the pages. Kindly, a stranger handed me their book and pointed to the area we would be singing from. I was very appreciative of that. 

It was some generic song about how Jesus is Lord and how we aren't grateful enough for his salvation. Call me cynical, but they all sound the same. After singing, I thought we'd be sitting back down. Instead, the pastor beckoned the crowd to the stage. Everyone flocked the stage in a frenzy. I was startled. There was shoving and screaming. It was anything but dignified. I backed out of my pew and clung to the wall, watching in utter confusion. The people washed up to the stage like a roaring wave. The pastor reached down to a few of their heads and grazed them with his hand. Every person he touched seemed to faint out of pure excitement. I was creeped out. Right as I turned to leave, the cute barista was beside me. She scares the shit out of me even more than I already was.

She hurriedly responded trying to calm me down.
“Oh my goodness I'm so sorry, are you alright”

I told her I was fine and that I was just disturbed by the events going on. I told her that I was probably going to leave.

She sounded like a disappointed mother.
“Leave? But you haven't even witnessed the miracles.”

“What? What're yo-”
I turned around to see each crowd member grazed by the pastor's cold hands suspended in air. They emanated a holy glow. The light emanating from them was warm and bright. It lit up the room. I stopped mid sentence and every other thought in my head ceased to exist. 

I said in utter bewilderment 
“Oh my god.”

She said innocently.
“I know, isn't he amazing?”

I whipped my head between the girl and the act of God that was currently happening at the foot of the stage. 

I thought to myself.
“Is she really acting as if this was completely normal? Is this completely normal? How often does he do this? What happens next?”

 I needed to know more.

I sat back in my pew and clapped. I didn't know what else to do. The glowing ones slowly descended. People cheered again. The pastor said that was all he could do for this week. He took a knee as if it had drained him. 

When the pastor was done handing out miracles everyone returned to their seats. I noticed that the elderly couple who had conversated with me before the sermon were heading back towards their seats too. They seemed different. Their skin was no longer bruised or thin. They looked younger? A lot younger, by about 10 years.

“What the fuck” 
I thought.

The sermon continued like a normal church for a while longer. After the sermon ended. The pastor said as charismaticly as a politician.

“Will those new to our union join me in the front. I'd love for the chance to meet you all.”

The rest of the congregation fled to their respective lives. Me thought? I was going to meet this pastor. I walked to the front. I was both excited and nervous. On my stroll to the stage, I noticed that I was the only newcomer. I looked around looking for the other “new faces” the pastor talked about. 

He chuckled when he saw my confusion.
“Oh boy don't worry, it's just you. I just didn't want to make you feel too targeted. I said “new faces” to put you at ease.”

I thought to myself.
“He noticed me out of the 200 or so people in the church?”

We talked for a bit. He said that it was great to have more members in the church and he told me about his time teaching God's word. I listened in pure fascination. He was an even better story teller than I had previously conceived.

He ended the conversation with a request.
“Well I have to attend other business” he then pointed at his stomach signifying he was going to go get lunch. “But I wanted to personally request that you do come again next week.”


I said as cautiously and politely as possible.
“thank you sir, it was great to meet you”

I instinctively stuck my hand out to shake his, but he recoiled as if my hand was a venomous snake.

“Oh sonny, you don't want to do that. My hands are capable of a great number of things.”

Instead he gave a gentleman's bow. 
With that he walked away.

Part 2 

I didn't know what to think about that church. I didn't know how to feel about what I had seen. Did the pastor really have a gift from God? The only thing I know is that those people were really floating in thin air. The couple that came back from being “blessed” were younger too. That wasn't made up either. I had to go back.

The whole next week felt unimportant. Work was boring. Home life was boring. I wanted it to be Sunday morning everyday that I woke up. Unfortunately for me, the days moved at an abnormally slow pace. I had hoped the excitement would make the time fly, but it didn't. It felt as though that week took a month. That was until Saturday night. I decided to go to bed early that night. I wanted to be awake for the sermon. I also didn't want to be hungry like last week. I was worried my excitement would keep me awake all night. My head hit the pillow and before I knew it, it was morning.

I was ecstatic. I jumped out of bed. Church didn't start for an hour so I had plenty of time to make a small breakfast. After that, I decided to wear something nicer than some second hand slacks and a sweater. I dug through my wardrobe to find my nicest button up shirt that I would wear for job interviews. The shirt was thick, white, and fit me well. I found a gray cardigan that I stole from my friend a few years back. All that remained was the pants. I didn't have much in the way of fancy pants. I decided to wear the same khakis I wore when I worked retail. They were a part of my uniform and I never considered them nice. However when you toss the pieces together, I looked rather presentable. I inspected myself in the mirror for multiple minutes before I convinced myself that I didn't look ridiculous. I hardly dressed up and it was odd seeing myself try.

The morning was cold that day. No rain, thankfully, but still cold. The dew on the ground was thick. Looking around my neighborhood, there was a slight fog. I shivered, glad that I wore the cardigan. I sat in my driver's seat and cranked the engine. My frigid leather seats were very good at cooling me down even further. The heater in my car could not heat up fast enough. I was shivering and losing the dexterity in my fingers. I had to drive about halfway to the church before the temperature in the car was comfortable.

The parking lot was just as packed as last week, but I didn't have to worry about the grass being mush this time. The dirt was as solid as a rock. I hopped out of my old vehicle and felt the morning dew seep through my shoes. It was frightening how fast the water got to me. I jogged to the church doors hoping that it might warm me up a bit as well as get me inside sooner. The door of the church was heavy, but once inside I could feel the wonderful sensation of heat wrapping itself around me once again.

I decided to skip the coffee today. Not only did I not need it, I also didn't want to pay for it this time. However, I waved to the barista. She didn't seem to notice, but I wasn't too concerned about it. I walked to the same section I sat in last week. The former octogenarians were sitting near me again. I decided to ask them about the “miracles.”

“So are the miracles always the same?”
I asked a little more intrusive than intended.

The man replied politely.
“Oh, no. We never really know what's going to happen.“

His wife added, excitedly.
“Yeah, we got lucky”

I quickly replied.
“Wait what do you mea-”

Before I could finish my thought, Zacharious’ voice boomed from the speaker. He sounded excited. He came out in the same checkered suit as last week. He wore a big smile showing his perfect teeth. He had wrinkles on his face from smiling so much. I could have sworn he looked at me and winked. He captivated his congregation.

“Hello hello hello. Welcome to Saint John's. I hope we're all having a good morning. I know the Lord is looking down and guess what people. He is happy. Why? Because we are here to worship him. Shall we sing to our Lord.”

I noticed he didn't mention anything about miracles. Everyone rose and grabbed a hymn book. We sang and sat down. No rushing of the stage. No floating church members. I felt so let down. Feeling let down made me feel guilty. I was here to worship, not to watch the pastor do magic. I was lost in thought. That was until I heard him say something.

“Alrighty folks, as you may know we have a new member in need of baptizing.”

I panicked because I wasn't ready for this. I was relieved to see someone else join the pastor on stage. He was wearing an all white jumpsuit. 

“He says he swears his body and soul to our Lord. But this will be no ordinary baptism. This will be a test of faith. Now, many people know the story in the book of Daniel. The men did not burn in the furnace because why? Their faith in the Lord. They had faith that they would be protected. Dipping yourself in water doesn't prove you trust your Lord and flame can cleanse better than any amount of holy water.”

With that a bed of flames emerged from a grate in the stage. No one was startled besides me and the man in white. I could see his face contort into terror. I could tell he was not involved in the planning. He clearly had no idea this was going to happen. He gave a nervous laugh to try and break the tension. It didn’t work. The pastor beckoned him to the flames.

“Do you trust the Lord to protect you son?”

He looked at the flames in terror, but threw himself closer and closer to the fire. Step by step. The flames nipped at him causing him to wince in pain. He jumped back out of instinct. The pastor looked disappointed in the man. 

“Sonny, you have to believe in the Lord to save you or else you won't get into the kingdom of heaven.” 

The man in white shook his head in an attempt to shake his doubts. He looked at the fire with determination. He got into a starting stance. Then, he ran. He ran ,and jumped, right into the flames. For a second he held off the screams, but only for a second. He started his shouting soft at first, but it soon gave way to blood curdling screams of pure agony. He shouted and begged for someone to help him to put out the flames. Zacharious looked at the man in contempt. The disgust was then verbalized.

“Well if you had truly believed  in the gospel, you would have been fine.”

The man was still burning. He was now rolling around on the floor of the stage, but the flames wouldn't die out. He left behind trails of blood and black soot that stained the stage. The flames roared on. They kept burning him as if he were doused in gasoline. The man reached his hand towards Zacharious, but the pastor just walked away with his head hung low. The man in white screamed even harder. I bet he'd be crying if his tear ducts hadn't been signed into burnt flesh. 

I found it hard to look away. I was repulsed by the sight, but it was so captivating. No one in the room got up to help the man. Especially not the pastor. Was this really happening? I sat with my jaw open, just watching. I saw a man burn alive and no one did a thing. Am I to blame for his death? Then the pastor walked into the flames. I was shocked at first, but to my surprise he did not ignite. It's as if the flames were ignoring him.

“See people? It's not hard to trust God. He protects me the same way he protects each of you.”

Behind him, the man in white was no longer moving. He ceased rolling around and he ceased screaming. He had died right there on stage behind the pastor. The pastor stood in the flames for many moments seemingly unphased by the heat. He just kept preaching.  Eventually, the flames turned off and he did the rest of the sermon. After the sermon, people got up, conversated for a bit, and went home. It was a normal day for them. By this time, the body on stage was no longer ablaze. 

I didn't know how to react. I was afraid that Zacharious would want to see me, but he walked behind the stage curtain without another word. I was slightly relieved. I was  ready to leave. This whole ordeal made me very nauseous. I was uncomfortable with the people that attended this church. I felt sick to my stomach. I walked outside of the stuffy church to get some fresh air. I was bent over a railing regretting my decision to have breakfast. I thought to myself. 

“Next week I won't eat before coming.”

Part 3

It's been months now. I've been constantly coming back to the Bastion of Faith for the Sunday sermons. I forgot all about my log of events when I first started coming here. There have been events in the past week or two that made me realize I should be recording my experiences. This weekend was the most bizarre by far. It's hard to find a spot for me to pick back up. 

I was completely sold on the church. I hadn't been so excited to go to Sunday mass since before my father died. The pastor was more and more charming each week I returned. His miracles became more and more breathtaking. Life felt good. 

The day started out as normal as any other day. I had bought nice suits to wear to church now. I wore navy blue with a nice Paisley tie. I would skip breakfast at home and opted to get brunch with the pastor after church. 

When I got to the Bastion of Faith I saw some friends that I had made there getting coffee. We all sang and listened to the pastor preach from the Bible. It was a good sermon just like all the rest. However when he finished his sermon, the light grew dim. Zacharious spoke in a softer tone now.

“Well everyone we have a lil something going on today. We are going to exorcise a demon on stage for you all.”

By this point I have seen people flying, a man dying and once the pastor even brought a man back to life. Honestly his miracles were so numerous that I couldn't even begin to describe all of them. Needless to say, the crowd was captivated instantly. We had no idea what this entailed or who was getting exorcised. Every member of the audience perked up and gave their undevided attention to Zacharious. A member of the church worshiped the devil during his early years. Apparently, in college, David was into the occult for a short time. Witchery, magic and gem stones. Although I don't believe in that stuff I could tell that Zacharious took it very seriously. David was certain that the devil was still in his life. Satan was allegedly causing him to lose sleep and feel bad emotions. David had apparently been coming since around the same time I started attending and was moved by the pastor's sermons. 

I'll admit, this sounded ridiculous. Even after the stuff I had seen, this seemed like a fable. I believed that exorcisms were only done in movies. I was only able to suspend my disbelief because Zacharious was taking the situation so seriously. He had followed guidance from the Vatican and had multiple things set up in preparation. There was a circle of salt around a chair in the center of the stage. Zacharious had also brought a bag of supplies to aid in this endeavor.

The pastor had David sit in the chair in the middle of the stage. The room went quiet as Zacharious began. He opened up a very, very old looking book and began reciting. It must've been Latin or something because I couldn't understand what he was saying. Whatever language it was, it certainly wasn't English. For a while nothing happened as he read. I was starting to think I was right about all of this being a hoax until about three minutes into the exorcism. I could tell David was sweating. He seemed to be very uncomfortable as though he was about to vomit. There was a sense of unease that began to pervade the room. It felt like a dense fog had descended upon us. The cozy vibe of the church was gone.

All of a sudden David began to scream. Zacharious noticed, but did not stop reciting the old text. Two congregation members in professional church attire held David down to the chair. His scream subsided, but only because David was actively holding them back. Every so often a word from the pastor n would cause David to cry out in pain. 

The lights were already dim, but they became even dimmer when David screamed. The power fluctuated every time David writhed. Then all of a sudden David got up from the chair. He pushed the congregation members away with enough force that they didn't bother coming back. David was drenched in sweat now. He begged Zacharious to stop, but his plea fell on deaf ears. David began to run around the same circle like a caged animal looking for an escape. He seemed unable to leave. This filled me with more dread. 

David began to unbutton his shirt. This was confusing at first, until we saw it. David had claw marks forming on his chest and abdomen. His skin was deep red in these spots as if it was scar tissue. I swear I saw something underneath his skin crawl, but I told myself it was a trick of the mind.

Zacharious pulled a round jar from his bag on stage. David could instantly tell what it was. He put up his hands and screamed as the pastor doused the man in holy water. The power had been fluctuating a little before, but with this action, David's screaming had plunged the entire church into darkness. Not even the emergency lights were on. People gasped in fear. We could only see what was illuminated via the red and yellow stained glass. 

The microphone was no longer on, however we heard the pastor shout the name of our God at the man. Then, in a way I still cannot describe, the ambience in the room changed. It was silent in a way that filled the emptiness in the air. As if silence was a sound itself. It washed out all the other noises.

From where David was lying on the stage, he was illuminated with light from the window. His shadow was splayed on the floor of the stage. Some of the lights flickered back on which gave us a false sense of hope. Then, we saw it. The lights depicted something we wish had stayed in the shadows. A shadow had formed behind David's body. It crawled up the wall and became a towering presence. The shadow was inhuman. It was clear what this was, it was a demon. I wasn't able to see the creature itself, but I could vividly make out the shadow on the wall. Only one person in the room was able to see the demon. He saw the creature for all of its horror. 

The pastor looked scared. I had never seen that man falter in confidence until now. Seeing the look on Zacharious’ face filled me with even more dread than seeing the demon's shadow. I didn't feel safe anymore, I began to feel paranoid. What if there were more in the room? Something happened that snapped me out of my paranoid monologue. Zacharious shouted. I looked back up at the stage to see Zacharious suspended in the air. The scene before me was bathed in an ominous red glow. I could tell by the shadow, the demon had our pastor in his hand. 

Zacharious struggled for a moment, trying to fight the demon's strength. He grasped the air where the demon's arm would be. He latched onto it and squeezed. Zacharious shouted at the demon, but I couldn't hear what he said because simultaneously the demon let out a bassy cry that rattled the church. Instantaneously I saw the demon's shadow retreat in pain. His deformed body was still human enough to read the body language. It was in pain. The demon continued his squealing. It was almost like a down pitched pig squeal. That sound was disgusting.

The pastor picked up the book and continued to read. The demon let out more and more pitiful cries until his shadow ceased to exist. The power slowly returned and so did my sense of security. There was no longer an ominous feeling of dread in the air.

The pastor collapsed on stage and the crowd rushed to check on him. I remember seeing the blood. The demon's claw had pierced his skin and let loose a deep current of the pastor's blood. However, he was no longer bleeding. That man has enough power left to save himself from what would have been a fatal amount of blood loss. He was still breathing.

As for David, he seemed different now. He seemed frail in a way. I can't explain it, but that demon must have been very attached to him. It looked like the exorcism took a lot out of him. He was out of breath just sitting in a ball on the stage. We tried to comfort him, but it was no use. He was shell shocked. No one could get through to him until one man spoke. Zacharious had regained conciseness and sat up. 

He spoke with great effort.
“Hey Sonny, there's nothing to worry about. I got them out of you. I sent em back to hell. You're safe.”

Somehow he came across as confident as ever. And it worked. David was saved from the PTSD he was about to form. He hobbled over to the pastor and hugged him. They began to laugh out of pure excitement. The congregation cheered. It was sweet, but unfortunately, they were both covered in blood now.

One thing still remains in my mind to this day. The pastor didn't have a shadow.

# About me/my biases

I’m a Globalist working professional, I travel for both work and leisure. For work usually alone, for leisure usually with p2 or my parents. I like luxury, but I care much more about location and price performance. I am usually selecting hotels based on the following criteria in order:

1. Cleanliness (I’m a mild clean freak)
2. Location
3. Price
4. Globalist Benefits/Freebies
5. How nice it is

Rating system

A: I highly recommend this hotel or there’s something special

B: Would stay again, nothing special

C: It’s okay, could stay again, but value is mediocre or would consider other options

D: Would only stay again if I had no other choice

F: Would cancel the trip if this is my only option

# Hyatt Regency Casablanca

Rating: B

Price Paid: 9k points/night off peak + SUA

Room: Executive Suite

# Overview

Overall, this hotel was a solid choice for Casablanca. I went on this trip with my parents, and all three of us stayed in a 1 King Executive Suite (Bookable online with SUA!), where I slept on a rollaway. The rollaway was comfortable enough for a full sized adult, and the executive suite has a fully closing door between the bedroom and living room, which was comfortable for my parents and I. The suite also comes with a powder room, so I didn’t need to use their bathroom except to shower. The room had a dated finish, but seemed to be in good condition. To note, our room had a phenomenal view of the Hassan II Mosque.

# Food

Breakfast had a decent spread of western options with some Moroccan specialties such as fresh orange products and pomegranate, olives, and cold cuts. I had no problem eating here for three days. (I’m not an expert on food from this region, so take this with a grain of salt) We also received a generic fruit bowl in the room as a welcome gift.

# Location

As a tourist, Casablanca is a medium sized sprawling city, and the HR is central to many places. You’ll need to take taxis to many places in the city though.

# Price Commentary

At 9k points per night, I was very happy with the price, especially since SUAs can directly book the executive suite, which fits 3 adults easily.

# Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui

Rating: B

Price Paid: Cat 1-4 (This hotel is now a Cat 5)

Room: 1 King View

# Overview

I booked a standard king room, and was upgraded to a high floor room facing Victoria Harbor. The room has a modern finish, and is quite large by HK standards. The room was clean and well maintained.

# Food

This year I only stayed for one night, with an early morning flight. Upon informing the front desk that I had an early flight, they offered to prepare a breakfast box since I would be checking out before breakfast hours. The breakfast box had a decent spread of HK bakery style pastries, and we were offered Orange Juice and Coffee at checkout as well. This was a very nice gesture since we were leaving around 5:30am.



In past stays (Q1 2024), I’ve observed the breakfast spread in the club lounge to be good but nothing special, with an average spread of western and chinese breakfast options.

The evening cocktail hour had a decent spread of beer and wine, as well as light bites, but given the amount of great and cheap food around the hotel, I wouldn’t generally eat dinner in the club.

# Location

This hotel has an amazing location. It's within a 10 minute walk of Victoria Harbor, and steps away from the TST subway station. There’s tons of good food within a few minutes walk of the hotel, and the TST subway station is one of the most well connected.

# Price Commentary

This hotel has taken more of my FNCs than any other. At category 4, this was my go to hotel in HK, with its solid offering and phenomenal location. At category 5, maybe I will be motivated to finally try out the Centric, though the location seems somewhat worse.

# The Langbo Chengdu

Rating: A+

Price Paid: \~$100USD/night

Room: 1 King Suite

# Overview

Where to begin… this is a top 5 hotel experience in my life. I booked a one king room, and was upgraded proactively to a king suite. The room has a very modern and clean finish, with freebies in the minibar, and plenty of space. The hotel is situated on the high floors of a building, so the view from all rooms is spectacular. The suite in particular has a tub with a beautiful city view, and a spacious dual vanity with lots of counter space. Everything in the hotel felt very premium. Through the hotel, there is lots of panda themed art, which was a very fun touch, as Chengdu is the panda city. The only negative with the room, was that there is no door between the living room and bedroom, which would make it a bit less private if I were traveling with my family or friends.



The hotel also felt like it came with a ton of freebies, which I’m easily baited by. From face masks with turndown service, to travel sized mouthwash and a generous minibar with free snacks and drinks. None of these cost much money, but the hotel certainly didn’t feel like they were skimping. The service also felt very personal, with the housekeeping and front desk always knowing and greeting me by name.



One quick disclaimer, there is definitely a language barrier here. I speak very basic mandarin, and am mostly illiterate. There is very little english speaking staff here. I was able to get by, but I would expect any non-mandarin speakers to be spending a good amount of time on a translation app. I also hear amazing things about the Grand Hyatt Chengdu, which is a similarly nice hotel in a similar price range and location. I assume they would have better English support there. (Langbo was \~25USD cheaper for my dates)

# Food

Breakfast here was an absolute highlight. They have a rotating spread of traditional Chinese breakfast, including Cantonese, Sichuan, and Northern Chinese style breakfast every day, as well as a generous spread of western options. In particular, their dim sum is phenomenal. We stayed for four nights, and pretty much ate different things every day. They also have a big spread of fresh fruit and juice. This could be the best hotel breakfast I’ve had (though GH Macau and Ritz Shenzhen are close).



Afternoon tea was nothing special, with a decent spread of pastries and small bites. Teas were aromatic but nothing to write home about by Chinese standards. Unfortunately I never tried the evening cocktail hour, but that was offered for Globalists.

# Location

This hotel is conveniently located about a 8 minute walk from the nearest subway station, and a 10 minute walk from the city center IFS/Chunxi lu. It’s also directly across the (big) street from the iconic Chengdu Taikoo Li mall. On the other side of the hotel, there is a street with tons of cute local cafes and shops, as well as restaurants. While not directly on top of a subway station, the location is extremely central and convenient to go to most places.

# Price Commentary

It’s true that China has relatively lower prices than much of the world, but this is one of the only places where you can experience this level of luxury for this price. It’s a great deal.

# Hyatt Regency Metropolitan Chongqing

Rating: A

Price Paid: 5k points (Cat 1)

Room: 1 King High Floor

# Overview

We booked a king room, and were upgraded to a high floor king room. The room had a decent but not special view of the surrounding city. The room has a slightly dated Hyatt Regency finish, but was very well maintained and spotlessly clean. The room was also fairly large.

# Food

Breakfast was served in the restaurant and had a solid spread, with both Chinese and Western options. There were about 10 hot dishes each for chinese and western stations, with a good selection of fresh fruit. The food quality was great, but options were not as varied day to day, or unique to the region. I would generally describe this as a fairly standard offering at a HR/GH in China. I was able to eat here for 3 days without feeling like I was tired of the food, but the options might have gotten boring if I had stayed longer.

The Regency club offering had only a few small snacks and drinks, nothing special there.

# Location

This hotel was conveniently located just a two minute walk from jiefangbei, which is considered the center of the city. It is also within a 20 minute walk of all major downtown attractions, such as shibati and hongyadong. As with any location in Chongqing, any 15 minute walk might actually be a 15 minute hike up a staircase, so be careful to plan your routes carefully. The hotel was also about an 8 minute walk from both line 1 and line 2 subways, which were very convenient for further destinations.

# Price Commentary

At 5k points, this is an absolute steal

# UrCove Xi’an Huimin Street

Rating: B

Price Paid: $40USD (yes!! Really!!)

Room: 1 King with Window

# Overview

We booked a 1 king room, and got a modest upgrade to a 1 king room with a window. Some UrCove rooms don’t have windows. We were placed on a non-smoking floor, as requested, and had no issues paying with an American credit card. Check in was also smooth, and my reservation with the international hyatt website was integrated with no issues. The room was small, but otherwise had all the basic amenities. There was a small couch, plenty of outlets, and an acceptable shower and toilet room. The vanity was in the hallway of the room.



One very useful offering of UrCove hotels is free laundry machines (including free detergent). This was super useful during our trip. The laundry machines were clean and modern, and worked easily for free.



I wouldn’t expect much english support here, so bring your translator app if you decide to stay here.

# Food

Breakfast had a tasty but basic spread of Chinese breakfast. It was free for globalists, and we ate here every day.

# Location

The location of this hotel is great for first time tourists. It’s about a 7 minute walk away from the nearest subway station, and 10 minutes away from the bell tower and muslim food street. This part of town generally has much fewer hotel options for nice hotels, so you’ll likely need to choose something a little smaller if you want to stay in the old town.

# Price Commentary

The hotel is basic, but is clean and comfortable. For USD$40, it’s a great deal.

# Grand Hyatt Beijing

Rating: B+

Price Paid: 12k points/night (Category 3)

Room: 1 King Deluxe

# Overview

The “Deluxe” aka renovated rooms have super clean and modern finishes, but the rooms can be somewhat small. During all of my stays here, the rooms have been spotlessly clean. I’ve always booked the most basic 1 King/1 Twin rooms, and have always received an upgrade to a renovated room as a Globalist. As such, I’ve never stayed in the non-renovated rooms.

# Food

The breakfast is served in the club, with a generous spread of Western and Chinese breakfast. The menu changes slightly every day, and is tasty but nothing special. There are also made to order noodles, which are tasty.

The evening cocktail hour has a decent looking alcohol selection (I don’t drink so idk) and had about 6 hot chinese dishes. There was also a made to order noodle bar. The offering is pretty solid, but I didn’t eat here except one night since there is so much good food in the city.

# Location

The location is right on top of a mediocre mall, which has upscale brands and an okay selection of food. There are many large bubble tea chains in the mall, which I visited frequently. More notably, this hotel is located at Wangfujing, which is the main pedestrian shopping street in Beijing, and also a major subway station. Subway stations in Beijing are very far apart, so being on top of a station is super useful. This is also one of the only hotels that is located near the center of the city, rather than on one side or another. This is because the center of the city is a historical and political center, rather than being available for private development.

# Price Commentary

Beijing is an expensive city by Chinese standards, but at Category 3 I would consider this to be quite a good redemption. The location is great, and the hotel is clean and luxurious.

# Hyatt Centric Mountain View

Rating: C+

Price Paid: $200-$425/night

Room: 1 King

# Overview

This hotel is clean and modern with large rooms and a nice finish. It has a decent fitness center, and a pool that I’ve never seen anyone use. It’s mostly a business trip hotel. Stayed a few times for work, hence the range.

# Food

Breakfast is served in the restaurant. Globalists officially get to order one entree, one hot drink, and one cold drink. I once tried to order two entrees and got both for free. Breakfast quality is good, and I would eat here every day if I were here on leisure. There are about 6 decent looking entrees on the menu, so plenty to try.

# Location

The hotel is located near San Antonio Road. If you’re coming here, you probably have a specific reason to come here. Otherwise it’s a nice, comfortable, uninteresting bay area suburban hotel. There is a Mendocino Farms a 1 minute walk from the hotel, which is yummy and cheap by bay area standards. There are also a few other restaurants in the plaza that I haven’t tried. You’ll need a car in this area.

# Price Commentary

At $200, this is a decent hotel in the bay. It’s upscale, has a nice finish, and is very clean. Rates are frequently as high as $400+, and at that price I would look elsewhere.



# Hyatt Regency Santa Clara

Rating: C

Price Paid: $150-$375/night

Room: 1 King

# Overview

This hotel has large rooms with a dated finish. Globalist benefits are fairly generous, but the hotel can be pricey. This is a standard US Hyatt Regency conference hotel. I’ve stayed here a few times for work, hence the range.

# Food

Breakfast is served in the restaurant. The spread is an okay selection of western buffet foods that are typical of hyatt regency in the US. Globalists also received dinner vouchers for snacks at the bar. The bar food was fine, and this was a nice touch.

# Location

This hotel is located right by Santa Clara Convention Center as well as Levi’s Stadium. If you are going there, the location is great. If you are going anywhere else, the location is just fine, as long as you have a car. Avoid staying here when there are events in the above two venues, traffic can be terrible.

# Price Commentary

At $150, this is a decent hotel to stay. At $375, I generally would look elsewhere. Parking is also not free.

# Hyatt Place San Carlos

Rating: B+

Price Paid: $130-$215/night

Room: 1 King

# Overview

This hotel has the experience of a boilerplate modern Hyatt Place, but with some nice additional touches. The touches include a bar serving food at night, and a great gym. The rooms have the typical King bed + sofa bed setup, with a decent sized bathroom and room. The room was pretty clean. For a suburban hyatt place, the rooms are a bit on the small side.

# Food

Breakfast could be described as standard Hyatt Place offerings, with slight upgrades. The fresh fruit was very fresh, the offerings included 5 types of pastries, 2 types of bread, bagels, two types of sausage, and fresh fruit. Still a Hyatt Place breakfast, but like, slightly better?

The bar food was fine, but given most Hyatt places don’t have food outside of breakfast, it’s nice that it was there.

# Location

If you’re looking for a cheap place near SFO, it’s about a 15 minute drive away. Otherwise, I assume you have a specific reason for coming here. There’s a few restaurants and fast food establishments nearby, and the hotel is near the highway, but not so close as to get the noise.

# Price Commentary

For a bay area hotel, this Hyatt place has great prices. It’s nothing special, but it’s on the better end of Hyatt Place hotels

# Hyatt Regency Bellevue

Rating: A-

Price Paid: $180-300/night

Room: 1 King High Floor (Renovated)

# Overview

Booked a standard king room, got upgraded to a renovated high floor room. This hotel is a standard US HR convention hotel, and my go to on Seattle's east side for work trips. The renovated rooms have clean and modern HR finishes, with large rooms and bathrooms. The Globalist recognition and service is especially notable. Upon check in, the front desk apologized that there were no suites available, and proactively spelled out all of my benefits. In my room, there was a full stocked gift basket, including in season Washington apples and a mini charcuterie set, as well as a local bottle of wine. Housekeeping was also very detail oriented, doing a full cleaning of the room, and even spending the time to fold my clothes. (Something I actually don’t prefer, and I assume would never be done in US hotels.) This is my first time receiving what I feel to be an Asia level of service at a US hotel.

# Food

Breakfast is in the restaurant, where globalists are able to order an entree, a hot drink, and a cold drink. However, on occasions where I order an extra entree or a side, I’ve never been charged. The breakfast is tasty american brunch food, and the menu is large enough for a multi day stay.

# Location

The hotel is located in downtown Bellevue, near a bunch of restaurants and shopping. It’s as central as you get in Bellevue. If you are visiting the east side, it’s a great hotel. If you are visiting Seattle, I would recommend staying in Seattle to avoid daily bridge traffic. (HR Seattle would be my go to in seattle)

# Price Commentary

Price is pretty good for the experience. It should be noted that parking is expensive

# Hyatt House Seattle/Bellevue

Rating: C

Price Paid: $170-250/night

Room: 1 King

# Overview

This is a standard Hyatt house.

# Food

This is a standard Hyatt house breakfast

# Location

The hotel is located near I-90, which is fine, but not particularly convenient for anything other than driving east from Seattle. No restaurants nearby, you’ll have to drive at least 10-15 minutes to an area with many options.

# Price Commentary

It’s just a hyatt house. Location is mediocre, offering is just fine. My one problem is that in my experience, the Hyatt Regency is not much more expensive.

# Hyatt Regency Chicago

Rating: B+

Price Paid: Cat 1-4

Room: 1 King High Floor Riverview

# Overview

This is one of the better US Hyatt Regency locations. Booked a standard King, and was upgraded to a high floor riverview king. Upon check in, my family member and their p2 who was on a completely separate reservation from me was upgraded to a high floor riverview as well on the spot to “give us rooms close together.” He had 0 status. This was a very nice touch. The front desk also proactively told us all four of us could go to breakfast together and charge to my room, and the whole bill would be comped. However, they didn’t join us for breakfast, so I don’t know if this is actually the case.



The room was spacious, modern, and clean, and had a beautiful view of the Chicago river, extending out to the lake.

# Food

Breakfast was relatively standard for a US Hyatt Regency, with a breakfast buffet and made to order egg dishes. There was a good spread of hot food and fresh fruits, veggies, and cold cuts, as well as pastries.

Globalist benefits also came with an F&B credit (I think \~$15 but I don’t remember), which we used at the bar to get a late night snack.  A generous serving of chips and guac ran us basically the whole benefit.

# Location

The location of the Hyatt Regency is amazing. It’s right on the top end of the loop, and is convenient for both the Riverwalk and Michigan avenue, which are both about a 5 minute walk away. Wacker is also a useful street for ubering around, which we did since we had dinner reservations further out. The hotel is about a 30 minute walk to Soldier field, which we were seeing a concert at.

# Price Commentary

This is a great use of Cat 1-4 certs, since hotels in Chicago can be quite pricey in the summer months.

# Hyatt Centric Montreal

Rating: D+

Price Paid: 12-15K points/night (Cat 3, regular and peak rate)

Room: 1 King

# Overview

The interior of this hotel is in great condition, the rooms and clean and decor is nice. The rooms are on the small side for the location, but have all of the expected comforts. There is a rooftop pool which we checked out, which was incredibly small. One thing to note, I tried to apply an SUA, but found out this hotel does not accept SUA, and that they “don’t usually upgrade globalists.” I didn’t need a suite, so I didn’t press the issue further, but it should be noted this is one of the hotels opting themselves out of benefits as much as possible. I also requested 4pm check out at check in time, but was told I needed to talk to the front desk the day before “if I really needed it.” In general, it seemed like the hotel was trying their best not to honor globalist benefits whenever possible.

# Food

Upon check in, I was given daily breakfast vouchers and told not to lose them. The breakfast was a choice between a buffet, which more or less resembled a Hyatt Place buffet, or a made to order menu. In the end, the menu items were mediocre, and we ended up opting for the buffet every day, or going out to buy pastries. In general, breakfast was a miss.

# Location

The location of this hotel is just okay. It’s about a 15 minute walk to the main old town, and a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. The area around the hotel is also mostly empty, with lots of closed businesses. The only advantage is being near the river and old port. In general, the location felt mildly inconvenient, and for that reason I would probably choose a downtown hotel such as the Courtyard next time.

# Price Commentary

The cash prices are pretty high, though for a category 3 hotel, the redemption is acceptable. Overall, I would just prefer a better location.

# Thompson Madrid

Rating: A-

Price Paid: 25k points/Cat 1-7 (Cat 6)

Room: 1 King Deluxe?

# Overview

I booked a standard King room, and was informed at check in that I had been upgraded to a 1 King Balcony room. However, I arrived a bit early, and that room was not available. I was given the option to wait for the room, or to take a Standard King room which could be ready in 15 minutes. I opted for the standard room. During those 15 minutes, we sat down for a welcome drink in the lobby, and then were informed that we had a Deluxe room available for us. This room was clean and modern, with a spacious bathroom. In addition, for some reason the bed was hilariously large. Maybe a “Wyoming King?” I’ve never seen a bed so large. In addition, they gave some freebies such as a bottle of local olive oil, and some artsy coasters.

# Food

Breakfast is phenomenal and local. You are given a daily Spanish breakfast with the garlic tomato bread, cheese, iberian ham, seasonal fruit, jam, and pastry. In addition, you can order a savory entree, sweet, and hot and cold drink. This is a hilarious amount of food, that we struggled to finish even half of. The local breakfast was a huge treat, and we love that we felt immersed in local culture from the get go. All of the food was high quality, and there was enough to eat for a week without repeating much.

The welcome drink consisted of a selection of beer, wine, and cocktails, as well as two types of tortilla espanola. In addition, one of the nights had a celebration, where the hotel was giving a spanish alcoholic drink (I forgot what it was) for free to celebrate the holiday season.

# Location

The hotel’s location is phenomenal. It’s located just a 3 minute walk from Sol, 4 minutes from Gran Via, 15 minutes from the Prado and Retiro Park, and 18 minutes from the royal palace. There are also multiple metro stations within a 5 minute walk. You’re truly in the heart of everything. 

# Price Commentary

The cash prices are pretty high (450 euro during our stay) so we opted to use points and a Cat 1-7 cert. This is normally out of my budget, but this hotel’s location and experience are both phenomenal. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if I had the opportunity of a redemption.

Location from airport 50 minutes via private transfer. 1h30 via included shuttle. We took private shuttle via Canada transfer on our way there and included shuttle on our way back.

Resort: I previously posted here about our initial review regarding the resort. We booked a 7 days Family Concierge package through Air Canada Vacations. Was the Family Concierge worth it? We’re undecided, aside from 2 restaurants that we could eat at exclusively for FC package and a concierge to book our dinner a la cart meals we didn’t really utilize the extra FC perks. Our family friend who didn’t book the FC package was able to get dinner reservations easily as well at the “Culinary Experience” booth to get all their a la cart reservations and our kids didn’t swim at the FC exclusive pool as the “fun” (aqua zone and pirate ship) pools are available for everyone to use.

Food: Good/Very Good: we would eat breakfast at the buffet which had good choices for adults in kids. They had breakfast omelette bar, various Mexican breakfast options, traditional breakfast options (eggs/cereals/breads/cold cuts/cheeses/etc. they also had a kids section (eggs/hot dogs/ sandwiches/tater tots/bacon/etc.

Lunch: we would eat at the buffet again lots of options for adults and kids, they always had a pizza station with pizza being made fresh on site, a pasta bar, grilled meat and other mexican food available. We also ate at Celsius/Lunch Box where they would have a more fast food/grill vibe (hot dogs/burgers/nachos/chicken wings/sandwiches/fries etc) and it’s by the kids pirate ship pool.

Dinner: we ate at all the available restaurants in the family side and Lemon Fish on the adult side and we all enjoyed our dinner meals. We thoroughly enjoyed the Italian restaurant (Capellas) and the taco restaurant (Blue Agave) the best.

Beach: the beach was good, lots of sand and space. Some parts a few feet past shore was rocky so be extra careful. There’s a tiny bit of seaweed and a little bit of random garbage (plastic bottle caps) that washed ashore. But overall, the beach was nice, the public beach located both to the left Playa Esmeralda and right Playa 88 is also nice.

Room: Average- the resort was showing its age with the decor, some minor paint chips, non-smart TV, and no coffee maker in room.

Service: Amazing. We always felt looked after, the staff always asked if we needed anything, there’s no pushy sales people trying to convince you to sign up for some sort of time share or rewards program. Our rooms were always made daily and mini bar/water replenished daily. The servers at the beach were attentive and would frequently walk past to ask if we needed more drinks.

Kids activity: Very good. They have a Kidsdom children first come first serve drop off for kids 1-4 years old and 5-10 years old from 9am-9pm and they communicate via WhatsApp if they need you for anything. They have a full days worth of activities for them.

Gym: the gym was good sometimes full of people. There are 2 sections weight and cardio section and a spin room/ open floor section. 

Café: there are 2 24h Nespresso Cafes one at family side and 1 at the adult side. They serve coffees/pasties/sandwiches.

Cleanliness: the resort was clean, there’s some instance at peak times where the restrooms at common places were getting a little dirty but it was cleaned shortly after.

Cons: as previously stated, the age of the resort really does show with the aesthetic of the building/upholstery of seats at common areas but overall it wasn’t that bad.

Lounge activities: Pool table and foosball table were both in rough conditions. There’s a “secret” game room accessible via a hidden door by the main lounge foosball table but it’s for kids ages 11 and up. From what I saw inside they had 2 arcades/ a couple of PS5s and Xbox available.

Beach/pool seating: reserve your spots early by placing towels to ensure that you have prime spots at the beach/pool. The towel services opens at 9am, we usually place towels on the beach chairs/pool chairs depending where we plan to go that day at 9am and we would come back at around noon after we pick up the kids from Kidsdom.

Entertainment: Family side nightly shows were mediocre. It’s definitely geared towards children, we watched a magic show, circus show, neon light show, lion king in Spanish, and neon animal show. Entertainment value to our children high, value to adults low..on the plus side they have snack and drinks section inside the theatre to help pass time while the kids stare at neon animals dancing on stage haha.

Overall, we would go back to Paradisus Playa del Carmen again, it was worth our money, the food was good and the kids had lots of fun memories. We previously stayed at Dreams Jade and Dreams Vista previously and the food/drinks/kids enjoyment were all better at Paradisus. ",1,1765862371.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

All our interactions have been friendly and mostly about academics, but there’s a good comfort level between us. I’m confused whether she just trusts me as a friend or if there could be something more.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pntq59,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pntq59/my_bosses_arent_just_insufferable_theyre_not/,"My bosses aren't just insufferable: they’re not human. I have to kill them, if such a thing is even possible. [Part 1]","Before you contact the police, you need to know that my job isn’t normal. I never applied for it. I can’t tell anyone about it. And if I try to quit, my bosses will kill me. So I’ve decided to beat them at their own game. While reading this story, you might find my bosses likable. Funny. Charming, as those old bastards would say. But don't let them fool you. Believe me, the world will be much better off without them. 

I guess I should begin with how I became the unfortunate hero of this story. It all started, as so many terrible things do, with a Tinder date.

I’ve never been a good-looking guy. I’m well aware that self-deprecation is somewhat expected for this website, but it’s true. The only person who ever called me handsome is my Nana. My single attractive trait is that I’m taller than average. But that’s balanced out my physique, which could best be described as “a scarecrow on Ozempic.” Worst of all, my vision is so bad that I need Coke-bottle glasses in order to see more than a foot away.

After I moved to Pittsburgh for college, I went my entire freshman year without attempting to date anyone. Some of my friends, concerned for my wellbeing, convinced me to sign up for Tinder. I was unsure of it, at first. I thought Tinder was a site for hookups, and I’m more of a romantic. But since my friends insisted that this was the path to love, I relented. The first few dates I went on were fine- not great, but not disastrous enough to post to Reddit. I was about to give up when I matched with Daisy.

I was shocked that she swiped right on me at all. Daisy was very pretty- in other words, way out of my league. Second of all, when she messaged me, she was super chatty and enthusiastic. She was eighteen, grew up in London, and loved reading and going to museums and concerts. She was super excited to meet me and made this clear with multiple exclamation points and emojis. Though I was almost certain she was a catfish, I couldn’t pass up a chance to go on a date.

We ate dinner at a restaurant near campus. I was shocked to find out that Daisy was even more beautiful in person. She had a heart-shaped face with huge, ice-blue eyes. She was short, but had the sort of hourglass figure rarely seen outside of Hollywood. She had put her curly, light blonde hair in a high ponytail and wore a baby blue sundress. The only unattractive thing about her was that she was really pale- her skin was literally the color of milk. It was like she’d never gone outside in her life.

When she first saw me I braced for her disappointed reaction, but there was none. Her face broke out into a massive smile, like I was the most handsome guy she’d even seen. She spoke with a British accent that made her sound posh, like a character from *Pride and Prejudice.* Throughout dinner, she talked constantly, asking about where I’m from, what I was studying, my hobbies. She seemed genuinely interested in me, more so than any other girl I’d ever talked to. I was so excited that I failed to notice she was learning way more about me than I was about her.

After she generously offered to pay for both our meals (good thing, too, because she ate twice as much as I did), she offered to take me back to her place. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised- I did meet her on Tinder, after all- but in my experience, girls like Daisy were rarely so forward. Still, I jumped at the opportunity. At that point, I was putty in her hands.

Our Uber took us to a part of the city known as Squirrel Hill. It’s a well-kept neighborhood with nice houses and manicured lawns. Some of those houses are huge- more like mansions. I always assumed they were bed and breakfasts or luxury apartments. So you could imagine my surprise when the Uber pulled up to one of the biggest houses there. It was made entirely of white stone, with massive columns and a fountain in the front driveway. Half the facade was covered in ivy, but the rest of the property was immaculate.

Daisy got out and stood on the driveway, staring at the night sky. The usual Pittsburgh clouds had dispersed, and a full moon glared down at her like a gigantic spotlight. “What a beautiful moon,” she said, maybe just to herself.

I was still gawking at the house. “You’re… renting a room here?”

Daisy began moving up the drive. “No,” she said, still smiling, “This is my entire house.”

Jesus. Pretty, nice, and filthy rich? There had to be a catch. But Daisy had already disappeared through the front door, and I found myself following behind like a lovesick puppy.

The inside of the house was just as fancy as the outside. Victorian-style furniture, shining hardwood floors, Renaissance paintings. We passed by a room with the door slightly ajar, and I glimpsed a library with bookshelves up to the ceiling.

She led me not into her bedroom, but her “parlor.” I guess that’s rich-British-people-talk for “fancy living room.” It was just as exquisitely decorated as the rest of the house. I sank down on the tiny sofa, awkwardly trying to arrange my long legs, not really sure of what to do. Fortunately, or as I would soon learn, unfortunately, Daisy made the first move.

Daisy grabbed my hand. Her hand was freezing, and between that and how pale it was, I was hit with the sensation that I was holding hands with a corpse. But that was ridiculous. Maybe she just had poor circulation. 

She had never stopped smiling. Her teeth were tiny, perfectly straight and white. “I’m so glad you’re here, Elliot.”

“So am I,” I replied stupidly.

She moved closer to me, so that her shoulder was right against mine. Even through her dress and my button-down shirt, her skin was ice cold. “You’re a pretty good-looking fellow,” she was saying. 

“You’re joking,” I chuckled. 

“I’m not.” She used a slender finger to tilt my head her way. “I don’t have much experience with American boys. I didn’t realize they could be so-” she stopped, her blue eyes going vacant for a split second- “warm.”

“You’re so cold,” I mumbled.

I think she was saying, “Help me change that,” but at that point, her lips were already against mine.

In short, we started making out. I’ll spare you the details, except the most essential: we started on the tiny sofa, and wound up with my back against the wall opposite the door. At some point, I lost my glasses. I was so… um, *preoccupied…* that when I felt Daisy pulling down my collar and sinking her teeth into my neck, I thought she was just getting kinky.

But Daisy’s nibbles turned into bites, and her bites started to hurt. Not in a sexy way- it felt more like she had taken a scalpel to the skin below my jaw. *Shit. Did we agree on a safe word?* I tried to tell her to stop, but something red shot across my vision. Daisy shrieked as it splattered across her face. Blood. My blood. I held a hand to my neck and felt the blood shooting out like from a fountain, in time with each of my heartbeats. Some of the spurts made it halfway across the room.

With each spurt of blood I felt weaker. My already blurry vision was becoming downright foggy. I tried to speak, but the sound that came out was a mix between a groan and a gurgle. I tried to move, but wound up falling backwards against the wall and slumping to the floor. Daisy was speaking quickly, in the breathy, high-pitched voice that I found so cute just a few minutes ago. She looked panicked, but wasn’t making an effort to stop the bleeding or call 911. Her big blue eyes had gone enormous with fear. Like the song… *Her hair is Harlow gold… Her lips sweet surprise… Her hands are never cold..* Not this girl! I tried to laugh, but only heard myself make gurgling sounds.

A man appeared in the room. And I do mean appeared: the door never opened, he just materialized from under the door frame, surrounded by mist. His entire figure was blurry, but he seemed tall and athletic-looking. “Daisy!” he bellowed, in a similar accent, “What have you done?”

Daisy flew over to where the man was standing. I mean, literally *flew*: I saw her feet leave the floor in front of me. She glided towards him and continued floating in the air, so she could be at his eye level. 

“I’m so sorry, Lord Cyrus,” she was saying, “Everything was going so well! It was just supposed to be a regular feeding. I don’t know what happened!” She sounded genuinely upset.

“You’ve missed the jugular and bitten his carotid artery. 200 years of this, and you still can’t tell the difference. Now you’ve gotten blood all over the furniture. And your dress is ruined- I bought that for you a fortnight ago!”

*Fortnight?* Was this guy a *Bridgerton* character?

At this point I was lying on the floor, in a puddle of my own blood. The blood was still shooting out, but weaker. I took in the sights around me. There was a massive potted ficus on my left. An elaborately carved coffee table to my right. The wallpaper was cream in color, with a small but exquisite floral pattern. Even the ceiling was carved with a design, although at that point I could barely see it. I was about to experience one of the most embarrassing deaths imaginable, but at least I’d die someplace nice. It was a beautiful room to die in.

Daisy began to whimper. The man sighed. “I suppose it’s alright. Anyone can make mistakes. We’ll just throw him in the incinerator and start cleaning up.”

Although I was dying, the mention of an incinerator sent a wave of panic through me. I tried to scream but only gurgled and retched up some more blood. 

Daisy and the man stopped talking and turned to look at me. “My God…” the man said, “He’s still *alive?*”

He walked over and bent down to look at me, Daisy following close behind. I couldn’t make out his face, but his tone was even, analytical. “He *is* alive. Barely. I should snap the poor bastard’s neck and put him out of his misery.” I tried to protest, but only managed a moan and a wiggle.

“No!” shrieked Daisy. “This is a sign! He’s not like other mortals. He’s special. Can we keep him, Lord Cyrus? Please, please, please?” She was bobbing up and down in the air.

“And do *what* with him, exactly?”

“He could be my familiar! I haven’t had a familiar in so long! Can I please have him?”

*What the fuck is a familiar?* Before I could hear any more, everything went black.

I woke up to fluorescent lights and the sound of a beeping monitor. The metallic taste of blood still hung in my acrid mouth. Looking around, I realized I was in a hospital bed. There was a large bandage on my neck, right where Daisy had bitten me. Someone came up to me and handed me my glasses. Once I put them on, I realized, to my horror, who the person was.

“Good afternoon,” said Lord Cyrus. “Mr. Grant, is it?”

He came around and sat on the edge of my bed. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with thick black hair and the most vivid green eyes I had even seen. He looked to be in his early thirties. His skin was bronze, with a washed-out, almost grayish undertone that made him look somewhat sickly. He wore a suit that probably cost more than my tuition. Like Daisy, he was good-looking, but in a different way. Older, more worldly, more dangerous. While Daisy sparkled, Lord Cyrus smoldered.

Daisy, meanwhile, was hovering near the ceiling, reading a copy of *Sharp Objects*. When she saw I was awake, she dropped the book onto a chair and perched on my footboard like a gargoyle.

“Umm…” I mumbled, still slightly groggy, “Just call me... Elliot is fine.”

“You’re quite the survivor, aren’t you?” said Lord Cyrus, “You really ought to have bled out in the parlor. I wanted to snap your neck and be done with it, but Daisy took a liking to you.”

Daisy’s smile grew eerily wide. I noticed that her canine teeth were long and sharp. They didn’t look like that before. 

Lord Cyrus continued, “I’ve taken the liberty of paying your hospital bill.”

“Gee… thanks.” What could I say when his little friend put me in the hospital to begin with? “How did you explain what happened to my neck?”

He said matter-of-factly, “You and Daisy were being… intimate, when you fell against the wall and pierced your neck with a protruding nail.”

“What?” I exclaimed, “That’s the best you come up with?” In addition to trying to kill me, these two probably turned me into the laughingstock of the Pittsburgh medical system.

He shrugged. “The point is, Elliot, we kept you alive for a specific purpose. Daisy-”

She interjected, “I want you to become my familiar!”

“A familiar,” Lord Cyrus explained, “is a bit like a personal assistant. You will serve as Daisy’s companion, chaperone, and valet.” He must have seen the horrified expression on my face, because he added, “You will be paid, of course. We don’t believe in slave labor.”

Maybe it was the usual hospital chill, but I started trembling. “For how long?”

“As long as Daisy wants.”

“And if I refuse?” I asked, though I already suspected the answer.

“Daisy tears open your stitches and finishes her meal, and we make it look like an accident.”

Daisy, still perched on the footboard, made her blue eyes go huge and wide, pleading with me. Puppy-dog eyes, like my mom would say. Her canine teeth were normal now. I guess she could grow and retract her teeth at will, like a cat’s claws. She looked adorable, like the innocent, happy girl I found the restaurant. Who could guess this was the face of a monster?

My trembling turned to shaking. The wound on my neck throbbed with pain, as if anticipating what Daisy could do. The horrible things these two could do to me… I hated them, for pretending they were giving me a choice, for feigning generosity. This wasn’t a job offer so much as a deal with the devil. Those always ended the same: another soul dragged to the bottom of Hell.

Of course I said yes. What other choice did I have? 

“One more thing,” I added. “*What* are you two?”

“Why, Elliot,” Daisy replied. Her fangs grew back, and when Lord Cyrus smiled, I could see he had a pair of his own. “What do you think?”

I've been with my boyfriend (31) for about a year now . We met on a very popular gaming platform where I had a lot of friends and it was a way for me to socialize without going out as much because of my anxiety and lack of real life friends.. 

As soon as we started seeing eachother romantically he started demanding I cut off any male friends. Even if I've known them for years. He would join a chat room I'd be in and just stare at me without saying anything if I was speaking to any men. 

Then even started asking I don't hangout with certain female friends because they might be a "" bad influence"" on me . Then he had me get off the gaming platform all together. I bought the software on my own for my birthday and was devastated. But I really liked him so I complied. 

Then shit hit the fan. A little context i work in a warehouse. For months I had been being harassed by a male coworker let's call him Ned. Ned would constantly ask me out to get coffee or to go out drinking with him and i would politely decline. Then he started spreading rumors that we had slept together and just being straight nasty so I finally went to HR. He tried to save his own skin painting this picture that I am flirty and promiscuous and I lead him on . I had kept all of our text messages of me denying him every single time so that went out the window. As a last ditch effort he tried to tell HR that I give hand jobs to all the male employees in the parking lot. 

When I had told my boyfriend about this he immediately sided with Ned and said and i quote "" Maybe you shouldn't jerk men off in parking lots"". I immediately blocked him and cut off all ties and should've kept it that way but he begged for forgiveness and i gave in. 

He doesn't trust me when it comes to anything. He has all my passwords and has to know what I am doing at all times. He has me take pictures of what I am doing to see if I am telling the truth. I told him I was grocery shopping and he had me send a picture of my groceries because he didn't believe me.

I have constant anxiety that someone will message me because he has a whole freakout and interrogates me . I haven't even scratched the surface of the shit this man has put me through. 

But i'm starting to panic. I'm starting to forget things that people tell me. I'm starting to forget when he insults me or belittles me like there is something seriously wrong with me. I am so angry and sad lately and i feel like i cant get away.  I don't know why I attract controlling men . I have no one aside from him and my mom . I snap on him randomly now. Sometimes I hope he will get sick and just leave me. I have broken up with him so many times and I keep letting him back in like what is actually wrong with me.   Am I overreacting?

 I have a crush on a girl in my class who is very kind and humble. She’s a topper, while I’m an average student.

We’ve known each other for about 2 years and have done several group projects together. Most of the time, she has asked me to be her project teammate. In class, I’m pretty much the only boy she talks to in our class, and she also texts me for study-related doubts or small problems.

All our interactions have been friendly and mostly about academics, but there’s a good comfort level between us. I’m confused whether she just trusts me as a friend or if there could be something more.

Our end-sem exams finished two days ago, and I’m thinking of asking her out for a casual coffee just to talk normally, without study topics.

Does this seem like a good idea? And how can I ask her for cofee at nescafe without making things awkward if she doesn’t feel the same?",12,1765861968.0,twenties,39,1.0,False

Last week, my little brother (11 m) got really sick. He already went to patient first and had gotten medication but my mom still didn't hear back on what it was. It was just a fever, and he threw up so last Friday my mom took him again after lunch. When she got back it was like 7pm, I (17 f) said hi from my room and stayed in bed. I didn't really feel like getting up because it was cold and I wanted to stay under the covers with my heating pad. 15 min later my mom comes down stairs and starts going on about, ""You didn't even come up to help me or ask how your brother is doing"" I got up and went over to where she was and I was like ""oh yeah how is he?"".  She went on about how I don't care, how I should just stay in my room and she's never letting me go out with friends again because after school I went out to get coffee and go to target. I came home at 4pm mind you. She was yelling in my face and said ""stay in your room"" so I was like ""fine I will stay in my room"". She also said something about how she had groceries and I didn't help her, but usually she calls me from the driveway to come out and help her so I didn't even know. Also it was literally just one box of stuff. 2 days later my older brother (22) comes in my room at like 11pm saying ""What did you do to my mom!"" As if I committed some unspeakable crime. I said ""literally nothing, why did she complain to you"" he said no that she told him about it 2 nights prior but hes only now had time to talk to me. I tried explaining my side but he wasn't listening. And also, if she needed help or just wanted me upstairs all she had to do was ask and I would've. But she started yelling in my face about how ""you don't care and your insensitive"". He then went on to say how Im horrible, I don't care about them, I don't participate in ""family things"". That being hanging out with them in the living room 24/7. I repeated how I literally did nothing bad at all and he just said ""yeah that's the issue you did nothing. You don't care about your little brother, I called from work to ask how he's doing."" He seems to forget how ALL OF LAST WEEK I kept asking how he's feeling and trying to get him to eat. I even told my mom to take him to the doctor again. My older brother literally just wasn't hearing me out, and kept trying to villainize me so I told him to gtfo of my room and leave me alone. After he left, I texted him saying to not come into my room and try to villainize me over bs from 2 days ago, and if they want me to participate in the ""family"" then maybe they should stop yelling at me all the time. Earlier today, I'm making tea and he comes up to me and says ""I'm upset with you, I got so upset I unfollowed you on instagram."" Like okay..? Then he said ""yeah I even blocked your number"". I thought he was lying, but he actually blocked my number. This grown man blocked his little sister and unfollowed her bc I told him to get out my room after he was trying to make me feel like a piece of crap the whole time. He started to laugh in my face and saying he wants an apology. I refused, said I didn't do anything that horrible, and he needs to stop acting like hes the golden child when he doesn't even buy my mom a birthday gift while I'm the only one in the house who has. I still don't think I did anything THAT bad to warrant getting blocked and yelled at and called horrible and uncaring. ",2,1765861315.0,AITAH,2,0.75,False

The posts state: “WE RIOT. WOG/MIDDLE EASTERN BASHING DAY. SATURDAY 27TH DECEMBER 2025.

“SPREAD THE WORD AUSTRALIA! STAND THE F**K UP.”

In a statement, NSW Police said they are aware of the situation.

Tara Nicholls, who owns Cronulla jewellery store Florence by the Ocean, said she was shocked by the circulating post.

She said she feared the recent 20-year anniversary of the Cronulla riots had given people the “idea” to run a similar event.

“It’s absolutely horrible. It is shocking,” she told news.com.au.

“That’s not what Cronulla is about.”

Manny, who owns South Beach Seafood Company in Cronulla, which has been around for 33 years, said the event and the circulating post were “not good”.

However, he said he felt police were already on top of the situation.

“I don’t think what happened in 2005 will ever happen again here. I’ve got confidence in it,” he said.

“It’s a bit different now, I think. The world’s different.”

Another Cronulla resident of Mediterranean descent said seeing the local response to the attack from people he knew and considers friends had been “really upsetting”.

“I was sent it by a friend in a group chat, and so was my girlfriend. It was also shared in my family group chat,” he said.

“I’ll be away that day, so I won’t be around to witness whatever reaction follows, but I’m certain there will be people who take it seriously.

“What’s been most disturbing today is the way some people are thinking and speaking. These are people I’ve grown up with, people who know me, know my family, and know my background.

“Yet they’ve openly expressed violent, bigoted, and racist sentiments toward so-called “westies” and “wogs”.

The resident said coming from an immigrant European family, with the other half of my family also being immigrants and labelled as “westies”, has been “deeply confronting”.

“These labels aren’t abstract. They refer to real people, families, and communities. The level of uneducated, irrational hatred being directed at entire groups simply does not make sense.

“What’s been most upsetting is realising that this kind of indiscriminate hostility has no clear target. Looking different to an Anglo-Saxon Australian suddenly feels like enough.

The resident said the response has made him reflect on things as basic as leaving his home to get a coffee and feeling unsettled about how that might be perceived.

“This isn’t frustration or criticism, it’s hateful, bigoted, racist rage, and it’s confronting to see how normalised it still is.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Maybe you are partly right. But no one will inform you about the 'actual curriculum', which will not appear on any timetable.

The actual learnings

Thinking on your feet: You may be called on in the classroom without notice. No matter whether or not you have read the reading, the comments you make must sound knowledgeable. Cold-calling is big these days!!!

juggling with the clock. One minute you're preparing to deliver the group presentation, then you'll be working on that statistics problem, and then you better be wrapping up that marketing simulation, which is due in 45 minutes. Also, preparing reports for the simulation takes too long.

“Data doesn’t lie, but it sure can confuse: Excel formulas, pivot tables, and dashboards are all fun and games… until your spreadsheet crashes at 3:00 am.”

Feedback is your best friendlessons from professors, from classmates, from the recruiter—constructive, negative, or just very blunt—that you learn to take and use.

Group work is a mirror, and you get to witness the best and worst of everyone, including yourself. Group work teaches you to be patient, how to handle conflict, and how to listen. There will be many group projects. Just be ready.

Friendships emerge in late-night cups of coffee and in panic. After all, there is no better way to form a relationship than in moments of presentation anxiety, Maggi noodles, and 2 AM

Leadership speaks little: It’s not always the loudest voice in the room. Sometimes it is making sure every voice is being heard.

“And yes, you will still learn the strategy frameworks and marketing funnels and financial models.

But the biggest takeaways?”

Resilience.

Being clear under pressure.

The strength of people.

And the grit to keep moving even when you don’t know what the next step is.

An MBA doesn’t only prepare one for a career in business.

It teaches you how to live.

“The chaos, the learning curves, the people; you grow through it all,”

“Here’s to the journey so far, and all that’s still to come.” “I also hope you guys will share yours as well once you are enrolled into your dream B schools.”

I previously worked within a Kroger Starbucks, and was familiar with having a district manager/Starbucks updates given directly to us, as well as promotional items like cups or coffees. The hospital does not do merchandise or ground coffee/whole bean bags for purchase, which I expected. But, the supervisor insists on personlizing the recipes based on his own tastes. He refuses to dilute the refresher concentrates and pours the 8x concentrate directly into the shaker. He also does 6 pumps of brown sugar for a venti BSO instead of the 3 I was taught, and when a BSO is ordered with cold foam, he pours out half of the espresso from the shaker to make room for the cold foam. Is he allowed to do this?? It seems like a health concern, especially considering that my customers are unaware that they're getting more sugar than what's on the Starbucks recipe nutrition guides. My supervisor customized these recipes because he feels that they don't taste sweet enough (idk how he isn't diabetic tbh). I did inform his boss but they haven't really spoken to him yet. I know we have a Starbucks representative, but I'm worried about getting in trouble for going over the heads of my bosses. This has to be against the rules though, right??

Day one of our plant festival. Mr. Shriner hired some teenager to watch the shop this weekend so I could do the kettle corn stand. However, I feel like it makes more sense to hire the kid for the kettle corn and leave me to my air conditioned shop. Safe to say, not into it but whatever. 

So, I dressed myself in as much linen as possible, gave Demeter some extra kibble and headed out the door early to set up. Because Mr. Shriner is a traditionalist, I had to load 2 huge copper kettles into the truck of my car and hope my strap job stopped them from bouncing out. When I pulled in, Markus and Cami were just starting to unpack their car as well so we chatted for a moment. 

Cami makes the crystal sun catchers remember? Her table is always some form of divination, but she switches it up every year. This year, she went with palm reading and pendulums.

I don’t think I’ve introduced you to Markus yet. He’s a younger guy, works at the elementary school as the gym teacher. He does the muscle work for the fair. Setting up tables and booths, moving stock, all the things you’d expect from a young buff meathead. I say that with love of course, but he’s closer to being a camp counselor kind of man then your stereotypical jarhead gym teacher. 

I helped Cami pop up her booth while Markus McMuscles moved the kettles to my stall for me. By the time he came back, Cami was set up, and Markus and I were all soaked in sweat. I said my goodbyes and tootled off to finish unpacking. 

After several trips to the car, I got everything to my booth, started to put it away, heat up my kettles all the fun stuff.. So I get the gas going and turn around to set out my kernels and my flavors, and I managed to only grab what I needed for caramel, not Jed Mei’s snow. I still don’t have a clue where that comes from or what flavor it is. Maybe it’s white like snow?  If we would have stuck with caramel and cinnamon-caramel, this wouldn’t be an issue but I digress. So day one is only gonna be caramel flavored. 

Things went really well for a few hours. The mayor did her speech to open the festival, and the rides all started in a jarring scream of calliope and neon lights. Kids came up with their pocket money or their parents credit cards and walked away with bags of kettlecorn as big as they are. I seen some happy customers leave Cami’s tent, and even Rooter showed up for a few minutes. He stopped in and bought a bag to take to Sara and Loretta before heading to the cemetery. 

Then things went weird. *oooOOOooo*. Realistically, I think it was heat stroke. It’s August. 

So the festival is set up in the center of town, in a large paved plaza. In the middle of the plaza is a huge statue that’s been here since the town was founded. Not of the founder, like the one in the simpsons’ mind you. It’s a carving of a huge tree with the front of it missing. Kinda like a doorway you know? There’s a figure standing in that doorway, wearing long robes covered in leaves and a mask that looks kinda like this little tree guys from legend of Zelda, with a little branch kicking off the side and everything. 

Karen and her husband were selling her oils across the plaza from me. I could see their table, and they didn’t have a gazebo or anything to keep the sun off of them. Her husband has been steadily sipping tall boys all morning, so he was at the very least buzzed. Karen was putting drops of some oil in every time he looked away from a new can. What was she putting in their coffee last week? Jamsonweed for mental clarity or something? I don’t think that’s going to negate the whole pounding beer all morning but whatever. 

By noon, he had finished a six pack, and I didn’t see him drink anything else. So Ralph is sitting there, mildly buzzed and listening to his wife chatter when his eyes begin to bulge out of his head. He starts to mumble, trying to get his wife’s attention as he pushes back in his camping chair. Karen; in the midst of an ever important sale, ignores him until he goes “ass over teacups” as my mom says. Ralph flipped backwards in his chair, throwing his beer away from him in the process. He lands flat on his back, and keeps trying to push himself away, pointing at something in front of the table. Karen finally gives him attention, and tries to help him off the ground but he kept pushing her away, trying to crawl away until he backed himself against a tree. A few people rushed over to him, so my view was blocked but I could hear him start screaming. Something about redemption and reclamation of what is owed. Someone called an ambulance as soon as he started to vomit a black gooey stuff and started seizing. They rolled him on his side, and someone held Karen out of the way. Bless her, she was so scared. 

It didn’t take long for the ambulance arrive thankfully, and they were both loaded in and taken away before he got worse. He hadn’t drank or ate anything but beer for hours, sitting in the hot August sun, so it’s not terribly surprising he got so sick so quick. I hope he feels better soon though.

 Cami and I packed up Karen’s table for her and put it in her car. I scribbled out a note saying I had her keys and her purse and to call me when she’s ready for them, but if I don’t hear back tomorrow I’ll give a call. 

The rest of the day went well beyond a weird vibe hanging in the air. I sold out on corn about an hour before anticipated, so I took a stroll around the other booths before I packed up. Ended up buying a new toy for Demeter and a cute cigar band ring for myself. It looks kind of like Rooter’s now that I look at it.  But the carving is an eye with a lil flame in it and the stone is a transparent orange instead of a deep green tree. It almost glows, isn’t that neat? 

**Sunday, August 3rd, 2:39 am** 

Is heat stroke contagious? Can heat stroke cause mass hysteria? Today was fucking nuts. I don’t know what happened but I lost my mind again. A lot of us did. 

So I got up, got ready and left at the same time as yesterday, but I remembered Mr. Mei’s special blend this time. I even grabbed an extra bag of corn since I sold out early yesterday. Karen’s booth is gone when I arrived and someone else took her spot selling custom tumblers and those 3D printed dragons. Her car was gone too, but I still had her keys so she must have parked in a bad spot and got towed. I heard her husband was still hospitalized, so she’s probably not too concerned yet. 

So, rinse and repeat of the process yesterday. I start to heat the kettle, unpack my supplies, say hi to Cami (who brought me a saffron latte. I could kiss that woman) and Markus, and start popping corn. I did up a batch of caramel first and bagged that, hanging it on the hooks by the window. Then I popped open the cartons of Jeb Mei’s snow and my entire field of vision is covered in this tacky, off white powder that smells like… composting plants is the closest I can get you. It was absolutely disgusting and stuck to everything it touched. So I get that batch going and try to wipe everything clean but the powder just kind of transfers to my gloves so I keep having to change them. I blow through a pile of gloves in five minutes, but I did manage to get things cleaned up. So I bag up our mystery flavor, and hang that up in my windows for display.. Things are ok, maybe a bit warmer than I would have liked. I start selling bags of both flavors, things are great.

 I sell out of the first batch and start on the second when my hands start to tremble a little. Ok, it’s hot, so I start chugging my water and get back to work. Across the plaza, I hear a rattling scream. Then another, another, and another. When I look up, there’s several small pockets of people on their knees, screaming and collapsing to the ground, frothing at the mouth or gawking at the heavens above. Their friends watch in horror as they writhe around. 

I glance over at Cami, and she’s on her knees, her face raised to the sky, just like everyone else. I try to rush over to her in case she starts to seize too but my legs won’t let me move. I drop down just like everyone else, staring up to what should be clouds, but instead is the greasy ceiling of my booth. 

Cami starts to shriek, joining the horrid harmony of the poor other souls. 

Being on the floor, I can’t exactly see anything even if my legs would move but I feel like I can hear everything around me. 

The screaming starts to turn into a droning hum as people congregate in the center of the plaza around the big statue. They sort of congeal around it and their sound begins to change from that communal drone to speaking in tongues and begging for redemption. 

My legs start to twitch under me, as if they have a mind of their own. I start to stand, being pulled to the statue myself. As I approach it, I feel the air vibrate, pulling me closer to it, until I’m trying to push myself through the masses at the marble base to touch it and praise her. Cami is on my left, a shambling mess covered in…. Soot? Why does she have soot bleeding out of her nose? They all do.  I jerk my head down to see the front of my shirt covered in soot and ash. We all do. A spark climbs up my spine, jerking my head back up towards the statue. I meet her eye, and begin to beg. I didn’t know the statue was a woman, but she felt like a benevolent soul I must appease. 

The tone of our congregation suddenly shifts, and people are pulling each other out of the way, trying to touch it. I watch my own hands grab the collar of the woman in front of me and pull her to the ground. She sells earrings a few booths from Karen. I quickly take her spot, leaving her lying on the ground in this undulating mass of limbs and soot. 

Someone pushes up behind me and I hear a sharp crack before the woman releases a feral scream that quickly peters out. We don’t care. No one stops to help her. We’re fighting for the right to touch the base of this weird statue. 

As soon as fingers graced the marble base, a surge of power that felt ancient and earthy launched up our arms and sends us into a frenzy. We clammer back into the crowd, letting the people behind us get a taste if they can manage to stay upright. If they fall, they’re underfoot and probably stepped on. With no control over my body, I rush for the nearest structure and begin to claw at the siding, trying to tear it apart with my bare hands. I think it was an enclosed gazebo where teenagers hid in to smoke pot at night. The wood planks had that plant smoke smell embedded in them and it felt like an offense to *her*. I don’t even know who *she* is but I needed to please her. I keep tearing at the boards until something becomes loose and falls to the ground then I move to the next one, this dryadic power telling me to destroy the structure because it’s an offense to her and what she’s provided for the town. I hear someone next to me, trying to do the same to appease her and win her favor. My body begins to grow heavy and slow at this point, and I think I blacked out. 

When I came around again, it was dark outside. The streetlights had come on, and the entire plaza was absolutely destroyed except the statue. Booths and tables had been flipped, the gazebo was missing boards and covered in dark wet streaks. Something had been on fire at one point, but now it was just a pile of smoldering ashes, the smoke hanging in the air. Hopefully unconscious bodies are scattered around, some twitching a little and some totally still. The woman I had pulled down is still in a crumpled pile at the base of the statue, and I couldn’t bring myself to go see if she’d alive or not. 

I pushed myself to my feet again and try to stay upright but my entire body feels like it’s on fire. My fingertips feel raw, I’m down at least one finger nail and maybe a few fingerprints entirely. I all but crawl to my car and climb in, patting around for my keys. Despite the utter chaos of the day, my keys never fell off my belt. This is why we have carabiners people. I crept home, grossly under the speed limit until I pulled into the back of the shop. I drug myself upstairs and crashed on my couch with Demeter on my chest for a few hours. 

I just woke up again, and I needed to write this down. This entire day was fucking crazy and I don’t know what happened but I’m not the only one that lost my mind. Enough people went nuts and caused destruction, we hurt people and someone started fires. The plaza was an absolute mess and I have no idea what caused it. I don’t know why we wanted to touch the statue. I don’t know who she is. I’m scared.  I should call Cami and Markus. I don’t know where they went. I’m going back to bed. 

**Sunday, August 3rd, 9:48  am**

The festival is canceled. But not from the mass hysteria or anything. There’s now an open investigation for embezzlement on the planning committee. And get this… The plaza is totally untouched. The gazebo is fine. No scorched piles of something. No people laying in the grass. All the ash and soot and everything is gone and sparking clean. But I’m still missing a goddamn nail. I don’t know what’s happening. ",2,1765860996.0,consignmentshoponmain,0,1.0,False
1pntd46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pntd46,"HRV in freefall, sleep scores fine. 6 years of Oura data and I've never seen this.","30M — 4 months of nightly nightmares, HRV crashed 43%, but sleep scores are GOOD. Body is ""sleeping"" but not recovering. What am I missing?

I'm hoping someone here has seen this pattern before or can point me in a direction I haven't considered.

THE CORE PROBLEM:
For 4+ months, I've had vivid violent nightmares almost every night — war scenarios, being chased, fighting, losing control of vehicles. I wake up after 3-5 hours, often hot/sweaty, completely exhausted even after 8+ hours total sleep.

THE CONFUSING PART:
My Oura ring shows GOOD sleep scores (80-90) but my HRV has crashed:
- March 2025: 97ms avg (peak 165ms)
- August: 92ms
- September: 77ms
- October: 74ms
- November: 61ms
- December: 55ms avg, with days hitting 31-38ms

On my worst nightmare nights: HRV 31-38 but sleep score 85-90. The Oura thinks I'm sleeping fine. I wake up destroyed.

When I compare to 2019-2020 data, low HRV days came with low sleep scores (~60). That made sense. Now they're completely decoupled — something is different.

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT CONTEXT (past 18 months):
- My girlfriend developed serotonin syndrome from an SSRI. She had severe symptoms including suicidal ideation. I was her primary support through months of this. She's recovered now.
- Significant crypto losses + constant business pivoting (I'm an entrepreneur)
- Some existential anxiety about AI/future

I keep saying these feel ""resolved"" but maybe my body disagrees. The HRV decline started Aug-Sep 2025, which could be a delayed ""crash"" after running on stress hormones for so long?

WHAT I'VE RULED OUT:
- Blood work: CRP 0.91 (low), ESR normal, liver function excellent, toxic metals normal, homocysteine normal
- No alcohol, drugs, smoking
- Consistent sleep schedule, stop eating 3+ hours before bed
- Oura shows normal blood oxygen and breathing regularity

MEDICAL HISTORY THAT MIGHT MATTER:
- Hemochromatosis (managed with phlebotomy) — transferrin saturation still 59%
- B6 was 163% above normal in July 2025 (stopped supplements, but still eating cheese/avocado/eggs)
- Multiple antibiotic courses earlier this year
- Ureaplasma parvum detected (asymptomatic)

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
Vagus nerve breathing, 4-6-8 breathing, chamomile, apigenin, avoiding aged cheese, wind-down routine, noise machine. One thing worked briefly: Dec 8 my readiness jumped to 89 after doing breathwork throughout the entire day + visualization at bedtime. So my body CAN recover — something is blocking it.

CURRENT THINKING:
1. Sleep study to rule out UARS (no snoring, but wondering about silent apnea)
2. Retest B6 (can't find anywhere in Singapore that does this)
3. Maybe I have unprocessed ""caregiver trauma"" from supporting my girlfriend through her crisis?
4. Post-stress autonomic dysfunction — nervous system stuck in fight-or-flight?

MY QUESTIONS:
1. Has anyone seen this sleep score/HRV disconnect pattern?
2. Could UARS cause this even without snoring?
3. Does the ""caregiver burnout rebound"" theory make sense to anyone?
4. Any tests or specialists I'm not thinking of?

I'm in Singapore until Dec 23, then back to Thailand. The exhaustion is giving me dark thoughts. I went to church Sunday and they prayed for me which helped emotionally, but I need to figure out what's physically happening.

I will try to sum this up as much as i can to how i got here: 

I moved in with 3 strangers in aug’ 24, i was a junior and they were freshman. We all got along fine, until we began to notice roommate A was a bit dirty in the sense of leaving dirty dishes out, or ‘clean’ ones out for days to dry and never putting them away. She also moved her bf into the house, and basically told roommate B and i to suck it. B and i were pissed. I spent a majority of last year cleaning the house on my own. Anytime anyone sent any kind of “hey could you do xyz to be more respectful” they were labeled a bitch. 

Fast forward to this year, all was perfect in the start of the sem. We were all getting along w no problems. There were some things still annoying, like still having dirty dishes or stuff all on the counters, but i kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.  

It began with the dishes, for example every fork and spoon being dirty every day. No exaggeration. There were never any utensils, so i bought even more to try to help, but still same problem. I also noticed i was the only one unloading the dishwasher, and also putting away the dishes that were drying for 4 days at a time on the counter? Eventually i forfeited. I said nothing, i just re-bought all new cups, plates, pots, pans, and utensils for me alone to use, to ensure i was only cleaning up after myself. Oh, did i mention everything in the kitchen is mine? Like i bought all of it with my money?  

Anyways, it’s important to note here that this year B moved her bf in, again, not here for days, like fully lives here, doesn’t have another house. Didn’t ask anyone except A. Yes he chips in utilities, not the point. She has been complaining about nobody cleaning, because i stopped. I am only in the kitchen to cook my meals, with my dishes that only i use, i hand wash them, put them away, wipe the counter, and go to my room. I don’t use the living room anymore, it’s always dirty so i try to avoid it. Weird, it didn’t seem to be a problem when i was the only one cleaning? To note: B has two large dogs, and A has two cats. 

A has never cleaned the house. She is primarily the one who contributes to the kitchen mess with dishes and stuff all over the counter despite having ample cabinet space. Wanna hear something ironic? She runs a cleaning business. She even made a joke the other day about how she cleans for a living but has never done our house.. 

So to today: B and I have had numerous discussions about how dirty and disrespectful A is. Today we were discussing it, looking at the counter mess, and we decided to start cleaning. I took a photo of 4 boxes of old food that were on the counter and texted A saying i was throwing it away and asking her to stop leaving old food on the counter because we are getting flies (i didnt even mention her rotting fruit). She came home pissed. Slamming doors, etc. I continued to clean the house, while A went to Bs room and they began chatting it up. I finished, went to my room, and then heard a super fun convo: 

To summarize: B is pissed i keep putting her stuff away instead of leaving it sprawled over the counter. She was also livid at my text to her about her old food to which she said “she is lucky i didn’t beat her a\*\*”. A was laughing and agreeing, and even told her how i asked A if she was going to have my back if she said anything, considering B and i had an entire convo about it earlier today. I didn’t go downstairs or blow up, i am very nonconfrontational. I do not know what else to do, so tomorrow i plan on taking all of my stuff out of the kitchen and living room. This includes silverware, pots/pans, cooking utensils, cups/plates/bowls, micing bowls, tv stand, coffee table, end tables, decor, everything. If they want to sit downstairs and talk poorly of me for asking of such a simple thing, how can i just submit anymore? All I've wanted is a clean house. I also have a text written to let them know, i am not trying to ambush them, I'm just sick of them acting like i want too much, when all i want is a clean house.

Is this the right thing to do? I don’t know how else to approach the situation. I already spend all my time in my room, I've tried to keep the peace. I’m looking into subleasing for next semester, but it’s 50/50 as it is so expensive to move mid lease. If i don’t get to then i am here until July. What would you do? ",1,1765860848.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Seeking advice,"I bought some Koke Honey Ethiopian beans recently from Presta. They run pretty fine in the grinder usually. I noticed my flow rate slowed down a bunch after a couple days, it want from a 4 minute 30 second brew to a 7 minute brew, and can’t figure out what’s going on. Let me break down my kit and then I’ll give details on my brew.

Glass v60
Hario white filters
Zpresso J manual
Drip assist like a melodrip
Instasting kettle
Beans roasted 12/02/2025, I froze some of the beans when i first got them and didn’t freeze some.

Brew: 
- fine grind (1.3.0 on the grinder)
- 210f degrees
- 1:15 ratio at 20g coffee to 300g water
- 60g bloom for 1 minute to 1 minute 20 seconds sometimes depending on roast date
-I use straight kettle for bloom and then use drip assist after doing 60g pulses and making sure water doesn’t sit too high over grounds so I don’t get too much bypass

The problem:
I’ve had this recipe for this Koke Honey bean perfected. I bought another bag and the first cup was perfect. The after that first cup the brew time increased from 4 minutes and 30 seconds to 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Cup was more water down and had some bitter after tastes as if it’s getting too many fines. Then the next day the brew took 7 minutes to brew and had even more of that bitter after taste.
 
Not sure what it causing this. I don’t think it’s the degassing or age because when I first got the bag I froze some and also kept some unfrozen. It is doing the same with both the frozen and unfrozen. My grinder didn’t change. I also tried a brew where I made it courser by 3 clicks and it didn’t change a thing except made it a lot less sweet.

Kinda loss on what’s going on here. Any ideas?

Unless I was asleep, rarely I went past 30mins - 1hr without vaping.

I started to feel like a degenerate when I needed to vape with my gf in the car during long drives.

I posted on this forum before that I was wanting to quit, i bought nicotine gums and everything, I didn’t quit but I definitely reduced the amount significantly at that time, but because of life and stress I went back to my old habit.

So what made me want to quit?

I liked playing spots (Basketball, football, Badminton)

But i didnt play for a long time due to lack of friends who enjoy the same and I was busy with gym. But recently I started to play these sports and realized how fucked up my lungs and stamina is. Only after 10 mins of intense movement my lungs hurt and I had no energy. I asked myself is this fucking vape worth it? My life will only get worse with vape as I get older, your sex life also takes a hit.

With all these thoughts combined, I was pumping gas and smoking my vape, when I noticed it was almost empty (few puffs to go).

I told my self “let me buy 1 last pod and smoke it less so I can gradually stop” (I have said this many times only to buy another pod when it finished)

Then I said fuck it, i took the last 3 hits and threw it in the trash.

For the first week I used 2-3 4mg nicotine gum daily, one with breakfast coffee, one after lunch and rare occasions 1 at 6pm before gym if craving was strong.

Then I combined it with 4mg in morning and 2mg in afternoon, on harsh days I took half gum at night to cope.

It was important to tell myself not to let gums be my new addiction so i never exceeded 3 gums of 4mg daily.

Yesterday I only went on 1 2mg gum in the morning.

Today I haven’t had any, chatgpt honestly helped alot, the craving are only intense momentarily (1-3 seconds) then fade away, its more of a thought than a feeling.

I will see if I can go without any today.

As for negative there is brain fog, anxiety and stress, but you gotta remind yourself that these are temporary. I believe everyone can quit if you are motivated and driven by what matters to you.",3,1765860622.0,QuitVaping,3,0.81,False

I said nothing, i just re-bought all new cups, plates, pots, pans, and utensils for me alone to use, to ensure i was only cleaning up after myself. Oh, did i mention everything in the kitchen is mine? Like i bought all of it with my money?  

Anyways, it’s important to note here that this year B moved her bf in, again, not here for days, like fully lives here, doesn’t have another house. Didn’t ask anyone except A. Yes he chips in utilities, not the point. She has been complaining about nobody cleaning, because i stopped. I am only in the kitchen to cook my meals, with my dishes that only i use, i hand wash them, put them away, wipe the counter, and go to my room. I don’t use the living room anymore, it’s always dirty so i try to avoid it. Weird, it didn’t seem to be a problem when i was the only one cleaning? To note: B has two large dogs, and A has two cats. 

A has never cleaned the house. She is primarily the one who contributes to the kitchen mess with dishes and stuff all over the counter despite having ample cabinet space. Wanna hear something ironic? She runs a cleaning business. She even made a joke the other day about how she cleans for a living but has never done our house.. 

So to today: B and I have had numerous discussions about how dirty and disrespectful A is. Today we were discussing it, looking at the counter mess, and we decided to start cleaning. I took a photo of 4 boxes of old food that were on the counter and texted A saying i was throwing it away and asking her to stop leaving old food on the counter because we are getting flies (i didnt even mention her rotting fruit). She came home pissed. Slamming doors, etc. I continued to clean the house, while A went to Bs room and they began chatting it up. I finished, went to my room, and then heard a super fun convo: 

To summarize: B is pissed i keep putting her stuff away instead of leaving it sprawled over the counter. She was also livid at my text to her about her old food to which she said “she is lucky i didn’t beat her a\*\*”. A was laughing and agreeing, and even told her how i asked A if she was going to have my back if she said anything, considering B and i had an entire convo about it earlier today. I didn’t go downstairs or blow up, i am very nonconfrontational. I do not know what else to do, so tomorrow i plan on taking all of my stuff out of the kitchen and living room. This includes silverware, pots/pans, cooking utensils, cups/plates/bowls, micing bowls, tv stand, coffee table, end tables, decor, everything. If they want to sit downstairs and talk poorly of me for asking of such a simple thing, how can i just submit anymore? All I've wanted is a clean house. I also have a text written to let them know, i am not trying to ambush them, I'm just sick of them acting like i want too much, when all i want is a clean house. I don’t want to be a bad person. 

Is this the right thing to do? I don’t know how else to approach the situation. I already spend all my time in my room, I've tried to keep the peace. I’m looking into subleasing for next semester, but it’s 50/50 as it is so expensive to move mid lease.

i was waiting pa naman for a reply after his bday until the next morning i found out he already unfollowed me. 

that messed up my head kasi he made that gesture the other day and now blatantly unfollowed me. ano kaya possible reason? could be influence from his friends that he drank with? heard issues about me from others? was it my looks when he delivered the coffee? why did he make that effort pa anyway?

1pnt5el,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1pnt5el/finally_burst_ungrateful_wife/,Finally Burst. Ungrateful wife.,"Venting and needing help understanding why some women are so ungrateful when the husband is so supportive. 

Context: both 35, one toddler. 10 years of marriage. 

Problem: my wife is so ungrateful. All I do is work, baby sit, and still have to find ways to better our marriage. It’s driving me insane so I tonight I finally hit a boiling point when she made a snipe comment about me looking at my phone. I laid it out how ungrateful she is and how she doesn’t really give af about my needs. Got into a major fight and talked about divorce cause honestly I’m kindda done. It was so eff up this past weekend when the in-laws were in town and stayed with us so they saw that After a very long work week, I didn’t even hesitate to watch the baby for 7 hrs while she was out with her girl friends Saturday night.  The next day she couldn’t even offer to watch the baby in the morning so I could sleep in. Her parents just shook their head. 

Work situation: i work full time (sometime night and weekend from home when the baby sleeps).  Wife doesn’t work. We have a nanny 32 hours per week (9-5 Monday to Thursday). As soon as the nanny shows up, I’m off to work. I get home at 5ish and babysit while my wife cooks dinner. We eat, clean up, do some chores, and spend time with the family until 9 PM . I put the toddler to sleep at night and usually fall asleep with the baby because it takes too long for the baby to sleep or I’m just too exhausted from work and life. On weekend, we both babysit, do family activities, and chores. And I still put the baby to sleep. 

My wife hasn’t slept with us in 12 months because she sleeps better by herself with our dog. For the sake of her health, I don’t really mind the set up cause it just means she will be more refresh and happy the next day. 

Finance: no finance issue. it’s our wealth. There’s no hers or mine. She has a high limit credit card that she can spend on whatever she wants. I buy her expensive, luxury gifts without hesitation. She worked 10 years before our kid and only retired about 10 months ago bc her job got too toxic and it was impacting our family. 

Wife’s context/ personality: very good mom to the baby. Cook, care, teach the baby. Personality wise, she is a good reasonable person but she is not proactive unless it’s interesting to her.  She’s not the lovey dovey type but show love by cooking food. Doesn’t like to be told what to do (ie she needs to come up with the solution on her own). Had some minor depression and weight issue that have been medically treated and is currently overall very happy since she doesn’t work anymore and has a lot more times, which she spends mostly on Netflix, YouTube, coffee shop, and shopping. 

Things I have done to try to solve the issue before lashing out: 1) suggested a female couple therapist (she brushed it off and think it’s just me), 2) asked for us to set expectations on chores and who do what (which she’s against bc it’s too transactional and she doesn’t want to be told she has to do this), 3) asked for a few hours on Sunday from 1-5 (while the baby nap) for “me time” (she has her in the morning/me in the afternoon), so that we aren’t both babysitting.  4) literally imply/and asked for Christmas I just want some time to myself.  

And no we don’t have sex cause I’m too effing tired to initiate sex after working 50+ hrs and caring for the baby with whatever remaining time I have left. And if I don’t initiate, neither does she. 


TLDR: Wife is so unaware and ungrateful of all the things I do for the family (70% of family and baby care) and how exhausted I am. Why are some women like this? I’m not sure I want to be with someone but I also love my kid and don’t want a broken family.

I will try to sum this up as much as i can to how i got here: 

I moved in with 3 strangers in aug’ 24, i was a junior and they were freshman. We all got along fine, until we began to notice roommate A was a bit dirty in the sense of leaving dirty dishes out, or ‘clean’ ones out for days to dry and never putting them away. She also moved her bf into the house, and basically told roommate B and i to suck it. B and i were pissed. I spent a majority of last year cleaning the house on my own. Anytime anyone sent any kind of “hey could you do xyz to be more respectful” they were labeled a bitch. 

Fast forward to this year, all was perfect in the start of the sem. We were all getting along w no problems. There were some things still annoying, like still having dirty dishes or stuff all on the counters, but i kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.  

It began with the dishes, for example every fork and spoon being dirty every day. No exaggeration. There were never any utensils, so i bought even more to try to help, but still same problem.

I didn't want to do this because his girlfriend has been unreasonable before and he also tends to get mad at me for not being as a okay with him dating. (He had stopped having sex with me and reassuring me for years. We would maybe have sex once every two-three months)

It was supposed to be for 6 months. I tried to bring it back up to lift it but he didn't want to talk about it. He likes the separation because our conflict became less. I wasn't being as triggered. This was suggested by the therapist after he broke our agreement with this GF and his other GF with not using protection with either. He didn't tell me about it till much later. First GF got mad at him because him having unprotected sex with her wasn't special anymore. Second GF broke up with him for putting her in a bad position. I was devasted. His reasoning? Because he was so frustrated with the state of his and mine relationship. 

Fast forward two months after we had gone no co mingling (just her and I, they still dated and huh with our friends) I thought things were going well. He had more sleepovers and coffee dates with her. She got to hang out with our friends. Then I got a text from her saying she doesn't want any greetings from me. Just a nod. It was out of left field. His response was that's what she needed and he is staying out of this conflict between us. I don't even know what the conflict was?? 

Now anytime she is at an event and we buy tickets he will shut down and not want to go. He will say it's how I react because I am anxious about the ongoing things happening and I don't know why. He says I make things hard and I attack him. 

I think I need to let this relationship go. I want him to hinge but it seems like he is in self preservation and won't do anything. He lets her attack me and then says I am making him numb when I get upset about him not communicating with me if I will run into her at events.

The problem: every AI headshot tool I've tried gives wildly different backgrounds and lighting for each person. One looks like they're in a corporate office, another looks like a coffee shop, and the third is in some weird blurred beige void.

What I need:

* Consistent style/lighting across all team members
* Professional but not overly formal
* Same general background vibe (doesn't need to be identical, just cohesive)
* Ideally something where I can set parameters once and apply to everyone

Has anyone dealt with this? Is there a tool that lets you lock in a specific style/environment and then generate multiple people with that same look?

I've tried the usual suspects (HeadshotPro, Aragon) but they seem optimized for individual use. Saw [Looktara](http://looktara.com/) mentioned on reddit does that handle team consistency or is it also single-person focused?

Like my parents knew I was at the risk of diabetes because my mother was diagnosed with diabetes when she was pregnant with me so as a kid I had a no sugar diet. (Although Carb intake should have been lowered too at that time)

So as a result, I never had a sugar craving. I actually actively despise sweet food. That includes donuts, ice cream, pastries, cake and everything else. I don't even drink beverages that much.

They also limited junk or processed food habits. From soft drinks to chips. 

It's not like I don't eat at all but it's so much in moderation. Like once a month thing. I don't remember the last time I had any drink that weren't green tea with no sugar or honey, black coffee or plain water. 

Now, despite all that I had a depressive period in my life where I ate a lot of junk foods (which I don't despise) and I got fat. I didn't excercise or worked out. 

But it was so easy to bounce back to the healthy weight because of my upbringing. 

I limited junks (I loved chicken wings and burgers like everyone else lol) and I ate what I already used to eat. And I started being active (key word : active. I wasn't excercising and still lost weight lol)


Which is my next point. 

My parents focused on diet that was rich with vegetables. Sticky rice (which is high in sugar content though), fermented fishes, soyabeans, lots of meat (duck, pigeon, chicken, wild boar, pork) and again vegetables because there were too many of them in my diet. Every day it was colorful vegetables and pungent strong smelling dried fish curry. 

And that helped immensely to shape who I am today. 

As I currently live alone, working and my life is filled with stress that I struggle to eat properly.. despite all that when I got my vitamin tests done because I feared I was very deficient.. turns out I was STILL normal. I was borderline though! I didn't even have vitamin d  deficiency which a lot of women do.

I see the Magnifica Evo recommended fairly often here and want to see if this one stacks up. Costco return policy is also a big plus. I was considering the De'Longhi TrueBrew but that seems to have fairly bad experiences here. A frother isn't absolutely necessary as I have one from the Nespresso.

""Honey, Chloe is about to give birth.""



""Sign the papers.""



""You should also... take a good, hard look at yourself.""



I lowered my eyes.



My left hand held the phone call from the past.



My right hand picked up a pen, letting it hover over the open divorce agreement.



On one side, I slowly but firmly wrote my name in the space for Party B's signature.



On the other side, I softly responded to that hopeful young man from ten years ago.



""I won't.""



""I won't go loving...""



The pen tip paused.



I took a breath before finishing the sentence.



""...someone else's son, and someone else's husband.""



The other end of the line fell abruptly silent.



A dead silence lasted for several seconds.



Then, an incredulous, low roar exploded from the receiver, mixed with the hiss of static.



""Damn it! What did you say!?""



I didn't listen further.



My fingertip lightly touched the screen, ending this bizarre call that spanned a decade.



Then, I continued, stroke by stroke.



Completing the two characters for ""Lyla Lawrence"" on the pristine white page.



As the final stroke was placed, Ethan Sullivan turned around.



He was no longer the young man from the phone call who would whine and act spoiled.



Time had honed him, his features sharp and distinct, his eyes deep.



The former wild exuberance had settled into a restrained sharpness, and an undisguised scrutiny at this moment.



His gaze swept over the signature on the agreement.



The fingers holding the cigarette paused almost imperceptibly.



After a long moment.



An extremely soft, clearly mocking snort escaped his throat.



""Honey, quite decisive this time?""



I put down the pen, rubbing my throbbing temples.



My voice betrayed the exhaustion that had built up over a long time.



""Let it be, Ethan.""



""There's been no need for us to torture each other for a long time now.""



The mockery on Ethan's face faded slightly.



He narrowed his eyes a little, as if carefully gauging how much of my words were spoken in anger, and how much were genuine.



Right at that moment.



My phone, placed beside me, began vibrating wildly again.



The number flashing on the screen was still that unlisted, familiar old number.



Ethan glanced at it.



The corner of his mouth lifted into a knowing, icy arc, a semblance of a smile.



""What, still can't bear to hang up?""



""Honey, are you really that... pathetic?""



""Even now, still obsessed with such a cheap trick?""



""Finding some scammer with a similar voice, pretending to be me from high school... must have scammed quite a bit of money from you, right? After all, you used to fall for that act the most.""



My body stiffened almost imperceptibly for an instant.



So familiar.



This tone, this posture.



He always managed to find my most vulnerable spot with precision.



Then pierce it in the most casual way.



Every time before, I would break down, cry, become hysterical, just as he wished.



Like a pitiful, wretched madwoman.



But this time.



I just felt tired.



Too tired to even muster the energy for anger.



Wasn't divorce what he had been longing for, even resorting to such methods to force me to sign?



""Hmm.""



I heard my own voice, calm to the point of emptiness.



""You're right.""



I didn't want to argue anymore.



Nor did I have the strength to explain.



I pushed away his hand that had instinctively reached out, seemingly to take my phone.



Right in front of him, I pressed and held the side button.



The screen went dark.



The world was finally quiet.



The triumphant smile that had been playing on Ethan's lips finally froze completely.



After only the briefest pause.



He raised his hand and stubbed out the cigarette butt on the nearby metal trash can.



The motion carried a fierce force.



When he spoke again, his voice was laced with ice.



""Better be.""



""Honey, don't let me find you still harboring any inappropriate thoughts.""



""Otherwise...""



He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished.



But the unspoken words were full of icy warning.



I unconsciously dug my nails into my own palm.



They sank into the flesh, bringing a sharp sting.



How could I not know Ethan's methods.



Just last week.



At the company's quarterly meeting, in front of all the executives and board members, I couldn't help but point at Chloe Evans's still-flat stomach, tearing off the last shred of decency.



I said the child she was carrying was Ethan's.



The next day.



HR called me in for a talk.



Their tone was委婉 but their attitude was firm.



They said my ""recent state was not ideal"" and ""suggested I go home for a good rest.""



The position I had worked nearly ten years to climb, step by step.



The projects I had poured my heart and soul into.



All because of Chloe's bout of crying in front of Ethan.



Because I ""had frightened her.""



Vanished in an instant.



That was Ethan's punishment for me.



Always precise.



Always effective.



I slowly loosened my clenched hand.



Several deep crescent marks remained on my palm.



Then I lifted my head and looked calmly at Ethan.



He had already turned.



His long legs carried him in large strides toward the delivery room.



His back was resolute, without a trace of hesitation.



He walked too hurriedly.



Too fast.



So fast I didn't even have time to say the words that had been circling in my heart for so long—



Stop calling me honey.



From the moment you decided to embrace someone else.



That term of endearment had already become the sharpest mockery.

Chapter 2





If someone had told me ten years ago.



That the person who would eventually cause Ethan Sullivan and me to tear each other apart would be Chloe Evans.



I would have thought they were insane.



In high school, I was the center of attention.



I came from a wealthy family.



My grades were top-notch.



My looks were outstanding.



Wherever I went, I was the focus of the crowd.



And Chloe Evans?



She wore a faded school uniform.



She always kept her head down, hurrying through the hallways.



Her grades were average.



Her appearance was ordinary.



She was as silent as a shadow.



Yet, it was this unremarkable girl.



Who dared to stubbornly follow behind Ethan Sullivan.



Handing him homemade bento boxes.



Even when the whole school knew he was desperately pursuing me.



Just as Ethan tirelessly orbited around me.



She, in her own clumsy way, was chasing after the light too.



The difference was, I eventually accepted Ethan.



While Chloe never received so much as a single glance back from him.



Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.



A year ago, Ethan took me to a business gala.



Under the crystal chandeliers, glasses clinked.



Elegant dresses swirled, and perfumed laughter filled the air.



In the crowd, I saw Chloe Evans.



She wore a wine-red velvet gown.



Her makeup was impeccable.



Her smile was polished.



She held a champagne flute, chatting and laughing with others.



For a moment, I almost didn't recognize her.



What made my heart clench tighter was Ethan's expression.



The hand holding his glass stilled for a second.



His Adam's apple bobbed slightly.



Though that flicker of admiration vanished instantly.



I knew him too well.



I knew what it meant.



What followed was like a farcical play.



Ethan and I began to argue frequently.



Over trivial matters.



Over his late nights.



Over the ambiguous messages on his phone.



Until that afternoon.



Chloe came directly to my home.



She placed a piece of paper gently on the coffee table.



A victor's smile played on her lips.



""Lyla, I'm sorry.""



""I'm pregnant. The baby is Ethan's.""



My mind went blank.



I looked down at the prenatal exam report.



The blurry, small outline in the black-and-white image.



It was like a poisoned dagger, plunging straight into my heart.



Chloe leaned closer, her voice a soft whisper.



""There's something I've held back for years.""



""You didn't really think Ethan loved you because of your charm, did you?""



""What he loved was the halo of being the prom queen everyone adored.""



""Now that the halo has faded, what do you have left?""



My hand shot up.



I slapped her across the face.



Chloe fell to the floor, clutching her abdomen.



Her eyes instantly welled with tears.



At that moment, the door opened.



Ethan stood in the foyer, his face dark with anger.



He strode over and helped Chloe up.



Then he turned to look at me.



The ice in his eyes chilled me to the bone.



""Lyla, look at yourself.""



""You're acting like a shrew.""



""Bullying a pregnant woman. Do you feel proud?""



His words were like ice picks.



Each one driving deep into my bones.



I opened my mouth.



But no sound came out.



I could only watch as he carefully put his arm around Chloe and led her away.



The door closed softly.



Yet the sound echoed in my ears, a deafening roar.



Ten years.



It turns out, to destroy a relationship.



You don't need ten years at all.

Chapter 3





That fight between Ethan Sullivan and me was huge.



I even thought about destroying him.



But every time I picked up a knife, my hands would tremble violently.



Ethan had tried to placate me too.



He stroked my hair, his voice soft.



""Once the baby is born, I'll send her away.""



""We'll go back to how we were before.""



I gritted my teeth and said nothing.



Hatred coiled around my heart like vines.



I hated him for betraying our ten years.



I hated myself even more, for knowing I should let go, yet still being unable to.



We tormented each other like this.



We became the famous bitter couple in our social circle.



During the worst fight, Chloe Evans sent the video to my phone.



The footage was shaky.



The sounds were grating.



I stared at the screen, my whole body turning cold.



By the time Ethan returned home, the place was already in shambles.



I had smashed everything breakable.



Vase shards littered the floor.



The glass frame of our wedding photo was cracked like a spiderweb.



My eyes were red as I cursed him.



I used the vilest words.

I have noticed when we are at home (his place we don't live together) things are great most of the time. We laugh, joke around etc. But whenever we go out it's like a disaster always happens. The other day I we planned a sleepover at his, which was fine. we were eating dinner and i couldn't finish my food and he took the plate back to the kitchen. I allways offer to wash up but he never lets me and tells me to relax. the food was just sitting on the kitchen bench up until the morning. once he saw it i dont know what got him so agitated he slammed the plate into the sink and started saying things like the women in my family usually always clean up etc. I completely forgot about my plate i would have thrown it out. that made me jump and i almost cried. that morning we planned to go to the beach. he was having his usual road rage on the drive there. we were having a good time at the beach for an hour when he expressed that wed go home soon, i told him that we rarely go together and if we could stay for a little longer 45min max to which he agreed. i could see he was getting over it, i got my stuff ready to leave but then some groups were coming to sit near us and he got agitated again and moved so i followed him. i told him lets go home, he kept saying no you want to be here we will stay and obviously i was just ready to go home at that point. so we start walking up the beach my feet are burning from hot sand so i tell him im going to dip my feet in the water and he says ok and he keeps walking. long story short i walked all the way from the beach to our car spot by myself, he was metres ahead of me and didn't look back once even though he says he did and he couldn't see me. he left me there. as i got closer to our parking spot i could see him pulling out and driving off, he says because a car was waiting for his spot. i called him expressing my frustuation and hes shouting on the phone saying walk back im here etc. i get into the car and at this point i was already crying so much.

he was shouting at me in the car driving home, telling me he hates going to the beach with me, he did not believe me that my feet were burning from the sun and i was taking too long to get to the car. in frustuation i shouted loudly to defend myself and he lost is the way he scram at me was like a demon he threatened to even crash the car.  hes screaming to pack my stuff and leave, as im doing that and i leave he stops me at the door and says no come back dont leave like this then he starts saying hes a terrible person he cant control his emotions etc. apologising and begging for forgiveness.

 he ruined my day and he ruins most days out. It's always the days where i want to do something that i enjoy. i never complain doing activities he likes but as soon as its what i enjoy and want to share with him the day is ruined. When its going to places to eat or for coffee its always where he wants to go whats most convenient for him, or what beach is most convenient for him. I feel so numb towards him this is the second time hes left me like that at a place, walked so far ahead of me because of his anger. 

  
so in summary some of the red flags ive come to notice and have probably ignored in the past 

road rage

always angry at the world, at the government 

slamming things when looking for it, doors, cupboards etc. 

slamming dishes 

calling me names (too many to say)

threatening to crash the car while im a passenger 

if i type anymore i'm just going to cry again. this is eating me up. i do love him, i think i loved the person he once was when we first started dating but now i just see him as an angry man. He's my first boyfriend and i am worried if i end this relationship i'm just going to end up in another similar one, or honestly end up lonely which i have experienced majority of my life. He's great with his words, romantic, says all the right things, compliments me, we have chemistry, amazing intimacy and emotionally i did feel fulfilled. now i just feel sort of scared and anxious. i don't know how to approach this or what to do.

I’m having a major issue, and I need some advice on how to handle it.

What do you do with this knowledge?","You are now aware that you can predict the future, using some unusual divination method (ie not any ""standard"" divination method, like tea leaves, tarot cards, or palm reading).  You aren't sure exactly how, but you instinctively know it will be one of 3 methods that you describe to me (eg. reading the splatter of a squashed roach, interpretation of the residue left by instant ramen, gazing into a turned off smartphone)

I will tell you which method actually works for you.

Whatever method it is, it rarely if ever gives you specific details, but it will give you (or your client, if you read someone else) enough of the gist of a situation to help you make the right choice about 95% of the time in terms of general life advice (eg dating, job hunting, housing), and increase the odds of a primarily financial decision (eg buying stocks) working out by about 10%.

For example, you could tell something like ""you will meet a tall woman with red hair in a coffee shop; ask her out, you'll like the results"" or ""Don't bother going to that interview today, the company is terrible"".  Yes, you are getting all of that information from bug splatter, or ramen dust, or whatever.

What 3 methods are you trying, and once you figure out what works, how are you using your new powers?  Any other thoughts?

Keep in mind, you have to actually do the thing to get the results.  If you analyze roach splatter, you can't tell the future without killing a roach (or having your client do so).

I’m a 40M (Polish-Italian, Canadian from SF Bay Area) living in Koto-ku and working in the local Tech/IT industry and looking to meet people who’d be up for occasional workouts, especially endurance-focused training.

A bit about my training right now:

Run

\- Mostly Z1/Z2

\- 6:30 / km pace

\- Usually 60–90 min (happy to go shorter or longer)

\- Finally starting to see improvements. Doing more regular tempo work

Bike

\- Indoor on a Wahoo Kickr

\- Regular Peloton app user (Matt W is my hero)

Swim

\- 2:00 / 100m LCM

\- Mostly at Tokyo Metropolitan Gym

Lift

\- 4× / week

\- Powerlifting-style (bench / squat / DL)

\- Plus bodyweight (weighted chins & dips)

I usually train 2–3 sessions a day, 6 days a week, so I’m pretty flexible on timing.

Yes, the heavy lifting is probably slowing endurance progress… but shōganai, I’m enjoying it 😅

Goals:

\- Either IM Japan, IM California, or IM Malaysia in the next 1–2 years

\- Currently cutting weight (191cm / \~215 lb → aiming for \~180 lb) which is influencing my training goals 

If this lines up with where you’re at and you’d be interested in training together sometimes, feel free to DM me.

Bonus: I’m also big into coffee ☕ and a train otaku 🚆, so happy to chat about that too.",1,1765858919.0,tokyosocial,0,1.0,False
