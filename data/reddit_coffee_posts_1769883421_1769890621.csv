Click on a bot or any object in the hangar that is loading data from their backend and you best go get coffee - it can be 1 to 3 minutes of the spinning hamster wheel of doom.

Has anyone else experienced this?,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am in no way looking for medical advice, I am only seeking others who have had similar symptoms or issues as mine so that I can have a more informed conversation with my medical care team.

I recently purchased a bottle of C8 MCT oil for topical use to fight seb derm on my scalp and chin. Since it's food safe and has anti-fungal properties, I figured it would be good to add a small teaspoon of it to my coffee every morning as well.

For background, every morning I take L-Theanine, Taurine and NAC (also has antifungal biofilm disrupting properties) before my coffee. I then usually have a little food after that for ""brunch"" accompanied by a small yogurt sometimes.

I am not on a strict IBS / SIBO / SIFO / Candida diet, and I regularly have sugary foods, albeit not a lot of sugary foods, but I try to stay away from extremely processed carbohydrates, and I've been adding more yogurts, kefirs and fermented foods like kimchi recently.

After two days of adding the C8 MCT oil (Caprylic Acid) in my coffee, I noticed some unusual side effects (besides more consistent bm's) starting in the early afternoon when the coffee starts to kick in (and I guess all the other stuff starts to absorb?).

The side effects include:

- Extreme anxiety / feeling of dredd
- Lightheadedness
- Additional brain fog
- Extreme muscle tightness around shoulders, chest and lower back (all areas I generally have inflammatory pain)
- Increased heart rate 10-15 beats
- Slight nausea
- Stomach upset

These symptoms were not always consistent, and sometimes I'd get no symptoms at all. So I just chalked it up to anxiety or problematic foods causing stomach issues.

Though, recently I had a colonoscopy and the prep really cleaned me out. It seemed like I may have been removing a lot of the built-up films and junk deep within me.

After the colonoscopy, I started feeling these symptoms mentioned above all at once and they were extreme. Especially the feeling of deep dredd, anxiety and severe muscle pain on my chest, pecs, upper torso and lower back. The chest pain sometimes almost feels like I'm going to have a heart attack but my vitals seemed 'fine' outside of the intense feeling of dredd. With the help of ice packs on my valgus nerve areas or massaging I recover after 1 - 2 hours at most. After these episodes I feel very fatigued.

I only recently put it together that the NAC, C8 MCT Oil (Caprylic Acid) and bowel clense may have incidentily kicked things into high gear!

On the plus side, the seb derm on my face seems to have cleared up a bit, and my scalp is also a little bit better, even considering the dry weather. However whatever yeast loving beasts exist within me have seemingly micgrated to the warmer areas of my body, like behind my ear (right side only), my armpits (mostly right side) and my chest, sometimes causing redness and inching. 

Is this a real herx reaction I'm having? What can I do to support my gut when / if I have this reaction again? I have stopped with the C8 MCT oil daily but I'm still taking the NAC and other supplements in the morning as usual with only some mild side effects. Did I go too hard?

I know it seems very consistent with a real herx reaction but I want to make sure there's nothing else at play here that I should worry about so if anyone wants to play devils advocate I would appreciate a less biased approach. If there's any other subs you recommend to post this I'd appreciate that too. Thanks in advance! ",1,1769890234.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

• Honey Dip - fluffy fresh, fruity, almost floral honey glaze. Even though it was sitting out, it tasted fresher than PP. The interior practically melts in your mouth like cotton candy. 

• Glazed Cake - heavy af, dense, loaded with frosting. Amazing but it needed a half gallon of milk, not suitable for dunking in coffee. 

• Raspberry filled - high filling to dough ratio, a big personal preference is that I don't want too much dough with my jelly. Filling was chunky and reminded me of a bonne maman jam. 

\*\*Peter Pan (photo 2)\*\*

• Honey Dip - I expected more from a donut that came on a tray right out of the kitchen, but it definitly tasted hours old. Less sweet and more cinnamon/spice adjacent than Moe's. Denser as well. 

• Cinnamon Cake - they were out of the sour cream glazed cake, understandable with the snow but also that's the one everyone raves about. The cinnamon cake was fine, pretty dry but fine for dipping in coffee. 

• Lemon filled - larger than the Moe's filled donut, but about even ratio of filling to dough. The lemon filling was the neon artificial yellow custard I remember from gas station hand pies (yum!) The dough was fine, a little on the dense side for me. ",4,1769890228.0,FoodNYC,1,1.0,False

Long vent incoming 💥💥💥💥,"I wish i could be evil and flip out on everyone but i like my coworkers. And also money. But work is so so overstimulating and its hard for me to hear what people are saying when everyone else seems to be able to.

At any given moment all these are going on at once

Radio is too loud (music is awful too)

Milk steaming

Ovens beeping and air blowing

Customers asking me smth stupid

Coffee machine making loud WEEEEEOOOOOOOP noise

Fan going that doesnt serve a purpose

Fridges buzzing

Coworkers fighting to be heard over everything

I have trouble being able to tune out 'unimportant' noise and only focus on who's talking to me, which results in me asking 'what?' 12 times and people get frustrated with me. I don't have hearing problems but how am i supposed to understand you when theres so much unimportant irrelevant NOISE

I only get a 10 minute break bc im part time and the back room isn't much quieter and its too cold to sit in my car. If i go for a 30 sec water break too many times my manager gets upset even though, like william afton, i always come back. How do i not end up losing it on someone? Especially in a high speed retail food service job where during a rush you don't get a chance to breathe.

Today my manager had me on ovens and register all day (which im not the best at) at the same time and got super nitpicky over everything and i guess i snapped at her a little? She's very contradictory and said something like 'dont leave food sitting, ask someone to run food for you, but dont ask someone who's busy' 'ok' *asks someone who seems less busy* 'sure ill do it in a second' 'no dont ask her she's busy!' 'Everyone's busy, i cant ask anyone, what do i do?' and she just said 'don't run it yourself' and then got upset at me for not doing that. The coworker i asked was like later 'i've never seen you get upset like that you're usually very chill' i did nothing crazy, just asked a question. I guess i behave very different at work than i do at home.

Being expected to do both register and ovens at the same time is so unrealistic too, don't leave customers waiting! But dont let the warming queue get too high! But don't let a line build up! But you have to tend to the ovens after every customer and leave the person that was next in line waiting! But dont run food to handoff yourself! Ask someone to do it for you! But dont ask someone who's busy! Everyone's busy? Too bad!

The queue got a little high but not too bad, and when my manager got upset at me i asked her for help (i have trouble asking for help when i need it) and she actually went on register (for once) so i could focus on ovens. After the rush when i was caught up and could breathe for a second she said 'why did you ask me for help, you were fine' BECAUSE YOU HELPED ME. I COULD FINISH THE QUEUE BECAUSE YOU HELPED ME. I COULD NOT DO IT MYSELF AT THE SPEED YOU WANT. NO ONE ON THE PLANET CAN DO BOTH DURING A RUSH GET IT THROUGH YOUR FUCKING HEAD AND STOP EXPECTING THE MOON.

IF ANYONE WANTS TO READ ABOUT ME COMPLAINING ABOUT MY JOB FEEL FREE TO ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I LOVE BEING ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MY JOB (genuinely i really love it its basically infodumping) AND I'M IN A MOOD TO COMPLAIN. I DONT KNOW IF I'M ALLOWED TO SAY EXACTLY WHERE I WORK BUT ITS THE GREEN SIREN THEMED AMERICAN COFFEE CHAIN.

1qscphs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1qscphs/microbehaviors_that_show_people_feel/,Micro-Behaviors That Show People Feel UNCOMFORTABLE in Your Presence (Science-Based Guide on What to Do),"You ever notice how some people just drain the room? Not because they're actively being assholes, but through these tiny, almost invisible signals that make everyone around them tense up? Spent way too much time studying social dynamics, body language research, and communication psychology because I was tired of missing these cues. Turns out, most of us are broadcasting discomfort signals without realizing it. This isn't about blaming yourself, it's about understanding what's happening so you can actually fix it. Pulled these insights from behavioral psychology research, communication studies, and honestly just watching how people interact.

**The Self-Protection Cluster**

When someone's uncomfortable around you, their body goes into subtle defense mode. Watch for crossed arms that weren't there a minute ago, feet pointing away from you even while their torso faces you, or that thing where they create barriers with objects like phones, bags, or coffee cups. Dr. Carol Kinsey Goman's research on body language shows these are automatic responses, not conscious choices.

The distance thing is real too. If people consistently step back when you move closer, or lean away during conversation, that's their nervous system saying ""I need space."" It's not personal, but it is informational.

**Vanishing Act Behaviors**

People who feel uneasy around you find reasons to leave. Short responses followed by ""I should get going,"" checking their phone obsessively, scanning the room for exits or other people. The conversation never quite lands. They're polite but hurried. Their energy is just… elsewhere.

One micro-behavior that's brutal to recognize: when you speak and they don't fully turn toward you. Their body stays angled away, ready to pivot. It's like they're physically keeping one foot out the door.

**The Validation Void**

Uncomfortable people stop validating what you say. No head nods, minimal ""mm-hmms,"" no building on your points. The natural rhythm of conversation where people volley ideas back and forth? Gone. You're basically talking at them instead of with them.

Eye contact gets weird too. Either they avoid it completely or they hold it too long in this frozen, deer-in-headlights way. Natural eye contact has a rhythm, breaking and reconnecting. When that rhythm's off, something's wrong.

**Fake Engagement Signals**

This one's subtle. Forced laughter that doesn't reach their eyes, smiles that drop the second they think you're not looking, overly polite responses that feel rehearsed. The psychologist Paul Ekman spent decades studying facial expressions and found that genuine vs. forced emotions use completely different muscle groups. You can feel the difference even if you can't name it.

**Why This Happens (and Why It's Not Always Your Fault)**

Sometimes people are just anxious. Sometimes they're dealing with their own stuff. But if you notice these patterns consistently with different people, yeah, it's worth examining your approach.

Common culprits from communication research: standing too close (violating personal space norms), dominating conversations without pausing, intense or unbroken eye contact, touching people you don't know well, bringing up heavy topics too quickly, or honestly just having really intense energy that overwhelms people.

**What Actually Helps**

Start by reading ""What Every BODY Is Saying"" by Joe Navarro, former FBI agent who literally interrogated people for a living. This book is INSANELY good at teaching you to spot discomfort signals in real time. Navarro breaks down exactly what to look for and why it matters. The guy spent 25 years reading people professionally. The section on pacifying behaviors alone is worth the price.

**Ash** is this relationship and communication coaching app that's genuinely solid for working through social anxiety and learning healthier interaction patterns. It gives you scenarios and feedback on how to navigate uncomfortable social moments. Not sponsored, just actually useful.

**BeFreed** is a personalized learning app that turns top books, psychology research, and expert talks into custom audio lessons tailored to your goals. If you want a structured plan around something specific like ""become more socially attuned as an introvert"" or ""read social cues better in professional settings,"" it pulls from sources like the books mentioned here plus communication studies and real expert interviews to build a learning plan just for you. You can adjust the depth too, quick 10-minute overviews when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with examples when you want to really understand the patterns. The voice options are weirdly addictive, I went with the smoky, slightly sarcastic tone that somehow makes psychology research actually enjoyable during commutes.

For the deeper psychological stuff, ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane destroys the idea that social skills are fixed. Cabane worked with everyone from Fortune 500 executives to military leaders on presence and communication. She breaks charisma into learnable behaviors: presence, warmth, and power. The warmth section specifically addresses how to make people feel safe around you. Life-changing read if you struggle with this.

**Practical Adjustments**

Give people physical space, like actually step back a bit. Match their energy instead of overwhelming them with yours. Ask questions and then shut up and listen. Watch their comfort signals, if they seem tense, dial it back. Don't trauma dump on people you barely know. Let conversations breathe.

Track patterns in a journal. When do people seem uncomfortable? What were you doing? No judgment, just data. You'll start seeing themes.

The uncomfortable truth is that we're all responsible for how we show up in spaces, even when we don't mean harm. Biology, upbringing, past experiences, they all shape how we communicate. But awareness is literally the first step toward change. Your brain can rewire itself through conscious practice, that's neuroplasticity in action. You're not stuck being the person who makes rooms tense. You just have to be willing to see it, own it, and adjust.",1,1769889929.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False
1qscotq,https://www.reddit.com/r/schaumburg/comments/1qscotq/local_scoop_january/,Local Scoop - January,"**Hey Schaumburgers --- Here is a local scoop on our village. If you're new and curious to know what this is, dig back through this subreddit until you find my post from May 2025.**

**Short version: these are bite-sized updates on things generally not reported by the local paper, Facebook groups, and other sources of news.**

**If there are specific topics you want to hear about or you have feedback, feel free to send me a message or leave a comment.**

**At the bottom are a couple links if you are interesting in knowing more about what the Village is up to.**

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Business:**

* In 2025, Schaumburg had 333 new businesses move to the community. Additionally, there were 46 ribbon cuttings (this must mean new businesses that started new in Schaumburg, not businesses that moved to the community.)
* Office vacancies are beginning to decline. Industrial vacancy is under 3% and there is very little vacancy along Golf and Roselle Rds. In 2026, there will be a focus on further reducing office vacancy.
* 1699 Woodfield Rd will convert to a residential building of 100 apartments
* Following a survey seeking feedback from local businesses, 42 businesses responded saying the following of doing business in Schaumburg:
   * Pros: operations are generally stable or growing; Schaumburg is a supportive place to do business; positive relationship with Village staff
   * Cons: tariffs & national economic policies; space/facility needs; workforce/cost pressures; some permit/parking issues; skilled labor shortage

**New Business - Avellino**: if approved, this will be a sophisticated and upscale concept offering unique martinis, craft cocktails, delicious food and nightly live entertainment located at 1901 McConnor Parkway.

* last occupied by RAM in 2018, this property has been vacant for seven years and the new restaurant plans to open this summer
* per Village policy, the business agrees to support these business (but not limited to):
   * Schaumburg Business Association
   * Schaumburg Township Library District
   * Al Larson Prairie Center for the Arts
   * Schaumburg Park District
   * Harper College
   * School District 54
   * School District 211
   * the Golden Corridor Advanced Manufacturing Partnership
   * the Japanese Chamber of Commerce

**Small Business Forgivable Loan Program**: Schaumburg created this to assist existing small businesses with growth and expansion costs. Forgivable loans are provided with a 0% interest rate at a maximum of $15,000, not to exceed 80% of total project cost, for existing small businesses. Loans are forgiven over a two-year period at a rate of 1/24th per month provided the business continues to comply with the requirement of creating or retaining at least one low-to moderate-income position ($67,150 for a household of one person). Loans may be used to pay staff, advertising costs, lease space, inventory, furniture and fixtures, manufacturing equipment, supplies and raw materials, software and computers, job training, financial management education, facade improvements, awnings, signs and building construction and renovation.

**Coffee with the Council:**

* Asked when the village will get fiber installed, trustees responded saying AT&T is burying and putting fiber into neighborhoods, currently working in the south end of the village. Asked if only certain portions of the village would get fiber, trustees responded the entire village will be covered. As for timing, it is up to the utility companies’ regarding how quickly they will complete it, as they are not subsidized by the village.

**Septemberfest:** a drone light show is being considered for Septemberfest 2026. One was already performed at the 90 North event that took place this past September in celebration of the new community that was built.

**Fly Quiet Program:** the Village is part of O’Hare’s “Fly Quiet Program”, where air traffic controllers try to rebalance air traffic and have them utilize different runways to cut down on noise over homes. Lately, there’ve been challenges due to weather changes or construction at O’Hare that has required airlines to continue flying over neighborhoods.

**Transit updates:**

* Ridership for DART, the trolleys and parking permits for the Schaumburg Metra station continue to rise.
* Following the transit reform bill that was passed in Springfield, parking minimums are prohibited (with some exceptions) around bus stops (within 1/8mi) and train stations (1/2mi). The bill’s intent was to enable housing and business development to occur around these hubs, allowing people to use transit options instead of a car to get to where they need to. Leaders may return to the bill to tweak a couple if items through what’s known as a “trailer bill”. Mayor Dailly spoke with State Senator Laura Murphy who acknowledged legislators may make changes.

**Renaissance Schaumburg Hotel and Convention Center**: Five hundred guest rooms completed renovation in August 2025, but had an adverse impact on bookings. Though a decrease in performance was expected, a decline in bookings was not. Due to imposed tariffs, the government shutdown and its impact on the airline industry, it caused several event attendees to cancel.

**HMart**: alcohol is permitted to be sold at HMart’s food court, once they open. Presently, only Woodfield Mall is permitted to sell alcohol in their food courts. Customers must drink it in the food court area and are not allowed to leave the food court with it.

**Chicken Raising**: regarding the property owner permitted to raise chickens in their yard, they cannot have more than six at a time, no more than one duck, roosters are prohibited, cannot sell the chickens or eggs, and will inspected annually by the Health Division.

I have made it far in interviews, including with some big tech companies. Final rounds, strong feedback, “keep in touch” emails. But nothing has turned into an offer.

What’s really messing with me is that I’ve had almost zero luck with small to mid-sized (banks, start-ups) Toronto companies. Most don’t respond at all. Some reject without explanation. Others say they’re pausing hiring or going with someone more experienced.

I’m honestly at a point where I feel lost and burned out. When people in the industry tell you your portfolio is solid and you’re “doing the right things,” but the results don’t follow, it’s hard not to take it personally.

Please comment if you see an error in this guide or you have something to add and I’ll update it. Link this guide to every hiring question, or better yet mods pin this to the top. If you’re new and this guide doesn’t answer your question, list it below and I’ll update the guide.

Source: 20+ years with the department, hired lots of firefighters

**For 2026 hiring, you will probably not get an engine position offer unless you are Category 0.**

**For 2026 hiring, you will probably not get a handcrew position offer unless you are Category 1.**

Why? Because the department is shifting to “Traditional” staffing, meaning that every engine will have 1 FC, 1 FAE, and 1 FF staffed on each Type III engine daily. This reduces the total number of engine firefighters in each unit, and all units still haven’t transitioned fully so it’s only going to get worse for firefighters who wish to be on an engine. In many CNR units, all open engine firefighter positions are being filled by transfers from the unit’s firefighter handcrew if they have one.

I fully anticipate the department moving to a FC, FAE and FFII staffing model for engines within the next two years. This will mean that all engine FFers will be permanent FFIIs, and the only seasonal FF1 positions would be on handcrews or at air bases.

Anyways... how to get a job:

1.      **Make an account on CalCareers (calcareers.ca.gov)**

2.      **Find the job posting for Firefighter I (**[**https://calcareers.ca.gov/CalHrPublic/Jobs/JobPosting.aspx?JobControlId=495209**](https://calcareers.ca.gov/CalHrPublic/Jobs/JobPosting.aspx?JobControlId=495209)**)**

3.      Follow the instructions given in the job posting. **Read them thoroughly**.

4.      Fill out the work location form correctly ([https://incidents.fire.ca.gov/media/42chxu24/2026-wlf.pdf](https://incidents.fire.ca.gov/media/42chxu24/2026-wlf.pdf))

a.      Depending on how you fill out this form, you may be invited **via email** to a “Hiring Rodeo” for firefighter handcrews in the unit that you ranked #1. This will increase your chance of being hired.

b.      As noted on the form, you can change your unit rankings on the work location form once.

5.      Set yourself up for success by acquiring the certificates/training to get you into the highest category possible, following this category placement list: [https://www.fire.ca.gov/-/media/1EAFA2A1528141EE892CB692D4B982E0](https://www.fire.ca.gov/-/media/1EAFA2A1528141EE892CB692D4B982E0)

**6.**      You can update your certificates by emailing [FFHiring@fire.ca.gov](mailto:FFHiring@fire.ca.gov). What you submit in the initial application will determine the category placement for the first round, but submitting certs ASAP and calling the firefighter hiring hotline can bump you up into higher categories, sometimes for the first round but usually will take effect during the second round depending on when you submitted them.

**Application Periods:**

The application is open year-round. To be considered for the first round of hiring you need to have applied before a certain date, typically by November 30^(th). If you applied after that date, you will be considered for later rounds of hiring depending on when you applied.

To be eligible for hiring in 2027, you’ll have to re-apply after Nov 1st of 2026, even if you applied in October 2026.

**Politicing**

December is an acceptable time to start reaching out to engine stations/handcrews you ranked the highest on your work location form. They may ask you to wait until you get a category placement email. Call them first, don’t show up unannounced.

Bring a short-form resume, dress nicely, and bring PT clothes. If you’re going to bring a “gift”, a bag of good ground coffee is a safe choice, but not necessary. When contacting handcrews, ask to PT with the crew. You’ll probably hike or go for a run, although it could be some type of circuit. Be prepared, be humble, keep your mouth shut and put in max effort. You may get questioned by the captains, engineers or senior firefighters about equipment or job duties, especially if you come from another fire agency or have relevant experience listed on your resume.

**Notification Timelines – first round**

**Category Placement:** You’ll typically get a category placement email in the first week of January. This will tell you your engine and handcrew placement categories for the first round of hiring. This is a good time to reach out to stations or programs you are hoping to get hired at.

**Hiring Rodeo:** Shortly after your category placement email, a handcrew program may reach out via email and invite you to a hiring rodeo, most likely only from the unit you ranked #1 on the work location form. 100+ other potential candidates may also be in attendance, and they’ll have short-form interviews and resume reviews conducted by the FCs and FAEs at tables set up at the facility.

**Job Offers:** the first round of offers will typically start to be made in February for Northern Region (CNR) and sometimes as early as the end of January for Southern Region (CSR), this can vary though. They will usually be from one of the top 4 units that you ranked, and may not be your #1 pick. My suggestion is to accept the first offer you get, work there for two seasons, then transfer to your desired unit as a Category 0. Offers will continue to go out into the summer, and units will typically make their final offers by the end of April or into May for the upcoming fire season, however you could potentially get an offer after that. Once you accept an offer from a particular unit, no other units will make you an offer.

Don’t jam up the hiring hotline with questions about when offers are going out, keep an eye on this subreddit as there will be posts with their offers and what unit they were placed in. Be patient, there are lots of reasons you may or may not have received an offer, and a lot of it comes down to the number of positions in each unit and how you ranked them.

**After accepting a job**

Every firefighter goes through a short new hire/rehire academy, these will run periodically from March to June and the start dates will vary depending on when you received your offer, your medical clearance, etc. They are 1-2 weeks long, and their content/intensity depend on what unit or program you get assigned to. The unit that made your offer will reach out and give you a start date, just be aware that sometimes they’ll call you a week or less before your start date so have your uniform/boots purchased as soon as you get an offer.",6,1769889668.0,calfire,1,1.0,False

I want to talk about one of the most challenging—yet ultimately fertile—phases of growth: the ‘Undefined.’ 

We’ve all been there: the job ended, the relationship shifted, the old version of you no longer fits, but the new, clearer identity hasn't shown up yet. This ambiguity can feel like a profound failure. We often feel compelled to rush out and define ourselves instantly, but true healing requires allowing that messy middle ground to simply *be*.

**The Trap of the Undefined:** When our goals, identity, and destination are unclear, our brain tends to panic and freeze. We try to solve the massive, existential question ('Who am I?') with inaction, which only increases the anxiety.

**The Healing Power of the Micro:** 
When the macro picture is undefined, we must zoom in to the immediate micro-task. You don't need a five-year plan; you need a five-minute action. The goal in this stage is not progress toward a distant outcome, but *presence* in the moment.

These tiny, defining actions are your anchors. They remind your nervous system that you are competent and capable of finishing *something*, even if that something is making coffee or watering the single plant on your desk.

**My practical suggestion:** If you feel completely adrift, pick one action that takes less than 60 seconds and is solely for the benefit of your future self. (Example: putting the clean clothes away, not just folding them.)

**Now, I turn it over to you. For those of you currently embracing the 'undefined' space (or who have successfully moved through it):**

What is your go-to, small, non-negotiable action, ritual, or thought that brings you back to earth when your identity, future, and direction feel completely ambiguous?",1,1769889627.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

1qscjmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qscjmt/how_to_observe_like_sherlock_holmes_sciencebased/,How to Observe Like Sherlock Holmes: Science-Based Techniques That Actually Work,"Most people think observation is just ""paying attention"" but they're missing 90% of what's happening around them. I've been obsessed with this for years after realizing I walked past the same coffee shop for months without noticing it had changed owners. That's when I dove deep into research on perception, cognitive psychology, and yeah, even studied how fictional detectives process information (don't judge me).



Here's the thing that blew my mind: our brains are constantly filtering out information to prevent overload. We're literally designed to miss stuff. But the cool part? You can train yourself to notice way more than you currently do. I pulled this from neuroscience research, books on expertise development, podcasts with actual detectives and magicians (they're insanely good at this), and psychology studies on attention.



1. The Baseline Method



This is straight from Spy the Lie by three former CIA agents. Before you can spot what's unusual, you need to know what's normal. When you enter a new environment, spend 30 seconds doing a mental sweep. What's the lighting like? Background noise level? How are people positioned? What's the general vibe?



Then when something changes, your brain flags it automatically. I started doing this at work meetings and holy shit, you pick up on tension, alliances, and who's actually paying attention vs who's mentally checked out. It's like unlocking a whole new layer of reality.



The book is genuinely fascinating. The authors spent careers interviewing suspects and they break down exactly how they read people. It's not some mystical talent, it's a learnable framework. Insanely good read if you want to understand human behavior on a deeper level.



2. Active Questioning



Most people look at things passively. Shift to active mode by constantly asking yourself questions. Why is that person wearing a jacket indoors? Why did my coworker suddenly change their usual coffee order? What does that graffiti style tell me about this neighborhood?



This comes from research on expert cognition. The difference between novices and experts isn't just knowledge, it's that experts actively interrogate what they see. They're running constant hypothesis tests in their heads.



Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes by Maria Konnikova dives into this perfectly. She's a psychologist who studied at Columbia and breaks down the actual cognitive science behind observation and deduction. The book won't teach you to solve murders (probably) but it will completely change how you process information. She explains why our default ""System 1"" thinking makes us miss obvious details and how to engage ""System 2"" deliberately. This book made me question everything I thought I knew about my own perception.



3. The Detail Anchoring Technique



Here's a practical one: when you meet someone new or enter a space, force yourself to notice and mentally note three specific unusual details. Not ""they seem nice"" or ""this room is messy"" but concrete specifics. ""They have a faded tattoo of coordinates on their wrist. Their shoes are expensive but scuffed. They touched their neck twice when mentioning their job.""



This practice comes from memory research. When you anchor observations to specific details, you're creating stronger neural pathways. Plus it stops your brain from creating those lazy generalized impressions that are usually wrong.



4. Sense Rotation



We're stupidly vision dependent. Like 80% of our processing power goes to visual input. But you're missing out on tons of information from your other senses.



Try this: spend two minutes focusing exclusively on what you can hear. Then smell. Then tactile sensations (temperature, air movement, texures). You'll be shocked at how much data you were ignoring.



The app Headspace has some solid mindfulness exercises that train this kind of sensory awareness. I know it's marketed as meditation but honestly it's just attention training. The ""noting"" exercises where you mentally label sensations without judgment are perfect for building observation skills. 



If you want to go deeper and connect these observation techniques into a structured learning path, BeFreed might be worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from books like the ones mentioned above, expert interviews, and cognitive science research to create personalized audio podcasts. You can set a goal like ""master observation and reading people"" and it'll build an adaptive plan based on your specific interests and schedule. 



The depth is customizable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus you get a virtual coach you can chat with to ask questions or get book recommendations. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator if that's your thing. Makes commute time way more productive than scrolling.



5. The Opposite Game



This one's from lateral thinking research. When you observe something, deliberately imagine the opposite or alternatives. Someone seems confident? What if they're actually insecure and overcompensating? This place seems abandoned? What if someone's living here secretly?



This isn't about being paranoid or contrarian. It's about breaking your brain's habit of jumping to the first plausible explanation and stopping there. Real observation means entertaining multiple interpretations until you have enough data.



The podcast Hidden Brain by NPR has an incredible episode called ""Why We See What We Expect to See"" that explores confirmation bias and pattern recognition. The host Shankar Vedantam interviews cognitive scientists about how our expectations literally shape what we perceive. It completely changed how I approach observation.



Bonus insight



The biggest barrier to observation isn't lack of skill, it's cognitive load. When your brain is stressed, tired, or overwhelmed with thoughts, your observation ability tanks. That's why Sherlock could seem superhuman, he had the luxury of focusing entirely on observation without worrying about bills or relationship drama.



You can't eliminate life stress but you can create brief windows of low cognitive load. That morning walk, that quiet coffee before work, those are your prime observation windows. Your brain has bandwidth to actually process what's around you.



Start with just one technique. Pick the one that sounds most interesting and practice it for a week. You'll start noticing shit you never saw before. And once you realize how much you were missing, you can't unsee it.



The world becomes way more interesting when you're actually present in it. Not in some zen mindfulness way (though that helps) but in a ""holy shit there's so much happening around me constantly"" way. People are fascinating. Environments tell stories. You just have to train yourself to read them.",1,1769889564.0,SocialBlueprint,1,1.0,False

When I was a kid, there was a girl in my class from class 1. I had an attraction towards her, and later I found out she also had a crush on me at that time.In class 4, boys and girls were separated, and after some time she moved to another city.
After few years, she messaged me and told me that she had a crush on me in childhood. I told her I felt the same. We talked for a few days, but then she unfollowed me, saying her sister doesn’t allow her to follow unknown boys. She explained this again after around 2 years. I thought maybe I was disturbing her, so I stopped messaging her.
Around 2.5 years later, I accidentally sent her a follow request from my second account. She accepted it, we talked again, but after some time she said the same thing and unfollowed me. Still, the conversation continued. Conversation happened for 4–5 times. Each time, the chats became shorter, the replies slower, and  there were gaps of around 5–6 days between messages. I never wanted to disturb her, and we both had class 10 board exams , so because of that also there were breaks in conversation.
I asked some normal and silly questions like tea or coffee, political ideology, etc, but nothing romantic or serious. From her side, it was clear that she saw me only as a friend.
In the last conversation, I asked her honestly if it feels weird that I message her even though we have never talked face to face. She said it doesn’t feel weird. But after that, when I texted her again after 4 days, she didn’t reply, even though she came online multiple times.
Now I’m confused about what I should do. I feel that if I am a problem or if she doesn’t feel like talking, I should stop messaging completely. But this situation is affecting my mind a lot. She lives permanently in another city, and I don’t talk to any other girl  I keep thinking about her only and till now i like her

**Money Diary**

**Monday:**  
9am: I wake up late, pour some coffee, and get to work immediately, feeling incredibly unmotivated. I’ve been in a slump the past month or so. A few weeks ago I suffered a freak medical emergency, and then last Monday my boyfriend ended our relationship. I’ve been either sleeping too much or not-nearly-enough lately; last night fell in the not-nearly-enough camp.

10:15am: I take a work break to make breakfast and a French press.

2pm: I order grocery staples through Instacart **($22.59)**, but it’s definitely not enough to last the week. I figure I’ll pop up to the grocery store later today.

4:45pm: Last Wednesday, two days after my breakup, I downloaded Hinge in a panic to convince myself there are good people out there who are ready for a relationship – I’m still feeling unconvinced. But I matched with 6 people and then paused my profile. I’ve been softly texting someone, C, since Friday but have no date lined up. He randomly texts me now and asks if I’m feeling spontaneous! I say yes but tell him I need to wrap up work. I do that and hop in the world’s quickest shower to get ready.

5:30pm: I hop on a bikeshare and head to my date **($2.44)**. We have a lovely time! He’s not actively dating right now, so this is his first date in a while. It’s my first date looking for a *relationship* in quite some time (more on that later…). The conversation is nice. We each have two drinks and split some snacks. When the check comes, I pull out my card to offer to split, but he asks if he can pay. I accept the generosity. As I walk back to the bikeshare bike, I ask if he’d like to do this again - he says yes but that he is not a planner and that since I *am* a planner I should reach out. My last relationship was a lot like this, and I’m not feeling really on board with it.

8:20pm: I head home via bike share **($2.25)** but take a pit stop at my dive bar, which is a block from my house. I have one beer **($5)** and chat with some regulars and the bartender.

9:30pm: I walk home, heat up some frozen potato skins, and watch Jimmy Kimmel.

11pm: Bedtime!

Daily total: **$32.28**

**Tuesday:**  
7:45am: I wake up feeling slightly more motivated than yesterday and pour some coffee. I read a little bit in the morning. I’m in between two books right now - *Infinite Jest* and a non-fiction review of MLMs. Both are interesting.

9am: Get to work.

10am: Breakfast break!

2:15pm: Work is a drag, and I’m feeling anxious about my upcoming schedule. I inadvertently put too much on my plate this week. I drown my anxiety in several tiny packets of gummy bears. They’re stale.

5pm: Take a shower and start getting ready for my date tonight. A pivotal detail about my recent breakup – that was an open relationship. Since we were non-monogamous, I have several people I’m still seeing, although none of them with the level of emotional or physical intensity as the one that just ended. This is actually great because I have an amazing built-in support system, but sadly none of it really compares to my ex to me. Tonight I’m seeing a woman, J, I’ve gone out with a few times. I’m still figuring out compatibility (which is pretty normal for me - I’m a slow burn). She’s married and works in tech, and we have a ton in common, so we tend to do a lot of fun activities together. I enjoy spending time with her!

6:15pm: Call a Lyft and arrive to the restaurant right on time **($13)**. We have dinner and drinks at a decently nice restaurant in a trendy part of town. I paid for the last date, but while I had the medical emergency she sent me a pricey care package, so I cover this date as well **($181.89)**. Dinner is nice - it's great to catch up since it's been a while since we've seen each other.

8:30pm: We walk to our next destination, a honkytonk bar around the corner. It’s Two-Step Tuesday! J has never two-stepped before, and I’ve done it a handful of times and LOVE it. We cut a rug, and she’s really good at it! She buys our drinks at this spot.

10pm: J lives fairly far from the bar, so she leaves early. We kiss goodnight. She offers to give me a ride home, but I want to stay and keep dancing, which I do. I buy myself one more drink **($16)**, stay for a few more dances, and call an uber home **($8.52)**.

11pm: I’m having a hard time sleeping. I call a friend I know will be awake and talk to him for a while.

1am: Bedtime!

Daily total: **$219.41**

**Wednesday:**  
8am: I wake up, pour coffee, and get to work.

10:15am: I’m feeling like a baddie this morning… and order some McDonalds breakfast, one of my guilty pleasures, through Doordash **($21.70)**. It’s divine.

The workday is normal - nothing interesting to report!

6:30pm: I scuttle to the bus to get to pottery and manage to make it on time **($2.25)**. I lament that I forgot my Kindle!

7pm: Pottery is great. I’m feeling inspired from last night and listen to honkytonk on my airpods the whole class.

8:50pm: Leave the studio and catch the bus home **($2.25)**. I miss my stop - I’m kind of new to taking the bus, so this happens sometimes. It’s FREEZING outside, but the extra couple minutes to walk home from the next stop really aren’t too bad. As an aside to my dating life and to honkytonk: about a month ago I met a man, K, at a honkytonk night, and we went on a date or two. After those dates, he left the city to play music on a cruise ship for 6 weeks. I’ve been thinking about him a bit today and shoot him a text. He seems pretty into me, and I’m not so sure how I feel about him: he’s super sincere which is about the opposite of my personality. I don’t know him well enough to gauge any layer of compatibility yet, but we do have amazing dancing chemistry.

9:15pm: Get home. I’m hungry but have no real dinner at home since my Monday date thwarted my second grocery run this week. I get quick groceries delivered through DoorDash **($18.83)** and make a frozen pizza from that haul. I putz around the house for a while and clean up a bit. I think about K and what to do about all that. It’s better than thinking about my ex.

11pm: I crawl into bed with a late night snack. I’m asleep before midnight.

Daily total: **$45.03**

**Thursday:**  
7am: wake up and snooze until 8. I have coffee and start work right away. I have some appointments in the afternoon so want to get as much done this morning as I can.

9:30am: Breakfast break! I also use this as an opportunity to tint my eyebrows.

3pm: I take an Uber to the doctor for my annual checkup **($7.54)**. It takes *forever.* I thought I’d be there for an hour but end up at their office until about 4:40pm. I have a haircut scheduled for 5:45pm; I take an Uber up to the salon **($20.67)** and figure I’ll work from the coffee shop next door until my appointment.

5pm: Turns out the coffee shop is closed, but my stylist can see me now because she had a cancellation! My stylist is my long-term ex’s (from years ago) sister. She’s been doing my hair for 8 years and is amazing. We always catch up on my dating life, her family, our careers… I just love seeing her, and she’s incredibly talented. She gives me a $10 discount on my haircuts. After tip, the haircut is **$125**.

6:30pm: Even though my stylist saw me early, the cut takes forever. I call an Uber to the grocery store **(16.89)** to grab my remaining essentials **($57.92).** One special treat for myself is that when I physically go to the grocery store, I reward myself with scratch-off tickets. I buy **$10** worth and then grab an Uber home **($7.07)**. TOO MANY CABS. I hate it! In the cab on the way home, a neighborhood friend texts me and tells me he’s at the dive bar, that he won a bunch of money gambling on the playoffs, and that he’ll buy me whatever I want. I laugh to myself because drinks at this bar are $3, but I call him a moneybags and tell him I’ll come out after I get some work done at home.

7:30pm: I get home, and I indeed work for about an hour, wrapping up a cost summary I’ve been working on all day and organizing some files for my boss.

8:30pm: I head to the bar, have exactly one beer that is paid for by my friend, and catch up with folks. A bunch of regulars are there; we always catch up on my pottery, their travels, music, and sports. It’s nice to see everyone! I do my scratch-off tickets and tell my friends that if I win the $400,000 grand prize I will buy drinks for the rest of the night. I do not win that prize, but I recoup my $10 back!

9:30pm: I get home, hang out for a bit, and have trouble sleeping.

Daily total: **$245.09**

**Friday:**  
8am: I wake up, have coffee, and get to work at 8:30am

It’s a good day! I have a lot of calls, but it’s not bad. It’s the start of our annual review cycle, and today I’m finishing my self reviews. I’m feeling really proud of the work I’ve accomplished in the past year, so I really gas myself up.

6pm: I wrap up work and start to get ready for a date with B, a man I’ve been seeing weekly-ish for a while. We plan to go bowling! While I’m taking a shower, I shave and find some… bumps that weren’t there before. I, of course, softly panic for approximately 10 minutes before calming myself down. I call B and give him a head’s up - he has a clear head about it - and then text my ex asking if we could have a quick phone call. I wanted to see if he’s also experienced anything like this. My ex is busy, but we decide we’ll connect tomorrow. Even though I had been in an open relationship for several months and am seeing a few people, I’m such a slow burn that intimacy isn't a given. Regardless, it is the potential cost of doing business, and I accept this. I call a friend to talk through it together, and he helps me to calm down.

7pm: I take an Uber **($15.66)** (ugh) up to the pottery studio where I wrap up work on some pieces I’ve been working on.

8pm: B picks me up from the pottery studio. We both use an ATM (**$3 fee)** and grab hot dogs from a local stand **($5.75).** From there we go to a bar we've been to a few times and find backgammon boards! I coincidentally had just taught him how to play, so I’m pretty excited. We play several games. He buys a round, and I buy one **($16.33).**

10:30pm: B asks if I still want to go bowling. I had completely forgotten about that by this point. We realize the bowling alley closes at midnight and it’s probably too late. We decide to go to karaoke instead! The bar we go to is super crowded, but we have a great time. He buys a round, and I buy one **($13)**, and we both sing.

1am: We head back to B’s house and go to bed. I cry a little from all the emotions of the day/life.

Daily total: **$53.74**

**Saturday:**  
10am: we wake up, cuddle, and have coffee. I Uber straight to therapy **($12.51).**

12pm: after therapy, I take a bikeshare to my local coffee shop **($1.87)** and snag a chai and a breakfast taco (**$15.88)**. I walk home and call my doctor to see when I can get in. I’m supposed to have a women’s appointment the following Thursday but decide I really need the peace-of-mind or action plan sooner rather than later. They tell me they don’t have appointments available but that I can walk in if I’d like.

1pm:  I take a bike to the doctor **($2.06)**. It’s the same doctor that did my annual physical on Thursday! She’s so nice. She knows I’ve had a really stressful time lately. She takes a look at the bumps - ingrown hairs! I’m so relieved that I cry at the doctor’s office. I text B to give him the news and text my ex to explain we no longer need to talk on the phone.

2pm: I walk to Lowe’s. I’ve been considering painting my office for a while and decide I’ll get started on that this weekend. I have a last-minute pivot and pick a completely different color than I thought I would, plus some supplies **($86.91).** Since the paint is heavy and the supplies are inconvenient, I grab an Uber home **($9.46).**

3pm: I couch rot a bit and order Wendy’s to drown the stress of the week **($19.91).** It's not lost on me that I just bought groceries. There’s an issue with the order, and DoorDash gives me $13 in credits back.

4:45pm: I have a date tonight with a woman, D, who currently lives out of town with her husband but is here this weekend for work. She has been super supportive through all my unfortunate life things that have been happening lately. I take an Uber **($11.64)** to my destination, which is coincidentally around the corner from my Tuesday date spot.

5pm: I arrive; our date is at a putt putt bar! As soon as I see D, I feel relief. She is a sight for sore eyes, and I haven’t seen her since November. We have a couple drinks, play putt putt, and watch the playoffs. We decide we’re hungry and walk to a spot around the corner and have a delicious Spanish meal. A man sitting near me at the restaurant’s bar (we didn’t have a reservation in a neighborhood where you really need one - so the bar it is!) was being really obnoxious to me, but apart from that it is a lovely dinner. D pays.

8pm: we grab an uber back to my neighborhood and pick up a bottle of wine at the wine shop nearby. One of my friends is working, so we chat with him for a bit. I try to pay for the bottle, but D insists. We walk back to my place, enjoy a glass, talk, and cuddle. I cry a little bit. She understands.

11pm: D leaves. I go to bed.

Daily total: **$160.24**

**Sunday:**  
8am: I wake up and have coffee. I have a massage at noon and have a productive morning ahead of that: I practice some banjo, read, and start painting my office.

11:45am: I call a cab to my massage **($8.30).** Unfortunately I arrive late which is pretty annoying. While I’m in the car, I get a text from a friend that a restaurant near us has a new special: $1 mimosas! But the special ends at 1pm, and I’ll be in for my massage until 1:30pm, so I pass.

1:30pm: the massage was good! Not the best I’ve ever had but definitely worth the ClassPass credits I used to book it. I tip **$24** and call a cab home **($9.10).**

2pm: I have evening plans to celebrate a friend’s birthday and kill time by making soup and continuing to paint my office. The soup is pretty basic - chicken and whatever vegetables I had on-hand. I made it spicy. It’s delish!

5pm: I take an Uber with my friend to the bar where we have booked a 45 minute curling session! Curling is fun, but it’s FREEZING. My friend and I split the cost of the evening so our birthday friend doesn’t have to pay anything. Curling costs **$40** after the split. We have some food and drinks and watch the playoffs. My friend wants to go to my dive bar to finish the game, so we call an Uber there. Our team loses in the final minutes of the game, which is a bummer, but we all celebrate the fantastic season. I walk home around 10pm. We reconcile costs later. Splitting food and drinks 2 ways across the 3 of us, plus the cab split, comes to **$127** owed from me.

10pm: I get home and order food (I justify it with my credits!) **($11.50).** I’m exhausted from the busy weekend and feeling tender.

11pm: I go to bed.

Reflection:

This was not a normal week. I had more dates than usual which came from a few things (including the medical recovery and a confluence of schedules). Being so busy impacted my energy levels, alcohol consumption, and spend. I did have a fun week though! It was great to be busy and productive, while also celebrate a friend's birthday. My recent medical issue also meant I have been working out less than usual, so that was unusually absent from this week, too. I also took an **offensive** number of Ubers this week: extremely unusual for me, and I hate it!

1qscftv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1qscftv/i_believe_i_was_sad_by_a_colleague_last_weekend/,"I believe I was S/A’d by a colleague last weekend, and I don’t know if it’s worth it to press charges.","I have been assaulted in the past, and this whole week has been a big, dissociated blur. Last week, I had coffee with a colleague, we spoke on the phone several times, and agreed to hang out during the day when our work was closed due to weather. My car broke down and I was without a ride, so he offered to drive me. We went to my friends house and had coffee, it felt nice and normal. He suggested cooking for me at his place and I said yes. I thought we may get intimate at some point, but not immediately. Not the second we got into the door, took off shoes. He grabbed me and shoved me against his refrigerator. I said take it easy, and that I’d rather not do that in the kitchen. We went to his bedroom, and he immediately whipped out his dick and asked if he could rip my clothes. I said no. He took them off roughly, and I again said let’s be a bit more gentle. He turned me over, put on a condom, put his penis in me very roughly, and started calling me names. It happened very quickly. He kept saying “you’re a little bitch aren’t you”, “you do whatever I fucking say”, and “you don’t decide what I do to you”. He grabbed the back of my hair and started shoving my head in a “yes” motion after saying these things. He grabbed my breast so hard I saw a light. I said STOP and began to sob, curling up in a ball. He stopped, but was defensive and said “I didn’t know”, and I said well now you do- you can’t just do that without consent. 

The worst part is, I felt stuck. But also that I wanted to make peace. SO I STAYED around while he made food, ate with him. Eventually he drove me home and I messaged with him after that. But the next day, I knew something was wrong… I didn’t feel well, I felt outside of my body. He offered to give me a ride to run an errand and I said yes. Why, I don’t know. When he picked me up, he grabbed my face and shoved his tongue in, saying “I’m marking my territory”. After we got back to my house, I think he finally picked up on the vibe that I wasn’t interested, tried to make me feel bad about not complimenting him enough- and I finally just said, “enough”. He left and I haven’t spoken to him since. I see him at work and I look past. But I know what happened was fucked up. I think he’s a potentially dangerous person. He’s very big and very strong. The disguise he wears is so well curated. To go from being a nice teacher guy straight to calling me names and hurting me as soon as I was isolated with him makes me believe this guy has done this a lot. And perhaps why he moves around a lot.

This said- why go through the trouble of pressing charges when there’s no “evidence”, no way to prove anything. I was in a violent relationship years ago and took him to court and it was dismissed because there wasn’t enough “evidence”. Sometimes abuse doesn’t look like it does in movies. Covert, quiet and calculated. But I don’t want anyone else to go through that, so I speak up. But idk what good telling the police would do other than get this ass hole’s hackles up.

Every time I opened Instagram, I saw another St. Louis business post some version of:

“We stand with the ICE Out protest. However, we’re staying open today. A percentage of sales will go to \_\_\_.”

I get that small businesses are in a tough spot. Margins are thin, employees need hours, rent doesn’t stop. I’m not trying to drag anyone personally.

But isn’t a huge part of protesting the sacrifice?

Like… the whole point of a shutdown is absence. Disruption. Saying “this matters enough that we’re willing to lose a day of revenue” is kind of the statement. When everyone adds a “however,” it starts to feel less like solidarity and more like risk-managed alignment.

The donation angle is better than nothing, sure. But it also turns collective action into a transaction. Buy a coffee, feel like you participated. That’s a very different thing than actually participating.

I think what made it especially noticeable was just how many posts followed the exact same script. “We support this… however…” Over and over. It started to feel like the idea of the protest was being endorsed more than the protest itself.

Curious how others here felt. Totally open to hearing perspectives from business owners too. Just trying to make sense of why it left such a weird taste in my mouth.",0,1769889222.0,StLouis,15,0.42,False
1qsce0y,https://v.redd.it/44wc6ez7pqgg1,Newish worm bin,"I started my urban bag worm bin around September. I feed it every week with about 4-5 cups of vegetable/fruit trimmings, coffee grounds and tea leaves and the same a pint of shredded cardboard slightly moistened.

The good news is that I see active worms (see video). If I grab a handful of the raw material I pick up atleast half a dozen or dozen worms. There is no smell so I’m not over feeding. The worms aren’t trying to escape so the conditions are ok in there.

I’m not sure if the worms should be more active or should be eating more. Every week when I add stuff I still see most of last weeks feeding sitting around. Since I’m a n00b I dunno if the bin is doing ok or great or not so good.

However I noticed I’m kind of in that “grey zone” many others may be familiar with. My options for dating have felt quite underwhelming, and even though I still respond and go out with these women for coffee, dinner, etc. it feels like more of a putting in effort kind of thing on my end rather than a natural process, like how attraction should be. I have yet to feel that sort of excitement/thrill/nerves that I get when simply just talking to a woman who I’m genuinely attracted to and is my type. I often find myself thinking about these other women whom don’t see me that way, don’t want anything to do with me, and reject me when I do try and make a move, but are nonetheless my type and who I’d rather date. It’s honestly sent me into a bit of a spiral recently.. because if I’m not good enough for my type, yet not willing to pursue the ones who see me as their type, then..should I just invest my time being fulfilled alone and living comfortably without a partner?

I’m still drinking caloric liquids (ie coffee with milk&sugar, juice, kefir) but I almost feel scared to eat anything. I am 24 and have had disordered eating since I was twelve but never had this feeling before and it’s just such a strong conviction that it’s throwing me off. I’m not counting the calories in my drinks (although I admit I do keep a mental tally and try to keep it under an amount that would put me above my TDEE). Does anyone else struggle with this?

1qscalq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1qscalq/my_lighter_course_load_is_making_me_anxious/,My lighter course load is making me anxious,"Hello,

So I am a science major and I'm used to taking 3 STEM classes a semester. This semester it worked out that I only have 12 credit hours for class plus another 2 for a research lab. I am only taking 2 STEM classes.

Yet I am almost feeling more anxious than I did with higher workloads. I have SO much free time yet I panic and get ALL my work for the week done in the first like 3 days of the week. Not because I want them out of the way but because I feel like I need them done ASAP so that I won't run out of time to do everything. I run out of things to do to prepare for my exams yet still worry that I won't have enough time to fully prepare for them. It is almost like my brain hasn't caught up to the fact that I am WAY less busy this semester. Even getting coffee with a friend makes me anxious because of this irrational anxiety about not having time. Also it feels almost wrong or like a failing on my part to have so much free time. A part of me feels like a true STEM major doesn't have time to sit and do things like write this post.

I have also been struggling with the lack of schedule this semester since one of my classes is online and my classes get out pretty early. But I'm not sure how to add more structure/schedule to my life. I go to the library on a schedule but run out of things to work on there.

I'm not like bored, that isn't the issue, I just am frustrated that I feel so anxious about time despite having way more time than I usually do. Has anyone else experienced this?

Edit: I don't need suggestions about what to do with my free time, I have hobbies and social stuff that I do. I just don't like feeling like I have no time because logically I know I have plenty. But my anxiety isn't listening to logic atm

# Reflections

I splurged a lot at the drugstore this month. Most of it was for restocks, but I also bought retinol for the first time, which cost 20€. I bought a new nail polish for 10€ as well, but it’s not even usable! I’m going to reduce my spending next month by not allowing myself to go to the drugstore at all; if I need a replacement, I’ll buy a cheaper version at the grocery store.

We also ordered too much takeout, but to be fair, it was exam season at university. I’ll definitely try to reduce that next month.

Next month, my goal is to spend more on travel and experiences rather than material things and food.

I recently purchased a bottle of C8 MCT oil for topical use to fight seb derm on my scalp and chin. Since it's food safe and has anti-fungal properties, I figured it would be good to add a small teaspoon of it to my coffee every morning as well.

For background, every morning I take L-Theanine, Taurine and NAC (also has antifungal biofilm disrupting properties) before my coffee. I then usually have a little food after that for ""brunch"" accompanied by a small yogurt sometimes.

I am not on a strict IBS / SIBO / SIFO / Candida diet, and I regularly have sugary foods, albeit not a lot of sugary foods, but I try to stay away from extremely processed carbohydrates, and I've been adding more yogurts, kefirs and fermented foods like kimchi recently.

After two days of adding the C8 MCT oil (Caprylic Acid) in my coffee, I noticed some unusual side effects (besides more consistent bm's) starting in the early afternoon when the coffee starts to kick in (and I guess all the other stuff starts to absorb?).

The side effects include:

- Extreme anxiety / feeling of dredd
- Lightheadedness
- Additional brain fog
- Extreme muscle tightness around shoulders, chest and lower back (all areas I generally have inflammatory pain)
- Increased heart rate 10-15 beats
- Slight nausea
- Stomach upset

These symptoms were not always consistent, and sometimes I'd get no symptoms at all. So I just chalked it up to anxiety or problematic foods causing stomach issues.

Though, recently I had a colonoscopy and the prep really cleaned me out. It seemed like I may have been removing a lot of the built-up films and junk deep within me.

After the colonoscopy, I started feeling these symptoms mentioned above all at once and they were extreme. Especially the feeling of deep dredd, anxiety and severe muscle pain on my chest, pecs, upper torso and lower back. The chest pain sometimes almost feels like I'm going to have a heart attack but my vitals seemed 'fine' outside of the intense feeling of dredd. With the help of ice packs on my valgus nerve areas or massaging I recover after 1 - 2 hours at most. After these episodes I feel very fatigued.

I only recently put it together that the NAC, C8 MCT Oil (Caprylic Acid) and bowel clense may have incidentily kicked things into high gear!

On the plus side, the seb derm on my face seems to have cleared up a bit, and my scalp is also a little bit better, even considering the dry weather. However whatever yeast loving beasts exist within me have seemingly micgrated to the warmer areas of my body, like behind my ear (right side only), my armpits (mostly right side) and my chest, sometimes causing redness and inching. 

Is this a real herx reaction I'm having? What can I do to support my gut when / if I have this reaction again? I have stopped with the C8 MCT oil daily but I'm still taking the NAC and other supplements in the morning as usual with only some mild side effects. Did I go too hard?

I know it seems very consistent with a real herx reaction but I want to make sure there's nothing else at play here that I should worry about so if anyone wants to play devils advocate I would appreciate a less biased approach. If there's any other subs you recommend to post this I'd appreciate that too. Thanks in advance! ",1,1769888459.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I quit caffeine for about 2 weeks, I drank energy drinks for several years a day, sometimes every other day. Sometimes I drank 1 Hell energy drink and sometimes two. I do strength training 3 times a week, I also use pre-workout supplements with caffeine, so sometimes on the day of training I took a pre-workout supplement before training and then an energy drink during the day. A week after quitting, I woke up in the morning, my heart was racing, after a while it stopped. Then I went to training and after the pre-workout it caught up with me again. Then came the stress, fear for my life, that I would die. I am 27 years old. During the week it happened to me again, my heart rate jumped to about 135 bpm, chaos, stress. I called the ambulance, they took me to the hospital where they did an ECG 2 times, took blood. All the tests were always fine, no sign of disease or heart damage, no heart attack, nothing. The doctor said that it was not a life-threatening condition, that my heart was completely fine. The longest I was in this state was about 40 minutes. Then I found this article and a discussion with you, that some of you subsequently switched to coffee. So I started drinking coffee, one and maximum two a day. I feel that it has improved since then, but sometimes I have cold hands, I still sweat, a few days ago I had another symptom that it was coming on to me, but since I already know that I will not die, that it is not a heart attack, I tried not to notice it so much and after a while it went away. So I would like to ask you, do any of you have such experiences, how long can this last and whether you also had tests that were completely fine and you had to figure out yourself that it must be caffeine. How to properly handle it, get rid of it and stop being afraid and stressed about it? Thank you very much for the answers.",1,1769888415.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I met a guy through work but we did completely different things so I never had to work with his team really but I was occasionally in his branch doing some coordination work with other teams. Well, we never officially dated, but over several months there was a slow, organic connection that built. It wasn’t chaotic or overly flirtatious. It was subtle, intimate, and almost domestic in feeling even without being sexual.

What made it confusing was how real it felt, especially in the details.

It started with music. One day at the office we realized we liked the same song, and something clicked immediately. It wasn’t flirty at first just natural, easy. But the energy shifted quickly into something warmer and more focused.

Not long after that, he asked for my number, and he did it openly, in front of two other girls at work who clearly liked him. There was no secrecy, no “sliding into DMs later,” no ambiguity. He chose that moment, in that setting, after we’d connected over music. That detail mattered to me because it showed intention. This wasn’t something I imagined or projected — he initiated but in mind well he wanted to just connect and that’s all.

From there, music became our language. He’d share songs, react genuinely when I sent something back. We sent voice notes. Inside jokes. Little check-ins. Certain songs started to feel like “ours” you can say.

There were also physical moments that weren’t accidental.

When we walked together, he’d place his hand on my back guiding, protective, familiar. He stood close, not crowding, but choosing proximity. Our hugs lingered just a second longer than polite. He held eye contact when I spoke, leaned in, lowered his voice, created a small bubble even in busy spaces.

There were acts of care that stuck with me:

He once went out of his way to get me snacks because he wanted to “take care of me.” And even put them in a plate and put them in-front of desk cause he saw me busy.

•	He made me morning coffee at the office we had nice conversations and then a week later I surprised him with coffee with a mug that still sits in his kitchen cabinet cause I forgot it with him, he kept it and joked about it. He told me he lost hope that’d I show up to his branch so he can give it to me, so I told him he can use it and give it to me whenever convenient. Until now, he hasn’t given it lol.

•	He noticed when I was tired or off and softened his tone.

•	He remembered details about my life without me repeating them.

None of it felt manipulative or forced. It felt instinctive.

And that’s what made it hard because I wasn’t imagining intimacy where there was none. It was there.

Just… inconsistently.

Then came the moment that shifted everything.

At a concert I look around to find him with another woman clearly a casual hookup while he was still warm and familiar toward me. I dropped him a text cause we agreed we will see each other somehow; moments kick in and he came by without her, hugged me amorously and told me I looked beautiful, acted as if nothing was wrong. Got us shots without involving her and touched my hair a little while we were walking. He even went around his friends and introduced me as the most talented person ever to show me off. The contrast was jarring.

On top of that, he made me meet his group and I vibed with one of his close friend’s brother, he was cool but nothing escalated. But I would see him throughout staring at me and then kissing, hugging the other girl it was awful. But I didn’t show him it affected me and I was dancing and having fun until it hit me the next day.

It wasn’t jealousy that hit me. It was clarity.

I realized that what I was feeling wasn’t casual and that he wasn’t capable of holding something deeper responsibly. The physical closeness meant something to me. To him, it seemed to exist only in the moment.

After that night, things cooled naturally. No confrontation. No drama. Just distance because I felt for an entire month that I shouldn’t be around him, I should just move on slowly and surely.

Recently, after some time passed, I reached out once — kindly and warmly to share that I had left the company and to wish him well. He replied fairly and he was engaging but something felt constraint as he mentioned (he joked about himself “I need to behave”). Anyway I told him I’m moving on from the company and he acknowledged the impact I had. Asked about my plans. It felt sincere. Told him there will be tea later, he said ready with no plans in sight.

And then… he let it sit there. Didn’t respond to my final message which was me telling him “i also believe you will rise up and high one day, I mean you’re a great team lead 😌”

No follow-up. No reopening. No suggestion to meet. Just restraint.

That’s when the truth finally settled in:

He liked me.

He was attracted to me.

He enjoyed the emotional and physical closeness.

But he didn’t choose me.

Not because I wasn’t enough, but because choosing me would’ve required:

\- clarity, consistency, emotional leadership and accountability for how his actions affected someone else

And he wasn’t there.

What hurts isn’t rejection.

It’s disappointment.

Disappointment in realizing that someone can be attentive, gentle, physically affectionate and still not able to show up fully. That chemistry and tenderness don’t automatically mean readiness.

I don’t think he’s a bad person.

I don’t think he intentionally hurt me.

I think he chose comfort over courage.

And I’m choosing not to stay in a loop hoping someone will rise to a level they haven’t chosen for themselves.

It still sucks.

I still miss his voice sometimes. His eyes. The ease.

But I’m slowly accepting that missing someone doesn’t mean they were right for me it just means something real passed through my life and didn’t stay.

Men continue to disappoint.

Question, If you’ve been through something similar, how did you let go of the almost without turning it into self-doubt?

TL;DR: Met a guy at work and formed a slow, genuine connection with emotional and physical closeness (music, care, touch). He initiated and showed interest but never followed through or chose me. Eventually realized he liked me but wasn’t emotionally ready or capable of showing up consistently.

I'm 66f prediabete, I've been doing hacks to check my glucose numbers with a cgm...
I'm trying to stop eating sweet pastries but they are to good to give up ...
My sister brought me some jelly roll, now that she went to our carribean island....
So I did two different hacks:
First hacks: First I drank 2 tbsp of cider vinegar then I ate 3 Oz of pork chop, bell pepper stuff with cheese, ½ avocado and a piece of jelly roll after that walked for 15 minutes, these were my numbers: before eating 98 after eating 1 hrs after went to 142, I recovered after 4 hours, went back to 98. My sugar jumped 44 points. This was around 6:00 pm 
Second hack: next day around 8:00am
Drank water with 3 tablespoons of chia (previously soaked) had the same amount of jelly roll with black coffee no sugar.
These were my numbers: before the chia it was 108 after eating it went 123, it jumped 15 points
And  in 30 minutes I recovered to 108 again. 
I put all this in Google AI and this it says:
Why it worked: Chia seeds are a powerhouse of soluble fiber. When they hit the water (and your stomach), they form a thick gel that acts like a physical barrier. This slows down how quickly your body can absorb the sugar from the cake, preventing that sharp ""spike"". 
Vinegar & Protein (Buffer): Apple cider vinegar (ACV) and protein (pork chop, cheese) work by slowing gastric emptying and improving insulin sensitivity. While this ""buffers"" the sugar, it doesn't create the same physical ""trap"" that a thick chia gel does. 
On the first day, you ate a heavy meal (pork, avocado, chiles, cheese) followed by cake. This creates a massive amount of work for your digestive system.

What would you do moving forward in our positions?,"Last night I (28F) got drunk on ft with my long distance bestie. My husband (26M) was at his second job working until midnight. Well I went on Omegle which if you don’t know is a website that can connect you to strangers to video chat with from around the world. I guess I was desiring attention and validation and really just wanted to have flirty banter and feel good about myself in ways that I don’t feel usually. I used to go on Omegle frequently as a teen and talk to people for hours. It’s weird the connections you can make with strangers and how you can just present yourself to be exactly who you want to be perceived as. Moving on, my husband came busting into the door around 11 very upset bc he had been listening and watching me talk to guys through a camera we have in our home. I was wasted, being stupid and selfish. I wasn’t naked or dirty talking but I did flirt and wanted to be desired. Having this fight last night was not easy bc I was drunk but I took accountability straightaway. I didn’t try to minimize or excuse my behavior. I understand how I’ve betrayed him and broken our trust. He took a couple shots last night and acted like he was forgiving me but it was just the alcohol. He passed out on the couch. This morning he was cuddling with me in bed. After I made my coffee I went to him again apologizing and trying to have this conversation properly now that we are sober. He didn’t want me to touch him, he dint want to talk. He told me he can’t do it and that now he sees me differently and doesn’t know how he’ll be able to move forward without trust. I get it. I gave him a little space and then again tried talking and apologizing but he kept his same stance. He had some stuff he had to get done so he was out of the house for a bit and when he got back he told me he loves me and gave me a hug and a kiss. Things are not okay though. I will do anything he needs of me to rebuild our trust. I’ve never hid anything from him, he always has access to my phone or social media anything if he ever wanted to check it out. So he can obviously still do that if it will help him. He works two jobs m-f all day long so he feels like how can he trust me while he’s out. I made a huge mistake in a drunken selfish mentality. I will not ever let that overcome me again. I feel absolutely ashamed and sick about how I behaved and have made him feel. Any advice for moving forward? TIA.",0,1769888079.0,Marriage,5,0.43,False

1qsbu17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qsbu17,"Old school hyperbike, old school touring!","After finishing off a set of tyres after 8,000 km on the ’Busa and fitting fresh rubber last week, the urge to test them properly over long, varied terrain became unavoidable. It turns out Bridgestone motorcycle tyres are impressively hard to source, since they are unavailable through both official and unofficial channels, which is a rare achievement in a country where almost anything else can be procured by asking the right chai stall. And with the S22 hypersports being homologated just for the Hayabusa, I realised I had a better chance of finding an honest politician in India. So I opted for the Power 6s, a decision made with the resigned pragmatism of a man who knows when the universe has already voted. International forums suggest they are a good replacement for the OEM tyres, with many even calling them a minor upgrade. I remain cautiously sceptical until proven otherwise, because blind faith is best reserved for religion and extended warranties. A work trip to Vaduj near Satara arrived at exactly the right moment, like a polite but firm invitation to misbehave responsibly. Roughly 1,000 km all told, give or take the usual detours justified as “efficiency of avoiding highway traffic.”

The old Kriega US40 came out, went onto the rear seat, and once again demonstrated what real luxury actually looks like. It never asks for attention, approval, or validation. You load it, hook it once, and forget it exists until you need something from inside. It simply works, quietly and without drama, which is increasingly rare in both luggage and adult life. It is a blind replacement item if it ever fails, assuming it does so sometime after the ten-year no-questions-asked warranty expires, which currently feels like a legal fiction rather than a real deadline.

That calm competence is a rather sharp contrast to the emotional and sensory overload of the machine it is strapped to. At 9,000 kilometres in, it is genuinely difficult to imagine a motorcycle better aligned with what I want, short of one that also files your taxes and makes tea, which is a department now ably handled by my wife anyway. Any fans of Bengal liquor tea/lebu cha?Anyway, I digress. Back to the Falcon.

On-tap thrust from the right wrist that makes the planet feel like it is rotating backwards. Check.
Agility that embarrasses most machines marketed as tourers, despite their brochures insisting otherwise with straight faces. Check.

Proven, abuse-tolerant ruggedness suited to Indian conditions, potholes included free of charge and without prior warning. Check.

The sheer privilege of riding a living, breathing legend, with just enough menace to keep your licence in a permanent state of conditional optimism. Double check. 

I have ridden many machines across genres, and nothing makes me giggle like a teenager after a catastrophically bad joke quite the way this one does, repeatedly and in wildly different situations. It is hard to see any other bike coming close to this level of versatility. To repeat my favourite statistic, it makes more torque than any ADV bar one, and only litre-class track monsters manage to exceed its horsepower, which feels faintly unreasonable and entirely delightful.

And the power 6 tyres are more than up to the task of handling what the 1,340 cc motor delivers. First impressions suggest they dance even better than the stock Battlax S22 hypersports, which is saying something given how competent those already were and how little they ever put a foot wrong. One thousand kilometres done on seven-day-old tyres, without incident, drama, or regret, which in itself feels like a small personal victory. A new baseline appears to have been set, quietly and without ceremony, as all good things should be. Its not a review or an initial impression of anything. Far more capable people exist out there for this job. I am just a hobbyist trying to make sense of things as I go along. 

It is, by most reasonable standards, a very good life. ",10,1769887945.0,indianbikes,3,1.0,False

I realized I was trying to visualize an action (consulting) when I should have been visualizing an object.

So I tried a different workflow: I printed a physical dummy version of our audit report (literally just a binder with our logo). Took a photo of it on my desk with my phone.

Then I ran that photo through a product transform tool--basically the stuff e-com brands use. It kept the logo/text perfect but generated professional environments around it (coffee shops, boardrooms, sleek desks). 

Suddenly I had ""lifestyle"" shots that felt real because the lighting/shadows were generated but the focal point was an actual photo. No creepy faces, no stock photo cheese.

It feels a bit like cheating, but the CTR is decent and I didn't have to hire a photographer.

I even remember I would thank the lord on my way out of church that I finally had a close group of friends, that’s how glad I was for meeting him.

After we graduated, I was looking to move out of my moms and I ran headfirst into the disaster that is rent prices. He was actually the first one to mention looking for a roommate. His dad was kicking him out because they’d been having bad arguments, which was insane. How could a family just treat each other like that? Anyway, we decided to be roommates. He got this office job right out of college, and I started working at a restaurant and it was a done deal.

The first time I noticed something was off was during that second day as we were unpacking. Rob was grilling me ‘cause I was blasting some girly pop music while I unpacked (Chappell Roan is highkey fire, no matter who you are), so I started looking around to get my get back. I’m not of a wrathful nature, but it was fun messing with Rob. I started poking around his stuff and seeing what I could break into.

“Yo, Hersch, don’t go looking in my stuff. Come on dude,” he said as he watched me scheme. My name’s Herschel by the way.

“Nah, nah, nah, you started it. What secrets you got up in here?” I said as I grabbed a medium sized cardboard box that felt pretty heavy. Dashing across the room, I ripped the tape off and opened it hoping to find something incriminating. I froze in place. It was full of needles. Not like an ‘oh, he likes sewing’ amount of needles. This was much more like, ‘does he sell needles?’ Anyway, the box was filled to the brim to the point where it’d be a disaster if this thing spilled. We’d never find all the needles. “Umm, big dawg, what the hell is this?” I asked, holding it towards him.

“Tch, man, that’s my shit yo. It’s needles, dude,” he said as he grabbed the box out of my hand and closed it. He stomped away muttering, and he looked genuinely upset. My initial surprise flipped into hilarious confusion, and I burst out laughing. What was he, some kind of closeted seamster or something? What the hell? I swear I didn’t mean to judge Rob, my right hand to god I didn’t. But it was definitely unusual.

“Nah dawg, what WAS that? WHY do you have a box of them?” I asked, doubling over in laughter.

“Dude, it’s just needles. It’s from my nana. She sewed her whole life. It’s sentimental,” he said, frowning. I took a deep breath and stood up straight, because family is no laughing matter. The fact I’d held something important to Rob even sent a subtle pang through my unsteady heart.

“Alright, bet. Imagine you were some kinda psychopath though? Like you just start eating them with food and shit? Hahaha. Like you just have a bowl of needles and milk for breakfast?” I asked, forcing a laugh and trying to play it off. I hope I didn’t come off rude and insensitive before. Rob paused for a moment, looking down at the box in his hands. Then he grinned and laughed at my joke.

“Hahaha, yeah, that’d be ridiculous. But no, I’m not eating them, dude,” Rob said, putting the box down where it started. Honestly, if it just ended at that, I wouldn’t have to type all this up, but it doesn’t! It gets weirder! Oh Rob, why couldn’t it just end there?

I should mention that prior to this, there was another weird thing about him, but again, on its own it was nothing. Tuesdays. As long as I’ve known Rob, he’s always gone radio silent on Tuesdays. I always figured it was either something to do with his family or maybe he just used Tuesdays to do some sinning, like hooking up or drugs. I never asked about Rob’s dating life. One of the other guys ran with the hookup thing and we started calling it Rob’s ‘Tuesday touching and sucking’, hahahaha. The problem is that when we moved in, I learned that’s not what it was at all, to my relief and horror. 

A few days ago was the first Tuesday since we moved in. I woke up to rumbling at like, 9 am, and I sat up in bed confused in the dark. It was coming from just past the door to my room. It sounded like a garbage truck was passing by, or something. I stood up out of bed and listened. I didn’t know if Rob was moving furniture around or what?

“Rob, is that you?” I called out. I reached for the door to the living room but I stopped short, my hand hovering just above the knob. Standing in the light of the door frame, I felt the dull ache and disorientation of a hangover come over me even though I didn’t drink the night before. The sunlight spilling across my feet from under my door was beaming bright, and looking at it made me feel worse. I swear I didn’t remember getting drunk the night before but I clearly had a migraine and I was even sweating a little so maybe I did? I swear I’m a temperate dude, hahaha.

“Yeah, man, I’m just moving a bunch of stuff across the living room. Got your door blocked. Wait a sec, I’ll let you know when it’s clear,” he said through grunts. Sure enough, the rumbling moved over to his room, and then I heard his door close. He shouted “Alright!” through the walls so I opened the door. Everything was arranged normally, cast in a dim light from the window that looked out to an overcast sky. I was gonna head back into my room to sleep in more, but then I heard the mumbling. It was Rob mumbling in his room, which was now locked. Creeping over to his door and I listened closely to make out some of the mumbling. The door was warm to the touch.

“Let it pass. Please. For the love of God, let it pass. Come on. Go down, go down, go down, go down…” Rob was mumbling in a strained voice, breathing heavily on the other side of that door. I thought he was sick or something, so I just went back to my room to sleep.

The thing is, when I woke up from my nap, nothing much had changed. I walked out of my room to see that Rob’s door was still locked. Nothing in the living room was out of place, so I was puzzled as to what he moved around earlier. I could tell he was still there too, because he was shuffling around in his room, and it sounded like he was rummaging through his drawers for something. I just gave up on thinking about it and got dressed for work. Because I work at a restaurant, I can usually sleep in and don’t really have to get ready until like 3 in the afternoon. 

I sat on the couch in the living room to put my shoes on. To clarify something, I should mention at this point that our apartment is pretty small. The living room was just wide enough on the one wall to perfectly fit the couch against it with a tall lamp able to squeeze in the remaining corner space. As I sat on the couch, I noticed in the corner of my eye that the lamp was tilted slightly. I got up and straightened it out, or at least I tried to. It wouldn’t stand straight up. I leaned over to see what was obstructing it on the floor, and there was nothing there. It just didn’t fit between the couch and the wall anymore. I tried pushing the couch over, but it wouldn’t move. I checked the other side of the couch but it was right up against the wall. I checked both ends of it two more times and stood there stupefied. Either the couch grew somehow, or the room was…smaller? 

Looking around, I could see that other things were huddled a little closer together than I remembered. I know houses shift a little due to temperature or something, but this would have to have been several inches of shifting. I was so confused, and walked over to Rob’s room to get another opinion.

“Yo Rob, I think I’m tripping over here. Can you take a look at this?” I called from outside his room. Whatever rummaging he’d been doing stopped all at once. 

“I’m busy Hersch. I’m busy today, man. You know this,” Rob said from his room.

“Dude, I’m serious. I think the living room shrunk, haha. It’s nuts. You gotta take a look at this shit,” I said, knocking on his door with a little urgency.

“What!? No…” Rob said before immediately wrenching his door open. Bloodshot eyes greeted me without their characteristic warmness, along with a wrinkled shirt and furrowed eyebrows. He wasn’t his usual handsome self, and kind of looked like garbage. He was gripping his shirt with white knuckles like he had chest pains or something.

“Yo, what’s good with you?” I asked, taking a step back. There was that dull headache again.

He looked down at himself, burped, and shut the door again saying he wasn’t feeling well. Something’s definitely up with him, but that’s not what caught my attention. In the time that he opened the door, I glanced into his room. They were everywhere. All over the floor, his desk, and bed, were needles like he’d just dumped that box all over the room. The worst part was that they’d been stacked high on a plate on his desk. They were on a plate! I think I saw something I shouldn’t have. 

On Wednesday, he was fine. He dapped me up like usual, went to work, and swung by the restaurant to chill like nothing happened. I didn’t bring it up to him, instead I did something I still don’t agree with. I have off on Thursdays, so while he was at work I snuck into his room. On a first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Upon scouring the corners, I started to find them. Needles left that he’d missed when he cleaned up, in corners, and stuck in his sheets and clothes. I know I’m wrong for sneaking about but I’m so weirded out by this. My brain was overheating just piecing this together in a way that doesn’t make Rob out to be crazy until I opened his drawer. 

Sliding open the drawer, what hit me first was nausea and a dizzying ‘something’ burrowed through my thoughts and made me stumble. It was like a picture was physically forced into my mind too blurry and alien for me to make out, disorienting me so that I squeezed my eyes shut. When the sensation faded I opened my eyes to see horror, and the gruesome consequence of my curiosity. I shut the drawer immediately, and tripped out of the room, slamming the door behind me. Even though I knew Rob wasn’t home, I kept glancing around and checking the locks on the doors like he was gonna come rushing in any minute. I still keep glancing out the window even now. I don’t even know if I’m allowed to type out what I saw there, but honestly I want to vomit even now. Just imagine the worst thing that can fit in a drawer I guess, and picture needles all over, and you’ll be close enough. 

I just don’t understand, but I want to. I want to understand Rob. I want to get closer to him. This needle thing just doesn’t make sense. It can’t. Then there’s the living room. It’s still smaller by the way. I had to move the lamp so that it now sits in front of the couch. When I talked to Rob about it, he shrugged and chalked it up to it being an old house like it wasn’t an issue at all. Unless he just carpentered the room down a few inches as a prank or something, I don’t get it. That lamp definitely fit in that corner when we first moved in. Now it doesn’t. 

The worst part of it all is that today I went back into his room while he went to the store. The plate is gone, but there’s still needles in corners. I was ready to believe I made it all up but then I noticed it as I turned to leave, the thing I tripped on on my way out before. There’s a gap between his floor and the doorway, and it’s at an angle. Somehow, someway, it was like his room was rotated a few degrees. My mind started spiraling again so I just walked out the house and grabbed a drink with a buddy to take my mind off of it. First a few inches here, then a few degrees there, then that thing on a plate and sometimes, I even think back to that painful light. I’m scared. I don’t know what to do, but I know I can’t live in fear of my roommate forever. This Tuesday I’ll confront him. I know God will protect me. And of course, I pray every night that it’s just all in my head.",5,1769887860.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1qsbs7q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qsbs7q,[Infographic] Money 101: Legal Tender vs. Fiat Money (and why the US Dollar rules the world).,"We handle money every day, but most of us get the basic concepts wrong. We think our money is backed by gold (it isn't) and that shops are legally forced to accept our cash (they aren't).
I created these 4 visuals to break down exactly how modern money works. Here is the summary:
Slide 1: The ""Legal Tender"" Myth
 * The Myth: ""If I show cash, you must sell me the item.""
 * The Reality: Legal Tender laws apply strictly to Debts.
 * The Rule: If you are buying a coffee (a new transaction), a shop can refuse cash and ask for card-only. But if you have already eaten a meal (an existing debt), they must accept legal tender to settle that debt.
Slide 2: What is ""Fiat Money""?
 * Your money has no intrinsic value. It is just paper.
 * It is called Fiat Money because ""Fiat"" means ""Decree"" or ""Order.""
 * It has value simply because the Government ordered it to be valuable and we all trust that promise. It is not backed by gold anymore.
Slide 3: Why does the world use US Dollars?
Even though every country has its own Fiat money, the US Dollar is the King. Why?
 * Oil (The Petrodollar): You generally need USD to buy oil on the global market.
 * Trade: It is the ""universal language"" of business.
 * Safety: The US economy is seen as the safest place to store wealth.
Slide 4: The Cheat Sheet
A quick summary table to keep it all straight.
 * Legal Tender = Function (Must be accepted for debts).
 * Fiat Money = Source of Value (Government Order).
Hope this helps clear up the confusion! Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.
TL;DR: Legal tender is for debts, not necessarily shopping. Fiat money is valuable because the Gov says so. The US Dollar rules because of oil and trust.",1,1769887830.0,newarriors,0,1.0,False

1qsbryw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1qsbryw/class_inferiority/,Class inferiority,"I am not sure whether this is universal or uniquely Indian but I’ve noticed that Indians to a greater extent have an inner status ladder that we walk around with and measure everyone with. We are somewhere in the middle of this ladder and those who are up are “higher” and those who are down are “lower” in worth. Ambedkar has said the same about Caste system yet class unlike caste is somewhat fluid, one can move up or down the ladder here.

I have noticed this behavior in myself and in others. Notice the places we feel obliged to wear good shoes or good clothes to, what are these places? What sort of people go to these places? What are the places where you can walk in any attire, and what sort of class inhabits that space?

At one end of the spectrum there is sophistication and at the other end necessities. Why do we spend 300 rupees on a coffee we don’t even like? Why do we have to dress well to drink that coffee? Why do we have to know English to place an order?

A cab driver talks to me with unconditional positive regard, why? Why does my approval matter to him? Does he see me as “higher”? Like I hold other people in high regard and talk to them with extra respect? Am I “lower” than them? Where does this sophistication end, and is it really justified given that we have no control over where we are born, and what ideas we consumed growing up, whether we read HP Lovecraft, Rowling, or Manohar Kahaniya, or didn’t know to read at all?

I sense a growing need in myself and our people to belong to the urban elite, we have sort of internalized this social ranking, caste system of the mind. We somehow feel that this polished upper class is what gets respect and thus we feel perpetually inferior. We perform sophistication, always pretending, always walking with a quiet shame, doing a constant performance to gain approval and belonging.

The success stories of our countries are just people breaking through the class barrier. But what it actually does is lead us to an inauthentic life and perpetuate this mental ladder.

All samples in this tasting are from Jack Daniel’s single barrel offerings. 

**The Competitors**:
1. Heritage Barrel - 100 Proof (my rating 6/10)
2. Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye - 125.6 Proof  (my rating 7/10)
3. Single Barrel Barrel Proof - 135.5 Proof (my rating 7/10)

**Nose**:
1. A lot of banana (I expect this on all) with some barrel char/smoke. Burnt sugar and caramels are in there. Pretty sweet nose, but a lot to it overall. 1.5/2

2. Bit of earthiness, some mint in there. More fruitiness as well, red fruit. There’s still some banana and burnt sugar but just a hint. Less sweet, but a little more to it. 1.4/2

3. Banana fosters bomb. Ton of banana and burnt sugar in there. Really sweet, but some heat to it as well. 1.4/2

**Palate**:
1. Some sweetness upfront, burnt sugar, but is overtaken by some strong oak that lingers throughout. There’s a kind of smoky/burnt taste to it that lingers throughout 4/5

2. Sweet up front, caramelized sugar takes center stage. The banana comes through a bit, but again more of an afterthought. Mid palate is oak forward. The mint note kind of lingered throughout here. 4.3/5

3. The bananas foster/burnt sugar really comes through strong again. You start to get some oak influence on the mid palate but overall a really sweet pour. 4.5/5

**Finish**:
1. Some smoky heat comes through right away. The oak  shows up as the main tasting note, really recoating the palate. 2.2/3

2. Not overly hot but there is a lot of spice! Once it fades there’s some sweetness to it. It’s a great finish overall that lasts a while. 2.5/3

3. Definitely the most interesting of the bunch. The heat really showed up strong, along with some nuttiness. There were hints of coffee and oak mixed in as well. 2/3

**Results**: 
**3rd Place** - Sample 1 - 7.7/10 - Heritage
**2nd Place** - Sample 3 - 7.9//10 - SBBP
**1st Place** - Sample 2 - 8.2/10 - SBBP Rye

**Thoughts**: I’ve done several tasting before, some curated but never blind, so this is a first. I do think my nose and palate were fried by the end which is why I got some of the weird notes in there. I’m not surprised the rye won, it’s definitely the most complete of the bunch. Biggest surprise was the finish on the SBBP, but I’m attributing that to the fried palate. All three are great bottles in my opinion and I will definitely be keeping them all in stock. 

There are some drawbacks to this, I’ll often write up my reviews over two tastings which allows me to really know the pour. In this set up, I hamstrung myself to what was in the glass, so some of the more intricate notes weren’t easily found. Overall, this was really fun and eye opening. Might need to try some bottles truly blind, to see how it affects the outcome. Lastly, my wife shuffled (technically didn’t actually do anything besides slide the bottles back and forth) the pours for me, so little shout out to her.",20,1769886302.0,bourbon,7,0.95,False

1qsayla,https://i.redd.it/m0jisqwn9qgg1.jpeg,Timmy's Bagel & Coffee - 2834 Markham Rd (Large - $6.99),"Noticed this store listed yesterday on the app so decided to try it. Ordered yesterday evening for a pick-up of a Large and Medium bag today at 11:00AM-12:00PM. (I decided only to add a picture of the Large order as the Medium was in multiple small bags so it would be a hassle to arrange them for a picture. The medium was almost all plain bagels and 3 muffins

  
Story time. This will be a long one....

I arrived at the store around 11:08AM and there was a lady picking up a small order from the app. The worker was preparing her order but he was anxious. He kept pausing and overall moving very slowly. Eventually realized it was his first time preparing a TGTG order. He also mentioned to me later on he only works 1 day and hadn't worked since prior to the new year.

He kept pacing around nervously trying to pack her order. I thought he was eventually done because he asked me what I wanted. Told him I was here for a pick-up of large and medium off the app. He became nervous and told me he had to call his boss as he had no idea what to pack for the medium or small order. At some point he eventually finished packing the small order for the customer prior to me. At this point approximately 10mins had passed.

He tried to contact the boss but he was unresponsive. There was another dine-in customer he was trying to prepare their order for and was struggling with that as well. The boss eventually called back and told the worker he wanted to see pictures of my orders. I agreed to this. Another worker which I assume was the cook kept coming in and out trying to help. He had no idea as well.

Eventually the worker started packing my Large order which he packed a Chicken Leg with rice and Shepherds Pie with rice. These were valued at $7.99 each. He was going to add bagels to the order to meet the $21 value.  I mentioned to him the Large was stated to be a lunch item but told him to go ahead because at this point I just wanted to leave. He added 2 bagels. 

As he was packing the orders we were talking and he mentioned I thought this would be end of day at 1-2pm (they close at 2pm) and he would pack left-over items. I told him whoever listed the items on the app they must have put the wrong timeframe 11am-12pm. I also mentioned that all 3 Small, Medium and Large were sold out on the app and I believe they were 3x each. He was shocked. I observed not much food remaining except bagels. 

I told him just to finish the dine-in customers orders as they seemed to be waiting quite sometime as well. The dine-in customers were nice and told him to finish my order

He started packing my medium order and I mentioned the medium order stated it was for bagels and muffins. He thought it didn't matter and only had to meet the $18 price. He packed it with nearly all plain bagels until I mentioned variety would be nice and added 2 muffins and other bagels.

  
After 30-40mins I had my order and left. I tried the food at home and both the chicken and shepherds pie were meh. The bagels were large but were just average imo. I'll try reheating them and hopefully they are better.

  
Overall was not satisfied as it took a tremendous amount of time. I can understand it was their first time but luckily I had nowhere urgent to be. The quality of what I received was just below average imo. Won't be going back.

I quit caffeine for about 2 weeks, I drank energy drinks for several years a day, sometimes every other day. Sometimes I drank 1 Hell energy drink and sometimes two. I do strength training 3 times a week, I also use pre-workout supplements with caffeine, so sometimes on the day of training I took a pre-workout supplement before training and then an energy drink during the day. A week after quitting, I woke up in the morning, my heart was racing, after a while it stopped. Then I went to training and after the pre-workout it caught up with me again. Then came the stress, fear for my life, that I would die. I am 27 years old. During the week it happened to me again, my heart rate jumped to about 135 bpm, chaos, stress. I called the ambulance, they took me to the hospital where they did an ECG 2 times, took blood. All the tests were always fine, no sign of disease or heart damage, no heart attack, nothing. The doctor said that it was not a life-threatening condition, that my heart was completely fine. The longest I was in this state was about 40 minutes. Then I found this article and a discussion with you, that some of you subsequently switched to coffee. So I started drinking coffee, one and maximum two a day. I feel that it has improved since then, but sometimes I have cold hands, I still sweat, a few days ago I had another symptom that it was coming on to me, but since I already know that I will not die, that it is not a heart attack, I tried not to notice it so much and after a while it went away. So I would like to ask you, do any of you have such experiences, how long can this last and whether you also had tests that were completely fine and you had to figure out yourself that it must be caffeine. How to properly handle it, get rid of it and stop being afraid and stressed about it? Thank you very much for the answers.",1,1769885723.0,caffeinewithdrawal,0,1.0,False

In my youth, McDonald's and the other fast food chains seemed a lot more saturated and joyous. This was until it became glaringly obvious that it wasn't just children who were ignorant to nutrition, and they collectively received a sterile makeover. In the 1950s, snack kiosques were faced with a terrible conundrum. People were too afraid to go back for seconds, as it made them feel piggish. So, cinemas across the contiguous United States adopted the practice of offering larger portions. This way, more money could be milked from the hungry consumer, who in turn feels less self conscious about their gluttony. Much to Behemah's delight, this practice soon spread far and wide. Today, you can supersize your already corpulent meals for pennies to the dollar. I first heard of this when I was a small child, and begged my mother to bring me to the nearest off-brand McDonald's. A wage-weary single parent, she needed rest as much as I needed sugar and fat, and so she finally relented to my car-seat kicking. 

She pulled the ‘95 Camry into the drab parking lot outside our town's one splash of color. I leapt from my booster seat, and my mother struggled to keep up with me as I ran to the front door of the fast food joint. Inside, I was greeted by everything a six year old boy could ever want, as well as the smell of grease and sweat. Every surface was a rainbow vomit of color, and sticky to the touch. Plastic nightmares of commercial mascots littered the place, making it seem more crowded than it actually was. Half of the building was occupied by padded seats and messy tables, with the other half having succumbed to a massive tangle of slides and climbing beams. It was the sacred play area. I had heard talk of it since kindergarten, but never thought I'd see it first hand. My hunger quickly faded as the new apple of my eye became the play place. Still, I followed my mother to the counter and ordered a large kids meal. It arrived at our table, according to my childlike perception of time, in seconds. My mother sipped tentatively at her coffee as I wolfed my creep feed. Soon, every scrap of processed potato and beef was gone, and my mother reluctantly let me loose in the play place. 

It was a jungle of oddly smelling padded beams and rope mesh, and I felt similarly to an early explorer venturing into the Amazon. 
I felt a buzz as I kicked off my shoes and slid them into the nearby box rack. Soon after, I fell to my hands and knees and hurried through the first tunnel. After passing the threshold, my memories become a blur. The exact layout of the play place is a mystery to me still, as it was back then. As a child, it gives you a strange sense of independence. Your entire life, all you've known is the watchful eye of an adult. Be it your guardian at home, or your teachers at school. This was, like for many children, my first experience of evading either. It felt like I'd slipped into another dimension, one where children populate a technicolor labyrinth and parents are a myth. 

I crawled through the plastic tunnels, high on the thrill of autonomy. Half a dozen other children hurried around, above and below me. I saw their shapes through gaps in the padded beams, and behind the mesh and ropes. I made a mental note of where I came from, fearful of getting lost never to be found. It dawned on me that no adult would fit through these tightest squeezes, and I didn't trust my fellow hatchlings to carry out their duties. I descended through square foam rungs, each missing an alternating quarter. Everywhere had the funk of socks and encrusted puke in difficult to clean areas. I carried on, however, right to the bowels of the beast. That's what the play place felt like at times. It was as if I'd swapped realities with the burger and fries I'd just devoured, and was now being digested. After climbing down another tunnel, I reached the stomach. Suddenly, an ocean of brightly colored plastic spheres appeared before me. Like impatient Death waiting on an indecisive suicidal, it begged me to jump. And I did. I leapt from the mouth of the tube and submerged myself in the ball pit. 

“Hey, this is our spot!” A nasally voice whined. 

Once I resurfaced, I looked around for its source. Two kids huddled in the corner of the pit, stacking balls into their upturned shirts, intent on bringing some home. Their black, greasy hair matched, as did the rest of them. They were twins. 

“Can't we share?” I replied. 

The two horrid kids thought in silence, before giving their final judgement.

“No!”

But they couldn't make me leave. Even when they started throwing balls at me, I relished in the volley. After submerging myself in the pit, and reappearing in the opposing corner, I took up arms and started throwing balls back. A war soon erupted, but quickly faded as two more explorers of the play place arrived via slide. Pigtails and skirt, I realized in shock. It was an affront, an injustice. If I didn't let girls in my tree house, I certainly wouldn't have them anywhere near my ball pit. Yet I remained too terrified to speak my truths, and became a package of meekness. The other two had the same such reaction, but were more vocal. 

“Ew, get out!” they said, almost in unison, “this is our spot!”

“Shut up Randy!” Pigtails screamed.

Acquaintances?

“That's a bad word, yuck-face!” Randy, or possibly his brother, retorted. 

This tête-à-tête continued for some time. I noticed Skirt, the younger of the two girls, cowering behind Pigtails. Her eyes were wide, wider than I'd ever seen, and I decided to wade across to her. 

“Want to be friends?” I asked, sucking up my antagonising attitude. 

She shook her head rapidly. Well, that was that. I turned to wade back to my spot, only to find someone new occupying it. Another boy, a little older and a little weaker, who'd arrived from the same direction I had. The ball pit was getting crowded, and the new kid realized. For that reason, he sat silently back on the rim of the tunnel and watched the scene play out in front of him. The conflict between the twins and Pigtails was getting heated, and Skirt had overcome her fear and jumped in to defend her friend. A glanced over my shoulder at the new kid, who looked at me then looked away. We both went back to watching the fight. It reminded me of the stuff my mom would watch on TV during her wine hour. Waves of plastic balls crashed with every movement, as did the ones that'd be repurposed into ammo. It was fun to watch for a while, but my gaze soon began to drift. Rarely did a ball-pit ever come stocked with a black variant, which is why the sudden flash of the color was so striking. I stared long and hard at where I thought I'd seen the darkness, until it became visible again. I locked onto it, but it took me a while to realise what it was. When I did, I screamed, silencing the conflict around me. It was a person, or something just less. I could only see the top half of their face, that peered at me half emerged from the ball-pit, occupying the one childless corner. At the sound of my scream, it dipped back under the surface. 

“What's wrong?” Pigtails asked, genuinely concerned. 

I mouthed a response, but no real words followed. Had I really seen what I thought I saw? The answer, quite quickly, was proven to be ‘yes’. After one short minute of trying to explain myself, the thing emerged fully from beneath the ocean-deep mass of colored balls. 

It had the shape of a man, or something adjacent. Its body was moist and pitch black, like how a tar road sweats on a hot day. Encrusted into its flesh were various lost items, from friendship bracelets to food scraps to socks. All were coated in a dark black-green slime, and were slowly being dissolved. Its nose was long and pointed, and its grin was doubly wide. The thing's sunken eyes were its most human feature. Milk white without color, they still managed to exude emotion. As I stared, a strange comfort washed over me. Judging from the reactions, or the lack thereof, from the people around me, I could tell they were under the same affect. The new guest kept rising from the pit of balls until the papier-mâchè crown on his head dinked against the foam ceiling. He towered over us and bent forward, blotting out the cracks of artificial light like a humanoid eclipse. Once he extended fully, he smiled and spoke. 

“Well what do we have here?” The thing said, extending his left arm. 

He ran his hand through one of the twins’ hair, leaving a sticky mess behind. We looked at him in awe, mostly. I was so fixated that I didn't notice the older boy behind me crawl off back down the tunnel in fright. The thing spoke again, after a while of silence while his eyes flitted between us. 

“I am the Ball Pit King. What are your names?” He asked, his smile growing wider for a micro instant before returning back to its former, still unnatural, width. 

His movements were janky, like every few frames were missing. Still, we collectively ignored the obvious threat to life and limb and went around the horn, introducing ourselves. 

“Randy,” said one of the twins. 

“Andy,” said the other. Naturally. 

“Clare,” said Pigtails. 

“Lillian,” said Skirt, her voice breaking slightly as she did.

“Josh,” I said, lying. I wasn't sure if the others had too. 

“Well, it is lovely to meetcha!” The Ball Pit King said. 

His voice was whiny and breathless, and he panted heavily between bursts of speech. He reminded me of this kid at school who had to wear a necklace with an inhaler dangling on the end of it. For a moment, it seemed he was just here to watch us play. Then he noticed Randy, who still had half a dozen plastic balls bunched up in his folded t-shirt. The Ball Pit King locked his eyes onto the child, and began to tut. 

“You should know you're not allowed to take those home with you. You do know that, don't you?” 

“Yes,” Randy stuttered out after a few failed attempts. 

“Drop them,” the King said, his voice now coated in the authority of an adult. 

Randy did just that, letting them tumble back into the pit. The King smiled, and spoke with his previous whimsical tone. 

“Good boy,” he said, his hand of rot distending to cup Randy's cheek.

“It'd be selfish of me to hoard all these beautiful balls while all you kiddies went without, wouldn't it?” The Ball Pit King asked. 

We were all too afraid to answer verbally, but Clare managed a reluctant nod.

“Well then, let's see what we can do about that,” the man of sludge said. 

Suddenly, his chest convulsed. It looked like an inflamed Adam's apple had dislocated, and started rising up his throat. The swell moved slowly upwards with a slick squeak, until it entered the King's mouth with a wet pop. He pursed his lips, then opened wide. A blue ball appeared between his teeth. He reached in and plucked it out, a long string of slime trailing behind it. He handed the black stained ball to Clare. She dropped it immediately, forcing the Ball Pit King to give her this look. It reminded me of the look my mom's special friend had given me when I came home from school a few months ago. A look that was stuck in my mind from how much it frightened me. Hate. Clare seemed to physically get smaller when she met those sunken eyes, and shrank down to pick up the ball. One by one, the King choked up another plastic ball, then another again, until we'd all received his gift. Mine was moist, and warm to the touch. It was also green, my favourite color. 

Then the Ball Pit King turned to Randy. He was the only one of us yet to receive a gift, although he didn't seem too bothered by that fact. 

“Now how could I forget little Randy,” the fetid man said, sliding his finger down the boy's button nose and leaving a snail trail of grime. 

His gullet began to splutter once more. It sounded more pained this time, like biological engine trouble. The ball tore up the King's throat, leaving sagging ‘skin’ where the bulge had been. What before was a wet pop now sounded more like calcified pus tearing out of a fistula. Slowly, the Ball Pit King's smile grew wider, almost bisecting his head. I shook with fear as he opened his mouth wide, revealing the plastic ball perched on his tongue, hemmed in by a picket fence of seventy human teeth. Some of them, I noticed, were milk teeth. It looked like a brightly saturated red pearl found within a dead clam. 

“Take… it” The Ball Pit King said with great difficulty. 

Snot ran down Randy's nose, accompanied by tears from his eyes. Down south, piss dribbled from within the hem of his khaki shorts. The Ball Pit King's mouth was nearing a ninety degree angle, to the point where he was staring at the ceiling without needing to move his neck. Although he couldn't see Randy, the terrified boy acted as if the King's eyes were trepanning his skull. Slowly, his fragile arm reached forward to grab the plastic ball, intent on ending this childhood-scarring altercation as quickly as possible. Black, viscous saliva dripped from the roof of the Ball Pit King's mouth, and from the rows of sharp, hadal-like teeth that had been concealed behind their human counterparts. Randy's hand caressed the plastic orb, and attempted to pluck it from the fleshy pedestal. Throat meat clung to the ball, keeping it in place. Randy tugged harder, and finally popped it from the socket it had grown out of. That's when the King struck. 

His mouth closed like a bear trap on a rabbit. Randy's shoulder splintered as his arm detached from the rest of him. Now severed, the boy fell backwards, becoming half submerged in plastic balls. His brother screamed, as did the two girls, who all rushed past me and into the tunnel. The Ball Pit King's throat distended again as he swallowed. Crying, I watched as Randy was dragged down, disappearing beneath the multicolored surface, likely by one of the King's subjects. I clambered into the yellow tunnel then, looking back to see the Ball Pit King begin to sink alongside the child. The top half of his head was the only part now visible, with sunken white eyes that fixated on me. 

The dreamworld of the playplace became a nightmare hellscape of tunnels, foam and rope, as the three of us made our way out. Every turn, I expected to see the King again, but was greeted only with the legs of the kid crawling frantically in front of me. The four of us emerged, finding the older child had stopped attempting to drag a crowd of adults to the play area. We ran crying to our parents, and my mother hurried me to the car before any mention of the Ball Pit King could be uttered through our tears. The police eventually did come to my door as Randy was declared a missing child. To the officer's confusion, I put forward the same explanation as the other four juvenile witnesses. Randy was never seen again, but a shoe belonging to him was found in a service station play area the next state over. That was 1999, and no new evidence has ever come to light. 

Today, the off-brand fast food place remains where it was. It managed to stay open for another month and a half after Randy's disappearance, before shutting its doors for good. No local developers wanted to touch that property, and so it grows more derelict with every passing year. Its bright facade, a relic of 90's fast food culture, has faded into muted tones. Now grey, it reflects joints the country over. The only vibrance comes from the foliage growing throughout the building, and the graffiti that paints its walls. It was a popular hang-out stop for teens until the disappearances in 2021. The abandonment spread like a tumor, with that restaurant as its center. Now, most of the buildings around it lay in a similar state of ruin, as the town's local economy collapsed from Covid. I remain, however. The action I'm about to commit is borne from a decision I've been contemplating for over twenty years. With my gun and my camera, and my snatched bait, I will finally prove to the world my ultimate truth. Something that has left me branded as a liar for my entire life. Reddit, wish me luck.

I’ve been working since I was 14 years old, I started working on a dinner riverboat and held that job steady every season (march-November) until shortly after I turned 19. When I was 16 and could finally drive myself places, I got another job as a barista at a local coffee shop and worked there and the riverboat. I left for college, but would come back every other weekend to work. Absolutely loved that job, so once I moved, I continued to work as a barista at a different job, worked my way up, became the manager, and held that job for a little over 3 years and was serving/bartending at night at a huge bar as well. I’ve had a couple other part time jobs as well when there were slower seasons as well just to keep my income phat the way I like it. Fast forward I moved to Knoxville tn with my boyfriend and I had a job as a barista, but that didn’t last long and got fired because I was “working too many hours” when the manager and OWNER were the ones allowing me to pick up extra shifts, work at their roastery AND go make sales calls with new clients, so getting fired was very out of the blue and there were no signs leading up to it. I’ve worked retail, food service, blue collar jobs, and sales positions in the past and that’s all on my resume. It’s been almost 2 weeks now, and I cannot find a job for the life of me. I’ve been to temp services, but I need to be making a minimum of $20 an hour and I’ll take any work, but NONE OF THEM offer jobs that pay that well unless you have a college degree or a CDL. I have been applying on indeed and in person at places, I’ve been taking 2 hours every morning to put in job apps and 1 hour after that to drive to restaurants, ask if they’re hiring, and hand my resume in in person. I’ve probably done 15 interviews at this point and nobody wants me and I do not understand this shit. I just got rejected by Amazon for a delivery position when I had a great interview and a clean driving record. Who gets rejected by Amazon??? My resume and reference list clearly show I have a great work ethic, and every interview I’ve had I feel has gone very well. And it’s not like I’m applying to be a rocket scientist of anything, just jobs like bartenders, servers, factory workers, package delivery services, entry level shit like that because I’m a college dropout and can only do so much.

1qsalxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNtelligence/comments/1qsalxn/south_african_student_reacts_to_big_anthropic/,South African Student Reacts to Big Anthropic News: $20B Raise and ServiceNow Deal,"Hey ArtificialNtelligence! Cape Townian here. Just woke up to some wild AI updates, and honestly? Still half asleep, but this news is insane. Let’s break it down together, because wow.



Quick time check: it’s 20:33 in South Africa, January 31, 2026. While you folks in the US are probably sipping your morning coffee, I’m juggling economics notes and fiddling with Claude Code. Student life is no joke!



Here’s what’s got my head spinning: Anthropic just raised a jaw-dropping $20 billion in their latest funding round. Seriously—twenty billion dollars. Not a typo. TechCrunch says they doubled their goal because investors are throwing money at them like it’s a party. That puts their valuation at $350 billion. That’s bigger than some national economies! Absolute madness.



But wait, there’s more. ServiceNow—the software company your parents’ offices might use—just announced a massive partnership with Anthropic. Basically, Anthropic’s Claude models are now powering all of ServiceNow’s workflow AI tools. Claude is the brains behind their main AI agent builder, ServiceNow Build Agent. Plus, ServiceNow is rolling out Claude access to all 29,000 employees. That’s like handing an entire city a superpowered AI. And their engineers are using Claude Code too, which, if you haven’t checked it out, is actually amazing.



Now, let’s talk about what this means for us in South Africa. I dug up a Boston Consulting Group report, and guess what: Africa leads the world in AI workforce readiness. For real—55% of our workforce is already upskilled in AI, putting us at number one globally. Wild, right?



Here’s the thing, though: all these massive enterprise deals sound impressive, but what about students? It’s cool that African CEOs are hustling to build AI skills, but I’m still waiting for internships or entry-level jobs that don’t require five years’ experience. The report says African companies are putting almost half their AI budgets into upskilling and retraining, so there’s some hope. I just wish more of those chances actually came to us, not just the ones already established.



Honestly, I went from hyped (like, $20B could fix our whole healthcare system!) to a bit frustrated. So much cash is going to US companies, and I can’t help but wonder when we’ll actually get access to these tools. I’m all for the AI revolution, but I want to see African startups building with this tech, not just watching from the sidelines.



There is a silver lining: 82% of African CEOs say they’re the main AI decision-makers at their companies, which is the highest in the world. So maybe we’re moving in the right direction.



Bottom line: this is massive for AI, but for us in South Africa, it’s another reason to keep pushing. We’re leading on paper, but doors need to open for students and young people—not just fancy stats.



Anthropic and ServiceNow are making major moves. When the AI wave finally hits here, I want to be riding it—not just watching from the beach.



What do you all think? Is this the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for, or just Silicon Valley making noise while we wait our turn? Share your thoughts—I’m listening.",1,1769885228.0,ArtificialNtelligence,1,1.0,False

One game turned into three. Three turned into “one more, this comp is hilarious.” Chat filled with pings, bad decisions, clutch snowballs, and laughter typed in all caps. Somewhere between a miracle pentakill and a very questionable engage, new names stuck around. Strangers stopped being strangers. Someone said, “same time tomorrow?” and meant it.

Outside, winter had loosened its grip. Inside Howling Abyss, chaos reigned—as it should. No longer snowed in. Snowballing again... if this sounds like you adventurer, join me, and others, and snowball into the abyss!",1,1769885224.0,LeagueConnect,0,1.0,False

1qsajmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Odd_Sorbet4464/comments/1qsajmd/i_found_a_wristwatch_in_the_forest_and_realized/,I found a wristwatch in the forest and realized too late what the ticking was spelling out. Part 3,"Opening the box, I braced myself for something horrible.  
Bones. Old photographs. Another watch.  
Something that would finally make all of this feel… logical, in a twisted way.

Instead, there was only a single folded note.

It lay in the center of the box like it had been waiting there for years. The paper was slightly yellowed, but the fold was sharp, almost too clean. For a few seconds I just stared at it, hoping there was another compartment, something hidden underneath.

There wasn’t.

I picked it up. The paper felt cold against my fingers, colder than the air in the cabin. I unfolded it and saw four words, written in large, shaky letters:

“BRING MY WATCH BACK!”

The handwriting was ugly, crooked, like someone writing with the wrong hand… or with fingers that didn’t bend the way they should.

The second I finished reading, the forest woke up.

Wind slammed into the cabin so violently that the walls shuddered. Branches scraped and hammered against the roof like claws. The lid of the box snapped shut on its own under my hands with a sharp crack, and at the same time the door behind me slammed so hard the whole frame rattled.

I flinched and dropped the note. It slipped from my fingers and skittered across the floor.

For a moment the air went heavy and still. My ears rang. Then, just at the edge of my vision, something moved.

A dark silhouette passed by the window.

Not a clear human shape. Too tall, too thin, stretched in the wrong directions, like a shadow cast by the wrong kind of light. It was there for less than a second, gliding past the glass, and then it was gone.

My body moved before my brain did. I grabbed the note without even realizing it, yanked the door open and ran outside.

The clearing looked empty.  
But far between the trees, deeper in the forest, I saw it again — that tall, narrow shape sliding between the trunks. It didn’t move like a person running. It moved like something being pulled.

Then it vanished, swallowed by the trees.

That was the moment it finally hit me: my mistake wasn’t opening the box.  
My mistake was picking up the watch on that first day.

I ran.

I don’t really remember the way back. Just branches hitting my arms, my lungs burning, and that ugly, animal panic chewing through my thoughts. Every time I heard a crack behind me, every time a shadow shifted at the edge of my vision, I sped up. I didn’t stop until the trees thinned and the distant sounds of cars and people reached me again.

By the time I got home, my hands were shaking so hard I almost dropped my keys.

The next few days blurred together. I didn’t leave the apartment. I told my boss I was sick and needed to stay home. Technically, that wasn’t a lie. I couldn’t stand the idea of walking past the line of trees outside my building, past the little patch of woods behind the parking lot.

The watch lay on my table.  
Exactly where it had always been.

It ticked and stuttered without stopping, the second hand jerking forward and back, forward and back. I knew it was still spelling out the same Morse code, even when I covered it with a towel, even when I went to another room. I could almost hear the pattern in my head:

“He is looking for me.  
He knows I found this.  
He knows you did too.  
He is already in the trees.  
He is closer now.”

I barely slept. I barely ate. I walked circles through my apartment and kept glancing at the table, terrified that one day I’d look and it wouldn’t be there — or that it would be somewhere else. Closer.

On the third or fourth day (I honestly lost track), something snapped.

I was done being afraid of a piece of metal.

In a burst of anger that felt more like desperation, I grabbed the watch from the table, threw my window open, and hurled it out as hard as I could. I didn’t watch where it landed. I just heard a dull clatter somewhere below and slammed the window shut.

For the first time in days, there was silence.

No ticking.  
No stuttering second hand.  
Just the faint noise of the street and my own breathing.

I stood there for a long time, hands still on the window frame, waiting for something to happen. When nothing did, when the silence kept stretching and stretching, I did the only thing that made sense.

I called Dima.

I hadn’t planned on telling him *everything*. But the moment I heard his voice, it all came spilling out — the cabin, the box, the note that said “BRING MY WATCH BACK!”, the dark silhouette at the window. I talked too fast, jumping from detail to detail, like someone trying to empty a burning house with their hands.

He didn’t interrupt. Just listened.

Then he said he was coming over.

When he arrived, he looked more worried than skeptical. He brought tea and chocolate like I was a normal sick person and not someone ranting about haunted timepieces and invisible things in the trees. He sat at my table — the same table where the watch had been — and made me go through the story again, slower this time.

He tried to ground it.  
He said forests are scary even when nothing supernatural is going on. That our brains are great at turning shadows into monsters. That some bored jerk might’ve left the note in the box years ago as a joke. That maybe I connected too many coincidences because I was exhausted.

He didn’t call me crazy.  
He didn’t say it was all in my head.

He just kept reminding me that my mind *could* be making it worse than it was.

And it actually helped.  
Little by little, the tightness in my chest loosened. The apartment felt less like a trap and more like four normal walls again. By the time he stood up to leave, I wasn’t exactly fine, but I felt… survivable.

Right before he walked out, he turned back and asked:

“Are you sure the watch is gone?”

“I threw it out the window,” I said. “I don’t even know where it landed.”

He shrugged. “Good. Then if it was just some messed up gadget, it’s probably in pieces now.”

We said goodbye, and for the first time in a while, I went to bed without that sinking feeling in my stomach.

That night, I slept.

No ticking. No whispering wind around the building. No dreams I can remember. Just heavy, normal sleep.

In the morning, everything felt almost… boring. I woke up, grabbed my phone, scrolled through dumb news and memes, went to the kitchen and made coffee. For a few blessed minutes, the last weeks felt like something distant and foggy, like a bad movie I’d watched too late at night.

I sat down at the table with my mug and my phone.

And then I looked up.

The cup slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor, hot coffee splashing over my bare feet.

The watch was back on the table.

Exactly where it had always been.

Next to it, lying perfectly flat, was the same piece of paper I’d found in the box. Only now it was unfolded, and I could already see that the text had changed.

My legs felt like they didn’t belong to me, but I forced myself to move. I stepped around the broken pieces of the cup and stopped at the edge of the table.

The handwriting on the note was the same jagged, crooked mess. The original words — “BRING MY WATCH BACK!” — had been crossed out with thick, angry strokes. Underneath, in the same ugly hand, a new line had been added:

“HE IS ALREADY CLOSE.”

My first thought was that it didn’t make sense.  
Close to what? To the forest? To the cabin? To me?

My second thought never fully formed. The room tilted sideways and rushed up at me.

When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the floor. My head throbbed. The coffee had dried in sticky streaks on the tiles. For a second I thought I’d imagined everything, that the watch and the note had just been part of some half‑dream.

Then I sat up and saw the table.

The watch was gone.  
The note was gone.

In their place, right in the center of the table, there was something else.

A small, square photograph.

One of those instant film photos with the white border. I don’t own a camera like that. I don’t print photos of myself. But there I was, frozen on glossy paper, asleep in my own bed.

The photo was taken from somewhere near my bedroom door, angled just enough to show my whole body under the blanket. My hair sprawled across the pillow. My arm hanging off the edge of the bed.

The worst part wasn’t that.

The worst part was the window behind me.

In the picture, the curtain was slightly open. Just enough to show the dark line of trees outside. And between those trees, almost perfectly centered in the narrow gap, was something tall and darker than the rest of the shadows.

I turned the photo over with shaking hands.

On the back, in the same jagged handwriting as the note, were two words:

“NOT YET.”

That’s it. That’s where I am now.

The watch isn’t on my table. The note is gone.  
All I have is this photo and the memory of a voice I’ve never heard, saying words I’ve only ever read.

“He is already close.”

I don’t know if I should move.  
I don’t know if it would even matter.

I just know that every night, when the wind picks up and the leaves outside my building start to move, I hear a sound I can’t explain.

Like a second hand.  
Ticking.  
Waiting.

I have a bigger forehead and receding hairline. I sport a low buzzcut and own it as confidently as I can. I’m fit, dress well, and decent career.

But I can’t deny the facts - when I’m wearing a hat in public (which isn’t very often), I receive undeniably more interest in females (eye contact, etc.). It’s a night and day difference, I promise you.

The thing is, I rarely wear hats, and when I do, I have this internal rule not to hit on women because I NEVER want to hatfish. Recently, I encountered a girl in a coffee shop that was my perfect type. That day it was bloody cold, so I had a beanie on. She couldn’t stop making eye contact, and even gave me an obvious window to talk to her when her friend stepped away. I didn’t take it. It kills me, but I’d bet if I wasn’t wearing a beanie, that encounter wouldn’t have happened in the first place.

My question is, should I continue with my internal rule not to hatfish and only approach when I don’t have a hat on (majority of the time) if an opp does present itself? Or should I take the chance anyways in these situations, and if I get their number, etc. just be honest with them prior to any arranged date letting them know I was wearing a hat (here’s what I look like without one blah blah) & I understand if they’re no longer interested?",1,1769884994.0,dating_advice,10,0.6,False

Rather, it’s likely that some of the other members hinted or told Taeheon that Jobu was interested in Taeheon right from the start of the show even before Taeheon arrived. That was a well known fact to the other contestants, because of how open Jobu was about it to other contestants like William, Izaya and Ryuki. Taeheon was unaware of that, and in his confessional after their awkward first coffee after their shift, he mentioned he had no idea why Jobu even invited him if Jobu hardly spoke during their first coffee. Contestants invited others to join them for the work shift for all kinds of reasons (Ryota inviting Gensei, Kazuto inviting Shun, Ryuki inviting Jobu), not necessarily romantic.

Taeheon probably didn’t know how Jobu was feeling before and during that coffee, heard from another contestant what Jobu said about him, initiated contact by sitting behind him on the couch to test the waters, both agreed to a date and Jobu tested the waters again by asking to put his head on Taeheon’s lap. And when Taeheon asked for the same, the next morning Jobu asked to join Taeheon under the sheets.

So it was really a series of tests with escalating levels of intimacy to see if the other party would reciprocate. The observations by Taeheon (which I mentioned in the first paragraph above) didn’t really address the question he had of whether Jobu was into him, only the question of how safe Jobu is.",9,1769884954.0,theBoyfriendNetflix,6,0.91,False

In moments like this, I realize that there is nothing about which to complain, I observe more than anything my brain searching, unruly like a child who cannot sit still. I worry, too: I attach myself to the certainty of change, the dissolution of happiness and the likelihood of a downturn.

Yet that also is only a thought, unreal, and I find myself wondering if being content is not also a kind of being adrift, or of letting oneself be adrift, the ceding of control as one chaos bleeds into another.

But other times, it’s just awkward small talk that dies after, “So what do you do?” Most of us crave deeper convos, especially in a world obsessed with curated IG stories and endless scrolling. Real connection feels rare. But it’s not just luck. Some questions actually pull authenticity out of people.



That’s what this post is about: how to skip the social fluff and ask questions that spark real connection fast. These are curated from books on human behavior, research-backed social psychology, and yes, even the most viral podcasts and interviews. Because let’s be real: TikTok advice like “just be confident” doesn’t do much when you're actually out there trying to vibe with someone at a party or over coffee.



And no, you don’t need to be naturally charismatic. Connection is a skill, and asking the right questions fast-tracks emotional closeness.



Here’s what works (backed by science and not influencer BS):





 ""What’s something that’s been on your mind a lot lately?""  

  This opens the emotional door without sounding too invasive. It taps into current mental real estate and shows curiosity.  

  Dr. Arthur Aron’s famous “36 Questions” study (1997, Stony Brook University) found that asking personal but not-too-intense questions early on builds closeness quickly. This kind of prompt outperforms generic small talk.



 ""What’s something you used to believe that you no longer do?""  

  This uncovers values, growth, and personal change. It also makes people reflect, which triggers deeper sharing.  

   In the “Hidden Brain” podcast by Shankar Vedantam, cognitive scientists explain how discussing personal change increases vulnerability, which makes people feel safer around you.



 ""What’s one small decision that ended up changing your life?""  

  This question feels reflective but not loaded. It often reveals major life events wrapped in subtle choices.  

   According to behavioral economist Dan Ariely, we overestimate the impact of big choices and underestimate small ones. Talking about these “micro” turning points brings up rich stories.



 ""When do you feel most like yourself?""  

  This flips the usual “what do you do?” to something identity-centered. People love to talk about who they really are.  

   Dr. Brené Brown’s research on vulnerability shows that authenticity builds trust faster than achievement-talk.



 ""What’s a hill you’re willing to die on?""  

  It’s light but also meaningful. This often leads to playful debates or surprisingly deep beliefs.  

   The team at Farnam Street Podcast emphasizes that exploring someone’s strong opinions fast-forwards rapport by revealing core values, and creates memorable convos.



 ""What kind of kid were you growing up?""  

  This taps into nostalgia and identity. It reveals someone’s inner story, and almost always leads to laughs or meaningful stuff.  

   In The Like Switch by ex-FBI agent Jack Schafer, childhood memories are powerful bonding tools. They bypass surface identity and dig into origin stories.



 ""What’s something you wish more people understood about you?""  

  This question hits intimate territory but gives total control. People can go shallow or deep.  

   Psychology Today reports that self-disclosure is one of the fastest paths to closeness, but only when it feels invited, not forced.



 ""What’s your go-to ‘comfort’ TV show or movie?""  

  This is low-stakes but tells you about their emotional habits and core tastes.  

   According to a 2022 Nielsen report, rewatch behavior reveals psychological needs like safety, identity, and emotional regulation.



 ""When was the last time you felt totally at peace?""  

  It gently opens the door to emotional self-awareness.  

   In Andrew Huberman’s podcast, he explains how talking about peaceful states activates parasympathetic responses that calm both people in a conversation. You literally feel safer around someone when you talk about peace.



 ""If you weren’t doing what you're doing now, what would you be doing?""  

  Everyone has a secret life they imagine. This pulls out dreams, regrets, or hidden ambitions.  

   In Range by David Epstein, he argues the most interesting people often live “portfolio lives,” with 3–4 different dream paths inside them.





These aren’t magical phrases. They're social shortcuts. What works isn’t just what you ask but how you ask. Come with curiosity, not interrogation.



And yes, practice helps. These convos get easier the more you use them.

# Introduction

Globally, people with tremors in their hands, legs, or head that resemble Essential Tremor (ET) are overwhelmingly misdiagnosed. Up to 99 percent of physicians do not recognize that Lyme disease, Bartonella, and Babesia can cause neurological symptoms that mimic ET, including tremors that improve with alcohol, worsen with caffeine, and fluctuate with stress.

Even physicians who know about these infections often avoid treating them, fearing professional or legal consequences. This leaves patients untreated, misdiagnosed, and often sent to psychiatrists.

This book documents patient experiences, clinical pathways, and scientific evidence, showing how chronic infections collide with the medical system like a train hitting a wall.

# Chapter 1 — How Infection-Related Tremors Appear

Key characteristics of infection-related tremors:

* Present primarily during movement such as writing, holding objects, walking, or sewing
* Absent at rest, unlike classic ET
* Affect hands, legs, and head
* Improve with alcohol, worsen with caffeine
* Exacerbated by stress, not anxiety or phobia

Patient experiences:

Anna, 42: No tremor at rest, only when trying to type or hold objects. Doctors immediately said ET.

Marek, 35: Hands and legs trembled during use; alcohol helped, coffee worsened it, yet doctors insisted it was ET.

Monika, 39: My head tremor only appeared in social stress situations. At rest, nothing happened.

# Chapter 2 — The Systemic Misdiagnosis Problem

* 90–95 percent of patients with infection-related tremors are misdiagnosed with ET or sent to psychiatry
* Physicians rarely test for Lyme, Bartonella, or Babesia
* Misdiagnosis can persist for 3–10 years before proper diagnosis
* Standard ET treatments do not resolve infection-related tremors

# Chapter 3 — Scientific Evidence

* Studies show that Lyme spirochetes can persist despite antibiotic therapy, confirming the possibility of chronic infection
* Chronic infection can affect neurological function, including tremors
* Standard serologic tests often fail to detect persistent infection
* Physicians who attempt long-term or combination therapy are sometimes professionally challenged or legally threatened

Evidence confirms that chronic Lyme and co-infections exist and can cause tremors that mimic ET.

# Chapter 4 — Treatment Pathway

# Diagnostic Workup

* Lyme: ELISA and Western blot
* Bartonella: serology and PCR
* Babesia: PCR or blood smear

# Targeted Therapy

* Lyme: antibiotics for 4–6 weeks or longer
* Bartonella: azithromycin and rifampin
* Babesia: atovaquone and azithromycin

# Supportive Therapy

* Magnesium, B12, anti-inflammatory diet, physical therapy

# Progression of Tremor Improvement

1. Hands: 4–8 weeks
2. Legs: 8–12 weeks
3. Head: 6–12 months

Monika, 39: After six weeks, hands stopped; legs improved after two months; head tremor disappeared after ten weeks. ET diagnosis remained in records.

# Chapter 5 — Patients with Misdiagnosed ET

|Name|Age|Symptoms|Wrong Diagnosis|Infection Treatment|Tremor Improvement|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Anna|42|Hands, legs, head|ET|Lyme + Bartonella|Hands 4w, Legs 8w, Head 6m|
|Marek|35|Hands, head|ET|Bartonella|Hands 5w, Head 10w|
|Tomasz|38|Hands, legs|ET|Lyme|Hands 3w, Legs 7w|
|Katarzyna|50|Hands, legs, head|ET|Lyme + Babesia|Hands 6w, Legs 10w, Head 12m|

Patient experiences:

Anna, 42: Doctor said ET and nothing could be done. After Lyme and Bartonella treatment, tremors fully stopped.

Marek, 35: Hands and legs trembled only during use. After targeted therapy, hands stopped after a month, legs after two months, head after ten weeks.

Monika, 39: I had tremor in my head only during social interaction. After treatment, it completely stopped within a year.

# Chapter 6 — Absurdity of the Medical System

* Physicians deny treatment citing that chronic Lyme does not exist
* Those who treat patients are harassed, investigated, and legally challenged
* Patients remain untreated or misdiagnosed with ET or psychiatric disorders

Tomasz, 38: Neurologist dismissed it as ET. Psychiatrist was the next step, but nothing fixed the tremors. Only targeted infection treatment worked.

# Chapter 7 — Statistical Overview

Estimated causes of tremors in patients misdiagnosed with ET:

* Lyme + Co-infections: 75–85 percent
* True ET: 10–15 percent
* Other Causes: 5–10 percent

90–95 percent of infection-caused tremors are misdiagnosed as ET. Less than 1 percent of neurologists correctly identify infection as cause.

# Chapter 8 — The Collision Analogy

Imagine a patient with Lyme standing on train tracks. The train is labeled SYSTEM, representing mainstream medicine. This illustrates:

* Patient faces misdiagnosis, dismissal, or psychiatric referral
* Even when physicians know infections could cause tremor, fear of legal or professional consequences stops them from treating
* The collision represents systemic failure

# Chapter 9 — Comparing Two Patient Pathways

# Pathway A: Standard Neurologist

* Tremor and neurological symptoms
* Labs negative
* Diagnosis: ET
* Treatment: beta-blockers or anti-anxiety medication
* Outcome: symptoms persist, often referred to psychiatry

# Pathway B: Infection-Aware Clinician (ILADS/LLMD)

* Same symptoms
* Comprehensive infectious testing performed
* Co-infections identified
* Targeted antimicrobial therapy prescribed
* Outcome: symptom reduction over months

Patient experiences: LLMD therapy improved my tremor, walking, and overall function after years of failed standard treatment.

# Chapter 10 — Scale of the Problem

* There are hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. alone with persistent neurological symptoms after Lyme infection
* Estimates suggest 30,000–60,000 may experience tremors or similar neurological issues each year
* Most will never receive a correct diagnosis
* Tremors may affect hands, legs, and head, though many patients do not tremble at rest
* Only a small percentage of neurologists have the knowledge or ability to correctly identify infection-related tremor

# Chapter 11 — Neurological Reality vs Systemic Barriers

# Numbers: Neurologists vs Actual Need

* \~18,000 practicing neurologists in the U.S.
* \~4.5 neurologists per 100,000 people
* Only 1–5 percent of neurologists recognize infection-caused tremor in mainstream practice
* Less than 1 percent in states like Wisconsin would treat due to risk of losing license

# Real-World Barriers

* Lack of training on chronic infections
* Fear of legal and professional consequences
* Systemic denial of treatment
* Patients often forced to seek private clinics or alternative therapy

# Likelihood of Correct Diagnosis by Region

|Country / Region|Estimated Chance Neurologist Recognizes Infection|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|USA (general)|1–5%|Default diagnosis: ET or psychiatric|
|Wisconsin, USA|<1%|Legal pressure deters treatment|
|UK|2–5%|Chronic Lyme controversial, private treatment common|
|Poland|1–3%|Very few neurologists trained to identify co-infections|

# Patient Experiences

* Many report seeing 3–5 neurologists and still receiving ET diagnoses before seeing an infection-aware clinician
* Only private LLMD/ILADS clinics or self-directed therapies lead to improvement
* Tremors can fully resolve after months of targeted treatment even after years of misdiagnosis

# Chapter 12 — Conclusion

1. ET diagnosis is often incorrect when tremors are infection-related
2. Patients wait years for proper diagnosis
3. Physicians rarely believe in chronic Lyme or co-infections
4. Targeted infection treatment can fully resolve tremors
5. Patients pursuing independent diagnostics and therapy often see dramatic recovery, even after years of misdiagnosis
6. Thousands of people globally are living with treatable neurological symptoms without recognition",3,1769884226.0,EssentialTremor,4,1.0,False

I have come in possession of two roughly 8-9 pound waygu beef plate ribs. Caveman brain could not resist. Holy cow these things are fatty. Looking to cook these for the super bowl next week on my pellet smoker.

Hoping this cuts the richness a bit and adds a bit of a bite.

Part that I am hung up on is what to smoke it at. Usually for beef, I smoke as low as I can at 225 or even 200 if its an overnight cook. I've seen folks smoking these higher at 250 or even 275. Anyone got any tips or tricks for these? Do wish I bought something less marbled since beef rib on its own usually is marbled enough.

If I dont find the courage to knock soon, it will be locked forever and I wil stay stuck being miserable and intolerable to myself.
I have a series of issues I need to work out that build on top another, so I will try to start with the broad strokes and work my way down to the minutia. For context I am 30(M), have a wife and 2 young kids, not college educated, own my home, and have a dead end job in F&B.

===Anxiety & Depression===

Ah yes, the dynamic duo. So I have always had some level depression for most of my life, a little bitch whispering in my ear telling me Im nasty, but I was able to power through and ignore it up to my mid 20's. The bad news is that over the past years it has grown from a whisper to a bullhorn. The good news, after some serious ""untangling"" I've figured out where it all stemmed from. When I was a small child my mother would drop me me off at my grandmother's whom my cousin lived with. Man's was 4 years older than me and would beat up and abuse me horrendously well up until he turned 15 or so and started smoking weed. This in turn made me a nervous wreck and when I started school it made it difficult to make friends and I would also be consistently bullied well until high-school. So it goes.

As far as the anxiety goes, I didn't even recognize I had it until very recently. I always just chalked it up to ""being socially awkward"" and just ""being cautious"" which maybe for a time it was just that, but now its exacerbated to being downright debilitating. I have turned into a NERVOUS FUCKING COWARD. I don't reach out and talk to people anymore. I'm practically mute in social situations even with people I know. If I do have to talk to someone I don't know I have to carefully rehearse so slowly and methodically Im sure most people think im dumb. I won't go out and drive at certain hours of the day. If me and my wife are traveling I get thrown into a nervous tizzy if the route gets changed or I have to make an unscheduled stop. I used to be adventurous and freewheeling and now I have to have an itinerary anytime I do anything. I constantly catastrophize any little set back. I simpply cant continue on like this. I'm not sure if this caused it,  but it certainly got exacerbated after I crashed and burned at a middle management position for a big box retailer.

===No talents, No skills===

Like I said, I never got any secondary education. I tried doing community college but had to drop out within 8 weeks due to circumstances beyond my control. Now that ship has long sailed and unless I win the lottery going to school is not economically feasible. And I would be fine with that if I had SOMETHING I could say I was good at at least, but it seems like I have some curse where Im not allowed to progress beyond 'mid at best'. But no, between all the ventures I've taken, photography, guitar/music, electronics refurbishing, resin art, etc. etc. everything just never gets to where I could tell someone Im ""good"" at it. Shit ive been a barista for almost 15 years and cant barely do latte art lol. Im only allowed to be okay or bad. Or so it seems. I have come to the conclusion that the aforementioned anxiety has me in a sort of chokehold where Im literally afraid to keep trying and try new things. Consciously im aware I shouldn't care if things are good or bad and I should just enjoy doing it but I think my stupid brain is trying to shield me from the pain of being  bad at it. This stupid brain glitch is holding me back from a lot of shit I could be doing to have a more fulfilling enriching life, especially when it comes to...


===Career Shift===

I absolutely have to shift careers. I made 250$ my last check I cant survive and support a family  like this. My entire resume is Food and Bev, primarily with coffee, and I have to claw my way out somehow.  I once had a fairly well paying job working for a certain mermaid and a spotted dog. Did that for 8 years until I made the boneheaded decision to step up to mid management and I was chewed up and spit out by the following year. I simply wasn't built for it. At least not there, at that time and my mental health took a steep nosedive. I lived off my savings for a few months attempting to figure out a way to be self employed. I posted on reddit looking for advice when a commenter hit me with ""Well what skills do you have?"" and that simple earnest question sent me on a spiral. They were right. I am a loser with no skills and should step back into the cogs. So I relented and managed to get nepo'd into a local coffee shop to make a couple bucks while ""I figure things out"". That was a year ago and spoiler, I have not figured it out. 

So here I am now scrolling indeed looking at entry level jobs i was hypothetically qualified for. At first I choked. ""You mean all these jobs require me TALKING TO PEOPLE? LOTS OF PEOPLE? ALL THE TIME? FOR IN DEPTH LENGTHY AMOUNTS OF TIME?"" But then I saw the salaries for some of them. Insurance 50k starting? Okay okay. Sales, upwards of 6 whole digits possible?? Entry level position?? So here I am looking at the potentiality of a comfortable sustainable wage with only 2 things in my way: the most brutal job market in history and a weak, sniveling trembling rabbit of a COWARD that is my own self. I must kill him, but I don't know how. 

I am at a a paradigm shift in my life and I must see it through, but I don't know where to start. It feels like I consciously know I just need to reach out and grab it, but something is telling me my arms and hands are broken and to not bother, i wont lkke it anyway.

Sorry this ended up turning into more of a long winded rant than anything. Not expecting anyone to address the info dump as a whole, but I appreciate any tidbits of insight anyone can give.

My partner and I have a 2 year old. I have repeatedly asked or had to remind him not to have a steaming hot drink around our child, as recently as today. He is currently unwell and made himself a lemsip. He must've left it at the back of the kitchen counter for around 5 minutes before he went to sit with our toddler at the kitchen table where she was playing. I see the steam coming off of it and basically scold him (because I am sick to the back of my teeth of this issue), and tell him to put it back on the counter. Cue an argument and him basically telling me that I'm overreacting.

For context, she always tries to wait till the last minute and want to do it right before we go to bed, I don’t because I know what might happen. She knows this and even in this recent situation or in past ones she’s even drank coffee earlier in the night (because she loves coffee and already knows she’s tired) to stay up longer. My issue is the fact that it seems like she never puts in the effort to prioritize it. We’ll watch whatever show we’re hooked on until next thing you know she’s falling asleep. I often try to kiss her and initiate or send hints of trying to initiate before she starts to get tired but she goes back to focusing on the show. In this recent situation we even agreed to watch a little TV then get to it but for some reason she thought when she said “we should turn it off after this” (in the middle of a show before an ad comes on) she meant turn it off when the ad starts, not what I thought which was the episode. Mind you, in this time she never tries to kiss me in certain ways to say “hey let’s go let’s get started” and then gets upset at me for getting upset when I should of understood she’s tired.

Tbh I feel like I really have no friends. I’ve met people through my kid’s school community. I go for drinks with two of them once a month or so and we are on a group chat that buzzes once in a while. But I don’t really like them. One of them kind of drives me crazy because she’s really selfish and only talks about her problems when we are out. The other one is just kind of, well, boring.

I have another mom I’ve known for even longer from the school and I actually like her better, but she’s not one of these people who texts or wants to stay in contact. She actually told me once, “I’m not a texter and don’t really like to be in touch all the time.” So it’s not a female friend I can feel super close to. We’ll plan lunches, drinks or coffee once a month or so, and when we are out, we have a lot to chat about an more in common then the other two, but she’s kind of reserved and impossible to get super close with since she doesn’t like banter or much contact between hang outs.

My daughter started high school this year and I thought maybe I could build a new group of mom friends through that and I actually have tried. I have a new group chat with them and we did drinks and a paint night so far, but again, it’s just a lack of anything in common.

The thing is, I’m younger than most of the moms. Like significantly so. I started a family way before any of my high school and college friends. They are all having babies now or maybe have toddlers.

I want friends who like the same music. Indie, emo, or 2000’s hip hop lol. I want friends I can banter with and spill all my secrets too. I want the feeling I had from my younger years when I had besties to laugh with and bullshit with.

Sigh. Making friends as an adult is just hard af. I put myself out there. I’m not great at welcoming people into my life on a deeper level unless I feel trusting and like we have a good connection from the start. I’m not comfortable being the “host” of the group either and I know getting close requires people to come into my home.

This past holiday season I got my hands on some DAK Milky Cake and Cardamom Bun. After all of the promising comments from this community I was truly excited to dive in. After over a month of rest, multiple recipes, and a couple of brewers I just couldn’t quite crack the code while grinding with my Timemore O78.

Admittedly, I am a washed coffee guy. I have subscriptions to Flower Child and SEY but was looking for something different over the holidays. For DAK I was brewing at cooler temps, with less agitation than I’m used to, but there were still off putting flavor notes from both bags. Don’t get me wrong I got some ok cups but it just wasn’t doing it for me. After 6-8 weeks of rest I put the remaining Cinnamon bun into the freezer for another time. 

Recently Brian Quan’s “How to Brew Dank and Funky Processed Coffees” video popped up on my YouTube algorithm and I gave it a watch. He talks about how high clarity grinders don’t always help for processed coffees. 💡\*lightbulb\* I hustled into my kitchen and adjusted my DF64 that I use for espresso to a typical filter setting. I pulled my Cardamom Bun from the freezer and voila. Easily the most enjoyable of DAK I’ve had. (92° water-low agitation 3 pour V60 recipe)

I’m not sure why it took so long to give another grinder a try but since I typically only use my DF64 (with stock Italmill burrs) for espresso it just wasn’t on my radar. 

So my question for all of you funky coffee lovers, what is your favorite grinder, and do you ever change back and forth between a couple depending on the bean? Is it safe to assume that a ZP6 is better for washed coffees and something like a k-ultra would be more versatile for the funky stuff? Lastly are there any tricks to brewing funky coffee on high clarity grinders? 

With all the DAK and B&W love on this page maybe this will help someone else who is brewing a heavily processed coffee. ",6,1769883787.0,pourover,16,0.8,False

→ Pataleshwar Cave (tried Modern Cafe's coffee (4/5); it's nearby only)  
→ Raja Dinkar Museum (Museum note: Unexpectedly very time-consuming for history lovers who like reading everything like me, with many unique items—totally worth it)  
→ Noon rest  
→ Evening work visit to Hinjewadi (got stuck in heavy traffic)  
→ Dinner at a local dhaba  
→ Night roaming in Balewadi till midnight (saw something unique there; will mostly create another post for that thing only)

Day 5:  
Outer Pune exploration:  
→ Ramdara Mandir  
→ Chintamani Ganesh Mandir (Theur)  
→ World Peace Dome  
→ Aga Khan Palace  
→ Ate Burger King's burger (first time seeing so much craze for a burger → worth the wait and struggle)  
→ Mahadji Shinde Chhatri  
→ Miniature Rail Museum (lucky to attend their 30-minute live show (Sat–Sun till 8 PM), we arrived at 7:30 PM and were the last group, and we didn’t even know about the show prior)  
→ Then roamed around FC Road till midnight

Day 6:  
Returned the rented scooty → Visited local temples → Flew kites with local children  
→ The trip ended.

Overall:  
I genuinely loved the atmosphere of Pune. There’s something between chaos and total silence—it’s neither too crowded nor too silent. I enjoyed it a lot. Initially, I was scared because I didn’t know Marathi, but kind people are everywhere, so I didn't have to face much problems.

Cons Observed:

1. The smoking culture is very open; in most of the restaurants, there are ashtrays & smokers, which was uncomfortable for me as a non-smoker.
2. Lack of driving discipline, I nearly escaped an accident on Day 5; people constantly honk and rush to overtake others. I don’t know why.
3. Meter system of autos & cabs even when you're booking from Ola, Uber or Rapido.

Other than that, it was a fun & memorable trip.

1qs9w8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1qs9w8r/i_highly_distrust_women_what_do_you_think/,I highly distrust women. What do you think?,"I don't advocate for any of my ideas, nor do I want a society where this distrust exists. However, I cannot deny that I distrust women highly. A few examples being:

\- If a woman smiles and laughs in affirmation of something a man said / did, I always think it's fake and she is secretly plotting something sinister

\- In most interactions a woman has with a man, eventually her mind thinks ""Does he like me and find me attractive"", and she will subtly try to seduce him in order to get validation. They can't even fathom having a normal platonic conversation with a man, without either accusing him in her mind of wanting her, or without her wanting him to be seduced. Like even if a man goes to a store and asks a female employee for help, she will think ""he wants me""

\- If women could vote to harm all men, the vote to harm all men would be a LARGE minority or even close to 50/50. And women will value a male life less than a female life in a moral dilemma

\- Women can't be attached to just one guy. They can only be monogamous for a few years, and then they eventually want to cheat. Since they know that they can get endless male attention - so this attention corrupts them (as humans can get corrupted) and so women want to not miss out on anything

\- Women deny the fact that their own gender can do the SAME EXACT evil things. Murder, rape, torture etc. And I think that most women are constantly thinking in their minds that most men are likely to commit such things

\- If a date is simple: a walk, a coffee date, going to the movies etc a woman will be turned off. She needs either grand adventure or something expensive

\- Women don't care about the platonic approval of men. We all like approval from each other. However, women don't care what men think about them. I'm not talking about sexuality. I'm talking about things like women don't care what men think about their hobbies, their creations (like artwork) etc. They don't care to get a man's opinion about their ideas etc

\- They get angry when they see masculine things. Since women ""hate"" men these days (I don't think they HATE men but they 100% dislike men), a part of them gets angry seeing masculine things and men doing those things

I don't want to think these things. I am not advocating for these things. I just want to know how I got these ideas. I never had them before. And none of these ideas make me treat women badly. It simply makes me not trust them AT ALL

But I was out eating breakfast and decided to have two cups of coffee. After about 3 hours I felt a tired/exhaustion that I would only feel if I got like 3 hours of sleep. And for reference I got around 7.5-8 hours of sleep that night which is normal for me. I was having trouble remembering things at my job and it was just overall a struggle. But I felt fine the next day. Is it caffeine related or am I just linkikg two unconnected things?",2,1769883669.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,0.75,False

When you pour hot coffee, the design changes and reveals a Gameboy screen.

Looks cool in videos, but I’m not sure about long-term quality.

Does anyone here own something similar?

Does the print actually last after regular use?

Haven't seen either of those offered in cafes when I do go in. 

Swamp Cow looks like a decent kava bar except it's focused more on being a bar / night place. Looking forward to checking that out. 

  
Stoup in Capitol Hill does offer a kava cocktail which is great, but doesn't really have the cafe / work space vibe - generally more of an events space most of the time. 

  
Other recs in the sub seemed mostly focused on bars that offer non alcoholic alternatives. I'm going to check some of those out but looking for somewhere to hang out during the day.
