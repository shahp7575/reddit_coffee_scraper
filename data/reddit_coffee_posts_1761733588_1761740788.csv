The general manager of the company, so Iike 6 levels above us, ( I mean he has 500 people under him) is really annoying. Uptight, stern, strict, arrogant, belittling and very demanding. A guy in his mid 40s. 

She (28) is trying to impress him all the time. Even though she said she doesn't. We have very little to do with him but every time there is an email allocated to her (and he is in cc) she says stuff like:
I apologise for my colleague's mistake
Or
I just took over this case and will solve it myself.
So she doesn't say our names but she makes it clear she is not one of us and the mistake was done by us. She basically blames us all.
He was here on day, shouted at all of us (so her included) and she worked all night to fix everything. She constantly complains she has a lot of work to do but when there is a situation that is involving him and its allocated so someone else, she wants it for herself. It happened yesterday. She told me to put the case on her because she has already started working on it. So I did but I am sure she lied.


One day idk what he did but spilled coffee and she literally got on her knees and started rubbing his pants and belt to clean it.


I am not really asking for an advice just to vent. If we asked her to make a coffee for us (if she is already making one for herself, she would say no). She is especially mean with other women and girls. But also with guys who are on her level or below.",2,1761739649.0,TwoHotTakes,8,1.0,False
1oj2qd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oj2qd0/she_keeps_saying_youre_the_one_for_me_but_i_cant/,"She keeps saying “You’re the one for me, but I can’t do this.” 3 breakups in 8 months — someone please explain this.","Hey everyone,
I’m posting here because I’m truly lost trying to make sense of what’s happening with my ex (21F).
I’m 23M, and we were together for 5 years. We basically grew up together — first love, first everything.
She’s emotional, sensitive, and caring, but she really struggles to communicate when things get emotionally heavy.

The relationship ended in February. She said:

“There’s too much that happened.”
“I can’t feel it anymore.”
“I love you, but I’m not in love with you.”
“You hurt me too much — I can’t trust you.”

It was devastating, but I respected her decision.

⸻

Then, two months later (April), she reached out again saying she missed me and wanted to talk.
We met up, everything felt familiar and warm again, and within days we were back together.
After about two weeks, she got sick, stopped communicating properly, grew distant, and then ended things again.

And the words were identical:

“There’s too much that happened.”
“I can’t do this.”
“You hurt me too much.”
“I can’t trust you.”

Then she went completely cold again.

⸻

Fast forward to late September — she reached out again, this time full of love and excitement.
She told me things like “I’m so happy you’re back in my life” and even cried in my arms saying she was scared I’d leave her again.
For three weeks, everything was perfect — we laughed, cooked together, she was affectionate, constantly texting, saying how lucky she was to have me.

Then, once again, she got sick.
The next morning, she woke up crying and said:

“You’re the person for me, but I can’t.”
“I wish I had reached out later — that there was more time between us.”
“There’s too much that happened.”
“I can’t feel it anymore.”

Same lines. Same ending.

After that, she kept texting me warmly for about three days — and then suddenly flipped the switch.
Cold. Distant. Like I never existed.

⸻

When I saw her last week at an event, she was watching me from a distance the entire time — but when I approached her and calmly asked if she wanted to grab a coffee sometime, she immediately said “no” and walked away.

It’s the exact same pattern every time:
	1.	She misses me and reaches out.
	2.	We reconnect — deeply, lovingly.
	3.	She gets physically sick.
	4.	Communication stops.
	5.	She ends it abruptly with the same sentences every time:
“There’s too much that happened.”
“I can’t do this.”
“You hurt me too much.”
“I can’t trust you.”
	6.	Then, she goes completely cold.
	7.	Weeks or months later, she comes back again.

⸻

For context — she didn’t have a “bad” childhood, but her emotional environment was shallow.
Her mom tends to dominate conversations, always talks about herself, and leaves little emotional space for my ex.
My ex has told me she often feels unseen and unheard at home, and that she hates that dynamic.

I feel like she craves love but is terrified of receiving it.
Like she’s fighting her own need for closeness.
Every time she finally gets emotional intimacy, she becomes overwhelmed — almost physically ill — and then runs.

⸻

So I really want to hear from people who understand this pattern, especially fearful avoidants (FA) or people who’ve dated one:
	1.	Does this sound like an FA cycle to you?
This “come close → panic → leave → regret → repeat” loop?
	2.	What’s with the physical sickness?
It’s like her body reacts to emotional overload. Every single time before she ends it, she literally gets ill.
	3.	Why does she keep using the same sentences?
Every time she ends it, it’s “There’s too much that happened, I can’t do this, you hurt me too much.”
Yet she keeps coming back after a few months. What does that mean?
	4.	Do fearful avoidants ever stop running and actually choose to face that fear?
Or do they eventually just shut down for good?
	5.	When she says “You’re the person for me, but I can’t,” what does that really mean emotionally for an FA?
Is it a way of protecting herself? Or does she genuinely believe it in the moment?

⸻

I’ve accepted that I can’t fix her or chase her anymore.
I’m not reaching out — I’m focusing on myself, but I can’t lie, I still want to understand.

I’m not angry at her. I just feel like I’m the only one trying to make sense of something that to me feels so illogical — how can someone love you so deeply one week and be totally cold the next?

If any of you reading this have ever been the avoidant one:
What was really going through your mind when you left someone who you still loved?
And did you ever come back — not out of guilt, but out of real clarity?

Any perspective would mean a lot.

I’m 30m and my girlfriend is 25f we been together since the end of 2020 and we got our first apartment in the beginning of 2022. We have 2 kids together and I have 1 on my own. She’s since moved out this past weekend after a heated argument.

For a little backstory before leading up to this argument there have been a series of arguments and we don’t argue offer just have had big ones. When we first moved in I was paying all the bills. The rent, utilities, all the streaming services. I was also doing most of the grocery shopping. Mind you it’s our first apartment so it’s all new to me. Now fast forward 8 months her dad pays for tickets for her, her sister and our daughter to go to Florida. I told her I can’t go because I can’t afford it. So she’s goes with her sister and the baby for the week. When they come back we get into an argument after I pick them up and drop her sister off at their mom’s house. She claimed that I didn’t do anything with the baby and that I didn’t help at all (which wasn’t true I changed diapers and gave bath time the only thing I couldn’t do was drop the kids off in the morning to their grandparents house because of my work hours). She was also mad at me because I didn’t call her at all on vacation. During the argument her sister chimes in and says she shouldn’t be punished for going on vacation. So after that argument I told her has to start paying half of the utilities and rent. It was never really half I pick up most of it to make it easier on her. 

That was our first major argument as a couple. Now there has been other arguments when I was fixing her car and I just wanted to feel appreciated I never wanted anything in return. She tells me she never asked me to work on her car. 

Fast forward to last year her sister starts dating this guy who did 2 years in jail. Their oldest sister was concerned and did a background and he went away for domestic violence he’s only 25 btw. No one really held this against him until he started causing problems. Her sister moved into their grandmothers house and basically moved this guy in without asking. And this guy is wildly disrespectful like blocking her grandmother in the laundry room and demanding she apologize to him. Screaming the n word with the hard r at the top of his lungs. It got so bad her grandmother had a mental breakdown and went into the hospital. Her sister moved back home with their mom and was given specific rules that her boyfriend could come over but his stuff is not to be there or is he allowed to stay (they also have a baby by this point now). Couple of weeks go by and everything is fine until he starts driving her car and coming in the house like he owns the place and having his clothes on her coffee table. He’s told to pick up his stuff by her mom and he starts flipping out. Calling her racist and telling her to come off the property and hit her. There was a lot more but that’s the gist of it. I saw the ring camera footage and I told my girlfriend that I don’t want him around the kids and that I’m no longer helping them with their car. He finds out and blast my phone with texts calling me a faggot and girl for not telling him to his face. He was texting my girl the same thing and all she had to say was I have a right to my own opinion didn’t really defend me in anyway to her sister or to him. I’ve mostly tried to stay out of the drama because I never wanted to be a wedge between her and her sister. But after that I took the keys away from the suv that I gave her and I told her I wasn’t feeling appreciated and I’m also not working on anyone’s cars anymore including hers. 

Fast how to 3 weeks ago her car breaks down while I’m at work and she had to leave it at my mom’s when she dropped the baby off. She then didn’t speak to me for 2 weeks and I went to her twice asking what was wrong and both times she turned me away saying she wasn’t talking to me in front of the kids. So I stop talking to her and one day I leave without putting the infant car seat in her car (we only have 1) and I’m on my way to work already 20 minutes down the road I didn’t turn around and I just told her to figure it out. I shouldn’t have done that obviously and that’s on me. I woke up a few days ago a her sister’s boyfriend texts me out of the blew calling me a faggot again. I ignore him like I usually do but I blew up on her asking what I did and she turns around and says that I don’t give a tuck about her because I didn’t fix her car she said the one person she’s supposed to go to she can’t. I asked her if she felt this way when I was fixing it and she was driving around in a new car. 

Now I’m no saint I have my own faults and I recognize that. I yell I’m hot headed when things build up without speaking for long periods of time. I also recognize that I should give her more quality time. I’m not looking for validation for people to tell me I’m right and she’s wrong we’ve both have had faults. But I told her that her sister is going to be the death of our relationship.

1oj2oq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1oj2oq0/my_manager_said_in_office_days_rebuild_trust_so_i/,"My manager said in office days rebuild trust, so I ran a 10 day trust experiment and the data did not match the vibe","Two Mondays ago our VP announced new in office rules, three days a week for culture and trust. I am a mid level engineer on a platform team, New Jersey, two kids, the usual chaos. Instead of arguing in circles I opened a new sheet and wrote down what trust even means for our team. I picked five signals that felt objective enough. One, code review turn around in hours from assign to first comment. Two, number of cross team asks that got a clear owner in the same day. Three, meeting attendance vs invites, because trust dies when half the room ghosts. Four, incidents, not just count, but time to acknowledgement and time to steady state. Five, context breaks, which I proxied by Slack pings inside my blocked focus hours. Then I ran ten work days, five at home the last remote week and five in office the first mandate week. I logged commute too, but I promised myself to not let travel cost dominate the story, becase my manager only hears culture if the frame is not money. Day one of the sheet looked neat, pen and paper next to my laptop, timer widget, alarms for standups. By day three I had sticky notes all over the ThinkPad and a photo of a neon green phone booth fan label that reads 62 dB at ear height, because that thing whines like a hair dryer.

The numbers surprised me. At home week, median PR first response was 1 hour 12 min, in office it slipped to 2 hours 05. My guess, reviewers kept getting pulled into drive by questions, nobody is the villain here, but the effect is real. Cross team asks went up in count in office, which sounds like a win, except only 58 percent of them landed an owner by end of day, vs 81 percent remote. People thought alignment happened just because we spoke in person. Attendance was flat, but time spent starting late jumped, we burned 9 to 14 minutes waiting for stragglers becase someone forgot to book a room or badge issues. Two incidents hit during the in office block. Acknowledge time was faster in person, 6 minutes vs 12 at home, but time to steady state was longer, 1 hour 41 vs 1 hour 05. We kept bumping into people who had opinions and the channel got noisy, lots of ""try this quick"" that reset the mental stack. Context breaks were the wild card. At home I had 7.6 pings per day inside focus blocks on average, in office it jumped to 14.9. Most were friendly taps, small favors, can you look at this real quick, but every one is a context switch and I feel it in my chest by 3 pm. Commute was 152 to 176 mins per in office day round trip on NJ Transit plus the walk, daycare pickup risk high if a meeting spills. Food spend went up to 17 to 24 per day unless I packed rice and eggs, which I did for three days and felt like a college kid again. None of that is a tragedy, but when I chart it side by side it is definetly not the trust story we were sold.

I am going to pitch a pilot that keeps the cultural stuff but stops the random context bleed. One overlap day with a real whiteboard block, not eight fractured half hours. One optional social cowork day that people can use for pairing, mentoring, coffee. The rest at home with a simple guardrail, two daily focus windows marked in the team calender where pings wait unless production is on fire. To make this not a rant I will bring the sheet and three charts. Trend of PR response time by location, cross team asks vs owned, and incidents timeline with annotations for random interventions that did not help. I will not mention commute money first, I will lead with outcomes, because that is what leadership wants to point at in QBRs. If anyone here tried something similar, what metric did your VP actually respect. If you are a manager, which one chart would make you say yes to six weeks of this. And if my proxy for trust is garbage, tell me a better one.

The next thing I know there’s a keylogger in my machine. 

He took over all my online accounts, played games locking me out of every accounts I made. 

My cheating ex who I was with at the time finds out about this and tells her husband and he contacted Harris and now they team up on me. This man has and his criminal organization has been harassing me for five years now and have even gained access to my home putting fentanyl in my coffee products trying to kill me. 

This criminal organization does open relationships and the next thing you know Harris’s ring leader over here in New York has his old girlfriend playing my loving loyal girlfriend betraying me the entire time. Access points were set up in her home and also my apartment since she had my car while at work making copies to my apartment keys. 

Harris then Hacked into everything I had a second time now. Locked me out of 3 computers overwriting my password using the openssl -6 salt newuser newpasswd command and editing my /etc/passwd file and replacing my original with his new one. He cost me thousands in computers and firewalls. He also used Bluesnarfer hacking 3 brand new iPhones and locking me out of them. Two firewalls were destroyed. 

We battled at the first house I was at. He was using metasploit and a fortigate exploit to gain access to my firewall via port 443. I changed that port locking him out and he had a temper tantrum. Then my ISP goes down. When it came back online two hours later my domain name servers were being blocked via my ISP’s server rendering my firewall useless. 

Harris is a cyber criminal. He has manipulated people in my life. My life long friend feeds him information now helping him get my phone number so he can intercept banking info and put fraudulent charges on my bank card. All the social engineering attempts made by him and his crew at the 1337. Don’t join hack the box. What might he do to you if he gets mad at ya?

Yeah, because Grandma wasn’t blowin’ half her paycheck on $9 iced coffee and avocado toast, that’s why!

Back then, if they wanted coffee, they made it at home. With grounds so strong it could remove rust.

And Grandma wasn’t out there “brunchin’.” You think she had time for brunch? No! She was at home, cooking something called whatever’s left in the house.

Oh, don’t even get me started on the kids. “We can’t make ends meet, but Brayden needs the new iPhone!” No, he doesn’t. You’re giving an $1100 phone to a kid who still eats glue and boogers. 

When we were kids, the family phone hung on the wall. It had a cord long enough to jump rope with, and if you wanted privacy, you had to go stand in the pantry. And somehow, we survived.

And the TV? There was one. One. 
It was in the living room, and Dad controlled it. If he wanted to watch bowling, guess what? You liked bowling.

They lived within their means. Whatever Grandpa’s paycheck bought, that’s what they had. They didn’t try to keep up with the Joneses. They were just trying to keep the fed and a roof over their heads.

So yeah, Grandpa could buy a house on one salary. But he also didn’t have 10 subscriptions and emotional-support gerbils. He had one support system, Grandma, who told him to suck it up and mow the yard.

Start building content that actually lasts.

That’s how top creators film 30 days of content in one weekend, without losing their minds.

**STEP 1: BUILD YOUR FOOTAGE BANK**  
Film once, use it forever.  
Don’t record one clip per post, create a library that works for any idea.  
Shoot clips like:  
• Walking with your phone  
• Typing or journaling  
• Making coffee  
• Talking head clips from different angles  
• Close-ups of your workspace or product  
• Behind-the-scenes moments  
• Screen recordings of your process  
These are your *“building blocks.”* Your future self will thank you.

**STEP 2: FILM SMART, NOT HARD**  
Variety keeps people watching.  
In the same session, switch between:  
• POV shots  
• Over-the-shoulder  
• Talking to camera  
• Wide + detail combo  
• Side profile  
• Top-down desk view  
• A few handheld shots for realism  
Change angles, not effort.

**STEP 3: MASTER YOUR FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
Most creators lose viewers before they even start.  
Use hooks that make people stop:  
• “I wish I knew this before I started…”  
• “Nobody talks about this part of content creation…”  
• “You’re doing X wrong, here’s why.”  
• “POV: when your content finally starts working.”  
Hooks aren’t *tricks.* Lead with what matters.

**STEP 4: TURN ONE SHOOT INTO TEN VIDEOS**  
Don’t create more, multiply what you already have.  
Try this:  
• Add voiceovers to your B-roll  
• React to your own clips  
• Reuse footage with new hooks  
• Split-screen vs old content  
• Add subtitles and remix transitions  
• Post both a “talking” and “silent text” version  
It’s not about being everywhere, it’s about being efficient you know.

He approached me and I was very attracted so I said yes. The connection felt real. He’s confident, a little old-school masculine. He’s intelligent, has an amazing sense of humor and very motivating and supportive with every I have going on. Chemistry was amazing. 

We’d go on very long dates. Every date we’d spend hours together. Every date ended with us making out for like an hour (we never had sex though). He’s building a business, so I’ve been really intentional about giving him space and not pushing for labels. For some of our dates we would meet at coffee shops or lounges, and work side by side. The chemistry and emotional intimacy felt strong. 

I did notice some red flags but I chalked it up to us having different backgrounds. Some of the red flags were him not inviting me to his house the whole time we were dating, us never talking about “next steps” together (we would of course talk about our own individual goals), and he would be unavailable during the day sometimes. But I thought that he’s just busy. 

Here’s where things fell apart:

He was recently traveling for work. We talked the night before he left and talked about planning something for when he gets back. While he was traveling, I would check up on him every couple of days. It would just be short check in conversations. 

A few nights ago, I sent him a voice note saying I wanted to take things to the next level. He didn’t open it for a couple days, then just responded with a generic “hey how are you” text and completely ignoring what I’d said.

I sat with that for a bit, but it really hurt. So last night I sent this:

“I opened up to you and you didn’t acknowledge it. It makes me feel like you don’t care about it.”

He still hasn’t even *opened* the message. It’s been over 24 hours. 

I keep spiraling between “I was too vulnerable” and “why would he say all those things about the future and act so affectionate if he was just going to disappear when it got real?” Part of me feels like I’m being dramatic, but another part feels like… if someone cares, don’t they at least *respond*?

I’m not planning to double-text or chase. But I can’t shake this feeling that I scared him off by asking for more, or that maybe I was just convenient until I wanted something deeper.

Was my message too much? Or is his silence telling me everything I need to know? Or should I give him more time since he is still traveling? I need some thoughts. ",1,1761739037.0,dating,9,1.0,False

After few hours of googling and researching, i got into typical loop of recommendations, opinions and so on and on.

Typically we drink 2-4 coffee mugs a day, more like americano from our some sort of delonghi. It broke down and because service would be like half of original purchasing price, we decided to buy new one, this time with milk dispenser, because we do like to have latte/cappucino from time to time.

Now, my budget is around 650 euro, to 700. After googling and so on, i wanted to get Phillips 5500 series, but then read quite a lot about long time for machine to settle up. So then i switched to **De'Longhi Magnifica Evo Next/Plus,** but then i read something about leaking milk and extensive maintenance.

1oj2hc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheUpcomingTech/comments/1oj2hc2/what_skills_will_be_most_in_demand_in_the_coming/,What Skills Will Be Most in Demand in the Coming Years in Cloud Infrastructure and Data Services,"The job market shifting faster than Wi-Fi signals in a crowded café. Cloud computing and data services, once niche tech corners, have become the lifeblood of modern businesses. Every company, from local startups in Pune to multinational giants in New York, is scrambling to find people who can keep their cloud systems secure, efficient, and scalable.


It’s kind of wild, honestly.


Over the next few years, one thing’s clear: everything that can move to the cloud, will. But what’s less obvious is which skills will actually define the winners.


If you ask around, cloud automation keeps stealing the spotlight. A decade ago, system admins managed servers by hand. Today, tools like Terraform and Kubernetes do the heavy lifting. Knowing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become the new must-have. One senior engineer from Hyderabad told me, If you can script it, you can scale it. l He wasn’t exaggerating. Companies want folks who can make infrastructure behave predictably, almost like software. To be honest, I love that shift; it turns what used to be tedious configuration tasks into creative problem solving.


Data governance is the other big beast. You would think managing data is just about storage, but no, it’s about control, lineage, and compliance. As global privacy laws tighten, knowing how to design policies around data privacy in the cloud has become a deal-maker. Someone who understands how to set up secure data pipelines with tools like Apache Kafka or AWS Glue will never struggle to find work. And do not even get me started on data observability, tracking where data comes from, where it goes, and what happens to it. That’s the new gold standard.


Then there’s the rise of AI integrated cloud operations. Machine learning models are running directly within cloud environments now. Companies expect cloud engineers to understand how ML pipelines connect with platforms like Google Cloud AI or Azure ML. It is not enough to just know EC2 or Kubernetes anymore, you need to grasp how workloads scale for AI. People who blend cloud infrastructure knowledge with AI tooling will dominate the next wave of hiring. No kidding, that blend is becoming as common as having coffee before a meeting.


Security, though, sits right at the top. Every other week, there’s a headline about a data breach or an exposed S3 bucket. Cloud security engineers who can predict vulnerabilities before they explode will be as valuable as good finance heads in the 2000s. Skills in zero-trust architecture, encryption standards, and identity management are booming.


On a more strategic note, cloud architecture will demand both technical and business fluency. A person who can translate business needs into multi-cloud strategies is going to outpace pure coders. I mean, look around, companies are juggling AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud like circus performers. The ability to design hybrid-cloud frameworks, optimize costs, and still ensure performance is becoming the secret power skill.


Soft skills matter too, though we do not talk about them enough. Communication, collaboration, and storytelling, especially when presenting data insights, can turn a techie into a leader. These aren’t nice-to-haves anymore. They’re essential. I have seen talented engineers miss promotions because they could not explain their designs in plain English.


So here is the deal: the cloud world is not just about learning tools its about mastering mindsets. The professionals who stay curious, keep experimenting, and understand how to mix automation, data, and business thinking, those are the ones who will lead the next phase.


And honestly, I find that exciting. Because the more cloud evolves, the more human creativity it actually demands.

A couple of months ago I decided I didn't want to be broke anymore. I'm going to give you a low down on my thoughts so far and i'd love to hear peoples opinions.

I've bought a recurring lottery ticket. I've always wanted to be comfortable for the rest of my life without ever having to question if i can do something financially or not. So winning the lottery sounded like a great option to get to that goal. I'd always dream about winning the lottery but would never buy a lottery ticket haha. It was so WEIRD.

The minute i would go to buy one i'd tell myself there was no point, that i was being ridiculous, that the chances of winning were so minniscule that theres no point, that it was too much faff to set up a recurring ticket. Until i realised theres obviously something I'm afriad of in becoming rich! That's why i keep talking myself out of it!

I'm sort of-ish working on those blocks. I've identified them. i think. I know people use EFT Tapping to clear those blocks away but more advice would be very appreciated! Again, everytime I go to clear those blocks through some tapping, I put it off. Is this me talking myself out of it again?

It is true that my entire mindset is shifting. I almost think now that its inevitable that i win the lottery. Every week so far i've smiled and almost laughed when i see the numbers that have been drawn that don't match my ticket because i feel great about being slightly closer to experiencing the money in my physical reality. It's really fun.

Today i looked at my numbers (i play the euromillions which is 5 numbers + 2 lucky stars. You need all 7 to win the jackpot and the first 5 to win around half a million i think.) and for the first time since buying 1 lottery ticket a week (""luck"" or ""chance"" have nothing to do with it so buying 1 a week is the same as buying 7 a week to me haha) i got a match - my two lucky stars were drawn. There is no money win from this but it made me smile!! it's like the universe is signalling ""you're getting closer!!"" Opinions on this?

I've also listened to Jen Sincero's You Are A Badass at Making Money and i found it fantastic. I try to think of all the ways my life would stay exactly the same if I was completely and forever financially stable and RICH. Does that sound weird? I do it because it makes being rich feel normal, and feel like me. If feels like less of a jump. I'd still have the same best friends. I'd still love going to the park. I'd still enjoy watching sex and the city. I'd still love reading with a cup of tea on the sofa. I'd still like buying a cup of coffee and a pastry on a Sunday and walking around my neighbourhood. etc etc etc

One thing that i am still untangling is how easily and often my thoughts tend to drift off into negative scenario creating. It lowers my vibration which doesn't feel good because it's contrasting what i am manifesting. i'm trying to catch these negative mental movies and switch them off immediately. Then i try to focus on the smallest and most general thing in my life that i feel grateful for. A full deep breath. A glass of water. etc. I picked this up from Abraham Hicks.

Now picture opening another one in a city you have never visited. Exciting, right? But what if no one shows up, or costs suddenly rise? That is the feeling of financial risk when your business dreams meet an unknown market.

You can reduce financial risk by using a test-and-learn approach. Start small before committing big money. Treat it as a pilot test focused on learning about the market rather than building full infrastructure. Try selling a few products online or run a short pop-up shop to see customer reactions.

This step-by-step method works like an insurance policy for your expansion. Prepare a clear budget with backup funds for unexpected costs. Also, work with local experts who understand regional laws and habits.

**Insights**
**Why It Matters**: Protecting Your Core
A poor expansion can drain the funds of your main business. Each new market has its own laws, taxes, and consumer habits. Careful planning and limited spending protect your core operations.

**How It Works in Simple Terms**: Play Level by Level
Break the move into small, testable steps. Like playing a game level by level, try an online launch or short campaign first. Gather data, learn, and adjust before moving further.

**Real-World Perspective**: The Pilot Program
An Indian clothing brand tested one pop-up store in the UAE before expanding. They studied customer responses, made changes, and then scaled up safely.

**A Simple Fact**: Success Rates:- Research shows that businesses running pilot tests before expansion are 40 percent more likely to succeed.

**Micro Takeaway**:- Test small, learn fast, and grow safe to avoid major financial losses.

Nugget ice is soft, chewable, and made of compacted ice flakes, often called Sonic ice. It has a cloudy appearance and absorbs flavors well, making it ideal for iced coffee, smoothies, and cocktails. Its softer texture is gentle on teeth and melts at a moderate pace, providing a pleasant drinking experience for those who like to chew their ice. Nugget ice makers typically produce moderate to high daily outputs; for example, some models make up to 44 pounds per day. They are excellent for users who want textured, versatile ice that complements drink flavors and offers a unique mouthfeel.

In contrast, bullet ice is solid, tube-shaped ice, clear or slightly cloudy, made rapidly in around 6 to 8 minutes. Its shape fits easily in water bottles and narrow cups, and it cools drinks quickly. Bullet ice tends to melt a bit faster but provides fast cooling with less dilution initially. It's favored for quick ice needs and practical use in a variety of drink containers. Bullet ice makers are generally more cost-effective and easier to maintain, producing reliable ice that is gentle on dispensers due to its smooth shape, minimizing jams.

To summarize:

|Feature|Nugget Ice|Bullet Ice|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ice texture|Soft, chewable, flaked|Solid, tube-shaped|
|Melting rate|Moderate|Faster|
|Flavor absorption|High|Low|
|Cooling speed|Moderate|Fast|
|Best for|Iced coffee, cocktails, smoothies|General quick cooling, water bottles, sports drinks|
|Production speed|Slower (minutes to batch)|Faster (6-8 minutes batch)|
|Maintenance & cost|Higher cost, more complex|More cost-effective, easier|

If you prefer soft, flavorful, chewable ice that enhances beverages, nugget ice makers are the way to go. If you prioritize quick ice production and fast cooling with solid ice that fits versatile uses, bullet ice makers serve best.

This head-to-head insight can help decide which ice maker style suits your lifestyle and drink preferences best.",1,1761738248.0,IceMakerMachine,0,1.0,False

1oj297h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oj297h/happy_arc_raiders_eve/,Happy Arc Raiders Eve!,"’Twas the night before launch, and all through the Speranza Sphere,  
Not a player was stirring, no glitch, no fear.  
The Arcs hung in orbit, their cores humming low,  
In hopes that the Raiders would soon steal the show.  

The devs were nestled all snug in their chairs,  
With coffee and code, chasing last-minute scares.  
And Ember in headset, and I in my rig,  
Had just settled in for the pre-download gig.  

When out in the void there arose such a clatter,  
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.  
Away to the window I flew like a flash,  
Tore open the blinds—saw the sky in a crash.  

The moons on the breast of the fractured terrain  
Gave luster of metal to objects arcane.  
When what to my wondering eyes should ignite  
But a sleek dropship fleet, and eight pulsing Arcs in flight.  

With a pilot so nimble, her callsign was “Wick,”  
I knew in a moment—she’d lead the first pick.  
More rapid than bullets, her squadmates they came,  
And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:  

“Now, Jax! Now, Juno! Now, Pike and Vex!  
On, Cora! On, Calder! On, Rune and on Rex!  
To the top of the Arc! To the breach in the wall!  
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!”  

As shrapnel that flies when the Extractors roar,  
When they meet an obstacle, mount to the core—  
So up to the spire the Raiders they flew,  
With a hold full of loot, and Saint Wick in there too.  

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on comms clear  
The clanking and sparking of each little gear.  
As I drew in my breath, and was turning around,  
Down the Arc’s tether Saint Wick came with a bound.  

She was dressed all in nano, from her hood to her boots,  
And her armor was tarnished with ashes and soot.  
A bundle of weapons was flung on her back,  
And she looked like a merc just opening her pack.  

Her eyes—how they glinted! Her visor, how sleek!  
Her cheeks glowed with HUD, her grin sharp and chic.  
Her droll little mouth was drawn up in a smirk,  
And the stubble on chin was as dark as her work.  

The stump of a flare she held tight in her teeth,  
And the smoke it encircled her helm like a wreath.  
She had a lean face and a core of pure steel,  
That thrummed when she laughed, like a turbine’s appeal.  

She was wiry and quick, a right deadly elf,  
And I cheered when I saw her, in spite of myself.  
A wink of her eye and a twist of her head  
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  

She spoke not a word, but went straight to her work,  
And filled all the caches, then turned with a jerk.  
And laying a finger aside of her mask,  
She triggered the beacon—then poof! Gone in a flash.  

She sprang to her ship, to her team gave a whistle,  
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.  
But I heard her exclaim, ’ere she warped out of sight—

She is a dying flame,
She is a broken well in the desert,
With crystal, spring water inside.

She is the very essence of feminine tenderness,
Laid on the chopping block by his indifference.
She is the most pulsating volcano,
Frozen by the neglect of her needs.

She is the wisdom of generations,
She is the breath of wild nature,
She is the brightness of every child’s dream,
And the intoxicating passion with a beast’s growl within.

I called you “чудо”
When we met,
You are “чудо.”
Because I have never met anyone so wonderful,
Not before, not after.

You were pure innocence in its earliest form,
You were faith in a bright future,
You were trembling trust
That no one would ever hurt you.

And I hurt you.
Offended you, betrayed you,
Decided for both of us,
Ignored your needs,
Violated you, used you,
Wiped my feet on you.

You prayed and cried that day,
When frightened, you hid under the table from me.
And I was silent,
Saying I’d never hurt you again, that there would be no more pain,
And then still did what I wanted to do.

Did you want to be with me? Sadly, yes.
Because you always chose those who loved you,
And never the ones you loved.
Did you want such a fate? Surely not.
Would you wish such a man for your daughter?
I think you’d hide her from him in a castle guarded by a dragon.

I’m sorry I turned out not to be a prince,
But an ogre, or maybe even a donkey.
God, what a donkey I am.

A donkey in feelings,
A goat in actions,
A pig in relationships,
A rat in meeting your needs.
You wouldn’t even need a zoo with me,
I am nature itself in its worst state.

I am the one who would grab you by the hair
And carry you into a cave to do whatever he wants.
I am a killer of souls, a poacher, a punisher,
A waiter who’d spill coffee on you
If you didn’t tip him.

How much more you deserve,
And why did you choose me?
You didn’t choose anyone.
You just picked the one
Who said he chose you.

Why do the best people end up with the biggest scoundrels?
And why can I no longer rejoice in that?

My husband had to get up super early for work today and of course he tried not to wake me and tried to sneak out quietly, but it woke me up as well. He left the house already so it’s just me and the dog cuddling in my room with the door shut, pretending there’s not a whole world of stress waiting for me in a few hours outside of that door. I’m just laying here, cuddling the dog, pretending what life would be like if there wasn’t children in this house to tend to. The dog and I would cuddle for a little longer, he’d get all his belly rubs.. I’d throw my favorite slippers on, and head into the kitchen to throw some coffee on. Maybe I’d turn the news on tv, or maybe I’d play my favorite music. I’d actually get to sit down and drink warm coffee, and enjoy the aroma of it. I’d cook myself something healthy for breakfast or have time to make a protein shake. I’d jump in the shower and wash my hair, and finish drinking my shake as I blowdried my hair and did my make up… for once getting to feel cute at work and like I have some pride in my appearance. I’d take the dog out for his walk along the beach like we used to in the mornings. Even if it was just a quick walk, hearing the waves crashing and the seagulls in the morning is always enough to make me feel calm and centered. The drive into work would be less stressful, I wouldn’t be drinking cold coffee and starving. It would be quiet, or perhaps I would listen to a podcast on the way, collecting my thoughts before my long day at work. 
Thoughts would form in my mind as I drove, about how fulfilled I felt.. with my marriage, with my excelling career that I studied so hard for all those years, with my hobbies and my pets. My heart would feel full. I would catch myself stopped at a red light with a smile on my face. I was thinking about how it was a great morning so far. 

Instead, the reality that’s waiting for me outside of those doors in a few hours is waking up, making coffee, waking the kids up, fighting with them to get up for school, getting food out for them on the table, fighting with them to get dressed, throwing my dirty hair I haven’t washed in 2 days in a ponytail, there might be time for some mascara but maybe not, rushing to get dressed myself.. realizing my coffee is cold and I’m going to have to put it in a travel mug for the car to drink cold coffee on the way. Getting kids backpacks ready, rushing everyone out of the door, realizing I haven’t ate anything myself and feeling my empty stomach rumble on the caffeine in the cold cofeee I just slammed, and listening to the kids fight with each other in the back seat as I’m trying to concentrate in traffic. 
That’s not even half of it. When work is finished we gotta get them home, get groceries, cook dinner, do dishes, do laundry, pack lunches, fight with them about getting homework done, fight with them about getting in the tub and getting to bed.. the list goes on and on. 

I often wonder how I got here. Where I got to the place where I thought this would be a fulfilling life. There’s nothing fulfilling about it- it’s monotonous, exhausting, overstimulating, infuriating.. it just fucking sucks. 
But for these next two hours I’m going to lay here and pet the dog and we’re going to dream of a world that exists outside of motherhood before reality, my reality, sets in. 

If you’re one of the fence-sitters that creeps this subreddit.. I beg you, don’t do it. Don’t let your life turn into this. There’s no going back and it’s years and years of this shit. I can’t think of a worse type of torture. A year in prison would feel more rewarding than this. I’d have food, lots of time to myself, and a corner to crawl up and read a book in. That sounds way better than this hell. 
If you stop taking the small stuff for granted, you’ll realize you have a lot of things to make you truly feel fulfilled- quiet time to process your own thoughts and get to know yourself better, endless time for hobbies and interests, the chance to excel at work or continue more education, time for pets or other things that make you happy, a beautiful relationship with a spouse if you want one to share your life with. Time for friends and to feel social, time in nature, time for self-care.. don’t take these things for granted. For us, it’s too late. ",42,1761738147.0,regretfulparents,9,1.0,False

After 87 years in business on West Front Street, iconic downtown diner J&S Hamburg will serve up its final omelets, shakes, and burgers this Sunday. *The Ticker* speaks with owner Cindy Warner about what comes next (hint: another community gathering space is on the horizon) plus shares other business updates from across the region – including a new indoor sports complex coming to Woodmere, multiple coffee shop and retail store changes, and more.

**J&S Hamburg**  
Cindy Warner and her staff are preparing for an emotional last week as they wind down operations at J&S Hamburg at 302 West Front Street. Warner, who has owned the business for 21 years and is just the third owner since the diner opened in 1938, says it’s been “very difficult” preparing for the restaurant’s last day Sunday. “It’s not even bittersweet,” she says. “It’s a huge sadness.”

The closure is necessitated by several factors. The nearly century-old building is “literally falling down” and needs to be rebuilt, Warner says. She [listed the site for sale in 2023](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/a-shake-to-go-iconic-downtown-js-hamburg-for-sale/) but says almost all the interest came “from people out of the area who candidly weren’t familiar with doing business in Traverse City and had pie-in-the-sky ideas that would’ve taken years to accomplish.” Warner didn’t want the property tied up indefinitely in contingent deals; she also hoped for a project that would fit in well downtown.

Ultimately, she decided to redevelop the site herself. Demolition on the property is set to begin in the coming weeks, with construction on a new building planned for next spring (pictured, rendering). Warner plans to build eight condos on the upper floors – one of which she’ll occupy – with enclosed ground-floor parking. Linda Schaub at Real Estate One will represent the new three-bedroom, two-bathroom units. Also planned is a new ground-floor wine bar and retail shop facing Front Street. Noting that other nearby wine sellers close by 6pm, Warner hopes to provide late-evening retail sales and a neighborhood gathering spot for a glass of wine and charcuterie after work. The project is targeted for a June 2027 opening.

Warner says putting J&S into the new building wasn’t feasible for several reasons, including equipment costs and ventilation issues with eight residential units directly overhead. She looked for alternate locations, as did staff – Warner says she offered to gift the business to employees if they could reopen it elsewhere. However, real estate prices ultimately made the numbers impossible. “We’ve done every scenario you could imagine to move it and have it stay in existence,” says Warner. J&S Hamburg will remain open on South Airport Road and in Kingsley – those locations are separately owned by Jason and Tiffany McQueer – while customers can say goodbye to the downtown staff this week and still see Warner in the new building. “I’m not going anywhere,” she says.

**Anchor Point Athletics**  
Parents and athletes looking for a year-round, indoor sports facility will soon have an answer near downtown Traverse City. Kevin and Melissa Olds are planning to open [**Anchor Point Athletics**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61582304644480) – a 5,000-square-foot multi-sport training facility with fresh turf, modular training areas, batting cages, and a HitTrax system – within the next month at 1145 Woodmere Avenue (formerly CrossFit). The Olds, who have a daughter in softball and have long struggled to find reliable winter locations for practices, were alerted to the space by neighboring business owner Shawn Esther and assisted on building renovations by Chris Vandergriff and Bill Gaylord of TC Waves.

Anchor Point Athletics will offer online scheduling software allowing individuals or teams to book practice times, with various membership and multi-session packages available. While Kevin Olds says the primary draw will likely be for softball/baseball players to start, he hopes to eventually accommodate everything from lacrosse and soccer drills to senior movement classes to community programs like yoga. “We intend to offer a lot more as we grow,” he says. While both [the YMCA](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/ymca-prepares-for-major-expansion/) and [Traverse City Area Public Schools](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/tcaps-eyes-173m-fieldhouse-near-east-middle-school/) are also eyeing future indoor sports complexes, Anchor Point Athletics will be the first facility of its kind online in Traverse City – saving parents a considerable drive to outlying regions, according to Olds. “Being right near downtown will be a game changer for this community,” he says.

**More Openings, Closings, and Moves…**  
Several new coffee shops are opening their doors, while one is relocating. **Trailside Café** recently opened at Logan’s Landing off South Airport Road, offering “organic coffee, energizing smoothies, and delightful breakfast bites” along the Boardman Lake Loop Trail. In Fife Lake, Katie Kniss is preparing for a Saturday grand opening of **State Street Coffee** at 108 West State Street – a building that shares space with The Quilter’s Clinic (owned by Kniss’s mother) and Fife Lake Barbershop. Kniss will offer coffee and espresso drinks, teas, chai, breakfast sandwiches, and pastries with free WiFi in a “comfortable eclectic cottage atmosphere,” she says. Online ordering will soon be available, along with curbside pick-up from 7am-9am.

In Traverse City, owner MaryAnne MacIntosh is planning a tentative November 11 opening date for a new **Biggby Coffee** location in the former bank drive-thru building in the Tom’s West Bay plaza off South West Bay Shore Drive. The coffee shop will have a drive-thru, lobby, a variety of seating, and a meeting conference room with free WiFI for paying customers, plus a variety of coffee drinks and food options. The business will be donating $1 from each drink sold its first week to nonprofit PoWer! Book Bags. Further down the Parkway, **Mojo’s Coffee** announced it will cease operations behind the Elks Lodge and move back to its original location in Kingsley at H&R Block on Cougar Trail starting this week.

Two new retail stores are coming to the downtown TC area. After being in Suttons Bay, **Laughing Fish Gallery** has found a new home in The Village at Grand Traverse Commons offering a “whimsical collection of hand-carved fish, woodland creatures, vibrant tapestries, and more,” plus an Art Café for maker projects. The store is planning a grand opening Saturday. At 204 East Front Street, Michele Bosscher plans to open new women’s store **Serendipity** – which also has locations in Cadillac and Big Rapids – in the former FatFace space this weekend. Bosscher says the store will offer “cute, easy-to-wear styles, cozy layers, and thoughtful gifts.”

On the restaurant front, **Crocodile Palace** held its last day of operations Sunday at its brick-and-mortar location on Cochlin Street. The business will still be operating out of The Little Fleet, however, “bringing some of our Cochlin favorites and the same energy that’s always driven us,” owners Patrick and Michael Evans wrote in a Facebook post. On the other side of downtown, the **Blue Tractor** – which [closed in August](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/blue-tractor-hexenbelle-closing-more-restaurantretail-news/) – [has been listed for sale on Union Street for $2.7 million](https://nglrmls.com/listings/commercial/city/grand-traverse-county/1939884) ($2.2 million for the real estate and $500,000 for the liquor license). Owner Jon Carlson of Mission Restaurant Group previously told *The Ticker* a new concept was planned for the space. “We still think we have a plan to partner with an amazing concept, but thought it was best to also see what options are out there,” he said by email this week. “It is too amazing of a spot to not have ready and back open by next summer.”

Finally, a new four-seasons music pavilion is under construction outside **Lake Ann Brewing Company**. Owner Matt Therrien says the structure will feature “lots of glass garage doors, a spacious porch, large music stage, and new bathroom facility on the patio. It will essentially function as the (previous) tent did, with nothing changing to our original outdoor stage and grassy area.” The music pavilion is expected to open in December.",5,1761738066.0,traversecity,4,1.0,False

A Beginner’s Guide to AI Writing,"If you’ve ever found yourself staring at a blank page, unsure of what to write, you’re not alone. Writing for your blog, business, or school takes time and creativity. That’s where WordHero, an AI writing tool, comes in. It helps you create quality content in minutes instead of hours.

Let’s break it down simply.

What Exactly Is WordHero?  

WordHero is an AI writing assistant that helps you generate text quickly. Think of it as a digital co-writer that never tires. You enter a few details, and it produces well-written sentences, paragraphs, or even full articles. 

It’s powered by language models trained on a large amount of text from the internet. But you don’t need to worry about the tech behind it. Just tell WordHero what you need, like “write a product description for a coffee brand” or “create a blog intro about digital marketing,” and it immediately delivers something readable and useful.

How WordHero Helps You Write Better and Faster  

Here’s how it works in everyday situations:  

For bloggers: Instead of spending hours brainstorming ideas, you can ask WordHero to generate 10 blog topics in seconds.  

For business owners: Need social media captions, emails, or ad copy? WordHero can draft them instantly, saving you time and mental energy.

1oj20cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oj20cn/aio_my_coworker_accused_me_of_sleeping_at_work/,AIO - My coworker accused me of sleeping at work and took a photo of me without my permission,"Gonna explain this as best as I can so let me know if there's anything that confuses you

To protect the identity of an individual, I changed his name to Evil Larry bc I need some sort of laugh out of this situation

I work at a learning disability company and mostly do night shifts at a residence with 3 gentlemen due to the decent hours and how it works with my schedule (I also have a little brother that I babysit often). There is also always a sleep staff member that sleeps overnight at their home in the event of an emergency where night staff need to leave the building (such as supporting an individual to the hospital)

Alongside various cleaning tasks, every hour we have to do checks on all the individuals by scanning a barcode *inside* their room. Each barcode is unique to an individual and locks in the time that you scan it, it's the only way we do night checks to ensure they're actually being done and you aren't sitting around the whole time. You can change the times with anything else *except* night checks

Yesterday I was doing a night shift, I had completed all my tasks and it's pretty chill after that. I relax, watch something and adhere to the hourly night checks

At around 4am I started to feel tired (Mind you, it's a 10 hour shift starting from 9pm - 7am), so I decided to rest my eyes because it helps alleviate the tiredness, I was *fully* aware of my surroundings and knew I was not falling asleep.

About 2 mins later I can hear my coworker (sleep staff) leave the guest bedroom and my eyes are still closed so I assumed she went to the bathroom. I hear the guest room door close again and sit there for maybe 5 more mins before I get up to make a coffee.

I didn't think anything of it at the time, but today, after my second night shift, she came in for a morning shift and immediately accused me of sleeping at work, which is smth my anxiety wouldn't let me do if I tried

She hasn't done a night shift since the barcode system was implemented so she claimed I had slept the whole time and faked doing night checks (which is literally impossible), I explained this to her, even tried to show her proof they were done at the correct times n she just tried backtracking to ""well you still shouldn't be sleeping because I'm a light sleeper and Evil Larry  kept making noise""

Again, I was not sleeping, I heard her leave the guest room and had no idea she was actually taking a photo of me. Evil Larry was being *particularly* verbal that night, I had been to his room several times and figured he would settle if I stopped giving him attention, which worked

Anyway, I immediately grabbed my phone to ask my manager if we could talk bc i was livid and felt embarrassed due to there being 2 other coworkers there
She must've looked over my shoulder and seen I was texting someone from work bc she quickly said ""There's no need to take it up to management or anything, just be careful because someone else might report you. I won't because I'm nice"" VERBATIM and then she started laughing. No you are NOT NICE

Do you expect me to thank you for not reporting something that didn't fucking happen? I don't want to be THIS angry bc I'm not in any trouble but I've been working to the fucking bone this past week, that was the last thing I needed

I'm not a minor (20yrs) but I have massive boundaries around people taking photos of me, even when I'm aware of it. I'm completely uncomfortable with her now and right before I left she almost tried to play it off like a joke, she knew she was in the wrong. I chose not to message my manager but what are your guys thoughts?

Also side note: If she really thought I was sleeping then why wouldn't she tap my shoulder or try to wake me up? I know damn well she didn't try because I awake the whole fucking time 🫠

Either way, I have 3 different springs to install to compare to the original on the machine. I love the coffee, but I am looking for more of a syrup looking brew. I keep seeing these on the internet and I really want my coffee to be thicker compared to the watery brew I have today. Is installing the spring really going to make this big of a change? If so, what do you recommend (mm?) and if not, what can I do? Also, is there a tutorial online?

Most beginners don’t need a big stack. Fix the “basics” first (sleep timing, stress load, caffeine timing, movement). If you still want extra help, introduce **one** well-studied option at a time and track what changes. For timing, see [**Best Time to Take Nootropics**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics). If stress is the handbrake on your focus, use [**Reduce Stress for Better Focus (Simple Steps)**](https://herbalnootropics.life/reduce-stress-focus-guide). Curious about evaluating blends? Here’s a neutral walk-through with a real label: [**SynaBoost Natural Nootropic — Full Review**](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/synaboost-natural-nootropic-review).

>

# What “nootropics” really do (and don’t)

“Nootropic” is a broad umbrella for things that may help cognition, mood, or mental energy. A realistic starting point:

* Effects are **context-dependent**. The same dose that helps a stressed student at 8am can backfire for a tired parent at 9pm.
* Most options are **subtle, cumulative, and conditional** on the basics: sleep, light, food, hydration, and movement.
* No pill replaces **training the skill** you want (e.g., focused work, revision technique, or stress coping).

You’ll get the best signal-to-noise by *controlling variables* first, then introducing one change at a time. That’s how you learn what’s helping *you*—not what helped a stranger on the internet.

# Before pills: the 80/20 “basics” that multiply any supplement’s effect

Think of these as **inputs** that make every other decision easier. They’re simple, not easy—and they’re where most of the payoff lives.

1. **Sleep timing (same wake-up every day)**
   * Aim for 6.5–8+ hours where possible.
   * Get **morning daylight** for 5–10 minutes to anchor your body clock.
   * **Caffeine cut-off**: at least 8 hours before bed (earlier if you’re sensitive).
   * Timing guide for everything you take: [**Best Time to Take Nootropics**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics)
2. **Stress load**
   * Treat stress like a dimmer, not a switch. Insert **one** 3–5 minute decompression ritual after lunch (walk, box breathing, micro-stretches).
   * Practical playbook: [**Reduce Stress for Better Focus**](https://herbalnootropics.life/reduce-stress-focus-guide)
3. **Food & hydration**
   * **Protein at breakfast** steadies energy (eggs, Greek yoghurt, tofu scramble).
   * **Fibre & water**: vegetables, berries, oats; and sip water with each coffee/tea.
4. **Movement**
   * **Brisk walking** (10–20 min) after meals helps alertness.
   * **Twice-weekly resistance training** supports energy, sleep, and mood—no gym heroics required.

>

# Do you even need supplements yet? (Decision path)

\[ \] Do I average 6.5–8 hours of sleep?

\[ \] Do I have a daily stress tool (breathing/walk/journal) I actually use?

\[ \] Is my caffeine timed (none past mid-afternoon)?

\[ \] Do I move (walks + 2x light resistance) most weeks?

* **If you ticked “no” on two or more**, fix the basics first. You’ll feel better *and* any supplement will work more predictably.
* **If you ticked “yes” on most**, you’ve earned the right to test **one** option and see if it adds something meaningful.

# If you add something, start with “safe, simple, studied”

**Golden rule:** change *one thing at a time* for 10–14 days. Log sleep hours, stress (1–10), and focus (1–10). If nothing improves—or sleep worsens—revert.

# Quick-reference: beginner options, doses & timing

|Option (start low)|Why beginners try it|Typical amount (general info)|Timing notes|What to watch|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Caffeine + L-Theanine**|Smoother focus; reduces jitters from coffee/tea|Caffeine 50–150 mg + L-theanine 100–200 mg|Morning or early-afternoon; avoid evenings|Too late → sleep disruption|
|**Creatine Monohydrate**|Mental energy on demanding days; physical benefits too|3–5 g daily (no need to “load”)|Anytime; with water; stay hydrated|Mild water retention in some|
|**Magnesium (glycinate/threonate)**|Wind-down & sleep quality|200–300 mg **elemental Mg** in evening|Evening routine (1–2 h before bed)|Loose stools if too much|
|**Bacopa monnieri (standardised)**|Long-horizon memory & learning|300 mg/day of extract (≈20–24% bacosides)|Daily, with food; give it 4–8 weeks|Can feel sedating for some|
|**Rhodiola rosea (std.)**|Stressful days; resilience|100–200 mg (e.g., 3% rosavins/1% salidroside)|Morning / early-afternoon|Too late can feel activating|
|**Lion’s Mane (fruiting-body extract)**|Subtle clarity; long-term support|500–1,000 mg 1–2× daily|Morning and/or early afternoon|Very subtle; give it weeks|

>

# How to run a clean 10–14 day test

1. **Pick one** option from the table.
2. **Write a one-line hypothesis** (“I expect fewer jitters and steadier focus in the morning”).
3. **Set your timing** (e.g., 08:30 with breakfast).
4. **Track**: sleep hours, stress 1–10, focus 1–10, and any side-effects.
5. **Protect sleep**: if it worsens, adjust cut-off or stop.
6. **Decide** on Day 14: keep, tweak, or ditch.

# Micro-stacks for everyday goals (minimal, beginner-friendly)

**Study / deep-work block (90–120 min)**

* Morning: a coffee/tea + **L-theanine 100–200 mg**.
* Environment: timer, phone out of reach, noise control.
* Mid-block: 2–3 minutes of standing or a short walk, water.
* **Timing reminder:** avoid late blocks if they push caffeine too close to bedtime → [**timing guide**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics).

**Back-to-back meetings / cognitively heavy day**

* Lower caffeine, add **theanine** for smoothness.
* Water at every calendar alert; stand 5–10 minutes each hour.
* Micro-breathing between calls (four slow cycles).

**Sleep-first reset (48 hours)**

* No caffeine after late morning; **magnesium** with evening routine.
* Morning light + an easy 15-minute walk.
* Warm shower or bath 1–2 hours before bed.
* If stress is the bottleneck, start here: [**Reduce Stress for Better Focus**](https://herbalnootropics.life/reduce-stress-focus-guide).

A simple 14-day beginner plan (paste & tick as you go)

|Day|Sleep (hrs)|Caffeine cut-off|Stress tool used?|Steps/Walk?|Supplement (name & time)|Focus 1–10|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|6||||||||
|7||||||||
|**Switch on ONE supplement from Day 8**||||||||
|8||||||||
|9||||||||
|10||||||||
|11||||||||
|12||||||||
|13||||||||
|14||||||||

**How to review on Day 14:**

* Keep if you saw **consistent** gains in focus or reduced overwhelm **without** sleep cost.
* Tweak timing if afternoon slump improved but bedtime slipped (see: [**Best Time to Take Nootropics**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics)).
* Ditch if nothing changed or sleep worsened—congratulations, you learned something useful.

# Measuring progress at home (so you’re not guessing)

You don’t need a lab. Use low-effort checks that match everyday life:

* **Daily 30-second log** (what you ticked above).
* **One-minute typing or math warm-up** before work to notice “mental friction”.
* **Two-minute recall** (write 10 nouns you saw earlier in a news article).
* **Weekly review prompts** (5 minutes, once a week):
   * What helped most this week? What obviously hurt?
   * What will I keep, adjust, or stop next week?

If stress keeps drowning your plan, pull the lever that moves everything else: [**Reduce Stress for Better Focus**](https://herbalnootropics.life/reduce-stress-focus-guide).



# Common beginner mistakes (and quick fixes)

* **Adding too many things at once.** *Fix:* One change per 10–14 days. Otherwise you’re guessing.
* **Late stimulants.** *Fix:* Move all caffeine to the morning/lunch window. See [**timing guide**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics).
* **Mega-dosing “because I don’t feel it.”** *Fix:* Most useful options are *subtle*. You want reliable calm focus, not fireworks.
* **Ignoring sleep while chasing focus.** *Fix:* Sleep is the amplifier. Protect it first, then layer.
* **Buying under-dosed mystery blends.** *Fix:* Prefer transparent labels with standardised extracts and sensible doses (more on that below).



# How to evaluate a premade blend (fast, fair, practical)

Here’s a 60-second label check to keep you out of the weeds:

1. **Transparency:** are all ingredient amounts listed (no “proprietary blend” catch-alls)?
2. **Standardisation:** for botanicals, are actives listed (e.g., “Rhodiola rosea, 3% rosavins/1% salidroside”)?
3. **Sensible doses:** do amounts roughly align with evidence-based ranges (see the table above)?
4. **Stimulant stacking:** beware of multiple stimulants layered together (caffeine + yohimbine + synephrine = likely too “hot” for beginners).
5. **Testing & sourcing:** third-party testing, clear origin, and batch/lot info inspire confidence.

If you want to see a concrete example of an evaluation that applies these checks neutrally, here’s a walkthrough: [**SynaBoost Natural Nootropic — Full Review**](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/synaboost-natural-nootropic-review).



# Timing matters more than most people think

Even the right thing at the wrong time can backfire. Practical cues:

* **Morning:** best for anything activating (caffeine, rhodiola, theanine with coffee).
* **Midday:** fine for theanine or creatine; be careful with additional caffeine.
* **Late afternoon/evening:** avoid stimulants; reserve **magnesium** or calming routines.
* **Cut-off:** earlier than you think—especially if your sleep is sensitive.

For a deeper dive on aligning timing with your day, see [**Best Time to Take Nootropics**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics).



# Safety notes (when to pause or stop)

* Stop immediately if you experience significant side-effects (palpitations, unusual anxiety, gastrointestinal upset that doesn’t settle).
* Talk to a clinician if you’re on medication (especially SSRIs, SNRIs, anticoagulants, blood-pressure meds), pregnant, or have a medical condition.
* Don’t combine multiple stimulants until you understand your response to each alone.
* Buy from reputable sources; be wary of miracle claims and ultra-cheap “high potency” powders with no testing.



# FAQs (snippet-friendly answers)

**Do nootropics actually work?**  
Some do, for some goals, in some people—especially when the basics are in place. You’ll notice this is about *fit* (right tool, right timing, right person) rather than hype.

**What’s the best first nootropic?**  
Often **caffeine + L-theanine** (if you tolerate caffeine). If sleep is your weak link, start with **magnesium** and a proper wind-down routine instead.

**How long until I feel something?**

* Stimulants and theanine: **minutes to hours**.
* Creatine and Lion’s Mane: **days to weeks**.
* Bacopa: **weeks** (long-horizon memory).

**Can I take them daily?**  
Depends on the ingredient. Many people use creatine or magnesium daily; some cycle stimulants; others keep “toolbox” options only for demanding days.

**When should I take them?**  
Morning for focus; keep stimulating things away from evenings. See: [**Best Time to Take Nootropics**](https://herbalnootropics.life/best-time-to-take-nootropics).

**I’m stressed and it’s wrecking my focus—what now?**  
Start with a **stress-first** reset: shorter caffeine window, movement, and a tiny daily decompression ritual. Here’s a practical plan: [**Reduce Stress for Better Focus**](https://herbalnootropics.life/reduce-stress-focus-guide).



# A tiny, realistic starter pack (no fluff)

If you want the absolute minimum that covers most beginners:

* **One** morning coffee/tea + **L-theanine 100–200 mg**
* **Creatine 3–5 g** daily (optional, especially if you train)
* **Magnesium 200–300 mg elemental** in the evening
* **Daily walk** \+ **consistent wake-up time**
* **Hard cut-off** for caffeine 8+ hours before bed

**Run this for 14 days** using the tracking table above. If sleep improves and morning focus stabilises, you’re winning. If not, adjust timing (see the guide), or drop what isn’t pulling its weight.



# How the community can help (and how you can help them)

* Share **what you tried first**, your baseline habits, and your 14-day summary (what you kept, adjusted, or ditched).
* If you reply to others, ask about **timing and sleep** before suggesting more supplements.
* Got a label you’re unsure about? Apply the 60-second check above and post your reasoning (not just the conclusion).

**Final word:**  
Beginner nootropics aren’t about building a flashy stack; they’re about removing friction from your day. Get the basics right, use timing to your advantage, and experiment *slowly*. The best result is boring: steady energy, smoother focus, and better sleep—on most days. That’s what “working” looks like.",1,1761737287.0,cognitivesupport,0,1.0,False

1oj1x4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1oj1x4a/the_time_a_customer_gave_me_a_tip_and_it_went/,The time a customer gave me a tip and it went straight to the company,"Still seething about this one.

I work in a large chain liquor store. As you might imagine Christmas is nuts. You can't move without bumping into a customer. At one point in all the chaos a customer with a bunch of kids needed help to his car. He's literally holding his baby so I've got his bags.

At his car he tells me he used to work in retail and knows how hard it is. He hands me a $50 tip. 

I was shocked. I said that's so kind but no, I can't accept tips. He says please take it then shoves it in my hands and walks away.

So I'm standing in a carpark with a $50 and you don't need to tell me I should have held onto that sucker tightly. I KNOW. But the rub is I was wearing stupid lady pants without pockets and would have to walk through the building with a $50 note while in my work uniform probably getting stopped by every customer before I could make it to the back. I was worried about how suss that might look and whether I'd get in trouble, so stupid me- I decided to be honest. 

I first bump into my ASM and say look, I tried not to take this but he shoved it in my hands. Maybe we could put it in the charity donation tin, or you could buy coffee for the team?

For some reason my ASM freaked out like it was this huge deal and said they would talk to the manager. They come back later to tell me the big boss says we put it in the safe, and if the customer doesn't change their mind and come back for it within 2 weeks I can have it. Sweet!

2 weeks go by and I could really use that money. I'm literally skipping meals at this point.

I tell my boss it's been two weeks and he laughs and says something like ""wow, you're eager. You know most manager's here wouldn't even let you keep that? Can you wait a few more weeks just to be safe?""

Not really, but sure, yes boss.

So a few weeks go by and one time I'm counting the safe and I notice there's not like a separate $50 with a note or anything. I ask my ASM what she did with it. She says she just stuck it in the safe... with all the other $50s...

The thing is we're a large store so it's not uncommon for the safe to be up or down. As with many of you when that's the case, we make sure the safe balances even if it leaves the tills up or down.

I know many of you are probably thinking- one of your bosses took the money. I genuinely don't believe that. The risk is not worth the reward. Cameras are pointed directly at the safe... too much oversight. Neither of my bosses need a $50 that bad.

I myself have counted the safe many times when it's up or down and if I found an extra $50 I would 100% just transfer it to the till. I have no doubt in my mind that's what happened.

So to recap, last Christmas a busy guy with three daughters appreciated the effort we put in so much he decided to do a nice deed and give away his hard earned $50... and it landed in the hands of a corporation that made 10 billion dollars last year. 

What gets me is that the first thing I suggested was that we give it to charity. I would have been bummed I couldn't keep it but literally anything else would be better than that. If I was that man and found that out, I would be fucking livid.

Anyway... good luck with the upcoming holiday season.",10,1761737149.0,retailhell,8,1.0,False

I’ve been working remotely for a while now, and it still amazes me how much the idea of “remote work” has changed over the last few years.

At first, everyone treated it like a temporary trend — something that would fade once offices reopened. But now? It’s becoming a completely different way of living and working.

And honestly, it’s not just about being able to work from home (or from a beach, or a coffee shop). It’s about rethinking how we work altogether.

Remote work teaches you things that offices never could:

* You learn how to manage *yourself*, not just your time.
* Communication suddenly matters more than meetings.
* Productivity becomes about outcomes, not hours.
* And you realize that flexibility doesn’t mean working less — it means working smarter.

I’ve run a small café for \~6 years. Tourists ask for clearer menus, and staff waste time explaining “what is it / why the price.”

***So I built a tiny tool that turns a photo menu into bilingual item cards with short explanations.***

**How I use it (takes me \~3 minutes for \~30 items):**

Upload menu photo → pick target language → it auto-generates bilingual cards with short tags/explanations → I edit 2–3 tricky lines → share a link or export a print-ready image.

**Where it actually helps (vs straight translation):**

OCR with context: photo/handwritten → text + light completion (not just raw OCR).

F&B-aware phrasing: tags pull from an F&B knowledge base (ingredients, taste, method, scenario).

Usable output: structured item cards → online share link or print image.

Consistency: keeps a private knowledge base so updates are easy.

**Checklist (when it’s a fit):**

Your menu is a photo (messy is okay).

Need Chinese/English ↔ EN/JP/KR/TH/ES/FR/DE/IT → CN/EN.

You want tags/explanations, not just literal translation.

You’ll share on IG/TikTok/Maps or print a sheet.

You can review a few lines after AI.

**Why it converts better for us:**

Tags answer “what is it / why the price” at a glance, and the sectioned layout makes ordering faster.

What I’d love feedback on:

Onboarding: where do you get stuck (photo → cards → share/print)?

Tag taxonomy: are the defaults (ingredients / flavor / method / scenario) useful or noisy?

Privacy: is a private “store knowledge base” for items/tags valuable enough to keep using?

Would you want non-CN/EN pairs (e.g., JP↔KR) in practice?

1oj1tg6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oj1tg6,"Bought a bad pumpkin, larvae in car now prob. Thx Walmart","Hours ago (around 8:50 or 9 pm) I did some mild shopping at walmart, and got a pumpkin. It's been nearly two decades since I carved a pumpkin and this year wanted to get into the Halloween spirit. (Western Nevada bordering Cali)

Load it up in the trunk without a bag, had to jump to another store, then load it in the backseat of my car realizing it was kinda all over the place in the trunk.

But while at the store, it was leaking incrementally that I easily didn't notice. Considering walmart (least the ones here) can be a little dirty at times cause that's just how ppl and things go in public places. I wasn't paying attention when I put it on the self checkout counter. Picked it up, and there was a brown puddle. Thought it prob was someone's coffee that just didn't get cleaned before I came and cleaned off the bottom of the pumpkin with a wetwipe from the entrance area.

After coming home around 9:30 I left it on a table for about like, 15ish minutes and checked to make sure no liquids. Sure enough, brown puddle again. Welp, this pumpkin is a dud I figure. Gotta return or exchange it when I can in a couple days. With no other idea where to put a leaky pumpkin, I figured the bathtub would be an ok temp spot for the moment.

Hours later (about 5 hours) I remembered about the gourd after doing a bunch of other things, and went to lookup why a pumpkin would be leaking and have a hole. After coming across dozens of bugs, it was like 'Oh. Oh shit.. that probably means....' and then went to the bathroom and lifted it up. Yep, a bunch of wriggly little white worm fellas, around 10ish more or less.

Apparently walmart missed a pumpkin, or some, that have a bunch of Squash Vine Borer larvae in them. Nooow I'll have to spray bugspray all over my backseat and trunk to kill off whatevers there and just, scrub around and look through stuff I have in there (A pair of boots, bound up windshield sun protector thing, work vest, et'cetera). With how statistics are looking I'm hoping the 10ish in the tub after lots of long hours means there's gonna be significantly less in the car.

Now for anyone asking 'didn't you check the pumpkin??,' I thought I did. See I didn't know until now what to look for. There was a weird hole in the bottom of it but I wasn't sure how normal it was for it's size or other. No cracks or anything like it and it didn't seem to be dripping when lookin or anything. Plus the self checkout counter and me not looking at it beforehand by mistake being absent minded. Only after reading up on the bug I got a closer look at the stem, which revealed tiny holes at the top with this one bigger one folded in on itself a bit. Easy to miss the stem one if not knowing about it. The hole on the bottom of the pumpkin, I can't excuse that much besides not being familiar with them or other squashes or gourds over a long span of my life.

I will admit bad on me, I should've paid attention better in a lot of aspects. But also, why the was this just out on the storefront? I mean without being Karren-esque and noting my experience I can see it happening with the leakage being mild and hard to notice, and other people of similar nature and living having not much experience with this kind of produce. Even still, I'm not sure. Maybe their produce department needs mild work, but eh

Just, a learning experience I suppose. Still, just, damn. Gotta do a bunch of cleaning and run another errand to take it back for a refund. If there's any plastic pumpkins left, think I'm just gonna go with that rip

WELL it has been 2 years and my memory is still destroyed. While it is definitely better than it was during/a few months out of the treatment course, I can not remember conversations I have with people for the life of me. I can remember things like songs, how to paint, books I read, how to do a math problem, but I will tell people the same story 3-4 times, ask the same questions over and over, and even not remember emotional comments people close to me make.

Okay y’all… I just have to share this because I swear Mark Klimek single-handedly saved my sanity.

Before discovering his lectures, my test anxiety was brutal. I’d blank out, overthink every question, and walk out of exams feeling like I got hit by a truck. No amount of coffee, flashcards, or study groups could fix the panic that set in the moment I saw “select all that apply.” 😩

Then I started listening to Mark Klimek’s NCLEX lectures, and something clicked. The way he explains concepts makes everything logical instead of memorized. He doesn’t just throw content at you—he teaches you how to think like the NCLEX. Suddenly, potassium levels, psych drugs, delegation, and prioritization weren’t scary anymore. It was like he turned chaos into calm.

What really killed my anxiety was how his lectures gave me confidence through understanding. Instead of cramming, I actually knew the material. His “if you see this, pick that” rules, his mnemonics, his humor—it all made things stick.

By the time I sat for my last exam, I wasn’t panicking. I was thinking, “What would Mark say?” 😂 And for the first time ever, I finished an exam calm.

If you’re struggling with test anxiety or feeling lost in your NCLEX prep, please do yourself a favor and listen to Mark Klimek. His lectures didn’t just prepare me for tests—they gave me back my confidence. 💛",5,1761736493.0,Markknclex,0,1.0,False

qualche mese fa avevamo pubblicato qui un post intitolato “Ho costruito un prototipo di macchina del caffè portatile: feedback benvenuti!”.
Da allora il progetto sta crescendo, e volevamo condividere un aggiornamento.

Prima di tutto, grazie a tutti quelli che avevano commentato nel thread precedente. Abbiamo letto ogni messaggio e ci sono stati davvero utili: molti di voi hanno dato consigli tecnici, idee pratiche o semplicemente incoraggiamenti che ci hanno aiutato a migliorare il prototipo.
E, sinceramente, non ci aspettavamo così tanto interesse. Ci ha fatto davvero piacere.

Per chi non aveva visto il post originale: il progetto si chiama SORSO, ed è una macchina del caffè portatile e modulare pensata per poter preparare un espresso o una moka ovunque.
L’idea è quella di un dispositivo compatto e ricaricabile, smontabile in più moduli (per esempio: riscaldamento dell’acqua, erogazione, tipo di caffè), così da adattarsi a diverse esigenze e situazioni.

A metà ottobre siamo stati alla Maker Faire di Roma, dove abbiamo portato il nostro prototipo.
Abbiamo parlato con un sacco di persone, raccolto suggerimenti interessanti e anche diversi consigli tecnici su materiali, pressione e soluzioni meccaniche. È stato molto utile per capire dove possiamo migliorare e come far evolvere il progetto.

Adesso abbiamo preparato un breve questionario per continuare a raccogliere opinioni, idee e preferenze su cosa le persone si aspettano da una macchina del caffè portatile. Se vi va di compilarlo, ci aiutereste molto.

Turns out, it became the perfect stress test for what a modern product information management (PIM) setup should feel like.

I used a headless PIM (Crystallize) to model products, manage variants (like grind type, size, and region), handle pricing in multiple currencies, and tell rich origin stories right inside the catalog. Instead of fighting rigid CMS structures or clunky spreadsheets, everything flowed—structured, flexible, and API-first.

What surprised me most wasn’t the tech (though GraphQL + structured shapes were *chef’s kiss*). It was how fast I could go from idea → catalog → storefront → campaign. And how easy it was to keep the data clean across channels, markets, and formats.

If you’re a dev, marketer, or founder trying to bridge storytelling and structure in commerce, this post might give you a few new tricks to try—or at least spark some ideas.

This morning I ran errands with my teenage daughter, and she thought it was funny that I wasn’t my usual chatty self. 

Normally, at this hour I’d be a little tipsy and stopping to say hi to everyone in the neighbourhood, store owners, familiar faces, even strangers; making silly comments about someone’s jacket or asking what kind of coffee they ordered. 

It’s mortifying for a teenager. Today I had no desire to make small talk. “Dad, are you okay? Are you mental or something? 

You’re not saying hi to anyone,” she asked. 

I replied simply, “I’m good. I’ve entertained the neighborhood enough. I’m glad to run errands today — I’ll wave to people, but I’m tired of being chatty for no reason. Shall we go home and watch a show or do a puzzle?

Her date took her to Giraffe Centre and she went online to sneer, claiming that a date with giraffes is too childish.

Naturally, a frenzied discussion has erupted questioning the entire concept of a date, particularly (I'm assuming) among heterosexuals.

I have lived in cultures where it perfectly the norm to have a walk in the park as the first date. And should any food be involved, usually it's only a cup of coffee and nine out of ten times, the couple will go dutch.

But from what I see in the 254, hapa ni kama the concept of the first date is not to gauge your compatibility and how easily you can converse with the other person. Instead of using it as a chance to get to know each other, from the discussions I'm seeing, it seems as if the first date is used by the man to show off how much he can spend within the hour (an indicator of disposable income), and by the woman to tick off a bucket list of swanky places she has always aspired to visit and post about. This is a generalisation and I admit that I might be wrong, feel free to correct me.

What's your idea of a perfect first date? If you're in a committed relationship, how was your first date experience? Have you ever put a halt to a budding relationship because the first date did not meet your expectations?

As an addendum, why don't you try an anti-date of sorts. The classic walk in the park, I think Uhuru Park in Nairobi's cbd can do just fine. It can be kept lowkey even in terms of food and drinks, ice-cream incase it's hot, or a cup of coffee if the weather seems as scorned as it looks today.

Most looked identical. The ones that went viral? They broke every rule.

Here are the ones that caught my eye and what I think made them work:

**1. Edlog: “We’re building AI for couches.”**

Yes, that’s the real opening line. A guy in an ‘80s suit, smoking a cigarette, talking about AI for couches.

It sounds absurd, and that’s why it worked. Total pattern break. Turns out it’s actually an AI platform for furniture retailers.

*Lesson:* Weird works. If people stop scrolling to figure out whether you’re joking, you’ve already won.



**2. Emergent Labs: “Everyone’s got an idea.”**

Two founders talking over coffee about how everyone wants to build something. Then: *“What if you had an on-demand CTO who actually ships?”*

It’s authentic, founder-led, and perfectly timed for the AI-coding moment.

*Lesson:* Relatability beats production value every time.



**3. ULearn: Just a founder talking to camera**

No fancy effects. No voiceover. Just the founder explaining the product and screen-sharing how it works.

It shouldn’t work, but it feels honest.

*Lesson:* Authentic > perfect. When you’re genuinely excited about what you built, people feel it.



**Bonus: Snowglobe (Guardrails AI): The self-driving car metaphor**

The video opens with: *""This car was tested on millions of scenarios before I could ever ride in it. What if you could test your AI agent on thousands of simulated scenarios before you launch them?""*

It's a talking-head format (founder Shreya on camera), but the hook is a visual metaphor that makes AI agent testing instantly understandable. Self-driving cars → AI agents. Testing simulator → Snow Globe.

The video hit 2M+ views because it made something complex feel familiar.

*Lesson:* When you're explaining technical products, find the metaphor everyone already understands. Self-driving cars are universally known. The bridge between them is what made this stick.



Across all of these, one thing stands out: **execution matters as much as the idea.** The difference between a launch that flops and one that hits 2M views? Usually the team behind the camera.

I’m 18, and it feels like my life is just an endless circle that keeps getting worse every day.
Last summer, while my friends were out traveling, laughing, living their youth, I was waking up at noon, going to private lessons, and hitting the gym at night not to build muscle, just because I was bored and didn’t know what else to do.

Now it’s ten times worse.
School from 8 AM to 5:30 PM everyday
everyday, but I’m so tired I skip classes half the time just to go to more private lessons. Every single day. Seven days a week.
I sleep three hours a night, live off caffeine two cans of Red Bull and monster and a cup of coffee just to keep moving.
I’m dead tired, but I keep going.
A few days ago, I smashed a glass desk at 2 AM out of pure anger while trying to study.

My girlfriend blocked me a month ago for no reason. I say I’ve “moved on,” but I think that’s bullshit.
I quit my hobbies.
I go to the gym alone.
I walk alone.
I eat alone.
I go everywhere alone with my AirPods in just to avoid hearing the silence.


My circle of friends shrunk by like 80%.
Everyone’s living adventures while I’m just stuck here 


I lie to everyone  my parents, my teachers, myself. I keep saying “everything’s under control,” when in reality, nothing is.
I’ve started having auditory hallucinations before sleep.
My parents would kill me if I slowed down or tried to change anything, so I just keep pushing.


I’ve got my final exams this year for university, and honestly, I don’t think I’ll make it if things stay like this.

Just a solo hack and slash dev who has more ideas than time and now I can take a run at getting more of them into the real world. Recently been building out some free educational stuff to support the local school.

 Anyway here's the question. Cursor IDE is pretty great at home but I'm generally on the run and have really been enjoying grabbing a coffee and getting a few features added by using cursors remote workers. I prompt, it works, I get home and see if it made something nice or a mess. But I also have a ChatGPT plan and finding that for some things gpt5 seems better.  I've integrated it into vscode/cursor for home use but I d also like the same remote fire and forget option as cursor. Problem is the git connector in the gpt app refuses to see my private repos. So I've got ChatGPT trying to spot code but it wants me to copy and paste etc and then push that code back at the git later. 

So is there any way to emulate cursors remote workers? Should I be using co pilot? Can I get ChatGPT app to talk to copilot so I can have a conversation about code but then have ChatGPT push it over and get it in repo?

It's a pretty new and exciting world for me but clearly very in flux so any help is appreciated. ",1,1761735078.0,ChatGPTCoding,1,1.0,False

Most looked identical. The ones that went viral? They broke every rule.

Here are the ones that caught my eye and what I think made them work:

**1. Edlog: “We’re building AI for couches.”**

Yes, that’s the real opening line. A guy in an ‘80s suit, smoking a cigarette, talking about AI for couches.

It sounds absurd, and that’s why it worked. Total pattern break. Turns out it’s actually an AI platform for furniture retailers.

*Lesson:* Weird works. If people stop scrolling to figure out whether you’re joking, you’ve already won.



**2. Emergent Labs: “Everyone’s got an idea.”**

Two founders talking over coffee about how everyone wants to build something. Then: *“What if you had an on-demand CTO who actually ships?”*

It’s authentic, founder-led, and perfectly timed for the AI-coding moment.

*Lesson:* Relatability beats production value every time.



**3. ULearn: Just a founder talking to camera**

No fancy effects. No voiceover. Just the founder explaining the product and screen-sharing how it works.

It shouldn’t work, but it feels honest.

*Lesson:* Authentic > perfect. When you’re genuinely excited about what you built, people feel it.



**Bonus: Snowglobe (Guardrails AI): The self-driving car metaphor**

The video opens with: *""This car was tested on millions of scenarios before I could ever ride in it. What if you could test your AI agent on thousands of simulated scenarios before you launch them?""*

It's a talking-head format (founder Shreya on camera), but the hook is a visual metaphor that makes AI agent testing instantly understandable. Self-driving cars → AI agents. Testing simulator → Snow Globe.

The video hit 2M+ views because it made something complex feel familiar.

*Lesson:* When you're explaining technical products, find the metaphor everyone already understands. Self-driving cars are universally known. The bridge between them is what made this stick.



Across all of these, one thing stands out: **execution matters as much as the idea.** The difference between a launch that flops and one that hits 2M views? Usually the team behind the camera.

What's the most unconventional startup launch you've seen that actually worked?",22,1761735040.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1
Four years into her marriage to Adrian Hale, Sienna Lewis finally found a surgical procedure that could completely cure his ALS.

Just as she was about to sign the consent form, the nurse’s eyes flicked between the monitor and Sienna’s face, hesitating for a moment before she spoke.

“Dr. Lewis, the system shows that you and Mr. Hale aren’t legally married. According to hospital policy, only family members can authorize the surgery.”

Certain it was a system error, Sienna decided to find Adrian for his signature—his condition couldn’t wait.

But the moment she stepped into his company, laughter burst from inside the office.

“Damn, Hale, you really played it smart. Four years ago, you staged a fake wedding with Sienna while still in a wheelchair, and now that you’re walking again, you’ve gone and married her beautiful little niece, Isabella. Two women in one family—how lucky can a man get?”

“Haha, pampering the niece by day and loving the aunt by night—tell us, Hale, how’s your stamina still holding up?”

The laughter stopped her dead in her tracks, freezing her blood.

Someone, trying to sound serious, asked, “Hale, be honest—risking everything just to marry Isabella behind Sienna’s back… does that mean you love her more than Sienna ?”

After a brief silence, Adrian’s low voice emerged, his words cutting through the smoke curling from his cigarette.

“At first, when I lost the ability to walk, she drove me insane.”

“That little girl was like a sun that never shut up—always chirping, ‘Uncle, stand up!’ ‘Uncle, look how bright it is outside!’ She drove me mad.”

He chuckled at the memory, then lifted his gaze, his tone growing serious.

“But after a thousand nights of her staying by my side, taking every insult, every outburst, and still smiling through her tears—how could anyone with a heart not be moved?”

“The moment I stood up again, I knew I was done for. I had already fallen for her.”

Boom.


Something burst inside Sienna’s head.

Hot tears spilled down her cheeks, splattering across the surgery consent form clutched tightly in her trembling hands, blurring the ink of her memories.

Sienna and Adrian had grown up together.

Five years ago, he had suddenly been diagnosed with ALS—a once golden boy brought to his knees overnight.

He had spiraled into despair, pushing everyone away and yelling at Sienna to leave him.

But she, a renowned neurosurgeon, never once thought of giving up.

She spent countless nights researching the world’s most advanced studies, flying overseas to consult top specialists.

She was so busy that she barely had time to care for the man wasting away in his hospital bed.

So she hired her most trusted nurse—her niece Isabella—to take care of him around the clock.

When she finally found hope, Sienna personally performed more than a dozen high-risk surgeries.

Her black hair had turned silver at the roots.

Until one day, Adrian felt the faintest tingling in his legs.

He burst into tears, clinging to her. “Sienna, how can I ever thank you? I’d give you my life.”

She cupped his face, smiling gently. “I don’t want your life. Give me a wedding instead.”

She wanted to spend her life caring for him as his wife—never realizing that under Isabella’s care, he had already fallen for her.

Even the grand, heart-warming wedding that moved the world was nothing but a deception.

For two more years she lived in the lie, exhausting herself to restore his health, dyeing her graying hair to hide the toll.

And what did she earn?

His recovery—and another woman taking her place as his legal wife.

She had never stopped fighting to save him. But he had chosen to love someone else.

The laughter continued inside, but Adrian rose and adjusted his tie. “Sienna’s getting off work soon. The forecast says it might rain. I can’t let my wife get wet.”

“Man, Hale, you’re killing us with all that sugar.”

“Don’t forget, you’ve got that billion-dollar deal tonight. The CEO’s waiting for you.”

Adrian smirked, dialing his phone. “Compared to my wife, what’s a few billion? He can wait.”

Through her tears, Sienna saw the man she’d once loved—the same crooked grin that had comforted her when he’d lost a tooth defending her as a child…

The boy who’d shouted her name from the top of a Ferris wheel, under exploding fireworks on her sixteenth birthday.

The one who, after graduation, had dashed out of the exam hall to confess his love on live TV.

The man who’d slipped a diamond ring onto her finger and vowed to love only her for life.

And yet, at twenty-nine, fate made her realize she was nothing but the fool standing outside the door.

The screen of her phone flashed—Husband. She couldn’t bring herself to answer.

Inside, Adrian frowned. “Why isn’t my wife picking up?”

A friend teased, “Come on, Hale. Dr. Lewis is one of the country’s top neurosurgeons—she’s busy. There’s no need to panic over one missed call.”

“How could I not?” His voice rose. “Sienna is my life. Of course I’m worried.”

My life…

Sienna closed her eyes, crushing those two words to shattered pieces in her heart.

Then, with trembling fingers, she typed a reply.

[I’m in surgery tonight. I’ll be working late.]

Relief softened Adrian’s features. He texted back, “Then I’ll wait for you at the hospital.”

Just then, another call came through on his phone.

He accidentally hit the speakerphone button.

A girl’s sweet, syrupy voice filled the room.

“Uncle Adrian, I’ve just taken a shower. Come quickly, I’m waiting for you ~”

His friends erupted with laughter. “Whoa, Hale, that’s not safe for work!”

Adrian snatched his jacket, a grin tugging at his lips. “Get lost, all of you.”

Sienna stumbled backward into the hallway, watching as he walked past her, whistling his way toward the elevator.

She followed quietly, watching him drive away—not toward the hospital, but toward their home.

When Adrian opened the door, Isabella flew into his arms like a delicate butterfly.

He caught her easily, laughing as he lifted her off the ground.

They kissed passionately in the doorway, their bodies pressed together as they moved toward the master bedroom.

Rain began to fall outside. Through the blur of raindrops, his low, playful voice drifted to her ears.

“My little temptress, what am I going to do with you?”

The rain soaked Sienna’s face. Through the window, she watched the entwined silhouettes and finally smiled bitterly.

So much for undying love—devotion could never compete with proximity.

Adrian, the love you wanted was never about life and death, never about souls intertwining.

You only ever wanted what was warm, what was near—someone who stayed by your side.

But you don’t know this yet… your legs will never truly heal.

Still smiling, Sienna crumpled the consent form and tossed it into the trash.

“Adrian, I hope her constant company can heal you completely.”

“And I—will leave you for good.”

Chapter 2
The sounds from the master bedroom finally faded, followed by laughter as Adrian and Isabella stepped out, their voices echoing down the hall.

By the time Sienna returned, the room had already been cleaned spotless by the housekeepers—not a trace of what had happened remained.

She sat motionless in the empty bedroom for a long time, carefully formulating her plan to disappear completely.

She would stage a car accident—let the world believe that: [Sienna Lewis, Wife of the Hale Heir, Had Died in a Tragic Crash, Her Body Never Found].

Every headline would mourn her, and she and Adrian would be severed forever—never to cross paths again in this life.

Just as she was about to leave, the sound of the front door unlocking froze her in place.

Adrian entered with a faint smile still lingering on his lips, but the moment his gaze landed on her, it withered.

Almost instinctively, he stepped back, putting distance between himself and Isabella.

When he noticed Sienna’s damp hair, he hurried forward, pulling her into his arms with familiar tenderness.

“I told you to wait for me at the hospital,” he scolded softly, brushing her hair aside. “Why did you come home on your own? You’re soaked—what if you catch a fever? You’ll worry me to death.”

The warmth of his embrace transported her back to their college days—when she’d fallen ill after getting caught in the rain buying his birthday gift.

He’d held her all night, swearing he’d never let her get drenched again.

For years, he’d kept an umbrella in his briefcase, always showing up after work to walk her home.

Back then, he’d promised to protect her for a lifetime.

But that lifetime had been far too short—short enough for her to watch him fall in love with another woman under the same rain.

Sienna said nothing. When grief cuts too deep, silence becomes the only response.

Isabella, ever the actress, stepped forward with a bright smile, holding a cake box.

“Sienna, look how much Adrian cares for you. He even went out of his way to get your favorite chocolate mousse cake!”

As she lifted the box, a faint trace of perfume wafted through the air—one Sienna recognized instantly.

Her heart clenched. That fragrance… she knew it better than her own name.

It was Sienna’s Grace, the custom perfume Adrian had commissioned years ago—an exclusive scent made by a world-renowned perfumer to mask the antiseptic smell that clung to her after long hours in the operating room.

He’d named it after her, declaring that only she was allowed to wear it.

Now that same scent drifted shamelessly from Isabella’s skin.

Nausea surged. Sienna pushed Adrian away and fled toward the bathroom.

“You two eat. I need to shower.”

She stripped off her clothes with shaking hands, desperate to wash away the clinging perfume, the betrayal, the memories.

The reflection staring back at her in the mirror had red-rimmed eyes—and around her neck hung a delicate necklace that caught the light.

Her fingertips brushed the pendant.

It was the necklace Adrian had made after the car crash years ago, crafted from a fragment of his rib that had been broken while protecting her.

She had once believed that was proof of his love. Even after he was paralyzed, she had never left him.

But now, the sight of it only felt bitterly ironic.

Tears stung her eyes. She tore the necklace off, turned on the shower, and let the scorching water wash away her sorrow.

Wrapped in a towel afterward, she returned to look for her hairdryer—only to find Isabella standing in the bathroom.

When Sienna stepped back inside, Isabella was idly toying with the necklace between her fingers.

“Put that down!” Sienna shouted.

Startled, Isabella flinched—and the necklace slipped from her hand, falling with a sharp plunk straight into the toilet.

She gasped, covering her mouth in feigned panic. “Oh no! I’m so sorry, Sienna—I didn’t mean to! Let me get it for you!”

Before she could move, Adrian rushed in and grabbed Isabella’s wrist.

“Don’t! It’s filthy. Forget it—it’s just a necklace, not worth a thing.”

Not worth anything…

Sienna felt her heart splinter like that small piece of bone sinking into the dirty water—piercing through her soul.

Chapter 3
That night of the car crash, Adrian had shielded her with his entire body, holding her tight as the world fell apart around them.

He’d suffered multiple rib fractures, nearly dying in the wreck.

She had wept uncontrollably by his bedside, but he had only smiled through the pain.

“Sienna, don’t cry. You know, God made Eve from Adam’s rib—the one closest to the heart, the one that symbolizes the purest form of love.”

“Now I’ve had my third rib turned into a necklace for you. It protected you once, and it’ll keep protecting you—always resting against your heart, beating where mine once did.”

Back then, those words had felt sacred.

But tonight, to excuse Isabella’s carelessness, he’d brushed it off as a worthless trinket.

Adrian seemed to realize his words had cut too deep. He hurried over, wrapping an arm around her shoulders with an affectionate smile.

“Alright, don’t be upset. Isabella didn’t mean it. It’s just a necklace. I’ll buy you another one, something bigger, covered in diamonds. Or…”

He pressed her palm against his chest, teasing softly, “Or you could cut me open and take another rib, hmm?”

The lighter his tone, the colder her heart grew, sinking like a stone into a frozen lake.

She could feel the steady drum of his heartbeat beneath her hand.

And in that rhythm, she understood—Adrian’s heart no longer beat for her.

That rib, along with every vow he’d ever made, had been tossed aside into the filth, forgotten and worthless.

It was time to end this—completely.

Sienna turned away, stepped into the bedroom, and locked the door behind her.

Outside, Adrian’s voice called her name again and again, but she never answered.

By the next morning, he was gone.

When she unlocked her phone, the screen flooded instantly with entertainment headlines about him.

[Hale Corporation CEO Spends Millions on Rare Pink Diamond Necklace—A Gift for His Beloved Wife!]

[Public Envy Peaks: Adrian Hale Breaks Another Auction Record to Please His Wife!]

The comments were full of squealing admiration:

[I’m crying, he’s so romantic!]

[[Where do I find a husband like that?]

[Sienna must’ve saved the galaxy in her past life to meet a man like this!]

Her face was expressionless as her cold fingers scrolled through the screen.

Then, amid the praise, a single jarring comment appeared:

[I was at the gala last night—sitting right beside Hale. He wasn’t alone. There was a young woman with him, and he spent the entire night buying her jewelry. That pink diamond? She turned it down, said it didn’t suit her. He only kept it because she didn’t want it. Don’t believe the ‘devoted husband’ act. It’s all for show.]

The words struck like lightning, slicing through her chest.

A second later, the comment vanished—deleted without a trace.

Only the glowing admiration remained, blinding and cruel.

Her breath hitched, each inhale scraping against her ribs.

“Ta-da~”

Adrian’s cheerful voice broke the silence. He appeared behind her, holding out a red velvet box as if conjured from thin air.

“Look, sweetheart,” he said gently, opening it with theatrical care. “A rare pink diamond necklace—bought just for you. My peace offering. Don’t be mad at me, okay?”

He presented it as though it were his heart itself, eyes full of tender devotion.

Sunlight poured through the tall windows, glinting off the necklace. The pink diamond scattered a kaleidoscope of color across the room—radiant, dazzling, impossibly beautiful.

But all Sienna could see was last night’s image—Adrian sitting beside Isabella, bidding millions for jewels to please her.

This wasn’t a token of love.

It was a castoff.

A consolation prize from a man whose love had already been used up.

The last fragile ember in her heart turned to ice—cold, sharp, and permanent.

Chapter 4
Sienna stared blankly at Adrian, making no move to take the velvet box.

“What’s wrong? Don’t you like it?” His lips pressed together, a hint of unease flashing in his eyes.

She simply pushed the box aside and said flatly, “Leave it there. I have to get to the hospital.”

Behind her, Adrian lowered the necklace slowly, his expression dimming as he watched her walk away.


Sienna sat alone at Riverside Café for a long time, her coffee long gone cold. Only after forcing her emotions back into control did she finally call for a ride to St. Augustine Medical Center.

But as soon as she stepped out of the car, she froze.

The hospital entrance was a sea of chaos—reporters, flashing cameras, and screaming onlookers. The air pulsed with excitement as though a movie premiere were unfolding on the sidewalk.

A crowd of A-list celebrities, faces she’d only ever seen on TV, were all gathered there—right in front of the hospital.

At the center of it all stood Adrian, holding an enormous bouquet of Ecuadorian roses, so large it nearly engulfed him. He dropped to one knee before her.

“Sweetheart, please don’t be mad. The necklace thing was my fault. Forgive me, okay?”

As soon as he spoke, the celebrities around him broke into chorus.

“Baby, baby, I love you,

May the angels watch over you,

Wishing you health and beauty too~”

The ridiculous lyrics, paired with their dramatic singing, made the entire scene look absurdly grand and surreal.

Sienna scanned the familiar faces—actors, singers, influencers—all people she had once mentioned casually as her favorites. Adrian had actually brought them all here.

The crowd murmured in awe.

“What a way to apologize! Hiring that many celebrities—this must’ve cost a fortune!”

“Oh my god, that’s my idol! And he’s singing to her! I’m so jealous I could die!”

“Everyone in Astoria knows Adrian Hale is the ultimate romantic! Didn’t he almost die once saving her? That’s real love!”

Standing in the middle of it all, Sienna heard nothing but noise—praise, admiration, envy—all crashing over her like waves.

And in the middle of it stood Adrian, the perfect picture of devotion.

His deep eyes, his grand gestures, his devoted husband persona.

So perfect, so flawless—and so empty.

He’d made her the leading lady of a public fairytale, but the woman in his arms at night was someone else.

He gave her roses and love songs, but the name beside his on the marriage certificate belonged to another.

In the end, she was nothing.

“This is a hospital,” Sienna said coolly, her tone utterly devoid of emotion. “Keep the noise down. I have work to do.”

She turned to leave.

But before she could take a step, a drunken man stumbled out of the crowd, reeking of alcohol.

His eyes were bloodshot, his hand clutching an empty wine bottle.

“Sienna Lewis!” he shouted, his voice hoarse and furious. “You heartless doctor! My mother waited an extra week for surgery because you refused to bump her up the list! She died—and it’s your fault! You should be the one dead!”

Before anyone could react, he hurled the bottle straight at her.

“Watch out, Auntie!”

It was Isabella—throwing herself forward dramatically.

The bottle shattered with a loud crack. Glass shards scattered across the pavement; one jagged piece grazed Isabella’s neck, leaving a thin line of blood.

At the same time, she shoved Sienna hard. Off-balance, Sienna fell backward, landing on her hands.

A sharp sting tore through her palm—when she looked down, a large shard of glass was embedded deep in her flesh, blood spilling rapidly.

“Isabella!”

Adrian didn’t even glance at Sienna. His eyes were locked on the trembling woman in his arms.

He kicked the drunk man aside with a roar, then gently cradled Isabella against his chest, his voice shaking with panic and pain.

“Isabella, you foolish girl! Why would you do that? Your life matters too!”

And in that moment—while her hand bled freely, while pain throbbed through every nerve—Sienna finally understood.

Her life, her devotion, her love... none of it mattered anymore.

Chapter 5
Isabella clutched her neck, eyes brimming with tears as she trembled, feigning just the right amount of pain.

“I... I didn’t even think. I just didn’t want Auntie to get hurt. If she had, Uncle Adrian would’ve been devastated—and I can’t stand seeing him sad…”

Her quivering voice, her selfless act—it was a performance executed with surgical precision, striking Adrian straight in his softest spot.

By the time Sienna managed to stand, Adrian finally glanced at her—but only for a fleeting second.

Then he turned away, anxious and urgent. “Sienna, Isabella’s hurt. I need to get her treated right away.”

He never noticed the blood dripping steadily from Sienna",1,1761734992.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Coz i feel insane.,"It reads long, but I’ve kept it as short as possible including all events that confused and confounded me as brief as possible.

My husband, 11 year old son and I visited our in-laws for Diwali this year. My BIL and his family were there too. 

The day next to Diwali my SIL (BIL’s wife) left for 4 days for Goa with her girl-friends.

I. My BIL has a darling 7 year old daughter. 

Snippets of how their relationship looks:
1. He calls her ‘chaalu’ and ‘shaatir’. Warning us that we shouldn’t fall for her tactics. Shes SEVEN. 
2. He called her sexy when she was 5 because she’s very fair.
3. He has explosive tantrums and suddenly screams at her. 
4. She had just fallen asleep after an hour of story telling with me. After i left her asleep, he entered the room and started screaming at my MIL for an extra pillow. My niece woke up and offered him her own pillow instead, which he took. 
5. Niece is allowed to play online games on mobile phone. A stranger started sending her ‘i love you’ texts on the game. My BIL proudly announced that she has a stalker. 
6. My niece has a gastrointestinal disorder, owing to excessive junk and insufficient nutrition. Her daily morning pre-breakfast was chocos with milk. After doc advised against it , the chocos were replaced with hide and seek chocolate biscuits.

II. One day my husband said we should go for coffee. 6 of us (two kids, MIL, BIL, husband and I) went. BIL ordered two full meals just for himself, while we had coffee and snacks. The bill was 8k. He paid no part of it. Offered no food of his.

III. We needed to visit friends at an undecided venue 5 star venue. Husband said the whole family would go. My BIL started planning what he would order at the undecided 5 star venue. Husband decided just the three of us would go. we took a taxi. BIL didn’t offer his car.

IV. MIL and I had to visit someone. Husband had an errand to run. He suggested everyone go, finish our respective errands and make an evening of it. BIL refused. As he would have to take his car and drive. He doesn’t like anyone else driving his car. 

V. I tried to tempt the rest of the families with a stop for snacks. My MIL jumped at the idea and said we must offer a meal to BIL, then he would definitely come along. Husband and I had a total of 5k left in our accounts after buying them gifts and meals. Mind you, it was us visiting. And had to take a flight and taxi back home.

VI. I made no such offer of a meal and BIL promised he’d look after the kids. He didn’t, my husband ended up taking them out for an ice-cream. He couldn’t run his errand.

I want your opinions. Because i feel like I’m going insane with strong opinions that i bottle up with difficulty.

What I’ve described is just the norm. If i think any of it as out of ordinary, i just end up feeling crazy. ",1,1761734523.0,AskIndianWomen,6,1.0,False
1oj13e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotPepperGrowing/comments/1oj13e2/my_2025_iptv_server_ranking_too_much_coffee/,"My 2025 IPTV Server Ranking: Too Much Coffee, Channel Overload & a Few Eye-Openers","If you’ve ever found yourself up at 1AM, remote in one hand and coffee in the other, wading through endless live channels, you’ll understand why I’m always searching for the **best iptv providers**. I’ve trialed a bunch across the US, UK, CA, and EU—sometimes for work, sometimes just because I can’t resist another documentary. Here’s my honest, slightly caffeinated take on this year’s [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) front-runners.

# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (annual plans bring it down a bit)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, EU, and plenty more)
* **Smoothness:** 9.5/10 (streams stay HD and buffer-free—even during peak US sports hours)
* **Firestick Experience:** Plug-and-play on my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** I originally checked out the **free trial** on a whim, tipped by a Canadian **iptv reseller**. I ended up watching everything from UK breakfast TV to US playoffs in HD. The channel list is massive, but what matters is how stable it is—no mid-match dropouts, and everything works from the couch.

# 2. NovaPrime TV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 36,500+ live, 115,000+ VOD (strong on US/UK, plus a good CA/EU lineup)
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (HD looks great, but I noticed some lag during huge EU football nights)
* **Firestick Experience:** Setup was painless on my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** NovaPrime TV’s **free trial** got me hooked on some obscure UK reality shows (blame too much coffee). The EPG is clear, and switching between CA news and US sports is quick. Only real gripe—occasional buffering during Champions League finals, but for most days it’s super reliable.

# 3. VelocityCast IPTV

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 30,000+ live, 90,000+ VOD (EU/UK focus, but solid US/CA options)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (HD holds up for VOD, but live EU matches can be hit or miss)
* **Firestick Experience:** Installs easily on **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** If you love documentaries and EU sports, this is a good pick. I stumbled into a rabbit hole of German and French channels, and the on-demand selection is impressive. HD is solid except for the rare stutter when everyone’s watching the same live match.

# 4. MapleStream TV

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 21,000+ live, 66,000+ VOD (CA/US focus, with all key UK/EU channels)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for news and daily shows, but not always perfect for big live events)
* **Firestick Experience:** No issues with my **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** MapleStream is my background TV—Canadian news in the morning, US late-night talk shows. The **free trial** was a breeze, and the interface is simple. HD is good for most channels, but if you’re hoping for perfect iptv during the Super Bowl, you might want a backup plan.

# 5. SkylineMedia IPTV

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 19,500+ live, 60,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, some CA/EU extras)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (usually steady, but can freeze on high-traffic nights)
* **Firestick Experience:** Works right out of the box on **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** This service is all about the essentials: US news, UK soaps, and a few CA and EU staples. Not the flashiest, but their **free trial** let me binge a bunch of HD channels before deciding. It’s dependable for everyday viewing, but you’ll notice the difference during big events.

# 6. AtlasVision IPTV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 55,000+ VOD (all the basics from US, UK, CA, EU)
* **Smoothness:** 6.5/10 (fine for casual watching, but major events can lag)
* **Firestick Experience:** Set up is quick on **iptv firestick**
* **Personal Take:** AtlasVision is best for those who just want reliable access to everyday channels. It’s my “background noise” pick—HD is passable, but don’t expect perfect iptv performance during the World Cup. If you’re just looking for the main networks, it’s a budget-friendly option.

# What I’ve Learned After Another Year of IPTV

* **Free trials are a must**—real-world testing tells you more than any feature list.
* Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) providers can stutter when everyone’s watching the same live event, especially in the US or EU.
* No matter the size of the channel list, I always go back to my handful of favorites.
* Using an **iptv firestick** keeps things simple, especially for switching between providers.
* If you’re thinking about becoming an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of tech support calls from friends and family.

Whether you’re tuning in from the US, UK, CA, or EU, finding the [**perfect iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) setup means balancing stability, lineup, and price with your own habits. If you find a hidden gem, let me know—until then, I’ll be here, mug in hand, channel surfing into the night.",1,1761734454.0,HotPepperGrowing,0,1.0,False

The cameras showed them trying to take out a coffee machine, a milk machine, etc.... but these devices turned out to be too heavy for them, so they took our chef's music speaker, leftovers from the cash register and other small items. The worst thing was that they broke a window worth 8k+. The British police turned out to be completely ineffective, as always.

for breakfast today i had this [soup mix](https://imgur.com/EetJcxs) i got from T&T in the summer.  it's dashi broth in these little sachets like teabags only full of seafood flavour.  it. is. delicious.  first time i made it, i opened the sachet and dumped in the mix, but ya, you're not supposed to.  had cabbage in there,[ tofu, more cabbage](https://imgur.com/Km8Opki), cucumber and coffee.

got really hungry later, had this tiny bowl of [cereal](https://imgur.com/0CU1qWH) waiting for my [oatmeal](https://imgur.com/2lheX6p) to cook, eaten with apple, yogurt and coffee.  got hungry again, had [popcorn](https://imgur.com/PWOghwa).  we don't have a microwave and i'm not really sure why.  it's not because of any sort of convictions we have, we just don't have a microwave.  everything is done stovetop or in the air fryer, which looks like a toaster oven.

dinner was a bowl of [cauliflower curry](https://imgur.com/lju05mC) and a homemade 'naan bread' that's just flour and yogurt.  i used a japanese curry and it was a bit too salty the day i made it but kind of mellowed out and was actually pretty good.  i'm probably also going to have a late this morning but that's it.",1,1761734274.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

1oj0zri,https://v.redd.it/hyt6tbvq31yf1,[AMA] Babes with Afterburners - The Omega Plunge,"**Babes With Afterburners - Omega Plunge Edition**

r/Jade\_Industries r/amsw r/ShipandPilot

 Liara: Welcome back, everyone, to Babes With Afterburners, your favorite orbital chaos AMA right here on Reddit! I’m Liara Lance, COO of Jade Industries and reluctant costume consultant.

RBB: And I’m RetroBurnBabe, ARC pilot and the reason Neon’s sanitation crews are still scrubbing glitter fog out of the air vents.

Liara: We’re live from Neon for the Omega Plunge: the record-setting dive into Volii Omega’s famous superstorm, the Eye of Omega. Pilots are prepping, crowds are buzzing, and the Astral Lounge is stringing up more neon cobwebs than should legally exist.

RBB: Halloween in Neon, baby. Equal parts race weekend and nightclub apocalypse. And yes, we’ve got VIP passes to the BorealUS concert. Try not to be jealous.

Liara: We’ll be answering your questions about the Plunge, Halloween in the city, and everything in between.

RBB: Strap in. Or don’t. Your choice. Let’s hit the questions.

RBB: Alright, first one comes from DepthChargeEnthusiast: “What’s the actual goal of the Omega Plunge? Is there a finish line down there, or do you just stop before the hull buckles?”

Liara: The plunge is about depth and pressure. Every meter down is logged against structural integrity and particle yield. The deeper you go, the rarer the atmospheric shifts you capture.

RBB: Translation: we dive until someone screams, “Why is the cockpit making that noise?” Then we log the depth and call it bragging rights.

Liara: SpookyDockWorker asks: “What are your Halloween costumes? Bonus points if they’re flight-rated.”

RBB: I’m going as “everybody’s worst ex”.  Think glowstick earrings, huge hat, fangs, glitter. It’s called fashion, look it up. Neon Witch, baby.

Liara: Subtle.

RBB: Nothing about me is subtle.

Liara: For me?  A nun.  Black habit, cross, glow bracelets.  It’s really a public service because someone needs to pray for Retro’s flight plan.

RBB:  Facts.  And wow!  The Nun of Neon.  I can’t tell if that’s terrifying or strangely on brand.

Liara:  Drinks are on Jade if you can find me at the Astral Lounge.  Consider it communion.

 RBB:  And now I suddenly believe in miracles.

Liara: Okay, EbbsideNightOwl wants to know: “What’s scarier: Neon on Halloween night, or diving into a gas giant?”

RBB: Neon. Absolutely Neon. You can negotiate with crushing atmospheric pressure. You can’t negotiate with three costumed tourists on Aurora trying to adopt you.

Liara: Retro speaks from experience.  Meanwhile, MassEffectCollector asks: “Will there be Omega Plunge pilot trading cards?”

RBB:  Oh stars, if there are, I demand holo-foil treatment.  Maybe a limited run with glitter contrails.

Liara: Only if someone catches you mid-flight before your eyeliner smudges.

RBB:  Rude.  Accurate.  Still collectible.

Liara:  Jade Industries would never approve that run.  But AMSW?  They’ll sell anything with neon on it.

RBB:  Which is why mine will sell out first!

 RBB: Now here’s one from ParticlePirate: “So…what happens to all the exotic stuff you skimmers collect? Rumor is it always winds up in one man’s vault.”

Liara: I’ve been wondering that too. Because I know for a fact it doesn’t end up at Jade Industries.

RBB:  That’s an AMSW thing. They bankroll ARC and we don’t ask too many questions.  The Founder’s probably building a rock garden that glows in the dark. If you hear humming from Hammer Bay, it’s not me testing speakers this time.

Liara: I’d almost prefer it was you.

RBB: Speaking of strange noises, EastCoastWhales asks: “Any truth to the rumor that people hear… weird sounds, deep in the gravity wells?”

Liara: Comms interference. Long-range static under stress conditions. Nothing unusual.

RBB: “Nothing unusual,” sure. Meanwhile half the freighter crowd swears they’ve heard singing in the void. Probably just BorealUS rehearsing in hard vac.

Liara: Convenient transition, because…

Liara: StageDiveCadet wants to know: “BorealUS at the Astral Lounge: are you two really on the VIP guest list?”

RBB: Front row and backstage, baby. If I don’t come out glowing brighter than her lightshow, I did Halloween wrong.

Liara: Jade Industries doesn’t skip culture. And BorealUS is culture. Also, Retro begged.

RBB: I prefer “threatened to drag you.”

Liara:  I’d like to see you try.

RBB:  Yeah, I know.  There’s a reason I don’t go to your gym.

RBB: Moving on, for the rumor-mill crowd, JustCuriousBro asks: “Any truth to mercenary chatter in Volii?”

Liara: Every system has chatter.

RBB: Yeah, I saw one merc last night trying to sell me neon-colored cotton candy on Ebbside. Terrifying.

Liara: That’s not chatter, that’s marketing.  Still terrifying.  Next question.

RBB: Here’s a lighter one, PaparazziPilot says: “Liara, you seem to be a reluctant celebrity. How do you handle the camera drones?”

Liara: I don’t “handle” them. They handle me. Half the time I walk out of a hangar and three holo-mags are already fighting over who gets the cover shot. It’s flattering until you’re just trying to eat noodles in peace.

RBB: Liara’s the only person I know who can swat a camera drone out of her face and still look like she’s signing a luxury deal.

Liara: Perks of running Lancer Luxury. You don’t get to lead Jade’s crown line without learning how to weaponize your angles.

RBB:  She’s not kidding.  She once gave a side-eye so sharp it voided a warranty.

Liara:  Correct.  And I’ll do it again.

RBB:  You know, Liara, that question has me thinking.  Do you *like* being famous?

Liara:  I like influence.  The cameras just come with it.

RBB:  Translation: yes, but only if the angle is right.

Liara:  Wrong angle, and I’ll bill you for damages.

Liara: Now ChromaCaffeine asks: “Retro, how do you keep your energy up during a dive?”

RBB: Terrabrew. Triple shot. Plus whatever PhaseToast calls ‘pre-boost juice.’ Physics runs on caffeine, fight me.

Liara: The ARC team’s nav AIs all have heartbeat monitors specifically synced with their coffee intake lines.

RBB: Food question next, NovaChunks asks: “What’s your Halloween snack of choice?”

Liara: Chunks Pumpkin Spice Edition. They’re already serving it at the Astral Lounge. It’s terrifying.

RBB: I bit into one and saw my ancestors. Delicious though.

Liara: And speaking of questionable drinks, StarfieldFanatic asks: “If Terrabrew made a Halloween special, what would it be?”

RBB: Easy. Terrabrew Witch’s Brew. Cinnamon, spice, and enough caffeine to bring back the dead.

Liara: Jade Industries is already market testing it. Neon swirl effect, cinnamon bite. Debuting at the afterparty.

RBB: Called it!

RBB: Let’s close with this one : VaultSeeker asks: “After the Plunge, what’s next for you two?”

Liara: Personally? I’ve got new prototypes waiting, maybe a few board meetings I’ll pretend to enjoy… and if I’m lucky, somewhere snowy to hit the slopes before the year’s out.

RBB: Slopes? That sounds suspiciously like a teaser.

Liara: Or just me wanting hot cocoa after a month in Neon. Your call.  And no, Retro, you can’t borrow my skis.

RBB: Meanwhile, I’ll still be here: caffeinated, reckless, and probably banned from three more nightclubs.

 Liara: And that’s all we’ve got time for tonight. If we missed your question, blame the glitter.

RBB: Or my caffeine crash. Either way, big thanks to everyone who tuned in, flared up, or just lurked with popcorn.

Liara: The Omega Plunge is about to go live, so expect pressure, particles, and one hell of a post-dive party.

RBB: Fly safe, look reckless.  I’m RetroBurnBabe, an AMSW cautionary tale.

Liara: I’m Liara Lance, Jade Industries. Strong, smart, and still surviving Neon’s Halloween.

This is not another basic list. I’ve tried these. I have the emotional scars and lighter essay-load to prove it. Omg, literally dying rn just thinking about how close I came to missing deadlines…again.

Why am I obsessed with the best essay writing services? Because deadlines are a nightmare. Because professors don’t care if you have 4 assignments due the same day. Because my search history is basically “best essay writing services, help, now.” So, I test them. I panic-order. I pull out my hair. I write dramatic reviews. Here’s my big, messy, honest list.

This site saved ME multiple times. When I have a paper due in, like, 6 hours and have only written the title? Yeah, check it out here: [SpeedyPaper](https://essay.watch/kj5G5K?type=88). Omg, the speed. No random bots. You can actually talk to them. My paper? Not cringe. My feedback came back mostly fine – fixed typos they missed, whatever. It nails what you need:

* Simple ordering (even me – can’t click straight when panicking – figured it out fast)
* Top rated essay writing services, and I get why. Paper was formatted, sources there, no obvious copy-paste. Turnitin? Passed. Cue: shock and happy tears.
* First-timer discount: 11% off.

Use it if you like to have power and options (idk, some people do). Here’s the link to speed things up: [EssayMarket](https://essay.watch/f8xFh8?type=88). You post the job, writers bid. At first, I panicked because I had to chat with writers (not great at being social when my brain is melting). But I picked by rating, and didn’t get scammed. Results?

* You can negotiate price (bless).
* Super good for best research paper writing services, because you preview outlines and sources before hiring. That’s the best custom essay writing services strategy imo.
* UX is clunky but manageable if you’re not deadline delirious like me.

Sometimes you want chill - not chatty, not high-pressure. [WritePaperForMe](https://essay.watch/nzQhPF?type=88) is that kind of site. Quick to order, not many steps. I needed structure and found it:

* Great for outline and early drafts. They offered a draft before the final version (more time to panic or ask for tweaks).
* Good at citations. Didn’t make mine look weird, APA, MLA, whatever.
* Slightly slower response if you’re ordering late at night – fair, people need to sleep. But worth it for the price if you have a day or two.

Best online essay writing services? Depends. But here’s literally what happens in my life:

* Find a last-minute assignment.
* Scream a little.
* Google the best essay writing services reviews.
* Wish for a miracle, actually use one of the above.
* Panic-stalk my email for “order completed”.
* Download paper, hope for the best.

Each site had moments where I wanted to throw my laptop and moments where I swore I’d only ever order with them again. Dramatic? Yes. Real? Also yes.

**Discount Zone (So important):**

* [SpeedyPaper](https://essay.watch/kj5G5K?type=88): 9% off first order.
* [EssayMarket:](https://essay.watch/f8xFh8?type=88) Always has some deal for newbies, but check for extra deals in your account inbox.
* [WritePaperForMe:](https://writepaperfor.me/?rt=9MkKxRbH&sub_id=dmu76j.23.5kd&type=88) 7% off if you remember to enter the code (check their homepage, please don’t forget like I did omg).

Sometimes, a panic order is the only way – and honestly, using the best essay writing services online is survival, not cheating. The time these sites have given me back? Omg, I can’t even. Professors are tough, but these spots make it so you can breathe (or nap).

# Should You Try These Top Rated Essay Writing Services?

1oj0y5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEssays/comments/1oj0y5m/tighten_my_thesis_and_topic_sentences_for_a_1200/,"Tighten my thesis and topic sentences for a 1200 word analysis, quick swaps welcome","Looks like this place is just getting rolling, so I’ll seed the feed with a focused ask. I’m revising a 1200 word analysis on how window views shape point of view in “The Great Gatsby”. My draft reads fine, but the spine is wobbly. Thesis feels padded, and my topic sentences either repeat the claim or dont move it. Deadline in 10 hours, coffee is on.

Current thesis: Windows in Gatsby are not passive backdrops, they train characters to look from a safe distance, and that trained distance turns desire into performance. I like the idea, but verbs feel soft and scope sprawls.

Sample topic sentences I need to sharpen:

1) “Nick’s window gazing sets a model for how we see everyone else.”  

2) “Daisy’s framed views make her seem close, yet she stays staged.”  

3) “Gatsby’s house of lit windows sells longing more than love.”

What I want from you: stronger verbs, less fluff, cleaner logic flow between paras. If you can, rewrite the thesis in one tight line, then propose a parallel set of three topic sentences that step the argument forward. Any grammer flags or rhythm weirdness, mark it. I’ll trade a critique back on your draft, paste a chunk and I’m there.",1,1761733939.0,GetEssays,0,1.0,False

Yeah, same. It’s one of the most frustrating social situations. Whether it’s at work, a party, or online—you want to have that quick, sharp comeback that makes people laugh or shut up.

But here’s the thing: being witty isn’t just something you’re born with. It’s a skill. And like any skill, it can be trained. Most of us were just never taught how. Instead, we picked up bad advice from TikTok influencers who think “just be confident” or “roast them harder” is enough. Nah.

This post is a breakdown of what actually works, based on real research, books on communication, improv training, and even psychology podcasts. It’s not magic, and it’s not genetic. It’s learnable. So if you’ve ever wished you were faster on your feet with comebacks, here’s your cheat sheet.

Pulled from experts like Daniel Kahneman, behavioral psychologists, improv trainers, and linguists. Backed by research, not vibes.

Let’s get into it.

- **Slow = silent. Train speed first, polish later.**  
  According to Daniel Kahneman’s *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, our brains have two systems: fast (impulsive, intuitive) and slow (analytical, deliberate). Witty people operate from the fast system. They don’t wait for the “perfect” response—they just say something that’s 80% good, and that’s enough. Practice speed by doing timed word association games or improv prompts. The key is to *respond*, not *hesitate*.

- **Read more comedy than you watch.**  
  Writers are the real wits. Watching sitcoms or stand-up is fun, but reading scripted comedy (like *The Office* scripts, McSweeney’s, or Twitter threads from comedy writers) helps you absorb structure. You start to see how setups and punchlines are formed in words. This builds pattern recognition—essential for comebacks.

- **Practice ""echo + twist"" comebacks.**  
  This one’s straight from UCB improv training. It’s when you repeat part of what the other person said, then twist it. Example:  
  Them: “You always show up late.”  
  You: “And yet, I still beat your weak argument here.”  
  It’s simple: echo their words, add a left turn. It buys time and sounds clever without being aggressive.

- **Use the ‘Benign Violation’ rule.**  
  From behavioral scientist Peter McGraw’s research on humor: all good jokes come from a “benign violation.” You break a norm, but not in a threatening way. This is why a sarcastic jab works better than a full-blown insult. Great comebacks live in this tension. You want it to be slightly rude, but still playful. Think: roast, not war.

- **Build a mental library of go-to formats.**  
  Witty people don’t reinvent the wheel. They have templates. Some examples:  
  “Did it hurt… when [insert ridiculous scenario]?”  
  “You talk a lot for someone with so little to say.”  
  “That’s a cute opinion. Wrong, but cute.”  
  These aren’t copy-paste lines. They’re blueprints. Customize and stack them.

- **Steal from improv: the ""yes, and"" technique.**  
  Improv comedy teaches that denying makes a scene die. So if you’re caught off guard, don’t go defensive. Agree, then flip.  
  Them: “You’re such a nerd.”  
  You: “Yeah, and it’s terrifying how much cooler I still am than you.”  
  “Yes, and” keeps the energy light while still letting you win.

- **Sharpen your observational humor.**  
  Good comebacks aren’t just wordplay, they’re quick observations. Train your mind to notice weird details. Watch people like Conan O’Brien or Hasan Minhaj—both are masters of noticing tiny absurdities and flipping them into jokes. The more specific your jab, the better it lands.

- **Use silence as a weapon.**  
  Sometimes, the best comeback is a well-timed pause. Research from the *Harvard Negotiation Project* shows silence creates pressure. If someone tries to insult you and you just *look* at them, smirking, they often fold. Then you can casually say, “Anyway…” and change the topic. Power move.

- **Don’t over-roast. Aim for playful dominance.**  
  According to a study in *Evolutionary Psychology*, humor evolved as a way to signal intelligence and status without violence. Witty comebacks should *elevate* you, not destroy the other person. A good rule: if everyone laughs *except* the target, it was too much. Read the room.

- **Get feedback. Yes, really.**  
  Record yourself doing improv practice or even just joking with friends. Watch it back. What landed? What flopped? Even pro comedians do this. Feedback is how you calibrate timing and tone. Without it, you’re just guessing.

- **Read “Humor, Seriously.”**  
  This book by Stanford professors Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas breaks down the psychology of humor at work and in life. They explain how humor strengthens influence, trust, and creativity. It’s not a joke book—it’s a toolkit for everyday wit. Game changer.

- **Stop aiming to be funny. Aim to be *clever*.**  
  Witty isn't the class clown. It’s not loud or try-hard. A study from the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* found that people who used dry humor and irony were rated as more intelligent and attractive than people who used aggressive or sexual humor. Wit is subtle. It’s a nod, not a shout.

- **Default to self-deprecating when unsure.**  
  If you’re in doubt, make yourself the target. Example:  
  Them: “You spilled your drink again?”  
  You: “Yeah, I’m basically carrying on the legacy of clumsy ancestors.”  
  Self-roast keeps things light and disarms tension. Plus, it shows emotional intelligence.

- **Practice “micro-roasts” daily.**  
  Start small. Roast your coffee. Roast your commute. Roast your friend’s phone case. Do it in your head even if you don’t say it out loud. You’re building the muscle. Think of it like mental pushups.

- **Wits aren't born, they're built.**  
  A study from the *British Journal of Psychology* found that verbal intelligence—not general intelligence—is the strongest predictor of humor ability. That means it’s more about training your brain with words and patterns than being “naturally funny.” Word games, pun practice, clever tweets—it all counts.

Most people think witty people are just “born that way.” Nah. They’re just people who practiced noticing, responding fast, and keeping things clever instead of cruel.

It’s a skill. And you can get scary good at it.

About the roommate: She/her pronouns, queer/pan, mid-40’s, work as professional companion for seniors and novelist. I’m totally cool with you entertaining friends/hosting overnight guests whenever but I prefer someone who won’t have the tv on in the common area very often when I’m home.

1oj0v59,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1oj0v59/wegoby_gases_horrible/,WEGOBY gases - horrible,"Hello

I have been taking WEGOBY for just 7 weeks, currently with a dose of 0.75, since the doctor, seeing that I was doing so well, did not want to raise me to 1, but rather go little by little.
I have lost exactly 10 kilos. I have 30 left :-(
The fact is, my first 4 punctures were 0.25, then 0.5, and last week it was 0.75. To date, super good as far as side effects are concerned, 
But on Sunday I had a birthday and I overdid it, I didn't overeat but I did eat things that I don't usually eat (sugar and fats).
Well, at 6 in the afternoon I started with some of the most unpleasant belching, totally smelly, and they were continuous, I couldn't eat dinner, I couldn't even have breakfast on Monday, only a coffee, which gave me unbearable stomach pain, at first I was scared, because they were in the upper part and centered, but then it moved from the side, the side, down... I spoke to the doctor and he told me that it was gas for 2 reasons, those initial belching and the pain not static but changing (the gases that move).
Well, on Monday I couldn't even eat and on Tuesday very little... and today, Wednesday, I woke up perfectly.
Lesson learned, no more sugar or fats, because I have really had a hard time. My question is, what do you take for gas? Do they hit you that hard? Something similar had happened to me in my life.
