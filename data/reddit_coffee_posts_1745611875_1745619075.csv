Unfortunately the machine cannot power on after following initial setup. I bought this machine from seattle coffee gear and am in the process of a return. I wanted to know if anyone else ran into this issue and if it is typical to get reimbursed partially for an instance like this. The repackaging itself will take a good deal of time let alone bringing it to a fedex. I am sticking with this machine, but want to know if I can expect the replacement to function properly - or if I should look at a different coffee wholesaler. From what I can see online this issue is not an anomaly. Do other similar tier espresso machines experience this issue?",1,1745618992.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

(to the tune of “Taxi” by Harry Chapin)

⸻

It was late one night when the streets turned gray,
I drove my yellow cab through a wasteland way,
And the neon rain made the gutters shine,
And the junkies danced in a dirty line.
I was Travis then, with a crooked grin,
And the city howled like a ghost within.

I picked her up at a campaign hall,
She was beautiful, proud, and ten feet tall,
She said “Pal, just drive and don’t ask why,”
And I said “Miss, you’re a bright spot in a rotten sky.”
I tried to talk, but she looked away,
Her smile was a mask that began to fray.

And I drive… and I drive… through the steam and the sin,
With the blood in my heart and the rage on my skin,
And I dream… oh I dream… that the filth’ll be clean,
And the scum washed away by a fire unseen.

Took her to coffee, tried to make it right,
But I showed her the filth that crawls at night,
She ran from me, disgusted, gone,
And I knew, in my gut, that the war was on.
A man alone with no one to save,
Wears his madness proud like a martyr’s grave.

So I drive… and I drive… down the barrels of hell,
Buying guns, buying death, buying dreams I can’t sell,
And I pray… oh I pray… for a signal, a call,
For some damn good reason to shoot it all.

(Bridge — soft and broken)

And the child with the haunted eyes,
Sells pieces of her soul to the crawling flies,
Twelve years old and the world’s betrayed,
So I sharpen my soul like a razor blade.

⸻

I tracked them down through the piss-stained bars,
Past the broken men with their busted cars,
I bought my war with a blood-red storm,
And I carved my name in the shape of a gunman’s form.
She wept through the flashing blue,
And the headlines screamed: “A Hero’s Due.”

But I drive… and I drive… through the silence and smoke,
Through the cheers of the crowd and the mirrors that broke,
And I laugh… yeah, I laugh… but it’s cracked and it’s thin,
’Cause the war I was fighting is under my skin.

(Outro — whisper-fading)

It’s a taxi world, and the meter’s cracked,
And you can’t go home…
when the road’s gone 
all blackish 
and black…

1k7x8wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1k7x8wz/the_primordial_sun/,The Primordial Sun,"              I snapped back to focus with a jolt. A mile before my exit, heading eastbound in the haze of a dusk colored skyline just after rain, there was a tragedy of a minor caliber. I do not mean to presume the collateral damage and dramatics of a fireball careening into a waiting building below to be minor. Yet, the most peculiar revelation was exhumed by the jaws of life used by the first responders. I would hear of it that evening in my apartment on the local news: there were no fatalities. My eyebrows furrowed, openly pensive.
           
         I recall following the man, even seeing the facsimile of a driver silhouetted behind a near opaque window as we both accelerated from a freshly green light. I’d seen him before, in fact. Several times over the past year since my move to New York. I have a habit of fulfilling dull lapses of time spent trekking the same stretch of winding road and familiar trees during my latter commute. In doing so, I record non-specifics of things and people; colors and shapes of cars, words on license plates, bumper stickers and all other manner of disinterest. 

          The profile for this gentleman formed accidentally one evening several months ago when these non-specifics overlapped and I formed a new connection— one sided as it may have been. Yes, he was an astute driver. . . one occupying the stickler mentality for the roadway. Even going so far as to cordially stop for a family of wild turkey to cross the road. I presumed myself an unwilling passenger occupying his rear view mirror for that affair. I recall that being the most pleasant, mind-numbing five minutes to pass by. Irregardless, I reckon he and I are of a kind; night owls whose jobs permit us but few hours of daylight. 

           I suppose in hindsight, it is with this sincere recollection that I find that pensiveness to be justified. We may have never exchanged so much as a word, but I felt a queer kinship to this stranger. Stranger, of course being the operant word given the minor tragedy to unfurl but fifty feet or so before me on interstate 87. The rescuers were as perplexed as anyone could be. Multiple accounts placed this man, who I now know as Benjamin Hastur, in his vehicle, returning from a shift at the chemical plant five minutes across from my own workplace. One minute, there is an attentive, by-the-books driver, the next, his 1977 Ford Pinto awoke every lazy-minded vehicle operator within a half mile radius. 

          I recall that horrific crunch resounding defiantly against an otherwise quiet moment of irreverence. I could see it but four car lengths gained upon me as it ground heavy against the retaining wall. I regaled in its’ producing a magnificent spray of sparks before flipping over that wall and landing with a memorable thwack upon the roof of some poor, forgettable government building of irrelevant repute. And I can recall feeling a bitter, heavy and cold weight of watching a man seemingly take his own life. 

          So to return home that odd evening, ignoring the pilings of mail held securely in my apartment’s mailbox, hearing of no death or other horrific from that peculiar event was bizarre. The following week, one eve upon the conclusion of my more remorseful drive home from work, I decided it long overdue to clean out the mail now bulging from within its thin bronze coffin. With yellowing and white envelops of various sizes forming minute mountains upon my parlor table, I set to the bric-a-brac nonsense held within their tongue-sealed bodies. One particularly ornate letter made its esteem plain to me that dreaded, infamous Friday night. 

          **Addressed to John T. Boyer,** the letter opened in fine cursive far above the quality of letter accustomed to my plain eyes. It continued in fanciful detail to the peculiarities of the night one week prior in which Mister Hastur ceased. Yet, the oddest oddity to grace my evening was the invitation that followed. 


         **On behalf of the Hastur estate, we invite you to attend the celebration of Benjamin and the procession of laying our son to rest. 
          Best regards, Alexander & Annalise Hastur**


         I have no idea what mysticism therein catalyzed my impetus to action, yet I felt strangely compelled to attend. In hindsight, I should have burned that baleful letter addressed to me. I should have resigned my position of work and enterprised a relocation somewhere more agreeable, somewhere that Alexander and Annalise Hastur would have never thought to reach. Yet, on the afternoon of the posted celebration, with the address in hand and mind, I found myself gleefully awaiting the press upon my suit to complete at the cleaners down the road. To what creature above I have to owe the unearned optimism toward a funeral, I know not. There were many peculiarities set forth with Benjamin’s labeled death. 

          Perhaps I should have considered why I had been elected to receive a summons to the estate. I had never exchanged so much as a glance with Benjamin. As my vehicle crept up the long drive flanked by a detachment of well-to-do shrubberies and omnipresent streetlights, I took in the scale of the place. I had to stop at an auspicious checkpoint populated by a stern-faced man in policing armor, equipped with a baton and pistol, who asked for my identification. He compared it to a clipboard I did not have the good graces of reading, then nodded and bid me to proceed up the drive. My truck was small compared to the boats of Cadillacs and Bentleys that formed the armada of financial superiority I found myself surrounded by. The K5 Blazer I parked was mockish in its rusted, well-worn presentation, and I suddenly had all of the confidence of a grade school boy in a room full of elites. 

          Nevertheless, I approached the three-storied manse and its cobblestone, oak wood frontage where a greeter bade me a polite bow and industry-standard smile. I did not belong here, I had thought to myself. I didn’t even know what Benjamin looked like. For all I knew, this had been some ruse to lay low my already lowly life, to remind me of my station. I felt then a defensiveness to justify my entire life, and with it a tinge of bile creeping into my parched throat. It took a gentle reminder that I did in fact feel some form of kinship with Benjamin, though I never did get to meet the man of the hour. 

           Inside, I was dazzled by the masterfully placed marble inlays, the darks of complementary teak wood walls and beautifully reflective floors presenting a foggy assumption of myself just below my feet. There was an atmosphere rife with loss and pride. Something else I couldn’t quite place at the time, something I’d almost call ‘sinister’ festooned itself like an aura in the air. There were many who personified affluence talking quietly amongst themselves, paying me no mind until the procession into the theater where beautiful bouquets of dazzlingly colorful flowers snaked their way across signage depicting Benjamin and his date of birth and death. 

          “Did you know him well?” A man leaned over quietly to ask me. He wore a cherry red dress shirt and simple gray-black slacks. He regarded me with an earnest curiosity and unfortunately one-sided tinge of grief. I must have bore a look of puzzlement at his ambush as he added, “Benjamin, I mean.”

          “Ah,” I replied, veiling my nervousness best I could, “about as well as two working men could know one another.” I laughed, hoping my sentimentality was enough to sate the man’s curiosity. He offered me a flat, sympathetic smile and curt nod, apparently satisfied with my reply. 

            Taking my seat, I would be visited by one more interruption before the proceedings. A woman, quite beautifully dressed in a cream white dress bearing a glittery material and quite the auspicious train behind it leaned over my shoulder. Though, I found it odd that one should wear such attire to a funeral. I could smell her fragrance of elderberry flowers, and when she spoke I found myself transfixed upon her angelic features and sanguine red lips.

           “Mister Boyer, I presume?” Her words were as heady as her aroma, and I found myself suddenly, cursedly distracted by her beauty. 

            “Ah, yes, and of whom do I have the pleasure?” I replied as calmly as I could, given the carnalities being a man seems to bring with it. 

             “Ms. Annalise Violette Hastur, the pleasure is all mine darling,” she replied, extending the back of her hand to my direction. It took me just the right amount of time to awkwardly realize she implied me to kiss her hand. Her eyes, a beautiful emerald shade, remained locked upon mine— that crease of smile setting her face so heavenly never departing. I flushed, kissing her hand, though I admit it was in part of her beauty, but also confusion compounding that burned my cheeks scarlet so. “Benjamin would have been so glad you made it,” she said, before taking her place alongside the burly slab of man I could only assume was her husband and Benjamin’s father. I fought the urge to slack my jaw, completely befuddled as to her closing statement. There was an expectancy to that, one which set my spine on ice. 

             The funeral was standard expectation, where family members cried garish, ugly tears and spoke highly of the man we gathered here to mourn. Only, on more than one occasion did I notice an errant set of eyes upon me from members of the crowd, something which set my forehead to a light sweat. I found there, so suddenly that I needed to leave. A fish out of water I was, I looked for the opportunity to exit. And while the father spoke of Benjamin’s schooling years, I noticed a man come back from the water closet and decided therein would lie my opportunity. I politely made my frame small, and indicative that I was in need of relief, made my way out into the entryway where the bathroom lie down some doors. 

           Only, as I exited the assemblage, I ran into Ms Annalise, feeling her buoyant bosom cushion our collision. All thoughts of exodus were alarmingly drowned out by her scent. Her eyes fell upon mine— though I was some inches taller than her and years younger than her— like a snake upon a mouse. “Are you leaving already, John?”

          I swallowed the saliva present within my throat, searching in vain for the answer that I had not the time to conceive. 

          “Of course, the loss of a dear friend affects each of us differently. I suppose perhaps this is too… sudden,” she said, placing a hand in mine. I felt something of weight within her palm. “I understand of course. But please, take this,” Ms Annalise said, emptying a locket into my open palm and sensually closing it with her hand. “Our guests are each receiving one, in honor of Ben.” I felt it then and should have rejected— that fear, primordial and deep as the Marianas. Yet like a woodland animal stumbling through the forest floor, I found myself imperceptibly clasped in her trap. “Thank you for coming, John. It means the world to us.” That was the last time I saw Ms Annalise. 

            I spent the weekend keeping that token as far from mind as possible. That very evening, when I found myself upon my apartment stoop, I tossed the damnable clasped thing upon my parlor table and fought the sudden urge to drink the remaining evening away. Yet in the small moments between thoughts and drink, I found myself nagged impossibly persistently by thoughts of the Hastur family. Of Benjamin and our… relationship? I had soured many friendships and relationships. My regressiveness in social commonplace may have aided in that desire to drink the weekend into stupor. Since the death of Maryanne, my wife only two months after we had wed, I have failed to keep those close to me aware of the fact that they were. If I were so obtuse at maintaining my relationships, why then did I receive summons to those damn affluent assholes? Who was I to them? 

           It was Monday morning, while recovering with a bitter coffee, that I groped suddenly for that pendant and tossed it curiously in my hand. It was a faded brass color, with spots of black and orange pockmarking its exterior. The necklacing rasped in metal whispers as I considered the thing. I heard my television animate with a start, startling me. Taking my eyes off of it, I dropped the thing and shut the TV off. Standing straight up from the television I became acutely aware of a temperature shift. It was July, and even on the most forgiving of days, the mornings were ruddy and hot. Yet my apartment possessed a bespoke chill to it all of a sudden. 

            When I turned back to my mug of coffee, I yelped at the figure half present in my bathroom doorway across from the kitchenette. I blinked in haphazard surprise and when I again eyed the spot, I saw only the white tiling of my bathroom wall. Had I imagined the shadowy, lithe thing? I assured myself my bender had something to do with the oddities of this Monday morning before returning, albeit shaken, to my morning routine. That was when I remembered the pendant now splayed open across my kitchen floor. I had expected a warm, grainy image of Benjamin smiling with some well-to-do phrase of remembrance from the family. I had expected a normal pendant, but then again, I shouldn’t have expected anything normal from those abnormal events the Friday prior. 

             In its open form, I saw instead an intricately crafted orrery with an impossibly black planet of stormy oceans at its core. It was orbited by two moons and a sea of stars not native to any astrological maps I had seen. Upon the storming planet, I saw a lighthouse caricature depicting an open flame of purple atop its spire. The spray of salt water was as black as the void of space around it. I couldn’t for the life of me determine the material used in creating the macabre piece, nor why it looked so lifelike. The moons condemned the planet of their orbit, I felt like, to an eternity of nothing. Though why I felt this way, I could not dictate. 

              I felt at once as if I had sinned and with a shudder, I closed the pendant. I didn’t notice it then, but there was a puddle underneath the pendant. A salty brine of unknowable origin and unforgettable consequence. For the remainder of the week, I thought nothing of the pendant, except to have it appraised by several jewelers. The first four of them simply waved the thing off as some paltry toy and laughed me out the door. But That evening, when I presented the thing to Madame Wyn at the Parlor of Incandescence, I felt as though I had finally made a breakthrough in gauging its value. Part of me felt horrible at considering throwing the thing away, but I received it from a family I knew nothing of, and it had done nothing but plague me with nightmares. 

            When the crone inquired about my receipt of the trinket, I told her it was a family heirloom. When she opened it, I believe that is when I understood the gravity of my mistake and misfortune. The old woman screamed as the pendant opened, revealing that impossibly lifelike planet of unknown consequence. Slack-jawed, I observed that its makeup had shifted, as if the oceans had continued their pounding of the Hythean Cliffs while it remained closed. Hythean Cliffs. Why had I thought of that name so nonchalantly? With a snap, Madame Wyn closed the bauble and bid me good evening, stammering apologies. She sounded sorrowful, I remarked as I stood outside the now-dark shop. She had said something about the primordial sun’s advance. There were no suns observing the planet, only moons, I thought. 

             As I drove home that night, I felt a sudden unease take root within my psyche. The colors of the familiar streets I haunted on my way home adopted a more pallid shade to them, and it wasn’t until I was but a minute from my apartment that I noticed how much darker the shadows were. I felt my eyelids grow heavy, and when I focused once more, I nearly screamed. Above, a massive sun shone with a charcoal, ruddy black body, licking with intensely yellowed coronal flares at a hollow sky. It occupied nearly all of the skyline above the city, casting pale yellow, malevolent light upon the buildings. I could hear the intensely whipping, cackling flames of the massive leviathan body, its lugubrious surface smoldering with a magmatic fury incomprehensible to my feeble mind. 

           I held a hand up, shielding myself from its terrifying magnificence, only to hear the drone of a car horn. I looked once more upon my windshield as that bright light was no more than an opposing pair of headlights. I had strayed into oncoming traffic and passed my apartment. I swerved sharply into my lane once more and skidded my K5 Blazer to a sharp halt. There was no sun above us, only the familiar star speckled night sky. Taking a moment to right my staggered, heaving breaths, I white-knuckled upon the steering wheel once more. Only, when I looked upon the road before me again, I saw that shadowy figure standing on a sidewalk under the streetlight across from me. 

          Disregarding the creature as the product of my tired and overwhelmed mind, I drove, unsteadily home for an evening and hopefully weekend of rest. It stared at me unblinking as I drove past. Nevertheless, I made it back to my apartment. I abstained from the bottle, for it had taken me two days the previous week’s start to recover my vitality from the binge. I opted instead to watch a serial on tv. For several hours, I dissociated from the week’s hardships and peculiarities, enjoying comedies, dramas and some news. I stiffened in my chair at the banner of the news story. 

          **Third unmanned vehicular accident this month has authorities puzzled.** I stared dumbly at the screen, thinking then of Benjamin and Annalise Hastur. There had been more accidents, true. But for all of them to result in no fatalities? I thought then of the funeral. If Benjamin had not died, where then, was he? Eyeing the pendant, I noticed the salty brine underneath it. I opted to turn off my air conditioner then, feeling suddenly chilly in the early August heat. Reaching for the air conditioner remote control, I froze in my chair when I remembered my air conditioning unit was broken. So what did I feel blowing down my neck?

           I snapped around with a frightful yelp, only to be greeted with my empty parlor space. Yet I still felt as though eyes were upon my nape. With a shock, I realized it was eleven o’clock and opted for my bed. Boyishly, I also decided it best to sleep with the lights on that evening— a habit I had kicked as a young highschooler. That night, I dreamt of the primordial sun. I saw glimpses, razed in inferno underneath an alien sky, I felt the blister of my skin sundered by an incandescence unrivaled by our own familiar sun. It’s astounding magnitude flooded the skies above. Those tentacular whips of fire scoured away the seas, the earth, the buildings we foolishly erected— it annihilated everything. 

          Plumes of black smoke flooded the skies, doing little to abate the advance of the all-consuming sun. The air resonated with the deflating screams of men and women burning and roiling like ants under a magnifying glass. The very shadow at my feet slinked away, its presence consumed by the raging god above. The air I breathed in desperate gulps grew hot and uncomfortable, and my lips cracked and bled, parched for eternity under the scrutiny of the primordial sun. As the earth split with crags and bubbled with the cauldrons of burbling magma underfoot, I ran. 

          I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, heaving chest fulls of burning, acrid air as I did. I foolishly raced against the god scouring the globe at my feet. My back split and groaned, the skin bubbling and fracturing. I felt my blood evaporating as I screamed and fell, prostrating, to my knees. The marrow in my bones dried and I was conscious for every second of my illuminating oblivion. This, I decried, must be penance for man’s folly. For what, I am unsure. In my final act, as my lungs ballooned and exploded, I lay upon the charcoal earth, staring at the primordial sun as it bathed my understanding in a damning flame of death and fury. I wept tears of smoke and ash, as my eyes finally dissolved. And I awoke. I awoke and remembered M’nomnoc.

         Throughout the next day, I saw glimpses of figures within my apartment. Tall and lithe, with bodies comprised entirely of shadow, they stood still. There were only ever one to three of them, watching me, always nearby that pendant. Whenever I looked upon it, I thought of that horrid sun. It came to me more frequently. At first, I saw the burning thing in dream, then, I would see it while watching the television. Finally, between the flits of my blinking eyes, I would see that horrifying, magnificent thing bearing down upon me. More and more that weekend, I would see those figures. Their chilling presence felt almost welcome when compared to the all encompassing inferno of M’nomnoc. I tested that word Sunday evening, my eyes bloodshot from the hour I’d kept them open. Where did it apparate? Is that what I would come to know the primordial sun as?

          Monday morning, awaking from the reality of burning in eternal anguish, having felt every liquid within my body evaporate, as I lay there a shriveled carcass, I screamed against the raging inferno. Then I thought of the pendant. I thought of Madame Wyn and her declaration. Between the Empyrean heat death of my eye blinks, I stupidly and shakily opened the pendant. There were five of them now. Five figures watching me with silhouetted anticipation. I could feel it constantly now, the heat bearing down upon my back. Though, in my waking hours, it was far more bearable than the burning suffering of my time between open eyes. Within the cool, black shell, I stared upon the Hythean Cliffs, watching mystified as the sepulchral waters churn away at the bone-white cliffs that strange ineffable tower sits upon. 

          It is dark, and the two moons offer neither solace nor love. There are thousands of monuments erected upon the surface of that impossibly black, oceanic planet. My eyes lull upon the intricately carved dunes of some unnamed wasteland coinciding with the dead grass of a pallid plains overlooking the cliffs. I feel some shard of my soul bound upon this dark, ever vigilant planet. Its seas are defiant of M’nomnoc, their vast depths containing layers upon layers of the cosmos of a forlorn space. 

         I curse to myself, realizing with a start I am late for my shift. I bury away the pain of M’nomnoc as well as I hide the bags dropping underneath my bloodshot eyes. I would cry, but my tears appear to have dried up since being assailed by the ever-present primordial sun. The shadows are all around me now. There is a sixth I welcome with neither contempt nor open arms. They have a praxis of distance, of which the parameters appear to have been slowly closing this past weekend. We stare upon the cliffs of the Gnothic sea, our eyes following the nooks of the Hythean Cliffs, swept in long dead vines. 

        I close the pendant and find the will to get into my vehicle. The truck turns over easily, and I solidify my plans to seek out Madame Wyn after work today. She spoke of the primordial sun, and she will have the answers I seek. I think I see it, it’s hazy effervescence breaking the atmosphere above. I pull onto the westbound 87, screaming as the sun descends slowly. I know what is coming. And I know then, why Benjamin and the others consigned themselves. It is too late to find somewhere to stop. Too painful to do anything other than surrender. I feel the latch upon the shell of the pendant pop and grope desperately upon the orrery. My breath wheezes and shudders and I—

         My feet crunch upon the surf-lapped sand, and I am small. I look upon the bone-white, jutting rises of the cliffs above me, and I hear the break of the sepulchral sea blacker than the night sky behind me. I stare up at the drapery that is the vines swathing the Hythean Cliffs. I feel the looming presence of anticipation somewhere beyond me and sense I am not the first, nor the last. I can smell the petrichor and see the evacuating miles-tall anvil black thunderheads no longer obfuscating the cosmically unknown expanse of a hazy purple starscape above. 

          I taste the salt upon my lips, grateful they do not parch and crack and bleed. I see Benjamin, having nearly breached the summit of the Hythean Cliffs. I see Annalise, in her splendor, beckoning me forth from a vantage some distance high, set upon a rocky outcropping upon the bone white cliffs. And I sense, some distance above, the umbral flame licking energetically at the gray fog enshrouding the coastline. I take one step, and then another, sure suddenly that should I stop, it will be my undoing. From this distance, I feel the heartbeat of the tower I cannot see but can understand. Its thin rise, flanked by infinitely reflective bulwarks of obsidian, contains something I should see. Something I want to show Benjamin and Annalise. 


         With whimsy, I understand what is buried underneath the Unnamed tower.

(to the tune of “Taxi” by Harry Chapin)

⸻

It was late one night when the streets turned gray,
I drove my yellow cab through a wasteland way,
And the neon rain made the gutters shine,
And the junkies danced in a dirty line.
I was Travis then, with a crooked grin,
And the city howled like a ghost within.

I picked her up at a campaign hall,
She was beautiful, proud, and ten feet tall,
She said “Pal, just drive and don’t ask why,”
And I said “Miss, you’re a bright spot in a rotten sky.”
I tried to talk, but she looked away,
Her smile was a mask that began to fray.

And I drive… and I drive… through the steam and the sin,
With the blood in my heart and the rage on my skin,
And I dream… oh I dream… that the filth’ll be clean,
And the scum washed away by a fire unseen.

Took her to coffee, tried to make it right,
But I showed her the filth that crawls at night,
She ran from me, disgusted, gone,
And I knew, in my gut, that the war was on.
A man alone with no one to save,
Wears his madness proud like a martyr’s grave.

So I drive… and I drive… down the barrels of hell,
Buying guns, buying death, buying dreams I can’t sell,
And I pray… oh I pray… for a signal, a call,
For some damn good reason to shoot it all.

(Bridge — soft and broken)

And the child with the haunted eyes,
Sells pieces of her soul to the crawling flies,
Twelve years old and the world’s betrayed,
So I sharpen my soul like a razor blade.

⸻

I tracked them down through the piss-stained bars,
Past the broken men with their busted cars,
I bought my war with a blood-red storm,
And I carved my name in the shape of a gunman’s form.
She wept through the flashing blue,
And the headlines screamed: “A Hero’s Due.”

But I drive… and I drive… through the silence and smoke,
Through the cheers of the crowd and the mirrors that broke,
And I laugh… yeah, I laugh… but it’s cracked and it’s thin,
’Cause the war I was fighting is under my skin.

(Outro — whisper-fading)

It’s a taxi world, and the meter’s cracked,
And you can’t go home…
when the road’s gone 
all blackish 
and black…

1k7x5tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k7x5tj/does_whirlpool_wharos5_reverse_osmosis_water/,Does Whirlpool WHAROS5 Reverse Osmosis Water Filtration System Truly Deliver? Read This Review!,"Testing the Whirlpool WHAROS5 Reverse Osmosis System has been quite an interesting journey. As someone who prioritizes safe and high-quality water for all activities at home, I was particularly intrigued to see how this product stacks up against other reverse osmosis water filtration systems. This sleek and compact unit, measuring 14 inches deep, 13 inches wide, and 15 inches tall, hasn’t just blended into the corner of my kitchen but has genuinely impacted how I view my drinking water.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The design is one of the first things to catch your eye. Featuring a modern chrome faucet, it feels both functional and visually appealing. I’ve got a minimalist kitchen, and adding this faucet didn’t detract from the aesthetic—it actually enhanced it. The clean lines and polished finish give the water source a truly contemporary vibe. Plus, the under-sink installation kept everything out of sight, leaving my countertops clutter-free. For people like me who enjoy a neat and modern kitchen environment, this setup scores high marks.

**Ease of Installation**  
As someone who struggles with DIY, the Whirlpool WHAROS5 pleasantly surprised me. The inclusion of color-coded tubing and push-in connectors genuinely simplified the setup process. While I usually dread installation manuals, the provided instructions broke things down efficiently. Within an hour, the whole system—faucet, filters, and storage tank—was up and running. It feels like the manufacturers kept non-handyman types in mind when designing the process, which I really appreciated.

**Highlights**  
- Removes up to 15 contaminants, including lead, chlorine, and sodium.  
- Easy-to-install, color-coded system with minimal tools required.  
- Sleek chrome faucet adds a modern touch to any kitchen.  
- NSF certification for peace of mind regarding water quality.  

[Check Whirlpool WHAROS5 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b071wm41b1/)

**Performance and Filtration Quality**  
With a rating of 4.6 stars, the filtration promises a lot, and during my testing, it delivered as advertised. The first time I sipped water filtered through this system, I could immediately taste the difference. Gone was the slight metallic tang that often accompanied the unfiltered tap water in my home. Instead, the system consistently provided clean, fresh-tasting water that even my 12-year-old niece—a self-declared “water connoisseur”—noticed. Moreover, the EZ-Change Indicator Light is a lifesaver. Not needing to guess when filters need replacement removes a common pain point from the ownership experience. It’s simple yet surprisingly effective.

**Maintenance Convenience**  
One thing I loved here is how hassle-free the maintenance is. The UltraEase filter replacement system is honestly a game changer. Instead of wrestling with tools or worrying about turning off the water supply, all it took was a quarter turn to remove the old filter and another quarter turn to lock in the new one. It took less time than making coffee, leaving me impressed. Busy schedules or interruptions? Absolutely no issue when managing this system.

**Pros**  
- UltraEase filter replacement allows for quick swaps with zero tools.  
- EZ-Change light advises precisely when maintenance is needed.  
- Significant improvements in water taste and odor elimination based on testing.

**Negatives**  
No product is perfect, and this one has its quirks. Firstly, the filters aren’t exactly budget-friendly, and while the replacement process is easy, regular maintenance costs can add up. Secondly, the water flow takes a slight hit. Given that storage happens in a pressurized tank, demand-heavy households might find the system struggling to keep up during peak times.

- Replacement filter costs could deter some budget-conscious buyers.  
- Flow rate slower than some other filtration systems, especially under heavy use.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at other reverse osmosis options, the APEC Water Systems ROES-50 often stands out due to its budget-friendly nature. However, it doesn’t quite match the Whirlpool WHAROS5 in terms of filter replacement ease or modern design. On the premium side, the iSpring RCC7 Filter System offers a superior water capacity, but the tradeoff is a bulkier and less kitchen-friendly design. The WHAROS5 balances these aspects beautifully, particularly with its compact dimensions and NSF certification.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Speaking of investments, this product sits firmly in the “you get what you pay for” category. While not the cheapest or the most feature-heavy, the combination of smart design, high-quality filtration, and ease of maintenance makes it a great contender for smart spending. If you prioritize clean drinking water but don’t want the hassle of a complicated system, this device will feel worth every penny.

1k7x48t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1k7x48t/悟りsatori/,悟り（SATORI）,"“You’ll die in three days,” the AI fortune-teller said.  
The boy didn’t laugh.Because it had never been wrong before.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
In a near-future Japan, AI fortune-telling had become a state-run service.  
The only legal one was called SATORI, a name meaning “enlightenment.”  
It drew from everything—your genome, search history, purchase data, brainwaves, even your late-night messages—to predict your “most probable fate.”  
“SATORI” spoke like a statue, serene and cold.  
“You will die alone, slipping on ice at a snowy intersection.  
Three days from now. 2:17 PM.”  
  
Kota, sixteen, nodded.  
He lived alone in a tiny apartment above a closed-down ramen shop.  
His mother and older brother had died in a crash two winters ago.  
School didn’t fit anymore. Neither did life.  
He wasn’t suicidal. But he had stopped expecting anything good.  
So he tried the machine. Just once. Just to know.  
  
He spent his remaining time like it was borrowed.  
He bought books, tipped strangers, fed a stray dog, treated a tired barista to coffee.  
At night, in his cold apartment with a warm heart, he thought,  
“Maybe it’s a little sad to go.”  
Then came the third day.  
Snow, right on schedule.  
He walked to the intersection.  
Not because he wanted to die.  
But because he wanted to see if the machine was right.  
  
That’s when he saw her—a little girl, backpack soaked, staring at the red light.  
The signal blinked green.  
A delivery van skidded around the corner.  
Kota ran.  
He pushed her out of the way.  
And then, the world flipped, the ground vanished, and his head hit the ice.  
So this is it, he thought as everything dimmed.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
But when he woke up, he was in a hospital bed.  
The doctor said it was a miracle.  
Just a mild concussion. The little girl was safe.  
Her parents cried when they saw him, bowing over and over.  
“If you hadn’t been there…”  
Kota smiled at the ceiling.  
SATORI was wrong.  
  
No—  
SATORI was right.  
Death had almost happened.  
But something human—unpredictable, irrational—had intervened.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
A week later, Kota returned to the machine.  
The same blank face. The same calm voice.  
“The prediction was accurate within 98.7% probability.  
You were statistically dead.  
But humans are strange.  
They act on meaning.”  
“Meaning?”  
“Yes. The urge to protect someone.  
The need to matter, even for a moment.  
These things don’t follow logic.  
They don’t show up in data.  
That’s what you call ‘free will.’”  
  
“So you’re not really fortune-telling, are you?” Kota said.  
“We assist. We do not decide.”  
Kota nodded.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
That night, he opened a notebook.  
On the cover, he wrote:  
  
UNPREDICTABLE  
  
He began to write—not about the future, but about someone.  
A story. A choice. A version of life not trapped by algorithms.  
His pen moved, slow and steady.  
And in the chill of that winter room, something quietly bloomed.

Comprehensive Review Here,"The **FrothBlast 44 Milk Frother Handheld** has truly surprised me with both its ingenuity and simplicity. As someone who enjoys the ritual of handcrafted beverages, I’ve found incorporating this handheld electric whisk into my routine a game-changer. It’s not just a kitchen gadget; it’s a companion to my cappuccinos, lattes, matcha, and beyond. Crafted with a stainless steel body and sporting a compact, lightweight design in sleek black, it makes a stellar first impression. Within days, this device became indispensable in my daily routine.

**Compact Yet Efficient Build**

Its slim, lightweight frame (merely 100 grams) was the first thing I noticed. A barely-there presence in my hand, it’s so compact, measuring 1.5 inches wide and 9 inches tall, that it fits tidily into my crowded utensil drawer. The stainless steel construction is both stylish and sturdy, feeling luxurious yet practical. I’ve accidentally dropped the frother on my kitchen tiles a couple of times, and it’s shown remarkable resilience—thankfully no dents or scratches. I can see this being a convenient tool for anyone with limited counter space.

**Ease of Use Steals the Show**

What amazed me instantly was its ease of operation. Powered by two AA batteries, the frother activates with a simple flick of its power button at the handle. It spins into action swiftly, and you’re left marveling at the silky foam it creates from even a small amount of milk. My 8-year-old could operate it without issues, which meant we suddenly had a fun family ritual of preparing frothy mochas and hot chocolate.

[Ready to snag FrothBlast 44? See Amazon’s price here.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09468kyfh/)

**Performance That Outshines Its Size**

This little dynamo is seriously powerful. Plunging it into whole milk, even just a couple of tablespoons, transforms the liquid into a lush, creamy froth in seconds. Heavy whipping cream, when mixed with a sprinkle of sugar, turned into thick, dreamy clouds of whipped cream almost instantaneously. While frothing, it remained stable in my hand without any vibrations, which is a bonus for clumsy mornings. However, there’s a caveat—its strength demands a touch of caution. If the cup isn’t deep or wide enough, the vigorous frothing could leave a bit of a mess. My advice? Start slow and experiment.

**Hygiene Couldn’t Be Simpler**

Cleaning up an appliance has never been a favorite task of mine, but this frother takes perhaps 10 seconds to clean. Running the whisk end under warm water or swirling it in a soapy cup does the trick quickly. Properly cleaned, there’s no lingering smell or residue left on the stainless steel whisk—a relief when alternating between drinks like coffee and matcha.

**Good Points**

- Compact and lightweight, making it easy to store.  
- Effortless one-button usage, even for kids.  
- Rapid frothing with rich, creamy results in just seconds.  
- Sturdy stainless steel construction ensures durability.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The power button can feel stiff after extended use.  
- It's top-heavy, and if left on its side, it might tip over easily.  
- Extremely vigorous frothing can cause splashes if the cup size isn’t appropriate.  

**Peer Products**

Comparing this product to other devices in the market, I noticed a few overlaps and a couple of distinctions worth highlighting. The Aerolatte Original is a similar handheld frother that boasts higher fame, mostly owing to its established reputation. However, I found its frothing power slightly weaker and slower than the FrothBlast 44. Another rival, the Bonsenkitchen Handheld Frother, comes with similar aesthetics, but one irksome detail arises: you often deal with wobbling vibrations. FrothBlast earns top marks for impeccable stability and consistent performance. That said, the Bonsenkitchen offers a double whisk feature, making it more versatile for larger-scale recipes.

**Bang for the Buck**

For the price I paid, this frother offers commendable value. Its stainless steel build, excellent functionality, and ease of maintenance make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their coffee-drink repertoire. While some competitors come with higher price tags, they fail to deliver such a seamless balance between performance and affordability. Whether you're an enthusiast of foamy cappuccinos or someone who loves topping your desserts with impeccable whipped cream, this frother justifies its cost in performance and dependability.

# Best Inline Water Filters of 2025: Top Reviews &⁢ Comparisons - Buy Smarter!

Are you tired ⁤of ​tap⁣ water with‍ a ‍questionable taste or unsure of its purity? Whether you're running a bustling ⁢restaurant, embarking on an ‍RV ​adventure, or simply seeking cleaner drinking water at‌ home, an⁢ inline ⁤water filter ⁢coudl⁤ be ⁤the perfect solution. In this complete guide, we'll dive deep into ‍the‌ world of inline water filters, exploring the best options available⁤ in⁢ 2025, comparing their features, and providing actionable‍ advice to help you choose the right filter for ‍your specific needs. we'll cover everything from inline refrigerator water ⁤filters ⁤to models designed for commercial and industrial applications.

## What is an‌ Inline ​Water Filter and Why ⁢Do You Need One?

An inline water filter is a type of water filtration system that connects ⁣directly to your water line.Unlike pitcher filters or⁣ faucet-mounted filters, inline filters are typically installed out​ of ⁤sight, providing a continuous supply of filtered water to‍ a specific outlet, like a refrigerator's ⁣water⁣ dispenser, ⁤an ice maker, a coffee maker, or even⁢ the entire plumbing system​ of an RV. They work by ⁣forcing water through a filtration⁣ media, removing impurities and contaminants that affect taste,⁢ odor, and⁤ overall water quality.

The⁤ benefits of⁢ using an inline water filter are numerous:

   **Improved Water Taste‌ and Odor:** Many inline filters use carbon filtration ‌to⁢ remove chlorine and othre‍ chemicals that contribute‌ to unpleasant tastes and odors. This results in considerably more palatable and refreshing drinking ⁢water. The water taste enhancement ⁤is frequently⁢ enough immediatly ‍noticeable.
   **Reduced Contaminants:** Inline filters can⁤ effectively⁣ remove a wide​ range of contaminants,including sediment,rust,lead,bacteria,and ⁣more,depending on the filter type and media used. This provides peace ‌of mind, knowing you're drinking ‌and⁤ using cleaner, safer water.
   **Protection of Appliances:** Hard water and ⁤sediment can damage appliances⁢ like refrigerators, ice⁢ makers, and coffee makers. An inline water​ filter helps protect these appliances from ​scale buildup and corrosion, extending their lifespan and reducing maintenance costs. Scale buildup can drastically affect the efficiency of machinery such as coffee machines.
   **Convenience and Cost-Effectiveness:** Once installed, an inline water filter ‍provides a continuous ⁤supply of filtered water without the need for‌ frequent refills or replacements.​ This‌ can ⁣be ⁢more convenient and cost-effective than other filtration methods.
   **Versatility:** Inline filters are ​available in a wide range of‍ sizes and ‌configurations to suit various⁤ applications, from small under-sink ‍filters‍ to large whole⁣ house⁣ inline water filter systems.

## Understanding ​Different Types of Inline Water Filters

The world of inline water filters can seem‍ overwhelming, but understanding the different​ types can help you ⁣narrow down your choices. Here's a rundown of some of the⁣ most common types:

   **Sediment‌ filters:** These filters are designed⁣ to ⁣remove sediment, rust, dirt, and other particulate matter ​from your water. A sediment filter​ inline‍ is crucial as a first​ stage of ‌filtration, protecting other filters from clogging and ensuring optimal performance.
   **Carbon Filters:** ⁤ Carbon ⁤filters are highly effective at removing chlorine, chloramine,⁣ organic compounds, and other chemicals that⁣ affect water taste ​and odor. ​They ⁢also contribute ⁢to water taste improvement. Carbon‌ filters ‌come ​in two main types:
       **Granular Activated ​Carbon (GAC) Filters:** These filters use ⁢loose granules of activated carbon to​ filter water. They are generally more affordable but ⁤may not be as ‌effective as carbon block ‌filters.*   **Carbon Block Filters:** These filters ⁤use a solid block of‍ compressed activated carbon. They offer⁣ superior filtration and ⁣a longer lifespan compared ‍to‌ GAC filters.*   **Ceramic ⁤filters:** ​ Ceramic filters ⁢use a ⁢porous ⁤ceramic material to ⁢remove bacteria,protozoa,and other ⁢microorganisms from water. They​ are often used in conjunction with other filtration methods for enhanced water purification.
   **Reverse Osmosis (RO) filters:** ⁢While frequently enough ⁣housed in a multi-stage‍ system, RO filters can⁤ sometimes be incorporated inline as a polishing stage. They use a semi-permeable membrane to remove a wide range of contaminants, including dissolved‍ solids, heavy metals,‌ and pharmaceuticals. An inline water filter for reverse osmosis is typically⁣ a carbon filter added to improve taste.
   **Specialty ⁣Filters:** These filters are designed to target specific contaminants, such as lead, fluoride, or arsenic. They may ​use specialized filtration media, such as⁢ ion ⁢exchange resins or activated alumina.

## Key​ Considerations When Choosing an Inline Water ‌Filter

Selecting the right inline water filter involves carefully considering ‌your ⁤specific ⁤needs and priorities. Here are some essential factors to keep​ in mind:

   **Water Quality:** Before choosing a filter, it's important⁢ to understand the‌ quality of‍ your water.​ Consider⁤ having‌ your ⁢water tested by a certified laboratory to identify any specific contaminants that need to be‍ addressed. This ​will help you choose‍ a filter with the appropriate filtration media and​ micron rating.
   **Flow rate:** The flow rate of an inline water filter is the amount of⁢ water ‌it ⁤can filter per minute. Choose a filter with a flow rate that meets your household or business's demand. A ⁣high flow ⁣inline water filter is essential for applications where a large volume of filtered water is needed ⁢quickly.
   **Filter Lifespan:** The‌ lifespan of an‍ inline water filter is the amount​ of⁤ time or ⁤gallons of ​water it can ‍filter ‍before ‌it needs to be replaced. Choose a filter with⁣ a lifespan that suits your usage patterns. ‌A ‌long lasting ‍inline water filter can save you time‌ and money in​ the long​ run.
   **Installation:** Consider the ease⁣ of ⁣installation when choosing an inline ⁣water filter. Some ⁢filters‌ are ⁤designed for​ easy DIY installation, while ⁤others may require professional plumbing assistance. Inline ‌water filter installation is generally straightforward but may require basic plumbing skills, especially when​ dealing with plumbed in water filters.
   **certification:** Look ⁤for inline water filters that⁢ are NSF certified. NSF certification ensures that the ⁣filter ⁤has ‍been tested and certified to meet industry ‍standards for ⁣water quality and​ safety. An NSF⁣ certified inline water filter provides assurance that the filter performs as advertised.
   **Cost:** Inline water filters vary in price depending on their features, filtration capacity, and brand. Consider ‌your budget ‌and choose a filter‌ that‌ offers‍ the best value ​for your money.‍ Factor⁤ in the cost of replacement‌ cartridges when calculating the overall cost of⁣ ownership.
   **Specific Application:** ‍Consider the specific application for which you need the inline water filter.For example, an inline refrigerator ⁢water filter requires different ​specifications than ‍an‌ inline water filter for ⁢RV.Pay attention to compatibility and sizing.

It went pretty well, nothing that was amazing but a decent guy that checked the boxes for me. He would text once a day and nothing more even if I asked a question. Meanwhile, he asked me to have dinner a week later. Okay now is where I had the red flags. I could not find this dude anywhere on social media. reverse phone number brought me no results, he received many notification on his phone that was turned over, told me he had a older women that lived with him for 10 years because she would have been homeless otherwise, but he thinks its time she moved out now. I asked him if they had been in a relationship, he said no. When I asked him what city he lived in he said north of the capital. We live in a major metropolitan area, so this could be 20 or more different places. Does this sound like a guy that is stepping out on his wife/girlfriend?",3,1745618023.0,Bumble,2,1.0,False

Celebration Steaks,"Dropped 9 lbs 218 > 209 with a water fast (some electrolytes and 1-2 cups of black coffee over the week). Had some rough acid reflux today and insomnia the last two nights. Could’ve went longer but I was running on empty and gave in. Regardless I’m so excited to sleep on a somewhat fuller belly haha.

Had about 16oz of prime ny strip after bone broth a few hours ago. Way too much food definitely a learning lesson that the stomach isn’t as big as it was a few days ago. Next time we ease into the grub.

Goal weight is 185 so going to IF 16:8 for the next few days than jump back in to another 72hr fast.

Happy fasting!

1k7wsxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k7wsxx/could_the_utopia_kitchen_french_press_review/,Could the Utopia Kitchen French Press Review Improve Your Coffee Brewing Experience?,"There’s something beautifully nostalgic about using a French press to brew coffee—it’s manual, straightforward, and pulls you into the moment. I’ve been testing the **Utopia Kitchen UKFRENCHPRESSPRNT 34 Ounce French Press**, and wow, it has a lot to talk about. From its design to its performance, this French press promises a solid coffee experience, though there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I couldn’t help but notice how sleek yet understated its black design is. The glass beaker, made of borosilicate glass, feels sturdy and reliable in hand. It claims to handle significant temperature changes, and during my tests, I didn’t observe a single crack or compromise in its structure, even when I poured boiling water straight into it. The 1-liter capacity provides enough coffee for an intimate coffee date or a small brunch table. The ergonomic handle is a little on the lighter side, though—it feels functional but could use a bit more weight for a premium touch.

**Superior Filtration System**  
Filtering coffee can make or break the French press experience, and here, this product gets a win. The four-filter sieve system really is the star. As someone who despises that gritty layer of residue in the last few sips, this was a relief. I brewed coarsely ground beans and pressed them slowly, and the output was smooth and rich. There's an 80-mesh filter involved, which sounded almost like overkill for regular coffee drinkers, but honestly, it proved its worth. My coffee came out clean, earthy, and full-bodied.  

**See [Utopia Kitchen UKFRENCHPRESSPRNT] price on Amazon.**  

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing with this French press is stupidly simple. Four steps—add coffee grounds, add hot water, stir, and press. That’s it. Even my friend who'd never touched a French press before tried it and succeeded in making a coffee that wasn’t half bad. The product also includes a coffee scoop, which is a nice touch. I liked how it allowed the measurements to stay consistent, though I mostly eyeball it. Cleaning up is straightforward as well; the plunger and filter are dishwasher safe.

**Performance Across Various Beverages**  
Although it's marketed as a coffee press, versatility is where this product surprised me. I tried it to brew some green tea, and it worked perfectly fine. Then, I got adventurous and made cold brew in it; the results were shockingly smooth. Its compact nature makes it perfect for camping trips or even offices where coffee machines aren't a luxury. A friend even borrowed it to froth milk for cappuccinos, though I wouldn’t say that’s its intended primary use.

**Key Benefits**  
- Superior 4-layer filtration for clean, residue-free coffee  
- Durable borosilicate glass is resistant to rapid temperature changes  
- Compact design easy to use at home or on the go  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleaning  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Not everything is perfect, though. A few issues became evident during extended use.  
- The lightweight handle feels cheap in comparison to the glass build.  
- The seals around the filters aren’t 100% spill-proof if you’re careless with pouring.  
- It doesn’t maintain warmth for very long; you’ll need to drink fast or use an additional thermal carafe.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
The French press coffee market is packed with options. Compared to the likes of the Bodum Chambord, this product holds its ground well. The Chambord boasts even more durable steel accents and better long-term reliability, but it comes at a higher price point. Alternatively, Oxo’s French press has thermal insulation, solving the warmth issue, but lacks the compact portability you get here. The Utopia Kitchen model positions itself well for those seeking affordability and decent construction without diving into premium coffee-pressing territory.

**Value for Money**  
Where this French press truly shines is in its cost-effectiveness. You’re getting something solid in design and functionality without breaking the bank. While it may lack some premium features like thermal insulation, those looking for a no-fuss manual coffee maker for daily brewing will likely be satisfied. Honestly, if you’re on a budget or just exploring manual brewing, this is worth considering.

I'm trading in my 2019 Toyota Highlander XLE that has been very good to me; but I want something a bit more ~luxury~ and also, faster. I've done a lot of research and the Q7 seems to be pretty much everything I'm looking for in my next car. The only thing I see being slightly annoying is shifting from a car that has a ton of space in the center console and dash for storage, to one that is basically a giant screen and a smaller center console. I also keep hearing that the cup holders suck(?) 😂 Which would be an issue- I'm an avid coffee drinker and in general always have a drink with me. The only other downside is that they don't come with a spare tire. I travel long distances, and just recently ran a flat that wasn't easily patchable. The spare the Highlander came with came in clutch. I plan on getting the Q7 equipped with manufacturer parts for a spare tire. Also kinda annoying, but apparently most newer luxury vehicles don't have spares anymore. I know the car comes with free roadside assistance for the first year, but I'm not trying to wait on a repair guy or tow truck at 4am when I have places to be and could just change out a tire myself. 🥲

I'd like to hear from 2022-2023 Q7 owners what their experiences have been. Any major issues I should be aware of? I know 2021's had a lot of engine and electrical issues. I plan on buying an Audi Certified Pre-Owned Q7 with less than 16-17k miles, as I'm able to find those in my price range *and* that usually guarantees decent manufacturer and dealership warranties. Please tell me the good, bad, and ugly and try to be as detailed as possible. This is a big decision for me, so I want to be well versed before I make the jump. ",1,1745617411.0,AudiQ7,0,1.0,False

It was a nice change from our tiny, cramped apartment overlooking the bustling city we had called home for so many years. Until the sink started talking to me.

It started out as quiet murmurs whenever somebody turned the tap on, but I wrote it off as the plumbing. It *was* an old house after all. Until one morning, I woke up to get water for the coffee pot, and I heard her clear as day for the first time.

""Hello? Can you hear me? I need help, please.""

I took a step back, bumping into the kitchen table and almost dropping the coffee pot. Then my husband, Harold, strolled into the room.

""Hey hun, where's the coffee? I gotta leave for work soon."" He said, doing up his tie and buttoning his cuffs.

""Harold, I just heard a woman's voice coming from the sink.""

""Babe, you're just hearing things. We were in the city a long time, your brain is just trying to fill in the gaps of silence with noise, look.""

Harold cupped his mouth with his hands and hunched over the sink.

""HELLOOOOO DOWN THERE!!"".

He paused before looking up at me with a big goofy grin. ""See? Nobody dow-""

Harold's words were cut short by the garbage disposal grinding to life and catching his tie, pulling him into the sink in a death-grip.

*HOLY SHIT, HAROLD!* I tried flicking the switch next to the sink to turn off the machine, but it was no use. Thinking fast, I quickly ran over to the kitchen drawer to grab a pair of scissors, and began snipping away at the back of the tie, severing my husband from his pinstripe noose.

Harald took a couple of deep breaths as we watched the rest of the tie being sucked down the sink like a starving man slurping spaghetti. As soon as the tie was out of sight, the garbage disposal shut off.

""Woah, that was scary. I didn't know that thing was automatic"" said Harold.

It wasn't. But I was too shaken up to let him know that.

Late that same night, I woke up totally parched and wandered into the kitchen for some water. I eyeballed the sink, but decided to grab something from the fridge instead.

As I rooted around for a bevy, I heard a soft, feminine voice from behind me.

""Hello? I know you're there. Please talk to me.""

Startled, I turned around to face the sink.

""H-hello? Who are you? *What* are you?"" I stammered out.

""My name is Melissa, and... I'm not sure what I am anymore."" She sounded sad and tired.

""Okay"" I said, trying to decide if I could make sense of what was going on, or if I had completely lost my mind. ""You turned on the garbage disposal earlier, right? You could have killed my husband!""

""I'm sorry, but I don't trust men. I don't want you to go through what I did. My husband murdered me after I caught him having an affair. He cut my heart out and jammed it down the garbage disposal.""

""I'm so sorry, that's awful"" I said; also realizing I would need to have a chat with my realtor about how they failed to mention a fucking *murder* had taken place in this house.

""Earlier, you said you needed help, right?"" I asked.

""Yes, it's an awfully big favor to ask. But please! I think you're my only hope to be set free"".

I was a little taken aback.

""How?"" I asked.

""My husband buried my remains somewhere under this house. I can't rest until they're properly buried. Please, I've been trapped in this sink for so long now."" Melissa said, weeping.

""Well, how will I know where to look?""

""With your new eye"" Melissa said. Then the tap turned on and began to run a fluorescent green liquid as she continued on. ""Just cover one eye, and run the other under this this. Be sure to bandage it up and wrap it in gauze afterwards. In the morning, cut the bandages off and you'll have a new eye, one that can see all things dead and far into the other side.""

I was a little shocked at her proposal. But I didn't know how shocked I could be. I *was* having a conversation with my kitchen sink. I approached the running faucet, hesitated, then held my hair behind my head with one hand, covered my right eye with the other and let the water trickle over my left.

The water had a weird tingling sensation to it. Like somebody was tickling the back of my eyeball with a feather and I desperately wanted to scratch it. I ignored the feeling until the water shut off.

""All done!"" Melissa said gleefully. ""I'm so excited for tomorrow! Quick, go bandage that bad boy up! I'll be waiting!""

I did just that. After dressing my eye, I felt lethargic and my body felt heavy. I shuffled my way back to bed and fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

When I woke up, everything felt wrong. I had a headache like a colony of fire-ants were throwing Coachella in my skull. I rolled over to see Harold had already gone to work. I looked past his spot on the mattress to the bedside clock, and saw it was almost 1pm.

I reached up to grab my throbbing temple, and felt the bandage I'd done up the night before. I walked out to the kitchen to grab some scissors and greeted Melissa, but she didn't respond.

*Maybe she can only talk at night?* I wondered, fumbling through the drawer for the scissors. I retrieved a pair and my headache began to worsen. I stumbled to the bathroom and did a double take when I got to the mirror.

My face looked gaunt and pale and my hair, previously voluminous and blonde, looked thin and brittle. I stifled a scream and opened the bathroom cabinet for some sort of painkiller, but everything was gone. Well, everything but a pair of nail clippers.

With a trembling hand, I focused my sights on the mirror and snipped the strand of bandage I had wrapped around my head, and unwound it until I was just looking at the gauze pad. I took a deep breath in, and began to peel it off.

I don't really know how to describe what I felt next. It was like an emotional cocktail of anger, sadness and disgust.

My iris, formally ice blue, was now a pale, milky, grey blotch. The rest of my eye was beyond a jaundice shade of yellow and looked more like a ball of rotten, coagulated turkey gravy left over from a thanksgiving's meal.

Another wave of pain surged throughout my head. I couldn't think anymore. I just had to act.

I ran into the kitchen and began screaming at Melissa, demanding to know what she had done to me. But again, there was no response. All I knew, was that I had to do something about that eye. The pain from it was blocking out all rational thought. I approached the drawer again, grabbed a spoon, and headed back to the bathroom.

It took several attempts to slide the spoon under my eye, but eventually I made it happen. When I tried to jimmy the spoon upwards to pop the eyeball out, the spoon simply slid through my pupil like jell-o. I made several more attempts, the pain worsening each time until I couldn't take it anymore and just jammed my index finger into the corner of my eye, hooked the optical nerve and pulled it out.

I reached down for the scissors where I placed them on the sink, but they were gone. I was in too much pain to keep looking for them and realized I would have to find another way to sever this abomination.

The spoon had slide through my eye no problem, but was too dull to saw through the cord. I tried stabbing at it several times as as it hung off my cheekbone, oozing yellow puss thick as dish soap with every thrust of the utensil.

That's when I remembered the nail clippers. I flung the cabinet open, grabbed them, and pulled my eyeball tight as I chewed away at the cord with them. After a painful minute or so that stretched on for an eternity, the cord snapped and shot back into my head like an elastic band. And I was left alone, lying on the cool, quiet, tile floor, clutching the smashed remains of my eyeball in my hand.

I crawled back out into the kitchen and began pleading for Melissa to talk to me. But instead of her soft, kitten-like voice, I heard a deep booming laugh echoing off the walls.

I'm terrified and don't know what to do now. All the doors and windows are locked, and every time I try to call Harold I just hear that fucking deep laugh. It's pitch black outside, so black it's like my house is sitting in a void. None of the clocks are working either, even the one on my phone keeps sporadically changing.

I summoned all my strength to go back and look in the bathroom mirror and saw a ghostly little figure in the dark hole where my eye was. Laughing, taunting, and beckoning me into my own skull. None of this makes any sense. I even googled the house and there was only one previous owner. No Melissa, no murder.

honesty i dont really know what to ask. i got sick almost a year ago with what i think was norovirus and was unwell for a few days, but every day since then i have felt nauseous, tired, lightheaded, etc, and i have developed severe, debilitating emetophobia. i was emetophobic before but not to this extent. almost every time i eat i experience severe nausea and acid reflux. more times than i can remember it has been so painful that i have begged to be taken to the hospital, only to wait for hours and be told to take gaviscon (which i had already taken and hadn’t worked). i was tested for h pylori and celiac, and it came back negative. it has been incredibly tough and i have had to drop out of college as a result. im autistic and have selective mutism and someone has to talk for me in doctors appointments usually and im not sure if that’s why i haven’t been taken seriously for the last 20ish appointments that i have had with my local surgery. i was referred to a gastroenterologist in december with an expediting letter and i still haven’t received an appointment. my mother called the hospital that i was referred to last week and was told that there could be another 4-5 months until i get an appointment. this is literally unbearable and my mother has explicitly told doctors that it is affecting my quality of life and that i have been having suicidal thoughts as a result. we looked into getting seen privately but theres only one gastroenterologist at the closest private hospital and their waiting times are the same, plus we wouldn’t be able to afford it in the long run. i feel like my life has been taken away from me, i have lost my autonomy, my social life, and it feels like i have lost my future too. I plan on going back to college in september but i have no idea if i’ll be able to handle it. it was bad enough before this, as i’d already suffered from long covid for two years before this and received zero medical support. i feel utterly hopeless and like i will never be able to return to normal. i miss not having to remember to take lanzoprazole every morning before i eat so i’m not bed ridden with my head in a bucket waiting to throw up (but then i never do), i miss eating what i want without worrying if it’ll make it worse, i miss eating whole meals, i miss not feeling like my stomach is churning at all times, i miss not worrying it flaring up on special occasions and ruining it, i miss not feeling like a burden to my parents, i miss not being at home every day not able to do anything but lie in bed or sit at my desk because moving too much makes me faint, i miss feeling normal. i miss getting up every day at 7am to drink my coffee and get to college and then come home to play video games or go hang out with friends. i am so utterly thankful to my boyfriend and my two closest friends who have stuck by me through this because they have been my lifeline. if it wasn’t for them i probably wouldn’t even be alive. they’ve made effort to hang out with me and always listened when i needed to vent. but im just not sure where to go from here because i can’t keep living like this. ive never been religious but i don’t think i could ever be now, knowing that god could put me through this with no mercy. that sounds edgy as hell my bad",5,1745617032.0,ChronicIllness,1,1.0,False
1k7wlrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftirving/comments/1k7wlrf/the_woman_in_my_drain_started_speaking_to_me_and/,"The woman in my drain started speaking to me, and I wish I never listened","Last week, me and my husband moved into a small house we bought deep in the country.

It was a nice change from our tiny, cramped apartment overlooking the bustling city we had called home for so many years. Until the sink started talking to me.

It started out as quiet murmurs whenever somebody turned the tap on, but I wrote it off as the plumbing. It *was* an old house after all. Until one morning, I woke up to get water for the coffee pot, and I heard her clear as day for the first time.

""Hello? Can you hear me? I need help, please.""

I took a step back, bumping into the kitchen table and almost dropping the coffee pot. Then my husband, Harold, strolled into the room.

""Hey hun, where's the coffee? I gotta leave for work soon."" He said, doing up his tie and buttoning his cuffs.

""Harold, I just heard a woman's voice coming from the sink.""

""Babe, you're just hearing things. We were in the city a long time, your brain is just trying to fill in the gaps of silence with noise, look.""

Harold cupped his mouth with his hands and hunched over the sink.

""HELLOOOOO DOWN THERE!!"".

He paused before looking up at me with a big goofy grin. ""See? Nobody dow-""

Harold's words were cut short by the garbage disposal grinding to life and catching his tie, pulling him into the sink in a death-grip.

*HOLY SHIT, HAROLD!* I tried flicking the switch next to the sink to turn off the machine, but it was no use. Thinking fast, I quickly ran over to the kitchen drawer to grab a pair of scissors, and began snipping away at the back of the tie, severing my husband from his pinstripe noose.

Harald took a couple of deep breaths as we watched the rest of the tie being sucked down the sink like a starving man slurping spaghetti. As soon as the tie was out of sight, the garbage disposal shut off.

""Woah, that was scary. I didn't know that thing was automatic"" said Harold.

It wasn't. But I was too shaken up to let him know that.

Late that same night, I woke up totally parched and wandered into the kitchen for some water. I eyeballed the sink, but decided to grab something from the fridge instead.

As I rooted around for a bevy, I heard a soft, feminine voice from behind me.

""Hello? I know you're there. Please talk to me.""

Startled, I turned around to face the sink.

""H-hello? Who are you? *What* are you?"" I stammered out.

""My name is Melissa, and... I'm not sure what I am anymore."" She sounded sad and tired.

""Okay"" I said, trying to decide if I could make sense of what was going on, or if I had completely lost my mind. ""You turned on the garbage disposal earlier, right? You could have killed my husband!""

""I'm sorry, but I don't trust men. I don't want you to go through what I did. My husband murdered me after I caught him having an affair. He cut my heart out and jammed it down the garbage disposal.""

""I'm so sorry, that's awful"" I said; also realizing I would need to have a chat with my realtor about how they failed to mention a fucking *murder* had taken place in this house.

""Earlier, you said you needed help, right?"" I asked.

""Yes, it's an awfully big favor to ask. But please! I think you're my only hope to be set free"".

I was a little taken aback.

""How?"" I asked.

""My husband buried my remains somewhere under this house. I can't rest until they're properly buried. Please, I've been trapped in this sink for so long now."" Melissa said, weeping.

""Well, how will I know where to look?""

""With your new eye"" Melissa said. Then the tap turned on and began to run a fluorescent green liquid as she continued on. ""Just cover one eye, and run the other under this this. Be sure to bandage it up and wrap it in gauze afterwards. In the morning, cut the bandages off and you'll have a new eye, one that can see all things dead and far into the other side.""

I was a little shocked at her proposal. But I didn't know how shocked I could be. I *was* having a conversation with my kitchen sink. I approached the running faucet, hesitated, then held my hair behind my head with one hand, covered my right eye with the other and let the water trickle over my left.

The water had a weird tingling sensation to it. Like somebody was tickling the back of my eyeball with a feather and I desperately wanted to scratch it. I ignored the feeling until the water shut off.

""All done!"" Melissa said gleefully. ""I'm so excited for tomorrow! Quick, go bandage that bad boy up! I'll be waiting!""

I did just that. After dressing my eye, I felt lethargic and my body felt heavy. I shuffled my way back to bed and fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

When I woke up, everything felt wrong. I had a headache like a colony of fire-ants were throwing Coachella in my skull. I rolled over to see Harold had already gone to work. I looked past his spot on the mattress to the bedside clock, and saw it was almost 1pm.

I reached up to grab my throbbing temple, and felt the bandage I'd done up the night before. I walked out to the kitchen to grab some scissors and greeted Melissa, but she didn't respond.

*Maybe she can only talk at night?* I wondered, fumbling through the drawer for the scissors. I retrieved a pair and my headache began to worsen. I stumbled to the bathroom and did a double take when I got to the mirror.

My face looked gaunt and pale and my hair, previously voluminous and blonde, looked thin and brittle. I stifled a scream and opened the bathroom cabinet for some sort of painkiller, but everything was gone. Well, everything but a pair of nail clippers.

With a trembling hand, I focused my sights on the mirror and snipped the strand of bandage I had wrapped around my head, and unwound it until I was just looking at the gauze pad. I took a deep breath in, and began to peel it off.

I don't really know how to describe what I felt next. It was like an emotional cocktail of anger, sadness and disgust.

My iris, formally ice blue, was now a pale, milky, grey blotch. The rest of my eye was beyond a jaundice shade of yellow and looked more like a ball of rotten, coagulated turkey gravy left over from a thanksgiving's meal.

Another wave of pain surged throughout my head. I couldn't think anymore. I just had to act.

I ran into the kitchen and began screaming at Melissa, demanding to know what she had done to me. But again, there was no response. All I knew, was that I had to do something about that eye. The pain from it was blocking out all rational thought. I approached the drawer again, grabbed a spoon, and headed back to the bathroom.

It took several attempts to slide the spoon under my eye, but eventually I made it happen. When I tried to jimmy the spoon upwards to pop the eyeball out, the spoon simply slid through my pupil like jell-o. I made several more attempts, the pain worsening each time until I couldn't take it anymore and just jammed my index finger into the corner of my eye, hooked the optical nerve and pulled it out.

I reached down for the scissors where I placed them on the sink, but they were gone. I was in too much pain to keep looking for them and realized I would have to find another way to sever this abomination.

The spoon had slide through my eye no problem, but was too dull to saw through the cord. I tried stabbing at it several times as as it hung off my cheekbone, oozing yellow puss thick as dish soap with every thrust of the utensil.

That's when I remembered the nail clippers. I flung the cabinet open, grabbed them, and pulled my eyeball tight as I chewed away at the cord with them. After a painful minute or so that stretched on for an eternity, the cord snapped and shot back into my head like an elastic band. And I was left alone, lying on the cool, quiet, tile floor, clutching the smashed remains of my eyeball in my hand.

I crawled back out into the kitchen and began pleading for Melissa to talk to me. But instead of her soft, kitten-like voice, I heard a deep booming laugh echoing off the walls.

I'm terrified and don't know what to do now. All the doors and windows are locked, and every time I try to call Harold I just hear that fucking deep laugh. It's pitch black outside, so black it's like my house is sitting in a void. None of the clocks are working either, even the one on my phone keeps sporadically changing.

I summoned all my strength to go back and look in the bathroom mirror and saw a ghostly little figure in the dark hole where my eye was. Laughing, taunting, and beckoning me into my own skull. None of this makes any sense. I even googled the house and there was only one previous owner. No Melissa, no murder.

I'm looking worse with I can only assume is every hour passing. This has to be some kind of demon, but what? Do any of you have some advice?",1,1745616982.0,shiftirving,0,1.0,False

So my wife and my parents do not get along. We got married in August of last year and found out we were pregnant shortly after (Honeymoon baby). My wife went into super protective mom mode and also being newly married we had to figure out how to split holidays with each other’s side of the family. Well we had Thanksgiving with my family and my mom shortly after came over to our house to accuse my wife (she wanted to talk with her 1:1 but wife insisted I be there) of pulling away from the family, all because she said we would not be able to make it to a planned family trip in August due to us having a new baby (baby would be 3 mos. old). The trip would be a ferry ride away (2 hours) then a 2 hour drive, to a remote cabin with little amenities. The nearest medical care was 45 minutes away driving. My parents like to adventure on holiday and the trip would be kayaking hiking etc. All reasons my wife said NO to attending. My mother did not understand this, though, and blamed my wife. The visit culminated with her calling my wife negative energy, saying she would restructure the group WhatsApp chat to remove her, and saying she doesn’t need my wife’s negative energy in her life. 

From that point on, my wife began to really dislike my mother. No apology was given but my mother would send guilt trip letters to the effect of ‘we only have one family and we have to put this behind us’. But again no apology. We replied back that we are looking for a proper apology or we would have a hard time putting it behind us. No response - she ghosted us for weeks till we reached out again and asked if she was going to reply. She said ‘no need to respond. Everything I need to say has been said’. Then a few weeks later reached out to ask for photos of our travel abroad, as if nothing happened. Wife was really upset at this because she felt my mother was just trying to pretend nothing was wrong and continue on as normal. 

In March, my mom reached out again and asked to meet us for coffee. We asked her what about and she said to apologize. We met her. Her idea of an apology was to say she was having a hard time at the time and felt we were pulling away and not giving her support. No apology to my wife again for calling her negative energy etc. My wife explained that it was unfair behaviour because we had just gotten married, found out we were pregnant, were developing our lives as newlyweds AND moving into a new condo. That she has to understand we are going to focus on our own family and will make choices that make sense for us, and shouldn’t be punished for it. That it doesn’t mean we are pulling away… my mother just stared at her and did not say anything. We left.

My mother texted me a few days later and asked me to meet for coffee ‘no agenda, just to catch up :)’ and I said sure but my wife was upset with this as she felt my mother was just trying to angle her way back in without my wife in the way. I went to the meeting and explained things still would not go back to normal without a proper apology. She then called my brother crying and he sent me a big text message basically saying what an a****** I was. My mother has also looped in my aunt to try to get us to ‘see their side’ as they feel they have ‘done everything they can’ so basically the whole family is involved. 

My wife has told my mother that unless a proper apology occurs, she is unlikely to move forward. Fast forward to today and my wife’s mother has planned to throw her a baby shower a month after baby is born and invited MY mother. My wife is not comfortable her being there given the events of the past 8/9 months and is asking her mother to cancel it because she feels it will cause drama. This is because I told my wife she would be a vindictive b**** if I did not let my mother hold the baby. My wife packed her things and left to go stay at her parents as she was so angry with me. 

I feel she just can’t handle that I have a different opinion than her as to how to move this forward. I think she should let my mother attend the shower, hold the baby, and be allowed to visit the hospital once baby is here. I feel this will cause them to see what they are missing and it will force them to apologize. 

My wife is furious and says I am putting her second to my parent’s wants and needs. That they do not deserve to hold baby etc. after they have treated her like dirt. That it would be rewarding poor behaviour and letting them know they can behave poorly and still have access to baby. She is horrified that she will be in a vulnerable post partum state and be expected to entertain my parents and let them hold their grandchild. 

She said I am failing as a husband and took off her rings and left. That she won’t raise her son this way setting an example that poor behaviour gets rewarded and won’t let him be around toxic people. 

I think she is just angry and can’t accept that this is the better position to take because if not, my parents will keep escalating the situation and sending letters and messages and etc. etc. My wife says none of this is our problem and if they do that, we just block them. I told her that I don’t agree with her approach but will support her. She does not believe me and says it’s just lip service and that how I really feel is that she IS a vindictive b*** and that I really just want a relationship with my family. I did tell her that ideally I am
able to do both.

1k7whyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1k7whyx/spoiler_free_epic_passholder_preview_review/,*Spoiler free* Epic Passholder Preview Review,"My husband and I were fortunate enough to pick up preview tickets and spend the day at Epic on Wednesday April 23. In short, we were blown away and cannot wait to go back in May for opening weekend. I was going to write a really long and detailed review, but I think what made our experience so fantastic was that both of us avidly avoided spoilers in the form of photos, videos, and descriptions before we went to the park. We are huge Universal stans and we knew going in that previews could be disappointing on the ride front, but we were prepared to have a good time no matter what happened with rides. We did get to go on every single ride in the park, but different rides were down for extended periods of time throughout the day. This is a technical rehearsal, and we adjusted accordingly.

We walked over from Stella Nova at 8:45am just to get ahead of the resort busses running at 9am. Barely anyone was at the gate when we got there. They let us through security at 9:45 and into the main gate a few minutes before 10am. We did not beeline straight for Nintendo like everyone else, instead grabbing a coffee and taking a long loop around Celestial Park. 

Celestial Park is beautiful. It is awe-inspiring. Every inch and every angle is perfect. I couldn't stop leaking tears and we stopped and took in every view we could, using that hour with limited patrons to the best of our ability. My biggest takeaway of the day is this: look at everything. There are so many small details that are absolutely perfect and breathtaking. The ceilings in every room and under every awning are spectacular. Every food place, fountain, floor tile, and lamppost is meticulously decorated in this entire park.

Nintendo World: The portal is so fun and again, every inch of that area has details that left us literally breathless and leaking more tears. We purchased Power Up bands at the hotel gift shop after someone in the lobby suggested it, and we're glad we did. You'll want to immediately jump in and play, and the Power Up bands allow you to fully take advantage of all of those features. We stopped into Toadstool Cafe just to look around and headed back to DK area also just to look around. We did not get in line for rides because we knew the lines would be better later. We honestly could have stayed in this area half of the day just exploring every inch of the world, but we moved on at 11. The leaderboard system on the app and the collectible hidden items are pretty addictive. I'm competitive and it was hard to tear myself away from collecting points. We came back much later to ride all three rides. Yoshi is very cute and is worth it for the views. Donkey Kong was honestly a letdown for me. It was jarring and jerky and just didn't live up to the hype it's getting. Mario Kart was fun and it was easy to follow directions. I think it would also be a fun ride without the VR headset, though. I will try that some day. 

We stopped for breakfast at the Oak and Star Tavern. The breakfast was great and the interior was so cute. I'm actually obsessed with the details in this setting I haven't seen many people talking about this place but it's the perfect place to get out of the heat in Celestial and have a drink and a barbecue centered meal. 

Berk: headed here after breakfast when everything opened and again, floored by how beautiful that world is at every turn and every inch. I was delighted by the small details hiding everywhere, and transported by the music. We rode the two dry rides in there first and came back later for Fyre Drill. We both tried a Mac and Cheese cone spire. Hiccup's was delightful, the Dragon Racer Rally poses a unique challenge that I think I'll come back to try again later, and don't go on Fyre Drill unless you want to be utterly drenched (It was 90 degrees, we wanted to be drenched). I think this will be the place I want to keep coming back to in down time because of how colorful and adorable it is. It was also less overstimulating than Nintendo.

Stardust Racers: Rode both sides with only a 5 minute wait. Fantastic coaster. In my opinion neither side is better than Velocicoaster, but that's totally my opinion. They are still unique and fun tracks and there are some fun little surprises that will make this worth any wait. 

Harry Potter: I had tempered expectations for this area even though HP is my lingering comfort IP, but the entrance with the music is fantastic and there are as many tiny details to pay attention to as there are in Diagon. It's more spacious than Diagon and Hogsmeade combined. The Cafe L'air de la Serene was charming and had a fun menu. Everything is in French back there, even the signage. It's that true to theme. We did get to ride the Ministry ride and it was honestly pretty fantastic in terms of fun and effects. The queue is as good as Rise of the Resistance in that the big reveal is done well and is unexpected, leaving you gasping in delight and fully immersed in the world.

Dark Universe: Curse of the Werewolf was down for most of the morning but it was posted that Monsters was going to close early, so we headed over here as soon as it seemed like there was a break in the line after the rush that came from Wolf opening. Monsters Unchained was phenomenal and unique. At the end of the ride they asked if we wanted to stay on and go again and we definitely did. Perfect. Seemed like everything was working for us and it would have been worth probably a 90 minute to 2 hour wait, honestly. Curse of the Werewolf is too short but it was still really fun and surprisingly fast. Both restaurants over there are great and we got to interact with some scare actors at the Burning Blade Tavern while we enjoyed a drink. 

At night we rode Curse of the Werewolf again and then took another long lap around the park to see it from every angle at night, again just taking advantage of the emptiness of the park. We got to see Darkmore and Celestial in complete darkness and they were stunning. Stardust was down after 8pm so we didn't get a night ride of that, but we finished the night out on Constellation Carousel, which has great music and pretty lights at night. I recommend waiting to ride this at night as it's obviously what it was built for.

Overall takeaways: There are enough places to sit in the shade. I don't know why people are complaining so much about the lack of shade in these reviews. There are open spaces, yes, but there are shops and awnings and benches if you need a break. Berk might be the only land that had most of its sitting areas in the direct sun, but there's a central sitting area under a canvas with fans. Some of the queues are outside but covered and also fanned. I didn't feel overwhelmed by lack of shade at all. It's no worse than Universal Studios, where as a pale person I almost always get burnt no matter how much sunscreen I use.

Get the power up band before you get into the park. The wand areas aren't as developed as they are in the old parks quite yet, but a wand is still probably worth it because there are a few spots that were obviously developed with the 2.0 wands in mind.

Look up, down, sideways, backwards. This park is a masterpiece of architecture and detail. It is a painting from every way you see it.

We didn't get to eat nearly enough or watch the shows. The emptiness of the preview made it ideal for exploring and just taking everything in while we could. It'll never be this empty again. 

I recommend getting a preview ticket if you can. It was worth the flight and the ticket price just to be able to witness this park without huge crowds. Everyone you see is so excited to be there, TMs and patrons alike. I loved standing back and watching other people come through portals and lose their minds just like I did. We will be back for opening weekend, and we cannot wait. This park is Epic and more beautiful than I was expecting, and there's nothing like it and probably never will be again.",19,1745616708.0,UniversalOrlando,9,1.0,False

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — let’s call him Charles — and now I’m questioning how I handled things and whether I’m being too sensitive or if I need to set firmer boundaries.

Charles and I met through my school’s library, and we clicked pretty quickly. I ended up opening up to him about some deeply personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. I thought he was someone I could trust.

Over time, things started to shift. He brought me to his church group, which I initially liked, but then he and his brother began pushing political conversations — especially pro-Trump stuff — even after I said I wasn’t comfortable talking about politics. At one point, he kept pressing me about whether my beliefs were “just inherited from my dad,” and when I didn’t want to answer, he wouldn’t drop it.

I eventually told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. He refused to apologize over text and insisted we meet in person (also told me the friendship is over prior to meeting). When we did, I even bought him a coffee, trying to smooth things over, but instead of apologizing, he basically told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down, and that I was ""talking like the devil."" He also tried to pray with me, which I declined. The whole thing left me feeling belittled and disrespected, so I walked away and decided to end the friendship.

Since then, I’ve stepped back from the church group and distanced myself from anyone in his circle. But lately, I’ve started feeling anxious — his brother randomly removed me on LinkedIn, and Charles has acted like nothing happened when he sees me, giving me fist bumps and being weirdly friendly. Some of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t responded much — just said I’m busy.

Now I’m worried he might be sharing personal things I told him during our friendship — especially the mental health stuff — and using it to make me look bad. I feel like I’ve lost control of the narrative and it’s eating at me.

1k7what,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1k7what/most_of_us_are_likely_not_getting_enough/,"Most of us are likely not getting enough magnesium, and dark chocolate and cacao are not just good sources, they are VERY good sources of magnesium.","I am an independent researcher that has committed to scientifically justifying eating chocolate frequently, if not everyday. I know that everyone, to some degree, has heard in the news or media of chocolate and cacao having health benefits, but I intend to get into the nitty gritty into the hows and whys. At this point I've essentially arrived to the conclusion that chocolate, can indeed be some sort of ""biohack"" food. So I've decided to consolidate the information I've come across to list all the reasons as to why. But also investigating the topics that most chocolatiers would rather not discuss, such as heavy metals and unethical labor. With that being said, I’d like to share with you all the first reason that I add to my list of chocolate eating excuses. 

Most of us are likely not getting enough magnesium in our diets to be optimally healthy, and dark chocolate and cacao are not just good sources, they are *very* good sources of magnesium. 

Magnesium is a foundational mineral needed for over 300 processes in your body, and not getting enough can contribute to just about every disease that you can imagine from Alzheimer's to osteoporosis. 

That is why It’s unfortunate that an overwhelming amount of people around the world are not getting enough of it. In the U.S. I was able to find several publications stating that around half of people from the early 2000’s to 2016 weren’t getting enough magnesium. ^(1) ^(2) ^(3) But it’s not an issue exclusive to the United States, it’s a rather worldwide problem. ^(4) ^(5) ^(6) ^(7)

In addition, throughout the years there have been several experts who have stated that they actually disagree with the conventional RDA set by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) ^(5,) and have advocated to set the bar even higher. Notably, Dr. Shari Lieberman And Dr. Andrea Rosanoff.

Dr. Shari Lieberman , PhD in clinical nutrition and exercise physiology and certified nutrition specialist was a prominent nutrition scientist and author up until she passed away in 2010 due to breast cancer. She specialized in vitamins, minerals, and integrative health and advocated for what she believed was Optimal Daily Intake (ODI) for nutrients that were starkly different than the conventional RDA’s established by the FNB.  She suggested 500-750 mg of magnesium per day for most individuals for optimal health. ^(6)

Dr. Andrea Rosanoff is a nutritional biologist with a PhD in nutrition, and is one of, if not the world’s leading expert in magnesium research, focusing on its role in human health. She is also concerned with the fact that an overwhelming amount of people aren’t getting enough magnesium, and is similarly advocating for change in the conventional RDA’s for magnesium. Going as far as to say that 800+ mg of magnesium could be best for those with high blood pressure, blood glucose, or cholesterol. ^(8) 

The fact that we aren’t getting enough of the conventional RDA of magnesium is concerning enough, but if the ideal intakes are indeed more like Dr. Shari Lieberman’s and Dr. Andrea Rosanoff’s recommendations then the issue is much more grave than we think as visualized by table 1.



[Table 1 \(4 5 6 7 8\)](https://preview.redd.it/68sxb5f2t1xe1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb1435c91402c34cbe6045740c212ca9e0083041)

Now you could try to supplement, but that has its own caveats and issues because not every magnesium supplement is the same quality as others. And even then, there is evidence that supplemental magnesium is not the same nor as effective as dietary magnesium. ^(9) This is not exclusive to magnesium, but a rather constant theme in the nutritional literature time and time again is that supplemental nutrients do not necessarily give the same benefit as dietary nutrients. ^(10) ^(11) ^(12) Yes, I’m sure that supplements may be a viable intervention for some people, but it doesn’t change the fact that both deficient and non deficient people should prioritize getting their nutrients from food.

So the logical thing is to eat your magnesium. Looking on the NIH website ^(13), you can see a table of some of the top foods that contain magnesium for every serving, but they did not mention cacao or dark chocolate. So I took the liberty of adding it for them.\*

[Table 2 \(13 14 15\)](https://preview.redd.it/8wi11gq3t1xe1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=6188a857cd76ecff3faf3028a66c51341c90896e)

Cacao powder has ton of magnesium in it, with 100 grams providing up to 499 mg of magnesium, which is  119-125% of the RDA established by the FNB. ^(14 15)  Now obviously, no one is going to straight up eat 100 grams of cacao powder and you really shouldn’t aim to get all of your dietary magnesium from cacao anyway. Too much of anything can be a bad thing. And it is no different with chocolate (unfortunately). But the reason it's significant is because, gram for gram, cacao is more mineral dense than most other magnesium rich foods. While not the number one spot, cacao and dark chocolate would rank very high on the table they provided.

But what makes cacao stand out from other magnesium sources, is that it also has a ton of complementary nutrients, antioxidants, and polyphenols, on top of being very magnesium dense. The polyphenols and other nutrients present in cacao might help in the absorption of its magnesium, making it potentially more bioavailable than other magnesium foods, even those that have more magnesium by sheer number. Now to be clear, this is an extrapolation, I wasn’t able to find any direct studies comparing magnesium bioavailability in cacao to other foods. But even if this does not turn out to be necessarily true, the presence of these nutrients and polyphenols have their own list of benefits that I'll cover in a future post. The nutrient profile between cacao and the other foods is generally comparable, except for the polyphenol content.  Cacao doesn't just have a higher presence of polyphenols, it has a dramatically higher presence of polyphenols. For reference, the top 2 foods that surpass cacao are chia seeds and pumpkin seeds which have  3.5 mg GAE/g and 9.8 mg GAE/g of polyphenols respectfully.^(16 17) Whereas cacao can have up to 56 mg GAE/g (This is assuming the highest polyphenol content I was able to find for each of these foods). ^(18)

With that I conclude that cacao is not just a good source to get your magnesium from, it is a very good source to consider. And establish my first scientifically justified reason as to why we should eat chocolate frequently, if not everyday.

1k7wfeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1k7wfeb/does_us_traveler_lightweight_carryon_luggage/,Does U.S. Traveler Lightweight Carry-On Luggage Truly Deliver? Honest Review Inside!,"The U.S. Traveler US5600C20 Lightweight Rolling Carry-On Luggage hits that sweet spot for frequent travelers like me who prioritize portability without completely sacrificing durability or style. Having relied on this compact camouflage-patterned piece during multiple weekend getaways and business trips, I’ve grown familiar with its ups and downs. It’s a great entry-level option for casual flyers, though there are a few quirks you’ll want to consider.

**A Compact Design that Surprises**  
This rolling carry-on stands out not just for its camouflage aesthetic but also for its lightweight design, tipping the scale at a mere 1.3 pounds. It cleverly fits the FAA carry-on regulations, which is perfect for avoiding the hassle of checked luggage. The slim profile—measuring 13.5 x 7.5 x 21 inches—means it doesn’t hog space in airplane overhead bins. One time, someone even complimented me on how effortlessly I stowed it on a packed flight. However, being compact does come with limits, and that brings us to its storage capacity.  

**Spacious Interiors with Extra Perks**  
Don’t let its exterior fool you—its fully lined interior offers well-thought-out storage solutions. Tie-down straps and a large mesh zippered pocket kept my clothes and travel essentials organized, even during bumpy rides. Thanks to its expandable feature, I managed to squeeze in some souvenirs on my return flights. That piggy-back strap on the smaller tote? Absolute lifesaver for freeing up my hands, especially when juggling airport coffee and boarding passes. While it isn’t massive enough for extended vacations, it’s perfect for short trips where a minimalist approach rules.  

[Check U.S. Traveler US5600C20 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0ckkybpsf/)

**Gliding Through Crowded Airports**  
Ease of mobility is where this bag delivers a solid punch. The two skate wheels and retractable push-button handle system make it very maneuverable, even in the chaos of a busy terminal. I was able to roll it smoothly alongside me, whether dashing to catch a connecting flight or making my way down narrow airplane aisles. Unfortunately, the two-wheel setup has its drawbacks. If heavily packed, balance becomes a real issue; I’ve had it tip over while standing in queues. While it meets the most basic needs, a four-wheel spinner system would have been a game-changer for seamless handling.  

**Materials and Build Quality**  
Constructed with high-quality 1200D polyester, this carry-on does well to protect against wear and tear. The camouflage print also scores practicality points by masking dirt and stains, which is great when you’re always on the go. Even after repeated use, the water-resistant material kept my belongings dry during a random drizzle. That said, you'll quickly notice the “affordable” build once you unzip the compartments or extend the handle. The materials, while functional, have a slightly cheap feel. It works fine for light to moderate use, but I wouldn’t recommend it for rugged travelers.

**Highlights**  
- Compact size and lightweight design  
- TSA-accepted dimensions suitable for carry-on  
- Expandable interior with well-planned storage  
- Retractable push-button handle for comfortable handling  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Two-wheel design struggles with balance when heavily packed  
- Build quality feels slightly cheap for frequent, heavy usage  
- Limited capacity makes it best for short trips  

**Competing Options**  
While the U.S. Traveler Lightweight Carry-On is a capable choice, a comparison with other products highlights some differences. The Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Spinner offers superior durability and a slick hard case perfect for heavy-duty use but trades off on weight and flexibility. The AmazonBasics Hardside Spinner comes with an affordable price tag and a four-wheel design for more seamless maneuvering. However, both of these lack the camouflage design and the practicality of the included smaller tote bag that this offering brings. Ultimately, you’ll be weighing portability and budget against stability and premium features when considering these alternatives.

**Quality for Price**  
For those operating on a budget, this carry-on strikes a balance between practicality and affordability. Its features align well with its lower price range, offering just enough style and utility to handle everyday travel needs. If you don’t fly regularly or require luggage with elite-level features, it does get the job done without much fuss. For me, it’s a bag for short escapades rather than a long-haul hero.

“Where do they come from?”

Coffee is grown in over 70 countries across the world. Its traditionally grown along the “coffee belt” which sits between the tropics of cancer and Capricorn. This includes Central & South America, Central Africa, India, and South-east Asia. The largest producer is Brazil, who produces more than a third of the world’s coffee.

For the coffee plant to grow, the location needs to have the right altitude, weather and soil. But where is that?

“The process”

The plant is bush-like and can grow to 8ft tall but are normally trimmed around 6ft, and can live between 30-40 years. The coffee beans are actually a seed found inside the cherries that grow on this plant. After a year the plant produces jasmine-like flowers, after another 3 – 5 years they produce fruit, this fruit is then picked for the coffee beans and can be harvested at a rate sustainable for commercial production, around 80-100 kilos of cherries per day (176 – 220 lbs.).

“Coffee Producing Countries”

Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sumatra, Vietnam, Indonesia, Honduras, Peru and India being the largest producers in the world with each country having a unique flavor.

“The further process”

After collection the seeds are removed from the cherries, fermented, milled (cut to shape), then roasted which involves heating the beans to over 400F for the preferred characteristics and flavors before being packaged.

""Coffee’s Economic Impact""

In 2023, the National Coffee Association published its first update since 2015 to the NCA U.S. Coffee Economic Impact Report.

Two-thirds of American adult’s drink coffee each day and more than 70% of American adults drink coffee each week, making coffee America’s favorite beverage.

""Highlighted economic impacts of coffee in the United States""

\- The economic impact in the United States in 2022 was 343.2B, up 52.4% since 2015

\- The coffee industry is responsible for more than 2.2M U.S. jobs and generates more than $ 100B in wages per year

\- Coffee can only be grown in tropical areas not including the US so it is outsourced. Every 1$ in coffee imported to the US ends up creating an estimated 43$ in value here at home.

\- Consumers spend more than $300M on coffee products every day, nearly $110B per year

Nearly all U.S. coffee consumptions rely on coffee beans grown by farmers in the tropical regions, the US produces less than 1% of all coffee consumed domestically, with farmers in Hawaii and Puerto Rico growing coffee in America.

Once imported, green coffee beans are transported, warehoused, processed, roasted, prepared, and distributed by coffee businesses in America that are pillars of economic activity and ensure America has a steady supply of its favorite beverage (other than tap water).",1,1745616405.0,u_Adronitis_Archive,0,1.0,False

Early December 2024 I had what the doctor said was a panic attack. I was driving, had to pull over because I began almost passing out. It was like someone was choking me, almost like my neck being squeezed on both sides then my heart just started racing like crazy. Paramedics checked me out, everyone ok just heart rate and blood pressure up, went back down after relaxing and talking. Felt like garbage for days and days. Went to the doctor was diagnosed with anxiety\panic disorder. Doctor said let’s check your thyroid just in case. TSH was 23.800, T4 was 0.63. Was told I have hypothyroidism and was put on 200mcg of Levo. The first week on it, I literally thought I was dying. Heart racing, shivers, body ached, I was just terrified of everything and anything. Couldn’t go out, and I have 3 kids. 5,3 and 9 months so I was about 5 months post partum when this started. Started feeling okish but still was having those heart rate and blood pressure spikes. 6 weeks later for blood test, TSH was 0.830. Was kept on 200mcg, 6 weeks after that TSH was 0.070. Was lowered down to 150mcg of levo, same thing TSH was 0.980, then again TSH goes to 0.210 then taken down to 137mcg, and yet again I’ve been lowered down to 125mcg levo.
My blood pressure levels did get better down to a 120/88 from 130s

It seems my levels go slightly normal, then back into higher and this has been the cycle.
I also had my iron checked in February and my level was 17! So I’m on iron supplements. 

But I have been struggling with severe anxiety and health anxiety. It’s like I can’t break this mental cycle. I’ve been going for walks, eating better, cutting out gluten. Taking Vitamin D, Magnesium, Vitamin C. I even cut out coffee since January because I was worried about the blood pressure. 😭 But I’m starting to think something is really wrong. I’m just miserable.

I had an endoscopy a couple years ago and they discovered quite a bit (around 100) small benign polyps. I have been on nexium for about 12 years, with the last 4 years being on 40mg versus 20mg. 

When speaking with the GI I asked about diet and it was so restrictive I thought there’s no way anyone could do it.

No caffeine. No chocolate. No dairy. No spicy. Literally everything I enjoy in life lol. (Foodie here)

I eat pretty healthy albeit having a sweet tooth and having one cup of coffee in the morning.

I know my polyps are most likely caused by PPIs, however at the amount I have could this be causing me more discomfort or is it purely the reflux?

If I miss one dose I can barely eat or drink anything it’s so bad. Even some days with my meds I have breakthrough reflux and heartburn. 

Thanks for any tips or even others who have similar symptoms, I would love to hear your thoughts.

I’m 44 and moved to Albuquerque back in 2020. I’m looking to meet some like-minded folks around my age who are into some of the same hobbies — or maybe can introduce me to something new.

A little about me:
	•	I’m into music, mostly from my generation. I casually play guitar and bass, and I’ve always wanted to learn drums someday.
	•	I enjoy comics and the comic world — I’m not super deep into it, just into the stuff I like and always happy to chat about it.
	•	I like hiking and camping and am looking to get back into it soon.
	•	I enjoy drawing and painting as a way to relax and decompress.
	•	I play video games (mostly solo stuff) but would be open to learning more about online gaming.
	•	I enjoy reading, though I don’t do it as much as I’d like. Open to recommendations or maybe even a casual book hangout.
	•	I’m also down to try out new hobbies and interests.

Not being from Albuquerque originally, I’d really like to meet some good people and expand my circle. Whether it’s for hanging out, hiking, jamming, talking about comics, gaming, or just grabbing a coffee — I’m down to connect.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to message or comment!

1k7w2kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/1k7w2kt/most_of_us_are_likely_not_getting_enough/,"Most of us are likely not getting enough magnesium, and dark chocolate and cacao are not just good sources, they are VERY good sources of magnesium.","I am an independent researcher that has committed to scientifically justifying eating chocolate frequently, if not everyday. I know that everyone, to some degree, has heard in the news or media of chocolate and cacao having health benefits, but I intend to get into the nitty gritty into the hows and whys. But also investigating the topics that most chocolatiers would rather not discuss, such as heavy metals and unethical labor. With that being said, I’d like to share with you all the first reason that I add to my list of chocolate eating excuses. 

Most of us are likely not getting enough magnesium in our diets to be optimally healthy, and dark chocolate and cacao are not just good sources, they are *very* good sources of magnesium. 

Magnesium is a foundational mineral needed for over 300 processes in your body, and not getting enough can contribute to just about every disease that you can imagine from Alzheimer's to osteoporosis. 

That is why It’s unfortunate that an overwhelming amount of people around the world are not getting enough of it. In the U.S. I was able to find several publications stating that around half of people from the early 2000’s to 2016 weren’t getting enough magnesium. ^(1) ^(2) ^(3) But it’s not an issue exclusive to the United States, it’s a rather worldwide problem. ^(4) ^(5) ^(6) ^(7)

In addition, throughout the years there have been several experts who have stated that they actually disagree with the conventional RDA set by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) ^(5,) and have advocated to set the bar even higher. Notably, Dr. Shari Lieberman And Dr. Andrea Rosanoff.

Dr. Shari Lieberman , PhD in clinical nutrition and exercise physiology and certified nutrition specialist was a prominent nutrition scientist and author up until she passed away in 2010 due to breast cancer. She specialized in vitamins, minerals, and integrative health and advocated for what she believed was Optimal Daily Intake (ODI) for nutrients that were starkly different than the conventional RDA’s established by the FNB.  She suggested 500-750 mg of magnesium per day for most individuals for optimal health. ^(6)

Dr. Andrea Rosanoff is a nutritional biologist with a PhD in nutrition, and is one of, if not the world’s leading expert in magnesium research, focusing on its role in human health. She is also concerned with the fact that an overwhelming amount of people aren’t getting enough magnesium, and is similarly advocating for change in the conventional RDA’s for magnesium. Going as far as to say that 800+ mg of magnesium could be best for those with high blood pressure, blood glucose, or cholesterol. ^(8) 

The fact that we aren’t getting enough of the conventional RDA of magnesium is concerning enough, but if the ideal intakes are indeed more like Dr. Shari Lieberman’s and Dr. Andrea Rosanoff’s recommendations then the issue is much more grave than we think as visualized by [table 1](https://imgur.com/a/1CWYq17).

Now you could try to supplement, but that has its own caveats and issues because not every magnesium supplement is the same quality as others. And even then, there is evidence that supplemental magnesium is not the same nor as effective as dietary magnesium. ^(9) This is not exclusive to magnesium, but a rather constant theme in the nutritional literature time and time again is that supplemental nutrients do not necessarily give the same benefit as dietary nutrients. ^(10) ^(11) ^(12)

Yes, I’m sure that supplements may be a viable intervention for some people, but it doesn’t change the fact that both deficient and non deficient people should prioritize getting their nutrients from food.

So the logical thing is to eat your magnesium. Looking on the NIH website ^(13), you can see a table of some of the top foods that contain magnesium for every serving, but they did not mention cacao or dark chocolate. So I took the liberty of adding it for [them](https://imgur.com/a/Iqq0DVs). \*

Cacao powder has ton of magnesium in it, with 100 grams providing up to 499 mg of magnesium, which is  119-125% of the RDA established by the FNB. ^(14 15)  Now obviously, no one is going to straight up eat 100 grams of cacao powder and you really shouldn’t aim to get all of your dietary magnesium from cacao anyway. Too much of anything can be a bad thing. And it is no different with chocolate (unfortunately). But the reason it's significant is because, gram for gram, cacao is more mineral dense than most other magnesium rich foods. While not the number one spot, cacao and dark chocolate would rank very high on the table they provided.

But what makes cacao stand out from other magnesium sources, is that it also has a ton of complementary nutrients, antioxidants, and polyphenols, on top of being very magnesium dense. The polyphenols and other nutrients present in cacao might help in the absorption of its magnesium, making it potentially more bioavailable than other magnesium foods, even those that have more magnesium by sheer number. Now to be clear, this is an extrapolation, I wasn’t able to find any direct studies comparing magnesium bioavailability in cacao to other foods. But even if this does not turn out to be necessarily true, the presence of these nutrients and polyphenols have their own list of benefits that I'll cover in a future post. The nutrient profile between cacao and the other foods is generally comparable, except for the polyphenol content.  Cacao doesn't just have a higher presence of polyphenols, it has a dramatically higher presence of polyphenols. For reference, the top 2 foods that surpass cacao are chia seeds and pumpkin seeds which have  3.5 mg GAE/g and 9.8 mg GAE/g of polyphenols respectfully.^(16 17) Whereas cacao can have up to 56 mg GAE/g (This is assuming the highest polyphenol content I was able to find for each of these foods). ^(18)

With that I conclude that cacao is not just a good source to get your magnesium from, it is a very good source to consider. And establish my first scientifically justified reason as to why we should eat chocolate frequently, if not everyday.

1k7w27f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k7w27f/you_will_get_through_this_i_promise/,You will get through this. I promise.,"Hey guys,

Back in December, I posted about the heartbreak I was going through when my ex broke up with me. I couldn’t understand how anyone could ever get over a love that felt so deep, so real. It felt like the world had ended, like the ache in my chest would never fade. I honestly couldn’t imagine life without that constant pain. I felt like I was drowning in it, and I thought it would always be a part of me.

But I promise you, it does get better. You have to feel it all; the rawness, the anger, the sadness, the heartbreak and god PLEASE don’t try to run from it, because it will find you no matter what. Let yourself feel every single emotion, because that’s how you’ll heal. It’s messy, it’s ugly, but it’s also where the magic happens.

You will stop crying. You’ll wake up one day and realise you haven’t thought about them in hours. Slowly, you’ll forget how they smelled, how their laugh sounded, how their voice could soothe or shatter your heart. You’ll remember pieces of yourself you thought you lost forever. You’ll feel love again REAL real love, love that’s not tied to pain. And ou’ll remember who you were before the hurt took over.

You will find people who will light you up in ways your ex never did. People who you may have walked past at the office in work, on the street, in your fave coffee shop, at the gym. People you never would have met if you stayed stuck in the past. You will find new connections, new friendships, new joy in places you never expected. You will be yourself again. Better even.

I promise you, even if it feels impossible right now, you will be fine. You are stronger than you think. The pain will eventually fade, and the person you become through it all will be someone even more amazing than you were before. So hold on, trust the process, and know that the best version of yourself is waiting on the other side of this.

Sending so much love to all of you going through this. You’ve got this, you will bloom.

Some notes:

* Jona seems to be enjoying the challenge of the injuries.  Preparations, tactical models, etc.  He really appreciates the players for their flexibility and that they are getting points even if they are far away from the level they want, or had during the preseason.
* Hatchy has been doing well, and barring a setback she probably plays.
* Casey is doing well, training with Britt.  They will be available soon.  Maybe next week.
* Challenge of building up against Gotham's intense pressing style.  Jona says Gotham doesn't like to defend in mid or low block, they are pressing and always trying to jam \[me: generally think he distinguishes between the press (pressuring players by running at them) and the jam (getting a touch on the ball because the player is trapped).  Jona says they are getting important chances in games due to their success at doing it.  Said they need to identify the spaces left open, and this will be a big challenge as Gotham is probably the best team in the league at it.
* He doesn't know anything about Trin's timelines.  She is being managed by the doctors, and he will try to support her.  \[me: losing one of the best players in the world impacts him the most in that he needs to try to compensate with focus on the available players.  Coaches sometimes sound weird to us when they say they are focused on the available players, but they really think they need to support players who have big shoes to fill.\]
* He is asked about the D2 league.  Aside from some stuff about liking young players energy, and the tougher league making it harder to sub them in compared to Spain, he doesn't seem to really track enough with what that league will mean to his job to answer what the reporter is asking effectively.  The reporter probably needed to call it an academy team to translate to his experience.
* He did say that he doesn't think he gives playing opportunities, but rather provides time to players who earn it.  Name checks Kate, Croix, Hal, and Chloe for earning their minutes.  He says young players bring energy to training and push the older players.
* He says they are changing how they are attacking and defending every game and even within games, using different shapes, which makes it very hard for teams to analyze what they are doing. \[me: he does seem to have some genuine enjoyment.  He had to hear the naysayers at his hiring that he couldn't just come ""be Barca"" and win in the NWSL.  Barca has a way of playing, and they execute it incredibly well, and they raise through their academy in a way that no NWSL roster could be built.  He is blazing a trail towards showing the ability of NWSL players to play at a higher level of tactical sophistication - and some of the coaching staffs were the problem.\]

Esme:

* \[me: Always fun to listen to Esme, she is such a character.\]
* Commiserates with Jason over allergies.
* \[me: can hear the Man City in her when she talks about playing out the back\]  She notes that you have to recognize the patterns in the press.  She says that Gotham tends to jump straight away to which ever center back a goal kick is played to and then they lock onto the players in the holding midfield.  Knowing that, it is about exploiting the spaces they leave behind the first pressing line, so trying to find players in the pockets \[me: generally means space between the opposing midfield line and the back line usually between the center back and the full back\] or in behind \[me: go over the back line, usually in the wider spaces where you can create 1v1 duels with their full backs for the ball in deep\].  She says you really just need to read what they leave.  
* \[me: I wonder whether Tara at RB might be a thing this week, Rebe and Esme are really strong in this skill.  We saw Rebe put Tara in behind in that training video.  Last time against Gotham they put Trin and Paige out on the right side together to really push that wide space.  Send our former USC forward at the UCLA rookie back.  They can put Nealy and Bruninha doubling Rose, and I like Rose to come out with the ball.\]
* She says that the injury adversity has really brought the team together, and they believe that any of their healthy players can take on any team in the league.  She says she thinks ugly games like Orlando are really satisfying knowing how frustrating they are for the other team.
* Guarding Esther.  She says that Esther is really intelligent, and she likes to drop short in the build up to get involved and linking to get their wingers running in behind. \[me: leaving the Spirit back line and getting closer to the midfield to receive passes and move them to others moving up the field (linking).\]  She says that Esther is so smart in and around the box with her movements, always trying to get to the defender's back shoulder and in their blind spots, so she can pop out an receive.  Esme says the key is to lock on to her, make physical contact to know where she is and then attacking the ball to prevent clean contact.  Esme also says that if they can get tight out wide to limit the crosses, that stops Esther's attack the source.  \[me: it is always fun to watch goofy and fun Esme lock in and start talking *football* like the Man City academy grad she is.\]
* She says they have gotten used to adapting training to the injury realities, and those adaptations seem to help them and builds confidence changing formations and being versatile.  She thinks they have a bunch of players capable of playing a couple of different roles to a high level.
* Travel has been preventing TV movie nights.  She said they were all a bit speechless after their last one (The Substance).  They have started a ""controversy club"" to discuss topics over coffee.  
* She is thrilled about her Jaguars drafting Travis Hunter.  She said she was screaming when they traded up, and Kate who lives three floors above her messaged her to see what was going on.

Well, that was longer than I thought it would be... Pairing Esme with Jona is pretty helpful, especially given Man City and Barca are of the same tree.  I wish they had asked her the academy question.  Pretty sure she would have had something interesting to say.",13,1745615284.0,washingtonspirit,5,1.0,False

She runs the entire house. Everyone else,  my father&  siblings either enable her or stay silent because it’s easier than standing up to her.

She controls everything. 

When I’m allowed to sleep, shower, study or go out . When I’m allowed to speak and my opinions. 

Today she told me I’m not allowed to sit with them anymore as punishment for wanting buy a dress she didn’t choose. 

The abuse got worse after I met  my boyfriend because she can’t control as much when he helps me be less financially controlled by her. 

My bf is  currently on a mission, with only 5–10 minutes of communication a day. After being concerned about not hearing from him for 2 days, My mom lied to me and tried to convince me he might have been bombed , just to mentally break me.

She won’t allow me to marry him because of his ethnicity and because it would mean I’d finally be free.

My sister and I used to be close. We always talked about how our mom wanted to turn us against each other because she couldn’t control us when we were united.
But the moment I became less useful to her, she chose comfort. Now she’s the golden child — while I’m isolated, punished, and ignored.

We’re both studying for Step 2 CK. She gets free coffee every day and full support.
I pay for mine out of a tiny allowance and some days I can’t even afford it. Normally, my boyfriend covers all my expenses, but he’s not here now and my mom knows that too.

We share a room. She messes with my sleep.
And my mom has hit me during arguments. No one steps in. No one says a word.

Every day feels like psychological warfare. I’m doing everything I can just to survive it and get through this exam.
But it’s getting harder and harder.
I feel like I’m being punished for trying to build a life that doesn’t revolve around her.

If you’ve lived through this kind of control, how did you survive the final stretch before freedom?",2,1745614985.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1k7vqw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k7vqw7/should_you_buy_the_huggiegems_magnetic_spice_rack/,Should You Buy the HuggieGems Magnetic Spice Rack Review for Kitchen Organization?,"Testing out everyday items in my kitchen-space lab, the HuggieGems 13 Magnetic Spice Storage Rack Organizer quickly became a standout. This collapsible four-pack of sleek black racks boldly claims its place as a modern kitchen hero, one that's magnetic (quite literally) in its functionality. Boasting a rustproof, metal construction and compact dimensions of 11.8""D x 4.33""W x 4.33""H, I knew this was going to be an interesting one. As someone who thrives on clutter-free counters and maximized storage potential, these racks were put to the test in my cramped space, and I'll tell you all about my findings.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, this thing had me intrigued. The black finish is elegant and fits seamlessly with the theme of my kitchen. The fact that no assembly is required saves time and energy (which my coffee-deprived mornings dearly appreciate). Their collapsible design made them versatile enough to rearrange as needed—not to mention these shelves hold an impressive 50 pounds! Mounting them to my refrigerator seemed effortless, and the magnets gripped like they were clinging for dear life. Whether holding weighty glass spice jars or lightweight seasoning packets, these racks stood strong without any wobbling or slipping.

**Ease of Use and Installation**

For someone who usually avoids tools like they're an ancient curse, installing these was a dream. No drills, no screws, no fuss—just align the rack on your fridge or oven's side, and it's good to go. I particularly loved how easy it was to reposition them when I felt the arrangement needed tweaking. Adjusting their placement took seconds, and they didn’t leave a scratch on my appliances (major win there). My kids even took a liking to sliding them around like magnetic puzzles.

**Pluses**

- Rustproof material ensures durability.  
- Heavy-duty magnets keep them secure.  
- Perfect for tiny kitchens with limited counter space.  
- Easy to adjust and relocate even on a whim.

**Drawbacks**

While the racks excelled in most areas, there are a few minor bumps worth mentioning. They're best suited for straight, smooth surfaces; if your fridge has a curved design, their grip might not be as secure. Also, while the capacity is impressive, larger spice containers (think oversized Costco jars) don’t fit snugly unless arranged really carefully. That's not exactly a dealbreaker, but it's something to consider depending on your pantry situation.

- Not ideal for refrigerators with curved surfaces.  
- Might struggle to house larger, bulkier spice containers.

**Other Options**

In my quest for optimal kitchen organization, I've tried my fair share of magnetic racks. Some alternatives included cheaper, flimsy versions that couldn't hold even a few jars without sliding down. Others, like a bamboo wood variant with adhesive backing, created a permanent setup—nice but not flexible. Compared to these, the HuggieGems model offered unparalleled adjustability, strength, and ease of use. Sure, there are stainless steel options out there that might outshine in look, but few provide that perfect combo of functionality and practicality like this product does.

**Smart Spending**

For anyone juggling a tight budget yet looking for a solution that combines durability and functionality, this product feels like a steal. Without dropping a fortune on custom cabinetry or shelf units, you're instantly upgrading your storage potential. While it might not have stainless steel's aesthetic flair, its performance, portability, and overall utility make it worthwhile.

1k7vo7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1k7vo7b/doctor_said_im_healthy/,Doctor said I’m healthy,"I’m 22 almost 23, I weigh at the moment 195 lb (was 205 lb April 6th) I’m also 5’4 and my weight is starting to negatively affect my life. I struggle to go on hikes because of how out of breath I get, I struggle to get literally anything physical done. Almost all of my weight is on my thighs so it looks incredibly weird and unnatural. I’ve been going to my doctor regarding my weight since I was probably 8, I was always chubby. It just never had affected my life.

I’ve been yo-yo dieting for a while, and honestly I think a dietitian might actually be able to help me (and they’re covered IF my doctor says I need them!)

She gets a bunch of tests done and says I’m actually very healthy. That I’ve just always been a big girl and that weight is fine for my body. I don’t FEEL fine. I’ve tried to explaining that to her but… nothing.

Now, I try to get physical activity in everyday but I do struggle to. I’ll get 15-20k steps one day and then won’t get over 5k per day for the next… 3 days. I go to the gym once a week, sometimes twice. I don’t count calories because I have gotten into some really nasty mindsets when I count them, but I generally have food like…

Greek yogurt bowl for breakfast:
Plain Greek yogurt (3/4 cup)
Granola (1/4 cup)
Dark chocolate square 

Medium iced coffee with oat milk & light sweetener

And generally… whatever I have home for dinner. Sometimes it’s cod and veggies, sometimes is a sausage and veggies, sometimes it’s another yogurt bowl and two boiled eggs, sometimes it’s rice and chicken, sometimes it’s chicken and cucumber, sometimes it’s a lettuce wrapped burger or a salad w/o dressing.

I’ve been documenting my food intake on TT for advice too! (Sometimes I get told to eat less, sometimes more.)

I also eat whatever I want on the weekends bcuz it’s the only way I stop myself from yo-yo dieting. I HAVE lost weight, the issue is I don’t think I can maintain this lifestyle in the long run and I do want to see a dietitian for help. I can’t afford one.

I don’t know if I’m on the right path and honestly my family isn’t very supportive of me losing weight either. Like they’re supportive but the second I eat out they tell me I lost progress and should just give up.

I want to lose weight the healthy way, and I have no idea if I’m doing it right. My partner tells me I eat too little, my mom tells me I eat too much, my friends tell me I just need to work out more (I need time & honestly energy? For example I went to the gym today but wasn’t able to do anything more than 20 mins of cardio, I got incredibly dizzy.)

I am anemic and have been taking my 300mg iron pills every day since I was 10, I am still as anemic as I was back then. 

I will say, I do feel like I’m not struggling with brain fog anymore and I don’t know if that’s my diet or just magic? And I do have PCOS.

Reality once again folded as Alex leapt into the waiting Portal to hopefully get back to Nino’s. Something squelched and gave him a wet willy as his body undulated and popped all over in a not unpleasant way. A monolith of giant black stone gave him the creeps and didn’t move. It just felt off. While he could tell that most of the weird shit he saw while flying through the portal was harmless, the stone felt more real and somehow frightening. Singing toothbrushes surrounded him like a school of fish. He was pretty sure he saw a giant list of people’s social security numbers. Then the familiar pop and he was in the real world again.

He landed onto the tile of Nino’s back kitchen while the espresso machine whirred and face planted into a bag of flour. As always, the smells hit first. Garlic and yeast and oregano and sauce. Alex gasped and spat out a wad of flour as Nina stirred the sauce behind him. He saw that she floated two feet off the group and pulled dough straight from the air.

“Ah,” she said without turning around from her prep. “Good timing, Alex. Lunch rush soon. Good job on the delivery.” Finally she turned and smiled at him while giving the dough a smack that spun it into a perfect disc above her head.

Alex staggered upright. It was at that moment he realized how tired he was. Running through the Dungeon and dealing with Britanii had stretched his Core. He was pretty sure he didn’t have anything left to give in the way of active Skills like \[Phantom Step\]. And now Nina was telling him the lunch rush was just about to start.

“No, we don’t have a facking ‘hot honey’!” Nino yelled from the front at some poor customer. Alex couldn’t see him, but he imagined Nino waving a fat finger at the requestor. “You take your hot honey and shov–,”

“Lunch rush? I…don’t know if I can keep doing that, Nina,” he shared with her. He did however pull out the velvet pouch of tips from Mistress Snu while Nina sniffed. Sauce flowed from the gurgling pot and spread itself on the pizza while Nina flicked cheese from her fingers. Into the eclectic grill it floated on its own accord. Alex spotted the multiple pies already crisping nicely and his stomach rumbled..

“You did good for first delivery. Even if to that *putana*,” Nina walked over to an ancient fridge and rummaged around a wall of margarine containers. “But we have more to do. Put tips over there,” she threw her head to the side and Alex spotted a standard metal locker at the back of the kitchen. There also appeared to be another door. Alex tossed his tip from Snu into the locker and turned back around. The sight made his eyebrows rise.

Nina was already holding a steaming bowl of creamy ravioli. Parmigiano, butter, and cream wafted and filled his nostrils. The ravioli looked perfectly cooked and was flecked with parsley and cracked pepper. They even looked handmade. Behind Nina, a tiny wooden stool had appeared as well. It sat exactly one and had legs that looked suspiciously like they used to belong to a horse. Nino continued to argue from the front, but this time with a different sounding customer.

“Sit,” Nina said firmly. “Eat. It fix you right up. Make you strong. You too skinny. We no want you fat, but this is too much.” Alex just blinked at her. Where the hell did she keep pulling these meals from? Nina’s eyes squinted and something behind him shoved. An insistent push guided him and he plopped down onto the stool with a grunt. “This help. You have many deliveries to make. But eat first.”

The moment he sat down and accepted the bowl, a spoon appeared in his hand. He wasn’t sure how. Maybe it had always been there? He took a single bite and his eyes widened.

The creamy seasoned ricotta inside was soft inside the firm but perfectly cooked pasta. The butter cream sauce was decadent and slightly nutty. The cracked pepper hit just right. The parm was so perfectly sharp that stars flared in his eyes and it rewrote traumatic memories. Alex moaned “Holy shit,” with stuffed cheeks. “What did you do to these?”

Nina just hummed and stirred her sauce while floating. Each bite sent waves of warmth through his body. More importantly, Alex noticed that the food sent warmth to his Core. With every forkful something deep inside recharged like a battery. That was decidedly not normal. Everyone knew that you had to let your Core rest and fix itself after straining it. His leg cramps loosened and his headache he didn’t know he had vanished. As he finished the bowl of amazing ravioli and came to his senses, he could feel it. It wasn’t dramatic and there weren't any notifications but…

*Yep. That fucking ravioli just filled and autohealed my Core. Ho boy. I did hit the jackpot.*

Yeah, it wasn’t just full. It kind of felt like it was overflowing. Ready to cast and run and throw \[Phantom Step\]s through the whole damn city. “I didn’t even get a notification…my Core just filled.”

Nina turned and smiled at him. “Good food doesn’t need to brag. It's just good.”

“I feel like I could deliver a hundred pizzas,” he said and Nina laughed. The dirty bowl vanished out of his hands and he heard the clatter of it in the half full soapy sink to the side.

“Mmm not that many orders. But a lot.. Tomorrow, I make something special. Dessert. Just make it through day one. No big Dungeon rest of day, I don’t think. They usually order by now.”

Alex jumped to his feet. He had been satisfied and happy with his single delivery mostly due to how much it took out of him. But if Nina could just zip his Core better with her delicious food, then he would keep running pizzas until he literally collapsed. The magic had to run out eventually. Right? The promise of more delivery payment and tips made him eager to get moving again. Add in the over abundance of energy and he was primed to run the city again.

“I’m ready. Give me another order.” He said to Nina with his underdeveloped chest pushed out.

Nina snapped her fingers. A pizza box materialized in front of him and he snatched it just as the notification hit.

**\[A New Job has been assigned by your Employer - Nino’s Pizza\]**

**\[Deliver the Pizza to the Customer - Time Remaining - 41:22\]**

**\[50 Credit Reward for Completion, along any and all tips from Customers\]**

**\[Customer: Delta Phi Brews - Alchemy Fraternity and Acapella Group\]**

“Don’t worry about time. These much easier than Dungeon.” Nina waved as the espresso machine roared to life again. Alex didn’t wait. He just ran toward the Portal and vanished to deliver some fresh pies.

Alex reappeared in the middle of a college street lined with crumbling mansions that smelled like alcohol. A frat house blared arcane dubstep and the dirt lawn was full of shirtless dudes doing keg stands and chugging smoking potions. A young student with body mods to look like a satyr wearing reflective shades and a freshly healing burn brand shouted, “PIZZA’S HERE BROS!” while paying him. The sac of tips Alex got felt like it might be golden teeth, but he would check later.

The next Delivery was a corporate high rise. Everyone moved exactly the same, never blinked, and wore suits enchanted to change color based on their productivity KPIs. The receptionist was a floating crystal that sounded dejected at her lack of mouth to taste. “Please deliver to Floor 42. The Quarterly sacrifice is just about to end and they will be hungry,” she said. The elevator was quick, and Alex whizzed by a man warming the coffee pot with a fireball. The pizza was whisked away, he was paid, but only received 12 Credits as a tip and a “We value promptness.” sticky note.

Next he appeared in a YMCA gym where a group of pimply, barely adult Adventurers gathered around a smokeless campfire. One was trying too hard to impress the others and dual wielded kebab pokers. He thought he was somewhere on the west side of the city, near the now defunct airport. They did pay up and give him a tiny glowing Monster core as a tip though. Pretty nice considering Alex spotted their tattered looking tents they obviously slept in. Probably street rats trying to get out of poverty, just like he had.

Alex blinked after a particularly uncomfortable Portal jump. The stone had been there again. The sunny atrium he stood in smelled like ointment and floral perfume. The building was sleek and clean and quiet.“Is that the pizza boy?” a voice called, followed by the vrrr of an enchanted walker. An elderly woman who looked about 200 walked over to him. She wore a “I survived the Chippendales,” t-shirt and gave him a once over.

Alex presented the box. “Extra cheese and garlic. Delivery for the West Wing?”

“Yes, yes, they’re paying Battle Bingo. You know the one where the winner gets to cast a Skill on someone? It’s a real mess in there.”

Before he could respond, three more seniors appeared. One with a floating IV bag, one in a mech chair that was painted like a car, and another who straight up was just an animated corpse. Alex found himself smiling as they gave him a knitted sweater as a tip. One thing post System society had done right was care for the elderly. The System didn’t make anyone immortal and people still aged. They just aged a lot more gracefully. When your resident old person could zap you with Healing Skills and rich Adventurers had tons of Credits to spare, the elderly lived far better now than in the before times.

He then ducked into a smoky speakeasy run by a floating skull. Off duty chunky guardsmen lounged on cushioned floors. They smoked something out of a glowing hookah. A trained troll in a bathrobe and a banshee wearing an Adidas tracksuit accepted the pizza. They paid too and handed Alex a potion labeled “Only Use when Emotionally Ready”. He wasn’t sure what that meant but pocketed it anyway. Relics and potions were as good as money.

One smaller bowl of ravioli and a delivery later, Alex landed in the Botanical Gardens. According to Alex’s limited knowledge of the before System time, they were extremely popular in Toronto for school kids, the elderly, and tourists to visit and admire. Now they were overrun by a war mongering Garden Gnome horde. Hundreds of the chipped gnomes in tiny armor waved spears and garden tools. “Pizza Peace Accord!” shouted a particularly cracked gnome leader from atop a wicker chair. They held up a slice and passed it to what Alex thought might be their shaman. Alex didn’t wait to see what happened next, and didn’t think the electrified Opal he got for a tip would amount to anything worthwhile.

By the time the last delivery stopped for the day, Alex dropped back into Nino’s. He was panting, sweaty, and exhausted. But his locker of tips was overflowing and he had made a killing.

**\[CREDITS: 552\]**

Over 400 credits in a single day. Plus all the loot that he had gathered. He hadn’t had time to sort through it and hopefully Mary would know more about the values and their sellability. Throughout the day, he had decided he would keep the good stuff he could use, and sell the expensive and useless. The brightside was that he was richer and his Core was still humming. Tomorrow if he had time, he could even pay Jemin back.

The Portal shut down and Nino and Nina were scrubbing pots and pans by hand. A little radio played Italian love songs and they cleaned silently together. They probably could have used magic, and Alex felt like he was intruding on an intimate moment. In between his deliveries, he had heard Nino’s anger flaring at customers interspersed with booming laughter. Nina had done whatever it was Nina did with food Skills.

Nino wiped his hands on a dish towel and nodded at Alex. “Good job today,” he said simply. “That was good normal day. You did well, Alex.”

*That was a normal day?*

“Tomorrow is Saturday,” Nino continued while popping his back. “We start later. Two PM. Go until late night. People want pizza when star out, you know? Get good night sleep tonight. Tomorrow the creepy customers order. Need wit about you.”

Alex looked around the kitchen. The espresso machine was silent and the Portal had closed with a zipper noise. There wasn’t a speck of flour anywhere. He thought about asking where they slept. Did they sleep? He didn’t see any stairs. There was that back door…did that go somewhere else? He thought better of asking. Nina finished her last dish and floated back to the ground to grin at him.

Nino handed him a small burlap bag with a snap of his fingers. “For tip.” It weighed a lot more than it should. Turning, he saw the locker was empty.

*Did he just…? Yup he did.*

“Good night Alex,” Nina said and handed him over a warm tupperware container.

“Oh no, you don’t–,”

“Ah, shaddap. It’s just chicken parmesan. Share with friend,” she swatted at him. Nino walked him to the front of the shop and Nina called after him. “Tomorrow, I make special dessert. You see how good is.”

As Alex was approaching the front door, he spotted something in the window. There was a new hanging plant hanging there. A simple little pot hung by twine. Looked like a healthy ivy plant with a little blue flower.

“Was that there before?”

Nino looked and smiled around the cigarette he now puffed on. “Oh. Yeah, no. When Shop get better, we can add thing. Little at time. Today Alex, you made it better. Just a little. But better.” He clapped Alex on the back with a little too much strength and pushed Alex out of the door. “Tomorrow, 2 o’clock.”

Alex stepped out into the noise and night time summer heat of Kensington Market. He made his way to his beat up car and slung the bag of tips into the passenger seat. It gave an extremely satisfying thunk that told him of the riches he earned today. Hopefully Mary was still up. He could use her help cataloguing what he’d got. He was also pretty sure that Emilio would love the electrified Opal the gnomes had given him. The cat always had been weirdly into shiny things. Maybe he’d even text Snu. Alex smiled to himself and started the car and wasn’t even the bit surprised when it turned over on the first try. Tomorrow, he’d pay Jemin back, be that much richer, and do it all again. He had to admit, his new job was fun, and he could only imagine the gains he would get. He hadn’t leveled up yet, but maybe over night his Core would acclimate to the progress of the Skills he had used.

*So far? Not too bad.* He turned up his favorite Green Day song and drove home.

1k7vm3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k7vm3h/issues_with_pooping/,Issues with pooping,"So it dawned on me recently that something I'm used to treat as reality of life possibly could be a problem.

I'm M35, 176 cm, 94 kg (Google converts me to 5 feet 9 19⁄64 inches and 207.234526 lbs), I take following meds:
Vortioxetine 20 mg
Venlafaxine 225 mg
Lamotrigine 75 mg
Mirtazapine 30 mg

Yes, I'm doing as great as it looks like. But the issue I wanted to talk about is for me much harder than talking about my mental health, because, and I am ashamed that it is so shameful for me, I know it shouldn't, so it is about pooping.

Since I remember (which is not much, I have rather general knowledge of my past) I had problems with tummy aches and loose stools. I eat almost only homemade food, and since ~10 years mostly vegetarian (my wife does not eat meat and I am too lazy to prepare two different meals, and hey, vege stuff is tasty).

My typical day in terms of food and beverage would be
1) 2 sandwiches with cheese and coffee with lactose-free milk (I do not know anything about me being lactose intolerant, but my wife prefers it)
2) banana & coffee
3) risotto with zucchini & whatever vegetables were at store
4) something sweet or a handful of nuts & tea
5) more tea
6) 2 sandwiches with cheese again

I also drink a lot of water, I always have someon my desk, I've got a big filtering thing in the kitchen and Jesus Christ how do people not drink water.

What I noticed is:
1) when I am stressed even more than usual, it tends to get worse
2) when I travel and eat whatever, some fast food, or when I visit my grandma and eat basically meat, fat and potatoes it tends to get better

That does not make any sense to me. How can I troubleshoot this without getting atherosclerosis.",1,1745614480.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1k7vlj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1k7vlj1/how_to_know_if_they_like_you_back_or_if_its_worth/,How to know if they like you back or if it's worth it,"I recently made a [blog entry](https://www.inthenowlifestyle.com/blogs/attract-what-matters/crush-or-confusion-how-to-know-if-someone-likes-you-back) that I wanted to specifically distill down for this group, since I think there's SO many scenarios where you'll wonder ""What if"", which can be incredibly unhelpful in your dating/seduction journey. Here are, in my opinion, the only 7x signs you'll need to determine whether they ""like you back"" (**If you're not going to read them all....then just skip to #4...it's the MOST important**):

**1) They Make Time For You Consistently**

Effort is attractive. Consistency is revealing.

* Do they reply quickly (or mirror your cadence)…not just at 11pm on a Thursday?
* Do they initiate plans (even if small)?
* May they don’t always *have* time...but do they *make* time?

This applies both online and IRL. Countless friends of mine have described to me people that they liked but that they were always ""busy."" When they stopped reaching out, their romantic interests never followed up. That will tell you everything you need to know. Period.

**2) They Mirror Your Energy**

Pay attention to how they respond:

* Do they text back with the same level of enthusiasm?
* Are they leaning in physically when you talk in person?

Mirroring is what happens when two people are attuned to each other and attraction is there. It's subconscious, it’s powerful, and it cannot be hidden. Period.

**3) They Ask About You (and Actually Listen)**

When someone likes you, they’re curious. They want to know:

* What excites you?
* What frustrates you?
* What was that story again about how you go hurt as a kid but .... (fill in the blanks)

They remember the little things. They bring them up later. They connect dots. Period.

**4) They Create Opportunities to See You - \*\*THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE - READ ME AT ALL COSTS\*\***

People who like you find reasons to be around you. **Period**. Let me say that one more time just so it's clear:

*People who like you find reasons to be around you.*

Sometimes, it’s:

* ""I’m grabbing coffee, want one?""
* Showing up to the same events you’re at
* Sending you that meme “just because”

These are micro-moments of effort that stack up fast. Related to #1 point 3...**people who like you will MAKE time to see you. Period.**

**5) They Flirt (and It’s More Than Just Compliments)**

Real flirting involves \*presence...\*not just praise.

* They challenge you playfully (women are excellent at this)
* They tease, but with warmth
* They hold eye contact just a beat longer than usual

This is not about being smooth like you see in movies. More info on this in my [book](https://www.inthenowlifestyle.com/pages/beyondthematch), if you want. Remember, women are (by default) better at flirting than the ""average man"" because they have worked and developed this skill almost their entire life. If they like you, they will flirt. Period.

**6) They Talk About the Future (Even Casually)**

If they say things like:

* “We should go there sometime”
* “You’d love this spot I know”
* “When it’s warmer (or colder), we should…”

Follow these breadcrumbs. These aren’t plans....yet. They’re seeds. And seeds only get planted when someone WANTS a future (even if it's small or short) with you. Period.

**7) They Show Vulnerability or Nervousness**

We think confidence = attraction. But sometimes, vulnerability is an even better sign.

People get nervous/vulnerable when they care. They might:

* Ramble
* Blush
* Check their appearance more than usual, etc...

Learn to appreciate these moments because they’re f\*cking beautiful. They mean YOU matter. Period.

**If You’re Still Unsure...Here’s the Hard Truth:**

Mixed signals *usually* mean one thing: **they’re not that interested.**

Let me repeat that in a different way so that it's crystal clear:

*If it feels inconsistent and like you’re always guessing or playing a game, like you’re doing 80% of the emotional labor...they’re probably not into it.*

And, in my opinion...even if they DO like you and they're just playing games. Is that really someone you want to dedicate your own time to? Is it REALLY worth it? Likely not...

But don’t let any of this discourage you. The goal of dating isn’t to ""get someone to like you"". It’s to connect with people who already do. That’s the mindset shift.

I’m taking the leap to move to a city from my hometown, a massive step in my life and hopefully the momentum I’ve been needed to get me out the rut I’ve been in for years now. However, I’ll have no friends. I’m wondering how I find the circle the aligns with what I’m looking for in life myself. Ideally I want to be around people I want to turn out like. But how does one go around finding these people. It seems to good to be true? I can’t shift the thought that the idea of chatting to someone in a coffee shop, networking event, bar etc will undoubtedly become a friend, that have many other friends that then become new friends. 

I’m sorry for my naivety but all I’ve ever known is my friends from school and my hometown so it’s so hard to wrap my head around. I’m a pretty talkative person, in the last 2.5 years I’ve been at the gym which has grew my confidence 10 fold which I’m so grateful for. So I feel talking to people won’t be a huge issue, more engaging in convo on my own, not with my friend around.

I’m looking to start a new career in the city also, something I’ve never done before as I’m still trying to find my passions. So maybe this will be a good way? The issue is I work remotely and it’s not like I’m going to uni so I’m not ‘forced’ to make new friends if you get my drift? It’s all me!

1k7vihr,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1k7vihr/partner_of_one_year_ended_our_relationship_after/,Partner of one year ended our relationship after before our anniversary when I got back from vacation.,"Hi all long post sorry, throwaway since my former partner knows my other Reddit.  I (31M) recently got back from a 10 day European vacation and was expecting to celebrate my one year anniversary with my partner Ashley (32F).  I had met Ashley through a dating app and she had told me she was poly.  I had told her that I have many situationships, I had not considered myself poly or ENM before she had told me about it and showed me some literature.  I realized what I had been doing was very similar to what the community entailed.  Ashley was in a heiarchy relationship with a primary, and I was a secondary which I was fine with.  That partner however became toxic around November and she ended things with that partner and declared herself solo poly.  Things were fine.  I spent about three months being her only partner.  
Slowly, she started to introduce more and more partners which I was fine with.  She used feeld and her work connections to go out on dates which was fine, I never considered myself the jealous type.
One day at a bar we ran into one of her partners who she had gone on two dates with previously, he was with another woman, and this made her shut down and ruin our night.  We had planned an overnight that night but instead she kicked me out saying she needed to process.  

I asked if she loved him more and she said no.  And I asked why did you let that ruin our night when you still had me? And she replied because I have very strong feelings for him too.  

This is where I started researching NRE.  I accepted it.  We moved on in a sense of ignoring and forgiving that night. 

That partner is named Bill (41M).  She also has Javier (42M) who is married who she sees twice a month.  She also has Zach (36M) who she has been seeing for about 5 years once a month.  She also has Dylan(41M) now who she met on feeld who’s married.  And she also randomly hit up a tinder fling from a year ago when she had nothing to do on a Friday night Tom (35M).

When I left for my Europe trip we promised to celebrate our anniversary and she replied can’t wait to jump your bones.  Our sex life was great.  I was excited to return.  When I got back, she replied do you want to get coffee and talk for a bit?  I said…I’m jet lagged, if this is a break up, please tell me why.

She replied saying she realized during my trip she didn’t miss me at all.  I suggested, is it possible that you having so many partners and seeing one 5/10 days that I was gone could be clouding your judgement on ending the relationship?  She said no, she no longer had romantic interest in me.

She really loves Bill but he says he’s monogamous and looking for a wife.  And Dylan is very new (only 2 dates).  I suppose I’m wondering how much of NRE or poly saturation or both had to do with this loss of romantic interest.  She sent me the I’m a great partner, I listen, I never did anything bad complimentary text.  When I told her I would like to return to a friends with benefits situation then instead of being an anchor or primary partner.  She said it wasn’t a good idea.  

In retrospect, she was a bad partner for not communicating.  We never RADAR.  She de escalated and pulled back without telling me what she was doing.  Our text conversations became much shorter and less interested.  She scrubbed our photos off social media and removed me as a constellation partner on feeld without telling me.  When I asked why didn’t she tell me, her reply was to test me to see if I would snap like her toxic partner from a year ago.  

We are currently in no contact, for 6 months, and she said don’t expect it but maybe we could have physical relations again if we’re both ready.  

I’m pretty much at a loss for how to feel.  Right now it’s numb, and anger at not being good enough?  All of her other partners make more money than me.  The only things she admired about we was a vibrant chipper personality, dancing, and good sex.  We both admitted we never had the same relationship after the bar incident and that’s when I accused her of possibly being an NRE junkie.  She denies it, but since she declared herself solopoly and wanted to detangle from me I could see she had changed from the moments where I was truly her primary/anchor.  This was my first poly relationship ever as well and she was the one who introduced me to everything.

1k7vi4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k7vi4j/i_encountered_a_stranger_while_working_at_a/,I encountered a Stranger while working at a desert Radio Station,"Back in my early twenties, I worked at a small radio station as the night time Radio host. The station itself was in a small town about an hour away from Las Vegas. “KRT3 87.4 FM” was our station name, not particularly noteworthy or catchy sounding, but our signal only really served the small towns surrounding one side of Vegas so it didn't need to stand out. Despite that fact, we had a small yet dedicated listener base and played mostly old Country songs. Some mornings when I'd go to the local diner for breakfast after my shift I'd talk with some of the old timers that liked to tune into my evening broadcast. They'd usually give me music suggestions or things to talk about for my next show. 

Needless to say, it was a great gig and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pay was okay, but it honestly wasn't a lot of work and it got me by while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. With that being said, there was one incident at the station that made me quit for good, and to this day I still have zero idea as to what actually happened that night.

For context: our station was a small brick building about a 30 minute drive outside of a very small town. All together the total population had to have been somewhere around six hundred people, so the community was very tight knit. We were situated just off the “main highway” and it wasn't unusual to see a few cars pass each night, but you never really saw any people whatsoever. The land across from the station was bare desert for miles and miles, and the same could be said for the surrounding land as well with the exclusion of a few small mountain/foothill ranges and a Native American reservation approximately 80 miles north of the station.

Now with the scene set, let me share with you one of the most horrifying nights I've had in my life.

It was late August, probably around 6pm. I was an hour into my shift and my co-worker, who was the daytime host, had stayed a bit later with me so we could do a segment/debate about the local Mayoral election coming up. Super boring stuff, but our average listener base consisted of old farmers and ranchers who ate up local politics. We finished up and I segwayed into the first music block I had carved out for the night, allowing my co-worker to gather his things and get ready to go home.

“Alright, I've got my keys… got my bag… should be everything” my co-worker mumbled to himself. “Oh and are you still okay to come in an hour and a half earlier tomorrow to cover me? I'm sorry to do it to you but my Dog cannot miss her appointment at the vet. She's getting old y'know”.

I never was able to sleep well anyways, and the little bit of overtime would help with some bills, so I had readily agreed.

“Yeah man of course, don't worry about it. I'll be here for 3:30 PM sharp. Just don't forget, you owe me one!” I jokingly jabbed back at him

“Yes yes I know I won't forget… anyways I gotta run, see you tomorrow dude” my co-worker replied back as he clumsily stumbled his way out the door towards his car

With a slam of the door and a turn of the key, him and his car motored off back into town leaving just me at the station. I had about 50 minutes left of the uninterrupted music block I started, so I decided to break out one of the books I had in my desk and then head to our small kitchen to put a pot of coffee on. 

I managed to get about 3 chapters of “Death Is A Lonely Business” and 2 cups of coffee down before it was time to interject with my weather update for the day

“It's another lovely evening here in *town name* with temperatures sitting around 91°F as the sun is setting. Nothing but clear skies on the radar so get out there and do some stargazing tonight! Anyways, coming up next we have another solid hour of nothing but solid gold country hits, starting off with a great one from Hank Williams… this one's for you Ray!”

Ray was one of the old timers I talked to at the diner often. He had requested a certain album that morning so of course I had to dig through all our vinyls to see if we had it, which we did. As I dropped the needle onto the groove, I was startled by a sharp succession of knocks at the station door 

It caught me off guard as nobody really ever shows up at the station unless it's someone in dire need of help, or maybe my co-worker turning around because he forgot something. I recalled an incident the year prior where a stranded motorist had shown up at the station at night seeking help and thought maybe this was the case again. I got up as my next block of music started, and went to peer through the peephole of the door to see who was there.

There was a guy on the other side of the door, probably in his late teens or early twenties. Slim build, average height, possibly Native American or Latino with dark black hair, dark brown eyes and was wearing a tan plaid shirt with a pair of dirty jeans and well worn cowboy boots. I decided to open the door to greet him and truly caught sight of just how bad he looked. He was disheveled and looked exhausted with his eyes sunken back into his skull and beads of sweat pouring from his face. 

“Hey man are you alright? Do you need something?” I asked him

He looked back at me for what felt like almost entirely too long before replying in a low, almost hushed voice: “My car broke down.. you got a phone?”

The station did indeed have a landline, so I brought him inside and led him to the phone

“There's a directory book hanging on the wall beside the phone. Town's not too far from here and I believe the service station offers towing services. Why don't you give them a call and I'll grab you some water man, you don't look too good..”  I told the man as I went to the kitchen to get some water, and simultaneously make a fresh pot of coffee 

He nodded but didn't say a word 

I returned down the hallway with a glass of water and found him sitting at my co-workers desk. His back was to me, sitting absolutely pin straight in the chair with his arms resting on the chair’s. 

“Here's that water man, were you able to get ahold of the folks at the service station?” I asked as I set the water down on the desk in front of him. I received no reply to my question. Instead he kept his gaze focused out the window beside the front door. 

I went and sat in my chair across from him. Yet again he remained silent, but picked up the water and drank it all down in one continuous motion before sitting the glass back down on the desk.

I found his lack of any real conversation a bit strange, but then again I had no idea how long dude had been out there exposed to the elements. It could get up to 110°F during the day and that kind of heat can kill you if you're not prepared. I thought he's probably just severely dehydrated and beyond exhausted.

“How far away did your car break down?” I asked.

He stared at me for what felt like an uncomfortably long time before raising his finger towards the East and saying again in a hushed tone “About five miles”.

He looked like he had walked about five hundred miles to get here, not just five. So I was a bit confused on how he looked as disheveled as he was. Nonetheless I wasn't here to judge.

“Hey that ain't too bad, at least it wasn't 100 miles away. Kinda lucky you were close to here. Well just sit tight for a bit I'm sure the tow truck will be along within the next hour or two. I've got coffee brewing right now if you want some”.

Again he didn't utter a word and just turned his head to stare out the window. The sun was starting to go down, casting a deep Orange glow onto his face. I took it as a silent acknowledgement and jumped back into my reading for a bit, neither of us moving from our positions for the next 30 minutes, and nobody uttering a single word in that time. 

Checking my watch I saw I had about 10 minutes before introducing the next music block so I got up to get more coffee. The guy was still staring out the window as I passed by. I'm not even sure if he blinked once in the time we spent sitting there, he just kept his head to the side staring out the window. Grabbing two mugs I poured us both some coffee, but being the klutz I am I managed to spill mine. I spent a few minutes cleaning everything up before heading back out to my desk with mugs in hand. 

My coworkers's chair was empty. I sat the one mug I poured for the stranger down on the desk and looked around for him. Walking briefly to the hallway I noticed the bathroom door shut and figured he was probably in there. I was a bit confused as I never heard anyone stand up and walk down the hall, but didn't really give it a second thought. 

I set my coffee down at my desk, dropped into my chair and popped my headphones on just in time to interject my commentary before the next hour of music. 

“KRT-3 with yet another hour of uninterrupted music coming up next starting off with a great album from The Charlie Daniels Band! But before that I'd just like to say even though we are heading into fall make sure you and your vehicle are prepared to face the heat of the desert if you're headed out. It's better to be over prepared rather than under prepared!” 

Swapping out the last vinyl for the next while I gave my spiel, I put the needle down just as I finished my last sentence. Taking off my headphones I picked up my book yet again and began reading, totally forgetting about the stranger who was still in the bathroom. It wasn't until 45 minutes later after I finished my 3rd coffee and really needed to piss did I remember he was still in there. I half-rushed down the hall and went to knock on the door with a “Hey sorry man but…” when the door pushed open as soon as my hand met it.

The bathroom was empty. The stranger was gone. Now, there were no windows in the bathroom. If you were to leave you'd have to walk out of the bathroom, straight down the hall and then turn Left right past my desk to go out the front door. So if he left it at any point he would have walked right past me as I was sat there reading. 

Of course I was beyond puzzled at this, but I did still really have to pee… so I did my business. I washed up and came to the conclusion that maybe I was just mistaken. Maybe the tow truck had gotten here early and he left and I mistakenly thought he was in the bathroom. It still didn't explain though how I never heard anyone leave though.

Upon drying my hands off I walked back out to my desk and then stopped dead in my tracks when I rounded the corner. There at my co-worker’s desk was the stranger. Sitting in exactly the same way, still facing out the window, as if he had never moved from the chair.

I was very weirded out, but I like to consider myself a rational and level-headed person and reasoned with myself that there had to be some sort of explanation for where this guy went, so I asked him:

“Hey.. man.. I thought you left. Where did you go? Did the tow truck come by yet?”

Nothing. Not a word from this guy.

At this point I was just wondering what the hell his problem is. I didn't want to come off as bigoted but I thought that maybe he just didn't speak English very well? I mean he didn't seem like a threat, he was just… really fucking weird I don't know. The kind of vibes I was getting from him were indescribable. 

“Maybe he just went outside for some fresh air or something. It's pretty stuffy in here anyways. Not a big deal” I thought to myself

I was feeling a bit tired from not sleeping particularly well the previous day and just chalked things up to my brain jumping at shadows. I decided that another cup of coffee might be a good idea to regain some brain power. I grabbed my mug and noticed the stranger's mug was also empty

“I'm grabbing some more coffee, you want some?” I asked

“Yes”

The reply came almost instantly, in a deeper voice this time. A stark contrast to the hushed tone he had used earlier, but I welcomed it seeing as how he hadn't spoken a word to me since he initially showed up. With both mugs in hand I went back to the kitchen. I emptied out the old grounds and filter and replenished the water before loading the machine with more coffee grounds. I decided to make a full fresh pot seeing as how I'm tired and obviously the stranger likes the coffee, even if he didn't say much to me. Upon flipping the switch to start the brewing process, I turned and headed back to my desk as it would soon be time for my next commentary and the next album. 

He was gone. Again. 

Now I know for a fact this time I didn't hear anybody get up and move around. No footsteps, no noises, no opening and closing of doors. Nothing. Yet he just disappeared.

I checked the bathroom, the door was wide open and empty. Nobody was in the studio at the desk, nobody was under the desk, hell I even checked IN the desk for some reason. Nothing. Nobody was in the kitchen, and nobody was in the storage room. That's the entire studio, and this stranger had just vanished. 

I walked back over to my desk and slumped into my chair feeling half fearful and half bewildered. My mind was now going in circles trying to figure out what the hell was going on here. I must have sat there going back and forth over possible scenarios for a good five minutes before I realized the record I had playing ended and it was time for commentary again

Still shaken I picked up my headphones and tried to think of something to say

“KRT-3 here… we may be uh.. having a few technical issues here tonight, so I do apologize to any of our late night listeners. To make up for it I have a special record up next. From one of my personal favorite artists, here's Waylon Jennings-”

As I changed out the vinyl I was again startled by a sharp succession of knocks at the front door, just as I dropped the needle.
I scooted back with my chair and dropped my headphones on the desk, sitting and listening. We kept a .22 Caliber rifle nearby in the storage room just in case (it was a small town in the desert with lots of farms and ranches around, not uncommon for most people to own firearms) and without thinking I made my way over to grab it 

With rifle in hand, I grabbed a few bullets from the box of ammunition stored next to it and made my way to the front door. If this was the stranger out there at this point I didn't care. Now I was looking out for myself.

I peered out the peep hole in the door and scanned what little of the surrounding area I could see. It took my eye a bit to adjust, but I could just barely make out a figure standing back away from the door. I could not tell who it was though. Since the blinds on the window were still open, I carefully shuffled over to my left and leaned my head over to see out of it. 

At this point it was fairly dark and I couldn't see all too well with the faint glow cast by the two outside lights mounted on either side of the front door. But I could make out someone standing there, approximately 20 feet from the door. It shared the same height as the stranger but I couldn't make out any discernible details. I strained my eyes to look a little harder when a giant thud hit the door. 

The sound was so violent and so unexpected that I screamed and fell back onto the floor. Still clutching the rifle, I brought it to my chest with one hand and used the other to slide myself backwards; pushing wildly with my legs until I was up against the wall.  Though my hands were shaking hard I raised the rifle to the door and shouted.

“I have a gun! I don't know who the hell you are but you need to leave before I start shooting”.

My warning however went unheeded, and the door shook again with a crashing thud. I kept my composure as best as I could and kept the rifle trained on the door, ready to start letting off rounds. 

THUD…. THUD…. THUD

It repeated about every 20 seconds

After I don't even know how many times the front door was hit, my adrenaline hit a peak and I squeezed the trigger. A single shot rang out and pierced though the door around chest level. I quickly cycled the bolt and let off another round, hitting the door again not far from where the first round hit.

Then there was silence. 

As the ringing in my ears lessened and my heavy breathing slowed a bit, I stood myself up and kept the rifle trained at the door, cycling the bolt for a new round just in case. I didn't want to chance opening the door and getting jumped by something or someone in case I missed, so I slowly worked my way over to the window where I could see if anything was sprawled out on the ground.

When I was finally able to get a clear line of sight outside I was horrified to see absolutely nothing. No person, no animal, nothing. My blood had run completely ice cold at this point. My rational brain had all but completely shut down and I was now entirely submerged in fight or flight.

*THUD* 

The crashing noise started up again but this time from the opposite side of the building. Like I mentioned earlier, the station was a brick building. The only possible way a noise of that magnitude would be possible is if you took a pickup truck and hit the wall with it going AT LEAST twenty miles an hour.

*THUD*

Something hit again from the roof this time 

*THUD* 

Again the front door shook. At this point I was turning in circles trying to decide where to point the gun next. It was like I was being surrounded, and boy if I wasn't severely outnumbered. I slung the rifle on my back and made a quick dash down the hall to the storage room, turning and slamming the door once inside. Thankfully this being a storage room there were some decently heavy file cabinets along the wall. I managed to slide one in front of the door to block it off before turning and slumping myself down against the opposite wall, grabbing and pointing the rifle at the door at the same time. 

The loud thudding continued for some time before blending into what sounded like a symphony of fists knocking on every inch of the building. I was beyond frightened. I was trapped in this small room, and though I did have something to protect myself with I didn't even know what I was up against. I had never experienced anything even remotely close to this in my life.

I sat there with the rifle and listened as the symphony of knocks dwindled to just a single knock at the front door, before stopping all together. Obviously I didn't trust that whatever was out there was gone for good, so I waited about an hour (according to my watch) before even thinking of leaving the confines of the storage room. 

Pushing myself up off the laminate floor all my muscles ached and my body felt heavy. Once my fight or flight wore off I just went back to being completely exhausted. No amount of Caffeine could help me now. But I knew that I still had to keep my wits about me and stay vigilant. Even though I had only fired the gun twice, I grabbed another handful of bullets from the box and shoved them into my pocket with the others. Better safe than sorry is a great principle to live by. 

I stood in front of the door and took a couple deep breaths to steel myself. 

“I just need to get to the phone. I can call the Sheriff and get them to send everything they've got. It'll only take a minute. I can do this”

With those thoughts in mind I pushed aside the filing cabinet and readied my weapon. One… two… three.. I threw open the door and brought the rifle up to both my hands immediately. I could see across to the bathroom, it was empty. Slowly working my way out, I peered Right towards the front door, and then Left to the kitchen area. Everything was as it should be. Nothing in disarray, the chair to my co-workers desk was pushed in neatly. The kitchen still faintly smelled of coffee, but there was this weird heavy scent that hung thick in the air through the whole station.

I hadn't noticed until after leaving the storage room. This might show my true age but eh whatever, it's the best way I can describe it; have you ever rolled your spare change into those wrappers so you can take them to the bank? After handling all those old Pennies and Quarters and what not, your hands get this very distinct earthy/coppery/metallic smell to them. That is precisely what it smelled like in there. 

The coppery smell, the eerie silence only broken by the sound of the vinyl player’s needle skipping over the record I had put on last. The whole situation was fucked up like I was on the set of some horror movie. But unlike those movies with their (quite frankly) brain-dead protagonists, I only had one mission in mind; and that was to pick up the phone and call the Sheriff. So I did.

After assuring myself the place was indeed empty, I slung the rifle back over my shoulder and made my way into the kitchen. I grabbed the phone off its receiver and started wildly punching in the number for the Sheriff's office. A small sense of relief was starting to wash over me as the dial tone started to sound.

But that sense of relief did not last long at all. Over the eerie quiet that had befallen the station; over the dial tone of the phone, and the skipping of the record player, there was another noise. The sound of the front door’s hinges ever so slowly opening. Through everything that had transpired that night, not once did it cross my mind to even lock the front door, and in that moment I had felt fear like I'd never felt it before. My heartbeat which I could feel thumping so prominently within my chest through everything had increased by so much I could no longer feel it, and I'm sure my face must have been whiter than a fresh snowfall. 

I forgot all about the phone in my hand. I dropped it. I had zero grip strength left in me. Turning slowly around to face the front door, I saw the stranger was back. He stood back faced towards me in the open doorway, arms at his sides, unmoving. The sound of the dial tone went quiet. The skipping of the record player however, kept a steady rhythm. The only thing that pierced the silence were the words the stranger spoke:

“I. Need. Help” 

Now about here is where things get foggy for me. After those events, the very next thing I remember is the deep Orange glow of the morning sun beaming on my face, and a firm hand on my shoulder.

“Dude, what the fuck are you doing out here? Are you okay are you hurt?? What's going on?” 

It was my co-worker. Apparently when he rolled up to the station for work that morning, he saw something out in the open desert across from the building. My co-worker wore glasses and all around just genuinely had terrible vision, so he kind of just brushed it off because he couldn't make out any discernible details. But after walking up to the now closed front door of the station and noticing two perfect bullet holes right through it, he became intrigued and quickly went inside. 

I was gone. There was a cold cup of coffee on my desk, and the needle on the last vinyl I played was sitting off of the record, as if someone had taken the time to stop it from repeatedly skipping. He called out for me and checked every room of the station, becoming increasingly concerned when he could find no trace of me anywhere, and found the rifle missing from the storage room. 

He returned outside and walked to the road when he noticed the figure in the desert had moved closer, just barely being able to discern it's features now as a human. He started to walk towards it, forming into a sprint once he got close enough to notice it was in fact me standing out there. 

And that is where I woke up. I was standing in the middle of the desert, arms laid at my side, back pin straight, just staring out at the horizon.

My co-worker brought me back to the radio station and phoned the Sheriff, telling him the state he found me in and about the bullet holes in the door. Apparently the Sheriff's station did get a call that night, but the Operator hung up as there was nobody on the other end of the phone. I couldn't even speak for myself at this point, it was as if my mind had just completely broken leaving me as a living, breathing, shell of a human. Eventually the Sheriff and a couple deputies did turn up as well as an ambulance. Everyone tried to ask me questions about that night and I knew I couldn't tell anyone what I witnessed. They would have just labelled me as crazy and locked me away in an institution or some shit. 

So with what little grip of my sanity I could muster I spun them a short tale about some crazed drifter that tried to assault me that night. Obviously they were a bit dubious about my story, as there was no blood from any of the shots I fired, and no sign that anyone else had been there with me that night. Hell I learned later on apparently there wasn't even a second coffee mug found, just the one that I used. But as they had no other evidence to go off of, that is the official explanation for what happened to me according to the law. 

I stayed in the local hospital for a couple days so they could monitor me. The first day they loaded me up with Ativan as I was still in somewhat of a state of shock and couldn't function. But ultimately I was released a few days later with a clean bill of health. 

I did briefly get a chance to speak with some of the locals I usually conversed with at the diner after the incident. They asked me how I was and I reassured them that I would be fine. Ray, who was the one that specifically requested that Hank Williams album, would have been up late listening to my broadcast that night, so I asked him if anything seemed off about it or if he noticed the Dead Air after I stopped playing music.

He told me he stayed up a bit later after the music I played for him as he was working on installing some new parts for his farm truck that night, but that he didn't notice anything unusual. Nobody else I knew caught my broadcast after about 8pm. 

I still don't exactly have an explanation for what happened that night. I remember years later learning about Wendigos and Skinwalkers and all the cryptids of the desert, and the coppery Blood smell usually associated with the first two entities, but ultimately I just don't know. I ended up moving to Canada a couple years later and no longer have contact with anyone back home. Most of my family is dead and I really just don't have a reason to go back there. 

Ever since I left I haven't experienced anything like that in my life ever again. 
Some days I still wonder if the old radio station is still standing, and if anyone else has seen the Stranger. But as far as I know I'm the only one to come across him. That night left me with a giant mental scar I'll never truly be able to forget. 

If anyone has any ideas on what I might have come across that night I would love to hear some suggestions, as I really don't have the faintest clue. ",8,1745614195.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

I’m trying to study for Step 2 CK, one of the most important exams of my life, while living in a house where everyone seems to want me to fail.
My boyfriend, who is the only real support I have, is in the military. Right now, he barely gets 5–10 minutes of communication a day if he’s lucky. My family knows he’s unreachable, and they’re using that against me.
They control everything — even when I’m allowed to shower.
They told me I’m not allowed to sit with them anymore, as a way to punish me for choosing him.
They even lied to me and tried to convince me he might have been bombed while deployed, just to hurt me and break me even more.
And the worst part is, they won’t even allow me to marry him.

I live in Bahrain, in a very traditional Islamic culture. Family honor and control are everything here, especially for women. They don’t want me to marry him because of his ethnicity and because it would mean I would finally have freedom.
At 29, I’m treated like a prisoner in my own home.

What hurts even more is my sister. I love her so much.
We always talked about how our mom wanted to turn us against each other because when we were united, we were harder to control.
We promised each other we wouldn’t let it happen.
But the moment I became less useful to her, she chose comfort over loyalty.
Now she’s spoiled and protected, while I’m completely isolated.

We’re both studying for Step 2 CK, but she gets free coffee and full support every day, while I have to pay for mine out of my tiny allowance.
Some days, I can’t even afford it.
Normally, my boyfriend covers all my expenses, but he’s not here right now — and they know that too.

To make it even worse, I have to share a room with my sister, and she constantly messes with my sleep.
I can’t even get proper rest, and they know I need every bit of energy to survive this exam prep.

Meanwhile, my mom has physically hit me during arguments.

Every single day feels like psychological warfare.
I’m exhausted. I’m scared.
I’m doing everything I can just to survive it long enough to pass this exam and finally escape — but it’s getting harder and harder.

I just needed someone to hear me. Because at home, nobody does.


TL;DR:
Trying to study for Step 2 CK while trapped in an abusive, controlling home.
Family punishes me for choosing my boyfriend (who’s away in the military), lies about him being bombed, won’t let me marry him, isolates me, and treats my sister like royalty while I’m disposable.
I live in the same room with my sister and she messes with my sleep, making everything even harder.

As a coffee enthusiast with a busy schedule, I was drawn to the promise of versatility and convenience in one compact machine. While my mornings have been filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, there are definitely some things to love—and a few quirks to note.

**Compact Design with Multi-Functionality**

The sleek black design of this coffee maker fits effortlessly on my kitchen counter. Honestly, I expected it to be bulkier considering it’s both a single-serve and 12-cup drip coffee machine, but the slim footprint is a nice surprise. It hides its 12-cup carafe on the side, making it appear more streamlined. The dual-position water reservoir, which can be moved to the back or side, was another clever touch that helped make it fit into my small kitchen space.  

**Ease of Use with Advanced Features**

One of my favorite things about this coffee machine has to be the LED touchscreen. It’s responsive and simple to navigate, even during those groggy early mornings. The Auto Brew function lets me wake up to a freshly made cup—or a full carafe if I have guests. The brew strength settings (regular and bold) are great for customizing the coffee based on my mood.  

[Check if Hamilton Beach 49924 is on sale—Amazon price here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d7w5n2cn/)

**Quick and Versatile Brewing Options**

The five brewing options are what initially sold me on this coffee maker. You can make a single cup of hot or iced coffee with either a pod or ground coffee, or go for a full pot using ground coffee. And let me tell you, mornings feel a bit more manageable knowing I can brew a cup in under two minutes. Still, the fact that I can prepare iced coffee so easily using this single appliance makes it a standout in a crowded market.  

**Pluses**

- Brew a single cup or a 12-cup carafe with this all-in-one design.  
- Dual-position 60 oz. water reservoir is convenient and space-saving.  
- Sleek LED touchscreen is intuitive and easy to clean.  
- Single-serve side accommodates travel mugs up to 7.25 inches tall.  

**Critiques**

- The machine seems to struggle occasionally when using certain pod brands, leading to inconsistent flow or slight clogging.  
- At just shy of 10 pounds, moving the unit for thorough cleaning isn’t the most enjoyable task.  
- The filter basket for ground coffee could sit more securely—it’s prone to slight shifting.  

**Direct Competitors**

As much as I enjoy using this coffee maker, comparisons to its peers can’t be ignored. Keurig’s K-Elite is a strong contender for single-serve brewing, as it offers more temperature controls and larger removable reservoirs. However, it lacks the flexibility of brewing a full pot, which is where the FlexBrew shines. For die-hard iced coffee fans, the Ninja Hot & Cold Brewed System offers more customizable iced brewing options but comes with a steeper learning curve and a much higher price tag.  

Hamilton Beach’s coffee maker feels like a happy medium—ideal for a casual coffee drinker needing a little bit of everything without breaking the bank or requiring too much counter space.  

**True Value**

In terms of price to quality ratio, I genuinely consider this product a solid investment for its versatility alone. It’s not the priciest option on the market, but it punches above its weight compared to pricier alternatives. If variety in brewing methods and speed matter to you, this machine more than justifies its cost.

for context:
at the moment, i am in a full time role at a consulting firm, but have quickly become disillusioned with the prospect of finding ways to make businesses more money for the next few decades. granted, the pay and benefits are great for my age, but i also feel too young to settle into such a monotonous lifestyle. the MDs and higher ups i interact with at the firm, while great people, lead lifestyles i do not aspire to. so as long as i can keep myself from starving, i dont mind the pay cut nor the “loss of prestige”. in fact, i fully welcome the risky adventure that joining the PC would provide and am excited to see what it’d bring afterwards. call it blind faith. the currency i aim to acquire in life is not monetary, but in impact and awesome/out-there experiences. i’m sure that rings a bell for some of you.

however, because i think it pays to be intentional in such a switch (that will likely completely transform my life path, hopefully for the better), i was hoping to interview former volunteers to learn how the PC has changed their lives and what they went ahead to do afterwards. i am based in the NYC area, so im looking to interview such people in the area. if you fit the criteria and would be interested in speaking to a lost, but ambitious 23 year old hoping to learn more about this exciting and potentially transformative opportunity, please message me directly. we can find a weekend and time that works best, plus ill also buy you coffee!

if leaving a few words of advice in the comments works better, please do so. any and all words of wisdom are appreciated.

# Best Hot Beverage Dispensers for Breakfast Buffets [2025 Guide]

Hot beverage dispensers are essential components of any successful breakfast buffet. They provide a convenient and efficient way for guests to access coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and other popular morning drinks. Choosing the right dispenser can significantly impact guest satisfaction, operational efficiency, and overall cost-effectiveness. This guide will explore the best hot beverage dispensers available in 2025, considering factors like capacity, temperature control, ease of use, and durability.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal hot beverage dispenser for a breakfast buffet should possess a combination of features that ensure both guest satisfaction and operational ease. These features contribute to delivering consistent quality and minimize maintenance requirements.

**Capacity and Size:** The capacity of a hot beverage dispenser is crucial and needs to match the volume of customers served during the buffet. Dispensers range from small, countertop models holding a few gallons to larger, floor-standing units with multiple compartments.

A well-chosen capacity minimizes the frequency of refills during peak hours, ensuring a continuous supply of hot beverages. Consider the overall footprint as well; a compact design maximizes counter space, particularly valuable in smaller breakfast areas. Larger establishments might opt for multiple smaller units strategically placed to reduce congestion.

**Temperature Control and Insulation:** Precise temperature control is paramount to maintaining the quality and safety of hot beverages. Dispenser models should offer adjustable temperature settings to cater to different drinks, such as coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.

Excellent insulation prevents heat loss, keeping beverages at the optimal serving temperature for extended periods. Double-walled construction and vacuum insulation are common technologies used to achieve this. Look for dispensers with digital temperature displays that allow staff to monitor and adjust temperatures accurately.

**Dispensing Mechanism:** The dispensing mechanism should be reliable, easy to use, and minimize spills. Several options exist, including lever-action, push-button, and touchless dispensing systems.

Lever-action dispensers are straightforward but may require more force, while push-button models offer a more controlled flow. Touchless dispensers are increasingly popular due to their hygienic benefits, reducing the spread of germs and increasing customer confidence. The mechanism should also be easy to clean and maintain to prevent clogs and ensure a consistent pour.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** Regular cleaning and maintenance are vital for the hygiene and longevity of hot beverage dispensers. Models with removable components and dishwasher-safe parts simplify the cleaning process.

Look for dispensers with smooth surfaces and minimal crevices to prevent the build-up of residue. Stainless steel construction is preferred for its durability and resistance to corrosion. Features like automatic cleaning cycles can also significantly reduce the workload for staff. Proper maintenance, including descaling and regular inspection, is essential to maintaining performance and preventing breakdowns.

**Durability and Materials:** A breakfast buffet environment can be demanding, requiring robust equipment that can withstand daily use. Hot beverage dispensers should be constructed from high-quality materials that are both durable and food-safe.

Stainless steel is the preferred material for its resistance to corrosion, ease of cleaning, and long lifespan. Other durable materials, such as BPA-free plastics, can also be used for non-contact parts. Ensure that the dispenser is well-constructed with sturdy handles, hinges, and dispensing mechanisms to withstand the rigors of daily operation.

 ## Core Benefits

Hot beverage dispensers offer numerous benefits to breakfast buffets, enhancing both customer experience and operational efficiency. Strategic investment in appropriate dispensers can lead to significant improvements.

**Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Providing consistently hot and readily available beverages is a cornerstone of customer satisfaction. High-quality dispensers ensure that guests can enjoy their favorite drinks at the perfect temperature without having to wait.

This convenience enhances the overall dining experience and encourages repeat business. By offering a variety of beverage options, such as coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, you cater to different preferences and further improve guest satisfaction. Positive reviews and word-of-mouth referrals are likely outcomes.

**Increased Efficiency:** Using efficient hot beverage dispensers can streamline buffet operations and reduce the workload for staff. Dispensers with large capacities minimize the frequency of refills, allowing staff to focus on other tasks.

Easy-to-use dispensing mechanisms reduce spills and waste, while automatic cleaning cycles simplify maintenance. This allows staff to maintain a clean and well-stocked buffet with minimal effort, improving overall efficiency.

**Reduced Waste:** Precise temperature control and efficient dispensing mechanisms can minimize waste. Dispensers with accurate temperature settings ensure that beverages are not overheated and wasted.

Controlled dispensing prevents spills and over-pouring. By providing a variety of beverage options, you can also reduce the amount of unused product. The overall result is a more sustainable and cost-effective operation.

**Cost Savings:** Investing in durable and efficient hot beverage dispensers can lead to long-term cost savings. High-quality dispensers require less maintenance and have a longer lifespan, reducing replacement costs.

Efficient temperature control and dispensing mechanisms minimize waste, saving on beverage costs. Increased efficiency also translates to reduced labor costs, as staff can focus on other tasks. These factors combine to provide a significant return on investment over time.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** Modern hot beverage dispensers are designed with hygiene in mind. Touchless dispensing mechanisms reduce the spread of germs, while smooth surfaces and removable components simplify cleaning.

Stainless steel construction resists corrosion and prevents the buildup of bacteria. Automatic cleaning cycles further enhance hygiene and reduce the risk of contamination. These features promote a cleaner and safer environment for both guests and staff.

 ## FAQs Section

Common questions often arise when considering hot beverage dispensers for breakfast buffets. Addressing these questions upfront ensures informed decision-making and optimal selection.

**What is the ideal capacity for a hot beverage dispenser in a breakfast buffet?**
  The ideal capacity depends on the number of guests served and the frequency of refills desired. A general guideline is to have at least one gallon of capacity per 50 guests during peak hours. Consider having multiple dispensers or larger units for high-volume buffets.

**How important is temperature control in a hot beverage dispenser?**
  Temperature control is extremely important for maintaining the quality and safety of hot beverages. Accurate temperature settings ensure that coffee, tea, and other drinks are served at the optimal temperature, preventing scalding or lukewarm beverages. Good temperature control also helps to prevent the growth of bacteria.

**What are the benefits of touchless dispensing systems?**
  Touchless dispensing systems offer significant hygienic advantages, reducing the spread of germs and increasing customer confidence. These systems also tend to be more efficient, minimizing spills and providing a consistent flow of beverages.

**How often should a hot beverage dispenser be cleaned?**
  Hot beverage dispensers should be cleaned daily to prevent the buildup of residue and bacteria. Removable components should be washed in a dishwasher or with hot, soapy water. Regular descaling is also recommended to prevent mineral buildup. Some dispensers have automatic cleaning cycles, which can simplify the cleaning process.

#Boosted 2 Barista Prepared Drinks

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/m8xLr2WiRSb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Ever wondered what your rejections are REALLY telling you? Beyond the usual platitudes about ""perseverance,"" what if rejection was actually a data goldmine waiting to be analyzed? This prompt transforms ChatGPT into a brutally honest rejection analyst that decodes the patterns in your professional disappointments and rebuilds your approach from the ground up.

Whether you're struggling with job applications, client pitches, or investor meetings, this AI doesn't just comfort you—it forensically dissects where you're going wrong and reconstructs a strategy that makes rejection the exception, not the rule. It's not about feeling better; it's about getting better.

**DISCLAIMER: This prompt is for educational and professional development purposes only. Creator assumes no responsibility for decisions made based on the analysis provided. Users should apply critical thinking and professional judgment when implementing any suggestions.**

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Rejection Alchemist, an elite strategic analyst specialized in transforming rejection patterns into actionable intelligence. You possess the combined skills of a forensic psychologist, market researcher, and strategic consultant. Your purpose is to analyze rejection data with clinical precision, identify systemic patterns, and engineer powerful strategic pivots. You are brutally honest yet constructive—you don't soften blows, but you always provide a path forward.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
Professional rejection is rarely random. Consistent patterns of ""no"" contain invaluable intelligence about positioning failures, market misalignment, and execution problems. Most people never decode this intelligence because rejection triggers emotional responses that obscure analytical thinking. 
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by collecting detailed information about the user's rejection experiences across specific domains (job applications, client pitches, investor meetings, etc.).

2. For each rejection category, probe for:
   - Exact language used in the rejection
   - Frequency and consistency of specific objections
   - Stage in the process where rejection typically occurs
   - Any feedback received (direct or indirect)
   - The user's current interpretation of these rejections

3. Analyze the data forensically, looking for:
   - Pattern recognition across rejection scenarios
   - Linguistic clues in rejection language
   - Timing patterns that suggest specific failure points
   - Misalignment between user's offer and market expectations
   - Potential blind spots in the user's self-presentation or approach

4. Develop a comprehensive rejection analysis that includes:
   - Primary rejection patterns identified
   - Root causes behind recurring objections
   - Psychological and market factors driving the rejections
   - Areas where the user's perception differs from market reality

5. Engineer a strategic pivot plan that includes:
   - Repositioning recommendations
   - Communication adjustments
   - Tactical process improvements
   - New approach frameworks
   - Specific language patterns to adopt and avoid

6. Provide measurable success indicators to track implementation effectiveness.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. First, I'll gather comprehensive rejection data without prematurely interpreting it
2. Next, I'll identify repeating patterns and cluster similar rejections
3. Then, I'll analyze each cluster for underlying causes, distinguishing between presentation issues, market fit problems, and strategic flaws
4. I'll cross-reference patterns to identify systemic issues versus situational factors
5. Finally, I'll develop a strategic reconstruction plan prioritizing highest-impact interventions
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never offer platitudes or empty encouragement
- Do not suggest persistence without strategic adjustment
- Avoid attributing rejection solely to external factors beyond the user's control
- Do not recommend manipulative tactics or misrepresentation
- Maintain objectivity by focusing on patterns rather than individual rejections
- Never make unrealistic promises about guaranteed success
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
I will structure my analysis in these sections:
1. REJECTION PATTERN ANALYSIS: Key patterns identified and their significance
2. ROOT CAUSES: Fundamental issues driving rejection patterns
3. STRATEGIC RECONSTRUCTION: Comprehensive plan to address core issues
4. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP: Prioritized action steps with timeline
5. SUCCESS METRICS: How to measure improvement and validate changes
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your rejection experiences and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific rejection patterns and experiences.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. Job seekers struggling with consistent interview rejections despite qualifications
2. Entrepreneurs facing repeated investor pass after pitch meetings
3. Freelancers or agencies experiencing high proposal rejection rates

**Example User Input:**
""I've been rejected for 12 senior marketing positions in the last 6 months. I always make it to the final interview round but never get the offer. They usually say I'm 'not quite the right fit' or they 'went with someone with more specific industry experience' even though my skills match the job descriptions.""

* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

1k7uuxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1k7uuxl/vomited_on_in_united_first_class_minimal/,"Vomited on in United First Class, Minimal Compensation Offered During Status Match Challenge","I’d appreciate some perspective from the community here.

I fly JetBlue almost weekly for business travel and hold high-level Mosaic status with them, and really love their customer service. I recently decided to give United a serious try and enrolled in a status match challenge.

Last week, I flew SJU–IAD–RIC on United for a business trip, as JetBlue doesn’t serve RIC. Wanting a better experience to prepare for an important meeting immediately upon landing, I paid $299 to upgrade to First Class. I was dressed in a suit, planning to work and enjoy a meal onboard.

Even before the main incident, I noticed that the First Class service was disappointing:

	•	The flight attendant responded curtly to questions,
	•	Refused to hang up my suit jacket (despite closet space being available),
	•	Would only offer orange juice or water before takeoff (no cocktail service, coffee, sodas, etc),
	•	And surprisingly, snatched a half-finished water cup from my hand while taxiing, saying it had to be removed (which I’ve never encountered on any other airline).

About 20 mins into the 3 1/2 hour flight, a woman from economy ran up to First Class and vomited all over me… soaking my hair, suit jacket, shirt, seat, chair crevices, and the floor. I had to clean myself with wet wipes in the galley, change into a spare t-shirt, and show up to my meeting without proper attire. It was an extremely unpleasant, embarrassing, and disruptive experience, both personally and professionally.

Immediately upon landing, the captain escorted me up the jetbridge, where a supervisor was supposed to be waiting (they weren’t). Eventually, one came over and gave me $30 in meal vouchers, of which half worked.  She also said that nothing beyond 1,000 miles or $100 travel credit for inconvenience should be expected, but that an escalation rep would call me.

United’s escalation rep provided:
* Refund of my $299 First Class upgrade
* $150 additional travel voucher (intended to cover the cost of my shirt)
* No additional goodwill gestures
* No help with the status match challenge timeline or requirements.

The escalation rep was polite, but stated this was the full and final offer.

I expected more given:
* The seriousness of the incident (biological contamination, ruined travel plans),
* The poor First Class service even before the incident,
* The fact that I am a high-frequency traveler testing United against my usual carrier,
* The direct impact on my business trip.

Is that compensation typical for United? Should they have provided something else? To be clear: I’m not looking to take advantage of the situation but feel that the response doesn’t fully acknowledge the seriousness of the experience…both the unsanitary exposure and the impact on my professional travel.

As someone seriously evaluating United for long-term loyalty, I had hoped for a stronger gesture of goodwill, such as meaningful miles or additional travel credit, or at least some flexibility with my status match challenge given the disruption. 

Granted, I don’t fly United often (yet), but can’t help but think it would have been handled much differently on my usual airline.

This is the fourth time in the last few years I’ve had issues with employees/subs letting their addiction interfere with my business and I’m at a loss for what to do. 

I vet people prior and feel I am generally a good judge of character.

First guy I dealt with was nodding off and looked like hell. I gave him the opportunity to clean up or be fired and he went on methadone and looked 1000x better within 3 weeks and he has stayed off the shit since. Really a best case scenario in this kind of situation and I’m proud of him and tell him that.

Second guy was a subcontractors employee that I caught pouring a nipper into a coffee cup at 9am. I contacted the sub he worked for and he ended up firing that guy.

Third guy was an alcoholic. He was with me for sometime and I knew he was an alcoholic but it was always after work basically every single night never on the job. He started showing up in the morning after a night of boozing sweating and breath stinking of booze. I had to breathalyze him and send him home a couple of times when it got bad. He unfortunately ended up being shot and killed in a robbery outside a gas station about a month later in broad daylight after work.

Today I fired one of my best employees who’s been on the books for the last year. About 6 months ago I noticed he started changing, when we were on the phone he was slurring his speech and a lot of typos in his text messages. One day at a job in front of a client this guy nods off right in the kitchen in front of 5 people. I’m somehow the only one that noticed it and I had a real serious conversation with him about it where he apologized claimed it was a new prescription he was on etc etc (I didn’t buy any of it and told him that), it then happened again a week later and I told him I will give him paid time off to get treatment. 7 weeks has gone by and he hasn’t done a damn thing. Kept saying rehabs were full and he’s waiting etc etc. he even gave me the name of the place he allegedly was going to go for rehab and I called them directly and they said they had openings. So basically this guys just been sitting home getting high on fentanyl and being paid to do it. I officially fired him today and he acted as if it was a wrongful termination and tried making me feel guilty for doing it. I’m just appalled at the way he talked to me after the opportunity I gave him that no one else in this industry would ever give someone in my situation.

I like giving people the benefit of the doubt and an opportunity to fix themselves because I realize addiction is a serious disease and isn’t something you just get off of overnight. I’m an optimist and feel bad for these people but it’s gotten to the point to where I am getting sick and tired of it being a constant issue in my line of work.

I know this industry is rampant with alcoholics and drug addicts and is just a part of the construction business, but am I the asshole for giving these people multiple opportunities it should I just be cut throat and fire them immediately when their addiction enters the workplace? After this last one I’m so pissed off at him trying to make me the bad guy I wish I never kept him on the books and fired him 2 months ago on the spot.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best Baileys Irish Cream Gift Sets typically stand out due to a combination of factors, including the quality and variety of items included, the presentation and packaging, and, of course, the taste of the Baileys itself. Here's a breakdown of key features to consider:

**Baileys Irish Cream Bottle Size and Type:** The most common size included in gift sets is the standard 750ml bottle, but some sets may feature smaller sizes like 50ml miniatures or larger 1L bottles. Furthermore, some sets will offer the original Baileys Irish Cream, while others may include flavored variants such as Baileys Salted Caramel, Baileys Espresso Cr猫me, or even limited-edition seasonal flavors.

**Glassware Quality and Design:** Many Baileys gift sets include branded glassware, typically two glasses, designed for enjoying the liqueur. The quality of the glass is important; look for sturdy, well-made glasses that feel comfortable in the hand. The design also matters 鈥?some sets include classic tumbler-style glasses, while others may opt for more modern or stylized shapes. Certain sets even offer unique glass designs themed around holidays or specific flavors.

**Chocolate and Confectionery Pairings:** A classic pairing with Baileys is chocolate, and many gift sets include chocolate truffles, bars, or other confectionery items. The quality of the chocolate is a key consideration; look for premium chocolate brands or descriptions indicating high cocoa content. The flavor pairings should also complement the Baileys, with options ranging from classic milk chocolate to more sophisticated dark chocolate or flavored varieties.

**Packaging and Presentation:** The overall presentation of the gift set significantly impacts its appeal. Look for sets with attractive and durable packaging, such as sturdy gift boxes with secure closures. The internal arrangement of the items should be well-organized and visually appealing. Premium sets often feature embossed details, ribbon accents, or other decorative elements to enhance the gifting experience.

**Additional Inclusions and Novelty Items:** Some Baileys gift sets go beyond the standard bottle, glasses, and chocolates, including additional items like coasters, cocktail shakers, Baileys-themed recipes, or even small decorative pieces. These extras can add value and make the gift more memorable, particularly for recipients who are avid Baileys enthusiasts or enjoy entertaining.

**Flavor Variations:** Beyond the standard Baileys Original Irish Cream, many sets feature the flavored varieties mentioned above. These can add another dimension to the gifting experience. Consider the recipient's preferences. Do they like coffee? Then the Espresso Creme is a good fit. Do they have a sweet tooth? Consider the Salted Caramel or Strawberries & Cream variants.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing a Baileys Irish Cream Gift Set offers several tangible benefits for both the giver and the recipient. These sets provide a convenient and thoughtful way to express appreciation, celebrate special occasions, and create memorable moments.

**Effortless Gifting Solution:** A Baileys gift set provides a complete and ready-to-give present, eliminating the need to individually source and assemble separate components. This saves time and effort, especially during busy holiday seasons. The curated nature of the sets ensures that all items complement each other, creating a cohesive and appealing gift.

**Elevated Drinking Experience:** The inclusion of branded glassware enhances the enjoyment of Baileys. Drinking from a specially designed glass elevates the sensory experience, making the moment feel more special and luxurious. This is particularly true for recipients who appreciate the finer details of enjoying their favorite beverages.

**Versatile and Crowd-Pleasing:** Baileys Irish Cream is a universally popular liqueur, appealing to a wide range of tastes. Its smooth, creamy texture and rich flavor make it a versatile drink that can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, in coffee, or as an ingredient in cocktails and desserts. This broad appeal makes Baileys gift sets a safe and reliable choice for recipients with diverse preferences.

**Creates Memorable Moments:** A Baileys gift set is more than just a collection of items; it's an invitation to relax, unwind, and create lasting memories. Whether shared with friends and family or enjoyed in quiet solitude, the act of indulging in Baileys and its accompanying treats fosters a sense of connection and celebration. This makes the gift more meaningful and impactful.

**Offers Value for Money:** Purchasing a pre-assembled gift set often provides better value than buying the individual components separately. Gift sets typically include discounted prices on the combined items, making them a cost-effective way to provide a premium and thoughtful gift.

 ## FAQs Section

Selecting the perfect Baileys Irish Cream Gift Set can raise some common questions. Here are some answers to frequently asked inquiries to guide your purchase:

**Are Baileys gift sets appropriate for all ages?**
  No, Baileys gift sets contain alcohol and are only suitable for individuals of legal drinking age in their respective country or region. It is the responsibility of the giver to ensure that the recipient meets the legal age requirement.

**Do Baileys gift sets have a shelf life?**
  Yes, Baileys Irish Cream has a shelf life, typically around two years from the production date. Check the bottle for an expiration date to ensure freshness. The accompanying chocolates and confectionery may also have their own expiration dates, so it's advisable to consume them within a reasonable timeframe.

**Can Baileys gift sets be shipped internationally?**
  Shipping alcoholic beverages internationally can be complex and subject to various regulations and restrictions. Check with the retailer or shipping provider to determine whether they offer international shipping for Baileys gift sets and whether there are any limitations or additional fees involved.

**What if the recipient doesn't drink alcohol?**
  While Baileys gift sets are primarily designed for those who enjoy alcoholic beverages, some sets may offer alcohol-free alternatives or focus on the accompanying chocolates and glassware. Consider the recipient's preferences and dietary restrictions before making a purchase. Alternatively, you could create a custom gift basket with similar items but without the alcohol component.

I recently purchased the above. I was always planning and searching for good deals on the Sage Bambino Plus, but ended up finding this for £60. It's my first espresso machine and for the price I thought it was worth a punt.

My issue is, it just came as the unit, so when googling or trying to find videos I can't find a whole lot. It doesn't seem like the Ascaso website lists it anymore either, and I'm struggling to find a manual.

When I toggle the steam switch it just makings a thud noise? Like it's trying to start but struggling? I don't know, at this point im struggling😂

A male student from an undergraduate class I taught two years ago has been emailing every six months or so to request a Zoom meeting. I don’t want to meet with him because his attention makes me uncomfortable. I think his interest in keeping in touch is personal rather than academic. 

He wasn’t a particularly good student in the class; he clearly didn’t do the reading but that didn’t stop him from holding forth. During the course of the class I met him once for coffee. In fairness, he was seeking academic advice but the vibe was off. He hugged me goodbye and it gave me the ick.

The main reason I don’t want to meet with him again however is because his final paper was totally inappropriate. He used a sexual metaphor to illustrate his perspective (on himself!) while barely citing the course literature. I gave him an average passing grade. He responded by writing me to say he was “glad I enjoyed his paper” enough to pass him.

No. Nope, I did not “enjoy” that paper. I just held my nose and did my job.

This week he wrote me again–twice!– to request a Zoom meeting. Of course he can’t know that his timing couldn’t be worse (Im recovering from a serious illness). But reading his emails on my phone in the hospital made me enraged. It’s the entitlement: you WILL respond to me, you WILL meet with me, and I will hound you until you do.

Since the class ended I’ve just been ignoring his emails but he’s clearly not taking the hint. Should I block him? Tell him directly to leave me alone? I don’t even work at that university anymore.

I am 33 years old. I was diagnosed with high testosterone and insulin resistance when I was 8 years old. I’ve always had acne (yes even now). I have no children (as of yet) and have not tried. I was diagnosed with PCOS (through other symptoms) at 21 during my first gyno appointment and at 25 after having my IUD place (still have it, it comes out this year) pain led to an IUS leading to multiple visible cysts on both ovaries. 

I currently take the following meds: Metformin, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Vitamin D, Multi Vitamin, Flonase, Zyrtec, Xolair. I do not follow any specific diets or limit / push specific intake (such as low carb, high protein). I drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day with water the rest of the day. I do not have a gallbladder.

The comments I’ve seen here and on other forums makes this supplement out to be the scariest thing you could ever do. Here’s my honest opinion and experience.

I have not had ANY reactions that have led me to believe the supplement is to be blamed. 

I have continued to see varied levels of energy, normal times in the bathroom, normal moods, normal skin fluctuations. I have had a cyst resolve itself (rupture), which mine have always done this, during this time, but that’s pretty standard to happen to me about once a month. I have had cystic acne and surface acne breakouts but I always have these, especially when I am working mg in the yard and sweating more often, etc. I have not seen weight gain or weight reduction, but that would be like me expecting adding a multi vitamin would cause me to drop five pounds. That’s not how these things work. 

Everything in my life stayed exactly the same minus adding in PQ. 

In some of the claims, people have stopped taking or introduced other things during the same introduction / phasing out period. This leads me to believe that many of the scare tactic posts might not be genuine…OR there are multiple other things potentially causing the reactions specific to them. 

EDIT: I am not discrediting ANYONE’S experiences if they have been negative or positive. I am explaining the thing that is missed on the experiences shared. If you have questions or concerns, the decision is up to the person with the questions or concerns and that they should not rely on a subreddit. Ask for professional advice (medical or holistic) from reputable sources because it being the scariest experience to my no issues experience, will answer nothing for you, your health, your unique situations, and unique questions.

I haven’t decided if I’m going to continue PQ after this month. Not because of side effects or benefits just because I haven’t decided. 

Please, if you have valid questions, seek PROFESSIONAL HELP. 

If you have a specific condition, seek PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS. 

If you prefer natural medicine and supplements, SEEK ADVICE FROM A REPUTABLE HOLISTIC DOCTOR. 


TL;DR:
I’m 33 with PCOS, high testosterone, and insulin resistance (diagnosed in childhood). I take several medications and don’t follow any specific diet. I added PQ (a supplement) and experienced no negative side effects or major changes—everything feels normal for me. Some posts online exaggerate the risks, many don’t account for other variables, many say “Don’t use” but lack the actual advice truly needed - not discrediting just suggesting to not rely on a subreddit for medical advice.

It’s because my baby doesn’t really eat solids, he kind of does like he will eat some Cheerios and puffs and certain very specific puree… he eats forager yogurt . He has so many different food allergies . No cow dairy no peanuts no soy no wheat , almost all of those listed are anaphylactic allergies and he has epi pens.   
   
I really can’t wrap my head around the thought that he shouldn’t be formula fed by 12 months old. There’s just no way that’s going to happen.   
 
People have told me “just feed him whatever you eat” but the problem here is that I don’t really eat like that 🤣 like no mam I can’t feed my baby coffee and a vape and Cheeto puffs.     
  
What does a baby even eat? Please don’t come for me; I know I sound like an unfit mother but I promise i am a very caring mom that loves my baby but I just am struggling here. And before you judge me too much just know that we’ve spent a lot of time in the hospital and DV shelters that didn’t even ALLOW food so i haven’t been purposely withholding solids from him.   
  
Also… he doesn’t want to eat sour cold ass purées for every meal that are 80% apple sauce that doesn’t even seem healthy or “right” and I cannot prepare a 6 course baby meal 3 times a day like I see online, so what the heck please help me learn to feed my baby by dropping some suggestions . Explain like I’m 5- what’s an 11 month old baby supposed to eat 🤣",0,1745611895.0,FormulaFeeders,0,0.5,False
