1heba1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1heba1e/aita_for_distancing_myself_from_my_fencesitting/,AITA for distancing myself from my fence-sitting friend?,"This is going to be long so please bear with me.

I (43F) am friends with this person, let's call her 'Gemma' (42F). Gemma is one of those people who never take sides and always complain they're 'in the middle'. She wants to be accepted by everyone and has let toxic people dissolve friendship groups and also attack her personally. Yet, she will go out of her way to help when she can - will get you meds when you're sick, wait for you in hospital rooms if a loved one is in trouble, share your work on social media. But she will never ever defend you even when you have been kicked and punched (metaphorically speaking) in front of her own eyes and will find excuses. 

Now, up to a point, this is understandable. People can't fight your battles for you and as grown-ass adults, we need to be able to defend ourselves. Which is why I have so far tried to accept her for who she is, appreciate her good traits and be empathetic. But then this happened:

We used to be a close friendship trio with this other woman called 'Carly'. Our daughters all played together so we would hang out a lot. At some point, Carly decided to change her career path and I supported her as much as I could (materially and emotionally). I've also had Carly and her family stay over my holiday house multiple times (have even given her keys for when we wouldn't be there), I had her daughter over and took care her as much as I could, and so on.

 Once Carly's career took off, she became extremely arrogant. She had a lot of followers on social media, too. She would comment on her colleagues' work in a derogatory way, would talk over you in a flamboyant way and would constantly project this unreasonable competitiveness (we're on different career paths; she never showed any interest in my work). At some point, we had a fall-out. Couple of weeks later we talked it out and she invited me to her 'retreat', which would cost a few hundred euros. At the same time Gemma informed me that they were planning a family holiday together and I'd better look at tickets. When I told Carly this, she said it was 'too early' after our argument to go on holiday together but in the end she graciously agreed for my family to come as well. I did scratch my head to understand why I was good enough for the retreat but not her holiday but in the end I let it pass.

Anyhow. We did end up going on holiday. And upon our return, Carly started ghosting me, big time until we broke ties completely. I spent two years trying to understand what I'd done wrong. I even went to therapy, read a lot, put all sort of labels on myself (I'm big on guilt). I asked Gemma a few times but she would say that Carly wouldn't share anything with her. At some point, Gemma asked 'are you sure you don't feel insecure because of her huge success?' I was flabbergasted. She would also mention Carly all the time randomly, come to my place and announce 'oh sorry I have to give Carly a call', etc. We continued to meet up and talk but I gradually pulled away. 

Last year, my dream came true and I achieved something I've been working on for the last two decades (neither Gemma nor Carly ever took that seriously). It s big in its own way and as it happens, I'm now in the same industry with Gemma (albeit in different capacities). Gemma had noticed that I had distanced myself and kept asking whether I'm 'giving her the silent treatment' and why I 'like' her posts instead of loving them' and so on. We went for a coffee to discuss and, after two years, she finally revealed why Carly had cut off ties with me. Apparently, her narcissistc scumbag of a husband had told her I had 'made a move on him'.

My jaw dropped. I went numb. I froze. Needless to say that I never, EVER harboured such feelings for that man, if for anything, I found him very difficult, arrogant and repulsive. He would always whine, spoil the mood and never ever lifted a finger to help at gatherings. What was more, this was a \*family\* holiday. Our kids were there, I hadn't been with him alone for one minutes, it was all just unreal. To this day, I still cannot understand why. Gemma showed some pseudo-compassion and said 'I told her that she's crazy and that you'd never do such a thing' but then asked me not to tell anyone else, as Carly had told her confidentially.

At that point, I've had enough. When I confronted her about why she lied to me before and tried  to gaslight me with this and that, she said what she always says 'she asked me not to say anything, I was in the middle'. But I don't see it that way. She knew I was doubting myself. She knew I grieved that relationship for too long. She prioritised Carly and that's fine, I just don't want her in my life anymore. Only reason she finally revealed the truth is because she has something to gain now that I've made a successful entrance in the industry. It's been sometime now but I can't let go off my anger. I was accused of coming onto a married man, the father of a little girl I absolutely loved and cared for, while my own family was there too. People say he is either trying to isolate her or he probably felt like this for me, but I don't care. I am angry, disgusted, enraged. And I feel Gemma absolutely enabled them both. 

You may find that I'm exaggerating, but I felt and still feel absolutely violated. I felt as if this huge, hairy, drooling creature came and licked me all over. My husband has been very supportive and protective, as have my close friends, who all validated me. They know I'd never, ever do something like that and even suggested that Carly was trying to find an excuse to cut off ties because of her own issues. 

To this day, Gemma still sends sparing messages asking me whether I'm angry, why I forgot her birthday (I truly did that day), making baby voices and pretending everything's okay. I've exhausted my patience and just want out. Most of my friends tell me to just ignore her and heal, but there are a couple of people who believe I should be up front and tell her exactly what the issue is. I believe she knows very well what she's done wrong and will try to manipulate me again.

So AITA for wanting to backtrack quietly and let that 'friendship' rest for good, despite the nice things she's done for me in the past?

Apologies for the huge post, I know I'm very well TA for that!

I’m not very knowledgeable about tarot myself and feel ill-equipped to pick one. Here’s what I’m looking for:

-main focus on reference book (she isn’t a big reader and will probably be turned away from anything too dense on history/etc)
-modern interpretations available (if it breaks it into categories like love, career, etc that would be cool.)
-includes reversed interpretations
-easy to navigate 
-hard cover/pretty (may be shallow but it is a gift and if it’s going to be a nightstand/coffee table staple it might as well be nice to look at!)

1heb2yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardGecko/comments/1heb2yk/leopard_lost_was_found_lost_again_found_but_left/,"Leopard Lost was found, lost again, found but left alone and then returned by herself.","One of my female Leopard Geckos got out almost a year ago. Her name is number 4. Not from the movie but from the 4 little freckles on her left lower jaw. She was in a 40 gallon front opening terrarium.  At the time I had a fat cat who loved to sit on top of the tank for the warmth. He broke the top mesh and I made a square barrier so he couldnt get up there anymore. I had a lot of plants in her terrarium so I think she climbed out through the top. We found her after almost 10 months later in the wall heater. We never turned it on, thankfully. She's been living in there crawling up and down. We actually thought it was a mouse and encouraged our cats' to catch it. I lured her out with roaches and waxworms. I put her in a plastic bin with a lid and left to go purchase another terrarium as her old one was now occupied by her little sister Sadie. I found one of those Thrive ecoflex 50.1 gallon front sliding door terrariums. I fed her and watered her. After getting her settled in I accidentally left the door open! She got out again. I looked for her in the heater and yep there she was. I didn't have time to get her out so I left her there. She was warm and safe from my hunter cats. A few days passed and I hadnt gotten her out yet as i was trying to get a coffee table from  FB marketplace, i figured she had been safe  in there for months she could go two more days. I started messing with her terrarium as I bought some lights and more mopani wood. Suddenly, #4  pops her head out from her hide mansion asking for food. How the heck did she get back in there by herself? I did have the tank on milk crates so did she use it as a ladder? I asked my daughter if shed gotten her out of the heater as she is the only one I confessed my 2nd loss and mistake to. She said she hadn't been able to get her out. My husband didn't know I had lost her and everyone else is afraid of them.  How could she be that smart? They aren't supposed to be capable of this kind of intelligence. Does anyone have a clue? They only thing i can assume is that self preservation and a knowledge of where food and safety can be attained stayed in that little brain of hers. She's a lizard genius! I'm out of state otherwise I would take pictures of my sweet escapee. ",2,1734206396.0,LeopardGecko,0,1.0,False

Disclaimer: I love my step son with my whole heart. My problem is my wife and expecting to set boundaries. 

I (M, 36) have been with my wife (F, 35) for 5 years, married for 1.5. My wife has a son from a previous relationship, who is 9. I love him dearly. He used to call me “Dad” (his choice) until his biological father showed up five months ago. His dad told him to stop calling me “Dad.” Since then, he’s gone from introducing me as “Dad” to his friends to calling me “my mom’s husband” (words his dad told him to say).

He’s also openly disrespected me multiple times, making fun of me for being a nerd (even though playing video games used to be our thing). He used to tell me about his day but now he rolls his eyes and tells me to shut up when I ask him how his day was . The whole time, I stayed quiet. I did share with my wife how unhappy I was about it, but she told me to “grow up” because “he’s just a kid.”

Last Tuesday, out of nowhere, he called me saying his dad was supposed to pick him up after school to buy a gift for his mom’s birthday, but he bailed. I told him he did the right thing by calling me and reassured him that his dad probably just got stuck somewhere. I took time off work, picked him up, took him shopping, and even paid for the gift (a perfume). Because what kind of jerk charges a kid?

We had a nice time and talked like we used to. Later, I dropped him off at his dad’s place, but it turned out his dad had completely forgotten about him and was sleeping ( he is unemployed and never paid a cent of child support either)

Last night was my wife’s birthday. My stepson gave her the gift we bought together and said it was from him and his dad. He went on and on about how his dad helped pick it out and paid for it. It hurt, but I assumed he’s just a kid trying to make his loser dad look good. His dad smiled, graciously accepted the compliments, and didn’t correct him. My wife kept praising her ex for being so thoughtful.

Meanwhile, I had gotten her the coffee thermos she’d mentioned wanting. When she opened it, her ex laughed and said, “That’s it? A kid got a better gift than you.” My wife just put my gift aside.

After everyone left (my stepson went back to his dad’s), I told my wife how uncomfortable I was with her ex disrespecting me and her allowing it. She rolled her eyes and said, “Why? Because he was more thoughtful?”

I then told her everything—the situation with the gift, how I paid for it, and how her ex was taking credit. She accused me of lying because I was “being jealous and petty.” I asked her, “Do you not trust me?” but she didn’t answer.

To prove my point, I showed her my phone with the call log showing her son called me on Tuesday. I also showed her my credit card statement online with the purchase. Then I told her I had nothing left to discuss and left to stay at my brother’s house.

My brother thinks I’m right and that my wife should’ve stood up for me and told her ex not to disrespect me. Her family has messaged me saying it was just a misunderstanding and I should let it go. My wife hasn’t apologized and thinks I’m overreacting. She says, “Who cares who paid for what? You’re just being petty. Am I over reacting for thinking I should end this because my wife hasn't apologized and  has no respect for me ?",4,1734206356.0,amiwrong,2,0.83,False
1heb227,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sakartvelo/comments/1heb227/beggars_vendors_and_the_dominance_of_religion/,"Beggars, vendors and the dominance of religion.","On the sore subject.

I came to Georgia in March of this year, after a series of searches and detentions (I am from Russia). Over the past six months, I have been able to find a state of inner peace, when you do not jump up at every rustle near the front door, expecting the security forces.

I can say that Georgia is an amazing country in terms of freedom, at least compared to Russia, I hope that it will remain so. Despite this, I began to notice that I cannot say that I like Georgia.

Why? There are a number of reasons for this:

1) Begging in aggressive forms, in the metro, at markets, in shopping centers. I am fine with those who beg, but when they come up to you and start asking for something under the plausible pretext of ""I am from the ""N"" fund and I am collecting money for \[something there\]"" - they show an ID printed on a color printer. Yes, this is pure fraud, who is it aimed at? Or, for example, when someone sits in a crowded place and loudly moans - it seems that you are not in the 21st century, but somewhere in a plague city of the Middle Ages. It is even worse when a man of 30-40 years old, with pronounced muscles, but in a state of alcoholic intoxication asks for alms, starting to shake a metal mug with small change, when you pass by - has he not tried working, not drinking?

2) Aggressive sales. I will give an example from today. On the way to the post office, I got off the metro at the station square, on the way I decided to drink coffee. I am standing waiting for coffee, when a man comes up to me and starts offering electric razors. I answer him ""I don't need this"" in Georgian and Russian. He continues to try to sell me his junk, now speaking Russian - so I rudely replied, ""Get away from me - I'm not interested in your goods. If I want to buy something, I go to a store - the salespeople don't bother me there, and when I buy, I get a receipt and a guarantee for the goods."" To which the salesman says, ""Why are you being so rude? I calmly approached you and asked if you wanted to buy..."" To which I reply, ""First, I calmly answered you in Russian and Georgian that I'm not interested, you didn't get it the first time."" Not a minute has passed when a second salesman comes up to me with his perfume and offers me in Russian to ""smell the aromas."" Well, at this point I realize that this is probably some kind of local trolling and I just ignore him. I can't ignore him - he's practically sticking his nose in. So I say to him, ""Entschuldigen Sie bitte, sprechen Sie Deutsch?"" (I know German quite well) he tells me ""But you speak Russian"" I shake my head, smile and say ""Entschuldigung, aber ich verstehe dich nicht"" then they give me coffee and I retreat.

3) When you get to know a Georgian well, especially of the older generation, disregard for personal life comes to the fore when they persistently try to matchmake you with someone. Do Georgians even have a concept of ""Private Personal Life""?

=== The previous three points are all a violation of personal space, as I just generalized for myself ===

4) Disgusting scientific and technical base for hobbies and creativity. The assortment of local radio shops is extremely meager, and many things are sold with an incredible markup of 100% of the retail (Yes, not wholesale, but retail!) cost in other countries. (3D printers, CNC, fiber optic lasers) And many things are simply impossible to get, except on AliExpress or by ordering from Russia (stepper motors / ferric chloride / photoresist / solder mask). But +100500 church shops and currency exchangers. It seems that Georgia has no scientific and technological progress, but there is an export of church grace freely convertible into euros and dollars. Well, and a high turnover of wax - candles need to be made from something.

With all this, somewhere under the cloth is a technical college - it seems like there is something to show the world (I have a friend studying there and I know a couple of interesting projects), but again, it is not the college that is in sight, but wax, God's grace and currency exchangers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

How do the locals cope with attempts to aggressively sell them something or beggars? I have a way, but it's not very pleasant - dress in old clothes and go unshaven - then they won't bother you, but you can't go around like that all the time...

So how do Georgians themselves feel about this behavior of their fellow citizens? Do they find it normal or outrageous? 

One Georgian friend told me that it wasn't always like this - is that really true?",0,1734206323.0,Sakartvelo,0,0.33,False

Maybe you lived in an antique neighborhood with picturesque little houses and Victorian Mansions. Me I live in a war neighborhood. It is boring and I love it. Built before the war; well directly before America entered WWII. The neighborhood was “designed to support aerospace” the Realtor said. Aerospace at the time was the bomb and rocket factory. The houses are quaint and small. They hadn’t invented the term tiny yet. 

Most of my neighbors have two bedrooms one bathroom and a common room plan that was too small for anything to be called “Great”. But my house was special. You see when they built my house they bought two lots both small but together you could make something. And after the war they did. My house expanded adding a sunny and grand living room and an attached garage with a small second story. My house is only smallish.

We moved here for the schools. There is a fantastic high school only a few blocks away, walking distance. And they call the neighborhood “affordable”. It isn’t, but everyone calls it that.



So my son wanted to move upstairs during his sophomore year. When we moved in, he wanted to be downstairs for more independence.

“Sure but why the sudden move.”  
“Dad, the house is haunted.”  
“Preposterous the house is too new to be haunted. The old lady across the street has known everyone who lived in this house.”  
“She is old as dirt and maybe senile” he said.  
“No!”

Admittedly they were still prototyping rocks at when she moved into the neighborhood.

“She says no one ever died in or near the house and no one who lived there was depressed enough or mean enough to haunt it.”  
“It’s still haunted, Dad!”  
“Have you seen any ghosts?”  
“No”  
“Have they talked to you?”  
“No”  
“So how do you know?”  
“I hear them. They make noises.”  
“Damn! We probably have rats.”

So goes the saga of moving his stuff upstairs, but hey our Work from Home Office is next to the kitchen. So much closer to the coffee.



Ah but now he is off to college. Living in a brownstone that is definitely haunted with four roommates. There is even an article in the newspaper about it. Granted the article was from 1872 so maybe the ghosts moved on. He seems quite unbothered.



“We should get a dog!” the wife says.  
“We are still mourning the last dog!”  
“It has been over 4 years. We haven’t had a dog in this house.  
With the boy in college I miss the pitter patter of little feet.  
We can get a rescue and avoid the puppy phase.”

With our genes the “pitter patter” sounded more like a Clydesdale learning to tap dance to pornographic Rap music.

“Ok.”

We adore corgis and they are smart, cute and can’t jump the fence.

“See!  We could adopt this one she is a rescue.”

“She might not be potty trained. Many rescues aren’t.” says the adoption lady.

We are in luck, well mostly. She is potty trained. At least during the day.



*Thump, Thump Thumpity thump.*

There we were watching a movie in the sun room. Did I mention the sun room? Sometime in the 1960s someone added a sun room. Not one of those attach a tin garden shed to you house things but a proper room but with a flat roof tucked under the eaves of the house. This seems to be the source of our problem. The roof is flat enough to stand on. I have done it while cleaning the gutters.

“We need a camera.” says the wife.

Yes she is ""the wife"". Always ""the wife"". Even my friends refer to her as ""the wife"".

“A camera?”  
“Yes! A camera for the roof.”  
“For the roof?”  
“The dog is scared of whatever is on the roof. If we had a camera we could see it. They have speakers and sirens now. We could scare it off. The dog would potty outside at night. Aren’t you tired of cleaning up?”  
“It’s a squirrel.”  
“Squirrels aren’t nocturnal and it sounds way too big anyway.”  
“It is probably a rat then or the neighbor’s cat chasing a rat.”  
“Be that as it may, the dog is scared to go out in the dark.”  
“We have lights.”  
“She is still scared. You can install the camera while I am at my sister’s. She is ill and needs help.”

Yeah her sister needs help alright. So does my sister. They both are “ill”. But the wife has spoken and electronics and outdoors is my jurisdiction so I had better hop to it. Her jurisdiction is emergency birthday cakes and IRS audits. I think I have the better end of the deal.



Today I have a camera. It is quite fancy. Express shipping when you really wanted it here yesterday but can wait two days. It is solar and has a speaker with a siren and AI motion detection built in. Wow! It is even does color at night. I have out done myself.

So here I sit. Me and the dog. We are watching another movie.



*Thumpity thump, Thump, Thump.*

**Bing.**  
**Animal Detected on the roof.**

I have you now. Let’s see how you like me talking to you roof rat.  
I pop open the app on my phone.



It isn’t a rat.  
And it isn’t the neighbor’s cat.  
But it is eating a rat.  
And posing for “selfies”.

I'm particularly interested in weightlifting, chess, reading, anime, archery, guitar, finance and programming. If you have recommendations for clubs, or cool events worth checking out, lemme know.

1heat4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1heat4l/a_massive_menagerie_of_perfume_reviews/,A Massive Menagerie of Perfume Reviews,"Hello hello! Prepare for a LONG post as I review all of the lovely perfumes gifted to me by the even more lovely u/KairixFrenzy! I had so much to say that I figured I would make a separate post, since it's been a hot sec since I actually received all of these. 

  
Onward with the reviews!!!

**Full Sizes**

Lush - Grass *(fresh cut grass, neroli, violet, sandalwood)*

* Despite this fragrance containing violet notes, I think I…like it??? I don’t have much experience with Lush, so any perfumes from them are completely new to me. Grass is definitely a scent I’d much prefer to be on me when I’m spending hours outside in the spring sunshine, rather than inside during the winter. It’s quite strong. The grass and neroli blend nicely, and the violet doesn’t dominate except during the drydown. Grass is definitely a fragrance I want to wear more in the summer!



Pineward - Shire *(hay, oatmeal, hazelnut, bergamot, lavender, herbal tea, westfarthing leaf (tobacco), seed cake, jasmine, orris, and honey)*

* I got a sample of Shire from a Pineward order before the exchange and became obsessed with it. I couldn’t stop thinking about it; seriously, it was an issue LOL. Of course, the full size didn’t disappoint. Shire is a light, sweetgrass-forward fragrance that makes you think of meadows changing with the seasons; from the crisp wheat ready for harvest in the fall to the freshly-sprouted sprigs of hay in the spring, Shire is the epitome of seasonal nostalgia for simple meadows and old friends. Does that make sense??? I don’t know! But I LOVE IT.



ObscuraHortus - The Billion Ghosts Awandering *(oak moss, black tea, blackest oud, vanilla, marshmallow and smoke)*

* Ghosts is a light and spooky marshmallow-forward oil with the slightest hint of tea and smoke in the background. It’s gotten spicier with rest. It’s easy to wear and not too sweet, as the oak moss and other notes balance out the marshmallow. This was a surprise FS and it’s definitely up my alley, since I just ran out of my main marshmallow perfume! 



ObscuraHortus - Ochre & Fire *(caramel, clove, patchouli, jasmine)*

* I wasn’t sold on this one at first sniff, since it contains two notes I tend to dislike: clove and patchouli. However! This perfume, with rest, is definitely more caramel and jasmine-dominant, with the clove and patchouli hanging in the background and playing nicely. Ochre & Fire, to me, feels like one aspect of fall; it’s the first hint of spiced caramel baked goods and bonfires in late October. Perhaps it’s similar to Shire, in that it evokes a sort of seasonal nostalgia that may be ephemeral, but no less powerful in its beauty.



**Samples**

ParanormalPerfumes - Malum Malus *(apple brandy, oak barrels, caramel, pear flower, pineapple spritz, apple orchard wood, juniper, cardamom, incense & myrrh)*

* The notes of Malum Malus make it seem like it’s my vibe. It’s woody, slightly fruity, and darkened with cardamom and myrrh. I really, really wanted to like this! But on my skin, Malum Malus is mostly grungy. It’s alcoholic and woody with a slight bitterness from the apple and pineapple. There’s a consistent booziness that just isn’t my vibe, even though I loooove boozy openings. I like the idea of Malum Malus based on the notes, but I don’t think it’s something I’ll reach for often. 10/10 for the super interesting notes though!



ParanormalPerfumes - Blood & Silk *(almond milk, vanilla, ambrette, black cherry liqueur, floral musk, tonka, blood accord)*

* Unlike Malum Malus, Blood & Silk did NOT seem like a fragrance I'd enjoy. I was totally wrong! The cherry liqueur is a constant, bringing a juicy fruitiness to the smooth, creamy almond milk and tonka. The blood accord/metallicness is missing in action, unfortunately, but nevertheless, Blood & Silk is a wearable cherry perfume that makes me wonder about some other popular cherries (Cherries of the Night and Fuckery, anyone?)



Sorce - String of Lights in the Forest *(vanilla milkshake, haitian vetiver, lavender maillette, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, ambroxan)*

* If I had to make a list of the top three winners of this exchange, String of Lights would be one of the three. I was very, very surprised. u/KairixFrenzy can attest to my initial wariness around SoL, because the notes make it seem too sweet. But SoL is not too sweet at all; in fact, it’s a bubbly vanilla animalic that smells like you’re sharing a milkshake with a hottie on a summer night at a 1950s-themed queer diner. I want it on me. All. Day.



Pineward - Caravansary *(fir balsam, deer musk (botanic accord), vanilla, black tea, lavender, blue spruce, blue chamomile, treemoss, incense, mulched pinecone, campfire smoke)*

* I knew I would like this, but I had no idea I would want to fullsize it so quickly! Caravansary is a herbal, woodsy, and sweet animalic. It makes me envision a Christmas celebration that takes place before the commercialization of the holidays (if such a time even existed), where family and friends gathered by a fresh evergreen tree to share stories, cups of tea, and warm furs. It doesn’t change much in the drydown. Caravansary is lovely and has great longevity!



Pineward - Hayloft *(hay, lavender honey, crocus, sweet vernalgrass, bison grass, toasted almond, hazelnut, oats, dusty wheat)*

* I figured I would like this a lot, since I enjoy Shire. After all, Shire came from a vision to make Hayloft lighter and more sweetgrass-centric. Hayloft, however, is just okay. I think the hay, combined with the sweetness of the lavender honey, makes the fragrance overall a bit too sweet and pungent for me. It’s quite “heavy” for having lighter, herbal notes, and I think the heaviness is definitely rooted in the honey. I am for sure going to use up my sample, but I wouldn’t FS.



Pineward - Autumnal *(peppermint, cinnamon, alfalfa, maté, nettle leaf, beeswax, bran, deerstongue, chamomile, fir needles, wheat, oakwood)*

* Hello, eternal longevity! It’s me, a guy who would like to change fragrances daily instead of weekly. Autumnal is lovely in its own right, despite having one of my least favorite notes: the elusive cinnamon. Autumnal smells like decaying leaves and peppermint tea, which makes it charming—albeit limited by the season. The longevity is insane, so don’t expect to wear anything else for at least 3 days after one spray of Autumnal. I will definitely use this, although not as quickly as I’ve used Caravansary!



Pineward - Mint Cocoa *(peppermint, chocolate, vanilla, malt powder, cream, cedar, resins, spices, patchouli)*

* This is a wonderful minty cocoa scent, actually. I like the artistry behind it! It kind of reminds me of Olympic Orchids’ Seattle Chocolate, in that it’s actually chocolate and not just sugar. I’m not sure how much I’ll wear this outside of the 2 weeks in December before Christmas, but it’s really nice all the same!



Alkemia - Of Bronze & Blaze *(bronze amber, cognac barrels, red oak leaf, perique tobacco, pumpkin, opoponax, soft suede, creamy steamy vanilla coffee)*

* This is definitely a winner! At first sniff, Of Bronze & Blaze is sweet, woody cognac that is made slightly spicy by unsmoked tobacco. It is creamy and sweet with a spicy tobacco kick! As it dries down, I can smell hints of the sweet vanilla coffee and the smooth, earthy suede. It’s a comforting and warm scent that envelops you like the welcoming atmosphere of your favorite bar that just so happens to double as an espresso bar.



Amorphous - Ethervelvet *(oakmoss, amber, frankincense, lavender, vetiver, orchid, blood cedar, leather, and pineapple)*

* u/KairixFrenzy said this smells like the backrooms, and I definitely agree. There’s something disturbing and liminal about this one. It smells like everything and nothing, all at once. It smells like all of the listed notes, and yet I can’t pick them out at all. It scares me a little, to be honest. But it’s definitely an interesting experience that I’m glad I had the opportunity to embrace!



Amorphous - Snow Angel *(cedar, cranberry, fig, leaves, neroli, peppermint, pine needle, plum)*

* I had an interesting experience with Snow Angel. When I first smelled it, I figured I could like it. However, as it rested, it became scary and aggressive. The cranberry, neroli, peppermint, and pine, when combined, create one of the most aggressively cold, in your face perfumes I’ve ever smelled. I don’t know if I can get myself to wear this one, even though the notes make it sound so good! 



Haus of Gloi - Haus Amber *(Rich and sultry amber, our own hand blended accord)*

* I like amber when it’s with a bunch of other notes, but Haus Amber made me feel nauseous. It was too dusty and salty to my nose. Maybe it could work as a layering note.



Haus of Gloi - Depravity *(clove, nutmeg and coconut, on a bed of rich golden amber, sandalwood and spilled wine)*

* I wanted to like Depravity, but the notes listed did not align with my olfactory experience (again). I refuse to give up on HoG as a house, but I’m getting the sense that we just don’t jive. In Depravity, I smelled vague coconut, and maybe a hint of clove if I was lucky, and that was it. The scent disappeared after about five minutes, too :(



Haus of Gloi - Honeysuckle Incense *(heady honeysuckle incense swirling with nag champa and dragon's blood)*

* It was at this point that I realized that Haus of Gloi maybe isn’t for me. I haven’t given up entirely, since I placed an order for a few samples, but I have no idea how that will turn out. Honeysuckle Incense is all incense on me. It’s very heavy and smoky in a way that I do not enjoy :(



Crow & Pebble - Father Frost (*Bitter cold wind howling through a dense silver birch and pine wood, withstood only with the help of a hot mug of lapsang souchong tea and a pot of redcurrant jelly)*

* This was a sniffie included in my exchange package, and it’s very lovely! It’s cold and woody, but the redcurrant jelly adds a bit of warmth and fruitiness to what would otherwise be a scarily cold fragrance a la Snow Angel.



Siren Song Elixirs - Ascension *(spiced brandy, bergamot, rosemary, lavender, amber, incense, black pepper)*

* Similar to Of Bronze & Blaze, Ascension opens with a sweet and spicy alcoholic note. Rather than taking the sweet route, Ascension dries down to black pepper and an herbal rosemary. Strangely enough, I had been eyeing The Pale Elf from SSE, and so I feel like Ascension was a good way to figure out if I wanted Astarion…as a friend, of course. Just kidding, I want him carnally.  



Treading Water - Fig Wasp *(fig, bergamot, fresh cut grass, guaiacwood, oakmoss)*

* I haven’t properly tried Fig Wasp, but I do enjoy the taste and smell of figs! From what I’ve smelled so far, Fig Wasp is half green, half fruit. It’s slightly creamy and quite smooth, so I’m eager to test this one in full! 



Treading Water - Nolendorf Lounge *(peach cocktail, immortelle, maple, vanilla, wood bartops)*

* Nolendorf Lounge turns to just alcohol on my skin :( It’s fairly linear, meaning that the other notes of peach and immortelle feel missing in action. Maybe they’re so well-blended that my nose can’t distinguish them?



Treading Water - The Observer *(violet, incense, black pepper, vanilla, oakmoss, sandalwood)*

* I…surprisingly love this. I am NOT a violet person. Violets, as lovely as they are, scare me due to their pungency. But The Observer is truly a masterpiece. It reminds me of a somewhat moody, queer vibe at a quiet cafe near closing time. You’re alone in the corner, sipping your drink and reading queer literature as the snow outside begins to stick to the sidewalks and the sun sets. The world outside may be cold, but as you glance up from your book to see two young men holding hands under the table in the corner across from you, a sense of comfort settles in your chest. Inside this cafe is peace, safety, and refuge for you and others like you. The lights dim. Your time at the cafe is running out, but as you step out into the street–a purple glow casting itself upon you and the cobblestone streets beneath your boots–you will carry the comfort it provided with you.



Damask Haus - Crown Shy (*purple hyssop, sweet resins, forest moss, rosewood, teakwood, guaiacwood)*

* I have no idea. I will get back to this one! 



So there we go! An (almost) complete anthology of 2024 Fall Exchange reviews! I want to thank u/KairixFrenzy ENDLESSLY for not only providing me with a wonderful menagerie of scents that spawned new favorites for me, but for also being such a sweet and lovely friend. In fact, we’re in the middle of doing ANOTHER exchange for the winter!!! :D

It’s been a long time coming, I’m excited to finally experience one.

Since I’m new to this, I’d love to hear some advice or insights from those of you who’ve attended cuppings before. How do these usually go? Should I prepare anything in advance, like learning how to use a cupping form, or is that not something I should worry about?

I’m also a bit nervous about the social side of things. I’ve always been on the shy side, so I’m not the best at striking up conversations. Any tips for navigating that would be super helpful!

Would love to hear your thoughts or any advice you wish you had for your first cupping experience.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I’ve been doing that for about year now and sometimes skipped the afternoon coffee with a zero sugar sprite or Gatorade, but yesterday I just had this feeling of burnout that I haven’t experienced in a long time and I noticed that the jitters I was feeling weren’t helping me at all. So I quit as of last night as was ready to experience the mental fog, the headache, and he withdrawal, but it’s now mid-afternoon and I’m… fine?  Like, maybe a little heaviness when I walk around, but I’m not having nearly as bad a time as I did before. I’m wondering if the ~200mg of caffeine I’d been on before was less than I was drinking before, but I’m able to get my work done, made my lunch, and have just been drinking flavored water with no noticeable pain or lethargy.

1heaftv,https://i.redd.it/j9r9c1wr8v6e1.jpeg,Great Decaf,"Before the AeroPress I’ve always thought decaf was bad, and couldn’t be good. But I’ve learned that is not that case. The true key is finding a good roaster, as it’s sometimes harder to find decaf beans that roasters put some love into! But if you do, it can be wonderful. 

The pictured bag was a bonus bag as part of the Decaf Project that James Hoffman is running. I’m not sure if they have it in stock still or not, however there are plenty of good decaf options found here on Reddit. 

My method is pretty much James’ AeroPress method as well, as I’ve found that to give me the most consistent results with all my coffees. But to break down how I’ve tweaked it for my decaf:

- 17g coffee, medium/medium coarse grind
- 270g water
- Heat water to 90 C
- Use standard cap and paper filter, wet filter with hot tap water
- Start timer and pour all 270g of water in about 30 seconds
- plug the opening with the plunger to seal and stop dripping, let it steep.
- At 1:30, gently give the setup one or two swirls. Let set 30 seconds
- At 2:00, gently push the plunger. I take around 30 seconds to get to hiss. 

Obviously your tastes and mileage may vary, but so far this has been a good method for me and usually I only have to mess with water ratio and/or steep time. I’d highly recommend using the coffee compass found here as well, to tweak to your liking. https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-coffee-compass/

Equipment I am using:

Chemex
1zpresso K-Ultra
Timemore Kettle

Honestly, I’m not entirely sure if my cups are over extracted or under extracted, but it’s definitely one of those. I would say that my cups taste acidic and bitter. 

I’ve tried different temperatures for the water, different grind size, different ratios of coffee to water, and I still get the same result. 

At first, I thought maybe it was the Ethiopian beans. But then I tried some cheap Costco coffee and had the same results. And then more recently I tried a completely different type of coffee and again had the same result. 

I definitely think the Chemex is difficult to use. The drawdown time is generally pretty long. I know the drawdown can be long with Ethiopian but it seems like even with other coffee beans it’s also long. My first poor is pretty terrible. My second poor is very tea like. And a little better. But not full.

I’ve tried:

20mg to 300ml water. 
40mg to 600ml water. 
10 all the way to 3.5 for grind. 

I’m following the appropriate pattern, allowing the bloom, and staggering my subsequent pours. I feel like I’ve messed around with enough of the variables that I still can’t figure out exactly what is the issue.

Symptoms seem to mirror both OpenVPN and WireGuard VPN.

  


When connected to VPN on internal networking I see \~300 Mbit with 10-15% CPU usage (i3-N305) when transferring files to my home server. Unnecessary to be on the VPN when at home. But can use that as a metric of possibility. I think the device I was using seeing 300Mbit was Wireless AX connected with a speed/signal at \~900Mbit. Wish it was faster but just stating I have seen 300+Mbit through the VPN tunnel I made with OpenVPN.



When on the WAN (coffee shop as an example) and using the VPN to access WAN services (essentially proxying through OPNsense back to the internet with VPN) I see 300+ Mbit, but usually starts at \~100Mbit and ramps up over the next 10 seconds, so not like full throttle connection until \~10 second later. Not sure if that's the limit of the networking/WiFi I was using while remote.



Problem: When I VPN and transfer files to my home server inside my home network, I see 30-40Mbit on a 200+ Mbit connection. I have opened up a port temporarily for iperf and see the same performance with that without VPN to the internal server (wired, 5Gbit aggregated between 2x2.5Gbit connections), and that symptom persists no matter the WAN source. I was travelling, and at a nearby coffee shop.... testing with my phone and my laptop, same limited transfer speeds.



When transferring internal wired networking to this server I can transfer files 3+Gbit.



What in OPNsense is causing WAN bound connections to internal networks to throttle so hard? Is there an IPS service running by default? Anyone see this before? Seems to be WAN, inward, as throttling.",1,1734203867.0,opnsense,0,1.0,False

We're staying in the Warehouse District. Four of us travel a lot together and are very driven by food/coffee/drinking. For this trip we've decided to not overbook on food, the only reservations we have are at Seaworthy, Peche, N7 and Jewel. 

Other restaurants that are on our (at least my) must-hit list are Saba, Turkey and the Wolf and Dakar.

Will be doing the Whitney Plantation, WWII and the Oaks light tour thingy. We will sometimes be together but likely splitting up a lot as well.

I always like to gather some specific questions after I've done all my research and would love any recommendations/thoughts from locals or those familiar with the town :-) 

1. Planning on heading over to Camellia Grill and Snake and Jake's Christmas Club Lounge at some point but don't have a ton marked in that area aside from Blue Cyprus Books, any other must-visits. How would you spend a day in that area, assuming we start at Camellia and end at Jake's?
2. Who pours the best pint of Guinness in town?
3. Besides the usual suspects like Magazine St, any absolute favorite stretches for a long walk with lots of shops? Bookstores, gift, etc.
4. Not a breakfast person myself but looooove pastries of any kind. Will of course be trying beignets but curious about the best pastries - specifically cake donuts and croissants - in the city.
5. Any must-dos that you recommend for first time visitors? Something that exemplifies the city? We aren't into super touristy stuff and won't be doing any tours but will definitely do some cemetery visits - I did think maybe a tarot reading could be fun? I'm always down for something cheesy if it's fun.
6. We will be renting a car and heading out to the Whitney Plantation one day, any must-visit places to eat along the way?
7. I know the town has a very specific coffee culture that I am looking forward to exploring, but I am also curious if any third wave coffee has hit? I typically drink espresso, who pulls great shots?
8. Any great artist cooperatives? Spaces where multiple artists open their studios or purchase artwork.
9. I know I'm an asshole for asking this but...is there any good sushi in town?
10. Not really worried about finding places to drink in town (we have a gazillions places marked)....but, if you had to recommend ONE bar (any kind/style), which would it be??

1hea37u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptozoology/comments/1hea37u/more_on_the_deepstar_2000_cryptid_fish_encounter/,"More on the Deepstar 2000 Cryptid Fish Encounter (from Skin Diver magazine, March 1967)","I decided to track down the *Skin Diver* magazine that featured the Deepstar encounter article mentioned in another Reddit post here.  As it turns out, only one of the 3-person crew saw the fish—Joe Thompson.

As he says in the article, “I’ve spent many years at sea, am familiar with all the ordinary sea creatures, and I know that a \[sea\] bass wouldn’t be sighted at 4000 feet \[down\].”

They were taking current speed and temperature readings during the descent, as well as at the targeted ocean bottom point in the San Diego Trough.  At the bottom the instrumentation was like on an instrument pallet, which was detached, and then the submersible backed off about 20 feet.  There were wires from the instrumentation pallet that connected directly to the bathyscaphe and readings were recorded by Dr. E.D. LaFond.  The photos on the fourth page of the article show the pallet.

About 15 minutes after the beginning of the readings on the ocean bottom was when the creature encounter happened.

Thompson’s direct comments:

a)—eye was about five to seven inches in diameter;

b)—a split second later Thompson saw the gill plate cover and a “two-foot long pectoral fin directly behind it”;

c)—color was mottled brown with grayish white tipping on the fin, scales and tail;

d)—the fish was “covered with scales; the largest were toward the front and were about the size of a coffee cup”;

e)—the fish had approached Deepstar from the front port side of the vehicle, “avoiding the brightly lighted front area where our lights were focused” as well as “It passed within eight feet of the port side of the Deepstar where only I could see it.”;

f)—visual impact was “one of watching a long, speeding freight train” and “row after row of scales pass\[ed\] by.”;

g)—As the fish passed, “I was able to catch a good view of its thick tail.  In its huge proportion, it was very strange looking, with ragged caudals jutting off its end on a 30 degree angle.  It was not the tail of a sea bass or shark, but prehistoric in appearance.”;

h)—The tail reminded Thompson of “an illustration of a coelacanth’s tail that I had seen in an ocean science book.”

i)—Despite his urge to chase after the fish, Thompson remained focused on the scientific mission, and stayed on point.  If they had attempted to go after it, the wires between the pallet and the bathyscaphe would have ripped off.

j)--Like in the 1965 Alvin case (Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas), the camera equipment were in a fixed position facing to the front, and couldn't be altered to photograph the creature which was coming from a side angle.

 

I attach all the pages of the article for everyone’s reading.  It was definitely an anomalous fish.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 24th, 2136*

I wasn’t the biggest connoisseur of shopping trips. I only really did them out of necessity. Or, in this case, being invited by a particular Gojid.

As I was waiting outside the door I just knocked on, a Venlil emerged on the other end of the hallway. They had several bags in each arm, as though they *really* didn’t want to make two trips to the car, and their whole body sagged like they would collapse at any second. They spotted me and immediately froze.

For my want of an authentic shopping experience, I’d opted to leave my mask on my kitchen counter. Knowing it was too late to change my mind, I waved a friendly hand.

They flinched, of course, but it at least seemed to shake them from their frozen stupor. They took weary steps forward, likely a combination of my influence on their amygdala and the influence of gravity on those bags they were carrying.

“Need some help with those?” I said.

“Don’t! I-I’m fine!” the Venlil replied, nearly gasping for air.

I shrugged, turning back to the door in front of me. Bemlin was taking his sweet time. I briefly wondered if Gojids did their spines like humans did our hair. *We have bad hair days, do they have bad spine days? My first days on this planet were definitely bad spine days. Some still are if I don’t keep my posture, or skip my yoga routine, or learn a particularly grating piece of news. Would Bemlin like yoga?*

A stifled *oof* shook me from my thoughts. The Venlil had fallen down, rather unfortunately. Their noseless snout was buried in the thin carpet of the floor, tail pointing straight up, their body splayed out like a bizarre modern performance piece. The cause of the faceplant was likely their preoccupied limbs which had managed to dump some of the contents of their bags onto their head, adding an artistic splash of color to really complete the scene.

“You sure you don’t need any help?”

Their reply was another noise of some kind. I walked over and helped to free one of their arms from the prison of bags, and they were up soon enough. I was rewarded with them looking at me like I was crazy.

“Trying to make it all in a single trip? Trust me, I’ve been there,” I said, turning my attention to some of the items that had spilled. There were some scattered food items which looked weirdly familiar in that strange alien way.

“I-I… um…?” said the Venlil. They sounded more confused than frightened now, which was a step up at least.

My eyes settled on a jar, and curiosity compelled me to pick it up. The logo had some kind of tractor with an orange sun behind it, but what interested me more was the murky liquid it contained. There were some odd shapes floating around in it.

“You guys pickle stuff?” I said.

They tilted their head in a way that could’ve been considered cute. “Y-You… pickles?”

“Me. Pickles,” I agreed, inspecting the jar a little more closely. “Are they fermented? Nothing beats acid and salt, right?”

“It’s a-alcohol.”

I nearly burst into a toothy grin before catching myself. “That’s amazing. Alcoholic pickles. Wait, does the fermentation process produce alcohol, or is it just added in later?”

The bewildered Venlil blinked several times before responding. “It’s, um, all alcohol. I-I think.”

“As a snack? Or something more recreational?”

“I-I bring them to work.”

I raised an incredulous eyebrow at the jar of pickled… things. *This is a day snack? What’s the alcohol content of this? Maybe this is why aliens are insane. But that makes me wonder what kind of yeast they use. Alien yeast… Were the Venlil the ones with strong liquor? I wonder if brewers are learning anything useful from this mess.*

Somewhere behind me, a door clicked shut. I turned to see Bemlin, who apparently *finally* made it out of his apartment, minutes after I’d knocked. He took one look at the scene and opened his mouth to speak, but I beat him to it.

“Did you know about alcoholic pickles?” I asked, wiggling the jar in my hand.

“What did I walk into?” the Gojid responded.

I blinked. “Oh, right.” I gave the jar back to the Venlil, who gingerly took it. I helped them with the rest of the spilled items, and Bemlin came over too. It turned out they lived just down the hall.

“Alcoholic pickles?” asked Bemlin once they’d gotten all their bags into their apartment.

“What took you so long? I knocked like, five minutes ago.”

“You’re early. I was finishing trimming my claws. Why was the Venlil on the floor?” To his credit, his claws did look exemplary.

“I think it had more to do with the number of bags they were carrying than anything I did. But yes, alcoholic pickles. You ever hear about them?”

“Not pickles specifically, but I know the Venlil are quite inventive when it comes to, er, inebriation methodology. They are somewhat well-known for that biological quirk.”

The Venlil textbooks and info dumps I’d spent sleepless nights translating back on Earth came flooding back. I remembered finding their metabolism immensely interesting (aside from the fact that they were *real aliens*), but hadn’t thought about other species. “What’s your alcohol tolerance like?” I asked Bemlin.

He waved a claw. “I am no lightweight, if that’s what you’re asking.”

I chuckled. “We can judge that later. Are you ready?”

“Yes. Let the Christmas shopping commence.”

–

I’d never been to an innocuously named “Human Store” before. Not one on an alien planet, anyways. I was expecting an experience similar to traveling to a foreign country and visiting a gift shop. You’d see things you were used to, but there was just something subtly off about how they were presented, as if they were trying too hard to get you to buy things.

That was not the case for the store Bemlin took me to. We walked in and were immediately graced by the sickly sweet tune playing on the store’s overhead. Bemlin wandered inside without a care in the world, while my legs were frozen solid by the timeless voice of Mariah Carey.

It was a small store, but not to its detriment. The air was light and somehow cheery, and the multicolored lights dotted around the place gave it a remarkably homey feel. It captured that horrible feeling of Christmas shopping while still being warm and welcoming—an incredibly needed breath of fresh air from everything I’d come to hate about the galaxy. If my back didn’t have that dull ache, I’d believe I was on Earth.

“Is something wrong?” Bemlin asked.

“Who owns this place?” I responded, walking towards a brightly colored aisle on autopilot. *Autopilot? This place doesn't belong on this planet*. “This is weirdly surreal.”

“A Venlil, I believe, but their workforce is almost entirely humans.”

I shuddered. Even on an alien planet one couldn't escape the imminent reality of retail. “That’s… interesting. What do you think about this place?”

His eyes lit up. “It's lovely here. It is the ideal location to spend money on somewhat useless and mostly nonsensical merchandise that you supposedly only pay attention to once a year. And the music! I had no idea a human voice could reach such an energetic high.”

I wasn’t sure if I should frown or something else. This was Bemlin’s first experience with the holly and the jolly, and it reminded me of a time where it was something more than an annual period of unceasing consumerism that corporations loved to shill.

There were a few people milling about. Some Venlil, but mostly other humans. *Probably refugees*, I darkly thought. On the bright side, this store was probably a good distraction… or maybe a bleak reminder. *I should stop thinking so hard about this.*

The main attraction was very obviously the festive aisle. I followed Bemlin into it.

“What is this?” said the Gojid, raising a box to show me. “I saw it the last time I came here.”

I smiled. “A fake mini-snowman kit. I guess that makes sense, you can’t have snow on this planet without being absolutely miserable.”

“An anthropomorphic sculpture made of frozen water,” Bemlin pondered. “Is this a common pastime in communities based near the poles of Earth?”

“Sometimes. If you get the right kind of snow, you can make a big ball and stack it on top of another, bigger snow ball. Give it a hat and stick arms and you’ve got a snowman. Although I should mention that that kit isn’t real snow, just some sort of foam.”

He inspected the packaging. “The pupils in its eyes wobble.”

“Googly eyes.”

“It isn’t defective?”

“Nope. Googly eyes are fun.”

“Do you engage in this activity? Building the sculpture?”

“As much as I’ve bounced around the States, I’ve never actually made one. Guess I was too busy, or maybe I had a boring childhood. Or maybe you can blame it on things warming up in the twenty-first century.” I shrugged.

“That will change. We must make a man of fake snow.” He tucked the box into his shopping basket. “There are so many arts and crafts items… Is that season specific?”

“Uh, no? You can go to any hobby store and get anything you can imagine. You can probably get enough supplies at one for ten fake snowmen for the same price.”

His face wrinkled in a way I didn’t often see. “That seems… very inexpensive.”

“Is it? How much do fake snowmen usually go for around these parts?”

“Not nearly this cheap. Especially not with coloring supplies included.”

I frowned, but chalked it up as some weird alien thing. We wandered around the aisle some more. Bemlin kept picking things up and, other than the artsy do-it-yourself items, was particularly intrigued by a net of candy coal. He found the concept of misbehaving children receiving carbon-rich sedimentary rock amusing, and placed a bundle of the candy into his basket.

To my surprise, Bemlin was somewhat of a frivolous spender. In just a few short minutes his basket had accumulated a gingerbread house kit, a handful of candy canes, some hand warmers (why?), a Santa hat, and two snowglobes. I wandered past his growing pile and encountered some lights. A solid 20 feet of Christmas lights with the (sensible) measurement in meters conveniently placed in parentheses and smaller text.

I wanted to smile, but found myself frowning. I wasn’t looking forward to it, but I was also glad I hadn’t done it in my stupidly emotional state last paw. I’d ripped off several bandaids in my lifetime.

“Hey, Bemlin? These are the same lights you got, right?”

He put down a third potential snowglobe and came next to me. “Yes. You caught me.”

I dimly smiled. “Sure enough I did. You said Celso helped you hang them? What do you think of him, by the way?”

Bemlin waved a claw. “For a Yotul, he seems very eager. I can see why you hired him.”

*For a Yotul*. A sour taste formed in my mouth. “Yeah… Uh, you mentioned earlier that you wouldn’t expect a Yotul to be qualified for a position in the lab, and now I’m curious what you meant by that.”

“Their society is primitive,” Bemlin very bluntly said. “I thought they wouldn’t be suitable for high-level work for some time longer. Evidently, I was wrong.”

I slowly nodded. “Why do you think their society is primitive?”

“I will not judge, but you should make an effort to keep yourself up to date with galactic affairs. Put briefly, they were using printing presses a mere twenty years ago. Can you imagine that? While their literacy rates are getting better I’m sure, that cannot happen so quickly. The culture shock must have been immense.”

I guessed that wasn’t a *terrible* point to make, all things considered. “Do you think that would impact what expectations you might set for someone?”

He eyed me. “I suppose it would be hard not to. Is this… about something?”

I pursed my lips. “Well, to put it bluntly, I’ve realized we may have differing views on, uh, what determines a person’s capabilities.”

“Then I suppose it’s a good thing I am not in charge of hiring researchers?” Bemlin said with just the slightest twinge of defensiveness.

“You’re still my friend. I’m just trying to understand, and hopefully help you understand. I’m of the opinion that Leirn’s former place in the Federation was, um, less than ideal.”

“Many truths in the Federation have been revealed. You do not have to be gentle with me, say what you mean to say.”

I was extremely uncomfortable and the feeling was getting worse by the second. Annoyingly, that probably meant I was doing something right. “It’s unreasonable when people make assumptions of other people based on, well, *anything* really, but especially their simple state of existence.”

“This is about Celso?”

“He’s what brought it to my attention, but this is *absolutely not* about Celso. You can probably take a quick look around the Orion Arm and see what I mean.”

His gaze dipped. “I understand that. But, if I may raise a point, would a reasonable person say the same twenty years ago at the start of their uplift? What do you do when an assumption is based on a fact?”

“That’s an unhelpful route to go down. It was surely considered ‘factual’ that humans are bloodthirsty killers a few months ago. Neither you or I are inherently lesser—or more—than anyone else because of our, uh, *ancestors*.”

Bemlin thought for a moment. “Perhaps we have just a simple misunderstanding. I don’t believe Celso is inherently unqualified, I am more… passively surprised. As I said, twenty years is not a long time.”

I debated whether or not to rebuke that. Implicit bias was a terrible creature that never really died. “That’s… fair enough probably. But going forward, it would be better if assumptions could be tempered. Especially if those assumptions lead to comments that could, uh, be interpreted in a negative way.”

“I don’t believe I have made any offensive comments, but I will give this conversation some thought.”

That twinge of defensiveness once again irked me but, for a very first conversation, this went exceedingly well. I let go of a small breath I was holding. “Great. Thanks, Bemlin. I probably don’t say it enough, but I really do appreciate you.”

“The feeling is mutual. I, um…” His voice faltered and he sort of looked away. “Should I get a third sediment orb?”

I snorted. “You mean a snowglobe?”

Bemlin blinked. “That is a much better name, and also answers my question.” The greedy Gojid placed the third into his basket.

“You’re kind of a big spender, you know?”

“I am indulging in the culture,” Bemlin said, waving a dismissive claw. “And making use of my sign-on bonus.”

After he piled some more things into his basket, we finally escaped the jolly aisle. Naturally, the next thing Bemlin wanted to visit was the liquor section.

“Do you have an equivalent to wine? Fruit-based alcohol?” I asked Bemlin after some discussion about the offerings.

“Wine?” He almost looked offended. “Don’t tell me the first thing you look for is wine.”

“Of course not, I just have pickles on the mind. This,” I reached for a six-pack of bottles, “is what I usually get. And ‘usually’ is a strong word; I don’t drink anything other than coffee most of the time.”

“Brightly colored packaging doesn’t do your defense any favors.”

“You’re right, but I don’t care. I prefer to *enjoy* my alcohol, including the morning after. And I also respect my liver, thanks.”

“What have you got there, then?”

I grinned. “*Doctor Sam’s Triple Threat*. If that doesn’t scream hard alcohol to you, I don’t know what does.”

“Developed by a doctor? And what might this ‘triple threat’ be?” he teased.

“Alcohol, synthetics, and inhibitory complexes. And yes, an actual doctor developed the formula. It’s actually a pretty nice piece of biochemical engineering.”

His teasing expression faded, and he came to get a closer look. “Interesting. Is it toxic to a Gojid?”

“It has ethanol in it, so yes. I mean, it has a shielding complex that prevents the *noticeable* effects of acetaldehyde, but it’s still a carcinogen no matter what. Not to mention the synthetic cannabinoids and alkaloids that will probably have some sort of effect. Oh, and the metabolic regulators might be an issue. And you should also take into account any synergistic effects any compounds might have in Gojids specifically.”

He gave me a look. “You make this beverage seem terrible.”

“I’m being safe. It’s great for humans, I should say. The synthetics are tuned for more mild effects while also not building dependence. Instead of getting a spike of euphoria followed by a crash, the metabolic regulators make sure you get a gentle ride back to baseline. You drink a few of these and have a good night, then wake up feeling mellowed out. It’s nice.”

“That does sound pleasant. You know, it seems that humans have far more mind-affecting drugs for recreational use than the rest of the galaxy. I wonder why that is.”

Bemlin had just opened a burning hole of curiosity in my mind. Alien toxicology and pharmacology were topics I had barely touched and still felt overwhelmed by, and there were people insane enough to pursue a career in that kind of stuff. The Federation’s databases were enormous. I could probably find an old contact to ask about initial insights on alien drugs ranging from therapeutics to disease treatment, along with comparing any… undesirable side effects…

*Predator disease.*

Sometimes I regretted thinking. I could feel myself getting annoyed already, and I didn’t want to slip down that path. “I, uh… I should look into that. Later. Um, anyways, you should refrain from drinking this until we get a toxicology check done. You’d *probably* be fine, but still. Funnily enough, I’m sure a Venlil could drink this no problem. From my understanding, they seem to be extremely tolerant to, like, everything.”

“A Venlil could outdrink a Mazic,” Bemlin amusedly said. “But I still need a beverage for the festivities. What is something you recommend? Something that goes with ice.”

“This one’s great,” I said, pulling out a random 94-proof whiskey that was just slightly more expensive than the others. I wasn’t familiar with any sort of whiskey, but if I praised it enough, placebo would probably carry Bemlin’s experience with it. Or maybe he’d just spit it out.

He inspected the bottle. “What is the—”

“Forty-seven percent by volume.”

He placed it into his basket. “Excellent.”

I laughed. “That’s all you needed to know, huh?”

The Gojid waved a dismissive claw. “I am a simple man, occasionally.”

“So what’s the next aisle that will be victim to this voracious geneticist?”

He didn’t hesitate in leading the way. “Potato chips.”

Bemlin knew what he wanted, clearly. I wondered if they had any spicy nacho chips here, then I wondered if they would have any dairy products at all here. *Would Bemlin like cheese? Surely dairy wouldn’t elicit an allergic response in the modified mammalian species. Or would he even approve of it?*

Those types of questions always left a sour taste in my mouth. I couldn’t simply ponder something, it had to lead down a path of questions where the final answer was always “hundreds of years of galactic colonialism and maddening lies”. And it went much, much further than just dairy products; humanity was probably cursed in that respect. The quickest advancements in every kind of science only came under the worst circumstances. At least the UN didn’t choose me for some kind of biological Manhattan Project.

*Why can’t I just enjoy my time away from all this? Any time I even think too much about something…*

Maybe I really did need a break to clear my head. A proper one, not a glorified weekend on an alien planet buying some alcohol I didn’t even really like. Try and enjoy something simple for a while rather than focusing so much on the colossal mess that was the galaxy. *Like that’s possible.*

“Bemlin, how often do you take vacations?” I asked while he contemplated smooth or ruffled chips.

“Not often enough. What about you?”

“Probably the same. You ever get the feeling that you should want a vacation more than you do? Or, like, you’ve become apathetic about it?”

He thought for a moment, slowly placing a bag of ruffled chips into his basket. “I would not describe it as apathy, but perhaps it’s similar enough. Do you wish for more vacation time?”

“I’m… honestly not even sure. I guess two days isn’t really much.”

“There will be more days,” Bemlin lightly said. “Do you feel like you should want more, but don’t? Not quite as excited about the vacation as you might want to be?”

“That’s… almost it. I don’t know, it’s all just a little dull.”

“Recent times have been ample, and you were not prepared for respite.”

“I was kind of prepared. It’s not like anything stopped me from taking a ship to Earth for a few days of celebration and coming back. Normally I’d take a full week off, even two. The only reason I took these days off is… I just felt like I needed to? Like it’s forbidden to work on holidays, or something.”

Bemlin gave me a knowing look. “Work keeps the mind busy.”

That didn’t feel entirely correct, but it still hit a little harder than I would’ve liked. I realized I was just saying words while Bemlin was trying to solve a problem, because of course he was. “Yeah. It does.”

“There will be more days,” he repeated.

I smiled, just. Sometimes it was hard to believe this was the same Gojid that thought I was going to eat him just a few months ago. He wouldn’t have this job if not for me, but I wondered if I would have even taken this job if not for him. Su Hui’s words from so long ago echoed in my head. *Why take this over an easy industry job on Earth?*

On second thought, maybe I was looking forward to some holiday inebriation with Bemlin. I’d only really know how I felt about a short vacation once it ended anyways. I followed the Gojid as he ambled to the next aisle, his basket full of goodies.

1he9vnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1he9vnm/unsolicited_advice_that_helped_me/,Unsolicited advice that helped me ,"I’ve been reading about PCOS for about 3 years and here’s things I’ve learned or that have helped me personally. 

1. Hirsutism (extra body hair)- scientific studies show that applying spearmint oil directly doesn’t have barely any effect on the hair growth you have to ingest spearmint tea to see a great result. And it also helps acne because spearmint helps testosterone. 

Don’t let these companies promote spearmint oil to you check the scientific studies first! 

Laser made my hair growth worse. I can’t remember the specific reason why this happens but also do your research about laser with PCOS. It’s also not permanent like many think. Electrolysis is permanent. If you have the funds try that instead. 

Shaving gives me a 5 o clock shadow but if you don’t want to pluck try a color correcting cream it may help. Or maybe try dedicating a weekend to stay in and waxing as much as you can after those few days then shave what’s not picking up to minimize your shadow and then apply color correcting cream. 

2. Acne- acne comes from within no skin care product with prevent it. Spearmint tea 2 times a day and an inostol supplement may help you. If you start working out and are breaking out it is probably your hormones going crazy from everything being pumped through your body. Sometimes the intense workout will always cause this but even if you do slow weighted training and yoga you may get it because your body is just readjusting. If you do slow weighted workouts you can build muscle faster if you have higher testosterone which could help your insulin resistance over time which will help your PCOS overall. But when you just start and your body is using that testosterone for your muscles you will break out and over time it should settle. I use inostol, spearmint tea, and pimple patches. Keep your skin hydrated and clean and wear sunscreen and when your break out settles a little try an exfoliant of some sort to help your dark spots and dead skin. I use a low grade chemical peel from Sephora. It’s pads you can do every day that keep everything tamed and smooth if you keep up and it helps with aging. 

3. Having a consistent cycle- my cycle always stops when I’m extremely stressed. I have to do a reset and figure out what causing my stress. I try to start walking more. Eating clean not just healthy, get better sleep, and focus on meditating/breathing. 
If you don’t get a period for more than 3 months it’s bad for our body to not shed that lining and can lead to cancer to talk to your doctor and see if you can induce a period with medicine at least for one cycle. 

4. Sleep/caffeine- 
Excessive caffeine can be so bad for us. Try to drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up and if you want to be even better than that add a small amount of apple cider vinegar to it for your gut. Then have your cup of coffee and food. Make it a relaxing morning routine and set yourself up for a good day. Throughout the day I have a huge water bottle. I’m talking half gallon size, that’s cute and has a cross body strap and i fill it up and put electrolytes in it. But not sugary powder like LMNT brand because it has magnesium and potassium in it as well. There’s scientific studies that water actually helps us when we are tired it’s just a delayed response so we don’t notice right away. If your sleep schedule is F’d try to take melatonin with magnesium before bed and make sure you have a clean room or atleast clean dress sheets, good temperature, and if you want to be fancy lavender spray. Don’t use blackout curtains try to sync up with the sun if you can. And try not to have a bunch of bright lights on before bed. If you have dogs try to walk them in the morning in the sunlight right after you drink some water because the vitamin D will help! 

5. Mental Health- 
You’re not crazy. PCOS takes a toll on us in basically every way it can. If you have access to a therapist try it out. If you don’t like it try a different one. If you can’t find one you like or don’t have money/time buy a journal, watch YouTube videos by therapist, meditate for a few minutes ect. A book I love is on Amazon called Dialectical behavioral therapy workbook it’s green. It helped me with my mindset a lot. ",9,1734203126.0,PCOS,6,0.91,False

I had an amazing exchange with Violet (u/chalkpeople). She was so kind and knowledgeable and very patient with shipping delays on my end. 

The packaging was impeccable with gorgeous black and gold tissue paper. She hand-painted the woodland designs on pages describing my goodies. These are so beautiful.

Not only did she send me piles of samples from multiple houses, Violet also hand decanted me samples from her personal collection and sent toys and treats for my dogs and cat, who are enjoying their goodies as only pets can. Other treats included a sample of pumpkin coffee and glass mug, bath products, hazelnut chocolates, a blackberry brooch, a crystal clear dice set with gold numbers and bag, goldstone bracelets (blue and gold), a perfume sample container designed for travel, bath salts, a bookmark, stickers, a copy of Over the Garden Wall and scented wax melts (pineapple and cilantro).

I'll be there from Mon-Thurs this week.

I haven't spent much time in this part of the city, so while I've done some research on possible things to do, I'm looking for some advice on people's favourite things in the area.

Here are some things I'm into/looking for:

- cozy coffee shops where I can get a delicious cookie and do some reading or writing
- places for a quiet solo beer
- rowdier places for a beer where I might be able to meet new people for a chat or maybe even get on a dancefloor
- places to eat that don't break the bank and are accommodating or used to solo diners
- vintage clothing stores
- areas that are just generally nice to walk around

Bonus for places that are queer/poc friendly, and I'm happy to venture a little further out of this area, for example a 30min walk or maybe a 15min transit ride.

1he9s8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1he9s8k/not_so_happy_holidays/,Not so happy holidays,"Back story muna sa childhood ko. Father ko is lasinggero noon, pag nalasing sya nagwawala sasaktan kami bubugbugin kami ng kapatid ko at isang beses nasaktan nya mother ko so lumaban ako simula nun hindi na naulit parang nagtino sya pero kapag may nangyayaring ganun kinabukasan okay na lahat. While yung mother ko never may ginawa para ipagtanggol ako habang nangyayari yun nanunuod lang sya lagi. Halos natigil lang talaga lahat nung nagwawala father ko habang lasing harap harapan kumuha ng kutsilyo kapatid ko at nag attempt maglaslas. Sabi ko ako rin naman ganyan at ilang beses ko na rin triny. Natigil sila pero wala rin naman nangyari pagtapos. Hinding hindi ko makakalimutan nung hinampas ako ng extension at talagang bumakat sa braso ko, pumapasok ako sa school nakikita ng ibang tao pero wala namang pumansin. Kapag may nangyayaring ganun ako yung nabugbog napagalitan nakikita ko sa mata ng ibang tao na kasalanan ko bakit ganun kung ano man ugali ko at ganun daw talaga disiplina. Never ako nakakuha ng comfort kahit kaninong kamag anak or family friends dahil siguro takot sila sa father ko or idc basta ang alam ko laging nakkwento ng parents ko ay mga hindi totoo tungkol sakin at never nila nababanggit ano ginawa nila. One time nag open up ako sa mother ko na hindi ko na kaya yung father ko ayoko na. Ang sagot nya is kwinento nya yung pinagdaanan ng father ko sa pamilya nya at ayaw daw nya masira pamilya namin.

Fast forward, siguro 3 years na natahimik yung mga ganun dahil nga “nagtino” na father ko. Tahimik at peaceful ang buhay ko pero never nawala tension between me and my parents. Parang lagi silang maingat kapag magkakasama kami dahil mainitin ulo ko at mabilis magalit. Recently, this December lang, nag mall kami para ipasyal yung mga pinsan ko. Naiwan sa fast food father ko at mga pinsan ko tapos kami ng mother ko bumili ng coffee. Nagpphone lang ako tapos may message father ko na nawrong send sya sakin, message nya sa ibang babae. Sabi nya “lumabas lang kami kasama anak ko may bibilhin daw sya baka madamay din ako”. Buong araw na yun hindi ako kumikibo tapos sya kausap nang kausap sakin which is hindi naman nya ginagawa. Hinayaan ko lang matapos yung araw na yun kasi may kasama kaming mga bata pero sa loob loob ko gulong gulo ako. Sinabi ko sa mother ko kinabukasan sabi lang nya “sinisimulan ko na papa mo”. Yun lang. Kinabukasan ulit sabi ng friend ko nakita nya sa post ng parents ko okay na ulit. Blinock ko na lang father ko at hindi ko rin binati sa birthday nya. 

Every Christmas nagsisimba kami tapos may reunion kami sa mother side ko and uuwi rin yung mga pinsan ko sa father’s side ko. Sa ngayon nasa isip ko hindi sumama magsimba. Gusto ko rin pumunta sa events pero ayokong makita parents ko. Pinakasure lang ako ngayon kapag wala ako sa araw na yun gagawa ulit sila ng kwento tungkol sakin na hindi maganda pero di nila sasabihin yung totoong dahilan. Lagi naman silang ganun kaya ako yung bad image sa lahat ng kamag anak ko kahit saang side at sa lahat ng taong nakapaligid samin. Yun yung pinakamasakit sakin ngayon kasi magpapasko. Lagi ako excited magpasko, gustong gusto ko namimigay ng regalo at syempre excited din ako sa mga matatanggap ko pero ngayon kahit isang regalo wala akong binili at wala rin nagtatanong sakin kung anong gusto ko. Expected ko na nakwento na ako sa ibang tao kaya ganun. Sobrang lungkot at hindi ko alam gagawin ko. Ayoko na lang lumabas sa pasko pero iniisip ko baka puntahan ako sa apartment ko tapos gumawa ng eksena. Gusto ko magpakalayo pero may nag aaya naman saking friends to spend the night with them.

* Abilty to pull really strong shots.
* A good manual wand, with the option for auto frothing as well. 
* Relatively low maintenance
* Dont need: Cold brews, non-dairy milk options, super fancy milk drinks.


Been watching several reviews, while there arent as many on the Gaggia, some of the things that caught my attenton on it are:

1. Relatively lower maintenace, esp with the carafe which just flushes through the handle
2. Most customizable settings for coffee strength (e.g. double shot boost, flow restricting)
3. Good manual wand

Was debating between Accademia and Oracle Jet. The gaggia is currently on sale for $1400, which seems like a good deal. Would appreciate any advice.",2,1734202857.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

1he9q9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1he9q9l/chronic_constipation_easing_up_after_years_of/,Chronic constipation easing up after years of turmoil ,"Long story short.. I’ve had chronic constipation for as long as I can remember, it really amped up during college. I was always bloated and pain. Had every test and procedure done.. they diagnosed me w idiopathic constipation and ibs-C. They put me on motegrity at the time and it helped some

After a few years of battling this, this is what works for me. Went from forcing a singular poop to now having a couple of bowel movements a day. 

Supplements 💊:

At night: 
- Motegrity (idk if it makes a difference or is even effective now)
- Fiber ( normal dose of both calcium polycarbophil and psyllium husk) 
- Magnesium oxide (works better for me than magnesium citrate)
- Senna (1-2 tablets depending)

In the morning: 
- Miralax in coffee
- Miralax in water on empty stomach (if starting to get backed up again) 

Exercise: 
Weight lift 30-40 mins 5x a week
Walk / incline on treadmill for 1 hour
Aim for 10k steps a day in total 
Rest when needed 

Sleep: 
Full 7-8 hours nightly 

Diet:
- 97% Whole Foods
- Lots of lettuce/ salad mix.. I’m talking a bag or two a day (honestly this keeps me more regular than the meds)
- cut out things causing gas
- listening to hunger cues 
- chew food better, slowed down 

Last thing… RELAX your Sphincter and LIMIT STRESS (environment, people etc) it really does help A T O N. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share that. I’ve had a lot of relief that I thought I never would experience from this regime… I have a lot less bloating and use the bathroom through out the day. Sometimes 2-3 times a day now.. It’s been years of absolute hell trying to find relief for myself.. I was suffering and wanted to decease bc my colon wouldn’t work properly.. I know the pain. hopes this helps someone out there. Keep working and tweeting things till you find something that works for you! ",2,1734202738.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

My nails are at that ugly, in between phase of regrowth after being chewed down to nothing. It's true that sometimes it can be easier to focus on yourself when you're alone. It feels only logical to conclude that there's some metric of put-togetherness that qualifies us for love; we want to show up securely and with value in our relationships. Love is not a reward for success though, you can love and be loved in imperfection. Personal growth doesn't stop when we're in a relationship, arguably the most profound examples of it will occur when we are. We don't need to wait until all the pieces fit together to deserve the care of others, there is beauty in growing together.

My life is simple, many would say boring; I like it that way, but it does get lonely. I work full time, spending whatever cognition is left over in low key activities - watching tv, reading, playing a video game - things like that. If the mood strikes I might work on a little project here and there, those are usually technology related in some fashion, occasionally crafty. My adventures are mild - going to that one coffee place or restaurant, a relaxing walk, or perusing a thrift or a book store. Larger adventures aren't off the table, but I don't typically pine for them.

I want to say that my wants and needs in a relationship are also simple, but I know that's not the case. I suspect everyone must feel that way about themselves. Down to brass tacks, I'm looking for mutual attraction. To both desire and be desired. I want to hear the latest work and family gossip and about that thing you're strangely interested in or that unpopular opinion you have. What's the inner narrative that runs throughout your day? I want to know about your successes, failures, and struggles no matter the magnitude. I want to support and be supported and be nudged in the right direction when I'm wrong. I want to spend time together, even if we're focused on our own interests, but have common goals that we work towards.

That’s all to say, I’m looking for someone who I think is like me and in a similar place as me. Someone who might routinely feel on the outside looking in, who's content with a simple and largely domestic lifestyle. Someone who considers themselves more on the introverted side, and is kind, honest, curious, quiet, modest, humble, observant, reserved, and stable. You tend to avoid busy and loud spaces and unknown situations probably give you a bit of anxiety so you strategize as much as possible before making your move. You tend to overthink and overanalyze by nature. When you like someone you want to know precisely how their mind works and with every probing question, observation, and discussion, you add a component to your schematic. Eventually, words aren't necessary but, for now, words are all that's available here. You’re not perfect, but you want to do better.

I'm not particularly interested in more pen pals, so if you respond then there should be an intent at pursuing something real, eventually, in whatever form that may take. I have a fair degree of flexibility in my ability to relocate. A more conventional, monogamous relationship is ideal for me but I realize these things can be complicated so I'm potentially open to different forms of romantic expression. I don't care what we talk about, everything we say will be novel and therefore interesting. I want to know everything anyways, from the most mundane choice to the deepest thought. Ideally, we will both be open to discussing anything.

My preference would be to exchange pictures early to establish mutual attraction as, unfortunately, this is important to me and I find that I'm painfully selective - Sorry, I don’t make the rules. That's always awkward, but let's both agree up front that's it's nothing personal. [Here's one of me](https://imgur.com/pfWR9nJ) so that you can decide beforehand. Additionally, in the vein of dealbreakers:

* If you're not in a place where you can make an honest attempt at engaging in conversation, maybe reconsider reaching out. This is a waste of time for both of us.
* I'm 5'9"", ISFJ personality type, physically average/lean.
* I have a bad habit of forming anxious attachments. I'm working on it and making progress. In the meantime, if you know that you have avoidant tendencies then you should know it's going to be a rough go between us.
* Not really interested in politics.
* I’m not religious, but enjoy it as a subject.
* I’m not opposed to pets, but pet ownership feels strange to me.
* I’ve transitioned from smoking cigarettes to vaping incessantly. I don't love that, but that's where I'm at presently, so maybe don't respond if you find that distasteful.
* Don't enjoy 420 or other drugs really, but appreciate the occasional drink.",1,1734202641.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

England ,"Today (Saturday 14/12/2024) I received 2 letters from Basildon council, 1 dated 14/11/2024 and the other dated 08/12/2024 refering to a fine issued by a waste enforcement officer.

I remember the encounter, he approached me in my truck, parked it a layby, as I prepared for my day. He didn't identify himself, or the fact that he had a body cam (although I already knew) he proceeded to ask me to identify a patch of liquid on the ground. I said ""coffee?"" At which point he attempted to issue a ticket. I refused to engage with him and drove away. (I made a separate post about the incident that day, asking for advice)

The first letter describes the fine, £150 reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days of the date on the letter.

 The second is a reminder to pay the £150 within 7 days of the date (08/12/2024) on the letter which means I have to pay it by tomorrow (Sunday)

Please note, these arrived at the same time!

Just as a note, the only thing he could possibly have on camera was me throwing water out after having brushed my teeth.

>I'm looking for gift ideas for my single 27 year old brother. He's getting a surgery done right after Christmas that is supposed to help him smell again (he hasn't been able to smell anything since Middle School). I'm putting a care package together full of items for surgery recovery and cool things for him to smell. As the older sibling, I'm hoping to also put together some funny things to open in front of the family that is hopefully related to smell. As a starting point, if this was 2020, I would have gotten him the Gwyneth Paltrow candle. I am open to any and all suggestions could be stinky stuff, but I'm aiming more for just something outlandish and fun. Also open to just any great smells you have suggestions for! My current idea list for good smells and items for recovery is below if that interests anyone looking for more serious ideas! Thanks in advance!

Don’t get me wrong—there are good things here (beer, trains that mostly show up, and people who somehow know 37 ways to cook potatoes). But holy hell, some things are driving me absolutely insane. Here’s my list of complaints, or as I like to call it, “What the F*, Germany?”**

The bureaucracy is a paper-pushing nightmare from hell.
I swear to God, every time I have to deal with German bureaucracy, I feel like I’m starring in a Kafka novel. Want to register your address? Hope you enjoy filling out 15 forms, all in German legalese, and waiting in line at the Bürgeramt for three hours only to find out you forgot some random document no one told you about. I’m surprised they don’t ask for a blood sample and your great-grandmother’s birth certificate while they’re at it.

Socializing here is about as fun as watching paint dry.
Making friends in Germany is like trying to get into a nightclub with no guest list—you’re just not getting in. People are polite but distant, like you’re a random coworker they have to tolerate. And don’t even think about starting a spontaneous conversation with a stranger. They’ll look at you like you just farted in their general direction.

Everything is closed, always.
Need groceries on a Sunday? Tough s***. Forgot something at 7:01 PM? Too bad, everything’s already locked up tighter than Fort Knox. I get that people here like their “work-life balance,” but what about my need for emergency snacks? Is it too much to ask for one goddamn store to be open after dark?

The obsession with rules is driving me nuts.
Listen, I respect rules…to a point. But here? It’s a whole other level. Want to cross the street when it’s empty? Nope, the old lady across the road will glare at you like you just murdered her cat. Put your recycling in the wrong bin? Congratulations, you’ve just committed a social war crime. Make noise on a Sunday? Expect a passive-aggressive note or a visit from your pissed-off neighbor.

It’s all just so… beige.
Outside of the big cities, everything here feels the same. The people dress the same, eat the same food, and talk about the same boring s*** like rent prices and pension plans. I miss a bit of chaos, a splash of color—hell, even someone arguing loudly in public would be exciting at this point.

The constant complaining.
Oh my God, the complaining. Germans will have a fully functional society, great public services, and an economy that mostly works, but they’ll still find something to b**** about. Too much sun? Too little sun? Rent’s too high? Coffee’s too cold? Jesus, do you people ever stop moaning?

Look, I don’t hate Germany. It’s just that living here feels like trying to date someone who’s really stable but has the personality of stale bread. I’m not sure I can keep doing this without losing my mind.

Anyone else feel like this? Or am I just an a****** who needs to shut up and eat more Brötchen?",119,1734202256.0,expats,66,0.93,False
1he9jjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/poledancing/comments/1he9jjr/how_to_make_pole_friends/,How to make pole friends ,"Hey everyone! I (25M) have recently started going to pole dancing classes and it’s my new hyper fixation that I’m falling in love with. I’m now starting to see first hand stigmas surrounding pole, as one of my female friends I’ve wanted to show my SFW technical skill progress photos to have not only told me she was uncomfortable, but also blocked me immediately. For context, I’m a trans man with AuDHD and truly thought this would be the same as any other sport (like sending them a picture of me kicking a football, except there’s no football and I’m just doing silly lil spins on a chrome bar.) I think I may have misread the situation and just feel horrible I made someone uncomfortable. 

That being said, I really want and need good friends in my life. I’ve had a lot of friend loss this year similar and unrelated to mentioning pole, so I suppose my Saturn return is starting and really kicking me in the ass 😅. So, the instructors and students at my studio are all so nice and supportive and I would love to get to know them better. The issue is they are almost exclusively femme identified people and I’m very afraid of also making them uncomfortable if I try to form bonds with them outside of class. 

During class, I ask if everyone is comfortable for me to take my shirt off occasionally, have mentioned I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable being a masc person in a femme centered space, and try to not make anyone feel like I’m objectifying them by keeping my eyes down or on myself in the mirror unless I’m paying attention to someone for technique. I just try my best to thank the instructors and leave immediately after unless someone wants to make small talk with me. 

Everyone has been so nice and supportive. I think they’re wonderful people I’d love to get coffee with and maybe do other hobbies with outside of class with time. I’m just not sure how to make that jump eventually without being weird or creepy. I’m also very in my head about the possibility where friendship does happen only for me to have to eventually explain how these aforementioned friendships have ended and them no longer feeling safe with me. Maybe the people in my life that have left abruptly this year just aren’t for me and aren’t representative of my souls intention to connect with others, but, going forward, I just want anyone I bring into my life to feel nothing but comfortable and safe with the most authentic version of me I am creating in life and pole. 

Does anyone have any advice on any additional things I can do to continue cultivating a safe space with my presence in a femme space and/or tips on how to slowly get to know people better without my intentions being misunderstood and putting someone in an uncomfortable position?  Thank you all in advance for any advice or support 🫶",2,1734202210.0,poledancing,2,1.0,False

1he96ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1he96ex/zero_symptoms_until/,Zero symptoms until….. ,"I think my long covid is food related. I thought I was recovered and I felt zero symptoms days in a row, even months at one point until I go off my strict low histamine diet. I had even written a recovery post and once deleted my page. I’m Sad to say I’m back here because relating to other gives me hope. 

I think LC gave me allergies to foods I never had before or this is the state I am in now. I had all of the symptoms many have said in these posts. I was “recovered” about a year and some months later with days to months of no symptoms. At that point I was also still on my low histamine diet pretty strict as I had gotten used to eating clean, cooking for myself. No fast food except chicken meals at a few places like chipotle and el pollo where ok. In and out was ok but like once a month. I had been a health person before covid so I was ok with cooking all meals and eating low histamine/clean. I still don’t drink coffee as I feel something after. I also don’t drink unless I’ve been doing great on my diet then I will have one drink like vodka but I’m still pretty scared. I don’t drink soda at all. I only have water, coconut water and apple juice. 

Recently I’ve noticed I’m having not just flare ups but full on relapses it seems for days to weeks. Before it would be like one day or just rashes. Now it’s days in a row of low aniexty feeling, worry, headaches, dizziness, light headed, gut issues, breathing fast not as bad but noticing it,  going #2 often, muscles aches, twitching. Lastnight adrenaline or histamine dumps, heart racing all of this at a low amount then when I first had long covid but I also have not had this in months. I’m now back in bed and back to my strict low histamine diet and bubble baths. I’ll let u know more about what works later. This is long but it’s been a lot. 

What I think happened… first off no supplements worked for me. Just Motrin when I have a headache but I don’t wanna take it daily so I just go strict on my diet again. I think I was thinking I’m normal again and I was going back to too many foods. My husband was on the low histamine diet with me for many months but as we all know it’s very hard and restricting. We didn’t eat at restaurants for a year. Slowly we started going back to restaurants. I still stuck to chicken and fish mostly noticing a reaction with pork. Again I had NO allergies before covid. My husband also started getting bored with the low histamine foods and started buying sweets again and histamine foods like boxed items just not clean. Naturally I couldn’t help myself and tasted some recently. It’s sooo hard when they are in the house. Even things like chilli in a can or peanuts that are good for you can trigger histamine. I was eating peanuts from a tub I bought days in a row and I think this is what set me into a bad flare for weeks. I didn’t know what it was until I stopped the peanuts. I forgot because I was never allergic to them before. I also had a lot of stress recently like moving, car accident and breast cycts all in a month. Even during the move I felt 100% so I didn’t realize it was stress. I think this triggered me into weeks of flare ups daily as well though because I did have worry with the other health issues. I usually don’t stress at all. I work from home, no kids and have a zen life usually. I think the peanuts really did something too me, it’s like some foods trigger worst then others. I had felt back symptoms I hadn’t Felt in months. I was really scared and depressed. When it dawned on me I was like “wait! I’ve been eating peanuts in handfuls every day” could it be as simple as peanuts. Well days later I started feeling better after stopping but it takes days to weeks to flush them out I guess. The problem is also that the reaction dosen’t hit me right away. No more red flushing so I’ll eat them daily feeling a small off feeling then it gets worse and worse. 

What I did that brought me back to zero symptoms. Then what I did just days ago that’s triggered again. This is why I think it’s food:
I went back totally clean low histamine meal prepping after stopping the peanuts. My majic meal is days of anti histamine salmon, broccoli and sweet potatoes. My husband is bored with this meal but I need it so we eat separate now. I snack on apples, blueberries and grapes. After this meal I always start feeling better. I also take bubble baths to stop the aniexty, muscle twitches and aches. Usually right after my meal at night. Dr teals stress relief is the best. I went from crying the night before when the flares started for so long and got worst to zero symptoms the next day. This lasted a week. Of course I get confident thinking oh it was just the peanuts. My husband comes home with ice cream so I eat the bars two nights in a row. I also got cookies because it’s that time of the month. I had some meat he got in a package from the store and also store bought soup with crackers. I don’t eat gluten anymore either so I know this was bad. All with a bunch of ingredients. At this point tho I feel zero symptoms. Then the night after the packaged meat I feel low anxiety. Then lastnight histamine dumps at night and anxiety, muscle twitches, worry. This morning I’m better but today I’m going back on my low histamine diet. I ordered food from the grocery store and have them bring me all the same low histamine cart from before. 

I know this is long but I wanted to write this for anyone that hasent tried low histamine diet strict. I wrote about this when I thought I recovered. It’s the only things that helped me from the beginning of long Covid. Now for me it seems to be trial and error histamine/sugar/not clean foods that I was never allergic to before. If I want to travel or do an event I must go strict low histamine diet a week before. I was forgetting what made me well and starting to major relapse. Almost like I was having LC all over again. It’s hard to stay on the diet but worth it. I also look better physically and the foods are good I just miss some bad items. I think not over doing it also is key and I always seem to over do it. I binge. Hope this helps anyone, atleast I think I know what gives me relief. ",4,1734201201.0,LongCovid,5,0.84,False

1he965z,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1he965z/the_stranger/,The Stranger,"  My wife and I recently moved to her hometown into her childhood home. It was bigger than our old house with plenty of room for not just our two cats, but a new kitten. He was a feisty little guy, easily the most courageous of his siblings. When we brought him home, it wasn’t long before he wanted to explore every nook and cranny of the place. If there was any space we thought it was too dangerous to let him into, he would throw a hissy fit at us, annoyed that there was an untouched area that he wasn’t allowed into. All this is to say, our little guy, Rorschach, was not easily cowed. It was a little surprising to us then, when he was staring, hair up and back arched, into what was to be my wife’s office one evening. The light was on, so I don’t think there was any way he could’ve mistaken anything in there for a threat. Our other cat, Tarrare, was also in the office, so we thought maybe he got spooked by her, seeing as how the little guy still hadn’t gotten completely used to the other cats. I checked the office anyway, for pests or the like, then to be thorough, I looked along the wall outside. Nothing amiss. We didn’t think anything of it at the time. After all, Tarrare was completely at ease in the office.

  A few days later, we put our other cat, Häagen-Dazs, alone in the bathroom with the hot water running. She had allergies and the steam from the shower seemed to ease her sinuses. After a short while, my wife, we’ll call her RocksAnn, went to the bathroom to check on her. When she went in, she saw Häagen-Dazs staring intently at the running water. She called her name, but she didn’t respond. Maybe the running water was too loud. She reached down to pet her, but when she did, Häagen-Dazs flipped out, literally. She sprung up and flipped against the wall like a jack in the box popping out. I don’t know what made the poor girl so spooked. We’d done this shower treatment for her at least a dozen times before, but I guess it was the first time in the new house. Again we didn’t think much of this as all that really happened was our cat got spooked by a room she wasn’t really used to. Cats are finicky like that. Häagen-Dazs was no different and unlike Rorschach was fairly timid and skittish. In fact I wouldn’t have bothered writing and posting anything about these two pretty mundane experiences had it not been for the next few weeks, and now I can’t help but feel there could be more to them.

  I should note how our house is situated. For the most part, it’s the usual setup of a neighbor’s house on either side and facing the street. The back though, rather than being framed by more neighbors, is lined with the town cemetery. It’s actually nice because most of our neighbors play loud obnoxious music. Not a peep from the cemetery though. Anyways, the first few weeks at the house went without incident besides those with the cats. Around the fourth week though, a few things seemed to be amiss. Little things mostly. Lights would flicker off, just for a moment, then something would be in a spot where I swear I didn’t leave it. One time I heard my wife call my name from another room, so I went to check on her.

  “What?”, she asked.

  “You called me.” I told her.

  “Nah, your headphones must be blurring other noises.”

  Maybe. I did always wear headphones while doing most household tasks. Still, I heard her call my name clear as crystal. Could’ve been she was messing with me. We did often scare each other. But that was always by cheap jump scares. Maybe she was making her scare game more convoluted but I didn’t think so. This was a woman whose humor was people falling over. She wasn’t exactly all about subtlety. Besides if she was messing with me, she would’ve made sure to laugh at me about it later, but she never did. That was one of the weirder happenings. Another thing was my figurines. I collect a lot of action figure type stuff, bionicles mostly. Yes I’m twenty six years old. Most of them are pretty poseable figures and can have their limbs and heads moved every which way. Well I had a few on the kitchen table that I hadn’t put on a shelf yet. When I woke up one morning and went into the kitchen to make coffee, I barely noticed that all their heads were looking at the window that faced the cemetery. I know none of them were posed like that the day before. I don’t think my wife did that to mess with me either. It’s such a small thing that I could’ve easily missed. I kinda wish we had some curtains for that window now. 

  Writing this now I also just realized when the weird goings on stopped, at least for a little while. Our house used to have central heating and a/c, but the system hasn’t been used for years, and we had no plans to start it back up again any time soon. So all the ceiling vents that had been open, we closed. It was such a small thing that I didn’t think about at the time. But that’s when all the weird happenings stopped for about a week. I pushed the past events to the back of my mind and assumed it was over. We’d more or less settled in and everything was finally smoothing out. I was content to jot the odd stuff up to the expected stress of moving into a new home. 

  My convenient illusion came to an inconvenient conclusion though, when my wife and I were woken up in the middle of the night by a terrified yelping. I got up and went to the kitchen where it was coming from. When I turned the light on I saw Häagen-Dazs screaming and yelping and pawing at the kitchen window. I put on my shoes and went outside and looked around with my phone light. I probably should’ve also carried a blunt object like a bat or something, but I never claimed to be smart now did I? Besides I assumed it would be something like another cat that set Häagen-Dazs off. Our neighborhood had plenty of outdoor cats after all, and a similar thing happened at our old house with Tarrare. Her and a stray cat had gotten into a tiff with the window keeping them from getting at each other. Anyway I couldn’t find anything outside to warrant concern. That is until I shined the light on the window. That’s when my blood froze. On either edge of the window was a dirty handprint, and in the middle was a badly drawn happy face, also from dirt. Two dots and a semi circle. The dirt had dripped down in spots. From the left eye it looked like a tear. I did not want to be outside a second longer. I went in and made sure all the doors were locked. When I told RocksAnn what happened we decided to call the police. We told them what happened and showed them the handprints. Unfortunately for whatever reason, there were no fingerprints to examine. Whoever it was must’ve been wearing gloves they said. They told us that since we weren’t in the best neighborhood, it’s possible that some kid was in our yard and trying to mess with us. There wasn’t much else they could do, so we were told to keep an eye open and call if anything else happened. We didn’t really sleep that night.

  The next couple of weeks were rough to say the least. I started finding those same dirty handprints on both of our vehicles. A couple times there was one on the living room window. We called the cops again twice, but there was still no way to trace the prints. I wanted to set up cameras but we couldn’t afford much in that department. One night I did tape my phone high on the wall facing the cemetery to record all night. Nothing. Things came to a head on a Saturday night. We were just about to fall asleep, when I heard something that froze my blood. A knock. At the back door. Well not quite a knock. More like a slap. I got up and put on my robe. Quietly as I could, I inched to the front door. RocksAnn waited for me in the living room. I put my ear close to the back door, waiting. In spite of me wearing a fairly thick robe, it felt so cold. I know we hadn’t insulated the back door but still, the cold air was thick and almost made it hard to breathe. Even though I was expecting it, I still almost jumped out of my skin when I heard the slap again. The hand, or what I assumed was the hand, slid against the door. Almost like a cat pawing, but slower and more rough. And also more…deliberate. The doorknob remained undisturbed. I motioned away from the door as silently as I could. My hand found a hammer that I still hadn’t found a place in the house for. The stranger pawed at the door once more. That’s about when I heard the stranger’s voice, only it wasn’t a stranger’s voice. It was my wife’s voice on the other side of the door.

  “H-Hel-lo?”, said the stranger. I was not about to answer back. The way their greeting was spoken sounded breathy. Almost like a whispered hiss. I could see RocksAnn from where I stood at the kitchen/back door. Through the darkness, I could see her face had gone ashen. I can’t imagine I looked any different. The stranger’s one word had shifted our perspective on the past few weeks. Whatever was on the other side of that door was no punk kid or vagrant. No telling if it was really a person at all. And while my wife and I said nothing to each other, the looks we exchanged affirmed that neither of us wanted to find out. After waiting for a few painfully long minutes, the stranger made a new noise. Not a slap on the door, but a knock. And then they spoke once more, now more clearly and fluently. “Hello?” It was my own voice this time. I had to cover my mouth to keep from gasping. It knocked one more time, in this case with a rhythm I used all the time: shave and a haircut. 

  Knock-knockknockknockknock. 

  Now I was starting to get pissed. It’s like it was mocking us, and not just because it was using our voices. Still, I was not about to open the door. Nor were either of us going to say a word to our would be intruder. All we could do was wait. It didn’t knock again. It didn’t repeat its greetings. All it did was breathe, loud enough to be heard by me anyway. It sounded tired. Almost like an old man whose lungs weren’t what they used to be. I hoped it couldn’t hear us breathe. For the better part of an hour I stood by the door shivering. I should’ve been sweating in my thick robe. Eventually the breathing faded, and the deep chill subsided. And the room felt normal again. For a minute I thought it was over, and maybe it was. But I never claimed to be smart now did I? 

  For whatever reason, curiosity, stupidity, whatever you like, I moved my hand to the doorknob. I saw my wife shake her head at me emphatically. I mouthed a probably unconvincing “It’ll be fine” at her, and I opened the door and went outside. I shined my phone light through the night and saw no sign of anything. It was a quiet, still night. Peaceful even. Or at least it would be if it weren’t for the past hour. I shined my light at the still open door. On the outside was the familiar dusty handprint, slid down the door. I put my hand next to it. It was a little smaller than mine. I decided it was probably time to get back inside and lock the door. That was about when I heard a gust of wind getting louder by the second. I swore under my breath and scrambled inside and just as I was slamming the door, I felt a burst of blistering cold, dusty wind. I looked at RocksAnn. She had both hands in her hair and the most horrified look I had ever seen on her face. I tried to think, to delude myself, that maybe it was just ordinary wind, or that I’d closed the door in time. But I knew better. I’d let my curiosity get the best of me. And I’d foolishly let a stranger into our house.",8,1734201181.0,creepcast,0,0.91,False

Get these numbers consistently, sometimes often shortness of breath. Cardiologist & PCP say normal but symptoms interrupt my ability to work","Hi guys.

I'm 22 AFAB, 120lbs, mixed white/asian, alcohol frequency \~1 drink every few weeks, no smoking or drugs, some caffeine (black tea 3-4 times a week, coffee every couple of weeks). Vaccinated for covid-19 in 2021, no booster, and never got sick with it despite multiple exposures. Excercise is primarily a brisk 1-2 mile walk at the park \~once a week before symptoms began, plus yoga (now discontinued) and twice-weekly wing chun classes (took a break over the summer, starting again tomorrow, with accommodation for symptoms)

Family history of heart problems (bypass in grandfather at 50-ish, ICD for dad at 45 who contracted SVT after covid infection last year), mental health issues (autism, ADHD, PPD, depression, anxiety, mood disorders)

Medications/Conditions treated:

Albuterol inhaler for mild-moderate asthma (symptoms typically triggered by secondhand smoke or allergies)

montelukast (used seasonally, not taking it right now) for asthma

hydroxyzine hcl 10mg as-needed for anxiety

dicyclomine as-needed for anxiety-induced IBS (since starting hydroxyzine, I haven't had this issue)

Anything I ever take OTC: Acetominophen/caffeine for period cramps \~once a month, Vitamin D3 5000 IU daily for deficiency, Dessicated adrenal supplement daily just started (naturopath says my adrenal glands ""need support"", based on blood seen under a microscope.

Problem:

My resting heart rate is normally around 80-90 when healthy. Since viral infection in August I can't stand for long periods of time without feeling faint and having heart rate jump to 150-170 (the longer the higher). I also have episodes when my sitting/lying down resting heart rate will be at 130-160 with shortness of breath. Considered calling ambulance but 1) i can't afford it 2) doctors have so far been unhelpful (see below) so I decided not to unless I start feeling like I'm going to pass out imminently. Sitting down for 5-10 minutes USUALLY relieves symptoms, as does eating (even if I'm not hungry).

Timeline of symptoms/diagnostic process:

2021-2023: infrequent tachycardia/palpitations at night, didn't think much of it

late 2023-2024: notice palpitations happening more frequently (every 1-2 weeks instead of 1-2 months)

July 16: mention at physical, schedule EKG

August 7th: Come down with viral infection (possibly covid) Main symptoms are fatigue, muscle weakness, shortness of breath. Symptoms improve after illness passes but don't go away. Roommate suggests POTS but I don't really take her seriously until I learn that POTS can sometimes onset after covid infection.

August 20: EKG with PCP shows premature beats (SVT). Receive ZIO heart monitor and schedule echocardiogram & cardiology specialist for October 30. Mention POTS to PCP and they measure my orthostatic blood pressure. They do it similar to [this CDC guide](https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/STEADI-Assessment-MeasuringBP-508.pdf), but stop after 1 minute of standing. They say no possibility of POTS, I go home feeling unconfident about that verdict.

September 2: Remove ZIO

October 30: See cardio. Echo is postponed to November 18th because of insurance denial. Cardiologist says everything looks and sounds normal. I note that my viral infection symptoms have marginally improved, cardio says that's great and premature beats/ occasional SVT are normal at my age. 

November 18: echocardiogram

\~1 week later: get a call from the office saying that cardiologist said my heart looks healthy and I'll be fine.

Since oct 30 when I had noted improvement, symptoms have not improved further.

I have no more appointments with cardio or my PCP, meaning they've stopped trying to figure this out. But I still have symptoms and they make it hard for me to do work at my job, because I can't stay standing for very long (10-20 minutes) without needing to sit down for a few minutes at least. I attended a standing room only concert on Sunday and my heart rate would continually rise while standing, from about 110 sitting to 130, 150, then 170 standing. At one point after sitting on the floor for about 5 minutes, I took heart rate before/after standing and it went from 98 to 130 just from standing up. I deal with symptoms like this almost daily. Today I woke up with 130bpm heart rate and shortness of breath so bad I almost called the hospital except I can't afford the $1300 ER bill. Thankfully I started to feel better after sitting up.

My job is delivery driving but I also have inside responsibilities like sweeping and dishes. I'm lucky that I can sit down when I take a delivery. With these symptoms I would have lost my old job as a barista because of how much standing it involved-- I can't do that now, when it was part of my day-to-day life for over a year not that long ago. 

I'm incredibly frustrated because I'm already super low-income and have trouble working more than 20hr/week *without* additional issues. (I'm like 99% sure I'm autistic but can't afford an $1100 assessment. Compensating for that at work is what makes me exhausted normally.) I make about 1/4 of the median income in my city and survive by having roommates and minimal expenses, but housing costs are rising in my area and I can't keep up. I might also have to support my sister/fiance soon. Without my health problems *identified* at the very least, I don't even qualify for any kind of assistance. Even SNAP benefits in my state require you to maintain a 20+ hour work week to stay eligible. 

**So I guess my question is what do you think is going on???** It can't be normal or nothing, because it's severely impacting my life. POTS is my primary suspect right now since AFAIK symptoms line up, but I know better than to get stuck on that since I'm not a doctor. I haven't passed out or fainted from my symptoms yet, but that might be because in every situation so far when I might've, I've been able to sit down.

I.B.M. stands for International Business Machines, my Father worked in ‘Field Engineering’ meaning anywhere an IBM ‘Plant’ (The companies business building park)  was he could work there and we could be moved there ( when IBM moved you it was called ‘transferred’- we were transferred 5 times as a family and my Dad was ‘transferred’ about 8 times in his career) IBM had slogans - the single word ‘THINK’ was printed on ashtrays and coffee mugs pens and most of the people who lived or went to school with me families also worked for IBM too (as obnoxious  teenagers we said I.B.M. stood for ‘Itty Bitty Minds’ or ‘ I’ve Been Moved ‘ as a lot of the IBM families I knew were in that same situation as us and lived by us too and were my friends growing up.) People would say wow you moved a lot was your Father in the military? and I said no IBM (a corporate army unto itself, ‘ transferring ‘ its employees all over the ‘ Field ‘….)
So that being said and how I grew up- Severance’s love of acronyms, abbreviations, slogans, corporate terminology is familiar and much used all over the show. Here is a list of ideas of what they stand for broken down by category (sort of like sorting into Bins! also some have links to posts because there are far too many and reddit app doesn't let you copy/paste and i sux at typing) So here is what I have read/or ideas shared for what the acronyms stand for please add any I missed or add your own ideas or links to previous posts and I will add them to an  updated the list and thank you in advance:

# [Patience, Parenting, and Permits: Lessons From Building a Farm](https://taedafarms.com/blogs/news/patience-parenting-and-permits-lessons-from-building-a-farm)

***December 5, 2024***

I’ve always considered myself a patient person. I mean, I’ve got three (soon-to-be-four) kids, and patience is basically the currency of motherhood. Whether it’s answering the same question 47 times in a row or waiting for a toddler to pick their favorite crayon (spoiler: it’s always purple in our house), I thought I had patience down. But let me tell you—nothing, not even the drama of bedtime or the chaos of snack time, prepared me for the patience required to build Taeda Farms.

**Parenting Prepared Me ... Sort Of**

Patience in parenting is like a messy, loud endurance sport that runs on snacks and coffee. Farm patience, though? It’s a quiet grind—grueling in its own right, but without the chocolate bribery. Instead of convincing a small human to just eat the broccoli, I’m learning to wait on permits, surveys, and environmental impact reports. Turns out, bureaucracy doesn’t care about my timeline, and it doesn’t move at the speed of, ""Let’s wrap this up before nap time.” It moves at the speed of, “Let’s schedule another meeting in three weeks.”

And here’s the kicker: I’m a doer. I like to make decisions, take action, and get things done. But this farm? It’s not running on my impulses. It’s running on the pace of nature and government checks and balances—two things that are very thorough and very, very slow.

**Learning to Wait on Wetlands**

Did you know the Army Corps of Engineers checks for wetlands and habitats before you can build? Because I didn’t. When we first heard that, I half-expected someone to show up in camouflage and binoculars to survey the land for rare frogs or nesting salamanders. (Let’s be real, I’d probably offer them caffeine, too, at this point.)

Turns out, their process is less dramatic but just as thorough. They want to ensure we’re not disturbing ecosystems or wetlands, which is actually pretty incredible when you think about it. It’s humbling to realize how interconnected it all is even if my inner toddler sometimes just wants to yell, “Can we plant the flowers already?!”

**The Double-Check Dance**

This whole process has been one giant game of “check it again.” Permitting, zoning, surveying—it all gets reviewed, revised, and re-checked. And just when you think you’re done, someone says, “Actually, one more thing ...” As someone who thrives on momentum (thanks to raising three small humans), adjusting to this snail’s pace has been an experience. (Think the sloths in Zootopia and I am Officer Judy Hopps.) 

There’s no winging it when it comes to land development, which I appreciate ... mostly. (But seriously, when can we plant?!) This kind of patience requires spreadsheets, more meetings than I care to count, and occasionally swallowing my frustration when yet another delay pops up.

**Impatience Meets Growth**

I won’t lie—there have been moments when I’ve wanted to stomp my feet and shout, “Why can’t we just start?!” But this farm isn’t just about me. It’s about creating something meaningful, sustainable, and lasting for our family, the community, and the land itself. That kind of vision requires us to slow down, do things the right way, and embrace the process ... even if that process feels like molasses on a cold day.

**What This Journey Has Taught Me**

Impulse Isn’t Always the Answer: As much as I’d love to grab a shovel and go, this process reminds me that good things take time—and an unreasonable amount of paperwork.

Patience Is a Muscle: And let’s just say mine’s been getting a workout. Who needs a gym when you’ve got delays to endure?

Trust the Experts: Whether it’s the Army Corps of Engineers or the surveyor who now knows this property better than I do at this point, their work matters—even if their pace makes me itch with impatience. 

There’s Beauty in Doing Things Right: Rushing might get things done faster, but it doesn’t create the kind of farm—or life—I want for our family.

**Finding Joy in the Wait**

Patience is hard. No sugarcoating it. But it’s also teaching me to appreciate the stillness, the details, and the meaning behind the wait. Moving at the pace of wetlands assessments instead of impulses? It’s not my natural speed, but it’s a speed that’s helping me grow in ways I didn’t expect. And for that, I’m grateful ... mostly.

So, if you’re stuck waiting in your own journey—whether it’s raising kids, building a business, or waiting for your dream to take root—just know, you’re not alone. Sometimes, progress looks like sitting still, filing the 97th piece of paperwork, and trusting that today’s effort will pay off tomorrow.

1he8tk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1he8tk5/fresh_of_the_jubilee/,Fresh of the Jubilee!,"Well, after waiting a year (from the time of our booking) we finally got to enjoy the latest that Carnival offers.  I know the Excel class ships seem to be a love it or hate it class and we loved it.  I can see why some might not like it, the tried-and-true layouts that Carnival have been using work, but I don't think they can work for larger class ships.  You have to disperse the crowds, and the Excel class does, IMO, a great job of it.

The variety of shows, food and activities are almost overwhelming.  We ate at the following:  Pacific Main Dining, Chi-bang, Cucina del Capitano, Beach Buns, Coastal Slice, Street Eats, Shaq's, Guys's Burgers, Pig and Anchor, Lido Marketplace and the 555 Steakhouse.  Everything we had was quite good.  Shaq's may be the new go to for first meal over Guy's now, lol.  The crazy variety of food makes me wonder what the folks who complain about not finding anything good to eat are on, lol.   Our only complaint as far as dining was on the second elegant night.  I have no idea what was happening with the reservation system for Your Time Dining, but it was broken that night!  60-70 minute wait times on the app, double booked warnings.  They acted like nothing was wrong, but the number of hangry folks waiting to be seated said there was.  But that was about all we could complain about for food.  We had the Cheers package and there was a ton of variety when it came to places to grab your drinks.  Dr Inks, of course, is the place to go if want some truly unusual and fun drinks for sure.  

As far as activities, we caught comedy shows, stage shows in both theaters (Seaside and the Jubilee Theater), we rode The Bolt (100% worth it) and did the ropes course and we also did the Behind The Fun Tour.  We lounged in several different areas outdoors.  The one thing that really surprised us was that we NEVER saw the seat saving or even overcrowding around the pool areas.  This was first for us. You could find good seating pretty much anywhere at any time.  

Now, the only thing we actually did not like?  Those darn accessibility doors on all public restrooms.  Now, we understand the need, but the implementation is terrible.  Once open, they stay open to allow a wheelchair user to easily gain access.  No problem.  But...there is no way to close the door immediately if you do not need to use the accessible feature.   That means that door is wide open for anyone passing by to get a glimpse of urinal action.  This is not for all of the restroom, but several have this fault in their layouts where you can see the sinks and urinals and anyone who might be using them.

Our only other complaint is more a Carnival complaint as it is not ship specific.  Open times for food.  There seems to always be a dead zone for food.  If you are an early riser, you have the choice of coffee or coffee.  I don't know if it's a new policy or maybe just for the Excel class, but there is no continental breakfast available (previous ships would have a small area open at 6am with some breads, cheeses, meats and fruits.  Nowhere to found here.  The strange timing gaps for lunch and dinner are also odd.  Having done the Behind the Fun Tour, we know that it's now a galley issue as the Excel class ships have several large and small galleys to server each area.  

So, those two issues were really minor in the grand scale of things.  Not saying much about the ports since we have been to all of them (Roatan, Costa Maya and Cozumel) and didn't do any planned activities.  I do feel for those that did schedule excursions as Roatan and Costa Maya were plagued by rain.

So all in all, for us, we loved the Jubilee/Excel class.  We would sail it again without hesitation.

Some thoughts and questions:

1) pretty sure both were basically brand new. I think the Racer was an open box return that they restocked and sold at a discount, but the Roadster has its original tags and smells brand new. I cannot find blemishes or defects on either of them. Very pleased with the quality!   

2) disappointed how small they run. I’m 200lbs, athletic frame, into bodybuilding, 5’10, ~15% body fat and they are too tight. I was planning to drop another 10lbs and get a bit more “shredded” but it’s disappointing that a large *athletic* tailored jacket fits so tight and small. I would size up! And unfortunately I can’t return them for an XL but the website size calculator even indicated I would be a Large and I’m very rarely ever an XL for anything. 90% of my jackets and shirts are Large and in fact my Peacoat is actually a Medium. I also found the sleeves on the Roadster to be a bit long and more like an XL so I would say the cut of the jacket leaves a bit to be desired honestly. But it looks killer besides the size issues!

3) I was wondering if the jackets require any special upkeep or conditioning? Particularly the black coffee roadster? Similar to boots do I need to condition or do anything in particular with them? Hang them a certain way?

What happens if I spill something on them or get caught in the rain with them? Is that a big no-no with leather or are they treated to withstand the elements?

Anything else I should know in general before wearing them?

They are too tight to comfortably fit as of now bit hopefully after the holidays if I lean out a bit more they will. Worst case I guess I can sell them and recover most of my losses. ",1,1734200075.0,ThursdayBoot,0,0.67,False
