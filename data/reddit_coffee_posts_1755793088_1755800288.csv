But basically I found messages dated back to the day before our child's 1st birthday; where my partner of 5yrs is talking to a former temp employee that is 20+yrs younger than him-- its important to know that I worked for him and with her and she spent her 6 months there being petty towards me, messing up my paperwork and parking in my parking spot, laughing about it all to coworkers how she could make me mad. I didn't know I was preggo at the time my emotions were intense when I found out what she really was doing. Everyone told me. I had pictures and screenshot. I told my boss/partner what was going on and he constantly defended her. Said I was ridiculous and I was being petty and I should just get over it and let it go. Then he sent me home unpaid one day after he ""asked me"" if I ""wanted or could"" pick up lunch for everyone.  Mind you I run several departments,  so no I do not want to and am very busy. I noticed the girl was doing nothing AS USUAL (she literally was paid to sit on the comp. Play solitaire and answer the 4 phone calls we got a day.) I said she was free where i was not. Fast forward shes gone from temp and deleted her #.  Hes been messaging her trying to get her to go for coffee or drinks secretly so no one from work sees them because of the ""BS that starts"" he says. Then he brags about giving her a reference. And jokes that he told the guy she quit working for him because her ""onlyfans"" blew up and asked for the handle to pass along. Then proceeds to let her talk about me as an object, and he vents that im bad with money and hes so glad shes not because wise older men love girls like her. 
Its also important to note that after we had an explosion unrelated to these messages, when we were talking through what issues we have i brought her up and we had to agree to disagree because he still believes she was innocent and I over reacted.  And now I find these messages. From June, July and last week. Where shes not falling for his bait but he is laying it on thick with all these perverted comments. And betrayal. And secrecy. 

 This is over isn't it??? I mean. You literally took her side over me time and time again and then start having secrets with her. This is betrayal. And what a sick fuck! 

His ""image is everything"" and hes always said he wouldnt cheat because of his reputation. Im so ready to leak this to his whole family and workers.

1mwiktn,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/1mwiktn/enhancing_thematic_song_recommendation_apps_with/,Enhancing Thematic Song Recommendation Apps with AI (Now Without the Spotify API),"https://preview.redd.it/cd8d1hwlxekf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9eb43c54e69cc5b57c538726b0925ff1466c2d69

The first app I ever developed with the Spotify API was a playlist generator for Khruagbin. It allowed fans to generate a playlist for an upcoming flight and tailored the recommended songs based on how they answered a series of thematic questions. Do you like coffee or tea? If you chose coffee, perhaps we’d deliver tracks with higher energy. Do you like to sit next to the window or on the aisle? If you chose aisle, maybe you are also willing to get up and dance so we’d recommend more danceable songs. We can accomplish these sorts of thematic activations with a bit of smoke and mirrors. In the case of this app, we correlated answers to the air travel questions to audio features readings available for each song on the Spotify platform. 

Last December, I wrote about how Spotify removed audio features and a few other things from their platform. (More on that later.) Since then, not a single client has asked me to build a Spotify application though I don’t think the two are directly related. 

We actually don’t *need* audio features to achieve these sorts of applications. I’ve also done correlation in a more abstract or simple way. On a very recent project for Lil Poppa, we looked at the lyrical content of his new album and hand-matched each song with various standard therapy topics. We then allowed fans to submit a sentence about what they were going through, figured out which therapy topic it pertained to, and then recommended a song off the album as treatment. No audio features needed. The recommendation was accomplished with a bit of natural language processing by looking for keywords related to the therapy topics in the user provided statement. However, this didn’t always do the trick because language is complicated and we used \*gasp\* AI (OpenAI to be exact) to fill in the gaps. 

When I set out to develop the experience, I wasn’t aiming to build an AI powered app, it just felt like a natural solution to this particular problem. However, once I saw our little AI therapist song recommender in action, I couldn’t help but think about more applications. Song recommenders and playlist generators are very interesting activations. They typically require a user to give a bit of themselves by answering a quiz, providing a statement, or sharing their weather, and in turn receive a playlist or are recommended a song. More importantly, they create an additional touchpoint to recommend music and that opportunity could be just as appealing to non-fans also. For example, take the AirKhraung playlist generator. This utility was marketed to anyone taking an upcoming flight, not just Khruangbin fans. Because of this, it appeared on travel publications in addition to music blogs. In short, these types of activations can be perfect little gateways to your music.

Anyway, back to OpenAI and how we achieved this for Lil Poppa. We very simply used the \`/chat/completions\` endpoint of the API and asked it to act like a therapist and return an array of therapy topics (from a strict list we already correlated with song) in response to a user provided statement. This was accomplished with one system role message and another user role message. Here’s the system role message.

    const systemMessage = {
      role: ""system"",
      content: `
        You are a therapy assistant. You will receive a user statement.
        Return a JSON array of therapy topics that apply, selecting ONLY from this fixed list:
    
        anxiety
        depression
        trauma
        selfEsteem
        identity
        …
        
        Only return an array of topic strings from the list. No explanation.
      `
    }

And the user message is predictably simple and contains their issue.

    const userMessage = {
      role: “user”,
      content: “I’ve been overwhelmed by work lately and I can’t sleep.”
    }

We can then send this all through the chat completions API.

    const response = await fetch(""https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"", {
      method: ""POST"",
      headers: {
        ""Authorization"": `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
        ""Content-Type"": ""application/json""
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: ""gpt-4"",
        messages: [systemMessage, userMessage],
      })
    })

And, if OpenAI can figure it out, we’ll receive a list of topics in return. We can then find the associated tracks and recommend them to the user. Pretty simple. Again, we used AI as a backup to natural language processing. I’m not going to require my clients to pay for an additional service unless I think it enhances the experience or helps solve a problem. So, only those user statements which the local app can’t figure out are then processed by AI. 

Regardless, you can imagine how this setup could be customized to fit a bunch of thematic scenarios. How about tarot card readings, pandemic friendly playlisting, or postcard distribution.  I would just focus on keeping the overall request snappy and functional since OpenAI charges you on the complexity of the prompts. 

On the topic of Spotify audio features, I’m curious where AI providers like Cyanite can fill in the gaps. In general, while I loved the Spotify audio features part of the API (Shout out to my Echonest friends,) it was never really expanded or evolved on and then, it was killed. Cyanite seems to be heavily invested in creating an advanced API for music tagging and what looks like a developer friendly experience. I’m looking forward to finding a place for it in my client and software work.

I’m curious. Do you find music tagging as inspiring as me? Have you started sprinkling AI into your marketing activations? Have you come across any music recommenders or playlist generators that have stood out to you? Thanks for reading.

1mwie07,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1mwie07/reveal_the_best_electric_kettle_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Electric Kettle Experience with DEZIN Review,"The DEZIN 8856 electric kettle quickly became one of my favorite gadgets in the kitchen. The moment I unboxed it, the sleek black design, combined with its stainless steel finish, impressed me. While testing it every morning for my tea rituals and occasional evening coffee sessions, I noticed just how practical and feature-rich it was. That being said, it’s not without its quirks, so let’s dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This electric kettle doesn’t just boil water; it looks good doing it. The smooth painted surface in black pairs beautifully with any modern kitchen décor, and the double-wall design is both functional and safe. I liked that the outer layer stays cool to the touch during operation, saving my clumsy self from accidental burns. It is slightly heavier compared to some plastic electric kettles I’ve used, but that’s the trade-off for a more robust, stainless steel interior. Cleaning it was surprisingly simple, thanks to the large opening on top, which made scrubbing quick and hassle-free. 

**Standout Highlights**  
- The 9 preset variable temperature settings were a game changer. Making green tea? Just set it to the appropriate temperature and let the kettle do the rest.  
- I loved the LED display—it doesn't just look cool but also gives real-time insights into water temperature. Let’s be honest, who doesn’t like precision while brewing their favorite tea?  
- The BPA-free stainless steel interior was a welcomed reassurance when it came to maintaining the taste and quality of the water.  

[Check DEZIN 8856 price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b0d9gdx83l/)

**Performance and Speed**  
An electric kettle’s primary role is speed, and this one didn’t disappoint. Boiling 1.7 liters in about 5-7 minutes felt incredibly efficient during my busy mornings. The 1200W power ensures I wasn’t waiting around for my caffeine fix. One feature I found incredibly handy was the ""BOIL STOP,"" which allows you to heat the water to a specific temperature without boiling it completely. This feature particularly shined when testing it for delicate beverages like white tea or even warming water for my niece's baby formula. 

**Keep Warm Feature**  
The 12-hour keep-warm function was like having a diligent tea butler. My mornings often stretched into brunches, and knowing the water stayed at an ideal temperature saved me the hassle of reheating it. Another smart addition was the memory function. Though I initially brushed it off as just another feature, it quickly became clear how convenient it was when I realized it retained the last set temperature for subsequent uses.

**Safety Features**  
Being someone who frequently forgets appliances running, I appreciated the automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection features. On one occasion, I powered it on while still half-asleep and walked away—moments later, I heard the soft click of it shutting off once the water reached the preset temperature. That level of safety gives me peace of mind, especially in a busy household.

**Good Points**  
- Sleek stainless steel and black exterior matches modern kitchens.  
- Preset temperatures are a dream for tea and coffee enthusiasts.  
- Boil times are impressively fast for 1.7 liters of water.  

**Limitations**  
As much as I found it an upgrade over my previous kettle, there are some areas that could be improved.  

- The initial weight caught me off guard. At 2.88 pounds, it felt slightly bulky compared to lighter models, which might not suit everyone.  
- Although the LED display and features are fantastic, figuring out all the buttons required some patience. A clearer manual could make a noticeable difference.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing the DEZIN 8856 to competitors, two names came to mind: the Hamilton Beach 1.7L Glass Electric Kettle and the Cosori 1.7L Stainless Steel Electric Kettle. The Hamilton Beach model has a glass body, which is undeniably elegant, though it lacks the “keep warm” and “preset temperature” features. The Cosori kettle does offer presets but at a higher price point, and its build is not quite as substantial. What stood out for me was the combination of affordability and versatility in this product—features like the memory function set it apart, making it an appealing pick for tea enthusiasts like myself. 

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Value is always a significant factor when selecting appliances, and I found this kettle hit the sweet spot between affordability and performance. It was clear that it aimed to serve users seeking advanced features in an accessible package. While it may not be ideal for those searching for ultra-lightweight options, it brings worthwhile features such as variable temperature controls and the robust build that justify its price range.

[Our flagship product, the Z1](https://preview.redd.it/9ocegd9kvekf1.jpg?width=5745&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d368a40ed00b9146737f62ecd8fbad61838fb34)

Along with the EAF Discord group (Espresso Aficionados), we took an open-source approach to design and collaboration with the coffee community in real-time. The result: we created an **award-winning 64mm grinder — the Z1,** ***2024 Best New Product*** **by the Specialty Coffee Association — and just-released the 80mm Z2.** In just four years, Zerno has grown from 2 guys with an idea and a prototype shared on Discord to a vertically integrated company and brand with thousands of grinders in kitchens worldwide.

**On August 28th ask us anything about:**

* How we go from back-of-napkin ideas to production-ready products.
* Lessons learned (and mistakes made) during prototyping and café testing.
* How we think about usability, ergonomics, and data in espresso.
* The growth of Zerno — and how your feedback shapes it.
* The challenges of hand assembling products locally in Chicago, and our efforts to reduce lead times without compromising precision.
* The new 80mm Z2.
* What’s next?

We’ll be here answering questions throughout the day. If you want to dive deep into burr design, variable RPM, UI philosophy, or even the “Grand Universal Theory Of Coffee Grinding”, now’s your chance.

1mwic62,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1mwic62/social_media_makes_life_and_the_world_seem_scary/,Social media makes life and the world seem scary.,"A friend of mine showed me am animation about a. man who is obsessed with videos of random people being recorded with funny voice overs from the uploaders. A guy eating a burger at a restaurant becomes a meme without his knowledge, and I wondered how often that really happens. 

She called it a ""surveillance obsessed society"" where people are afraid of being out in large spaces because someone might be recording them without their consent and the internet could turn them into a viral sensation from something as tame as dropping their phone and picking it up. 

I've been to places like Los Angeles in really busy areas and I don't think I've seen people recording stuff, maybe some selfies here and there or people chilling at a park and having a coffee while looking at their phone.

Social media makes it seem like it's an epidemic, but it really isn't. It's almost like spending so much time on the internet, and video platforms in particular, skews our view of reality and we experience a minor culture shock when we step outside of the screen and realize that every day life is more humdrum than anything.

Maybe that's why people are so addicted to scrolling, because life itself is just life, it's not an action movie. But a guy on TikTok could edit a video of him shopping and make it seem like every item in the store requires a blood sample, and a soul contract to buy because 'Big Government doesn't want you to buy underwear' and people watch with bated breath and dread running out of food at home.

1mwi8i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/1mwi8i7/style_references_that_actualy_work_vs_ones_that/,Style references that actualy work vs ones that produce garbage (tested 200+ combinations),"this is going to save you hours of prompt testing because most “cinematic” references are completely useless…



I spent 3 months testing every style reference I could think of. Movie names, director names, camera types, color grades, lighting setups. Most produced inconsistent garbage or looked exactly like every other AI video.



\*\*Here’s what actually works consistently:\*\*



\## Camera references that deliver:



\### \*\*“Shot on Arri Alexa”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~90%

\- Produces: Professional color science, natural skin tones

\- Best for: Portraits, commercial content



\### \*\*“Shot on RED Dragon”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~85%

\- Produces: High contrast, cinematic look

\- Best for: Action, dramatic content



\### \*\*“Shot on iPhone 15 Pro”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~95%

\- Produces: Natural, accessible aesthetic

\- Best for: Casual content, behind-the-scenes feel



\## Director style references that work:



\### \*\*“Wes Anderson style”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~90%

\- Produces: Symmetrical composition, pastel colors, precise framing

\- Extremely consistent results



\### \*\*“David Fincher style”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~85%

\- Produces: Dark, moody, high contrast

\- Great for dramatic content



\### \*\*“Denis Villeneuve style”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~80%

\- Produces: Epic scale, desaturated colors, wide shots



\## Movie cinematography references:



\### \*\*“Blade Runner 2049 cinematography”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~90%

\- Produces: Orange/teal grade, atmospheric lighting

\- Most reliable sci-fi aesthetic



\### \*\*“Her cinematography”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~85%

\- Produces: Warm, intimate, soft lighting

\- Perfect for emotional content



\### \*\*“Mad Max Fury Road cinematography”\*\*



\- Success rate: \~75%

\- Produces: High energy, warm colors, dynamic framing



\## Color grading terms that actually work:



\### \*\*“Teal and orange grade”\*\*



\- Most reliable color reference

\- Works across all content types

\- Instant cinematic feel



\### \*\*“Golden hour grade”\*\*



\- Warm, natural, universally appealing

\- Great for portraits and lifestyle content



\### \*\*“Film noir lighting”\*\*



\- High contrast, dramatic shadows

\- Perfect for moody content



\## Style references that consistently fail:



❌ \*\*“Cinematic”\*\* - too vague, produces nothing distinctive



❌ \*\*“High quality”\*\* - meaningless to AI models



❌ \*\*“Professional”\*\* - doesn’t specify anything useful

❌ \*\*“4K masterpiece”\*\* - pure prompt fluff



❌ \*\*“Epic”\*\* - produces overblown, generic results



\## My testing methodology:



For each style reference, I generated 10 variations with identical prompts except for the style element:



\`\`\`

Medium shot, person drinking coffee, morning light, \[STYLE REFERENCE\], static camera

\`\`\`



Tracked:

\- Consistency across generations

\- Visual distinctiveness



\- Platform performance

\- Overall aesthetic quality



\## Advanced combination strategies:



\### \*\*Layered references that work:\*\*



\`Shot on Arri Alexa, Wes Anderson style, teal and orange grade\`



\### \*\*Specific + general approach:\*\*



\`Blade Runner 2049 cinematography, moody lighting, urban atmosphere\`



\### \*\*Camera + color combination:\*\*



\`Shot on RED Dragon, film noir lighting, high contrast black and white\`



I’ve been systematically testing these through \[these guys\](https://dayyan.xyz/video) at veo3gen.app who offer way cheaper veo3 access than Google directly. Makes comprehensive style testing actually affordable.



\## Platform-specific style performance:



\*\*TikTok preferences:\*\*

\- iPhone style references perform better



\- High energy movie references

\- Bright, saturated color grades



\*\*Instagram preferences:\*\*



\- Wes Anderson style dominates

\- Golden hour grades consistently perform

\- Clean, aesthetic camera references



\*\*YouTube preferences:\*\*

\- Professional camera references



\- Established movie cinematography

\- Consistent visual branding



\## Content type + style matching:



\### \*\*Portrait content:\*\*



\- “Shot on 85mm lens, golden hour backlight”

\- Fincher style for dramatic portraits

\- Soft lighting references



\### \*\*Product content:\*\*



\- “Macro lens, studio lighting setup”

\- Clean, commercial cinematography

\- Neutral color grades



\### \*\*Action content:\*\*



\- “Handheld camera, motion blur, dust particles”

\- Mad Max or action movie references

\- High contrast grades



\## The reference library system:



Keep successful combinations organized by:

\- \*\*Performance data\*\* (engagement, views)

\- \*\*Consistency ratings\*\* (how reliable across generations)



\- \*\*Content type compatibility\*\*

\- \*\*Platform optimization\*\*



\## Common mistakes I see:



1. \*\*Using vague creative terms\*\* instead of specific technical references

2. \*\*Mixing too many style elements\*\* - confuses the AI

3. \*\*Not testing consistency\*\* - assuming one good result means it always works

4. \*\*Ignoring platform preferences\*\* - same style for all platforms



\## Pro tip for building your style:



Find 3-5 style references that work consistently for your content type. Use variations of those instead of constantly experimenting with new ones.



\*\*Consistency > creativity\*\* for building recognizable content.



\## The bigger insight:



\*\*Specific beats creative every time.\*\* “Teal and orange grade” produces better results than “beautiful cinematic colors.”



AI models respond to precise technical terms, not abstract creative concepts.



Started using systematic style testing 4 months ago and content quality became way more predictable. Less random results, more professional feel.

1mwi8d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mwi8d3/friend_moving_away_and_im_taking_it_personally/,Friend moving away and I’m taking it personally,"I have a friend moving across the country this weekend to be in a relationship with a old flame she rekindled with. I am a heterosexual guy early 30s happily Married to a teacher who has lived where I live now my entire life. I’m an outgoing outdoorsy Abercrombie, brewery going standard dude. I have a hard time relating to hipsters and super nerdy people. I’m more like a jock in that I easily connect with people who I consider outgoing I go to the gym I might be a bit of a douche, but I don’t care. You’ll never catch me wearing a hipster hat unless it’s a Halloween costume. 

My issue is that in the past three years I’ve lost 3 of my core friends to them moving away. My best friend who I lived with for seven years in my first place moving out moved a couple of states over with his now fiancé to start a coffee business. It’s actually doing really well and I’m very happy for him and he wasn’t originally from where I was either. He was my best man at my wedding and I consider him a brother for life but now that he’s gone, I feel like I have no one. I relate to I work remote in an entertainment industry filled with quite nerdy introverts. Not the types who would go on a camping trip or have ever gotten their hands dirty for fun. There’s nothing wrong with that it’s just not who I am. My best friend was like that and now he’s gone. I had another friend who’s leaving in a couple of days to be with her boyfriend who lives there. He made her get rid of her cat and she did it because she knew it was a dealbreaker. She peed a lot on his furniture. For context we work in the same industry, and since I work remote, we would meet at cafés to work together. She’s one of the very few people in this industry I can relate to. Also I know it’s weird to be friends with a girl but most guys in my industry are just not confident and or huge nerds so I just can’t connect with them. I have some friends who are guys in my industry but not really super close with them.
I go to church, but I find most couples there are in their 40s and older and their kids are already out of the house.


 To get to the point is I take it personally when my friends leave it bothers me their relationships or business is worth throwing away many friends to start over. Same with my best friend. He could have could have also made a coffee shop in our state just as easily but it had to be where he and his wife wanted it. Now her parents have moved to be closer to them so he has no reason to really come back here unless it’s to see me. (His family lives in a different state) Is it bad that it bothers me? Am I just being selfish? I think ditching your friends to roll the dice on something can also be seen as selfish? Please tell me if I’m just an asshole. I know I can be a bit dumb sometimes. I hope that someone will rip me a new one so I can let this go 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to go to meet ups for making new friends with couples in their 30s because that’s weird in my opinion and I wouldn’t wanna hang out with someone that does that again nothing wrong with that it’s just in my core values that’s not who I am . I’m the jockey guy that makes a friend at a bar in his 20s now I’m in my 30s I don’t do that kind of stuff anymore but my closest friends were those kinds of people. I just feel bad I’m angry. I’m being left by everyone closest to me. My wife is a teacher so I don’t see her unless it’s on weeknights or weekends that leaves me with a lot of time to be in my own head of course I have my job, but I’m at home alone so having other people to relate to as an extrovert is really important to me. Anyways thanks for reading all this. Any tips or advice would be appreciated.  

More context we plan on having a baby in the next year or so. Maybe then I’ll have a chance to make some friends at pregnancy classes or something like that. ",3,1755798991.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1mwi7eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TexasTech/comments/1mwi7eq/neds_declassified_texas_tech_survival_guide_part/,"Ned's Declassified Texas Tech Survival Guide, Part 2: Places to Eat","Good afternoon everyone, it is a great day to be a Red Raider! Seeing that [my last post in this sub got tons of traction](https://www.reddit.com/r/TexasTech/comments/1mup13f/neds_declassified_texas_tech_survival_guide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I figured I would go ahead and add on to the concept and go over the best places to eat near Texas Tech campus and in the greater Lubbock area. These are ranked in *no particular order*, so please don't get mad if I have one spot above another. I will, however, share my own personal anecdotes about each place and try to assign each restaurant a cost ranking, with one dollar sign being low cost (typically under $20 a person) and three dollar signs being a high cost (typically over $30 a person).

**Near Campus Must-Haves**

* Spanky's - $
   * This place has been here since 1982, and it has stayed for a reason: some of the best burgers and appetizers you can get. Their famous fried cheese is an absolute must have. I would consider it a rite of passage for any freshman.
* One Guy from Italy - $
   * Easily the best pizza joint close to campus (but not my favorite overall, which will be included further down in the list). Really solid pizza and massive calzones, this family-run pizza joint is a great spot to grab pizza by the slice or order a whole pie for you and your friends
* Jazz - $$
   * An authentic Louisiana Cajun kitchen, this is an all time favorite near campus. Great spot to watch a game, see live music, and eat the best Cajun food in town. They have a weird tradition of people signing dollar bills and pasting them on the walls, so be sure to add your own piece of history when you go.
* Torchy's - $
   * Some of the most unique taco combinations I have ever seen at a restaurant, and nearly every one of them is delicious. This place is a short throw from the Jones football stadium and gets busy on gameday!
* Fuzzy's -$
   * Solid spot for tacos and drinks. I recommend getting the Queso Blanco here, it is VERY good.
* Chimy's -$
   * If you don't know about this place, you should. This is a storied bar right on broadway. The food here is good, but the drinks are even better. Great outdoor seating too!
* Raider Burrito - $
   * My favorite ""hole in the wall"" Mexican food joint. Best breakfast burritos near campus, in my humble opinion, and their lunch and dinner offerings are great, too.
* Blue Sky - $$
   * Very good burger spot to grab a beer at and watch the game. Unique sides like frito pies, sweet potato fries and fried mushrooms that could almost be their own meal themselves. They also have shakes and floats using Blue Bell ice cream.
* Capital Pizza - $$
   * I promised you I would tell you my favorite pizza spot, and here it is. Situated just south of campus in the beautiful Tech Terrace neighborhood, they have all the classic tasty pizzas you expect and many others you wouldn't even dream of. Great spot to grab a beer with friends, too.
* Lubbock Pancake House -$
   * Looking for a spot to nurse that hangover with delicious pancakes and hot coffee? Lubbock Pancake House has you covered. Classic diner with tons of Lubbock and Texas Tech memorabilia on the walls. I will also add that they have student specials and some of the friendliest wait staff in town.

**Lubbock Local Favorites**

* Lite Bite - $
   * Best Mediterranean restaurant in Lubbock, hands down. This restaurant has been around for decades, run by a wonderful husband and wife duo. The Mezza Sampler here gets you a little taste of all their best stuff. Highly recommend!
* Escondido Grill - $$
   * If you want a restaurant with some scenery, drive out north near the airport and you will find Escondido Grill. The restaurant is situated right along a creek that has hundred year old Elm, Oak, and Cypress trees. The green chile cream corn is very good here, and keep your eye out for the peacocks that roam the property.
* Taqueria Jalisco - $
   * I'd rank this as one of the most authentic Mexican food joints in Lubbock. Not a far drive from campus and the place has some of the best enchiladas I have ever had. Good margs too!
* Orlando's - $$
   * ""Orlando's is a little Italian and a lot of fun!"" Their motto is every bit as true as can be. This place ended up on [Texas Country Reporter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5mKwbrUQ8I) a couple of years ago and it deserves the recognition. Only a few blocks away from campus, this place prides itself on a unique Italian/Tex-Mex style of cuisine like no other. I highly recommend getting some of the Mafia Queso when you go.
* Evie Mae's - $$$
   * I would almost say the legends about this place are bigger than this restaurant can ever fulfill, but if you want fantastic barbecue in Lubbock, look no further. The word of mouth speaks for itself, you can ask any Lubbock local what the best barbecue in town is and, odds are, they'll say Evie Mae's.
* Chuy's - $
   * Looking for cheap TexMex with a fun, college vibe? Chuy's has you covered. Even though it located on the south side of town, every night it is packed with college students. Free chips and salsa (as God himself intended) with your usual TexMex food offerings. Solid selection of drinks here too!
* Seoul Korean Cuisine - $

  Siobhan Ashdown slammed her car door and looked up at the house. The realtor was already ten steps ahead of her and fumbling with the metal key holder than hung from the house’s front door knob. Siobhan stayed where she was, her light brown eyes narrowed on the house’s façade, her auburn hair brushing against her cheeks, neck and bare arms.  
  
  Down the street, a cop car kept a discreet distance, its occupants quietly watching Siobhan, though she could feel their presence as strongly as if they were standing inside of her personal space bubble. She turned and shot them an “I know you’re there and I’m grateful” smile, waved, and acknowledged the return flash of headlights. Then she looked back up at the house.  
  
  It was a Victorian styled manor and, according to its records, it was one hundred and thirteen years old. From what Siobhan could see, it showed. The wrap-around porch hosted broken beams and a sagging roof topped with cracked and splitting tiles. Half of the windows on all three of its above-ground levels were shattered or boarded up. The red brick chimney jutting from the top roof was half as tall as it should have been and quickly crumbling to its foundation.  
  
  The building’s wooden exterior had seen so many layers of paint, it was difficult to tell which was supposed to be the latest, and the house’s grounds were a tangled mass of dead or dying rose bushes, shrubs, and crab grass.

But the close-looking eye could see there was scrollwork in the wood that spoke of a careful, skilled craftsman’s hand. Some of the windows that remained intact sported stained glass figures in beautiful clothing and graceful poses. And the mansion’s foundation gave the artistic impression of Germanic wooden bridges spanning babbling brooks. The wooden shingles might be molded or missing, but once upon a time, a lot of love had gone into the creation of this home.  
  
  As Siobhan stood there and took it all in, the realtor straightened on the front porch and shot a worried look over the padded shoulder of her dark blue blazer. The realtor’s name was Jane, which struck Siobhan as secretly funny. It seemed every realtor she’d ever met had been named Jane.  
  
  No doubt, at that moment, Jane was thinking that Siobhan had changed her mind. In fact, Jane had probably lost hope before she’d even allowed it to take hold; the house had been on the market for two long years since its last owner. No realtor in her right mind would begin to feel hope now.  
  
  But Siobhan hadn’t changed her mind. She wasn’t going to turn tail and run. She wasn’t that kind of girl.  
  
  With a smile meant to reassure, Siobhan left the side of her car and made her way up the walk that led to the front porch. The cement, which obviously wasn’t a part of the original home but had been added years later, was cracked and overgrown with yellow weeds that someone had half-heartedly sprayed with poison. Siobhan counted the cracks; she couldn’t help it. It was something she’d always done. There were thirty-two before she reached the bottom step.  
  
  Countless changing seasons had seen the paint job on the stairs peeled into curly-q ringlets and guitar-pick sized chips of white that looked like a dragon’s lost scales. Warped wood yawned open underneath, charcoal-gray and dry as a bone.  
  
  Five steps to the top.  
  
  The house seemed to lean toward her as she reached the last step and stood before the door. Jane gave her a wan smile and turned to unlock it. Siobhan noticed the key she used: A skeleton key.  
  
  “Now, as I mentioned before, this one has been empty for a while. As you can see, it needs a bit of upkeep,” Jane told her as she fumbled with the lock. The key had slipped in, but didn’t seem to want to turn. Siobhan watched the woman struggle with it a bit as she went on, “The last owner has agreed to provide a repair allowance and to pay closing costs, and the price has been reduced twice.” After a few seconds of frustrating failure, the realtor pulled the key back out, gave it a hard look, and slipped it back in to try to turn it once more. “I don’t know why they never replaced these locks,” she mumbled as she worked. “It isn’t safe to keep locks from owner to owner.” Her purse slipped off of her shoulder and into the crook of her arm. Tendrils of her light blonde hair had slipped from the bun at the nape of her neck to frizz about her face in the early May humidity.  
  
  “How many owners has it had?” Siobhan asked, not really caring how many it had had, but feeling the need to fill the silence with small talk. Jane’s nerves were so frayed, Siobhan could almost see their ends swaying in the breeze.  
  
  “Well…” Jane replied, a little out of breath. “I’d have to double check my notes, but I think it’s had somewhere in the family of a dozen.” She stopped messing with the key a moment, shot Siobhan a half-smile over her shoulder, and added, “It’s an old house.”  
  
  “Would you like some help with that?” Siobhan asked, looking from Jane to the key she clutched tightly in her white fingertips. The realtor glanced down at the key and back up again. Siobhan knew what she was thinking. What made her think that she could make it work when Jane couldn’t?  
  
  “I’m good with old things,” Siobhan said by way of explanation. She shrugged and smiled sheepishly, hoping that would do the trick.  
  
  “Oh,” Jane said. She straightened, pulling the key out of the door. “By all means, give it a shot. Two heads are often better than one.”  
  
  Siobhan held out her hand and the realtor deposited the key in her palm. Her fingers closed over the old metal, at once detecting the slight buzz that came from its surface. It was something Jane wouldn’t pick up. Most humans wouldn’t, in fact. But Siobhan would.  
  
  She gave the realtor a reassuring smile, bent, and slipped the key once more into the troublesome lock. At once, the key turned, almost of its own accord, and the door swung open, pulling away from her grasp.  
  
  Siobhan’s gaze narrowed in irritation on the open doorway. She felt her magic bristle as the cool air from the house’s interior curled out and over the wooden porch around their feet.  
  
  “Wow,” said the realtor, who was busily brushing her dress suit and hair back into place. She hoisted her purse back over her shoulder and gave Siobhan a stiff nod of approval. “You really do have a way with old things.”  
  
  You have no idea, Siobhan thought.  
  
  “Well, come on in,” said Jane, as she stepped past the house’s threshold and into the shadows beyond. Her patent leather pump lost its deep blue color, fading into black in the dim of the interior. “The electricity’s been off for a while now, as you can imagine, but I’ll open some windows and you can at least get an idea of what you’re dealing with.”  
  
  Siobhan followed her inside, her eyes turned up toward the rafters and fuzzy-looking corners filled with cobwebs and holes left by termites. She stifled the urge to laugh. No one in their right mind would buy this house. It wasn’t in need of upkeep. It was in need of a bulldozer.  
  
  But even as she thought so, her eyes strayed to the expertly carved banister that led to the second floor, and she frowned. Okay, she admitted begrudgingly. It doesn’t need a bulldozer.  
  
  It needed her.  
  
  A second later, Jane reappeared in the archway that led to the dining room and kitchen beyond. She was loudly brushing her hands to dust them off, and her hair had once more slipped from her bun. “I got the windows open –”  
  
  “I’ll take it,” Siobhan said before the realtor could say anything further.  
  
  Jane stopped in her tracks and stared at her with wide, blinking eyes.  
  
  Siobhan smiled and shrugged. “When can I move in?”  
  
  \*\*\*\*\*  
  
  She stopped just after she entered the living room and dropped the heavy padded glider chair she’d been carrying. It sent a cloud of dust flying as it clattered noisily to the wooden planks, which Siobhan ignored as she used the back of her forearm to wipe the sweat from her forehead.  
  
  “Not that I mind having you around, Steven, but I have to admit I wish you were solid right now. This crap is heavy.” Siobhan sighed and lowered herself into the glider before resting her head back on the head rest and closing her eyes. She’d sent the police detail away earlier that afternoon. It had been ten days since Steven’s death and she felt conspicuous and strange having cops watching her twenty-four-seven. She also felt guilty. Salem was right next door to Boston as the crow flies. Boston was a big city, often a dangerous city, and there were certainly more useful places for a pair of police officers to be than parked in a car across the street from her new worn-down, still empty home.  
  
  So she was stuck lugging the furniture in on her own, and after four hours of hauling heavy things straight, she was nearly done – and nearly done for.  
  
  She could feel Steven’s ghost hovering beside her to her left.  
  
  Steven’s ghost.  
  
  She’d come home on Monday night a week and a half ago to find her street blocked off by fire trucks and ambulances – and her house on fire. The entire block had smelled like evil.  
  
  Siobhan was a warlock. If anyone in the world understood the power and pull of evil, it was her. She fought it every day.  
  
  Twenty-eight years ago, she’d been born with a penchant for magic. Of course, the skills didn’t make themselves apparent until a number of years later, when at the age of eight, she unwittingly and telekinetically slammed her mother’s fingers in the kitchen drawer because she couldn’t get a word in edge-wise around her numerous brothers and sisters. That got her mother’s attention.  
  
  It also got Siobhan’s. And it felt  
terrible.  
  
  That was the first time her magic had reared its head and caused harm. Since that moment, Siobhan made great effort to retain control over her emotions. Because when she didn’t, bad things happened.  
  
  Several years later, a friend was hosting an Oldies but Goodies movie night and Siobhan watched a very young Drew Barrymore kill people with massive fire balls. She stared at the child on the screen, and felt like an imposter amongst humans. There before her was someone with dangerous magic, magic she could barely control, and it was so fantastical, so unbelievable, it was the basis for a science fiction horror.  
  
  And Siobhan was reminded of herself – and of the secret she’d kept hidden for the duration of her childhood.  
  
  Every now and then, she considered going to a Wiccan coven or something similar and trying to get help. Talking to someone. Trying to figure things out.  
  
  But these witches were so vastly different from Siobhan, the gap between them felt un-breachable. They stressed a philosophy of “harming none,” and all the while, the magic inside of Siobhan begged her to do just the opposite. It was a nasty, volatile kind of magic.  
  
  Siobhan’s power was not a modern day witch’s power. It had nothing to do with cauldrons or herbs or crystals. It was about anger and hatred and revenge…. And…. It was real.  
  
  Day after day, night after night, year after year, Siobhan struggled to get a firm grip on what she was and how to deal with it, and she did so alone. Being the youngest child in a family of four daughters and three sons made her task both more difficult and more simple. Hiding was a constant necessity, but it was like hiding in New York; there was always someone else around to take the attention off of her.  
  
  In high school, she was the attractive but unpopular kid that young adult romance writers loved to pen about now, only at the time, there had been no gorgeous vampire to save her and no strapping werewolf to protect her. It was just her, in a non-stop battle with her own flaring temper and the magic that thrummed through her veins, begging for release.  
  
  The effort was taxing, to say the least. As time went by, the tiring effects of her constant war with herself took different forms, lending her OCD tendencies, a touch of insomnia, and a firm, undying need for at least five cups of strong Irish tea a day.  
  
  Other things happened as well. Little by little, she was made aware of the fourth dimension of reality around her. Life did not consist of humans and animals and then her – different from the others and alone in this difference. Instead, it consisted of humans and animals and magic.  
  
  This magic ran through the veins of supernatural races that she’d once only dreamed of but that now followed her, tracked her down, and noticed her even when no other human did. The first run-in she’d had with one of these races was with an Akyri child.  
  
  A hungry Akyri child.  
  
  Siobhan had been thirteen at the time and the little girl, who must not have been any older than four or five, had looked at Siobhan as if she were a Big Mac at the end of a marathon run. She was starving for magic, and Siobhan’s looked like a feast.  
  
  Over the next fifteen years, Siobhan learned more about these Akyri and their symbiotic relationships with warlocks, and she came to accept that a warlock was what she was. A black magic user.  
  
  Whether she liked it or not.  
  
  Witches and warlocks were not made, not trained, not formed. They were not bred by their environments or nurtured this way or that. They were born. And it was as simple as that. Siobhan had no idea why she possessed the abilities she did while her brothers and sisters seemed devoid of them. She had no idea why they were dark abilities, tainted by wrath the way that old houses were tainted with mold. But that was the hand that life had dealt her, and she came to accept that she would always be struggling with it.  
  
  She didn’t have to struggle of course. She knew this. Her magic reminded her of it over and over again, coaxing her and massaging her and whispering in her ears: Give up. Give in. Let me handle this.  
  
  But if she did, she would become something that deep down in her heart, she didn’t want to be. It just wasn’t her.  
  
  So in the end, she grew more tired every day and relied more and more upon tea and coffee and sleeping in late and tried to distract herself with work. Because she didn’t like to chance losing her temper around someone else, she tried to keep to herself as much as possible, and her “work” consisted of finding antiques, using magic to restore them to pristine and mint condition, and selling them online. She was good at it. It was something about the magic that ran through her veins that lent itself to dealing with things that were past their prime. Old things. Worn out things. Even dead things.  
  
  She’d witnessed a coyote hit by a bus once while she’d been traveling through the Southwest. It had one black leg. A few nights later, she’d found that same black-legged coyote skulking around her car in the motel parking lot. She had no idea how or why. But there it was. Dead things found their way to her. And sometimes, as was the case with the antiques she bought and sold, she brought them back to life.  
  
  She earned an okay living, but the money wasn’t the biggest advantage to doing what she did. It was being able to drive the car she drove – a jet black 1965 Ford Mustang built the first year that Ford began putting bigger, 225 horse power engines in its ponies – as if it were fresh off of the lot. It was being able to wear the same pair of perfect fitting jeans for thirteen years. And it was this house, forgotten, left behind, and crumbling, and what it would look like when her magic was finished with it.  
  
  Siobhan opened her eyes and looked up at the cracked rafters above her. When night fell and lent her a blanket of privacy, a single, powerful spell would fix the house’s interior so quickly and so completely, it would be like turning back time. The exterior, however, would take longer. It wouldn’t do for Siobhan to cast a spell that corrected everything outside all at once. Someone was sure to notice something so drastic.  
  
  Instead, she would repair it little by little, a spell here and a spell there, and a few weeks into it, the neighbors would pass by, glance at her house, and nod their approval at all of the work she’d done to fix up the old Victorian-style manor.  
  
  In the meantime, she needed to give off the appearance of normalcy. And so she lugged her furniture from the van outside into the manor’s dim, cool interior, and marveled at the way no one ever offered to help. She was the stranger in town. She was the one buying the “haunted house,” the “cursed house,” and she was red-headed to boot.  
  
  Siobhan smiled now, sat up straight, and sighed heavily. Beside her, a thin wisp of white energy brushed past her hand, drawing her attention.  
  
  Steven.  
  
  She’d met him six months ago at a coffee shop where he and a few other cops sometimes stopped in for a warm drink and a break. They’d gotten to talking. She’d been impressed with a lot of things about him – his appearance, of course, and the confident way he carried himself. But there was also an untapped power about him; the magic in her recognized it, even if it was altogether human and not magical in and of itself. Most of all, it was the keenness of his eyes.  
  
  And he’d been carrying a dog-eared copy of Macbeth. It seemed like fate.  
  
  He’d watched her with a strange kind of interest, as if he could tell she had a secret and he was dying to know what it was. But there was also a gentleness about him, a smoothing out of his rough edges. He was hard but kind. And she was intrigued.  
  
  They dated for two months before he caught her using magic. She’d been finishing up the final touches on an 18k pocket watch she’d picked up at an auction, and while she thought she’d locked the door, apparently she hadn’t. He walked in while the watch hovered in the air, spinning like a top, becoming increasingly shiny and functional.  
  
  Instead of the insanity she expected to ensue, Steven seemed… almost pleased. As if he’d subconsciously known all along what she was and had simply been waiting for proof.  
  
  He accepted it, he accepted her, and since he was a detective and used to keeping evidence under wraps  
and an orphan with a somewhat blotchy past of his own, he kept her secret, and she trusted him.  
  
  Two months later, they’d become comfortable enough to start staying at each other’s houses. They exchanged keys and left a few belongings behind for “sleepovers.”  
  
  Two months after that, she’d come home to a house on fire and a dead boyfriend.  
  
  And now, a week and a half later, he was a ghost living on the outskirts of her reality, always somewhere nearby but just out of reach. She didn’t know what to make of any of it. She had no idea what to think. What had happened that night? The forensics people, CSI investigators and insurance arson experts had all come up with vague, strange stories and none of them seemed to be able to pinpoint how the fire had started, what had set it off, or how Steven had been trapped within it.  
  
  Because Siobhan had been Steven’s girlfriend and because the house had been hers, she’d been offered a larger amount of police protection than usual. After all, when they’d found Steven’s body and the gun in his hand, they’d discovered that all fifteen bullets had been discharged. There was no point to holding an empty gun, and Steven would have known that better than anyone.  
  
  Someone probably killed him. That was the general consensus.  
  
  It was just that no one could figure out how. Much less, why.  
  
  In the privacy and silence of a hotel room in the dead of night, Siobhan had tried casting a spell that would allow her to see the events that had taken place just prior to the fire, but each time she attempted to use the magic in this way, she failed. She never saw anything. Steven’s death remained a mystery.  
  
  Siobhan frowned and looked up at the faint vapor that moved away from her side, away from her chair, and through the living room. It passed beneath the archway that led out of the joined rooms and disappeared down the hall. Steven’s ghost… most likely checking out the house now that it was getting dark. Always protecting her, even in death.  
  
  Siobhan leaned forward and put her face in her hands, allowing the coolness of her fingers to pull a bit of the heat off of her forehead. She closed her eyes again. There, behind her lids, she saw the flames rising toward the moon and smelled the deep black of soot and felt the heaviness of doom on her chest. There had been very little left of Steven’s body when all was done and said. So even though her warlock’s brain had tiptoed toward the idea of bringing him back from the dead, she’d known it would be impossible. Unthinkable, even.

1mwi6nz,https://i.redd.it/ih7ym5ejvekf1.png,🚨 Zelensky Sets 7-10 Day Ultimatum: No Putin Meeting Without Security Guarantees - Russia Responds With Massive Attack,"Ukrainian President Zelensky just dropped a major bombshell - he's demanding Western security guarantees be finalized within 7-10 days before he'll even consider sitting down with Putin. But here's the kicker: Russia is now demanding veto power over any security arrangements for Ukraine.

The Timeline:

Zelensky wants ""Article 5-like"" NATO protections locked in first

Britain and France are leading a 30-country coalition effort

Trump has committed US participation but ruled out American ground troops

Possible meeting locations: Switzerland, Austria, or Turkey

Russia's Response Was Swift and Brutal:
Just hours after Zelensky's ultimatum, Russia launched one of its largest attacks of the year - 574 drones and 40 missiles overnight. At least 1 killed, 15+ injured, including strikes on:

An American electronics factory (making coffee machines!)

Residential buildings in Lviv

Critical infrastructure across Ukraine

The Catch-22:
Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov says any security talks without Russian input are ""a road to nowhere"". Essentially, Moscow wants to control Ukraine's future defense arrangements - which is exactly what Ukraine is trying to prevent.

Why This Matters:
This could be the make-or-break moment for Trump's peace push. Zelensky is basically saying ""protect us first, then we'll talk"" while Putin is saying ""we get to decide how you're protected.""

The timing of that massive Russian attack right after Zelensky's comments? That's no coincidence.

Sources:

NBC News

The Moscow Times

Institute for the Study of War

Al Jazeera

TL;DR: Zelensky won't meet Putin without ironclad security guarantees in 7-10 days. Russia wants veto power over those guarantees. Russia then launches massive attack. This is getting spicy. 🌶️",5,1755798887.0,TrendoraX,2,0.86,False

1mwi5hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mwi5hu/does_the_hamilton_beach_programmable_coffee_maker/,Does the Hamilton Beach Programmable Coffee Maker 46299 Deserve Its 4.4 Rating Review?,"The Hamilton Beach 46299 Programmable Coffee Maker has become a surprising centerpiece in my morning routine. Initially, I wasn’t sure if a programmable coffee maker would make that much of a difference in my day-to-day life, but over a couple of weeks, I discovered it absolutely does. With a sleek black and stainless steel design that fits perfectly in my modern kitchen, this machine offers more than just good looks. It's packed with practical features that cater to coffee lovers who need their caffeine fix conveniently—and trust me, I fall into that category.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee maker was its clean and modern look. It’s slim enough to fit comfortably on smaller countertops but still substantial enough to handle a 12-cup capacity. The subtle combination of black and stainless steel gives it a professional feel, and the buttons are neatly arranged for easy operation. I appreciate its sleekness because, with so many appliances crowding the kitchen, this one doesn’t scream for attention while still looking stylish.

**Convenience Features**  
I never thought I’d appreciate “programming” a coffee pot until I tried this model. Programming it is simple using the easy-touch system, and let me tell you, waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee is as blissful as it sounds. The auto-pause and serve feature is pure gold for anyone impatient like me—I can sneak a cup mid-brew without ending up with coffee all over the counter. Small touches, such as the cord storage, help keep the countertop tidy, which is incredibly underrated.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)  

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
For a drip coffee machine, it performs admirably. The three brewing strength options—regular, bold, and a smaller ""1-4 cups"" option—mean you can tailor your coffee not only to your mood but the time of day. Sometimes I want the boldness of strong coffee, while other times a lighter brew feels just right. The 2-hour automatic shutoff is immensely comforting for those ""Did I leave the coffee maker on?"" moments. Over weeks of hard use, the heating element has remained consistent, ensuring a perfect temperature every time. However, the brewing process isn’t the quietest I’ve experienced. It’s not intolerable, just louder than some competitors.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Honestly, cleaning appliances can be a pain, but this one was designed for people like me who just want easy maintenance. Both the glass carafe and the brew basket are top-rack dishwasher safe, which is a godsend during a busy week. For manual cleaning, a quick rinse usually does the job. The warming plate is nonstick, so any accidental drips wipe away effortlessly. This practicality has made me way less hesitant to use it consistently.

**Positives**  
- Time your coffee to be ready when you wake up with programmable brewing.  
- Select-A-Brew offers regular, bold, or fewer-cup brewing options.  
- Cleaning is hassle-free with dishwasher-safe components.  

**Weaknesses**  
- Noisier than some competitors during brewing.  
- The included paper filter setup adds a step; reusable filters could be more convenient.

**Other Options**  
If you’re fond of experimenting with different brewing styles, you might look at brands like Cuisinart, which offer models incorporating single-serve or pod systems alongside drip options. Competitors like the Ninja line often come with built-in frother attachments, which cater to latte enthusiasts but at a higher price point. However, for an affordable and self-contained drip coffee maker, the Hamilton Beach unit holds its own. It stands out for its value, especially when compared to cheaper, less durable alternatives. Yet, it doesn’t quite hit the premium sturdiness of some Breville models.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The standout feature here is undoubtedly its price-to-quality ratio. While it may not have extra frills like bean grinding or milk frothing, it focuses on delivering excellent drip coffee every day without fuss. When I compared it to other coffee machines in a similar price range, it became evident that you’re getting fantastic bang for your buck. Its reliability and customization are features you don’t expect at this cost—making it a smart investment for daily coffee drinkers who want a solid brew without overcomplicating things.

Yesterdwy i dumped a large caramel latte straight down my front around 11ish, hot and sticky, i went in the only bathroom to change. i locked it, i was in there like 4 to 5 minutes tops. when i came out an older lady with a guy (think her husband) was there, she was mad and said she couldnt hold it. it sucked, i felt bad but the bathroom was just, in use. fast forward to today, manager called me into the little office by the safe right before my break, made me clock out first which was kinda wild, and said head office reviewed the incident. he said i showed poor service and they are letting me go. i just stared at the wall for a sec bc fired.. over a locked door and a spilled drink.

then i kinda lost it. i said this was messed up, i said you are firing an employee to please one loud customer, i said if a random customer had been in there nothing would happen, i said im not walking out half dressed in front of a dining room. i was covered in coffee and just trying to clean up so i could get back on bar. my hands were shaking and i probably talked too fast, whatever petty, yeah. they asked for my polo, apron, and keys so i gave the shirt and apron, and i just held the keys for a minute, like oh right those, and watched him start to reach for the spare log sheet. then i put them down slow on the desk, said good luck filling weekend shifts if this is how you treat staff then I wiped my name off the whiteboard schedule w my sleeve cause it was still up there for next saturday. i know it was childish but i was mad and embarrased. after, i grabbed my bag from my locker, tossed my coffee stained lanyard, and walked home still smelling like syrup. one coworker said good luck under his breath, another wouldnt even look at me.

now im sitting here wondering if i overreacted. like, i did make a little scene, i did the dumb keys thing, and wiped my name off the board which probably annoyed him. maybe i should of just said ok and left. but i keep thinking, what else was i supposed to do in the first place, teleport out the bathroom half naked.

I usually have debilitating cramps and a ton of rage leading up to my period. Today (I expect to get my period based on my cramps, though they're not as bad as usual), I'm alternating - sometimes quite quickly - between emotional numbness and terrible sadness and depression.

At 11 a.m., I was gasping-sobbing on the couch, just mourning my whole life. Changes, loss, disappointment. I was devastated about literally everything. I'm on the wrong career path, I'm in the wrong relationship, nobody cares for me, I'm running out of time to get it all right, I couldn't get it all right even if I had the energy to try.

At 1 p.m., I was just stood in the middle of my house, staring blankly, feeling nothing but ""stuck"" - not just in life, but in that moment. I have so much to do - very important paperwork to file, work to do, my house is a mess - and it's all I can do to just sit still and continue breathing. I feel like breathing takes effort. My general depression is pretty well managed and I haven't felt this particular brand of depression in so long.

And I just don't want to do anything. I feel incapable of anything productive, but I also don't *want* to do anything - I don't want to watch TV, I don't want to listen to music, I don't want to clean, I don't want to work out, I don't even want to lie here doing nothing. I don't want to exist. 

Life feels hopeless. Nothing feels good.

I don't know if I want to chug some coffee in the hopes that it'll give me the energy to do what I need to do, or smoke a bowl, curl up with my dog, and try to sleep the rest of the day away.

1mwi2td,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1mwi2td/update_im_the_one_who_quit_all_alcohol_sugar/,"UPDATE: I’m the one who quit all alcohol, sugar, caffeine & junk food at the same time due to high triglycerides.","Hi all. Remember me? I’m still alive, so I’ve got that going for me. The moderators said I can’t put a link here to my original post, but if you click on my name, you should be able to find it. 

AN UPDATE: I’m doing much better. The first two weeks of withdrawal were hell. Also, sugar is the Devil. 

Going cold turkey almost killed my 10 year relationship lol.

I’m much, much better now that I’m through withdrawals. I have had no more “episodes” and have kept up with my heart healthy diet.

No refined sugars. No white carbs. No alcohol. No cheese. No junk food (like potato chips) no chocolate and very little red meat. I talked to my doctor and just recently added back some caffeine. 1 cup a day with a splash of milk.

On this heart healthy diet, I am struggling to eat 1500 calories a day. I think I’ve only reached that amount twice in 5 weeks.

I usually end up somewhere around 1200-1300 calories a day and am totally stuffed. I lost 12 lbs in a month. Madness.

Here’s a typical day for me (still refining & evolving):

Breakfast: 100 gram banana & coffee w a splash of low-fat or skim milk. An hour or so later, I’ve been eating a cup of lentil soup with carrots, peas, spinach, garlic and chopped zucchini. Sometimes I’ll have a 100 calorie slice of whole grain bread with it, dry.

Snack: 1 cup of grapes or an apple, sometimes with a schmear of sugar-free peanut butter on a few slices.

This is rare because my lunch is very filling.

Lunch: 1 cup egg whites, 1 cup cooked spinach (from frozen), 1/2 cup mushrooms. 4 tablespoons of salsa roja on top. If I don’t eat that slice of bread for breakfast, I’ll eat it with lunch.

Snack: 1 cup of boiled red cabbage sweetened with Granny Smith and Fuji apples. It’s better than it sounds.

Dinner: 4-5 ounces of oily fish like salmon, grouper, tuna. Sometimes a lean Turkey burger (no bun) or skinless boneless chicken breast. 200 grams potato or yam, skin on, with 75 grams of non-fat Greek yogurt & two vegetables of 2 to 3 servings each: like carrots, zucchini, cauliflower, greens, broccoli or red cabbage. I will add a tablespoon of olive oil sometimes to the baked potato, yam or corn on the cob. No butter.

I currently live in Mexico and have to work with what’s available to me in the grocery stores here. Lots of beans, squash & corn. 

I don’t eat raw produce unless it has a thick skin on it. Absolutely no greens or lettuce w/o cooking them. I’ve had e-coli three times here. No mas!

Snack: blueberries, strawberries, pineapple or other fiber-rich fruit with another 75 grams of Greek Yogurt. It’s a good sub for sour cream in case you’re wondering.

I had a ground turkey taco “bowl” the other night with black beans, corn, avocado and zucchini. It was delicious with the dressing I made for it. 75 grams of Greek yogurt mixed with a tablespoon of salsa verde. Didn’t miss not having any cheese or tortilla chips with it.

This is SO MUCH FOOD. Last night, I couldn’t even finish my dinner. My stomach just clenched up and refused to take on another bite.

I usually hit between 1200-1300 calories a day eating like this.

I’ve been exercising twice a day. 50 minutes in my small pool doing water aerobics type stuff with a pool noodle and then walking my dogs for 30 minutes in the evening when it cools off.

I feel great. Food tastes so much better now that I’m off sugar. I can’t even explain it very well. Imagine if regular carrots started tasting like candied yams overnight. I guess my palate is still adjusting.

My mood is good. I have so much more energy, but I am not sleeping as much as I’d like. Usually 5-6 hrs at night. I don’t know why. I’m tired at night, but I suppose it could still just be part of the adjustment period for my new lifestyle and eating habits.

Also, I don’t poop much lol. Hey, you guys wanted updates! 🤣

I used to get big time blood sugar dips before. Hangry! Those are gone now.

Never in my life have I had to force myself to eat, but here we are. I have 7 more weeks before I go back in for new bloodwork. I’m hoping to be down 20 lbs total and that the results are good so I can possibly start adding back in a few foods, like 20 grams of cheese occasionally or some dark chocolate, but if not, I’m okay with it.

There is no “cheating” on this diet because I know my blood tests won’t lie for me. And I don’t want to take cholesterol pills for the rest of my life. I want my doctor to tell me that I no longer have a fatty liver & my triglycerides are perfect. And that I will never have another nightmare episode like I did 5 weeks ago.

I track, weigh & measure all my food on a fitness app so I know I’m getting my macros. The lentils & spinach alone give me 90% of my iron for the day before I eat anything else. I’m getting plenty of vitamins from all the veg. Healthy oils from the fish. Fiber overload from the 7-10 servings of fruit & veg I eat everyday.
I’m good and I hope all of you are, too.

I’ll check in again with you when I get my new quest results back.

Thanks again for all the support. I still go back and read your messages from my original post when I’m feeling down or discouraged.

1mwi20n,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mwi20n/the_butterfly_garden_novel_by_dot_hutchison_free/,The Butterfly Garden Novel by Dot Hutchison Free Read online,"The techs tell him the girl on the other side of the glass hasn’t said a word since they brought her in. It doesn’t surprise him at first, not with the traumas she’s been through, but watching her now from behind the one-way mirror, he starts to question that assessment. She sits slumped in the hard metal chair, chin resting on one bandaged hand as the other traces nonsense symbols onto the surface of the stainless steel table. Her eyes are half-closed, deep shadows bruising the skin beneath, and her black hair is dull and unwashed, scraped back into a messy knot. She’s exhausted, clearly.  
  
  But he wouldn’t call her traumatized.  
  
  Sipping his coffee, FBI Special Agent Victor Hanoverian studies the girl and waits for his team members to arrive. At least his partner, anyway. The third core member of their team is at the hospital with the other girls, trying to get updates on their conditions and—when possible—their names and fingerprints. Other agents and techs are at the property, and what little he’s heard from them makes him want to call home and talk to his own daughters, make sure they’re well. But he has a way with people, especially traumatized children, so it’s the sensible choice for him to be here, waiting to go in and talk to this particular victim.  
  
  He can see the faint pink lines around her nose and mouth from an oxygen mask, smudges of dirt and soot across her face and borrowed clothing. Bandages wrap around her hands and her upper left arm, and he can trace the bulky line of others beneath the thin undershirt someone at the hospital gave her to wear. She shivers in the off-green scrub pants, her bare feet pulled away from the cold floor, but doesn’t complain.  
  
  He doesn’t even know her name.  
  
  He doesn’t know the names of most of the girls they rescued, or the ones they were far, far too late to save. This one hasn’t talked to anyone but the other girls, and even then there were no names, no information. Just . . . well, he can’t really call it comfort. “You’ll die or you won’t, now relax for the doctors so they can work” wasn’t exactly reassuring, but that’s exactly how the other girls seemed to take it.  
  
  She sits up in the chair, her arms extending slowly over her head until her entire back is curved like a bowstring. The mics pick up the painful pop of vertebrae. Shaking her head, she slumps back over the table, her cheek pressed against the metal, her palms flat against the surface. She’s facing away from the glass, away from him and the others she knows must be there, but the angle offers another piece of interest: the lines.  
  
  The hospital gave him a picture of it; he can see just the edges of those brilliant colors peeking out against the back of her shoulder. The rest of the design is harder to see, but the undershirt isn’t thick enough to obscure it completely. He pulls the picture from his pocket and holds it up against the glass, looking between the glossy paper and what he can see of the design on the girl’s back. It wouldn’t be significant except that all but one of the girls have them. Different colors, different designs, but all the same in essentials.  
  
  “You think he did that to them, sir?” asks one of the techs, watching the girl on the monitor. That camera is aimed from the other side of the interview room, showing an enlarged view of her face, her eyes closed, her breaths slow and deep.  
  
  “I guess we’ll find out.” He doesn’t like to make suppositions, especially when they know so little yet. This is one of the very few times in his career where what they found is so much worse than they could have envisioned. He’s accustomed to thinking the worst. When a child goes missing, you work your ass off but don’t expect to find the poor thing alive at the end of it. Maybe you hope. You don’t expect. He’s seen bodies so small it’s a wonder there are even coffins to fit them, seen children raped before they know the meaning of the word, but somehow this case is so unexpected he isn’t quite sure where his footing is.  
  
  He doesn’t even know how old she is. The doctors guessed sixteen to twenty-two, but that doesn’t help him much. As young as sixteen, she should probably have a representative from child services, but they’ve already swarmed the hospital and made things difficult. They have valuable and necessary services to provide—but that doesn’t get them out of his way. He tries to think of his daughters, what they would do if they were locked in a room like this girl, but none of them are this self-contained. Does that mean she’s older? Or just that she’s had more practice seeming unaffected?  
  
  “Have we heard more from Eddison or Ramirez yet?” he asks the techs, not taking his eyes off the girl.  
  
  “Eddison’s on his way up; Ramirez is still at the hospital with the parents of the youngest girl,” one of the women reports. Yvonne doesn’t look at the girl in the room, not even at the monitors. She has an infant daughter at home. Victor wonders if he should pull her off—this is only her first day back—but decides she’ll say something if she can’t handle it.  
  
  “She was the one who triggered the search?”  
  
  “Only been gone a couple of days. Disappeared from the mall while shopping with her friends. They said she went out of the dressing room area to switch sizes and never came back.”  
  
  One less person to find.  
  
  They’d taken pictures at the hospital of all the girls, even the ones who’d died en route or on arrival, and were running them through the missing persons database. It will take time for results to come up, though. When agents or doctors asked the ones in better shape for their names, they turned to look at this girl, clearly a leader among them, and most said nothing. A few seemed to think about it before dissolving into sobs that brought the nurses running.  
  
  But not this girl in the interview room. When they asked her, she just turned away. As far as anyone can tell, this is one girl with no interest in being found.  
  
  Which makes some of them wonder if she’s a victim at all.  
  
  Victor sighs and drains the last of his coffee, crushing the cup before tossing it in the trash bucket by the door. He’d prefer to wait for Ramirez; another female in the room is always helpful in circumstances like this. Can he wait for her? There’s no telling how long she’ll be with the parents, or if other parents will flock to the hospital once the photos are released to the media. If they’re released to the media, he amends with a frown. He hates that part, hates plastering the pictures of victims across television screens and newspapers so there’s never a way for them to forget what happened to them. At least they can wait until they get the missing persons data.  
  
  The door opens and slams shut again behind him. The room is soundproof but the glass rattles slightly and the girl sits up quickly, eyes narrowed at the mirror. And, presumably, the ones she has to know are beh  
ind it.  
  
  Victor doesn’t turn around. No one slams a door quite like Brandon Eddison. “Anything?”  
  
  “They’ve matched a couple of fairly recent reports, and the parents are on their way. So far it’s all East Coast.”  
  
  Victor pulls the picture from the glass and puts it back into the pocket of his jacket. “Anything else on our girl?”  
  
  “Some of the others called her Maya after she was brought here. No last name.”  
  
  “Real name?”  
  
  Eddison snorts. “Doubtful.” He struggles to zip his jacket over his Redskins T-shirt. Once the response team found the survivors, Victor’s team was called in from off duty to handle it. Given Eddison’s tastes, Victor’s mostly grateful there are no naked women on the shirt. “We’ve got a team going through the main house to see if the bastard kept anything personal.”  
  
  “I think we can both agree that he kept some very personal things of theirs.”  
  
  Perhaps remembering what he saw at the property, Eddison doesn’t argue. “Why this one?” he asks. “Ramirez says there are others not too badly injured. More frightened, maybe more willing to talk. This one looks like a tough nut.”  
  
  “The other girls look to her. I want to know why. They must be desperate to get home, so why do they look at her and choose not to answer questions?”  
  
  “You think she might be part of this?”  
  
  “That’s what we need to find out.” Picking up the bottle of water from the counter, Victor takes a deep breath. “All right. Let’s go talk to Maya.”  
  
  She sits back in the chair when they walk into the interview room, gauze-covered fingers laced together across her stomach. It’s not as defensive a posture as he would expect, and it’s clear from his partner’s scowl that he’s thrown by it as well. Her eyes flick over them, taking in details and filing away thoughts, none of which show on her face.  
  
  “Thank you for coming with us,” he greets her, glossing over the lack of choice she’d been given. “This is Special Agent Brandon Eddison, and I’m Special Agent in Charge Victor Hanoverian.”  
  
  The corner of her mouth ticks upward in a fleeting movement he can’t really call a smile. “Special Agent in Charge Victor Hanoverian,” she repeats, her voice hoarse with smoke. “Quite a mouthful.”  
  
  “Would you prefer Victor?”  
  
  “I don’t really have a preference, but thank you.”  
  
  He unscrews the cap and hands her the bottle of water, using the moment to adjust his strategy. Definitely not traumatized, and not shy either. “Usually there’s another part to the introductions.”  
  
  “The helpful tidbits?” she says. “You like to weave baskets and take long swims, and Eddison likes to walk the streets in heels and a mini?”  
  
  Eddison growls and slams a fist onto the table. “What is your name?”  
  
  “Don’t be rude.”  
  
  Victor bites his lip against the temptation to smile. It won’t help the situation—certainly won’t help his partner’s state of mind—but the temptation is there just the same. “Would you please tell us your name?”  
  
  “Thank you, but no. I don’t believe I care to share that.”  
  
  “Some of the girls called you Maya.”  
  
  “Then why did you bother to ask?”  
  
  He hears Eddison’s sharp intake of breath, but ignores it. “We’d like to know who you are, how you came here. We’d like to help you get home.”  
  
  “And if I said I don’t need your help to get home?”  
  
  “I’d wonder why you didn’t get home before this.”  
  
  There’s a not-quite smile, and a flicker of an eyebrow that might be approval. She’s a beautiful girl, with golden-brown skin and pale brown, nearly amber eyes, but she’s not soft. A smile will have to be earned. “I think we both know the answer to that. But I’m not in there anymore, am I? I can get home from here.”  
  
  “And where is home?”  
  
  “I’m not sure if it’s there anymore.”  
  
  “This isn’t a game,” Eddison snaps.  
  
  The girl appraises him coolly. “No, of course not. People are dead, lives are ruined, and I’m sure you were very inconvenienced at having to leave your football game.”  
  
  Eddison flushes, tugging the zipper up higher over his shirt.  
  
  “You don’t seem all that nervous,” Victor notes.  
  
  She shrugs and takes a sip of the water, holding the bottle gingerly in her bandaged hands. “Should I be?”  
  
  “Most people are when talking to the FBI.”  
  
  “It’s not that different from talking with—” She bites her chapped lower lip, winces at the beads of blood that seep through the cracked skin. She takes another sip.  
  
  “With?” he prompts gently.  
  
  “Him,” she answers. “The Gardener.”  
  
  “The man who held you—you talked with his gardener?”  
  
  She shakes her head. “He was the Gardener.”  
  
  You have to understand, I didn’t give him that name out of fear or reverence, or some misguided sense of propriety. I didn’t give him that name at all. Like anything else in that place, it was made up out of the whole cloth of our ignorance. What wasn’t known was created, what wasn’t created eventually ceased to matter. It’s a form of pragmatism, I suppose. Warm, loving people who desperately need approval from others fall victim to Stockholm syndrome, while the rest of us fall to pragmatism. Having seen both sides in others, I’m for pragmatism.  
  
  I heard the name my first day in the Garden.  
  
  I came to with a splitting headache, a hundred times worse than any hangover I’d ever experienced. I couldn’t even open my eyes at first. Pain lanced through my skull with every breath, let alone movement. I must have made a sound because suddenly there was a cool, damp cloth over my forehead and eyes and a voice promising that it was only water.  
  
  I wasn’t sure which unnerved me more: the fact that this was obviously a frequent concern for her, or the fact that it was a her at all. There’d been no woman in the pair that kidnapped me, of that much I was sure.  
  
  An arm slid behind my shoulders, gently pulling me upright, and a hand pressed a glass against my lips. “Just water, I promise,” she said again.  
  
  I drank. It didn’t really matter if it was “just water” or not.  
  
  “Can you swallow pills?”  
  
  “Yes,” I whispered, and even that much sound drove another nail through my skull.  
  
  “Open up, then.” When I obeyed, she placed two flat pills on my tongue and brought the water up again. I swallowed obediently, then tried not to vomit when she gently lowered me back to a cool sheet and a firm mattress. She didn’t say anything else for a long time, not until the colored lights stopped dancing across the backs of my eyelids and I started to move of my own volition. Then she pulled away the cloth across my face, shielding my eyes from the overhead light until I could stop blinking.  
  
  “So you’ve done this a few times before,” I croaked.  
  
  She handed me the glass of water.  
  
  Even folded over on herself, on a stool beside the bed, it was easy to see that she was tall. Tall and sinewy with long legs and lean muscles like an Amazon. Or a lioness, really, because she slumped bonelessly like a cat. Tawny gold hair was piled atop her head in some fancy nonsense, revealing a face with strong architecture and deep brown eyes with flecks of gold. She wore a silky, black dress that tied high around her neck.  
  
  She accepted my frank appraisal with something like relief. I suppose it was better than shrieking hysterics, which she’d probably gotten before.  
  
  “I’m called Lyonette,” she said when I’d looked my fill and given my attention back to the water. “Don’t bother telling me your name because I won’t be able to use it. Best to forget it, if you can.”  
  
  “Where are we?”  
  
  “The Garden.”  
  
  “The Garden?”  
  
  She shrugged, and even that was a fluid gesture, something graceful rather than inelegant. “It’s as good a name for it as any. Do you want to see it?”  
  
  “I don’t suppose you know a shor  
tcut to a way out of here?”  
  
  She just looked at me.  
  
  Right. I swung my legs over the edge of the bed, planted my fists on the mattress, and realized I could see every bit of me there was to see. “Clothing?”  
  
  “Here.” She handed me a piece of silky, black something that proved to be a slinky, knee-length dress that came high around the neck and low on the back. Really low. If I’d had dimples on my ass, she’d’ve been seeing them. She helped me tie the ropy sash around my hips, then gave me a gentle push toward the doorway.  
  
  The room was plain, severely so, with nothing in it but the bed and a small toilet and sink in one corner. In another corner was what seemed to be a tiny open shower. The walls were made of thick glass, with a doorway in place of a door, and there was a track on either side of the glass.  
  
  Lyonette saw me looking at the track marks and scowled. “Solid walls come down to keep us in our rooms and out of sight,” she explained.  
  
  “Often?”  
  
  “Sometimes.”  
  
  The doorway opened into a narrow hallway, running along to my right, but only a short way on my left before it hit a corner. Almost directly across from the doorway was another entryway with more of that tracking—it led into a cave, damp and cool. An open arch on the far side of the cave brought breezes running through the dark stone space, bits of light catching in the waterfall that babbled and churned just outside. Lyonette led me out from behind the curtain of water into a garden so beautiful it nearly hurt to look at it. Brilliant flowers of every conceivable color bloomed in a riotous profusion of leaves and trees, clouds of butterflies drifting through them. A man-made cliff rose above us, more greenery and trees alive on its flat top, and the trees on the edges just brushed the sides of the glass roof that loomed impossibly far away. I could see tall black walls through the lower-level greenery, too tall to see what was beyond, and little pockets of open space surrounded by vines. I thought they might be doorways to halls like the one we’d been in.  
  
  The atrium was massive, almost overwhelming in its sheer size before you even looked at the riot of color. The waterfall fed into a narrow stream that meandered down to a small pond decked in water lilies, white sand paths tracking through the greenery to those other doors.  
The light through the ceiling was deep lavender and streaked through with rose and indigo—evening. It had been bright afternoon when I was taken, but somehow I didn’t think it was the same day. I turned in a slow circle, trying to take it all in, but it was too much. My eyes couldn’t see half of what was there, and my brain couldn’t process half of what I saw.  
  
  “The fuck?”  
  
  Lyonette actually laughed, a hard sound that abruptly cut short as though she were afraid anyone might hear it. “We call him the Gardener,” she said dryly. “Apt, no?”  
  
  “What is this place?”  
  
  “Welcome to the Butterfly Garden.”  
  
  I turned to ask her what that meant, but then I saw it.  
  
  She takes a long sip of water, rolling the bottle across her palms. When she shows no signs of continuing, Victor gently taps the table to get her attention. “It?” he prompts.  
  
  She doesn’t answer.  
  
  Victor pulls the photo from his jacket pocket, laying it on the table between them. “It?” he asks again.  
  
  “See, asking me questions to which you already know the answer doesn’t make me inclined to trust you.” But her shoulders relax and she leans back into the seat, on familiar footing.  
  
  “We’re the FBI; usually people think we’re the good guys.”  
  
  “And Hitler thought he was evil?”  
  
  Eddison lurches to the very edge of his seat. “You’re comparing the FBI to Hitler?”  
  
  “No, I’m engaging in a discussion about perspective and moral relativity.”  
  
  When they got the call, Ramirez went straight to the hospital, and Victor came here to coordinate the deluge of incoming information. Eddison was the one to tour the property. Eddison always reacts to horror with temper. And with that thought, Victor flicks his eyes back to the girl on the other side of the table. “Did it hurt?”  
  
  “Like hell,” she answers, tracing the lines on the photo.  
  
  “The hospital says it’s a few years old?”  
  
  “You make that sound like a question.”  
  
  “A statement seeking confirmation,” he clarifies, and this time the smile creeps out.  
  
  Eddison scowls at him.  
  
  “Hospitals are many things, but completely incompetent doesn’t tend to be one of them.”  
  
  “And what the hell does that mean?” snaps Eddison.  
  
  “Yes, it’s a few years old.”  
  
  He recognizes the patterns now from years of asking his daughters about report cards and tests and boyfriends. He lets the silence hang for a minute, then two, and watches the girl carefully flip the photo over. The shrinks on the larger team would probably have a thing or three to say about that. “Who did he have do it?”  
  
  “The one person in the world he could trust without reservation.”  
  
  “Multi-talented man.”  
  
  “Vic—”  
  
  Without taking his eyes from the girl, Victor kicks the leg of his partner’s chair, jarring him. He’s rewarded with that suggestion of a smile. Not the real thing, not even a ghost of it really, but something like it.  
  
  The girl peeks under the edge of the gauze taped around her fingers, fashioned like gloves rather than mitts. “The needles make a hell of a sound, don’t they? When it’s not what you choose? But it is a choice, because there is the alternative.”  
  
  “Death,” Victor guesses.  
  
  “Worse.”  
  
  “Worse than death?”  
  
  But Eddison pales and the girl sees, and rather than mocking him for it, she gives him a solemn nod. “He knows. But then, you haven’t been there, have you? Reading about it isn’t the same.”  
  
  “What’s worse than death, Maya?”  
  
  She scrapes a nail under one of the fresh scabs on her index finger, peeling it away so dots of blood blossom against the gauze. “You’d be amazed at how easy it is to get tattoo equipment.”  
  
  For the first week, there was something slipped into my dinner each night to make me docile. Lyonette stayed with me during the days, but the other girls—of which there were apparently more than a few—stayed away. This was normal, she told me when I remarked on it over lunch.  
  
  “The weeping thing stresses everyone out,” she said around a mouthful of salad. Whatever else could be said of the mysterious Gardener, he provided excellent meals. “Most prefer to stay out of it until we know how a girl’s going to settle in.”  
  
  “Except for you.”  
  
  “Someone has to do it. I can put up with the tears if I have to.”  
  
  “Then how grateful you must be that I haven’t provided you with any.”  
  
  “About that.” Lyonette stabbed a strip of grilled chicken and twirled her fork. “Have you cried at all?”  
  
  “Would there be a point to doing so?”  
  
  “I’m either going to love you or hate you.”  
  
  “Let me know, I’ll try to behave accordingly.”  
  
  She gave me a fierce smile, all her teeth showing. “Keep that attitude, but don’t do it with him.”  
  
  “Why does he want me sleeping at night?”  
  
  “Precautionary measures. There’s a cliff right outside, after all.”  
  
  Which made me wonder how many girls had thrown themselves over before he implemented those precautionary measures. I tried to gauge the height of the man-made monstrosity. Twenty-five, maybe thirty feet? Was that high enough to kill someone on impact?  
  
  I’d grown accustomed to waking up in that empty room when the drugs wore off, Lyonette sitting on a stool beside the bed. But, at the end of the first week, I woke up on my stomach on a bench with hard padding and the astringent smell of antiseptic thick in the air. It was a different room, larger, with metal walls rather than glass.  
  
  And it had someone else in it.  
  
  I couldn’t see at first, not with the drugged sleep still seaming my eyelids together, but I could feel someone else there. I kept my breathing slow and even, straining to hear, but a hand settled on my bare calf. “I know you’re awake.”  
  
  It was a man’s voice, midrange and cultured with a Mid-Atlantic cast to it. A pleasant voice. The hand smoothed up my leg, over my ass, and along the curve of my back. Goose bumps prickled in its wake, despite the warmth of the room.  
  
  “I’d prefer for you to lie very still, otherwise we’ll both have cause to regret it.” When I tried to turn my head toward his voice, the hand moved to the back of my skull to keep me still. “I would prefer not to bind you for this; it ruins the line of the work. If you feel you cannot remain motionless, I will give you something that will guarantee it. Again, I would prefer not to. Can you be still?”  
  
  “For?” I asked, almost in a whisper.  
  
  He tucked a glossy-smooth piece of paper into my hand.  
  
  I tried to open my eyes but sleep meds always made them gunk up more than usual in the morning. “If you’re not going to start right now, may I please sit up?”  
  
  The hand stroked my hair, the fingernails scraping lightly against my scalp. “You may,” he said, sounding startled. He did, however, help me sit up on the bench. I rubbed the crystals from my eyes and looked down at the picture in my hand, aware of how his hand kept caressing my hair. I thought of Lyonette, of the other girls I’d seen from a distance, and I couldn’t say I was surprised.  
  
  Creeped out, but not surprised.  
  
  He stood behind me, the air around him filled with a spicy cologne. Understated, probably pricy. In front of me was a full tattooist’s setup, the inks arrayed on a standing tray. “It won’t be the full design today.”  
  
  “Why do you mark us?”  
  
  “Because a garden must have its butterflies.”  
  
  “Any chance we could leave that metaphorical?”  
  
  He laughed, a full, easy sound. This was a man who loved to laugh and didn’t find as much cause to do it as he’d like, and was therefore always delighted by the opportunity. You learn things over time, and that was one of the biggest things I learned about him. He wanted to find more joy in life than he did. “Small wonder my Lyonette likes you. You are a fierce spirit, much like she is.”  
\>  
  I didn’t have an answer to that, nothing that made sense to say.  
  
  He carefully hooked his fingers through my hair, pulling it back over my shoulders, and picked up a brush. He worked it through my hair until there wasn’t a single knot to be found, and even after. I think he enjoyed it as much as anything else, really. It’s a simple pleasure, brushing someone else’s hair. Being allowed to. Eventually he pulled it into a ponytail and wrapped it with an elastic, then coiled it into a heavy bun and secured it with a scrunchie and rubber-tipped pins.  
  
  “Back onto your stomach now, please.”  
  
  I obeyed, and as he moved away I caught a glimpse of pressed khakis and a button-down shirt. He turned my head to face away from him, my cheek pressed against the black leather, and placed my arms loosely at my sides. It wasn’t quite comfortable, but wasn’t direly uncomfortable either. When I steeled myself not to jump or flinch, he lightly slapped my rear. “Relax,” he instructed. “If you tense, it will hurt more and take longer to heal.”  
  
  I took a deep breath and forced my muscles to unclench. I curled and uncurled my fists, and with each uncurl I released a bit more tension from my back. Sophia taught us that, mainly to keep Whitney from her periodic breakdowns, and—  
  
  “Sophia? Whitney? These are some of the girls?” Eddison interrupts.  
  
  “They’re girls, yes. Well, Sophia probably counts as a woman.” The girl takes another sip, eyes the quantity left in the bottle. “Actually, Whitney would too, I guess. So they’re women.”  
  
  “What do they look like? We can match their names to—”  
  
  “They’re not from the Garden.” It’s hard to interpret the look she gives the younger agent, equal parts pity, amusement, and derision. “I had a life before, you know. Life didn’t begin at the Garden. Well, not this Garden anyway.”  
  
  Victor turns the photo over, trying to calculate how long such a thing must have taken. So large, so much detail.  
  
  “It wasn’t all at once,” the girl tells him, following his eyes to the pattern. “He started with the outlines. Then he went back in over the course of two weeks to add in all the color and detail. And when it was done, there I was, just another one of the Butterflies in his Garden. God creating his own little world.”  
  
  “Tell us about Sophia and Whitney,” Victor says, content to leave the tattoo for a time. He has a feeling what happened when it was done, and he’s willing to call himself a coward if it means not hearing it yet.  
  
  “I lived with them.”  
  
  Eddison tugs the Moleskine from his pocket. “Where?”  
  
  “In our apartment.”  
  
  “You need—”  
  
  Victor cuts him off. “Tell us about the apartment.”  
  
  “Vic,” Eddison protests. “She’s not giving us anything!”  
  
  “She will,” he answers. “When she’s ready.”  
  
  The girl watches them without comment, sliding the bottle from hand to hand like a hockey puck.  
  
  “Tell us about the apartment,” he says again.  
  
  There were eight of us who lived there, all of us working together at the restaurant. It was a huge loft apartment, all one room, with beds and footlockers laid out like a barracks. Each bed had a hanging rack for clothing on one side, and rods for curtains on the other side and at the foot of the bed. It wasn’t much for privacy but it worked well enough. Under normal circumstances rent would have been hellish, but it was a shit neighborhood and there were so many of us that you could make your rent in a night or two and call the rest of the month spending money.  
  
  Some even did.  
  
  We were a strange mix, students and hoydens and a retired hooker. Some wanted the freedom to be anyone they wanted, some of us wanted the freedom to be left alone. The only things we had in common were working at the restaurant and living together.  
  
  And honestly? It was kind of like heaven.  
  
  Sure, we clashed sometimes, there were arguments and fights and occasional pettiness, but for the most part those things blew over pretty quickly. Someone was always willing to loan you a dress or a pair of shoes or a book. There was work, classes for those who took them, but otherwise we had money and an entire city at our feet. Even for me, who grew up with minimal supervision, that kind of freedom was wonderful.  
  
  The fridge was kept stocked with bagels, booze, and bottled water, and there were always condoms and aspirin in the cabinets. Sometimes you could find leftover takeout in the fridge, and whenever social services came to visit Sophia, and see how she was improving, we made a grocery run and hid the booze and condoms. Mostly we ate out or had things delivered. Working around food every night, we generally avoided the apartment kitchen like the plague.  
  
  Oh, and the drunk guy. We were never sure if he actually lived in the building or not, but in the afternoons we’d see him drinking in the street and every night he’d pass out in front of our door. Not the building door—our door. He was a fucking pervert too, so when we came back after dark—which was pretty much every night—we took the stairs all the way up to the roof and then came down one floor on the fire escape to come in through the windows. Our landlord put a special lock on there for us because Sophia felt bad for the drunk pervert and didn’t want to turn him over to the cops. Given her situation—retired hooker–drug addict cleaning up to try to get her kids back—the rest of us didn’t push.  
  
  The girls were my first friends. I suppose I’d met people like them before but it was different. I could stay away from people and usually did. But I worked with the girls and then I lived with them, and it was just . . . different.  
  
  There was Sophia, who mothered everyone and had managed to be completely clean for over a year when I met her, and that was after two years of trying and slipping. She had the two most beautiful daughters, and they’d actually been kept together in the same foster home. Even better, the foster parents fully supported Sophia’s goal of earning them back. They let her come see the girls pretty much whenever she wanted. Whenever things got rough, whenever the addiction started screaming again, one of us would stuff her in a taxi to see her girls and remind her what she was working so hard for.  
  
  There was Hope, and her little stooge Jessica. Hope was the one with the ideas, with the vivacity, and Jessica went along with everything she said and did. Hope filled the apartment with laughter and sex, and if Jessica used sex as a way to feel better about herself, at least Hope showed her how to have some fun with it. They were the babies, only sixteen and seventeen when I moved in.  
  
  Amber was also seventeen, but unlike the other two, she had a bit of a plan. She got herself declared an emancipated minor so she could get out of the foster system, took her GED, and was taking classes at a community college to get her AA until she could figure out a major. There was Kathryn, a couple of years older, who never, ever talked about life before the apartment. Or about much of anything, really. Kathryn could sometimes be prevailed upon to go with the rest of us to do something, but she never did anything on her own. If someone lined all eight of us against a wall and asked who was running from something or someone, a person would point to Kathryn every time. We didn’t ask her, though. One of the basic rules of the apartment was that we didn’t push on personal history. We all had baggage.  
  
  Whitney I mentioned, she of the periodic breakdowns. She was a grad student in psychology, but was so fucking high-strung. Not in a bad way, just in an “I don’t react to stress well” kind of way. Between semesters she was fantastic. During semesters we all took turns getting her to chill the fuck out. Noémie was also a student, getting one of the most useless degrees known to man. Really, I think the only reason she was going to college was because she had scholarships and getting an English degree gave her an excuse to read a lot. Luckily, she was very generous in sharing her books.  
  
  Noémie was the one who mentioned the apartment to me my second week at the restaurant. It was my third week in the city and I was still living at a hostel, bringing all my worldly possessions to work with me every day. We were in the tiny staff room, changing out o  
f our uniforms. I kept mine at the restaurant just in case my stuff got stolen while I was sleeping, so at least I’d still be able to work. Everyone else changed there because the uniform—a long dress and heels—just wasn’t the sort of thing they pranced around in on their way home.  
  
  “So, um . . . you’re pretty trustworthy, right?” she said with no preamble. “I mean, you don’t stiff the busboys or hostess, you don’t steal anyone’s stuff from the staff room. You never smell of drugs or anything.”  
  
  “Does this have a point?” I pulled on my bra and fastened the hooks behind me, rearranging my breasts to fit. Living in a hostel gave you a certain lack of modesty, one reinforced by the tiny staff room and the number of female employees who had to change there.  
  
  “Rebekah said you’re just a step up from the street. You know a bunch of us live together, right? Well, we’ve got an extra bed.”  
  
  “She’s serious,” called Whitney, fluffing her red-gold hair out of its braided bun. “It’s a bed.”  
  
  “And a footlocker,” giggled Hope.  
  
  “But we’ve been talking about it and wondered if you’d like to move in. Rent would be three hundred a month, includes utilities.”  
  
  I hadn’t been in the city that long but even I knew that was impossible. “Three hundred? The hell you get for three hundred?”  
  
  “Rent is two thousand,” Sophia corrected. “Share of rent would be three hundred. The extra is what covers the utilities.”  
  
  That sounded about right, except . . . “How many of you live there?”  
  
  “You would make eight.”  
  
  Which wouldn’t make it that different from living in the hostel, really. “Can I stay with you tonight and see it, and decide tomorrow?”  
  
  “Sounds great!” Hope handed me a denim skirt that looked barely long enough to cover my underwear.  
  
  “That’s not mine.”  
  
  “I know, but I think it would look really cute on you.” She was already one leg into my overlarge corduroys, so rather than argue, I shimmied into the skirt and decided to be very careful in bending over. Hope was curvy as hell, running a little to plump, so I could pull the skirt low on my hips for a little extra length.

1mwi1mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mwi1mb/adderall_tolerance/,Adderall Tolerance?,"Hello all! I was diagnosed with ADHD late in life and started taking Adderall about a year ago. I started on ER and felt AMAZING. It’s like all of the brain fog, lethargy, and depression disappeared overnight—it was life changing. 

After about half a year, I decided to try out IR because I’d sometimes forget to take ER first thing in the morning and would have a hard time sleeping at night. (Went from 20 mg ER to two 10 mg IR. I took the first IR as soon as I woke up and the other at noon). I did well with this transition, but I noticed over time that I felt the effects less and less to a point where taking it was the equivalent to having a sip of coffee.

As an experiment, I decided to take two 10 mg IR first thing in the morning and one 10 mg IR at 12-2 pm. By doing this, I felt the effects that I felt the first time around and have been much happier and more functional throughout the day. The only thing is that I’m concerned that I will get used to this dosage again and have to explore other options. I’m also worried because 30 mg is already nearing the max prescription and I don’t know if taking this much or more would be harmful to my body. 

I know there isn’t a direct question, but I’m open to tips and advice!

TL;DR - I worry that my tolerance to Adderall will get higher with time and that it won’t work for me anymore.",2,1755798568.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1mwhzfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mwhzfk/first_family_a_novel_by_david_baldacci_free_read/,First Family A Novel by David Baldacci Free Read online,"CHAPTER 1  
  
  BIRTHDAY BALLOONS and submachine guns. Elegant forks digging into creamy goodies while toughened fingers coiled around curved metal trigger guards. Gleeful laughter as gifts were unwrapped floated into the air alongside the mena  
cing thump-thump of an arriving chopper’s downward prop wash.  
  
  The facility was officially designated by the Defense Department as Naval Support Facility Thurmont, yet most Americans knew it as Camp David. Under either name, it was not a typical venue for a preteen’s birthday party. A former recreation camp built by the WPA during the Great Depression, it was turned into the presidential retreat and named the U.S.S. Shangri-La by FDR, because it was essentially replacing the presidential yacht. It had acquired its current and far less exotic moniker from Dwight Eisenhower, who named it after his grandson.  
  
  The hundred-and-thirty-acre property was rustic and had many outdoor pursuits, including tennis courts, hiking trails, and exactly one practice hole for presidential golfers. The birthday party was in the bowling center. A dozen kids were in attendance along with appropriate chaperones. They were all understandably excited about being on hallowed ground where the likes of Kennedy and Reagan had trod.  
  
  The chief chaperone and planner of the event was Jane Cox. It was a role she was accustomed to because Jane Cox was married to Dan Cox, also known as “Wolfman,” which made her the First Lady of the United States. It was a role she handled with charm, dignity, and the necessary elements of both humor and cunning. While it was true that the president of the United States was the world’s ultimate juggler of tasks, it was also a fact that the First Lady, traditionally, was no slouch in that department either.  
  
  For the record, she bowled a ninety-seven without gutter bumpers while wearing patriotic red, white, and blue bowling shoes. She clamped her shoulder-length brown hair back into a ponytail and carried out the cake herself. She led the singing of “Happy Birthday” for her niece, Willa Dutton. Willa was small for her age, with dark hair. She was a bit shy but immensely bright and wonderfully engaging when one got to know her. Though she would never admit it publicly of course, Willa was Jane’s favorite niece.  
  
  The First Lady didn’t eat any cake; Jane was watching her figure since the rest of the country, and indeed the world, was too. She’d put on a few pounds since entering the White House. And a few pounds after that on the hell-on-a-plane they called the reelection campaign her husband was currently engaged in. She was five-eight in flats, tall enough that her clothes hung well on her. Her husband was an inch shy of six feet and thus she never wore heels high enough to make him look shorter by comparison. Perception did matter and people liked their leaders taller and more robust than the rest of the population.  
  
  Her face was in decent shape, she thought, as she snatched a look in a mirror. It held the marks and creases of a woman who’d given birth multiple times and endured many political races. No human being could emerge unblemished after that. Whatever frailty you possessed the other side would find and stick a crowbar in to lever every useful scrap out. The press still referred to her as attractive. Some went out on a limb and described her as possessing movie-star good looks. Maybe once, she knew, but not anymore. She was definitely in the “character actress” stage of her career now. Still, she had progressed a long way from the days when firm cheekbones and a firmer backside were high on her list of priorities.  
  
  As the party continued, Jane would occasionally glance out the window as serious-looking Marines marched by on patrol, weapons at the ready. The Secret Service had of course traveled up here with her, but the Navy officially ran Camp David. Thus all personnel, from the carpenters to the groundskeepers, were sailors. And the bulk of the security duties fell to the permanent barracks of Marines deployed here. In truth, Camp David was better protected than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, though you wouldn’t find many who would admit that on the record.  
  
  Security wasn’t uppermost in Jane’s mind as she watched in delight while Willa blew out the dozen candles on her two-tier cake and then helped hand out slices. Jane moved forward and hugged Willa’s mother, Pam Dutton, who was tall and thin with curly red hair.  
  
  “She looks happy, doesn’t she?” said Jane to Pam.  
  
  “Always happy around her aunt Jane,” replied Pam, patting her sister-in-law’s back affectionately. As the two women stepped apart Pam said, “I can’t thank you enough for letting us have the party here. I know it’s not, well, it’s not the norm, what with Dan, I mean the president not even being here.”  
  
  Not being a blood relation, Pam still found it uncomfortable calling her brother-in-law by his first name, whereas the president’s siblings, and Jane herself, often called him Danny.  
  
  Jane smiled. “The law provides for joint ownership of all federal property between the president and the First Lady. And just so you know, I still balance our personal checkbook. Danny’s not that good with numbers.”  
  
  Pam said, “It was still very thoughtful.” She looked at her daughter. “Next year she’s a teenager. My oldest a teenager, hard to believe.”  
  
  Pam had three children. Willa, John, who was ten, and Colleen, seven. Jane also had three children, but all of them were older. The youngest was a nineteen-year-old son in college and her daughter was a nurse at a hospital in Atlanta. In between was another young man still trying to figure out what to do with his life.  
  
  The Coxes had had their family early. Jane was still only forty-eight while her husband had just celebrated his fiftieth.  
  
  Jane said, “Based on my own experience, boys will mess with your heart and girls with your head.”  
  
  “I’m not sure my head’s ready for Willa.”  
  
  “Keep the lines of communication open. Know who her friends are. Gently insert yourself into everything that’s going on around her but pick your battles cautiously. Sometimes she’ll pull back. That’s only natural, but once you’ve laid the ground rules it’ll be okay. She’s very intelligent. She’ll get it pretty quickly. She’ll be glad of the interest.”  
  
  “Sounds like good advice, Jane. I can always count on you.”  
  
  “I’m sorry Tuck couldn’t make it.”  
  
  “He’s supposed to be back tomorrow. You know your brother.”  
  
  She shot an anxious glance at Pam. “It’ll be okay. Trust me.”  
  
  “Sure, right,” the woman said quietly, her gaze on happy Willa.  
  
  As Pam walked off, Jane focused on Willa. The girl was a curious mix of maturity coupled with frequent flashes of the preteen she still was. She could write better than some adults and discourse on subjects that would befuddle many folks far her senior. And she possessed a curiosity about things that was not limited to issues common to her age group. Yet if one watched her, one would see that she giggled impulsively, used “like” and “wow” liberally, and was just starting to discover boys with impulses of both disgust and attraction typical of the preadolescent girl. That reaction to the opposite sex would not change much when Willa became an adult, Jane well knew. Except the stakes would be far higher.  
  
  The party ended, goodbyes said. Jane Cox stepped on board the chopper. It wasn’t designated as Marine One because the president wasn’t riding on it. Today, it was strictly ferrying the B-team, Jane knew. And that was perfectly fine with her. In private, she and her husband were equals. In public, she walked the obligatory two steps behind.  
  
  She strapped in and the door was swung shut and secured by a uniformed Marine. Four stoic Secret Service agents shared the ride with her. They lifted off and a few moments later she was staring down at Camp David, or the “Birdcage,” as the Secret Service had code-named the retreat, where it was cradled in the Catoctin Mountain Park. The chopper turned south and thirty minutes from now she would land safely on the lawn of the White House.  
  
  In her hand she held a note that Willa had given her before they’d left the party. It was a thank-you letter. She smiled. It was not unusual that Willa already had one prepared. The note was written in a mature voice and said all the right things. Indeed, some of Jane’s staff could have taken a page from her young niece’s etiquette handbook.  
  
  Jane folded the letter and put it away. The rest of the day and night would not be nearly as pleasant. Official duty called. The life of a First Lady, she had quickly learned, wa  
s one of a frenzied perpetual motion machine buffered often by bursts of tedium.  
  
  The chopper’s skids touched grass. Since the president wasn’t on board there was little fanfare as she made her way to the White House. Her husband was in his working office near the ceremonial oval one. She had made few demands on him when she’d agreed to stand by him in his run for the nation’s highest office. One of them was that she could enter his inner sanctum without announcement, without being on the official visitor’s list.  
  
  “I’m not a visitor,” she’d told him at the time. “I’m your wife.”  
  
  She approached the president’s “body man,” officially known as the Special Assistant to the President. He was at that moment looking through the peephole in the door to the Oval Office prior to going in and breaking up a meeting that was running behind. He was the person charged with keeping her husband on schedule and functioning at maximum efficiency. He did so by rising before dawn and devoting every moment of his waking life to whatever the man needed, often by anticipating these needs even before the president. In any place other than the White House, Jane thought, the “body man” would be simply called a wife.  
  
  “Get ’em out, Jay, because I’m coming in,” she told him. He moved with alacrity to do just this. He had never once “peeped” her. And never would if he wanted to keep his job.  
  
  She spent a few minutes with the president and told him about the birthday party, before going to their living quarters to freshen up and change her clothes for a reception she was hosting. As darkness fell a few hours later she returned to her “official” home, tugged off her shoes, and drank a much-needed cup of hot tea.  
  
  Twenty miles away, newly twelve-year-old Willa Dutton screamed.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  SEAN LOOKED at Michelle as they drove along. A brief look, a sizing-up glance. If she felt it, she didn’t comment. Her gaze stayed straight ahead.  
  
  “When’d you meet them?” she asked.  
  
  “When I was in protection. Kept in touch. Really nice family.”  
  
  “Okay,” she said absently, staring out the windshield.  
  
  “Have you seen Horatio lately?”  
  
  Michelle’s hand tightened around her cup of Starbucks coffee. “Why did you follow me down to his office?”  
  
  “Because I knew what you were going to do.”  
  
  “Which is what exactly?

Break in to try and find out what you told him when you were hypnotized.”  
  
  Michelle remained quiet.  
  
  “Did you find out?”  
  
  “It’s pretty late to be going over to someone’s house.”  
  
  “Michelle, I think we need to talk this—”  
  
  “What you need to do, Sean, is not go there.”  
  
  Sean stared out at a night that seemed to be closing in on him.  
  
  “You didn’t answer my question,” she said.  
  
  “You didn’t answer mine either,” he said in an annoyed tone.  
  
  “So about going over to their house this late?”  
  
  “It’s not my call.”  
  
  “I thought you were dropping off a birthday present?”  
  
  “I bought the present after she phoned. I suddenly remembered it was her birthday today.”  
  
  “Why then?”  
  
  “It might have to do with a job for us.”  
  
  “Your really nice family needs a private investigator?”  
  
  “And she didn’t want to wait.”  
  
  They turned off the winding country road and pulled into the long drive, passing trees on both sides.  
  
  “Boondocks,” muttered Michelle.  
  
  “Private,” Sean amended.  
  
  The next instant the large house came into view.  
  
  “Nice place,” she said. “Your friend obviously does well.”  
  
  “Government contracting. The Feds apparently throw money at people.”  
  
  “Wow, what a surprise. But the house is dark. You sure you got the time right?”  
  
  Sean eased the car to a stop in front.  
  
  Michelle put down her coffee and pulled out her pistol from its belt holster. “That was a woman’s scream.”  
  
  “Wait a minute. Don’t go off half-cocked,” he said, putting a restraining hand on her arm. The crashing sound from inside the house made him reach in the glove box for his own weapon. “Let’s confirm before calling the cops.”  
  
  “You hit the back, I got the front,” Michelle said.  
  
  He climbed out and hustled to the rear of the brick colonial skittering next to the side-load garage and stopping for a few moments to scan the terrain before heading on. After doing her own recon of the area, Michelle was next to the front door a minute later.  
  
  No more screams or crashes. No other vehicles in sight. She could call out, see if everything was okay. Only if it wasn’t she might be giving some bad guys a warning. She tried the front door. Locked. Something made her pull her hand back, she wasn’t quite sure what, only she was glad she had.  
  
  The bullet blast ripped through the door, sending shards of painted wood spinning into the air. She could actually feel the slugs race past before they riddled Sean’s car.  
  
  She leapt off the front porch and did a roll, coming up and hitting full sprint two steps later. Her hand dug into her pocket and her fingers drilled 911 on the keypad. The dispatcher’s voice came on. Michelle was about to speak when the garage door blew open and the pickup truck cut a tight turn and bore down on her. She turned, fired at the tires, then the windshield. Her phone flew out of her hand as she catapulted to the side and rolled down an embankment. She landed in a pile of leaves and mud at the bottom of a runoff ditch. She sat forward and looked up.  
  
  And fired.  
  
  Her aim, as usual, was unerring. The bullet hit the man dead in the chest. There was only one problem. Her jacketed 9mm round didn’t drop him. He staggered back, then brought his weapon up, took aim, and fired back.  
  
  The only thing that saved Michelle Maxwell that night was that she deduced her attacker was wearing body armor, and then was nimble enough to roll behind a monster oak before the MP5 rounds headed her way. Dozens of slugs slammed into the tree, shredding its bark and sending pieces of oak tailings whipsawing away. Yet wood that thick always won out, even over submachine gun bullets coming in waves.  
  
  She didn’t pause, because it only took a practiced hand seconds to eject and then slap in another clip on the MP. She jumped out, both hands on her pistol grip. This time she would aim for the head and drop him for good.  
  
  Only there was no one there for her to kill.  
  
  Mr. MP5 had pinned her down, then fled.  
  
  She cautiously made her way up the slope, her pistol pointed straight ahead. When she heard the truck start to race off she scrambled up, pulling at roots, branches, and vines. The pickup was out of sight by the time she reached the driveway. She hustled toward Sean’s car thinking she would take up pursuit, but stopped when she saw steam rising from under the hood. Her gaze drifted to the bullet holes in the sheet metal. They weren’t going anywhere.  
  
  They?  
  
  “Sean,” she screamed. “Sean!”  
  
  “In here!”  
  
  She sprinted up the steps, kicked open what was left of the shattered front door, and barreled into the living room, her gun making precise grid arcs.  
  
  Sean was kneeling on the floor, hovering over the woman. She was lying on her back. Arms and legs spread-eagled like she was frozen in a jumping jack. Her eyes were open but hard and flat because she was dead. The red hair touched her shoulders. It was easy to see what had killed the woman. Her throat had been shredded.  
  
  “Who is she?”  
  
  “Pam Dutton. The woman we were going to be meeting with.”  
  
  Michelle noticed the writing on the woman’s bare arms. “What’s that?”  
  
  “I’m not sure. It’s just a bunch of letters.” He leaned closer. “Looks like they used a black Sharpie.”  
  
  “Is anybody else in the house?”  
  
  “Let’s find out.”  
  
  “Can’t screw up the crime scene for the cops.”  
  
  He countered, “And we can’t let someone die who we could otherwise save.”  
  
  It only took a few minutes. There were four bedrooms on the top floor, two on each side of the hall set catty-cornered from one another. There was a young girl in the first bedroom they reached. She was unconscious but with no apparent injuries. Her breathing was steady and her pulse weak but steady.  
  
  “Colleen Dutton,” said Sean.  
  
  “Drugged?” Michelle said as she gazed down at the little girl.  
  
  Sean lifted the girl’s eyelid and noted the dilated pupil. “Looks to be.”  
  
  In the second bedroom lay a young boy in the same condition as the girl.  
  
  “John Dutton,” said Sean as he checked the child’s pulse and pupil. “Drugged too.”  
  
  The third bedroom was empty. The last bedroom was the largest. It wasn’t empty.  
  
  The man was on the floor. He had on pants, a T-shirt, and was barefoot. One side of his face was swollen and badly bruised.  
  
  “It’s Tuck Dutton, Pam’s husband.” Sean checked his pulse. “Knocked out but his breathing’s okay. Looks like he took quite a blow.”  
  
  “We really need to call the cops.” Michelle grabbed the phone off the nightstand. “Dead. They must’ve messed with the outside box.”  
  
  “Use your cell phone.”  
  
  “I lost it when they tried to run me down.”  
  
  “When who tried to run you down?”  
  
  “A driver and a guy with a submachine gun. Didn’t you see anybody when you came in?”  
  
  He shook his head. “I heard gunfire, then I came in the back door. Then another loud sound.”  
  
  “That was them crashing through the garage door. Looks like I had all the fun tonight.”  
  
  “Pam dead. Tuck knocked out. John and Colleen drugged.”  
  
  “You told me they had three kids.”  
  
  “They do. Willa’s apparently gone. Her bedroom was the empty one.”  
  
  “In the truck? Kidnapping?”  
  
  “Can’t be sure. What’d you see?”  
  
  “It was a Toyota Tundra, double cab, dark blue. Didn’t see the plates because I was busy trying not to die. Driver and a shooter. Both guys. Oh, and there’s at least one bullet hole in the windshield.”  
  
  “Did you see them well enough for an ID?”  
  
  “No, but one of them was wearing some serious body armor, like military l  
evel. Took a jacketed round from my Sig with no problem. And he was wearing a black ski mask, which made an ID problematic.”  
  
  “And no sign of a twelve-year-old girl in the truck?”  
  
  “Not that I saw. Probably drugged her too.”  
  
  Sean used his cell to call 911 and relay all the information. He slipped it back in his pocket and looked around.  
  
  “What’s that?”  
  
  Michelle strode across the room to check out the piece of luggage that was sticking out of the closet. “Garment bag, half open.” She bent lower. “It has a tag on it. United Airlines Flight 567 into Dulles with today’s date on it.” She used a washcloth snatched from the bathroom to cover her hand while she slid the zipper open a few inches and peered inside. “Men’s clothes. Must be Tuck’s.”  
  
  Sean looked down at the unconscious man’s bare feet and his T-shirt. “He gets home, probably sees Pam, heads up here to drop his bag, starts to change, and wham.”  
  
  “Something is bugging me. That Tundra that came out of the garage. Either it belongs to the Duttons or the bad guys drove their own vehicle in there.”  
  
  “They might have done it so no one would see them put Willa in it.”  
  
  “In the boondocks? At this hour? You can’t even see another house from here. I’m not even sure there is another house.”  
  
  “And why take Willa and not one of the other kids?”  
  
  “And why would they kill the mom and leave everyone else alive?”  
  
  Sean tried to rouse Tuck, but got no response.  
  
  “Better leave him alone. He might have some internal injuries.”  
  
  They walked back downstairs and then Sean veered toward the kitchen and through it into the garage. There were three garage doors. In one bay was a late-model Mercedes four-door sedan. In another bay was a Chrysler minivan. The third bay was empty.  
  
  Michelle pointed to the destroyed garage door. “Truck was parked in this space, obviously. Do you know if the Duttons owned a blue Tundra?”  
  
  “No. But the odds are it was theirs.”  
  
  “Because the bay is clear?”  
  
  “Right. Just about every garage is packed with all sorts of crap, sometimes even including a car. The fact that all the bays were clean meant they had three vehicles, otherwise the third bay would be used for storage.”  
  
  “Wow, you really are a detective.”  
  
  Sean put his hand on the hood of the Mercedes. “Warm.”  
  
  Michelle ran her finger over one of the car’s tires. “Tread’s wet. We had some rain this evening. Must be Tuck coming from the airport.”  
  
  They walked back to the living room and stared down at Pam Dutton. Sean used his elbow to flick on the light switch, pulled out his notepad, and copied down the letters on the woman’s arm.  
  
  Michelle bent lower and examined Pam’s hands. “Looks like she’s got some blood and skin under her nails. Most likely defensive trace.”  
  
  “Noticed that too. Hope they can trip something on a DNA database.”  
  
  Michelle said, “But shouldn’t there be more blood?”  
  
  Sean examined the body more closely. “You’re right. The rug should be covered. Looks like they severed her carotid. She would’ve bled out pretty fast.”  
  
  Michelle saw it first, the plastic piece protruding out from under the dead woman’s elbow. “Is that what I think it is?”  
  
  Sean nodded. “It’s an empty vial.” He glanced over at his partner. “Did they take her blood with them?”  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  TALBOT’S WAS HAVING A SALE. Diane Wohl had left work at four to take advantage. A new dress, a few blouses, maybe some slacks, a scarf. She’d just gotten a raise at work and wanted to put it to good use. There was nothing wrong with pampering yourself every once in a while. She parked her car in the shopping mall garage and walked about four hundred feet to the store. She left two hours later after trying on several outfits and buying two bags full of clothing, doing her patriotic duty to stimulate an otherwise lousy economy.  
  
  She hopped in the car after tossing her bags in the passenger seat. She was hungry and was thinking about picking up some Chinese take-out on the way home. She had just put the key in the ignition when she felt the small circle of metal against her head. A strong odor made her forget about kung pao chicken with all white meat and egg drop soup. It was a mixture of gun oil and cigarettes.  
  
  “Drive,” the voice said quietly but firmly. “Or you’re dead.”  
  
  She drove.  
  
  An hour later the suburbs had disappeared. The only thing visible was lined asphalt, a harvest moon, and walls of trees. Not another car, not another person. Diane Wohl was completely alone with whatever monster was sitting in the back of her Honda.  
  
  He spoke again. “Turn off here.”  
  
  Her gut tightened and stomach acid driven by fear heaved up her throat.  
  
  The car bumped along the dirt road for a few minutes. The mass of trees seemed to swallow up the car.  
  
  “Stop.”  
  
  Diane slid the gearshift lever to park. As she pulled her hand back the woman eyed her purse with a sideways glance. Her cell phone was in there. If she could somehow turn it on. Or her keys. She had a big wad of them. She could pull them; gouge him in the eyes like she’d seen on TV shows. Only she was so terrified she couldn’t. Her entire body was trembling like she had Parkinson’s.  
  
  The monster of few words said, “Out.”  
  
  She didn’t move. Her throat was crusted dry but she managed to say, “If you want my car and my money you can have them. Just please don’t hurt me. Please.”  
  
  The monster was not persuaded. “Out.” He wedged the gun muzzle against the back of her head. A piece of her hair caught against the bump of the gunsight and was pulled out root and all. Tears trickled down the woman’s cheeks as she confronted the last few minutes of her life. It was like all the warnings had said:  
  
  Know your surroundings. Be alert. It only takes a second.  
  
  From Talbot’s to death on a lonely strip of dirt.  
  
  She opened the car door and started to slide out, her hand clutching her purse. She gasped and let go when the gloved fingers closed around her wrist.  
  
  “You won’t need that.”  
  
  She closed the door behind her.  
  
  Her hopes sank when he joined her outside the car. She had been praying that he would merely climb over the front seat and take her Honda, instead of stealing her life.  
  
  He was older, with thick, longish white hair that looked sweaty and dirty. And his face appeared carved from solid rock with rivulets running all over the surface. He was older, but he was also a big, tall man, well over two hundred pounds with broad shoulders and huge, veined hands. He towered over the petite Wohl. Even without the weapon she had no chance against him. His gun was pointed right at her head. The fact that he wasn’t wearing a mask terrified her; she could clearly see his face.  
  
  He doesn’t care. Doesn’t care if I know who he is. He’s going to kill me. Rape and then kill me. And leave me out here. She started to sob.  
  
  “Please don’t do this,” she said as he took a step forward and she took a step back, bracing for the attack.  
  
  She never noticed the other man come up behind her. When he touched her shoulder, she shrieked and turned. He was smaller and wiry, his Hispanic features clearly defined. Yet she never saw this because he held up the canister and the dense mist hit her squarely in the face.  
  
  Choking, Diane took a deep breath to clear her lungs. It didn’t work; her senses quickly leaving her, she slumped in his arms. They put her in the back of a rental van parked nearby and drove off.

 Chapter 1 Warning Message


Three minutes from now, the people around you will turn into zombies.

Upon receiving the text message, Maura Moore's initial reaction was one of disbelief. It was a recent popular internet joke, a script played out by many bloggers who wrote about the apocalypse. Without missing a beat, she replied: Is that you, Jana? Or is it Yvett? Are you messing with me? It's not April Fool's Day today.

No sooner had she sent the message than the lights overhead flickered, causing her heart to leap in her chest.

Rita Lupton, a colleague sitting nearby, couldn't help but look up. “Hmm, that's odd. When was the last time we had a power outage in Kheawood? What's going on?”

Maura was a twenty-two-year-old intern at an internet company, where working overtime was the norm. It was six in the evening, and, being early winter, darkness had already fully descended. It seemed as though rain was on the horizon, with the branches outside the window swaying faintly in the gloom.

Like the shadowy beasts of the dark fairy tales, baring their fangs and claws, ready to drag people into the abyss.

Maura had always considered herself brave, but when Rita from the neighboring workstation turned to look at her, Maura couldn't help but feel a jolt of fear. Rita's face was pale, and her eyes were rigid, a sight that was truly unnerving. Maura's gaze drifted downward, only to find that the edges of Rita's nails were also turning a ghastly shade of blue.

Rita seemed to find Maura's daydreaming rather odd, moving closer with a hint of concern. “Maura, what's got you so distracted? Be careful, or the director might scold you again.”

The overpowering stench of decay nearly made Maura retch, causing her to abruptly stand up.

The other colleagues in the office also looked up. Everyone was unsure of what was wrong with her.

Maura was noticeably nervous as she swallowed hard, starting to gather her things in preparation to leave. “I'm not feeling well, so I'll head home first. Rita, could you please inform the director about my absence for me?”

After she finished speaking, she quickly grabbed her bag and headed toward the door. She indeed looked a bit off-color.

Rita, who was behind her, seemed utterly confused, wondering aloud, “Why did you suddenly feel unwell out of nowhere? Young people these days are just too pampered. I got bitten by a dog yesterday, got a rabies shot, and yet here I am, still at work. You better watch out. The director might get angry and fire you!”

Upon hearing the final sentence, Maura had already reached the office door. “So be it! I quit!”

Her heart was pounding heavily.

After leaving the office, she glanced at her phone messages. Two minutes had already passed since she received the text. Thankfully, the company wasn't located on a high floor; it was situated on the third floor. After a moment of contemplation, she quickly descended the stairs.

One should never take the elevator when the electrical circuit was unstable. If one ended up trapped inside, it would be disastrous.

She would be a sitting duck.

Maura practically sprinted down the stairs. Just as she reached the bottom of the company building, a piercing scream echoed from above. The passersby around her couldn't help but gasp in shock, their gazes collectively drawn upward.

“Damn, that scared the crap out of me!”

“What's going on? Don't tell me the work stress is getting too much, and someone is thinking of jumping off a building again?”

“Yikes, that was terrifying. Let's get out of here, quick!”

...

Upon hearing the scream, Maura's hands started shaking. She glanced at her phone. Precisely three minutes had passed. She didn't dare to lift her head as she quickly swiped her card and left the technology park.

Once she left the office area, she immediately scanned the code to rent a bike and hurried home, not daring to linger any longer.

She no longer dared to take public transportation.

She hadn't received any new messages, and the cellphone tower signal was sporadically disappearing.

She wanted to send messages to her friends, warning them of the impending danger. But when not a single one could be sent, she knew the world was truly in trouble.

At this point, a storm was brewing.

She rode her bike at a high speed. Thankfully, everyone she passed by behaved normally.

Twenty minutes later, she successfully arrived at the residential area, which somewhat put Maura at ease. She didn't waste any time, and before heading up to her apartment, she stepped into the largest supermarket at the entrance of the residential area. Casually pulling a shopping cart, she began her major shopping spree.

Milk, bread, instant pasta, chocolate, along with a variety of beverages that were high in sweetness and calories.

At that moment, she was largely disoriented, her nerves taut with tension. Her actions were entirely driven by subconscious decisions, guided by her instinct to survive.

After she filled up an entire cart, the stock clerk, Hazel, suddenly expressed her concern, “Young lady, what happened? You don't seem to be in a good state! Are you upset? Why didn't you work overtime today?”

Maura often came to shop after work in the evenings, so the supermarket staff were quite familiar with her.

“Ah, well, I was feeling down, so I decided to have a big meal,” she said.

It seemed as though Maura had just awoken from a daze. She managed a strained smile as she asked Hazel, “By the way, don't you offer delivery service here? Could you help me deliver ten boxes of mineral water? Just drop them off at the eighth floor of Building A. Leaving them in the elevator would be fine.”

Upon hearing the request, Hazel readily agreed, but couldn't help expressing her curiosity, “Why would a young woman like you buy so much bottled water? It would probably take you ages to finish them!”

Maura was stuffing all sorts of canned food into her shopping cart. As she did so, she replied, “I can't be bothered to shop all the time. I got fired from my job today, so starting from tomorrow, I'll be busy looking for work. I won't have time to come back for groceries.”

Upon hearing this, Hazel immediately sighed. “Young people these days are under such tremendous pressure. All right, I'll prepare your bill in a bit, then you can come over to pay. How can a young lady like you constantly consume such junk food? Even if you're in a bad mood, you can't just binge eat and drink like this. It's really harmful to your stomach, you know?”

Upon hearing these caring words, Maura's heart ached. She had been adopted and brought home by an elderly couple. After they passed away and their house was demolished, she had moved here less than a year ago. To be cared for so deeply by a stranger all of a sudden was truly heart-wrenching.

She opened her mouth again and again, but still couldn't bring herself to tell Hazel about the zombie incident.

After all, she didn't have enough evidence to prove that the end of the world and zombies were actually coming.

So, she silently followed Hazel to pay for her items. The kind lady even helped her carefully pack her purchases and accompanied her all the way to the elevator.

Maura hauled up the emergency supplies and ten boxes of bottled water that she had purchased. As the elevator doors closed, she could still hear the security guard casually chatting with Hazel.

“Oh, Hazel. Here delivering goods again? How come this young lady bought so much?”

“The poor woman is in a bad mood after being fired from her job. Says she needs to start job hunting from tomorrow and can't be bothered to keep purchasing bottled water all the time. Young people these days tend to cope with stress by shopping excessively, unlike us older folks who've lived through tougher times, right?”

“Hahaha, that's true.”

After that, Maura couldn't hear anything else. Having reached the eighth floor, she quickly moved her stuff out, then shut the elevator doors before moving everything back to her house. It was only upon returning to this familiar place that she felt somewhat at ease.

She collapsed onto the couch. The overhead light was glaring down at her, so all she could do was close her eyes and attempt to regain her composure, catching her breath in the process. She intended to sort through the pile of supplies by the door later, but something felt off as soon as she closed her eyes.

It was as if she were suddenly experiencing an illusion. With her eyes closed, she could see a Rubik's Cube. However, this was no ordinary cube; it was multifaceted, with countless sides densely packed together.

It was whirling at high speed.

Maura abruptly started retching, completely disoriented by the rapid spinning.


Chapter 2 The Multifaceted Space


She was no stranger to the internet, often interacting with it, and was familiar with online novels. The term “apocalypse” was often associated with the concept of storage space. Thus, through her experimentation, she discovered that this cube was indeed a dimensional storage! This discovery left her with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow.

The joy was in gaining a massive storage space, but the sorrow lay in the realization that the world was truly out of sorts.

Once she regained her senses, the Rubik's Cube ceased to spin, as if its initial spinning was merely a startup ritual.

The dimensional storage cube was now still in the sea of her consciousness, all peaceful and quiet.

After a while, Maura finally managed to regain her composure.

No longer feeling dizzy, she rose and moved toward the window, her gaze falling on the people strolling below. Unaware of what the future held, they carried on as they would on any ordinary day.

Some people were in a rush just after finishing work, while others were out for a stroll with their families after dinner.

Every now and then, delivery drivers would bustle back and forth.

The streetlights bathed everything in a soft halo, casting an aura of extreme bliss. It was an utterly ordinary evening, leaving her to wonder if such moments could ever be witnessed again in the future.

She had been on edge for quite some time. Subsequently, she drew the curtains and swiftly stowed away all the supplies at the door into the storage space. Indeed, it was very convenient.

Turning around, she opened the door on the right side of the entrance. It was a storage room. Inside were three massive shelves and a large freezer.

Thanks to the outbreak of the epidemic, during the lockdown in the neighborhood, there was a scarcity of food and drink.

Maura was quite the survival enthusiast, and as such, she had a penchant for stockpiling food. After the epidemic ended, her desire to hoard only grew stronger.

That was why she had such a well-stocked pantry, filled with canned goods that had a shelf life of up to ten years. There were a total of twenty boxes, each filled with various types of canned food.

There was a mix of both meat and vegetables.

In addition to ten boxes of assorted flavored compressed biscuits and ten boxes of high-calorie energy bars, there were also five huge bags of pasta. A variety of instant foods and self-heating meals were also available. Even mineral water was well-stocked, with ten boxes at the ready.

As for perishable items like milk and vegetables, she would occasionally replenish them in her usual routine.

There was still quite a lot left in the large kitchen refrigerator.

The storage room held a variety of condiments as well. Among them, there were three boxes of salt, with the rest divided into several portions for each type, such as ketchup, mustard, vinegar, and so on.

Besides that, she also had survival supplies such as a backpack filled with everything a hardcore survivalist could dream of. It contained numerous handy tools, as well as enough food for one person.

Outside the backpack, there was a chainsaw, a hatchet, and a dagger.

She even had three containers of gasoline.

Primarily, they would be used for generating electricity. In case of a power outage, she also had a domestic generator at her disposal.

Of course, there were also several large boxes of medical supplies. These included items for stopping bleeding, reducing inflammation, relieving pain, and bandaging wounds. There were both oral and topical medications, as well as vitamins.

These were all things Maura typically kept around for her own amusement. However, looking at this storage room now, she couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions. She truly never thought they would come in handy.

She swiftly stashed all these items into the dimensional storage cube, feeling the connection between her and this space. The reason she could confidently store all her supplies in this space was largely due to this sensation.

There was a sensation of a blood-tied connection. At least when she was still alive, everything would be there, and only she alone could take or put things in.

It gave a strong sense of security.

After emptying the entire storage room, she moved on to the bathroom. There was a large tub in the bathroom that was kept filled with water year-round. After some experimentation, she found that she could store the water directly into one of the spaces on another facet of the cube without needing a container. So she turned on the faucet, planning to transfer the water from the tub into the space periodically.

She planned to fill one of the compartments with water. She estimated that each compartment was roughly 200 cubic meters. This multi-faceted space, reminiscent of a Rubik's Cube, seemed to have countless sides.

She couldn't even keep count!

Maura suddenly felt a lot more at ease. After that, she chose not to venture downstairs to gather more supplies, as the night was always more perilous than the day.

She decided to first observe the changes quietly.

Hence, she decided to have dinner and headed to the kitchen. Despite working at an internet company, she was fortunate enough to have alternating weekends off. Therefore, she would prepare some ready-made meals for herself on weekends and store them in the freezer. When it was time to eat, like now, all she had to do was heat it up in the microwave for three minutes.

And so, a steaming hot plate of pasta bolognese was ready. Maura had also washed a small bowl of fruit, filled with large, eye-protecting blueberries.

In the end, she carried her meal to the coffee table in the living room to enjoy, casually switching on the television as she did. Despite the popularity of projectors among the younger crowd, she maintained a preference for the television. It held a nostalgic charm for her, evoking memories of watching shows with her elderly adoptive parents, a sentiment that brought her comfort.

Upon turning on the television, it was the local news channel that the three of them used to frequently watch.

“Welcome to the latest daily news. This is your reporter, Wendy, bringing you the updates. According to submissions from local residents, a harrowing incident occurred at Hypernet Corporation, located on the third floor of Building B in the technology park's Phase Two. The individual involved was a young woman who was bitten by her colleague, a certain Ms. Lupton. Unfortunately, despite Ms. Lupton having received a rabies vaccination just the previous night, the onset of the disease was alarmingly swift.”

After switching on the television, Maura took a bite of her meal, only to be taken aback by what she heard. She abruptly looked up to see the female reporter in the video, her face filled with regret as she announced the news. Following that, she brought up the issue of having dogs on leashes during walks.

The highlight of this news program was always the latest daily scoop. It provided updates on all the recent happenings within the city each day.

Hence, an event that occurred just after six in the evening could still be promptly reported in the news.

As the reporter provided commentary, a clip from an incident in the office was shown in the top left corner. From the perspective of the person filming, when Rita initially went berserk and bit Alice, the filming colleague, Brynn, was still joking around, saying, “Oh no, Rita's gone mad from working overtime! Hahaha!”

However, Alice then screamed out loud because Rita had bitten her hard enough to draw blood, even tearing a chunk of flesh from her. This horrifying scene caused Brynn, who was filming, to shriek in fear as well. The video that followed was nothing but shaky footage of a frantic escape, filled with blurry images. The mood among the spectators shifted from curiosity to panic.

“Many netizens claim this was a case of a zombie biting someone, but that's actually a rumor. The truth was, Ms. Lupton simply had unusually sharp teeth, which resulted in the person being bitten to the point of severe injury. In order to prevent public panic, everyone is urged not to heedlessly believe in rumors.”

After the reporter finished their final statement, the host took over with a smile and started delivering the closing remarks.

Maura couldn't even eat her meal, her appetite lost after what she had heard. She cast her phone screen onto the television and tried to open the trending page on Twitter. As expected, the incident at her company was indeed the hot topic.

#KheawoodZombie

#EndOfTheWorld

She connected to her home's internet, attempting to refresh the signal several times before it improved slightly.

Meanwhile, as if there was a delay, she suddenly received a barrage of messages.

There were some from Carrie, another of her colleagues.

Carrie: Damn, you sure are blessed with good luck, Maura! The moment you left, Rita went ballistic!

Carrie: Wait, no, it's not that. She just had a rabies episode.

Carrie: Good thing you left quickly!

Carrie had joined the company around the same time as Maura did, with just a day's difference.

Thus, their relationship was decent.

Maura was in no mood to respond to her. She couldn't eat her meal and was breaking out in a cold sweat. It had been a close call, so very close. Had she not left when she did, she would have been the one bitten, as she was the closest to Rita.",1,1755798076.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mwhs41,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mwhs41/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_bunn/,Evaluate the best single serve coffee maker BUNN MCU worth it,"BUNN 42900.0501 MCU Coffee Brewer had me surprisingly intrigued. Coffee makers are a dime a dozen, but this one stood out because of its oddly versatile nature. Who knew I'd grow to appreciate something that essentially lets you brew almost anything short of an entire meal but stays reliable enough for daily use? If you're considering a coffee maker that hosts several brewing methods, this might sit right at home on your countertop.

**A Compact But Clever Design**  
The first thing that struck me was its subtle yet functional design. Compact dimensions of 10.1""D x 7.2""W x 12.1""H mean it doesn’t dominate counter space — a blessing for someone juggling a crowded kitchen. The blend of black and stainless steel finish adds a modern flair, but don’t expect it to scream high-end. It’s sturdy enough to handle daily wear and tear, with a decent feel that suggests it’s built to survive more than just a year or two. Plus, everything you need is thoughtfully laid out, including dedicated drawers for K-Cups, ground coffee, tea bags, or loose tea. Organization enthusiasts, rejoice!

**Ease of Use Meets Multifunctionality**  
After spending weeks brewing everything from ground coffee to herbal tea and even utilizing the hot water drawer for oatmeal, the convenience is undeniable. It operates via simple buttons, making it accessible without needing to read a manual like you're programming a spaceship. The water level indicator in the pour-in bowl eliminates messy guesswork, a win when you’re rushing through a groggy morning. One of my favorite features has to be the pulse brew button, which extends the brew time for bolder flavors. As someone who leans toward robust cups of coffee, this function is a game-changer.  

[Check BUNN 42900.0501 MCU Coffee Brewer details on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b08v96t69c/)

**Don’t Just Brew Coffee**  
You don’t see a coffee maker often touted as compatible with K-Cups, ground coffee, soft pods, tea bags, and even loose tea. The BUNN model delves into this territory with ease. One afternoon, I entertained guests with a mix of chai lattes (using tea bags) and bold espressos — needless to say, the variety made me the unsung hero of the gathering. Its internal stainless steel hot water tank keeps the water at the optimal temperature for flavor extraction, which, if you ask me, is the real MVP of this brewer.

**Perks**  
- Almost ridiculously versatile: you can brew coffee grounds, K-Cups, tea bags, or loose tea.  
- The compact design fits smaller kitchen spaces without looking clunky.  
- Pulse brew technology works beautifully for a stronger cup.  
- Cleaning is straightforward thanks to its removable drawers and parts.  

**Shortcomings**  
- No built-in reservoir which means pouring water for every single brew (forget multitasking).  
- Noise levels exceed expectations when in operation; don’t brew if your baby is napping nearby.  
- Missing advanced programming options like timers – feels like a basic tradeoff.  

**Product Rivals**  
The BUNN MCU faces stiff competition from heavyweights in the fancy single-serve coffee maker world. Take Keurig machines, for example. They boast intuitive touchscreens and huge water reservoirs but lack the versatility of brewing loose tea or soft pods. Nespresso brewers, while hyped for espressos, are limited in flavor diversity and don’t dabble much in tea. Then there’s Hamilton Beach’s FlexBrew series, offering dual brewing but feeling clunkier and less streamlined by comparison. Where the BUNN surprisingly shines is its no-nonsense, multi-functional charm.

**Smart Spending**  
Priced somewhere mid-range for coffee makers, this brewer offers decent bang for your buck. With the added ability to brew multiple beverage types, it skirts past the feeling of a one-trick pony, unlike products solely locked into pod systems. Unless someone solely craves luxury features, I'd genuinely say it offers solid cost efficiency for practical users.

1mwhqyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mwhqyq/i_despise_my_parents_secretly_wish_death_on_them/,I despise my parents & secretly wish death on them,"I 25F feel like my parents failed me on a foundational level. I think my mom just wanted a mixed kid to have around like a toy, and my dad just wanted a citizenship. I have not been taught the language that they both speak nor have I really learned about my cultural identity & it is such a lonely experience that weighs on me every day, but that’s just the start of why I hate them. 

They’re both extremely selfish people. My dads selfishness looked like never showing up & my moms comes through being a controlling sad sack. 

I’ve always felt like nothing is ever about me with them unless I make a mistake, then it’s all about me and everyone on the planet will be told about my fuck ups. My dad hasn’t wished me a happy birthday since I was 10. Any time I’m supposed to be celebrated my mom is either a Debbie downer or she picks a fight with me over something stupid. Neither of them showed up to my college graduation a couple months ago and I’m really hurt by that. (Put a pin in that)

My mom has been experiencing chronic pain over the past couple years and it has only made things worse between us. She expects me to be her care taker, I told her I didn’t want to do that, she said “you’re my daughter, you’ll do it because I said so” ( her family has money so she really doesn’t need me to take care of her) she is always talking about how acts of service means so much to her & im the same but she never does any for me. I asked her if she could help me put a keychain on my purse because I had my nails done & she said she was in too much pain, there’s no way she could possibly do that. If she is out at a coffee shop & I ask if she could bring me some coffee, her back would hurt too much.  When it comes to my college graduation she told me she was going to come, that she had to work to tolerate the 90 min drive as she has to alternate sitting & standing. The day before my graduation she lets me know she’s not coming because her knee hurts, but she can get in the car to go see a man 2 hours away just fine. 

My mom threatens to kill herself a lot. She always says that I’m the only reason she hasn’t blown her brains out. It got to the point where I started to have panic attacks when she wouldn’t text me back or answer the phone because I was worried I was gonna get a call
 that someone would find her body or that I would find it. My therapist urged me to tell her to stop putting that on me and when I told her she laughed and said “I’m your mother, you will support me. I’m not going to kill myself yet.” She’ll also threaten suicide as a way to control me. It could be any reason from me not taking the trash out right when she asks me to, or if I start dating and I don’t make her the center of my universe. I recently went on a trip with the man I’ve been seeing and my mom kept trying to talk me out of it by saying she was suicidal. (Mind you, this is as this man is outside of my house waiting to pick me up) then when I threaten to call the cops on her, she switched gears and said “are you sure he’s not going to drive off anyways once he sees all the weight you’ve gained?” I’ve always been a big girl but I’ve always been attractive, and my mom has always been jealous of that. She looks at me and sees my dad and it disgusts her. She also treats me like a man and I hate her guts for that too.

Recently, I made the stupid ass decision to move in with my mom post graduation as I was promised that there would be no charging rent. 
Now whenever we have a disagreement, she tells me I have to pay rent or she’ll “throw me out on the street to die.” To add onto that, my car recently died on me. When it happened my
Mom was saying we would be sharing her car & she would be flexible. Mind you, it hasn’t been  week, I haven’t even borrowed her car yet, and now she’s saying that I can’t use her car unless I download life360 and give her a pre-approved location before hand. I will not be doing that. 

Things with my mom have gotten so bad I felt desperate enough to reach out to my dad for some support like a stupid bitch. We were supposed to meet today & he didn’t show up. I just feel devastated and I wish I had immediate family that gave a fuck about me. I don’t understand. If being a parent was a life goal, then they both failed. So why are they even alive!

Context : I (25F), and my bf (27M) go out together and I've never been happier with someone before, we'd either sleep at my place (or more like my mother's house) or my bf's dad's house.

At the start of our relationship, my bf told me his father would like him to stay with him while he finishes his work contract and get retired, we thought it's not a bad idea, plus he'll feel less lonely since my bf is his only kid left living with him (my bf has a sister and brother who both have their own places)

So I get to his place, we already saw each other beforehand from time to time but ""a few nights there"" became ""living at his place"" but no biggie for the both of us, since we get to talk, I get to help him with chores and all.

Or so I thought because he never told me anything, but at first he complained that I wasn't doing too much at home (just a few brooming here and there), that my sister in law had to tell me about it because my father in law wouldn't communicate but instead make out of context snarky remarks. But no big deal, I was wondering why he was being mean for the past few weeks before she told me and changed that, making more chores, cleaning more and trying to help more around the house, naturally cuz I live there now.

It went better for the next few months, we got to talk normally again without mean comments or anything else.

EXCEPT,

That now he became mean again for no reason, I do chores, I help around the house, I buy stuffs when there's low stock like sugar, coffee, throw trash away. He complains about making dinner everynight, I wish I could help him on that point but me and my bf always finish work at 5pm if not later.
His comments are meaner than before, I don't know why, but I'm also too tired to try and fight it, it just gets to my feelings and self esteem. Yesterday and today I bawled my eyes out in our bedroom because of that, my boyfriend doesn't really understand why I'm reacting that way, but I know he's worried for me.

I know I'm not as talkative as his daughter or daughter in law, because I'm too shy and I fear my interests aren't the same as him (I'm more of a nerdy / pc person and he's kinda an old Chinese man, with old values and kinda anti-tech), but I swear I try my best to listen to him and talk to him when we used to.

But when I try nowadays I'm like, hitting a wall at high speed, ""[daughter in law's name] stayed a bit at work before taking her day off so [coworker] won't be drowning in work""(for context me and my sister in law both work at the same company) and then he just made a comment like ""it's so YOU won't be drowning in work, be for real and don't fucking lie !"" Something like that, this really wounded me because we don't even have the same work ?? It's just an example, but it's what I get constantly hit with.

I just can't do it anymore, I love him but I hate how he clearly plays favorites with his son and daughter in law, even though I try my best.

1mwhkcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1mwhkcl/sometimes_i_feel_like_a_lot_of_people/,Sometimes I feel like a lot of people misunderstand what a polycule is,"Maybe Im just a hater. Maybe it’s the subculture in my city.

But I see a lot of my fellow queer poly community; especially the people newer to poly. And more importantly, new to having a loving community. Just running into it.

I constantly hear the same story about how someone tried to force a throuple/quad or other similar group poly dynamic.  Only to later hear them talk about how it didn’t work out. Maybe someone felt left out/unloved. Maybe they just felt overwhelmed. Whatever.

And yes. Polyamory can and will often involve overlap. That means two our your best friends might be dating. Your best friend and your nesting partner may have a romantic dynamic. Two of your partners may date. But I see so many rush to the finish line because they are convinced that is what POLY IS.

There’s a lot of “my partner is hot. Her girlfriend is hot. We should keep having threesomes”. We should all just hang as a group anyway since we all like each other. What’s the point of one on one hangs with anyone? 

And it’s like… the reason poly works isn’t cause everyone likes everyone. It’s cause there’s boundaries. Or more importantly? Every relationship is given space to be its own thing.

So while I might love multiple partners and maybe they date each other too. Im still gonna date you one on one and talk to you one on one. We may have group hangs, a DnD campaign, all hangout for birthdays. Whatever.

When you have multiple relationships merging into one, you aren’t creating a fun modern healthy polycule where everyone loves everyone. You’re creating a clusterfuck. Because like it or not, it’s precarious. Any friction between two people or a falling out will completely change your group dynamics. And if all you have is a group dynamic. And if your partners are constantly telling you every detail about their life together. You aren’t creating space.  You aren’t creating space for life outside of that circle. And that is something I find deeply unhealthy.

Im not saying there shouldn’t be overlap. Or people shouldn’t like or know their partner. But  poly working is not a function of overlap. It’s a function of letting every relationship being their own thing.

If every time I was on a phone call with my partner; she just told me how much she loved my friend or how good their sex is or how they … in bed. I’d feel annoyed.

A polycule is allowed to look like “I love my partner. Her boyfriend seems great. Ive barely hung out with him much though.” Or even “I love my girlfriend’s wife. We get coffee together sometimes and I hang out with both of them if I stay for breakfast.” It doesn’t have to be a bohemian thing where everyone fucks or dates everyone.

And even if at some point your partners start dating or hooking up. That’s fine. But it’s not something that needs rushing into “cause we are all poly. We are all hot lesbians. Why not?”

And your polycule doesn’t need to be your only social circle where everyone dates everyone in the same space neither.",13,1755797482.0,polyamory,4,0.88,False

Clothes mixed with finance and accounting books, and somewhere in the chaos are his Air Jordan sneakers.

""I just want to take the clothes that I need,"" Kangethe says. ""I don't know, it's just too much.""

Too much trying to pack 16 years of his life into a handful of suitcases, and deciding what to pack, and what to leave behind.

Kangethe is leaving the U.S., the country where he earned graduate degrees through a student visa, where he worked as an accountant for a beer distribution company and for the State of Michigan, where he fell in love with his wife Latavia and where he became a dad of three: 13-year-old Dwight, 11-year-old Hailey, and 5-year-old Ella.

""For me it has been an absolute privilege to be in this country, like (an) absolute privilege,"" Kangethe says.

But Kangethe has decided to go back to his home country of Kenya because he's afraid of being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and being sent to an immigration detention center in some other state or even a prison overseas.

He has no criminal record in the U.S., and says he has committed no crimes. But he nonetheless faces removal proceedings after an immigration official ruled his previous marriage fraudulent in 2014. Kangethe says he presented evidence to fight the claims.

But that court case was pushed back during the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually dropped from the immigration court docket. His new court hearing was set for January 2026. But, because an immigration judge has not ruled on his case, Kangethe has been left in a legal limbo and is considered deportable.

NPR first reported on Kangethe's case last month, and is documenting his journey as he returns home.

""Deportation is the worst thing that would come out of this case,"" Kangethe says. ""How about if I take myself out as a show of good faith?""

The 'safest' option

Kangethe moves slowly around the house, as he sips coffee he brewed earlier.

He jokes he's still ""recovering"" from his wife's surprise farewell party. Dozens of friends showed up, and the confetti scattered across his backyard tells the story.

""She got me super emotional because you don't think of this stuff until something happens to you,"" Kangethe says, adding that the event showed him ""who can step up for me or who have you influenced or how far have you touched peoples' lives.""

He wishes he didn't have to leave the U.S.

But he sees it as a way to show he's taking accountability for his situation.

""This is the safest option that I had on the table for me,"" Kangethe says. ""So you can imagine, this is the safest but also it's the decision that is probably going to hurt me the most. It's hurting me and I feel that it's because of me that the kids are going to be hurting, too.""

He worries how his family will manage without him. They'll now have one income to get by on. They're partly relying on a fundraiser set up by friends on GoFundMe to help pay the mortgage as well as groceries and school-related expenses.

He says U.S. deportation policies create the very problem they're meant to solve —forcing families left behind in the U.S. into government dependency.

""You deport this guy, it's fine, it's just one person who left but then, what did he leave behind that we have to take care of as a country,"" Kangethe says. ""You are taking me, and now you are taking my responsibilities.""

An uncertain new life 

The next day, Kanhethe arrives at the Detroit Metro Airport in a red pickup truck. A group of friends have come with him to help him carry all of his bags and send him off.

Lawrence Hiti, a friend from Kenya who also lives in Lansing, joined Kangethe at the airport.

""It's sad because he's a long (time) friend, but you have to accept it,"" Hiti says while taking photos with his phone of Kangethe at the airport's curbside. ""It's his decision — I think he made the best decision for himself.""

Kangethe says his family stayed back home — it was too hard on them.

""The reason they didn't come to the airport with me it's because it was ugly. It was ugly leaving the house,"" Kangethe says. ""I felt like I had to run from them because there weren't enough 'byes', there weren't enough hugs.""


Samuel Kangethe packs 16 years of his life in a handful of suitcases on August 16, 2025. His family seats in the living room of their home in Lansing, Mich., watching him pack.
Sergio Martínez-Beltrán/NPR
His 5-year-old daughter Ella begged him to stay.

His sister Elizabeth flew in from Kenya to help him pack and navigate the journey back home.

She says she has mixed feelings — sad about him leaving his family, but also looking forward to showing him around the country he's been away from for nearly two decades. 

""It was a bit heartbreaking when we were saying the goodbyes and everything, the kids were all heartbroken,"" Elizabeth says. ""So I would really, really hope that he managed to come back and see them.""

That won't be easy. Kangethe has no idea when-or if-he can return. He might face a 10-year ban. His case hangs in limbo without a judge's decision.

But his sister says she hopes in the meantime that Kangethe is able to adapt to Kenyan culture, since he's lived in the U.S. for so long.

""I'm really praying that he will be able to come and absorb everything and adapt into the new environment because things are totally different,"" Elizabeth says. ""But I'm here to guide him.""

Kangethe is ready.

As he walks to the airport gate he makes one last video call with his loved ones.

I joined a maker space near my university but unfortunately, while staining my first project, I was sexually harassed by someone that worked in the building the maker space was in. I quit the maker space and stopped woodworking for the rest of the semester. This summer, I had a job near where I grew up and joined a different maker space in a different city and again felt so fulfilled and happy! Just yesterday I finished building a coffee table and am so proud of it! I leave this weekend to go back to school and I want to continue woodworking in my apartment.

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1755797309.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

\
by Emmitt Barry, with reporting from Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\
\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump said Thursday that Ukraine would have to continue attacking targets inside Russia if it hoped to win the war, even as Moscow unleashed a massive new bombardment on Ukrainian cities, including a strike that destroyed an American-owned electronics plant.\
\
""It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.""\
\
Trump also blamed former President Joe Biden for Russia's 2022 invasion, accusing him of not allowing Ukraine to strike Russian soil with U.S. weapons. The Biden administration had eventually permitted limited strikes inside Russia but only after months of hesitation over escalation risks.\
\
In his post, Trump shared two images: one of himself pointing at Russian President Vladimir Putin, superimposed over a historic photo of President Richard Nixon poking Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in the chest.\
\
Shift in Trump's Position\
\
As president-elect, Trump sharply criticized Biden for authorizing strikes inside Russia, calling it ""stupid"" and ""a big mistake."" In a December interview with Time magazine, he said:\
\
""I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We're just escalating this war and making it worse.""\
\
Now, his latest comments suggest a willingness to apply greater military pressure on Moscow, even while pursuing a negotiated settlement. Trump met with Putin in Alaska last week and then with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, saying both leaders had agreed to direct peace talks. But in recent days, senior Russian officials have backed away, insisting that lower-level agreements must come first.\
\
Russian Strike on U.S. Factory\
\
Hours after Trump's post, Russia carried out one of its largest airstrikes in months, targeting cities across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Among the sites hit was a Flex Ltd. electronics plant in Mukachevo, western Ukraine, where some 800 workers were on the night shift.\
\
The factory was struck by two Kalibr cruise missiles around 4:30 a.m., igniting a massive fire, Ukrainian officials said. At least 15 people were injured.\
\
""This was an ordinary civilian facility with American investment,"" Zelensky said, condemning the attack. ""They produced everyday household items, such as coffee machines.""\
\
Ukraine's foreign minister Andriy Sybiha noted that the plant had ""no connection to defense or the military,"" calling it a blatant strike on civilian industry.\
\
Flex Ltd., a Singaporean-American multinational with headquarters in Austin, Texas, and Singapore, opened the Mukachevo facility 13 years ago. The 600,000-square-foot plant employs over 2,600 people, producing molded plastics, electrical components, coffee machines, printer cartridges, and electronic price tags.\
\
Pressure on Moscow\
\
Trump has threatened new sanctions against Russia and its trading partners, including higher tariffs on India, one of Moscow's top oil buyers. Those measures are set to take effect next week.\
\
Despite Trump's attempts at diplomacy, Russia has shown no sign of relenting. Its latest wave of attacks underscores both the fragility of peace efforts and the pressure on Ukraine to maintain offensive operations as Trump insists. \

1mwhfgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mwhfgu/aitah_for_refusing_to_have_sex_with_my_boyfriend/,AITAH for refusing to have sex with my boyfriend on his birthday?,"Before hand, I want to warn that this is my first ever reddit post as I needed somewhere to confide and ask for unbiased opinions from people who have no emotional conection to the situation. 

I (19M), and my boyfriend (20M), have been dating for three years. (For context, I'm trans).
When I was sixteen, I began testosterone through  a private doctor, which my parents signed for, and had already been wearing binders since 14. At this time, I met my boyfriend, let's call him James, who was seventeen. We began talking, just as friends, but it quickly developed into an official relationship on the 19th of October 2022.

From my knowledge, James never had an issue with my transition and was really supportive, (For anyone who doesn't know, testosterone is basically a second puberty) and never failed to make me smile even through moodswings. He also took care of me all throughout my post top surgery.

We met each other's family, and practically everyone surrounding us was not only accepting but supportive of our relationship.

For two years, we hardly had any issues, and when I turned eighteen I moved into his apartment which we share with his roomate (20M), lets call him Charlie. Me and Charlie have always got along, and often, if we have time, read together or something. 

Me and James seldom had issues in those two years, and if we did, they were minor - like arguing over what to eat that night.'

Anyway, last week was James' birthday, (15th of August) and we had a small celebration in the apartment on that Friday night. Nothing too big, just me, James, Charlie, and Charlie's girlfriend, who I'd met only a few times.

I had made sure to leave time on the Friday to make a small cake, and even buy some snacks for the four of us, which I set out on the coffee table whilst we ate and watched movies on Netflix. 

Charlie had bought some cheap beers, and the three of them had a few to wash down their snacks, whilst I drank a cuppa (because I don't drink.) 

Sometime through the third movie of that night, I got up to make myself another tea. At this point James, Charlie and Charlie's girlfriend were at least tipsy and laughing over this and the other. 

I make my tea without issue, however, apon returning to the living room, I happened to hear my name being mentioned. I lingered just behind the door, hoping to catch a snippet of their conversation, only to meet a heartbreaking revelation that honestly crushed me.

They were discussing my body, and Charlie's girlfriend was outright mocking the scars on my chest (from top surgery). To make it worse, James was going along with it, and casually mentioned that I prefer to have it up the ass instead of my vagina - which is a comfort if anything, as I hate the thought of having something in my vagina. This is just my personal boundaries, and James has always agreed to abide and respect them. (I haven't had bottom surgery yet, and I honestly never planned on it.) 

The discussion continued for a little longer, and all three of them laughed and claimed that I was ""not a real man"".

Now, I've never had problems with James, and he's never brought up any discomfort or even dislike for my body or how we have sex. We have a relationship established on communication, and at even the smallest things, we ensure to talk about it to each other to keep our relationship healthy...or so I thought. 

I honestly thought this was a huge breach of privacy, as yes, I know Charlie well, and yes I've spoken to Charlie's girlfriend a few times, but our sex life is not for discussion outside of ourselves. Perhaps I'm over thinking in that aspect?

Continuing, I eventually returned to the group, but I found myself unable to concentrate on the film, and hardly interacted with the others, though I don't think they even noticed. 

I sat through at least another film in silence, and at this point it was around 2am. James dragged me to the bedroom, and he started to initiate sex, but their words kept echoing in my mind. 

I couldn't even take my shirt off before I began to cry. I left the room and went straight to the bathroom to compose myself. When I returned, James asked me what was wrong, and I blamed it on stress. We went to bed, and even in the heat, I refused to take my clothes off in front of him. 

The next morning, I woke up to James, who was completely ignoring me. 

According to Charlie, who was sat in the living room with his girlfriend, James was mad at me because I didn't have sex with him on his birthday. 

I thought that was unreasonable, especially after what I overheard, and got into a big argument with James, though I never told him why I wouldn't sleep with him the night before.

Now, I'm usually one for communication, and I believe no relationship ever lasts without talking to one another, but every time in the following two days that I tried to approach the topic, I ended in tears before I even began the conversation.

I haven't been able to undress in front of any of them or shower with James since, and even sleeping in bed, I have at least a shirt and boxers on. 

I don't know what to do, and I'm honestly contemplating staying with my mam and dad for a few days, just to gather my thoughts and give us both space, because right now it just feels cold.

So, was that just drunken talk or were they serious?

1mwhdvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mwhdvg/why_choose_waterdrop_wdwf10fg_whole_house_water/,Why Choose Waterdrop WD-WF10FG Whole House Water Filter Review for Cleaner Water?,"The **Waterdrop WD-WF10FG Whole House Water Filter** is a product I've integrated into my daily life to satisfy my eternal battle with water quality. Living in a region notorious for hard water filled with iron and manganese, this filter was a much-needed upgrade to our home’s filtration system. It’s designed to work with a 10"" x 4.5"" system, and the setup was refreshingly user-friendly. After weeks of use, here's the full review based on my first-hand experience. 

**Easy Installation and Sleek Design**  
Right out of the box, the first thing that struck me was its strong, no-nonsense build. The filter is crafted with food-grade polypropylene and high-quality granular activated carbon, which gives it a durable yet lightweight feel. It weighs approximately 5 pounds, which makes handling and installing straightforward. While I’m not exactly a seasoned DIYer, the compatibility with popular setups like GE GXWH40L and FXHTC made the process seamless—I just followed the instructions and was done in under 45 minutes.

**Highlights**  
- Extremely effective at reducing contaminants like iron, manganese, and chlorine.  
- The five-stage filtration system ensures purified water with an improved taste.  
- Compatible with various filtration systems such as Culligan RFC-BBSA and Whirlpool® models.  

[Check Waterdrop WD-WF10FG price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b099zr5rgf/)  

**Performance in Day-to-Day Use**  
Performance-wise, this filter was exceptional. Our water had a slight metallic taste before, which vanished after the first week. The filter claims to reduce iron by 99.3% and manganese by 96.8%, and based on my experience, it comes very close to this. It's a relief not having rust stains in appliances and sinks anymore. Additionally, the natural coconut shell GAC filter does wonders for improving taste, removing any unwelcome odors. My morning coffee tastes a lot better now, and my family no longer complains about the “weird aftertaste” in their drinking water.  

**Safety You Can Count On**  
As someone who is cautious about what gets into our water appliances, I appreciated that this product passed RoHS certification. It gives me peace of mind knowing that it doesn't introduce harmful materials while filtering water. Plus, its efficient filtration protects our fixtures, like the dishwasher, from accumulating rust and damage.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The six-month lifespan means fairly frequent replacements if you have a large household.  
- Not a budget option compared to some basic carbon filters.  
- It’s slightly bulkier than standard under-sink filters, so installation space might be an issue.  

**Other Options: Competing Products**  
Compared to competitors like the iSpring WGB21B and Culligan HD-950A, the Waterdrop filter manages to outperform them in certain areas, especially in iron and manganese filtration. However, the iSpring model offers a longer lifespan for filters, which may appeal more to those who prioritize fewer replacements. On the other hand, Culligan provides slightly smaller models, a great option if you’re really tight on space. What Waterdrop excels in, though, is affordability in relation to performance—it packs several premium features at a mid-tier price.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Looking at what this filter brings to the table, I’d say it’s worth the investment. Its ability to tackle multiple contaminants at once saves you from potentially needing extra filtration systems, and the improvement in water clarity, taste, and quality is priceless. Over time, it also extends the life of your water-based appliances, making it a cost-effective option when you consider the bigger picture.

I’d been alone for so long, it felt normal to ready kinky stories, or obey tasks for random men online. I thought entertaining misogynistic men while I solo play was totally normal. At least from the comfort of my own home!

But recently I had met Fay online! I was really excited about her. She and I hit it off quickly and we chatted about everything, life, family, work, guys, clothes, coffee shops, even journaling. She was 25, African American, beautiful, and really friendly. I found a really great friend. And that made me happy. I never told her too much about my nights alone, but i did tell her enough for her to know I was kinky and into being dirty entertainment for men. I didn’t think too much of it when she started hinting at her boyfriend wanting to meet me. She’d been dating you, a hot strong man for a while. I knew you and her were kinky but it was still very mysterious. 

Finally the day came, right before I got ready, Fay told me that you had requested I come I  a little white dress and heels. I thought it was weird that Fay’s boyfriend was telling me what to wear, but I listened. I got dressed up, did my short red hair into a cute bun, and picked my white dress out that let my thick thighs be in display. All my skin was pale white, very contrasting to Fay, so when I got to her house and she was wearing a very similar dress. I felt very insecure.

“Hi…” I said, giving her a kiss on her cheek. I noticed the collar around her neck….then I saw you, smiling deviously at me…

# Why ‘Silksong’ Took Seven Years to Make

The highly anticipated indie game has been in production for so long that it’s become an internet meme 

*Silksong* will be a 2D action-platformer set within a distinct, bug-filled world

\--

Hi everyone, and welcome to a special edition of Game On about a very special game that we’ll be playing quite soon.

# The wait is over

It’s surreal to write, but it’s true: *Silksong* will be out on Sept. 4.

After six years of near-total silence from the developers and enough feverish anticipation to make it the most wish-listed game on Steam, the sequel to the indie hit *Hollow Knight* is releasing in two weeks. Team Cherry, the small team behind both games, announced the news [Thursday in a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c).

**Why did it take so long?**

Often, such protracted development cycles are [caused by mismanagement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make) and result in painful burnout among the staff. But speaking to me last week on a video call from their office in Adelaide, Australia, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said that making *Silksong* has been nothing but a joyful process.

**“We’ve been having fun,” Gibson said. “This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things.”**

The lengthy production wasn’t the result of development challenges or obstacles, they said. They just needed all these years to ensure that *Silksong* was exactly the game they wanted to make.

“It was never stuck or anything,” Gibson said. “It was always progressing. It’s just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it.”

The *Silksong* saga started in 2017 when Team Cherry released *Hollow Knight*, an action-platformer set in [a vast world full of cartoon bugs](https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425). A Switch version, released the following year, added to the momentum. By the end of 2018, millions of fans were raving about its polished gameplay, distinct style and impeccable vibes. As of today, the game has sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry told me, making it one of the most successful independent video games ever.

Initially, Gibson and Pellen had planned to release an expansion pack revolving around Hornet, one of its key characters. But in February 2019, they announced that [the expansion had grown too big](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed) and would instead become a full-fledged sequel, titled *Silksong*.

*Hollow Knight* had been massive, and their plan at the outset was to build a smaller world for *Silksong*. To ensure that the game felt just as deep, they’d implement an elaborate quest system that would offer the player reasons to backtrack and revisit old locations. In contrast to *Hollow Knight*, which had a single town full of shops and characters to meet, there would also be multiple towns, each serving as a hub for quests.

“Even at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of *Hollow Knight* or probably exceed it,” Gibson said. “And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.”

It all came down to their development style, which may have been too much fun. Gibson and Pellen — who were joined by programmer Jack Vine, composer Chris Larkin and a few contractors who helped with programming and testing — started off by designing the core gameplay for Hornet, the game’s slick protagonist. From there, it was easy to implement and test out new ideas, even as the game grew bigger.

“We’re very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,” Gibson said. “Not exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that’s very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone’s off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person’s laughed, and that’s enough.”

“You’re always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,” Pellen said. “That stuff’s so nice. It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have kept going.”

**The downside of this methodology was that it could have lasted forever.**

“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” Gibson said. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”

During the development of *Hollow Knight*, Gibson and Pellen frequently posted game updates and talked to players. At the end of 2019, Team Cherry posted [one more update](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/11xf7azcuebhybgossfhdc0mphiqbs) about *Silksong*, then went silent — much to fans’ dismay.

“We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing,” Gibson said. “Because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it.’”

They wanted to be particularly cautious about avoiding spoilers. Much of the thrill of *Hollow Knight* came from accidentally stumbling upon secret passageways or breaking down walls to find hidden bugs. *Silksong* has plenty of its own secrets that they didn’t want to detail before the release.

Plus, they thought *Silksong* would be out much sooner.

“Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,” Pellen said. “Probably at the time we thought we’d go quiet for a year or two, then the game would come out.”

In 2020, as Covid disrupted most video-game productions around the world, Adelaide was able to stave off the worst of the pandemic, going months without new cases, which allowed Gibson and Pellen to continue plugging along on *Silksong*. “Seems a little odd knowing that the rest of the world has such a dramatic and isolating period,” Gibson said. “Here we were, going to cafés and having brunch.”

*Silksong* briefly resurfaced in 2022 during an Xbox event, which promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. Xbox doubled down on Twitter, saying the *Hollow Knight* sequel [would be out before June 2023](https://x.com/Xbox/status/1536035818275487746).

At the time, they all thought it was true. “We did genuinely believe that was the case,” Pellen said. “There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.”

But the game kept growing. *Silksong* has more elaborate bosses than *Hollow Knight*, more gameplay systems and more interactivity. Gibson and Pellen wanted objects in the world to react to Hornet’s various tools, which required a ton of drawing and animation work.

“I think we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things,” Gibson said. “It’s also that problem where, because we’re having fun doing it, it’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”

The longer development lasted, the more pressure Gibson and Pellen felt to ensure that everything was as fine-tuned as possible. They’d already spent four years on it — why would they rush now? The more time they spent polishing some parts, the more time they needed to apply it consistently across the rest.

“There’s a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game,” Pellen said. “All the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It’s multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases.”

Throughout development, Team Cherry remained tiny, which may have extended the production time but also saved them from the slog of having to manage and delegate. “We don’t want to mess with the formula and then find out it’s not fun,” Gibson said. “I used to manage teams in past lives. I don’t really want to do that ever again.”

Staying small also meant eschewing the production practices commonplace at many game-development studios.

“What is Jira?” Gibson said when I asked if they used the task-management application.

“Is it a software?” Pellen said, adding that they’d briefly used Trello before their account was deactivated because they didn’t use it enough.

As development dragged on, the hype for *Silksong* grew more feverish

Perhaps the biggest reason *Silksong* took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of *Hollow Knight*, they’d stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. “My dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,” Gibson said. “I’d be like, ‘Oh, I’m having coffee today!’”

Thanks to their first game’s massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that’s provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn’t changed much. “I live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,” he said. “Sometimes I think, ‘You know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.’ Because then there’s even less to maintain.”

The game has continued to generate revenue by reaching new players, perhaps in large part due to the *Silksong* buzz. When the studio announced *Silksong* in February 2019, *Hollow Knight* had sold 2.8 million copies. The game has sold another 12 million copies since then, allowing Team Cherry to keep working on the sequel indefinitely without having to worry about running out of funds.

“We’re very lucky in that regard,” Gibson said. “I don’t ever really think about it that much. Maybe that’s the privilege of it.”

As the years went on, the hype kept building. A Reddit forum [dedicated to the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/) filled up with nonsensical blabber and made-up tweets, which users called “silkposts,” a variation on the expletive. Meanwhile, chat sections for video-game livestreams and Nintendo Direct events were plagued with the same feral messages repeated over and over: “*Silksong* when?”

Gibson and Pellen tuned it all out, rarely going online. They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.

“It’s nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they’ve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,” Gibson said.

“Feels like we’re going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,” Pellen said.

Once in a while, people would show up at the Team Cherry office, sometimes with their children, perhaps hoping for a Willy Wonka type experience. Inevitably, they were disappointed by what they found instead. “It’s a grubby room with cardboard boxes,” Gibson said.

Their walls remain the same dull avocado color that they were when Team Cherry moved in more than a decade ago. They never even put up art. They’ve been too busy making the game.

In early 2025, Gibson and Pellen began to see the finish line and started making plans to release the game in the fall. Players desperate for information devoured every scrap of news — like the announcement that it would be [playable at a museum in September](https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum) — hoping this might finally be the year.

Both Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox said during live events this year that *Silksong* was planned for 2025, but fans were cautious. They’d been down this road before.

Meanwhile, Team Cherry kept working. The shape of the game has been finalized for a while, Pellen said. The last year or two has been all about the details — adding small encounters, polishing everything and tying it all together.

And they’re still working to finalize things until the last possible minute. As we spoke, with *Silksong* a little more than three weeks out, I spotted programmer Jack Vine in the background, tweaking code for one of the game’s console ports.

Gibson and Pellen say they’re happy that the game is finally coming out — and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven’t burned out or shown any desire to take a break. Instead, they’re already making big plans to add extra content to *Silksong* in the months and years to come.

**“Launching it is obviously quite exciting,” Pellen said. “What comes after for us is equally as exciting.”**

**“The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,” Gibson said. “We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.”**

**Stay tuned for 2032 to see how that turns out.**

I know that the majority of people being treated by doctors are usually elderly and retired but a lot of people work and they need to consider us too

I am expected to take a thyroid pill 2 hours before eating AND a PPI an hour before eating. The PPI would affect the absorption of the thyroid pill so it has to be taken separately. This means that everyday I have to wait THREE hours before I can have coffee and breakfast. I know a lot of people skip breakfast but I skip lunch because I hate eating in public. I asked if I could take my PPI a few hours after breakfast but no, it has to be in the morning because I guess they think everyone just sits around waiting to take pills all day. I'm just confused why they don't understand this is inconvenient for me. The disease that the PPI is treating is not that bad and I am asymptomatic with diet changes (it's caused by an allergy) so why is pill timing more of a problem?

I have been following the below regime and doing light exercise 2-3 times a week and have lost 9.5kg since june 21st. 

Weekdays: breakfast 1 apple and 1 milky coffee, lunch 1 slice sourdough, 1 cup soup and 1 apple, dinner - a plate with 1/3 dark green veg, 1/3 protein and 1/3 carb + a chocolate truffle for dessert. Average cals 1400

Weekends: 3 meals a day similar to my weekday dinner OR 1 takeaway meal and apples/tea. Average cals 2000. And I take multivitamins and fish oil

I have gone down from 114kg to 104.5kg. i will keep going until I get to 85 - my goal weight. I'll gradually increase exercise and eventually will stop with the calorie deficit and just have my weekend meals everyday plus the regular exercise which should hopefully keep me healthy and happy....

I’m just really not too convinced that I have Menieres. This is a lot so bear with me 

To start, I had chronic ear infections when I was a kid. Like clockwork every spring/winter I would get double ear infections. Not sure if that has anything to do with it but it’s something. 

I’ve struggled with headaches/migraines since I was 13. I’m currently on 100mg of topamax and don’t get daily headaches like I used to, only infrequent breakthrough migraines. My freshman year of college (I’m a junior now) I had what I assume is a vestibular migraine because I didn’t have any hearing problems which included vertigo and vomiting for like 24 hours straight, but nothing like that until now. I also recently in the past couple of months have started getting ocular auras, which I feel like could be connected since those are due to blood flow and ear issues can be related to blood vessel problems. 

Recently I also got my bloodwork taken and I’m subclinical to having hypothyroidism. This could be nothing, but if I do have that that could be another thing affecting my ears. 

My main issue is that all of my serious problems started right after a concert. I had no ear protection, and now I have mild hearing loss in my right ear as well as tinnitus and was followed by dizziness/vertigo? for a couple of weeks but the dizziness has subsided since then. 
The common triggers for Menieres: salt, coffee, and alcohol, do not affect my symptoms at all. I haven’t had dizziness or vertigo for weeks, besides one case of vertigo when i was sick and super congested. My ears also always get clogged when I’m sick so no surprise. 

Idk I might sound crazy and in denial because I’m 20 and do not want to worry about this at school😭but my main theory is I just had ssnhl from the concert which messed up my vestibular perception (I listen to music at full volume with my headphones on too, my ears could have just had enough) OR I have some kind of blood vessel problem which is why I’ve also randomly started getting migraine auras too.  

I know this is a lot and needs to be discussed with a doctor, but I’ve already tried, I’m between appointments, and they seem very quick to either say that these other things have nothing to do with it or just jump to Menieres. Any thoughts are appreciated ",2,1755796634.0,Menieres,3,1.0,False

I was on and off the field, but we'd pick right back up when I went to the sidelines.

Of course, regretting it when I got home, I only knew his name so I just looked at one my football friend's IG following list to see if he followed him. He did indeed and now I'm stuck... do I send him a DM? Ask him out to grab a drink or coffee to continue the conversation? He's public?

1mwh4rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/1mwh4rb/tetsutetsu_has_evolution_potential_horikoshi/,Tetsutetsu has evolution potential Horikoshi missed,"So Tetsutetsu is suppose to be maxed out on durability for Steel right? We all probably know Kirishima will always be better in hardness but Tetsutetsu has real potential Horikoshi may not have considered for quirk evolution. Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon but other elements can be used to create various versions of Steel.

Since his quirk directly converts ingested minerals into his metallic body, he isn’t limited by what humans can normally digest. This opens the door to other metals and alloys, provided he can consume trace amounts in food or supplements or even the material directly while in his steel form since his teeth turn to steel and his quirk being active would use that ingested material.

In canon MHA, Tetsutetsu has to take in iron from food or supplements to maintain his Steel quirk but there are other metals and maybe even materials he could evolve to that are lore friendly in the sense he would still have to intake the necessary mineral to sustain whatever metal/material he evolves to. Here are some options (it's a lengthy post but pretty realistic and lore friendly):

Titanium alloys (like Ti-6Al-4V):

They have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than steel, making them lighter yet comparably strong or tougher in many applications (aerospace, medical implants). They're also highly resistant to corrosion and fatigue, allowing better endurance in prolonged battles without rusting or weakening.

Required mineral and food sources: Titanium, often ingested as titanium dioxide (a common food additive for whitening and texture). Realistic foods include candies (like Skittles or peppermints), macaroni and cheese, soups, pastries, cheeses, gravy, coffee creamer, cake decorations, chewing gum, salad dressings, cottage cheese, and ice cream. These provide titanium in processed forms, similar to how iron is naturally present in spinach or meat.

Titanium dioxide is one of the most common food additives (used as a whitener in candies, frosting, chewing gum, etc).

His quirk could metabolize that source into titanium for body reinforcement, even though biologically titanium has no nutritional role for humans.


Chromium:

Chromium forms alloys like stainless steel or chrome-vanadium steel which are harder, more wear-resistant, and far better at resisting corrosion than plain steel. This would make his body tougher against acids, heat, or repeated impacts turning him into a more versatile tank.

Required mineral and food sources: Chromium, a trace mineral found naturally in many foods. High sources include grape juice, whole wheat flour, brewer's yeast, orange juice, beef, tomato juice, apples, broccoli, potatoes, meats, eggs, wheat germ, and oysters.

Vanadium:

Vanadium alloys (high-speed tool steel with vanadium) offer greater tensile strength, hardness, and impact resistance than standard steel especially under high stress or heat. This would allow him to withstand stronger attacks or deliver more powerful strikes without deforming.

Required mineral and food sources: Vanadium, a trace element in various foods. High sources include mushrooms, shellfish (lobster, oysters), black pepper, parsley, dill, vegetable oils, grains (rice, barley, wheat, buckwheat), cereals, skim milk, potatoes, hazelnuts, carrots, beer, and wine.

Molybdenum:

Molybdenum alloys (moly steel) provide superior high-temperature strength, toughness, and resistance to wear/creep compared to regular steel, ideal for enduring fiery or explosive quirks without melting or weakening.

Required mineral and food sources: Molybdenum, an essential trace mineral. High sources include legumes (black-eyed peas, lima beans, chickpeas, lentils, peanuts), whole grains, nuts, beef liver, leafy greens (spinach), potatoes with skin, bananas, dairy (yogurt, milk, cheese), rice, and eggs.

Cobalt:

Cobalt alloys (stellite or cobalt-chromium) are exceptionally hard, wear-resistant, and strong. They can outperform steel in high-friction or abrasive scenarios (cutting tools, implants). This would make him nearly unbreakable against grinding or slashing attacks.

Required mineral and food sources: Cobalt, primarily from vitamin B12-rich foods. High sources include fish, nuts, green leafy vegetables (broccoli, spinach), cereals (oats), meat, liver, apricots, beans, beer, beets, cabbage, cloves, cocoa, coffee, scallops, tea, whole grain flour, eggs, and dairy products.

Tungsten:

Tungsten carbide (a tungsten alloy) is vastly harder than steel (up to 9 on Mohs scale vs. steel's 4-6.5), with a melting point over 3,400°C (vs. steel's ~1,500°C), making it ideal for withstanding extreme heat, impacts, or cutting attacks without deforming. Its high density (19.3 g/cm³ vs. steel's 7.8 g/cm³) adds immense toughness and penetration resistance, turning his body into an unbreakable shield or drill-like weapon.

Required mineral and sources: Tungsten, trace in foods but scalable with high intake. High sources include grains (rice, wheat, barley, oats), onions, garlic, beans, potatoes, and seafood like tuna or shellfish. Supplements are an option here as well. Tungsten is available in some trace mineral complexes or as sodium tungstate in research-grade forms. Animal studies use tungsten-supplemented diets for metabolic effects, implying feasibility for high-dose intake.

Iridium:

Iridium is denser than tungsten (22.56 g/cm³) and more corrosion-resistant than steel, with alloys used in extreme environments (spark plugs, crucibles). It offers superior hardness and stability under radiation or chemical attacks, making his form nearly impervious to exotic quirks.

Required mineral and sources: Trace in meteorites/minerals, but negligible in standard foods. As a supplement it's available as colloidal iridium (nano-particles in water), marketed for cognitive enhancement (nutrient of consciousness) in doses of 5-10 ml daily, providing bioavailable iridium without ores.

Graphene:

Ingesting graphene while in his steel form could lead to some fascinating hypothetical outcomes. Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice is renowned for its exceptional strength (200 times stronger than steel by weight), flexibility, thermal/electrical conductivity, and lightweight nature. His steel teeth would likely allow him to chew and process graphene forms (like flakes, oxide powders, or even charred food sources containing trace graphene oxide) that a normal human mouth couldn't handle without damage.

Tetsutetsu may be inferior to Kirishima’s hardness but Tetsutetsu may be more versatile. Though, he would have to change his Pro Hero name from ""Real Steel"" to something like ""Real Forge"".",7,1755796548.0,BokuNoHeroAcademia,1,1.0,False
1mwh4pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mwh4pr/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Explore the Best Espresso Machine Breville Bambino Worth It,"Having tested the Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS for a solid three months, I can confidently say it blends convenience and quality like few others. As someone who starts every day with coffee, I’ve seen my fair share of espresso machines, but this brushed stainless steel beauty caught my eye not just for its aesthetics, but for the performance-packed features Breville never fails to deliver. From crafting espresso shots to frothing milk for lattes, this espresso maker transformed a simple morning routine into a café-worthy experience at home. Yet, not all is perfect. Let’s dive into this honest review, highlighting its strengths and shortcomings.

**Design That Fits Anywhere**

Sleek and compact, the Breville Bambino BES450BSS doesn’t hog counter space. Measuring just 13.7”D x 6.3”W x 12”H, I found it perfect for smaller kitchens, where space is a premium. With its minimalist brushed stainless steel finish, it’s attractive without being too flashy. The straightforward button interface simplifies the brewing process, and everything feels well-constructed. However, for such a compact machine, getting under the hood for a thorough cleaning is a bit of a challenge, particularly if you’re meticulous about maintenance. Despite that, the overall build quality is solid, and its lightweight nature (10.9 pounds) makes it easy to move if needed.

**Performance That Impresses**

This espresso machine delivers barista-level quality using a 54mm portafilter designed for 19 grams of coffee grounds, crucial for extracting full-bodied flavor. I’ve used it daily, and the low-pressure pre-infusion ensures even flavor extraction with every shot. The espresso comes out rich, aromatic, and balanced—something I wasn’t sure a semi-automatic machine in this price range could achieve. Precision temperature control (PID) maintains consistent water temperature, giving reliability shot after shot. Occasionally, though, the shot ran slightly longer than intended, requiring quick manual adjustment. For the most part, it performs fabulously.

**Automatic Milk Texturing for Café Creations**

The automatic steam wand stole the show for me. Adjusting milk texture and temperature is intuitive, and the machine produces smooth, velvety microfoam that enhances the flavors of a latte or cappuccino. It’s also perfect for attempting latte art, though if you’re an amateur, it’ll take some patience. This feature makes the Bambino an excellent choice for anyone who enjoys exploring different milk-based recipes, but I noticed the steam wand loses full pressure after multiple uses in quick succession. For high-volume use, it falters slightly, though for daily single-cup lovers like myself, it’s brilliant.

[Check Breville BES450BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0b1jppg2l/)

**Advantages**

- Compact design ideal for small spaces  
- Quick heat-up time using the Thermojet heating system (ready in 3 seconds!)  
- Automatic steam wand provides customizable microfoam for quality latte art  
- Precise espresso extraction with consistent flavor results  

**Caveats**

- Steam wand pressure diminishes if used repeatedly without breaks  
- Cleaning can be slightly cumbersome for thorough maintenance  
- Lacks built-in grinder, necessitating a separate purchase for fresh grounds  

**Other Options**

If you’re comparing options in the same category, machines like the De’Longhi Dedica or the Gaggia Classic Pro come to mind. The De’Longhi Dedica offers a similarly compact design but doesn’t quite match the Bambino’s rapid heat-up time or precise milk texturing features. Meanwhile, the Gaggia Classic Pro delivers traditional manual espresso performance and rugged durability but tends to intimidate first-time home brewers. Where Breville’s Bambino shines is the balance it strikes—providing advanced features without overwhelming novice users. Plus, the added convenience of automatic milk texturing makes it more versatile compared to its competitors.

**Affordable Quality**

While espresso machines can fetch some sky-high prices, this one comfortably sits in the mid-tier, delivering remarkable bang for your buck. Between the premium-quality espresso and features like PID temperature control and an automatic steam wand, you’re looking at a product that stands out for its value proposition. Add in its sleek design, and it’s hard not to consider the Bambino a smart investment. There are pricier alternatives that offer additional advanced tech, but for home use, this machine ticks all the right boxes.

As someone who dives deep into fighting games, I took this 7.41-pound beast through its paces, and I must say, it offers a mixed bag of impressive features and a few areas where it stumbles. Here’s what you need to know if you’re eyeing this device for your next round of Street Fighter 6 or Tekken 8.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed unboxing this arcade stick was its solid build. At 14.72 x 9.69 x 2.48 inches, it has just the right heft to prevent unwanted movement during intense matches. The buttons and joystick feel comfortably spaced, ensuring precise input without fumbling around. It’s also compatible with Sanwa Denshi parts, which lets you customize your setup further—a huge plus for gaming purists like myself.

However, the bulk can be a bit cumbersome if you're not setting it up on a dedicated gaming station. This isn’t the kind of device you casually toss into a backpack for a friend’s gaming night. But once it’s parked on a desk or coffee table, it feels as stable as concrete. That sturdiness definitely won me over during hours of Mortal Kombat action.

**Compatibility and Connectivity**  
This arcade stick’s compatibility is outstanding, covering PS5, Switch, Windows, Android, and a plethora of other platforms. Unfortunately, Xbox users are out of luck here—there’s no support for Xbox Series S or X unless you opt for the Mayflash F700X model. With three connection options—Bluetooth, 2.4G wireless, and wired—you have flexibility not often seen in arcade sticks. I tested all three modes, and while Bluetooth and wired options performed flawlessly, the 2.4G connection occasionally felt choppy. It could have been interference, but it’s worth considering if you’re a player who thrives on responsiveness.

**Performance in Fighting Games**  
Focused solely on fighting games, the MAYFLASH F700 is unapologetically niche. From Street Fighter 6 to Tekken 8, every input felt crisp and responsive, giving me that old-school arcade vibe I missed. The Turbo function is an interesting addition, offering different speed settings to lighten the finger fatigue during repetitive button smashing.

That said, it’s a one-trick pony. If you’re hoping to use it for other game genres or mix things up, you’ll be disappointed. But if you’re like me and thrive on blistering finishers and perfectly timed combos, the F700 delivers exactly what you need.

**User Experience and Features**  
One feature I didn’t expect but appreciated was the dedicated compartment for its 2.4G receiver. It’s such a practical design choice, preventing that panic moment of misplacing it before a match. The Turbo function worked seamlessly, although I admit I rarely needed to use it. Additionally, its support for wired headsets was a pleasant surprise—I was able to chat with friends while battling online on my PS5 without reaching for an extra cable.

On the downside, the arcade stick is powered by a lithium polymer battery, which is included, but there’s no official estimate on its longevity. While I didn’t experience any battery issues during my tests, it’s something worth keeping an eye on. A drained battery mid-tournament is a nightmare no one wants.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sturdy, high-quality design perfect for desk setups.  
- Excellent platform compatibility, covering most consoles and devices.  
- Customization options for joystick and buttons using Sanwa Denshi parts.  
- Three versatile connection options: wired, 2.4G wireless, and Bluetooth.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Doesn’t support Xbox Series S/X platforms.  
- Niche focus exclusively on fighting games; not suitable for multi-genre gaming.  
- Occasional input lag in 2.4G wireless mode under certain conditions.  

**Product Rivals**  
Stacking the F700 up against its competitors reveals how far it pushes the envelope in certain areas while falling behind in others. The Qanba Obsidian, for example, offers a sleeker, more ergonomic design but misses out on the versatility of multiple connection options. Meanwhile, the Hori Real Arcade Pro has an even sturdier build, yet it doesn’t include a wireless function at all.

Where the F700 excels is its compatibility—supporting such an extensive list of platforms (minus Xbox) makes it one of the most adaptable on the market. If you value wireless connections and platform versatility, the F700 is a clear winner. However, hardcore competitive gamers might lean toward the Obsidian for its slightly better joystick precision.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of cost-effectiveness, the MAYFLASH F700 offers plenty for the price without overshooting what you’d expect from an arcade stick in this category. Its platform versatility, customizable options, and durable construction more than justify its price tag. Of course, there are cheaper alternatives that do the basics, but if you’re serious about your fighting games, this product feels like it’s worth every penny.

1mwh487,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchPicks/comments/1mwh487/delve_into_best_laptop_deals_with_dell_inspiron/,Delve Into Best Laptop Deals with Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Review,"Testing out the Dell Inspiron 15 3000 on a daily basis was an experience that felt tailored to both work and leisure. I personally used this laptop for tasks ranging from video editing to light gaming, and even the everyday routine of writing these kinds of reviews. Straight out of the box, you notice it makes a statement with its sleek black design. From the specs on paper to real-world performance, there's a lot to unpack here. Whether you're eyeing it for professional use or college projects, it has plenty to offer—but, like any product, it's not without some quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This laptop doesn’t skimp on aesthetics. The black finish and slim profile make it look far more expensive than it is. It feels just as sturdy as it looks. Personally, I appreciated its lightweight build, especially during my commute, compared to lugging a bulkier machine. The anti-glare LED-backlit WVA screen not only reduces eye strain during long sessions but also makes outdoor use a breeze—though, truth be told, finding shade still makes a difference. That said, the build quality leans more ""functional"" than ""luxurious."" Don’t expect MacBook-level elegance, but for its price range, it checks all the right boxes.  

**Performance Under Pressure**  
Equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor (seriously, 10 cores with a 4.7GHz Turbo Boost? Yes, please!) and a whopping 64GB of DDR4 RAM, this model flew through everything I threw at it. Multitasking felt effortless. I had Adobe Premiere, Spotify, and about 15 Chrome tabs open simultaneously—yet there was no hint of lag. Even rendering a 4K video for a client presentation took far less time than I anticipated. Plus, the 2TB PCIe SSD is no joke when it comes to storage and speed. Boot times are practically nonexistent. However, casual gamers like me may notice that while Intel Iris Xe Graphics performs solidly for smaller games, bigger AAA titles might need settings dialed back.  

[Check Dell Inspiron 15 3000 price on Amazon.](https://multipowers.com/p/b081n6ctdy/)  

**Display Features**  
The Full HD 15.6-inch display is crisp and vibrant, making binge-watching Netflix all too easy. It was especially impressive when editing photos; colors remained accurate and lively, making my Lightroom sessions way better than expected. While the anti-glare screen is a huge plus, I wouldn’t tout this as the brightest display on the market. Working in a coffee shop by a sunlit window had me cranking up the brightness to its max. Still, for indoor settings, it shines—pun intended.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Snappy performance thanks to a 10-core i7 processor and Intel Iris Xe Graphics.  
- Massive storage: 2TB SSD plus an additional 512GB with the included docking set.  
- Lightweight and portable design ideal for students or traveling professionals.  

**Limitations**  
- The brightness could use a little more oomph for better visibility under intense sunlight.  
- While it's a beast for multitasking, hardcore gamers might need a dedicated GPU for optimal performance.  
- Some of the bundled peripherals, like the Ethernet cable or charging dock, feel like they were added for quantity more than quality.  

**Battery and Efficiency**  
One of the biggest perks for me was the long-lasting battery life. Unlike my old laptop that barely lasted through a meeting, this machine’s battery kept going for an entire workday (and more). And when I needed to juice it up, ExpressCharge was surprisingly fast—it was practical for my “always rushing” lifestyle. Windows 11 Pro also impressed me with its AI features. It genuinely felt like tasks were done faster, though I imagine the immense RAM also deserves credit there. With additional software like Microsoft Office Lifetime pre-installed, the machine positions itself as ready to work right out of the box.  

**Competing Brands**  
Going head-to-head with other brands in this category, such as HP’s Pavilion series or Lenovo’s IdeaPad models, this laptop’s specs blow mid-range competitors out of the water. Compared to an HP Pavilion I tested last year, this Inspiron model stands out with double the RAM and more significant SSD storage. However, Lenovo IdeaPads often come with slightly better graphics performance for a comparable price. If you're a student or casual user looking for a mix of performance and storage, Inspiron is the obvious choice, but graphic-intensive users might lean towards Lenovo for the visuals.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the combination of features—10-core i7 processor, Full HD display, and immense DDR4 RAM—this product delivers strong value relative to its price tag. Sure, the lack of a dedicated GPU might deter a small pool of shoppers, but for most users, it’s hard to argue against its sheer versatility and speed. It works seamlessly across various settings, from handling PowerPoint presentations to rendering YouTube videos. It's one of those rare machines that feels like it's doing more than it costs.

**TL;DR of the post**

* *ChatGPT often does not include clickable links, just brand mentions, so users are searching Google for your brand after getting recommendations from ChatGPT.*
* *ChatGPT’s traffic is likely therefore getting mis-counted as Google and other search traffic.*
* *ChatGPT Mobile and Desktop app traffic does not pass referrer or UTM data so is likely not getting attributed*
* *Informational sites that monetize through ads or affiliates are likely seeing a drop overall as their sites or brands are not mentioned by ChatGPT.*
* *To get a better gauge of ChatGPT impact: monitor branded searches in Search Console, track server-side bot scraping, and use AI visibility tools to see relatively how often you’re mentioned versus competitors*

We also ran a little experiment and went more in depth on what queries generate links and what kind of links are appearing.   A quick summary.

Drinks now cost more than dinners, and no one blinks. Today, alcohol and not‑alcohol blur together in menus that read like magic spells. The glass has become a statement piece, a ticket to be photographed, tagged, and believed. You don’t just drink anymore. You perform with the drink. Wrist tilted just enough with condensation on the stem and smoke curling slowly over ice, glowing under bar light. Garnishes glittering, hanging like ornaments built for Instagram rather than mouths.

The drink is bait. The drink is spectacle. The drink is how a place announces itself. The bar has become the stage, and each cocktail is a line in the script. Limes and syrups and powders imported from health fads, fashion weeks, reality shows, TikToks. Torches crackle behind the well. Dry ice clouds the table. Somewhere beneath the sugar, spice, matcha, CBD, or coffee, there’s still the same need: people searching for something to carry them a little further into the night. This is what is carrying people tonight:

**The Undisputed Champions: Top Best-Sellers That Rule Every Menu**

**Margaritas**

The margarita remains America's undisputed cocktail champion, leading searches in 26 out of 50 states. It isn't your basic lime-and-salt situation anymore. Spicy Margaritas are exploding on social media, with jalapeño and chili variations becoming the most viral cocktail trend of summer 2025. Restaurants report these fiery twists are driving both foot traffic and social media engagement.

**Old Fashioned**

Ranking as the second most searched cocktail, the Old Fashioned is experiencing a renaissance with innovative twists. Bars are introducing smoked variations and flavored syrups while maintaining the drink's classic appeal to traditional cocktail lovers.

**Espresso Martinis**

The espresso martini has become the third most popular cocktail nationwide, with some chain restaurants reporting an increase as much as 40% over last year. This caffeinated cocktail perfectly captures Gen Z's love for both coffee culture and nightlife, making it a must-have for any restaurant targeting younger demographics.

**Health-Conscious Revolution**

**Matcha Surges**

Matcha menu placement increased 21.6% from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025, with some chains reporting 50% year-over-year growth for matcha drinks.

**Functional Beverages**

The functional beverage market reached $9.2 billion with 54% growth from 2020-2024. Nearly 80% of consumers want restaurants to offer more functional beverages, and many are willing to pay premium prices for drinks that deliver health benefits. Popular options include:

· **Adaptogenic Beverages** with stress-relief properties

· **Kombucha Spritzers** for digestive health

· **CBD-Infused Mocktails** for relaxation

· **Nootropic Drinks** for cognitive enhancement

**Viral Drinks Driving Traffic**

**Dirty Sodas**

Thanks to reality TV and TikTok, dirty sodas have exploded nationwide. These customized sodas with flavored syrups, creams, and add-ins represent one of summer 2025's biggest surprises. These sodas are being served with or without alcohol. Chains like TGI Fridays have launched entire dirty soda menus. McDonald's is currently testing ""Dirty Sodas"" in 500 locations.

**Is It Instagram Worthy**

89% of diners research online before visiting a restaurant, making visual appeal crucial. Trending viral cocktails include:

· **Clarified Cocktails** with a crystal-clear appearance

· **Color-Changing Drinks** that transform when mixed

· **Smoke-Infused Presentations** for dramatic effect

· **Edible Glitter** and dramatic garnishes

**What's Hot Where**

The beverage landscape varies dramatically by region, with distinct preferences emerging across the United States:

· **West Coast**: Margaritas dominate, with strong interest in Matcha Drinks and Craft Cocktails

· **Northeast**: Martinis lead, especially Espresso and Wine-Based Cocktails

· **Midwest**: Old Fashioned Variations reign supreme alongside Craft Beer

· **South**: Margaritas and Sweet Tea Innovations drive sales

· **Southwest**: Spicy margaritas and Agave-Based Spirits lead trends

**The Non-Alcoholic Revolution: Sober-Curious Drives Innovation**

**Gen Z Leads the Charge**

65% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials plan to reduce alcohol consumption in 2025. This shift is creating massive opportunities for sophisticated non-alcoholic options:

· 40% of restaurants plan to expand non-alcoholic drink offerings in 2025

· Nonalcoholic Beverage sales soared 30% in 2024

· Venues generating $2 million annually saw average revenue boosts of $95,000 by expanding nonalcoholic menus

**Premium Mocktails Command Premium Prices**

A thoughtfully crafted $9 mocktail often surpasses the margins of a traditional $14 cocktail, making this category incredibly profitable for operators who execute it well.

**The Profitability Picture: What Makes Money**

Based on industry data, here's what's driving the most profit in restaurant beverage programs:

**Highest Margin Categories:**

· **Signature Cocktails**: 75-80% profit margins

· **Specialty Sodas**: 75-85% profit margins

· **Coffee Drinks**: 70-80% profit margins

· **Nonalcoholic Cocktails**: 70-75% profit margins

**Volume Leaders:**

· **Craft Beer**: 47% of pizzerias rate it 8+ out of 10

· **Wine**: 28% of operators report strong performance

· **Specialty Cocktails**: 20% report high sales performance

**Technology and Innovation Shaping the Future**

**Cold Brew and Coffee Innovation**

Cold Brew continues strong momentum, with younger consumers who grew up with cold coffee now coming of age. Operators are adding flavored cold brew options and upscale afternoon service to capture this growing market.

**What This Means for Restaurant Operators**

The beverage landscape in 2025 is being driven by several key factors:

1. **Social Media Influence**: Visual appeal and shareability drive customer acquisition

2. **Health Consciousness**: Functional benefits are becoming table stakes

3. **Demographic Shifts**: Gen Z's preferences are reshaping entire categories

4. **Profitability Focus**: Beverages offer higher margins than food in many cases

5. **Experience Economy**: Drinks are becoming part of the overall dining experience

**The Bottom Line**: Restaurants that embrace innovative beverages, prioritize visual appeal, offer functional benefits, and cater to health-conscious consumers are seeing significant revenue growth and customer loyalty improvements. The beverage game has never been more important or more profitable for restaurant success.

1mwgzbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mwgzbx/bridal_boot_camp_free_read_online/,Bridal Boot Camp Free Read Online,"Chapter One  
  
  I tried not to stare at the guy who stood in the back of the room, but it wasn’t easy, first because he was the only guy in a room full of women, and second because he was fit.  
  
  Not just fit, but hard, not an ounce of fat on him. He obviously worked out. He had shoulders that looked as if they’d been carved from slabs of marble, and his biceps were sick: round and thick and darkly tanned. He was clean-shaven with a head full of nicely curled dark hair, and his workout clothes were crisp and clean, though they’d seen some wear.  
  
  But he’d laid out a spin mat instead of a yoga mat, so something was off. The guy knew his way around a gym, all right, but not a spin or yoga class.  
  
  So what the hell was he doing in bridal boot camp?  
  
  It was obvious my clients wanted to know, too. They were eyeing him like he was a pumpkin spice latte on the first day of fall. Even Lauren, who was engaged to one of the most highly regarded NFL prospects out of the University of Florida, couldn’t take her eyes off him.  
  
  Meanwhile, her mother, Connie, was glaring at me. She wasn’t paying a hundred grand for two hundred guests to chow down on surf and turf over at the Cascabel Hotel just to have her daughter get thirsty for some new guy at the gym and cancel the wedding a month before the big day.  
  
  I knew I had to do something, and fast.  
  
  “Hey,” I said, sidling up to Biceps as he checked his cell for messages. “What class are you here for?”  
  
  “Uh, yoga,” he said, lowering his phone. “This is six o’clock yoga, right?”  
  
  I knew it. He was in the wrong class. Just my luck. At least the way my luck’s been running lately.  
  
  “No,” I said. “We only have a six o’clock yoga class here on Wednesdays. This is boot camp.”  
  
  “Bridal boot camp,” Lauren added, her blue eyes glittering with either malice or delight—with Lauren it was always hard to tell. “To get in shape before your wedding.”  
  
  “Or a wedding you’re attending,” Connie said, flashing her daughter a look of warning. “You don’t actually have to be getting married yourself to be in this class.”  
  
  “You’re not getting married, are you?” Anna asked in her heavy Cuban accent, sending a hopeful glance toward Biceps’s left ring finger. I wasn’t the only one who’d noticed it was conspicuously absent of jewelry.  
  
  “Uh, no,” Biceps said, looking adorably confused, especially as Patrick, the only other male in my class (he was marrying Bill, his longtime partner, in a beachside ceremony at the Sandy Point state park in August), chose that moment to burst through the door from the men’s locker room.  
  
  “Sorry I’m late, girls, you would not believe the traffic on the Circle—wait one second. What in the name of sweet hunk of man meat do we have here?”  
  
  I could have sworn Biceps began to blush under his tan.  
  
  “Uh,” he said, slipping his cell back into his gym bag. “I looked online and it said there was a yoga class here at six—”  
  
  “There is.” I was beginning to feel sorry for the guy—and one reason I’m such a popular trainer is that I’m known for not taking pity on anyone, especially clients.  
  
  But Patrick and the rest of the ladies were staring at Biceps as intently as if he was a gazelle who’d wandered into the middle of a lion’s den. A pretty built gazelle, but still.  
  
  “Yoga’s only on Wednesday nights,” I said. “And every morning at eight.”  
  
  His dark eyebrows constricted. “I can’t make Wednesday nights. Or mornings. I work eight to four every day. I’m a deputy with the sheriff’s office.”  
  
  I could almost hear the ripple of ecstasy that swept through the ladies—and Patrick—at his words. A male first responder—and one with extremely pronounced triceps—in our gym? It seemed too good to be true.  
  
  Given my luck, I knew it would be.  
  
  “Then what are you doing here?” I asked, lowering my voice so the others couldn’t hear. “I know they have a state-of-the-art gym over at the sheriff’s department. And you obviously use it. You didn’t get those lats sitting around doing paperwork all day.”  
  
  He glanced down at his own shoulder as if to see what I was talking about and then, adorably, blushed again.  
  
  “Oh, yeah,” he said. “Well, I lift.”  
  
  Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. What did he lift, boulders?  
  
  “I was involved in a, um, incident,” he went on, his voice as low as mine. “And the sheriff—you know Sheriff Hartwell, right?”  
  
  I nodded. Everyone on the island knew Sheriff Hartwell. In addition to having cut crime in half since being elected—not that there’d ever been much crime on Little Bridge Island in the first place, aside from the occasional illicit drug use and fishing violations—the sheriff also gamely rode in an evening gown on a float in the gay pride parade every year, even though he himself was hetero. This made him beloved not only to the Patricks of the island, but also the Laurens and the Connies, too.  
  
  “He gave me a disciplinary action,” Biceps went on. “And part of it is that I have to start taking yoga, in order to curb some of what he calls my, uh, male aggression.”  
  
  I raised my eyebrows. The male part I liked—more than liked. I welcomed it with open arms. It had been eleven months since Pete and I had broken up (not that I was counting), and I hadn’t had sex since, despite my best friend Jenna’s insistence that I needed to get back into the game.  
  
  And I’ve been trying. I really have. I’ve kept up with my hair appointments—highlights and lowlights once a month on my shoulder-length bob, so I look like the natural blonde I’ve never been—and spray tans and mani-pedis every two weeks. I watch what I eat—no processed carbs, refined sugar, or excessive alcohol. You’d think I was the one about to get married.  
  
  But who would I marry, anyway? When you live on a two-mile-by-four-mile island, you can’t exactly count on Tinder to meet people, since you’ll most likely see your date the following morning at the grocery store or coffee shop, making for an awkward situation all around if things haven’t gone well.  
  
  And with me they almost never g  
o well, because I’m not settling for just anyone anymore. I want the real thing, the whole package, the made-for-TV-movie rom-com. I want it all.  
  
  That’s why the aggression part this guy is describing . . . well, that part I’m not so thrilled with.  
  
  “What kind of incident?” I asked. I didn’t need some psycho cop in my gym, especially in bridal boot camp. Standing ten feet away was Bettina, the mayor’s wife, who was trying to tighten up her arms a little before her niece’s wedding in Tampa so that she could do the chicken dance without jiggling.  
  
  “Oh,” he said, blushing more deeply, if such a thing were possible. “It was just—It was stupid, really. A misunderstanding outside the Circle K. I was in my squad car and I’d pulled over so I could get a cup of coffee and came out to find what I thought was some mope going after my partner, Chrissie. So I drew on him.”  
  
  I sucked in my breath disapprovingly. “Your gun?”  
  
  Biceps stiffened. “No. No way! Just my Taser.”  
  
  “Oh, well, that makes it so much better.”  
  
  He winced at my sarcasm and had the grace to look even more embarrassed. “Yeah, I know . . . it was dumb of me. But you know how it’s been lately. People aren’t big fans of cops right now, and I really was in fear for my life. Well, Chrissie’s life.”  
  
  I had a ton of questions. Like why hadn’t his partner, Chrissie, drawn her own Taser if she’d been in such a dire situation?  
  
  And who bought coffee at Circle K? Everyone knew they served much better coffee at Island Coffee Queen, or even Starbucks, for God’s sake.  
  
  But before I could ask any of these things, he went on. “Anyway, the guy turned out to have only been a concerned citizen—and a decent one, at that. He’s not pressing charges or anything. But Sheriff Hartwell says I have to take yoga in order to learn how to deal with the stress of the job, figure out how to breathe, and all that mumbo jumbo.”  
  
  “It’s not mumbo jumbo,” I said. I was used to people—especially men—with Biceps’s attitude. I respected what the sheriff was trying to do. “People have been practicing yoga for literally thousands of years. It’s almost universally accepted to promote health and relaxation. You know a lot of insurance companies pay for it now as a form of rehab for PTSD and after accidents?”  
  
  He looked surprised. “Really? I didn’t know. No offense, it’s just that some of the guys have been ragging me a little for having to take a—”  
  
  Fortunately Bettina interrupted before he could dig himself a deeper hole.  
  
  “Pardon me, Robbie,” she called from over by the weight rack, “but is this class going to get underway soon? I have the Red Cross gala at eight and I need to get home in time to do my hair—”  
  
  I nodded and said, “Yes, of course. Everybody who hasn’t already grabbed a mat, grab one—a yoga mat, not a spin mat—as well as two three-pound weights, a ten-pound weight, and a heavy ball. We’ll get started in one minute.”  
  
  Turning to Biceps, I said impulsively, having made a split-second decision against my better judgment—which Jenna always reminds me never works out well, “I think I can help you. Well, teach you how to breathe, anyway. Right now your fitness regimen is only lifting weights, right? You don’t do anything aerobic?”  
  
  He looked defensive. “Isn’t lifting weights aerobic?”  
  
  “No,” I said. “It’s good,” I rushed to assure him when the defensiveness grew. “It’s great for you, actually, but it’s clearly not helping much where you need it right now. This class will. I know it’s called bridal boot camp, but it’s really just a general aerobic fitness class, with a little yoga thrown in. It should meet your sheriff’s requirements. What’s your name?”  
  
  “Ryan Martinez,” he said, holding out his right hand.  
  
  “Hi, Ryan,” I said, and stretched out my own hand. “I’m Rob—Roberta—James.”  
  
  “I know,” he said, as my slim hand disappeared into his own warm, massive one. “I saw your picture on the website. You’re the owner.”  
  
  “Co-owner,” I corrected him. “But yeah, I am.”  
  
  I couldn’t help noticing how clear and focused his hazel eyes were as he looked down at me . . . and the electricity that seemed to shoot from his fingers into mine as he squeezed them. If this happened to all the ladies he met, it was a mystery how he’d stayed single this long.  
  
  If he was single. He could be shacking up with his partner, Chrissie, for all I knew. He certainly seemed to have a thing for her, considering how protective he was of her.  
  
  Which was exactly how guys in rom-coms always were of their girlfriends.  
  
  “Great,” I said, dropping his hand, my fingers still tingling from the contact. “Let’s get started. You’ll need to switch out the mat you’ve got there for one of those blue ones in the corner. What you’ve got is a spin mat. You’ll need a yoga mat.”  
  
  He looked sweetly perplexed. “There’s a difference?”  
  
  “Big difference,” I said with a wink. “You’ll see in a minute.”  
  
  Then I leaped to the front of the room and switched on my iPhone. The pulsating beats of Rihanna’s latest soon reverberated from the speakers in all four corners. I began doing deep knee bends, my back to the mirrored wall behind me.  
  
  “Everyone, meet Ryan,” I said, raising my voice to be heard over the music. “He’s going to be joining us today.”  
  
  The catcalls and sly greetings were immediate. “Hi, Ryan.” “Welcome, Ryan.” “Ryan, can I have your number?”  
  
  “Come on now, ladies . . . and gentlemen,” I said. I felt jazzed but slightly nervous, considering I’d done this routine a thousand—maybe ten thousand—times before. I knew it was because of my newest class member. He was clueless, but undeniably cute. “Leave Ryan alone. You know the drill. It’s time for your favorite thing in the world . . . squats! As many as you can do in sixty seconds. On my count. And . . . GO!”  
  
  He tried to keep up.  
  
  I’ll give him that. He really tried. We lost him somewhere around the thirty-minute mark—and the class was only forty-five minutes, including cooldown—while doing planks. He could probably bench his own body weight, but he couldn’t plank. He didn’t have the core strength.  
  
  This was pretty common with self-trained weightlifters. They went for exercises that would give them those all-desirable flashy six-packs—and the glimpses I got of his when his faded black tank fell away from his body showed that his were mightily attractive—but they neglected ones that would actually help stabilize and strengthen their core.  
  
  The other girls in the class—and Patrick—smirked playfully at Ryan as they effortlessly held their poses . . . but not too much, out of respect to his job. He was a first responder—and a gorgeous one—so that had won him a lot of points in their eyes.  
  
  When the exercise portion of the class was over, and I gave everyone permission to sit on their mats, he collapsed in a heap on his, sweat pouring from his dark, curly mane.  
  
  “Jesus Christ,” I heard him mutter as he looked around at all his classmates, none of whom had broken more than a light shimmer of perspiration, including Bettina, who was more than sixty pounds overweight and had barely hit her water bottle. His was empty.  
  
  But Bettina had been working out with me for two solid years. She could hold a plank for half an hour and not raise her heart rate above resting.  
  
  “Okay,” I said, turning off the music. “Let’s have a quick talk about nutrition before we leave for the night. How has everyone’s diet been this week? Anyone have any questions for me?”  
  
  Lauren raised her hand. Lauren always raised her hand. At five foot two and a hundred pounds, Lauren was technically underweight, but she’d talked her parents into allowing her to purchase a ten-thousand-dollar wedding gown that was a size too small (it had been on sale, marked down from nineteen thousand dollars), and so she felt she needed to lose an inch around the waist to fit into it.  
  
  Even thinking about it made me feel crazy. I loved weddings—which was why I held the class every year during wedding season.  
  
  Wh  
at I did not love was how nuts weddings made some brides—such as Lauren—get.  
  
  “I was so bad,” Lauren said with a simper when I pointed at her. “I ate four bananas this past weekend.”  
  
  “Bananas aren’t bad for you,” I said. “As I’ve stressed repeatedly, fruit is very, very good for you. If you have a weight-loss goal, you might want to restrict your fruit intake to before two o’clock in the afternoon so you have a chance to burn the calories off by the evening. But once again, fruit is a great form of nutrition.”  
  
  Lauren nibbled her lower lip. “But what if you eat it in a smoothie? With ice cream? And chocolate syrup?”  
  
  “Oh my God, Lauren!” cried Lauren’s mother. “How are you ever going to fit into that ridiculous dress that you made us buy if you keep drinking chocolate shakes? Even with bananas, you know those aren’t good for you!”  
  
  “You see?” Lauren cried, flashing her blue eyes at me. “You see how she treats me? I should elope.”  
  
  “Who else has a nutrition question?” I asked, wishing Lauren would elope, and sell her stupid, overpriced, too-tight dress on eBay.  
  
  Anna raised her hand to confess that she’d eaten beans, and I had to assure the group once again that beans were a nutritious and healthful component of any diet and everyone needed to stop being afraid of beans, despite what they might have heard from certain websites or doctors on TV.  
  
  Then Patrick raised his hand to snarkily ask if vodka was also a nutritious and healthful component of any diet, and I knew we’d descended into post-workout bridal madness. I told everyone to put their mats and weights away, then hit the showers.  
  
  As he was limping painfully toward the doors to the men’s locker room, having hung up his weights and mat, I couldn’t help asking Ryan, in a playful voice, “So will I see you at yoga tomorrow night?”  
  
  “Oh,” he said, swinging that clear-eyed hazel gaze on me. I felt another electric shock, but tried to hide it by bending to sort the weights. “No, I thought I mentioned—I can’t make Wednesday nights. I have a, um, thing.”  
  
  Behind me, I heard Patrick, who’d been putting away his weights, begin to whistle the tune to the song “Anchors Aweigh”—his snarky way of suggesting that Ryan was in Alcoholics Anonymous, which everyone on the island referred to as Anchors Aweigh, and which everyone also knew met Wednesdays at six o’clock in the basement of the Lutheran church.

Oh, that’s right,” I said, dropping the weight ball I’d been holding on Patrick’s foot. “You mentioned that earlier.”  
  
  “OW,” Patrick cried in mock pain. It had only been a four-pound ball, so I knew he was faking it.  
  
  “So will we see you here in class next week, then?” I asked Ryan. “Have we converted you?”  
  
  He grinned. He was still sweating so profusely that he had to reach up with one of the towels we provided and wipe his face and head, leaving his dark hair tousled more than ever. With the grin and the tousled hair, he was so good-looking that it was all I could do to keep from throwing myself at him and humping his leg.  
  
  “You know what?” he said. “I think so. This class was really neat.”  
  
  Neat. A part of me died inside. In a good way.  
  
  “Maybe you could bring Chrissie next time,” I said, unable to help myself. “You know, since you liked it so much.”  
  
  “Really?” Ryan looked happily surprised. “That would be okay?”  
  
  “Why wouldn’t it?” Even as I asked, I was internally kicking myself. Why couldn’t I keep my big mouth shut? I didn’t want to meet his stupid partner slash girlfriend, who was probably some ubertall skinny blonde super cop. I didn’t need to invite that kind of competition. Of course, I was blonde, too, but not a natural blonde, and nowhere near tall or skinny. “We always welcome new members.”  
  
  “That’d be super, actually,” Ryan said. “Chrissie and I go everywhere together. Well, almost everywhere.”  
  
  “Great.” I kept a smile frozen on my face. Yeah, great. Just great. What is wrong with you, Rob? “So I guess I’ll see you both here next week.”  
  
  “You will,” he said. His grin widened, revealing teeth so white and even, he could have been in an ad to promote milk as part of a healthy diet. Or the star of his own rom-com. “You know, you were right about this class. It was really hard—I thought I was going to die, actually, at one point. But I feel better already. Looser, you know? Lighter, in a way.”  
  
  “Oh, really?” I couldn’t help smiling back at him—for real, this time—even though I was still a little weirded out about the Chrissie thing. I always loved hearing that I’d helped someone. It was the best part of my job. “That’s good. That’s how I was hoping you’d feel. Not the part about dying, of course.”  
  
  He laughed. “I don’t know how you ladies do it. You’re all so tiny, but you were doing those exercises and holding those poses like they were nothing.”  
  
  I grinned at him. Tiny? Was he kidding? “How tall do you think I am?”  
  
  He said, without hesitation, “Five four.”  
  
  “Right.” I’d expected him, a cop trained to observe, to get that right. “And how much do you think I weigh?”  
  
  “One ten, one fifteen.” Again, no hesitation. And he wasn’t trying to flatter me, either. He wasn’t trained for that.  
  
  “Wrong,” I said. “One fifty-five.”  
  
  He looked stunned. “No shit. I mean, excuse me—no way do you weigh that much.”  
  
  “I assure you,” I said, “I do.” I flexed one of my own biceps. “All muscle, baby. We ladies may look tiny, but we’re made of muscle, and muscle is leaner and denser than fat. That’s what bridal boot camp is all about. Turning mush into metal. And everyone’s got some mush they need toughening up somewhere. Even you.”  
  
  He lowered his gaze as if I’d touched a sensitive spot. “Yeah. Maybe you’re right. Bye, Roberta.”  
  
  “Bye.” I waved as he disappeared into the men’s locker room, wondering what I’d said wrong.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  I was still wondering after I’d showered and changed. I’d lingered in the laundry room, washing towels, until I was sure he was gone before I bounced into reception, where Jenna was manning the desk.  
  
  “Sheriff’s deputy, huh?” She grinned at me.  
  
  Word travels like wildfire around a gym. It’s even worse in a gym on a small island.  
  
  “Don’t get too excited,” I said. “He’s got a partner.”  
  
  “Partner partner?” she asked. “Or life partner?”  
  
  “I don’t know. Possibly both. Her name is Chrissie. They go almost everywhere together, and he’s real protective of her.”  
  
  She rotated the screen of the computer monitor she’d been gazing at toward me. “I googled him already. No partner listed on the sheriff’s website. I don’t see any Chrissies who work there, either. Or Christines, or whatever.”  
  
  “Dammit, Jen.” This is the problem with being best friends with your coworker, and co–business owner. “Just for once I’d like to have a crush on a guy without you cyber-stalking him.”  
  
  “In this day and age, you can’t be too careful,” Jenna said, turning the screen back toward herself. “Remember what happened with Pete.”  
  
  “As if I could forget.”  
  
  Pete had, of course, turned out to be a disaster. A church-going charter boat captain, Pete had looked like total rom-com material—Jenna had cyber-stalked him, too, and given him her seal of approval . . . which, coming from a happily married mother of two like Jenna actually meant something.  
  
  But things had turned sour when I’d begun to notice money missing out of the gym’s petty cash, then out of my personal accounts. A few months and many accusations later, Pete was gone from the island, along with most of my savings, my laptop, my grandmother’s pearl brooch, and an exotic dancer named Katarina.  
  
  That memory caused me to ask, “Does it say anything on there about an incident Ryan was involved in not too long ago?”  
  
  “What kind?” Jenna squinted as her fingers flew over the keyboard.  
  
  “I don’t know. But he said that’s why he’s here. The sheriff is making him take yoga as part of his disciplinary action.”  
  
  Jenna let out a bark of laughter. “God, I’d love it if someone forced me to do yoga as some sort of disciplinary action.”  
  
  “Yeah, well, you’re not a six foot four cop with anger issues.”  
  
  “Sheriff’s deputy.”  
  
  “Whatever. Find anything? He said it involved his partner, Chrissie.”  
  
  “It must not have been worthy of local press coverage,” Jenna said, still squinting at the screen, “because nothing’s coming up.”  
  
  “Are you sure? It sounded kind of serious. He pulled his Taser on a guy outside the Circle K—”  
  
  “No, nada. Aw, but here.” She swung the monitor toward me again. “Here’s an article about how he gives free ukulele lessons to kids at the Mermaid Café every Wednesday night—”  
  
  I stared. “Excuse me?”  
  
  “Ukulele lessons. See? Look at this photo of him with the little kids! Oh my God, it’s so cute I think I just grew a third ovary . . .”  
  
  I bent over the desk so I could see the photo more clearly. Jenna was right. The photo was in a section of The Little Bridge Island Gazette called Cheers and Jeers, and the caption read: “Cheers to Sheriff’s Deputy Ryan Martinez, who sacrifices two hours from his busy schedule every week to give free ukulele lessons to the island’s younger population at the Mermaid Café. Join him every Wednesday night from six to eight. Open to the public.”  
  
  In the photo, Ryan was sitting on a table at the café, wearing a Cuban guayabera wedding shirt and a faded pair of chinos while holding a ukulele that looked ridiculously small against his enormous frame. He was surrounded by kids, all looking up at him enthusiastically, each holding a ukulele of their own.  
  
  “Oh my God,” I said, backing away from the desk. “I’m going to be sick.”  
  
  “Stop it.” Jenna was still smiling. “I think it’s sweet.”  
  
  “Exactly. Too sweet. There must be something wrong with him.”  
  
  “There is something wrong with him. You just told me he got busted for having almost tased an innocent civilian.”  
  
  “Yeah, and now this?”  
  
  “What’s wrong with this?” Jenna shook her head at the computer screen. “You’ve let Pete get into your head. You think everyone who does anything nice must have a secret dark side.”  
  
   
; “Because everyone does.”  
  
  “You don’t. I don’t. Javier doesn’t.” Javier was Jenna’s husband of twelve years.  
  
  “Yeah, well, most men do.”  
  
  “No, they don’t, Rob. Only some of them, just like only some women do. Promise me you’ll give this guy a chance.”  
  
  “Give him a chance how? I already let him be in my class, with, I might add, the mayor’s wife, despite the fact that for all we know he could be a raving psycho.”  
  
  “Not that kind of chance. Go to ukulele night.”  
  
  “What?” My voice cracked. “No way.”  
  
  “It says it’s open to the public.”  
  
  “Yeah, it also says there’ll be children there. You know how I feel about children. They’re sticky-fingered germ factories. Except yours, of course.”  
  
  “Rob, I know you like to act tough, but I also know that deep down inside, you’re a big softie who cries at weddings and is obsessed with rom-coms.”  
  
  “Ugh,” I said, and swung away from the desk to head for the water cooler. “I do not cry at weddings. And I should never have told you that thing about rom-coms. Now I have to kill you. Anyway, I teach yoga on Wednesday nights. You know that.”  
  
  “I’ll teach the class for you.”  
  
  “Oh, just like that, huh?”  
  
  “Just like that. In fact, if you go, I’ll teach every Wednesday yoga class for you for a month . . . but give you the money.”  
  
  I stared at her. “No way.”  
  
  “Way.”  
  
  “Oh, come on, Jen. Even if I did go to his stupid ukulele thing and things worked out, what would be the point? You know we can’t date clients.”  
  
  “He’s hardly a client, Rob. He’s taken one class.”  
  
  “It’s still unethical.”  
  
  “How? It’s not like you’re his personal trainer.”  
  
  I leaned down to fill my water bottle from the cooler. “I don’t think you heard the part where I said no way. Besides, he made a point of not mentioning to me what it is he does Wednesday nights. Patrick thought he was in AA.”  
  
  “Probably because unlike most of the guys we get in here, he didn’t want to brag about himself, which is a refreshing change. Why can’t you just go? What’s the worst that could happen?”  
  
  “Uh, I could fall in love with him and he could turn out to be a two-timing jerk who steals my stuff and breaks my heart?”  
  
  “Or he could turn out to be really sweet and you two could have a great time together.”  
  
  I switched off the water with a disgusted snort. “Please.”  
  
  “Good things do happen to people, Robbie.”  
  
  “In movies. Not to me.”  
  
  “Is this about your parents?”  
  
  I felt myself flush. And I do not flush. “Don’t drag them into this.”  
  
  “How can I not when I know they’re what this is about?”  
  
  “This is not about them.”  
  
  “Rob, you had parents who wouldn’t take care of themselves, which is how you ended up in a helping profession, then had a run of bad luck in the romance department—”  
  
  “You’re calling what Pete did to me bad luck?”  
  
  “Yes. But you, more than anyone, are due for a break, and maybe this guy is it. You’re never going to know if you don’t take a risk. That’s what all those women, and men, in that class you teach every year are doing—taking a risk on love. Why can’t you?”  
  
  I stared at her like she was crazy. “Are you talking about bridal boot camp?”  
  
  “Exactly. How come you’re so good at encouraging everyone else in the world to go for their goals except yourself?”  
  
  I stared at her some more, genuinely stunned. “Because . . . because . . .” I sputtered. “Because I know the truth—that there’s no such thing as happily ever after. That’s fiction. Look at my parents!”  
  
  “Look at me,” Jenna pointed out in a gentle voice. “And Javier.”  
  
  “Fine.” I folded my arms. “Except for you two.”  
  
  “And all those other couples who’ve been through your class.”  
  
  “Okay, right,” I admitted, reluctantly. “Maybe for them, too.”  
  
  “So why not,” she asked softly, “for you?”  
  
  I glared at her. “Because I’m just not that lucky.”  
  
  “Luck has nothing to do with it. You have to try to succeed, as you well know, and you won’t even try. You know, I’ll bet if you did, by next summer, when you do bridal boot camp again, you’ll be in it. Not running it, but as a bride-to-be.”  
  
  “Oh my God,” I said, rolling my eyes to disguise how uncomfortable she was making me. “Now I’m gonna puke.”  
  
  “Just go to ukulele night. Promise me!”  
  
  “Fine,” I snapped. “You’ll really take all of my Wednesday yoga classes if I do it? For a month?”  
  
  “All of them.”  
  
  “It’s a deal.” I headed for the door. “Your funeral. Good night, Jen.”  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  So that’s why when Wednesday night rolled around, I found myself at the Mermaid Café.  
  
  Not because of anything Jenna had said, of course. Only because I had nothing else to do at that particular moment, since she’d insisted—insisted—on teaching the Wednesday-night yoga class for me. For a month.  
  
  The fact that I’d flat-ironed my hair and paired a new sundress with my sexiest bra had nothing to do with anything she’d said, either.  
  
  Or so I told myself.  
  
  I heard not the faintest hint of ukulele music when I walked in . . . but I saw plenty of kids running around, giant grins on their faces, putting their sticky hands all over everything.  
  
  And I saw tons of the instruments lying around on the Mermaid’s many teal-colored Formica tables. A dockside diner (though by the plethora of mermaid Barbies hanging from the ceiling, many tourists mistook it for a dive bar and steered clear, which was fine by me), the Mermaid catered to a diverse clientele. I recognized most of the ones in attendance for ukulele night . . .  
  
  Including Ryan Martinez, who was looking sizzling hot in a white guayabera of paper-thin linen, through which I could see the faintest hint of crisply curling dark chest hair.  
  
  What was I doing here? I was dead meat.  
  
  I was listening to the warning bells going off in my head and turning on my heel to leave when I heard someone call out my name.  
  
  “Roberta!”  
  
  Crap. He’d spotted me.  
  
  I spun back around, trying to smile but feeling uncomfortable, not only because I’d spotted a number of my clients in the crowd, all of whom were watching my interaction with Ryan with intense interest, but also because I suspected his partner, Chrissie, might be there somewhere (he’d said they went almost everywhere together).  
  
  The problem was, I couldn’t figure out which one she could be. None of the women I saw appeared to be of the ubertall skinny blonde super cop variety. Most looked like ordinary moms, dressed for the hot weather in blousy tops and yoga pants, except for Bree, the pretty but sad-eyed little waitress who took my afternoon spin class every Tuesday and Thursday.  
  
  “Oh, hey,” I said, extending my right hand toward Ryan. “How’s it going? How funny to run into you like this—”  
  
  He looked down at my hand like it was something foreign. “What’s this?” he asked, and knocked my hand away with one of his big bear paws. “I thought we were friends. Friends don’t shake hands. Friends hug.”  
  
  And before I knew it, I was swept up into an embrace that was at once as careful not to crush me as it was emphatic that we were, indeed, friends. Friends? I had not come here to be friends. But that’s apparently what we were now.  
  
  When he thrust me away from him again, he said, with total sincerity, “You saved me.”  
  
  I blinked at him. “I what?”  
  
  “You saved me. You really did. Hey, guys.” He swung me around by my shoulders to face a group of young men, each as muscular as he was. “This is that trainer I was telling you about, Roberta.”  
  
  The guys all lowered their bottles of beer and looked at me with a degr  
ee of interest I decided to find flattering. My only other choice was to be completely freaked out by it, and I don’t freak out.  
  
  “Oh, cool,” one of them said. Another said, “Hi, Roberta.”  
  
  “Um,” I said. “Hi. But I really didn’t do anything—”  
  
  “Are you kidding?” Ryan was flabbergasted. And still holding my shoulders with one of those heart-meltingly masculine arms. “You have no idea how much better I’ve felt since your class. All the guys have seen a difference in me. Even Sheriff Hartwell noticed.”  
  
  “It’s true,” one of his friends said. “He hasn’t been nearly as much of an asshole.”  
  
  “He means Martinez, not Hartwell. Hartwell’s always an asshole,” another one of them joked.  
  
  “I really didn’t do anything,” I repeated, taken aback. “Ryan’s the one who did all the work.”  
  
  “Are you kidding?” Ryan said again, spinning me back toward him. “You taught me to breathe.”  
  
  I was about to repeat for a third time that this wasn’t true when I remembered that this was exactly what I’d assured him he’d learn in the class—how to lower his stress, and how to breathe. It was the unstated goal of bridal boot camp, though most people took it to lose weight.  
  
  “Oh,” I said. “Well, that’s great. Maybe I’ll see you there next week.”  
  
  “Damned right you will,” Ryan said. “We’re all going to be there. If that hurricane doesn’t head in this direction.” There was a hurricane brewing in the Atlantic that forecasters were giving a strong chance of heading toward Florida. “Won’t we, guys?”  
  
  The five guys in front of me nodded in unison, grinning. I was sure they were kidding . . . until I looked into their faces, and then I was sure they were not. They seemed as sincere as Ryan.  
  
  “Long as I don’t have to wear a wedding veil,” the tallest one said. He appeared to be the jokester of the group.  
You don’t,” I assured him. “Although can I just say you’d all look really good in white?

Drinks now cost more than dinners, and no one blinks. Today, alcohol and not‑alcohol blur together in menus that read like magic spells. The glass has become a statement piece, a ticket to be photographed, tagged, and believed. You don’t just drink anymore. You perform with the drink. Wrist tilted just enough with condensation on the stem and smoke curling slowly over ice, glowing under bar light. Garnishes glittering, hanging like ornaments built for Instagram rather than mouths.

The drink is bait. The drink is spectacle. The drink is how a place announces itself. The bar has become the stage, and each cocktail is a line in the script. Limes and syrups and powders imported from health fads, fashion weeks, reality shows, TikToks. Torches crackle behind the well. Dry ice clouds the table. Somewhere beneath the sugar, spice, matcha, CBD, or coffee, there’s still the same need: people searching for something to carry them a little further into the night. This is what is carrying people tonight:

**The Undisputed Champions: Top Best-Sellers That Rule Every Menu**

**Margaritas**

The margarita remains America's undisputed cocktail champion, leading searches in 26 out of 50 states. It isn't your basic lime-and-salt situation anymore. Spicy Margaritas are exploding on social media, with jalapeño and chili variations becoming the most viral cocktail trend of summer 2025. Restaurants report these fiery twists are driving both foot traffic and social media engagement.

**Old Fashioned**

Ranking as the second most searched cocktail, the Old Fashioned is experiencing a renaissance with innovative twists. Bars are introducing smoked variations and flavored syrups while maintaining the drink's classic appeal to traditional cocktail lovers.

**Espresso Martinis**

The espresso martini has become the third most popular cocktail nationwide, with some chain restaurants reporting an increase as much as 40% over last year. This caffeinated cocktail perfectly captures Gen Z's love for both coffee culture and nightlife, making it a must-have for any restaurant targeting younger demographics.

**Health-Conscious Revolution**

**Matcha Surges**

Matcha menu placement increased 21.6% from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025, with some chains reporting 50% year-over-year growth for matcha drinks.

**Functional Beverages**

The functional beverage market reached $9.2 billion with 54% growth from 2020-2024. Nearly 80% of consumers want restaurants to offer more functional beverages, and many are willing to pay premium prices for drinks that deliver health benefits. Popular options include:

· **Adaptogenic Beverages** with stress-relief properties

· **Kombucha Spritzers** for digestive health

· **CBD-Infused Mocktails** for relaxation

· **Nootropic Drinks** for cognitive enhancement

**Viral Drinks Driving Traffic**

**Dirty Sodas**

Thanks to reality TV and TikTok, dirty sodas have exploded nationwide. These customized sodas with flavored syrups, creams, and add-ins represent one of summer 2025's biggest surprises. These sodas are being served with or without alcohol. Chains like TGI Fridays have launched entire dirty soda menus. McDonald's is currently testing ""Dirty Sodas"" in 500 locations.

**Is It Instagram Worthy**

89% of diners research online before visiting a restaurant, making visual appeal crucial. Trending viral cocktails include:

· **Clarified Cocktails** with a crystal-clear appearance

· **Color-Changing Drinks** that transform when mixed

· **Smoke-Infused Presentations** for dramatic effect

· **Edible Glitter** and dramatic garnishes

**What's Hot Where**

The beverage landscape varies dramatically by region, with distinct preferences emerging across the United States:

· **West Coast**: Margaritas dominate, with strong interest in Matcha Drinks and Craft Cocktails

· **Northeast**: Martinis lead, especially Espresso and Wine-Based Cocktails

· **Midwest**: Old Fashioned Variations reign supreme alongside Craft Beer

· **South**: Margaritas and Sweet Tea Innovations drive sales

· **Southwest**: Spicy margaritas and Agave-Based Spirits lead trends

**The Non-Alcoholic Revolution: Sober-Curious Drives Innovation**

**Gen Z Leads the Charge**

65% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials plan to reduce alcohol consumption in 2025. This shift is creating massive opportunities for sophisticated non-alcoholic options:

· 40% of restaurants plan to expand non-alcoholic drink offerings in 2025

· Nonalcoholic Beverage sales soared 30% in 2024

· Venues generating $2 million annually saw average revenue boosts of $95,000 by expanding nonalcoholic menus

**Premium Mocktails Command Premium Prices**

A thoughtfully crafted $9 mocktail often surpasses the margins of a traditional $14 cocktail, making this category incredibly profitable for operators who execute it well.

**The Profitability Picture: What Makes Money**

Based on industry data, here's what's driving the most profit in restaurant beverage programs:

**Highest Margin Categories:**

· **Signature Cocktails**: 75-80% profit margins

· **Specialty Sodas**: 75-85% profit margins

· **Coffee Drinks**: 70-80% profit margins

· **Nonalcoholic Cocktails**: 70-75% profit margins

**Volume Leaders:**

· **Craft Beer**: 47% of pizzerias rate it 8+ out of 10

· **Wine**: 28% of operators report strong performance

· **Specialty Cocktails**: 20% report high sales performance

**Technology and Innovation Shaping the Future**

**Cold Brew and Coffee Innovation**

Cold Brew continues strong momentum, with younger consumers who grew up with cold coffee now coming of age. Operators are adding flavored cold brew options and upscale afternoon service to capture this growing market.

**What This Means for Restaurant Operators**

The beverage landscape in 2025 is being driven by several key factors:

1. **Social Media Influence**: Visual appeal and shareability drive customer acquisition

2. **Health Consciousness**: Functional benefits are becoming table stakes

3. **Demographic Shifts**: Gen Z's preferences are reshaping entire categories

4. **Profitability Focus**: Beverages offer higher margins than food in many cases

5. **Experience Economy**: Drinks are becoming part of the overall dining experience

**The Bottom Line**: Restaurants that embrace innovative beverages, prioritize visual appeal, offer functional benefits, and cater to health-conscious consumers are seeing significant revenue growth and customer loyalty improvements. The beverage game has never been more important or more profitable for restaurant success.

1mwgxhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1mwgxhw/suspected_mcas_family_has_a_documented_history/,Suspected MCAS - Family has a documented history with MCAS. Need Help!,"Hey everyone,

My world kind of flipped on July 3rd. I took my wife and daughter to Chipotle and ordered my usual double chicken burrito (white rice, spicy salsa, sour cream, cheese). They both ate chicken dishes with no issue, but a few hours later I was driving and suddenly felt like I might pass out. My feet got clammy, my stomach pain was unbearable, and my anxiety spiked. I had to pull into a gas station and call my wife to come get me.

For context: I’ve been on daily OTC Omeprazole for \~18 years since being diagnosed with acid reflux at 21. Looking back, I wonder if it’s just been masking MCAS this whole time.

That July 3rd flare knocked me down for almost two weeks. I was still drinking coffee and carbonated drinks during that time (bad call, I know), which probably slowed recovery. On July 17th, we flew to Chicago for 10 days with friends. I was doing great for the first 5–6 days (restaurants, beers, all the fun stuff). Then day 7 hit—flare again. Could’ve been the pizza, beer, or Portillo’s, but it knocked me right back.

Since then, I’ve basically locked myself into “food prison”: chicken, white rice, scrambled eggs, and water only. My first attempt at a “cheat meal” was a Chick-fil-A fried chicken sandwich with cheese… and boom, flare again.

I’ve already seen my PCP, and I’ve got upcoming appointments with an allergist and GI in late October. In the meantime, I’m hoping to hear from others who’ve been down this road—what helped you stabilize before you had a full treatment plan in place?

As stated in the title, my family has a history with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. My Sister and Mom have both been formally diagnosed with MCAS after a litany of testing they'd underwent about ten years ago.

**Current Medications/Supplements:**

* 10 mg generic Allegra daily (double during flares)
* 20 mg Pepcid AC Max Strength (double during flares)
* 20 mg Omeprazole daily
* 12.5 mg Promethazine as needed (new from PCP)
* 8 mg Zofran as needed (new from PCP)

**Weekly injections:**

* 10 mg Tirzepatide (since 2023, weight loss)
* 125 mg IM Testosterone (since 2023, medical)

**Supplements:**

* Digest Gold enzymes (1–2 with meals)
* Activated Charcoal (only right after a flare)
* Quercetin w/ Bromelain
* Magnesium Glycinate
* Zinc Carnosine
* Liposomal Vitamin C

I’d really appreciate any advice on:

1. Short-term strategies to avoid constant setbacks.
2. What foods others found “safe” early on.
3. Whether Omeprazole could be making things worse.

Thanks in advance for any guidance—just trying to figure out how to live without being in a constant cycle of flares and recovery.",2,1755796107.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False
1mwgxdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mwgxdb/ruckus_novel_by_lj_shen_free_read_online/,Ruckus Novel by L.J. Shen Free Read online,"Another fact I couldn’t argue with. Daddy said I was a magnet for the wrong kind of boys, but that was like sugarcoating a ball of dirt and rusty nails. I understood the underlying complaint he had made, I did, especially as I’d always been his little princess. Rosie-bug. The apple of his eye.  
  
  I was racy. It wasn’t intentional. It was even, at times, an inconvenient liability. With thick lashes, cascading caramel hair, long milky legs, and downy lips so full they took over most of my face. Everything else about me was small and ripe—wrapped in a red satin bow with a siren expression that seemed to have been permanently inked on my face, no matter how hard I tried to wipe it off.  
  
  I attracted attention. The best kind. The worst kind. Hell, every kind.  
  
  There were going to be other boys, I tried to convince myself when Dean and Emilia’s lips touched and my heart shriveled in my chest. But there was always going to be one Millie.  
  
  Besides, my sister deserved it. Deserved him. I had Mama and Daddy’s attention, all day, every day. I had plenty of friends at school, and admirers lining up outside our door. All eyes were on me, while no one spared my sister a second glance.  
  
  It wasn’t my fault, but that didn’t make me feel any less guilty. My older sister had become the product of both my illness and popularity. A solitary teenager hiding behind a canvas, obscured behind paint. Quiet all the time, sending her message through her weird, eccentric clothes.  
  
  When I think about it, it was really for the best. The first day I noticed Dean Cole in the hallway between trig and English period, I knew that he was more than just a high school crush. If I had him, I wouldn’t let go. And that in itself was a dangerous concept I couldn’t afford toying with.  
  
  See, my clock was ticking faster. I wasn’t born like the rest.  
  
  I had an illness.  
  
  Sometimes I conquered it.  
  
  Sometimes it conquered me.  
  
  Everyone’s favorite Rose was wilting, but no flower wants to die in front of an audience.  
  
  Besides, it was better that way, I decided when her lips were on his and his eyes were on mine and reality became a complex, agonizing thing I was desperate to run away from.  
  
  And so I watched as my sister and the only guy who made my heart beat faster fall in love from my front-row seat.  
  
  My petals falling one by one.  
  
  Because even though I knew my story wouldn’t end with a happily ever after, I couldn’t help but wonder…could it have a happy ending, even if just momentarily?  
  
  The summer when I turned seventeen was bad, but nothing prepared me for its fucking grand finale.  
  
  All arrows pointed to calamity. I couldn’t isolate what path would lead me to it, but knowing my life, I braced myself for a sucker punch that’d send me straight to hell.  
  
  In the end, it all boiled down to one, reckless, movie-cliché moment. A few Bud Lights and sloppily rolled blunts weeks before our junior year was over.  
  
  We were lying by Vicious’s kidney-shaped pool, drinking his dad’s flat beer, knowing we could get away with it—Christ, with fucking everything—under Baron Spencer Senior’s roof. There were girls. They were high. There weren’t many things to do in Todos Santos, California, on the verge of summer break. Everything was scorching hot. The air heavy, the sun bloated, the grass yellow, and the youth bored with their probl  
emless, meaningless existence. We were too lazy to chase cheap thrills, so we looked for them while we were leisurely sprawled on pool floats the shape of donuts and flamingos and Italian-imported sunbathing chair lounges.  
  
  Vicious’s parents weren’t home—were they ever?—and everyone was counting on me to supply. Never one to disappoint, I brought over sweet hash and some Molly, which they greedily inhaled without even thanking me, let alone paying me back. They figured I was a rich, stoner bastard who needed more money like Pamela Anderson needed more tits, which was partially true. And I never sweated the small stuff anyway, so I let it slide.  
  
  One of the girls, a blondie named Georgia, flaunted her new Polaroid camera, which her dad gave her on their latest Palm Springs vacation. She took pictures of us boys—Jaime, Vicious, Trent, and myself—flaunting her assets in a little red bikini and clasping the freshly printed pictures between her teeth, handing them to us, mouth-to-mouth. Her tits spilled out of her small bikini top like overflowing toothpaste from a tube. I wanted to rub my dick between them, and knew with certainty that I would, by the end of that day.  
  
  “My, my, this one’s going to be gooood.” Georgia used an indefinite amount of O’s for the last word for emphasis. “Looking uber-sexy, Cole,” she purred when she caught me on camera pounding the remainder of the beer with a blunt clasped between my fingers and slamming the can on my hard thigh.  
  
  Click.  
  
  The evidence of my wrongdoing slid out of her camera with a provocative hiss, and she plucked it with her glossy lips, bending down and handing it to me. I bit it and shoved it into my swim trunks. Her eyes followed my hand as I nudged the elastic downwards, revealing a straight line of light hair below my naval that invited her to the rest of the party. She swallowed. Visibly. Our eyes met, silently agreeing on a time and a place. Then someone cannonballed into the pool and splashed her, and she shook her head, chuckling breathlessly before skipping to her next art project, my best friend, Trent Rexroth.  
  
  Destroying the picture before I got home was always the plan. I blame the fucking Molly for forgetting. In the end, my mother found it. In the end, my father gave me one of his low-tone lectures that always seemed to eat my insides like arsenic. And in the very, very end? They made me spend my summer vacation with my fucking uncle, the one I really couldn’t stand.  
  
  I knew better than to fight them about it. The last thing I needed was to stir shit and jeopardize my Harvard stint a year before I graduated. I’ve worked hard for this future, for this life. It was splayed before me, in all of its rich, entitled, fucked-up, private jets, timeshare, annual Hamptons vacation glory. That’s the thing about life. When something good falls into your hands, you don’t only hang on to the fucker, you clutch it so hard it almost breaks.  
  
  Just another lesson that I learned way too late into life.  
  
  Anyway, that’s how I ended up flying to Alabama, burning two months on a fucking farm prior to my senior year.  
  
  Trent, Jaime, and Vicious spent their summer drinking, smoking, and fucking girls on their home field. Me, I came back with a shiner, generously gifted to me by Mr. Donald Whittaker, AKA Owl, after the night that had changed who I was forever.  
  
  “Life is like justice,” Eli Cole, my lawyer-slash-dad, had said to me before I boarded the plane to Birmingham. “It’s not always fair.”  
  
  Wasn’t that the fucking truth.  
  
  That summer, I was forced to read the Bible cover to cover. Owl told my parents he was a born-again Christian and big on bible studies. He backed it up by making me read it with him during our lunch breaks. Ham on rye and the Old Testament were his version of not being a dickface, because he was pretty much horrible to me the rest of the time.  
  
  Whittaker was a farmhand. When he was sober enough to be anything, that was. He made me his barn boy. I agreed, mainly because I got to finger his neighbor’s daughter at the end of every day.  
  
  The neighbor’s daughter thought I was some kind of a celebrity just because I didn’t have a Southern accent and owned a car. I wasn’t one to crush her fantasy, especially as she was eager to be my sex ed student.  
  
  I humored Owl when he taught me the Bible, because the alternative was brawling with him in the hay until one of us passed out. I think my folks wanted me to remember that life wasn’t all about expensive cars and ski vacations. Owl and his wife were like Low Income Life 101. So, every morning I woke up asking myself what’s two months in comparison to my whole fucking life.  
  
  There were a lot of crazy-ass stories in the Bible; incest, foreskin-collection, Jacob wrestling an angel—I swear this book jumped the shark by the second chapter or so—but one story really stuck with me, even before I’d met Rosie LeBlanc.  
  
  Genesis 27. Jacob came to live with Laban, his uncle, and fell in love with Rachel, the younger of Laban’s two daughters. Rachel was hot as fuck, fierce, graceful, and pretty much sex on a stick (as indicated in the Bible, though not in so many words.)  
  
  Laban and Jacob struck a deal. Jacob was to work for Laban for seven years—then he could marry his daughter.  
  
  Jacob did as he was told—busting his ass under the sun, day in and day out. After those seven years, Laban finally came to Jacob and told him he could marry his daughter.  
  
  But here was the catch: it’s not Rachel’s hand he had given him. It was her older sister’s, Leah.  
  
  Leah was a good woman. Jacob knew that.  
  
  She was nice. Sensible. Charitable. Cute ass and soft eyes (again, paraphrasing here. Other than the eyes part. That shit was actually in the Bible.)  
  
  She was no Rachel, though.  
  
  She was no Rachel, and he wanted Rachel. It was. Always. Fucking. Rachel.  
  
  Jacob argued, fought, and tried to talk some sense into his uncle, but in the end, he’d lost. Life was like justice, even back then. It was anything but fair.  
  
  “Seven more years of work,” Laban promised. “And I’d let you marry Rachel, too.”  
  
  So, Jacob waited.  
  
  And lurked.  
  
  And yearned.  
  
  Which, anyone with half a brain should know, only gratifies your desperation for your subject of obsession.  
  
  Years ticked by. Slowly. Painfully. Numbly.  
  
  In the meantime, he was with Leah.  
  
  He didn’t suffer. Not per se. Leah was good to him. A safe bet. She could bear his children—something Rachel, he would later find out—had difficulty doing.  
  
  He knew what he wanted, and it may have looked like her, and may have smelled like her, and fuck—maybe even felt like her—but it was not her.  
  
  It took him fourteen years, but in the end, Jacob won Rachel fair and square.  
  
  Rachel might not have been blessed by God. Leah was. But here was the thing.  
  
  Rachel didn’t need to be blessed.  
  
  She was loved.  
  
  And unlike justice and life, love is fair.  
  
  What’s more? Eventually, love was enough.  
  
  Eventually, it was fucking everything.  
  
  Seven weeks into my senior year, another looming calamity had decided to blow up in my face in spectacular fashion. Her name was Rosie LeBlanc, and she had eyes like two frosted-over lakes in an Alaskan winter. That kind of blue.  
  
  The what-the-fuck moment grabbed me by the balls and twisted hard the second she opened the door to the servants’ house on Vicious’s lot. Because she wasn’t Millie. She looked like Millie—kind of—only smaller, shorter, with fuller lips, higher cheekbones, and the little pointy ears of a mischievous pixie. But she didn’t wear anything overtly weird like Emilia. A pair of sea-starred flip-flops on her feet, black skinny jeans cut wide at the knees, and a tattered black hoodie with a name of a band I didn’t know plastered in white. Designed to blend in, but, as I’d later find out, destined to shine like a motherfucking lighthouse.  
  
  Inferno-red hit her cheeks and crawled down the edge of her collar when our eyes tangled, and that told me everything I needed to know. She was new to me, but I was a familiar face. A face she studied, knew and stared at. All the fucking time.  
  
  “  
Are we engaged in a secret staring competition?” Her recovery was immediate. There was something in the rasp of her voice that almost sounded unnatural. Too small. Too hoarse. Too uniquely her. “Because it’s been twenty-three seconds since I opened the door and you haven’t introduced yourself yet. Also, you blinked twice.”  
  
  I originally came there to ask Emilia LeBlanc on a date, cornering her like a frightened animal with nowhere else to go. She wouldn’t give me her phone number. A hunter by nature, I was adequately patient to wait until she was close enough for me to pounce on, but it didn’t hurt to check on my prey every once in a while. If we were being honest, though, pursuing Emilia wasn’t really about Emilia. The thrill of the chase always made my balls tingle, and to me, she provided a challenge other chicks hadn’t supplied. She was new meat, and I was an insatiable carnivore. But I wasn’t expecting to find this.  
  
  This changed fucking everything.  
  
  I stood there like a mute and flashed my come-hither smirk, taunting the shit out of her, because on some level, she taunted the shit out of me. And it occurred to me that at that particular moment, maybe I wasn’t the hunter. Maybe, for a split, flashing second, I was Elmer Fudd with an out-of-bullets gun in the woods who just spotted an angry tigress.  
  
  “Can it even talk?” The tigress’s light eyebrows pulled together, and she leaned forward, poking me in the chest with her little claw. She called me it.  
  
  Ridiculing me. Undermining me. Fucking with me.  
  
  Wearing my best, innocent expression (that shit was hard to begin with. I forgot what innocence was before my umbilical cord was thrown into the trash), I clamped my teeth beneath my lips and shook my head no.  
  
  “You can’t talk?” She folded her arms and leaned against her doorframe, arching a skeptical brow.  
  
  I nodded yes, biting down a huge smile.  
  
  “That’s bullshit. I saw you at school. Dean Cole. They call you Ruckus. Not only can you talk, but most of the time, you can’t seem to shut up.

Fuck yeah, little pixie. Bottle that rage and save it for when I roll you between my sheets.  
  
  To understand my level of surprise, you first have to know that no girl has ever talked to me like this before. Not even Millie, and Millie seemed to be the only female student who was immune to my all-American, hot-jock, tear-your-panties-with-my-teeth charm. Hell, that’s why I noticed her in the first place.  
  
  But as I said, plans change. It’s not like we’d dated yet. I sniffed Millie’s tail around school for a few weeks, debating whether she was worth pursuing, but now that I saw what I’d missed—this little firecracker—it was time to find warmth in her crazy flames.  
  
  I unleashed another dirty smirk. This particular one landed me the nickname Ruckus in All Saints’s hallways two years ago. Because I was. I was fucking chaos, brewing anarchy everywhere I went. Everyone knew that. Teachers, students, Principal Followhill, and even the local sheriff.  
  
  When you needed drugs—you came to me. When you needed a good party—you came to me. When you needed an amazing fuck, you came to me—and on me. And this was what my smirk—the one I’d been practicing since I was fucking five—said to the world.  
  
  If it’s corrupted and dirty and fun—I’m all over it.  
  
  And this girl? She looked like a whole lotta fun to corrupt.  
  
  Her eyes traced my lips. Heavy. Wanting. Drunk. It was easy to read them. High school girls. Though this particular one didn’t smile as wide as the rest. She didn’t offer a silent invitation for flirtation either.  
  
  “You speak,” she coughed her words accusingly. I sucked my lower lip and released it. Slow. Calculated. Teasing.  
  
  “Maybe I do know a few words after all.” I got in her face on a hiss. “Wanna hear the interesting ones?” My eyes begged for me to slide down her body, but my brain told me to wait it out. I decided to listen to the latter.  
  
  I was relaxed.  
  
  I was cunning.  
  
  But for the first time in years, I had no idea what the fuck I was doing.  
  
  She gave me a lopsided grin that rendered me speechless. Shoving so many words into one, single expression. Telling me that my attempt to butter her up left her sorely unimpressed. That she liked me—yes—and noticed me—sure—but that I was going to have to do better than casual, half-assed flirting to get there. Wherever it was, I was ready for the journey.  
  
  “Do I really?” She dallied, not even noticing as she did. I dipped my chin down, leaning forward. I was big, commanding, and confident. And I was trouble. She probably heard all about it, but if not, she was about to find that out.  
  
  “I think you do,” I said.  
  
  Two minutes ago, I was determined to ask her sister out—older sister, I bet, this chick looked younger and besides, I would have known if she was a senior—and lookie here, fate made her open the door and change my plans.  
  
  Baby LeBlanc sent me an odd look, challenging me to continue. Just as I opened my mouth, Millie galloped into my vision, sprinting toward the door from the small, stuffy living room like she was fleeing a war zone. She was clutching a textbook to her chest, her eyes puffy and red. She was staring straight at me, and for a second, I thought she was going to smack me across the face with the five-pound textbook.  
  
  In retrospect, I wish she had. It would have been far better than what she actually did.  
  
  Millie pushed the little pixie aside without even realizing that she was there, threw herself onto my chest—uncharacteristically affectionate—and pressed her lips to mine like a possessed demon.  
  
  Fuck.  
  
  This was bad.  
  
  Not the kiss. The kiss was fine, I guess. I didn’t have time to process it, because my eyes widened, darting to the spear-eared elf who looked horrified, her cornflower-blues staring, processing, and boxing the three of us into something I wasn’t ready to accept.  
  
  What the hell was Millie doing? A few hours ago she was still pretending not to notice me in the hallway, buying time, seeking space, faking indifference. Now she was all over me like a rash after a dodgy one-night stand.  
  
  Gently, I pulled away from Millie and cupped her cheeks so she wouldn’t feel rejected, still making sure we had enough space to fit the little pixie between us. Emilia’s proximity was unwelcome, and that was a fucking first when it came to a hot chick.  
  
  “Hey,” I said. The body of my voice lost its usual playful tilt, even to my own ears. This wasn’t like Millie. Something happened, and I had a general idea who caused this little scene. My blood boiled. I breathed through my nostrils, determined not to lose my shit. “What’s up, Mil?”  
  
  The emptiness in her eyes made me nauseous. I could almost hear the sound of her heart cracking inside her fucking chest. I chanced another glance at Baby LeBlanc, wondering how the hell I was supposed to walk out of this one. She took a step back, her eyes lingering on the hot mess express that was still trying to hug me. Millie was distraught. I couldn’t deny her. Not then.  
  
  “Vicious,” the older sister said through a loud sniff. “Vicious happened.”  
  
  Then she pointed at the calculus textbook like it was evidence.  
  
  Reluctantly, my gaze drifted back to Emilia ‘Millie’ LeBlanc.  
  
  “What’d the asswipe do?” I snatched it from her hand and thumbed through the pages, looking for nasty comments or offensive drawings.  
  
  “He broke into my locker and stole it,” she snuffled again. “Before stuffing said locker with condom wrappers and garbage.” She wiped her nose with the back of her sleeve.  
  
  Jesus fucking Christ with this idiot. That was the other reason why I wanted to date Millie. The need to protect the strays burned in me from a young age. A soft spot and all that bullshit. I wasn’t all bad, like Vicious, neither was I all good, like Jaime. I had my own moral code, and bullying was a long, red line, drawn in blood.  
  
  See, as far as strays go, Millie was the perfect, shivering-in-the-rain fleabag in need of shelter. Terrorized at school and haunted by one of my best friends. I needed to do the right thing. I needed to, but fuck if I wanted to.  
  
  “I’ll take care of him.” I tried not to snap. “Go back inside.”  
  
  And leave me with your sister.  
  
  “You don’t need to, really. I’m just glad you’re here.”  
  
  I stole a glimpse at the girl who was destined to be the Rachel to my Jacob, this time longingly, because I knew I stood no chance with her the minute her sister kissed me to get back at fucking Vicious.  
  
  “I thought about it.” Millie blinked fast, too caught up in her own mess to realize I had barely spared her a glance since she appeared at the door. Too busy to notice her sister was right fucking there beside us. “And I decided—why not? I’d love to date you, actually.”  
  
  No, she wouldn’t. What she wanted was for me to be her shield.  
  
  Millie needed saving.  
  
  And I needed to smoke a fucking blunt.  
  
  I sighed, pulling the older sister into a hug, cupping the back of her head, the light-brown wisps of hair entwining between my fingers. My eyes still zoomed at Baby LeBlanc. At my little Rachel.  
  
  I’m going to make it right, my gaze promised her. It was clearly more optimistic than I was.  
  
  “You don’t have to date me. I can make life easier for you, as your friend. Say the word and I’ll kick his ass,” I whispered into Millie’s perfectly curved ear, my pupils honing in on her sister.  
  
  She shook her head, burying it deeper into my shoulder. “No, Dean. I want to date you. You’re nice and fun and compassionate.”  
  
  And completely in awe of your sister.  
  
  “Doubt it, Millie. You’ve been shutting me down for weeks. This is about Vic, and we both know it. Drink a glass of water. Rethink. I’ll talk to him tomorrow morning at practice.”  
  
  “Please, Dean.” Her wobbly voice steadied as she balled the fabric of my designer tee in her fists, pulling me closer to her and away from my new, shiny fantasy at the same time. “I’m a big girl. I know what I’m doing. Let’s go right now.”  
  
  “Yeah. Go.” I heard Baby LeBlanc rasp,  
waving her hand in our direction. “I need to study anyway, and you guys are a distraction. I’ll drown Vicious’s ass if I see him in the pool, Millie,” she joked, pretending to flex her skinny arms.  
  
  Baby LeBlanc was a shitty student, with C minuses for miles, but I didn’t know it back then. She didn’t want to study. She wanted her sister to be saved.  
  
  I took Millie for an ice cream, this time not looking back.  
  
  I took Millie when I should have taken Rosie.  
  
  I took Millie, and I was going to kill Vicious.  
  
  Present  
  
  What makes you feel alive?  
  
  Condensation. For it reminds me that I still breathe.  
  
  I MEAN, I GUESS THIS is classified as talking to myself, but I’d always been this way.  
  
  The voice that always asked the elusive question seemed to have been implanted in my brain, and it wasn’t me. It was a man’s voice. No one familiar, I don’t think. He always made me remember that I still breathed, which wasn’t necessarily something I took for granted. This time, my answer floated in my head like a bubble that was about to burst. I pressed my nose to the mirror in the elevator of the glitzy skyscraper that I lived in and blew air from my mouth, creating a thick cloud of white mist. I pulled away, staring at my doings.  
  
  The fact that I was still breathing was a huge screw-you to my illness.  
  
  Cystic Fibrosis. I always tried to get all the details out of the way when someone asked. All people needed to know was that I was diagnosed with it at the age of three when my sister, Millie, licked my face and said I tasted “really salty.” It was a red flag, so my parents had me checked. The results came back positive. It’s a lung disease. Yes, it is treatable. No, there’s no cure for it. Yes, it affects my life immensely. I’m constantly on pills, have three physiotherapy sessions a week, an indefinite amount of nebulizers, and I will probably die in the next fifteen years. No, I don’t need your pity, so don’t give me that look.  
  
  Still clad in my green scrubs, my hair a tangled mess, and my eyes glassy with lack of sleep, I inwardly prayed that the elevator would finally close and carry me to my apartment on the tenth floor. I wanted to undress, dip into a hot bath, and lie in bed, binge-watching Portlandia. And I wanted not to think about my ex-boyfriend, Darren.  
  
  Actually, I really wanted not to think about him.  
  
  Violent clicks of street-corner high heels echoed in my ears, seemingly out of nowhere, growing louder by the second. I twisted my head to the lobby and stifled a cough. The elevator’s door had already started to slide shut, but a feminine hand with red-hot fingernails slipped through the crack at the very last second, pushing it open with a high-pitched laugh.  
  
  I frowned.  
  
  Not him again.  
  
  But sure enough, it was him. He barged into the elevator, reeking of alcohol that I suspected would intoxicate a mature elephant to the point of death, armed with two women of the Desperate Housewives variety. The first one was the genius who compromised her arm to catch the elevator—a chick with velvet-red Jessica Rabbit hair and cleavage that left nothing to the imagination, even if you were extremely resourceful. The second was a petite brunette with the roundest ass I’ve ever seen on a human being and a dress so short, you could probably perform a gynecological exam on her without having to remove any clothing.  
  
  Oh, and then there was Dean ‘Ruckus’ Cole.  
  
  Tall—perfect size for a movie star—with moss-green eyes, almost radioactive in their sparkle and bottomless in their depth, disheveled, deep brown sex hair, and a body that would put Brock O’Hurn to shame. Sinfully sexy to the point you really had no choice but to look away and pray your underwear was thick enough to absorb your arousal. Seriously, the man was so outrageously hot, he was probably outlawed in ultra-religious countries. Luckily for me, I just so happened to know Mr. Cole was a world-class jerk, so I was mostly immune to his charm.  
  
  Mostly being the operative word here.  
  
  He was beautiful, but he was also a mess of epic proportions. You know those women who want the fucked-up, gorgeous, vulnerable guy they could fix and nurture? Dean Cole would be their wet dream. Because there definitely was something up with this guy. The notion that people in his immediate environment didn’t see the flashing neon warnings—his drinking, excessive pot-smoking, and raging addiction to everything sinful and fun—saddened me. Yet, I recognized that Dean Cole wasn’t my business. Besides, I had my own problems to deal with.  
  
  The HotHole hiccupped, punched the button to his penthouse five hundred times, and swayed in the small space the four of us shared. His eyes were feverish, and he wore a thin coat of sweat on his skin that smelled like pure brandy. A thick, rust-eaten wire twisted around my heart.  
  
  His smile didn’t look happy.  
  
  “Baby LeBlanc.” Dean’s lazy tone slipped right into my lower belly, and I stilled. He grabbed me by the shoulder, spinning me in place so that I faced him. His companions eyed me like I was a pile of rotten eggs. I placed my palms on his iron-steel chest, pushing him away.  
  
  “Careful. You smell like Jack Daniel’s just came in your mouth,” I deadpanned. He threw his head back and laughed—this time sporting an honest smile—thoroughly enjoying our bizarre exchange.  
  
  “This girl.” He wrapped an arm around my shoulder and squeezed me to his chest. He pointed at me with a hand that held onto the neck of a beer bottle, looking at the girls with a dazed grin. “Is fuck-hot and has brains and wit that would eclipse Winston Churchill in his finest hour,” he gushed. They probably thought Winston Churchill was a Cartoon Network character. Dean turned to face me, his brows dropping low all of a sudden. “That puts her in a high risk to be a condescending bitch, but she isn’t. She’s also fucking kind. That’s why she’s a nurse. Hiding that fine ass under scrubs is a crime, LeBlanc.”  
  
  “Sorry to disappoint, Officer Pothead, but I’m just volunteering. I’m actually a barista,” I corrected, ironing my scrubs with my hand as I wormed out of his touch, offering a polite smile to the girls. I volunteered at a NICU three times a week, monitoring incubators and cleaning baby poop. I wasn’t as artistically talented as Millie or as lucky as the HotHoles, but I had my passions—people and music—and I didn’t think any less of my aspirations than what they did for a living. Dean had an MBA from Harvard and a New York Times subscription, but was he really better than me? Hell, no. I worked in a small coffee shop called The Black Hole between First Ave and Ave A. The money was bad, but the company good. I figured life was too short to do something I wasn’t passionate about. Especially for me.  
  
  Jessica Rabbit rolled her eyes. The petite brunette hitched one bare shoulder and turned her back to us, messing with her phone. They thought I was a salty bitch. They were right. I literally was. But if we were being literal here, they were in for a rude awakening. I knew my neighbor and my sister’s ex-boyfriend’s ritual by heart. In the morning, he’ll call them a taxi and won’t even bother to pretend he saved their numbers.  
  
  In the morning, he’ll act like they were nothing but a mess he had to clean. In the morning, he will be sober, hungover, and ungrateful.  
  
  Because he was a HotHole.  
  
  A privileged, unhinged, egomaniac from Todos Santos who thought he deserved everything and owed nothing.  
  
  Come on, elevator. What’s taking you so long?  
  
  “LeBlanc,” Dean barked this time, leaning against the silver wall and pulling a joint from behind his ear, fishing for his lighter in his tailored, dark jeans. The bottle was discarded and passed to one of the women. He wore a designer V-neck tee—the kind of lime green that made his eyes pop and skin look even more tan—an open black blazer and high-top sneakers. He made me want stupid things. Things I never wanted from anyone, much less from a man who dated my sister for eight months. So I bottled them up and tried to be mean to him. Dean was like Batman. He was strong enough to take it.  
  
  “Tomorrow. You. Me. Sunday Brunch. Say the word, and I’ll be eating more than just food.” He dipped his chin down to exhibit his emerald eyes, a sinister expression  
on his face. No question marks with this guy. Brat, the bitter thought crossed my mind. He is going to have a threesome in a few minutes, and he’s standing here hitting on his ex-girlfriend’s sister. They can hear everything, too. Why are they still here?  
  
  I ignored his less-than-stellar advance on me, warning him about something else entirely. “If you light that thing in the elevator,” I pointed at his blunt, “I swear I will sneak into your apartment tonight and pour hot wax all over your groin.”  
  
  Jessica Rabbit gasped. Petite Brunette shrieked. Well, they would be in the fire line if that happened.  
  
  “Geez, get some chill.” The brunette waved a hand at me, ready to explode. “Like, creepy much?”  
  
  I paid no attention to the woman with the crayon makeup. Instead, I simply stared at the red numbers above the elevator’s door, indicating that I was getting closer and closer to a bath, wine, and Portlandia.  
  
  “Answer me.” Dean ignored the girls he was about to pork, returning his glazy eyes to mine. “Brunch?” Hiccup. “Or we can just skip the whole thing and fuck?”  
  
  Hopeless romantic, I know, but sadly, it was still a no for me.  
  
  In all honesty, I wasn’t just turned off by how he tried to drag me into his bed, but also by his poor timing. It had been three weeks since Darren packed his things and moved out of the apartment we had shared for six months—we had been together for nine months, after a short stint I had with a greasy monkey, metal music enthusiast named Hal. Dean hadn’t wasted any time trying to accommodate the casual rebound position. The fact that Dean was essentially my landlord and that I only paid him a hundred bucks a month for legal reasons didn’t make it easier to reject him. He co-owned my apartment with Vicious, Jaime, and Trent, and while I knew he wouldn’t kick me out—Vicious would never let him—I also knew I had to play nice with him.  
  
  But the notion that he could possibly give me every STD listed on WebMD did make it easier to turn him down. A lot easier, actually.  
  
  The red numbers crept up on the display.

They are plugged into school/work communities and seem to be thriving. I am so stoked to see them enjoying this city, and I would love to find ways to live this city and its people more.

Things I really do love about Austin:

• The coffee, food, and art here are great!

• The hours places are open—It’s so nice to not have to wait for a place to open or rush to get out of a place before they close!

• Hiking on Lady Bird Lake

• A few skate parks to observe

• Great access to music and film

However, since moving here, I have struggled with a few communal things specifically:

I’ve struggled to find a deep creative/artist/entrepreneurial community where the pursuit and interest is mutual—not mostly me begging/paying to be part of something.

I’ve struggled to find a group of folks who regularly hike/swim/workout that I could jump in with. I want to be more healthy, but I struggle to find folks who want to join me in regular physical activities.

And kind of related, I’ve struggled with how car-dependent this city is—especially as someone who lives more on the north/east side of town. You’d think that growing up in The Greater Houston Area, I’d be used to how hard it is to connect with folks locally. 🤣 

I got kind of spoiled living in the UK and on the West Coast for brief stints where walkability, love of outdoors, and ease of finding community was strong, and I guess I’m hoping I can find things/people that can help me more enjoy living in the city that has become home after this past decade.

Thanks for reading!

She just ended her 7 year relationship.
I was engaging with her via DM’s online. At one point, she gave me her phone number and agreed to plan a day to meet up in person.

The next morning I texted her and was trying to plan a day to meet up for coffee or dinner.
She responded back and said she is busy and doesn’t know when she will have time to meet up.

This Taurus Woman since then hasn’t been very engaging with text messages. What did I do wrong? Did she change her mind?

  Raffles, discount coupons, and magazine sweepstakes lay strewn across the kitchen table. My stepmom sits straight-backed in one of the creaky wooden chairs, delicately cutting out another coupon, dyed blonde hair piled on top of her head in perfect ringlets, lipstick the color of men’s heartblood. Her white blouse is spotless, her dark pencil skirt neatly ironed. She must have a meeting with a potential client today.  
  
  “Sweetie, a little faster this morning.” She snaps her fingers for me to hurry up.  
  
  I shuffle over to the counter and pry open the coffee tin. The smell is strong and cheap—the only kind I was raised on. Which is all the better, seeing as we can’t afford expensive coffee, although I know that never stops the stepmonster from ordering her double-shot dirty chai soy latte no whip every morning and charging it to one of her dozens of credit cards.  
  
  Catherine—my stepmom—picks up another magazine to cut. “No carbs this morning. I’m feeling bloated and I have a meeting with a couple this afternoon. Big wedding plans. She’s a debutante, if you could believe that!”  
  
  In Charleston? I can believe it. Everyone’s either a debutante, a Daughter of the Confederacy, or a politician’s kid—Thornhill or Fishburne or Van Noy or Pickney or a handful of old Charlestonian names. And I couldn’t care less.  
  
  I dump two scoops of coffee into the machine—plus an extra one for good measure. It feels like a three-scoop kind of day. Maybe adding more caffeine to their morning will get my stepmother and the twins out before nine. That’s not too much to wish for, is it?  
  
  I glance up at the clock on the microwave. 8:24 a.m. Unless the twins start moving at warp speed, I’ll be cutting it real close. I say a silent prayer to the Lord of Light or Q or whoever is listening: Please, for once, let the stepmonster and the twins leave the house on time. Starfield history will be made today at 9 a.m. sharp on Hello, America, and I won’t miss it. I refuse. Finally, after years of delays and director changes and distribution snafus, the movie is happening—a reboot, but beggars can’t be choosers—and today they’re making the long-awaited announcement of the official film platform. The lead actors, the plot, everything. I’ve missed Starfield marathons and midnight rereleases of the final episode in theaters and convention appearances because of Catherine and the twins, but I’m not missing this.  
  
  “They want to say their vows under the magnolia trees at Boone Hall Plantation,” Catherine goes on. “You know, ever since Ryan Reynolds and his wife got married there, that place is always booked.”  
  
  Catherine is a wedding planner. I’ve watched her spend entire weekends hand-sewing sequins onto table toppers and hand-pressing invitations at the print shop downtown. The way she plans a venue, down to the type of cloth on the tables and the color of flowers in the vases, making every wedding look like a magical land of unicorns. You’d think she does it because of her own happily-ever-after cut short, but that’s a lie. She wants her weddings in Vogue and InStyle, the kind you Instagram and Pinterest a hundred times over. She wants the renown of it, and she’s sunk all of Dad’s life insurance payout into her business. Well, her business and everything she claims is “essential” to her “image.”  
  
  “I want to at least look like I shop at Tiffany’s,” she says, talking more to herself than to me.  
  
  It’s the same spiel again and again. How she used to shop at Tiffany’s. How she used to attend galas at Boone Hall Plantation. How she used to be happily married with two wonderful daughters. She never mentions me, her stepdaughter.  
  
  Catherine finishes cutting her coupon with a sigh. “But that was all before. Before your father left me and the twins here in this dreadful little house.”  
  
  And there it is. Like it’s my fault that she’s blown all her savings. Like it’s Dad’s fault. I take out Dad’s Starfield mug—the only thing left of his in our house—and pour myself a cup of coffee.  
  
  Outside, the neighbor’s dog begins to bark at a passing track-suited jogger. We live on the outskirts of the famous historical district, the house not quite old enough to be a tourist attraction but not new enough to be renovated—not that we could afford it anyway. Two streets over and you run into the College of Charleston. Our house was one of the last ones left after Hurricane Hugo decimated the coast of South Carolina before I was born. The house has its leaks, but all good and old things do. I’ve lived here my whole life. I don’t know anything else.  
  
  Catherine absolutely hates it.  
  
  The coffee smell is rich and nutty. I take a sip, and I almost melt. It’s heaven. Catherine clears her throat, and I pour coffee into her favorite mug: white with pink flowers. Two sugars (the only sweetness she splurges on each day), lightly stirred, with three ice cubes.  
  
  She takes it without even looking up from her magazine. And then, when the neighbor dog lets out a sharp howl, she sets down her cup. “You would think dogs would learn when to shut up. Giorgio has enough on his plate without that dog barking.”  
  
  Catherine likes to pretend she’s on a first-name basis with everyone, but especially people she deems important. Mr. Ramirez—Giorgio—is a banker, which means he has a lot of money, which means he’s an influential part of the country club, which means he’s important.  
  
  “If it doesn’t shut up soon,” she goes on in that cool, detached  
voice of hers, “I’ll muzzle it myself.”  
  
  “His name’s Franco,” I remind her. “And he doesn’t like being tied up.”  
  
  “Well, we all must get used to disappointment,” she replies, and takes another sip of coffee. Her blood-colored lips turn into a scowl and she shoves the mug back at me. “Too bitter. Try again.”  
  
  Begrudgingly, I put in another cube of ice to water it down. She takes the coffee and tries another sip. It must be sufficiently soulless, because she sets it down beside her stack of coupons and goes back to scanning the gossip column in her magazine.  
  
  “Well?” She prods.  
  
  I hesitate, looking from her coffee to her, wondering if I’ve forgotten something. I’ve been doing this for seven years—I don’t think I’m missing anything.  
  
  Outside, the dog gives a pitiful howl. Oh.  
  
  She raises a pencil-thin eyebrow. “How am I supposed to have a calm morning with that racket?” she goes on in that overworked, all-knowing voice of hers. “If Robin was still here…”  
  
  I glance back at her. Open my mouth. Begin to say that I miss Dad too. I want him here too—but something stops me. Or I stop myself. I blame it on the lack of coffee. One sip doesn’t give you the insta-courage a cup does. Besides, I’m not trying to make Catherine mad. I’m trying to get her caffeinated, placated, and out the door.  
  
  She flips the page in her magazine and picks up the scissors again to cut out a coupon for a winter coat. It’s June. In South Carolina.  
  
  But then Catherine clears her throat. “Danielle, do something to get that mutt to quiet down.”  
  
  “But—”  
  
  “Now,” Catherine says, flicking her hand for me to hurry up.  
  
  “Sure, my queen,” I mutter under my breath. While Catherine puts down her coupons and picks up an article about Jessica Stone’s latest red carpet look, I slip last night’s steak tips out of the fridge and hurry through the back door.  
  
  Poor Franco sits in the mud outside of his doghouse, thumping his tail in a puddle. He looks at me through the broken slat in the fence, a muddy brown Dachshund in a dirty red collar. It rained last night and his doghouse flooded, just like I told Mr. Ramirez—sorry, Giorgio—it would.  
  
  Mr. Ramirez brought Franco home a few weeks after he married his second ex-wife, I guess as a dry run for having a kid. But since his divorce a few years ago, he pretty much lives at work, so Franco is this forgotten idea that never panned out, with the flooded doghouse to prove it. At least the poor Frank can float.  
  
  I slide the container through the slat and rub the dog behind the ears, slathering my fingertips in mud. “You’re a good boy, yes you are! Once I save up enough, I’ll spring the both of us out of here. Whatcha think of that, copilot?” His tail pat-pats excitedly in the mud. “I’ll even get us matching sunglasses. The whole nine yards.”  
  
  Franco’s tongue lolls out of the side of his mouth in agreement. Maybe they don’t even make doggy sunglasses, but for a while I’ve had this picture in my head: me and Franco crammed into a beat-up car, heading out on the only highway out of town—wearing sunglasses, of course—and headed straight for L.A.  
  
  Ever since I can remember, my fingers have itched to make things. To write. I have filled journals, finished fanfics, escaped again and again into the pages of someone else’s life. If Dad was right—if I could do anything, be anyone—I would make a show like Starfield and tell other weird kids that they aren’t alone. And after next year—my senior year—I’m going to do it. Or start to. Study screenwriting. Write scripts. I’ve already got a portfolio, kind of. Right now I satisfy my need to write by blogging on my site Rebelgunner, where I cover the one thing I know for certain: Starfield. That and the money I’m scraping together from my job at the food truck are gonna be my ticket out of here. One day.  
  
  “Danielle!” my stepmom screeches from the kitchen window.  
  
  I push the steak tips under the fence and Franco dives headfirst into the bowl.  
  
  “Maybe in another universe, boy,” I whisper. “Because for now, my home is here.”  
  
  This place is too full of memories to leave, even if I wanted to. Dad technically left the house to me, but Catherine’s in charge of it while I’m still a minor. So until then—  
  
  “Danielle!”  
  
  Until then I’m here with my stepmother and her daughters.  
  
  “All right! Coming!” With one last scratch behind Frank’s ear, I say goodbye, make a mental note to return later for the dish, and dart back to the kitchen.  
  
  “Girls!” Catherine calls again, slinging a Gucci purse over her shoulder. “Hurry up or you’ll be late for Mr. Craig’s lesson! Girls? Girls! You better be awake or so help me I’ll…” Her footsteps thud up to their room and I glance at the clock. 8:36. There’s no way they’ll be out of here in time. Not unless I speed things along.  
  
  Begrudgingly, I assemble kale and strawberries and almond milk to fix the twins’ morning smoothies. Catherine has, of course, left her magazine splayed on the counter, so Darien Freeman’s face is grinning up at me. My lips curl into a sneer. There were rumors that he had signed on to the new Starfield remake, but that’s about as big of a joke as saying Carmindor will be played by a pug riding a skateboard. You don’t put a soap opera star in charge of an entire galaxy.  
  
  Ugh. I press BLEND and try not to think about it.  
  
  Upstairs, there are muffled thumps as Catherine drags the twins out of bed. This happens every morning, like clockwork.  
  
  My summertime morning routine goes like this: Wake up—coffee, extra scoop for Mondays. Catherine stoops over the morning papers, cutting out coupons. Lingers too long on purses and pretty dresses. Says something passive-aggressive about her old life. Orders me to fix breakfast. Instead, I feed the Frank. Catherine goes upstairs to yell at the twins for “forgetting” to set their alarms. I still don’t fix breakfast. Ten minutes later, the twins are fighting over the shower, and Catherine reminds me that she is the one with the deed to the house, Danielle, and unless I want her to cash in this place for a luxury condo—as if this house would ever get that much—I had better fix breakfast. So I blend up their Grinch vomit, the twins grab their matching tumblers, and Catherine shoves them out the door for tennis lessons.  
  
  The rest of my day is never much better. I’ll be five minutes late to work, but my coworker Sage—the food-truck owner’s daughter—is too engrossed in her Harajuku fashion magazines to even notice. Then it’s eight hours in the Magic Pumpkin, doling out healthy food-truck fritters to bankers in tight business suits and soccer moms with babies bouncing on their hips. Then I’m elbowing my way through the supermarket armed with coupons that make the cashier roll her eyes when I get in line (everyone hates coupons). Then home again for “family dinner,” made by me. Cue the twins’ mean comments on my cooking, then their disappearance upstairs to film a beauty vlog about the perfect cat eye or best eyeshadow pairing with ruby lips or whatever. Then dishes, leftovers, one last check on Franco, and bed.  
  
  Well, sorta. Then late-night reruns of Starfield on my Dad’s boxy TV in the corner of my room. Maybe I write a blog post about the episode, if I’m feeling inspired. Check all my Stargunner fansites for news. I fall asleep to the Federation Prince’s voice. “Look to the stars. Aim. Ignite.”  
  
  The next morning I wake up, and we do everything all over again. But this time—plot twist!—I get to work on time. Maybe Sage actually talks to me for once. Maybe the twins are nice. Maybe someone stuffs two airplane tickets to L.A. into the tip jar. Maybe I write a love-letter to episode 43 instead of criticizing the integrity of the characters as the colony blows up. Maybe I dream about Dad.  
  
  The blender growls as though it’s in pain. I let it rest and shake the kale smoothie into two separate tumblers, nervously glancing at the microwave clock. 8:41 a.m.  
  
  After sliding the twins’ breakfasts across the counter like the seasoned food service employee I am, I root around in the cabinet for the jar of peanut butter I tucked away last night. I protect my peanut butter like Smeagol protects the One Ring�  
��mine, precious—no matter what diet “we” are on as a household. Right now, Catherine’s on a paleo kick, but last month it was raw foods. Before that South Beach—or was it Atkins? Something with bacon. Next week will be low-fat or low-salt or…whatever she’s craving. Whatever food she can make me make by threatening to sell this house—Dad’s house.  
  
  I scrape out the last bit of peanut butter from the bottom of the jar, savoring its taste on my tongue. I take my victories wherever I can get them.  
  
  Upstairs, the shower turns off with a groaning of pipes. Finally. The twins are taking their sweet time this morning. Usually they enjoy tennis practice at the country club because their friends are always there. It’s the hangout spot if you’re popular and rich. As for me? Catherine’s always not-so-subtly insisting that the only thing I’m fit for at the club is toting someone’s golf clubs.  
  
  I dispose of the peanut butter jar in the garbage and check my indestructible brick phone, which I “inherited” after Dad died. Another grand idea from the stepmonster, another way to save the money we barely have: the twins were allowed to buy new ones, but if I wanted a phone, I had to take what I could find in the house. It’s huge—you can practically fend off a ship full of Reavers with it—but at least it tells the time.  
  
  8:43 a.m. Can’t they leave any sooner? Just once. Just once be out of the house by 9 a.m.  
  
  They’re upstairs, but Chloe’s nasally voice can be heard clear as a bell. “But, Mom, Darien Freeman’s going to be on TV this morning! I will not miss that.”  
  
  My heart sinks. If Chloe commandeers the TV, there’s no way I’ll get to watch Hello, America.  
  
  “We can be a few minutes late,” echoes Calliope. Cal sides with Chloe on everything. They’re the same age as I am—rising seniors—but we might as well be on different planets. Chloe and Calliope are starters on the varsity tennis team. Organizers of the homecoming committee. Prom leaders. And they don’t mind using their popularity to remind everyone at school that I’m practically dirt. That without their family, I’d be an orphan.  
  
  Thanks. Like I could forget that.  
  
  “We can’t miss this,” Chloe says. “We have to watch it and vlog about it or everyone else will get their reactions up before us. And that would kill us, Mom. It would kill us.

Sweeties, I’m paying Mr. Craig a handsome tuition to teach you girls tennis. I am not wasting your varsity positions next year for a television program!” Catherine descends the stairs and reenters the kitchen, rustling through her purse. “Danielle, have you seen my cell phone?”  
  
  I reach over the counter to unhook it from the wall charger. “Here it is.”  
  
  “Now why did you put it there?” She takes the phone from me without a second glance and begins scrolling through her Facebook feed. “Oh,” she adds, “and remember, tomorrow is—”  
  
  “Yeah,” I say. “I know.” Like I’d forget the day my own father died. “Should I get orchids this year or—”  
  
  “Girls!” Catherine yells, checking her watch. “Get down here now!”  
  
  “Fine!” They trample down the stairs in their tennis whites and grab their smoothies from the counter. The twins are the spitting image of Catherine. Light hair, hazel eyes, pouty heartbreaker lips. Chloe and my stepmom are cut from the same cloth, but Cal’s cut a little different, a little quieter. I think that’s because she takes after her own dad, who ran off when the girls were young and married the daughter of some Atlantic City casino owner.  
  
  Right now, they both have their blonde hair pulled back into tight ponytails, and they’d be impossible to tell apart if you didn’t know Calliope always matches her earrings to her purple glasses, and Chloe has a new nail color every day—today, a sweet summer blue. Sometimes evil comes in disguise.  
  
  “This isn’t fair! Why doesn’t Elle have to go to these stupid lessons?” Chloe whines.  
  
  “Girls.” My stepmother tsks, putting on a patient smile. “Elle has to make do with the talents she does have.”  
  
  I try to ignore her as I grab my house keys from the bowl in the foyer and put them in my satchel, pretending like I’m getting ready for work. Sometimes I think Catherine just forgets I’m in the room.  
  
  “You’re going to ruin our career,” Chloe accuses, sucking on her green smoothie. “We need to be on top of this.”  
  
  “Everyone else will be tweeting about it,” Calliope adds.  
  
  “Ever since we got a hundred thousand views because of our Seaside Cove makeup tutorial, people expect us to be on our game!”  
  
  “GIRLS!” Catherine jabs a pink nail toward the door. “Four hundred dollar lessons. NOW!”  
  
  Calliope rolls her eyes, grabs her purse from the rack in the foyer, and storms out the door to the red Miata (another “necessity” for Catherine’s “image”). Catherine glares at the remaining twin. If there is one thing Chloe can’t stand up to, it’s her mother’s disapproval. She grabs her purse too—the exact same as Cal has, except pink—and stomps out after her sister. I don’t envy that ride to practice.  
  
  My stepmom gives one last victory fluff to her hair in the foyer mirror. “Are you sure you don’t want me to put in a good word for you at the club, Danielle? I’m sure they’d take you back even after your…incident…last year. You’ve learned, haven’t you?”  
  
  To never trust a guy again? Sure. I pull on a polite smile. “No, thanks.”  
  
  “It’s the best place for someone like you, you know.” She shakes her head. “You’ll see I’m right in the end.”  
  
  With that, she closes the door.  
  
  I wait until the Miata pulls out of the driveway before I dart into the living room and turn on the TV. 8:57. Perfect. The food truck’s supposed to pick me up at ten to head to the RiverDogs baseball game across town, so I have plenty of time. For the next hour, I will be basking in perhaps the biggest news in Starfield history.  
  
  This moment to end all moments—or maybe begin them. A new Starfield for a new generation. I like the possibility in that.  
  
  Grabbing the remote from the coffee table, I sit down cross-legged in front of the 54-inch TV. The black screen flickers, and anticipation blooms in my chest. I wish Dad could be here to see this. I wish he could be sitting beside me. He’d be just as excited—no, he’d be more excited. But the reality is, I don’t really have anyone to fangirl about this with. About who will finally don the Federation starwings and follow in the legendary footsteps of David Singh, the original Prince Carmindor. I’ve been blogging about it for months in my little corner of the world, but no one really reads it. Rebelgunner is therapeutic, more like a journal. The closest I have to friends is the online Stargunner community, where everyone’s been speculating about the casting: maybe the guy from the latest Spider-Man movie? Or maybe that cute Bollywood star who’s in all the Tumblr GIFsets? Whoever it is, they’d better not whitewash my prince.  
  
  On the TV, Hello, America is wrapping up a segment about pets doing goofy things on the internet. The host beams, and then the camera cuts to the audience. It’s full of girls—lots of girls—and all of them are cheering. Holding signs. Wearing T-shirts with the same name scribbled across them. A name that makes the anticipation in my chest grow cold and drop like an atomic bomb into my stomach.  
  
  Darien Freeman.  
  
  The girls throw up their hands for the camera, screaming his name. One person’s name. Some look like they’re literally going to swoon.  
  
  I don’t swoon.  
  
  My excitement makes a U-turn into dread.  
  
  No—no, this can’t be right. I must have the wrong channel.  
  
  I jab the remote INFO button. Hello, America, the caption states, and I want nothing more than for the Black Nebula to swallow me whole.  
  
  What are the odds? What are the odds of him being on the same morning talk show? What are the odds of him being the guest appearance on the show that will announce the Starfield cast?  
  
  But the host is smiling, and says a few choice words, and suddenly all my fears come to light.  
  
  The Starfield logo blazes across the screen behind her. This moment has become a train wreck I can’t look away from. It’s my entire fandom crashing into a burning, bubbling pit of despair.  
  
  No. No, it’s not him. It can’t be him.  
  
  Darien Freeman is not my Federation Prince Carmindor.  
  
  THE CROWD IS FULL OF MONSTERS.  
  
  Okay, not actual monsters. But you try flying to New York City on a red-eye, subsisting on nothing but burnt coffee and half a grapefruit, sitting for thirty minutes in a makeup chair just so your stylist can get your curly hair just right (for God’s sake, man, it’s hair), in designer jeans that are pinching you in places that aren’t even awake this early while you’re trying to remember the answers to all the questions the cohosts are going to ask you—all on three hours of sleep, three—and then being excited to see a crowd of fans.  
  
  Breathe, I tell myself. It’s fine.  
  
  I pace back and forth behind the outside stage. No one has spotted me yet, but my skin’s crawling as if I’m being watched. It comes with the territory.  
  
  Now I know why Gail, my handler, told me to pop two Advil before the show. I’ve been to rock concerts (and, back in the day, convention panels), but this audience is ridiculous. Gail said they’ve been standing out here since four this morning. What person in their right mind would stand in line that early for me?  
  
  Beside me, Gail bounces on her well-worn sneakers. I don’t think she’s had the chance to unlace them since the second episode of Seaside Cove. She’s scrolling through her emails, nodding. “Everything’s set. We’ve got your flight booked for tonight, your ride to and from the airport, two assistants running interference for paparazzi…” Then she looks up at me and smiles. “We’re golden.”  
  
  She hands me a water bottle, and I put it against my neck. Her strawberry-blonde hair is pulled back into a too-tight frizzy bun, a sure sign she’s just as stressed as I am. “Just breathe. You’ll be fine. This is just the starter course for the media blitz. You can do it.”  
  
  “You could say I’m leveling up,” I joke.  
  
  She gives me a blank look.  
  
  “Like in video games? When you get enough experience points you—shutting up now.” I unscrew the bottle and take a swig. Through the gap in the backstage curtains, I watch my fans shift impatiently. I squint. “Is that  
girl wearing my face on her shirt?”  
  
  “Don’t pay too much attention,” she replies. Her phone beeps and she pulls it out again. She frowns.  
  
  I give her a side-eye. “Everything all right?”  
  
  She scrolls through her email.  
  
  “Earth to Gail?”  
  
  Nothing.  
  
  “Gail Morgan O’Sullivan.”  
  
  “What? Oh!” She shoves her phone into her back pocket. “Sorry, sorry. Do you ever feel like you’re forgetting something?”  
  
  “My underwear. All the time,” I say with dead seriousness. “Sometimes I give myself a wedgie just to make sure I have them on.”  
  
  Her worry cracks open into a small smile. “You do not.”  
  
  Gail is older—twenty-five or so—with a brushing of freckles on her cheeks that darken in the summer, and almost glow when she blushes. Aside from my signed copy of Batman: Year One, she’s the best friend I’ve got. When you’re me, real friends don’t come all that easy. Or at all. They used to, but I learned the hard way that things change. Especially when you’re famous.  
  
  A stagehand comes over to mic me. I thread it under my blazer and clip the receiver to the back of my jeans. “Two minutes,” he says, and rushes away.  
  
  “Oh-kay!” Gail says. “Remember to smile and just be the best you you can be.” She looks me over with an eagle eye, putting a lock of hair back in place and straightening the blazer over my T-shirt. It’s the most expensive thing I own—the blazer, not the T-shirt—as per my agent’s request. He wants me to look approachably geeky but still Burberry-wearing Seaside Cove material. Which, as far as I’m concerned, are two streams that you shouldn’t ever cross.  
  
  “Look to the stars. Aim. Ignite.” Gail chants. She hugs me tightly. “I’m so proud of you, Darien. Your dad is too.”  
  
  “Proud of the money,” I mumble.  
  
  Her mouth twitches. “I don’t think it’s just—”  
  
  The audience’s shrill cheer cuts through her words. Just shrill, all-hell-loose screams. I’m pretty sure my costar Jessica Stone—sweet, popular, with an indie-film track record that’s way more impressive than my Seaside Cove stint—gets a crowd that’s a lot…calmer. Her dude followers don’t draw I HEART JESS on T-shirts, they just…well, never mind. I don’t really want to think about the creepy Google searches of Jess Stone fans. Our crowds are different, end of story. The Starfield director, Amon Wilkins, of giant robot movie fame, probably figured she would bring in the coveted awards attention and accolades. But I guess I’ll find out soon enough, since we start filming tomorrow.  
  
  As for me? I apparently bring an army of monsters to a beloved cult fandom. My fans call themselves SeaCos—or maybe it’s Darienites. And today? This is a publicity stunt. This is my manager and PR team at their finest.  
  
  Scotty can beam me up anytime now.  
  
  That’s the thing too. I know I’m not the first young guy to take over a character that people already love. I’m sure Chris Pine had people who didn’t like him because he was Kirk 2.0. But I’m different. I’m eighteen. He was twenty-something. He had time to refine his No Fraks Given. I still worry about matching my socks and making sure no one uncovers my Star Wars boxers. Plus, right now, my hands are clammy and I think I’m starting to sweat, and sweating during a televised interview is the worst possible thing you can do.  
  
  Breathe in, breathe out. You can do this, Darien.  
  
  The stagehand rounds back and corrals me up the steps to the stage. He starts counting down with his fingers.  
  
  Five…four…  
  
  I smooth my blazer. Swallow my anxiety.  
  
  “And now let’s welcome our next guest to the stage,” one of the cohosts says, quieting the crowd, “the young actor better known as the king of Seaside Cove”—Holy Ego-Crusher, Batman, that knocks off all my street-cred—“and now picking up the mantle as our favorite royal from the stars, Federation Prince Carmindor…Darien Freeman!”  
  
  Breathe in. Breathe out. Put on a smile.  
  
  Like a superhero donning a mask, I step out of me and into Darien Freeman, swallowed up by the ravaging screams of five hundred teenage girls.  
  
  THE BEAUTIFUL FACE—ANNOYINGLY BEAUTIFUL, the kind you’ll remember because it’ll be plastered on every fragrance ad and billboard for the next ten years—of Darien Freeman stretches across the entirety of my stepmother’s 54-inch plasma TV, grinning in an easygoing sort of way. Brown skin, long eyelashes, curly hair. He might look the part, but his smile’s so bright it’s almost blinding. Not dour, brooding Federation Prince material. Not even cut from the same cloth.  
  
  Carmindor smiled only once in all fifty-four episodes. At Princess Amara in episode 53. The episode before—  
  
  No, no. No one thinks about that last episode, let alone talks about it. It never happened. I even blacklisted any mention of it from my blog.  
  
  Rockefeller Center is crowded with Starfield blue and silver. A gaggle of fangirls in the front row wave around STARCRUSH ME! and I WANT TO WABBA-WABBA WITH YOU signs like they’ve all watched the interstellar missions against the Nox firsthand. Which they haven’t.  
  
  Even I haven’t.  
  
  Dad, though…he was there from the beginning. The original fanboy. He even started a convention for it. ExcelsiCon. We went every year. I remember meeting the aging cast, getting my stargun signed. Hiding it in my book bag during school. Waking up every morning to Dad’s alarm clock playing the theme song. Eating Wabba-Wabba Flakes for breakfast (which were really Frosted Flakes, but six-year-old me didn’t know the difference). Stargazing in the summers and pretending to defeat the Nox in our backyard. Saving the galaxy from being sucked into the Black Nebula…  
  
  Living with Dad was like living in a universe where the Federation Prince Carmindor existed.  
  
  And then—in the blink of an eye—that universe vanished.  
  
  My finger hovers over the POWER button on the remote, but I can’t seem to look away. How will Seaside Cove fans clash with us Stargunners? It’s like seeing two souped-up racecars headed for a collision at full speed—I have to watch.  
  
  Leaning back in the comfy-looking chair, Darien Freeman waves—a little shy, a little taken aback—to his sea of fans as the cohosts welcome him to the show. I’m sure he thinks it’s cute.  
  
  “It’s great to be here,” Darien Freeman begins. His fans screech like ambulance sirens: “I love you, Darien!” and “Marry me!”  
  
  Ugh, gag me.  
  
  One of the cohosts, a guy with a massive chin, says, “We’re so excited to have you! I remember—and this might date me—but I remember staying up late just to watch the show. It’s a classic! How do you feel stepping into a role as big as Carmindor?”  
  
  The actor smiles. His teeth are too white, his lips too balanced—I bet he practices it in the mirror. “It’s an honor, for sure,” he says, even though he wouldn’t know a classic if it shot phaser cannons at him. “And I’m looking forward to stepping into Carmindor. Big shoes to fill.”  
  
  “Big boots, you mean,” I say to no one. David Singh was phenomenal. A barrier breaker in the days when almost no other sci-fi shows had a lead actor of color. An advocate for human rights, onscreen and off. A man who tell truly believed in the philosophy of Starfield.  
  
  “Well, unlike Rick here, I never watched Starfield,” says the second cohost, a petite woman in a white pantsuit who probably doesn’t mean to look like a Stormtrooper but totally does. “But it seems like everyone knows about it these days! That motto—how does it go?”  
  
  “Look to the stars. Aim. Ignite,” Darien says. “And I hope you become a fan. Starfield has a little something for everyone. It’s a story about the good ship Prospero and its crew as they fight to protect the galaxy and uphold the standards of peace and equality. Oh”—he grins—“and fight aliens.”  
  
  “That sounds downright terrifying!” The cohost gasps. I roll my eyes. “Fight aliens” is not how I’d describe facing down the Nox King—technically the humans are the aliens in the series. But then again, I’m an actual Stargunner.  
  
  “Now, don’t hate us fo  
r this,” the cohost goes on, “but we like to play little games on our show, and since you seem to know so much about Starfield, I thought I could challenge you to Dunk Tank!”  
  
  The camera pans wide to a water-filled booth with a bull’s-eye on the side. The camera cuts back to Darien, looking—well, faking—a shocked expression. “Oh man! Really?”  
  
  “Of course!” Then the cohost reaches behind her chair and pulls out a water gun. “Let’s see how well you can school us in Starfield! Every time you get an answer wrong, I get to take a shot at you.”  
  
  Oh, I think. This’ll be good. There’s no way he knows anything about the series beyond its name.  
  
  The crowd begins to chant in a loud, raucous voice. “Dunk tank! Dunk tank! Dunk tank!”  
  
  Darien throws his arms out to the crowd dramatically. “Really? Really? You want to see me get dunked?”  
  
  “Dunk tank! Dunk tank!” the crowd chants, and I have to agree.  
  
  “What do you say, Darien?” the woman host asks, grinning.  
  
  He sighs, hanging his head—acting all oh, fine, let’s get this over with. Then he slaps his hands on the side of the armchair and stands, shrugging out of his expensive-looking blazer. “All right! You’re on.”  
  
  Oh yeah? Let’s see what you’ll get wrong, Darien Freeman. I fold my arms and settle back in my chair. Onscreen, Darien climbs up onto the dunk tank, securing goggles around his eyes, and gives the thumbs-up.  
  
  The woman cocks her water gun and looks at a card in her hand. “Question one! What is the name of the government that Carmindor is a part of?”  
  
  “Seriously? Too easy!” Darien shouts back at her. “The Federation!”  
  
  A buzzer dings, signaling the right answer, and the audience boos, shouting to dunk him already. Something goes flying past Darien’s head—I think it’s underwear. He doesn’t look fazed in the least, grinning from ear to ear, swinging his feet underneath the plank he’s sitting on.

So last year i started woodworking again for the first time since middle school and i immediately fell back in love with it. I joined a maker space near my university but unfortunately, while staining my first project, I was sexually harassed by someone that worked in the building the maker space was in. I quit the maker space and stopped woodworking for the rest of the semester. This summer, I had a job near where I grew up and joined a different maker space in a different city and again felt so fulfilled and happy! Just yesterday I finished building a coffee table and am so proud of it! I leave this weekend to go back to school and I want to continue woodworking in my apartment. I have a small outdoor space i could bring tools out to as needed but would like to be able to do some projects inside at my kitchen counter with minimal power tools. Does anyone have any advice for me to start? I want to tackle some small projects inside my apartment and not need to invest thousands and my whole home (and the friendship of my neighbors) to build. What should I do? What should I make? What do I need? What should I be looking into? Thanks for any advice! ",1,1755795563.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,3,1.0,False

After a really great cup, my friend picked up a bag of their sangria co-ferment.

Terms I've seen thrown around but didn't really understand until visiting this shop after they opened up. 

I'm fairly new to specially coffee, but I can't emphasize enough how great it has been to have friendly, knowledgeable roasters and baristas in town to learn from.

I moved to Canada about 2 years ago and have been living in Halifax since then. I did my Master’s here and now work full-time. I’m 30, male.

English isn’t my first language, but I learned it from a young age. I can speak pretty smoothly, but I struggle with confidence around native speakers because of my accent. Sometimes I feel it limits how well I communicate, especially at work or in group settings.

I’d love to find someone to practice with — maybe meet up at a park, coffee shop, or library for casual conversations. I’m not super outgoing, but I’m really trying to improve.

If you’d like someone to talk to when you’re feeling bored or lonely, I’d be glad to be that person — and in return, I get to practice my communication skills. Win–win!

One will be for me, and the design will be breadboard ends, round legs (to try out a table saw lathe I just built) - working together a combination of round and rectangular aesthetics - round drawboard pegs showing on the top, and through-holes for the legs.  Also, the material for this is just shy of 4/4, so I want the round legs to give a lightweight feeling.

For the next table, I have 6/4 for the table top, and 8/4 for legs. Beefy and heavyweight, so I'm thinking of going in arts and crafts or mission style. I also have a hollow chisel mortiser that I bought a couple of years ago but have been to busy to use. 

The third table -- no idea. The material for this is thin. May just be a sort of run of the mill, panel with four legs (possibly tapered legs), with arched aprons.

1mwgk9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mwgk9g/discover_the_ultimate_possiave_keurig_charcoal/,Discover the ultimate Possiave Keurig charcoal water filter review for better-tasting coffee!,"If there’s one thing I’ve learned as an avid coffee drinker, it’s that the quality of the water you use can make or break your brew. The **Possiave CECOMINOD042739 12-Pack Keurig Compatible Water Filters** has completely transformed my morning ritual. It’s the little things, like a better cup of coffee, that truly matter when starting your day. The promise of cleaner, tastier water for coffee was intriguing, but using these charcoal filters daily has been a game changer.

**Flawless Compatibility for Keurig Users**

Finding filters that fit perfectly into your coffee maker can be more frustrating than assembling IKEA furniture without the manual. These replacement filters are designed for universal compatibility with both Keurig 2.0 and 1.0 models. Whether you’re using the Classic or the Elite, these filters slide right in without any hassle. My own Keurig Classic welcomed them like an old friend. This attention to compatibility is a breath of fresh air for anyone juggling multiple Keurig models or sharing appliances in multi-person households.

[See Possiave CECOMINOD042739 deals on Amazon now.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00x9805go/)

**The Taste Revolution for Coffee Lovers**

Ever had a cup of coffee that tasted…off? Impurities like chlorine and calcium can alter the flavor more than you think. These filters use activated charcoal sourced from natural coconut shells to banish those contaminants. It’s not just about cleanliness; it’s about unlocking the true flavor profile of your coffee beans. I noticed the improvement instantly. My favorite dark roast went from “good” to “wow, someone should open a coffee shop with this.”

**Durability and Effectiveness**

Each charcoal filter is encased in micromesh material designed to hold the carbon securely while preventing clogging. It’s easy to overlook this feature, but let me tell you—it’s a lifesaver for your coffee maker. After weeks of testing, there were no clogs, no leaks, and no mysterious black particles showing up in my coffee. This doesn’t just save time; it prolongs the life of your machine. Plus, the filters last long enough to justify the initial bulk buy.

**Good Aspects**

- Universal compatibility with both Keurig 1.0 and 2.0 models.
- Enhanced coffee flavor thanks to natural coconut-shell activated charcoal.
- Durable micromesh material to prevent clogging.
- Long lifespan per filter, ideal for Keurig enthusiasts.

**Bad Points**

- Not biodegradable, which may bother eco-conscious buyers.
- Requires manual installation, which might seem fiddly to some.

**Size and Build Considerations**

These filters are small—1 x 2 x 5 inches to be precise—and weigh just 2.12 ounces. While they’re compact enough not to hog real estate in your pantry, installing them in my Keurig Classic was straightforward but slightly snug. I wouldn’t call it a dealbreaker, but if your reservoir is particularly tight, you might need to jiggle it a bit to fit comfortably.

**Competing Products**

The market does have its alternatives, with brands like Geesta and Housewares Solutions offering similar replacements. From my experience, though, this pack delivers superior flavor enhancement and overall build quality. While some competitors might provide a slightly larger quantity per pack, they don’t seem to have the same thoughtful attention to the micromesh durability or natural materials. Pricewise, these filters fall into a comparable range with fewer compromises, making them a solid competitor in this crowded arena.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering what these filters offer, they’re worth every penny. Splashing out a bit for better-tasting coffee that also extends your machine’s usability feels like a no-brainer. Sure, buying a cheaper, off-brand filter pack might seem tempting, but their lesser quality could lead to clogging or even machine damage. Opting for these filters means prioritizing long-term value over instant savings. If excellent coffee is as integral to your day as it is to mine, the investment feels justifiable.

1mwgjse,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mwgjse/something_was_in_my_bedroom_last_night/,Something was in my bedroom last night.,"Something was in my room last night..

I was alone, laying in my bed underneath the snow white sheets; a nice, cool saturday night.. My phone screen, illuminating the dark room in a blueish-white tint, revealed something concealed within the shadows.. I gasped, quickly shinning my only source of light out towards the possible intruder, but nothing came of it. 'I must be overtired', I thought to myself. 
I lay my head down on my pillow, and close my heavy eyelids..

But something was off. 

A strange, dreadful feeling convulsed inside me, and a feeling, reminiscent of cold, wet ice cubes sliding down my back overtook me.. 

I felt a fiddling in my undergarments... And at this point, I knew the cruel fate that awaited for me.
The foreskin fiddler was here, and he was feeling fiddly. He's come for the pickle, and he will ALWAYS yank on your snizzle... Pure evil. A true monster of the night. But unluckily for the creature, I had a trick up my sleeve.. I had no sleeve.... I was circumcised. I smiled, 'checkmate'. The creature, slowly unbuckled my pants, revealing the truth.. It was shocked, never before, has it mistaken a circism for a uncircism. It snarled furiously, and retreated into the darkness. Satisfaction overcame me, as I proudly pulled up my pants and shut my eyes for some well deserved rest. 

This morning, in a groggy state, I shuffled to my breakfast nook, preparing myself for another day at the office. I took out a instant coffee container, and began boiling some water. While I was waiting, I noticed something strange in the corner of my eye, that familiar sense of dread washed over me. I shifted my eyes quickly to the source of the disturbance, only to see not the creature, but a note sloppily pinned to the wall. While recovering from the shock of this strange discovery, I forgot to tend to the boiling water, and it overflowed onto the kitchen floor. I quickly run to the kettle and take it off the heat. 

It's toying with me, it's all part of its sick game.. With shaking hands, I decided to open the crudely folded note; written in blood, (I presume foreskin blood) it read in blotchy red letters: ""Where is your foreskin, Alex?"" Out of anger, frustration and fear, I crumbled up the paper and threw it aganist the wall. I began to scream with rage, as I kicked over my trash can and swiped my framed pictures and paintings off the walls of my house. Afterwards, I collapsed in a heap on the ground, and sobbed quietly. 

I thought I could rid my family of this curse, breaking the bond the fiddler had. But to no avail, it still resides here, with me as it's chosen victim. I don't know what to do about this anymore, and after this is all said and done. I still have one question that haunts me, if the foreskin fiddler has no foreskin to fiddle, what is it gonna fiddle next..?",1,1755795284.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

We decided to open up to ENM a couple of years back. We/I mostly hook up via an app, my wife finds her play dates in the real world. A couple of month back I started flirting with a lady F45 that we both know, if the knowledge and acceptance of my wife. The door was open so to speak, the lady asked me out for lunch, then for a coffee and then for a drink. The meetings were very intimate in the subjects discussed, but hardly any physical contact was made. Just deep looks in the eyes, ocassional touch of the arm etc. I learned that she and her her husband are in a DADT kind of situation and that they only meet to play when out of town, so I thought that my chances to progress with her are small. Anyhow we had a very good connection and could talk for hours.
On the 3rd date, right at the beginning, I passed her warm regards from my wife and she acted surprised/suspicious/skeptical about it.
Later that evening we were all over one another, kissing deeply, playing with our tongs and almost lingering. She gave me a dry hand job under the table and asked that next time we get a room for ourselves. She did ask to keep it a secret and act normal when we meet in events. I agreed. After that date I texted her that we (my wife and I) think that it would be better for everybody if we all (us and her) meet for coffee to be transparent and take the awkwardness out of the situation. The lady freaked out and said that she explicitly asked me not to tell.my wife, although I explicitly told her that my wife is totally aware of what is happening and about to happen between us. Long story short, I didn't and don't lie or hide anything from my wife. The lady opted out and I didn't chase her, respecting her choice.

Can somebody shed some light on her behavior? Any ideas if this is reversible, cause I really liked her and connected. We haven't seen or communicated in a month, besides FB likes. Sooner or later we will all see each other at an event.

I hope some can help you. Usually for me, a new thing helps for anywhere from a couple weeks to several months and then it just doesn’t help anymore, so I’m always hoping for more ideas. Some are more obvious but some are weiiiird so read the whole list! 

- highly contorted stretches. I usually grab things and pull with my arms as hard as I can, relax my shoulders then pull again and repeat until it hurts but in a good way. Another one is to turn your head all the way to the side while pulling your shoulders downward. Also sometimes I just lay in bed and keep curling backwards like a back bend until it hurts and resting there and then when it stops feeling tight curl back more and also throw my legs out to the side lol. Sometimes that entirely gets rid of the flair up even in mid-stages

- lay on your stomach and smash your jaw to the side (whichever feels better) really hard until you start to drool. It’s gross, but the drooling means it’s working lol. Stay there for 20+ mins, usually I fall asleep even if I’m not tired. It helps the pain a lot and sometimes makes it go away.

- in the same vein as the one above, sleep on the floor. I guess the hardness just helps sometimes?

- getting in the shower with  eye or occipital areas centered on the stream of water and alternating between icy and really hot water

- eating extremely crunchy food like corn nuts

- biting my fist or an object but shoving it as far back into my teeth on the affected side as possible

- going into a crystal shop lol. Not because of the woo but because looking at pretty rocks is very relaxing I guess

- calisthenics. It’s hard as hell at first, your body will throw a fit but if you stick with it for some weeks and get up to 2-3 sessions of an hour every week it will help reduce flair up frequency 

- avoiding diary, sugar, simple carbs, and meat definitely has reduced my flair ups and recovery time 

- pulling your hair. Just learned from a massage therapist that pulling and twisting clumps of hair on your trigger points or patches of sensitive scalp is a safer way of breaking up fascia than scalp massage 

- massaging your arm on the inside near the elbow joint and on the outside a bit higher up. There is something there that feels like a rope, not sure what. Another massage therapist I had called it a chakra line and when she massaged it I screamed and cried but the TN pain stopped like magic. Unfortunately I must have used this one all up bc it hasn’t been working the past couple months :(

- checking your shoulder alignment or getting a shoulder massage. Sometimes my shoulder would pop out of socket or get stuck partly out or down and weirdly shoulders can cause you not to be able to breathe out of your nose like it’s completely stuffed! Also affect ability to draw deep breaths

- stab your finger up and behind your eyeball (carefully!) it seems to relieve pressure. It doesn’t fix anything but it does make it a lot more bearable 

- use all of your mental focus to one by one go through each muscle in your face, neck, and shoulders to make sure they relax. Like eyebrows, jaw, crows feet area etc. usually I have to keep going back because if I don’t actively focus on keeping a muscle relaxed it tenses again

- caffeine pills instead of soda/tea/coffee. Something about the pills is like it’s all hitting at once instead of over a longer period or something. I can’t take more than a 3rd of a pill or I get jitters. This used to nearly always work but now it’s down to 10% chance so ofc I still take that chance haha

- jab your fingers or get someone to massage the base of your skull, underneath it as much as possible right next to the spine.

- ice pack on your eye or scalp makes things more bearable 

- if your pain ever spreads to your legs or hips, massage just a bit toward the outside of your lower shins/above the ankle area. There are fascia there that get inflamed and affect the whole leg 

- again for leg pain, massage underneath the bone of your heal. My massage therapist made a hook shape with her hand to get her finger tips up under there

- stop laying or sitting down. Lots of pressure points get touched when laying or sitting especially when using a pillow. I know it sucks when you’re stuck in a looop of soooo tired which is making the pain worse but sitting/lying hurts a lot but also standing hurts too. But standing is always the better option because less trigger points get touched. Plus if you lay down you won’t be able to sleep anyway be for real

- sleep less. Or more. If I sleep longer than 7.5 hours exactly I WILL wake up with head pain that devolves into a full flair up. Usually I feel quite energized after 3 or 6 hours sleep, oddly. I use a hue bulb on a sunrise timer pointed at my face. It ends with a blue-white light that makes you feel more awake, and I keep my phone away from bed so that I’m not tempted to stay in bed. But when I DO oversleep or lay in bed too long, I can not get rid of the pain no matter what I do unless I sleep again. Lol




Things that other people say help but don’t help me:

- CBD/ marijuanna makes me extremely anxious and sends me into fits of muscle spasms

- Ashwaganda. same as CBD 

- Tylenol + ibuprofen. Doesn’t make the meds any more effective for me  

- breathing exercises. Idk it just does nothing 

- applied heat just annoys me

It comes in waves, then settles down. I thought I was adjusting, but yesterday it came back with a vengeance. I need to be able to function at work and in life—just to feel like myself again, you know?

I understand side effects are part of the process, and if I knew they would go away, I’d stick it out until week 4. But if I’m still feeling off, which kit would be the better switch? For context, I’ve never been on antidepressants before.

Coffee in the morning is non-negotiable for me, but I think the bupropion amps up the side effects. On the bright side, I’ve appreciated cutting back on drinking, though I still enjoy an occasional glass of wine. Would Kit 5 be a better alternative if these side effects don’t improve? ( I don’t know anything about Kit 5 ) I know each kit has its own challenges, but honestly… crazy, no coffee, and no wine at all?!

I feel like I’m doing my part: eating well, exercising, staying hydrated, and getting good sleep. Where’s the sweet spot here?

For what it’s worth, taking the green pill at night has helped me a lot. Taking the bupropion with my first meal and plenty of water has also made a difference. I just cannot imagine taking two BP’s. I will definitely scale back the dosage to one for now. Seems to be working fine so far, except my mind! lol 

Any insight would be appreciated!

Thank you, and good luck to everyone on this journey—I’m grateful to have found such a wealth of information here. :)

1mwg92p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_by_AlphaInsights/comments/1mwg92p/breville_asxbrg_why_australias_premium_appliance/,# Breville (ASX:BRG) - Why Australia's Premium Appliance Darling is 60% Overvalued at $36.18 Despite 10-Year Growth Streak [Institutional Analysis],"## The Thesis

Breville is an exceptional company trading at an inexcusable valuation. At $36.18, it's priced for perfection that mathematics says is impossible to achieve.

**Fair Value: $14.50 | Current Price: $36.18 | Expected Return: -60%**

## Why This Matters Now
- Trading at 30.0x EV/EBITDA vs peer median 14.2x (88% premium!)
- Market pricing in >75% probability of flawless execution across all initiatives
- Manufacturing diversification creating hidden margin pressure not yet visible
- Even management's track record can't justify these multiples

## The Numbers (Probability-Weighted DCF)
- Bull Case (20% prob): $20.78 → Still -43% from current
- Base Case (50% prob): $13.12 → -64% downside  
- Bear Case (25% prob): $9.40 → -74% downside
- Severe Case (5% prob): $4.72 → -87% downside

**Expected Value: $13.31**

## Three Things the Market is Missing

### 1. Mean Reversion is Mathematical Certainty
- Q: How can 16% EBITDA margins compress when they've held for 10 years?
- A: Competitive advantage period = 3-5 years, not forever
- SharkNinja growing at 22.5% vs BRG's 10.9%
- Terminal margins MUST converge to industry average (~14%)

### 2. Manufacturing Diversification is Margin Destructive (Short-Term)
- Mexico/SEA production costs 15-20% MORE than China
- $85m transition investment with 3-year payback
- Market thinks this improves margins immediately - it doesn't
- Q2 FY26 will be the ""surprise"" catalyst

### 3. Digital Platforms Are Years From Monetization
- Breville+ and beanz ecosystem <5% of revenue
- User adoption metrics conspicuously absent from reports
- Tech giants (Apple, Google) could obliterate this ""moat"" instantly
- Platform economics require scale BRG doesn't have

## The Valuation Reality Check

To justify $36.18, you need ONE of:
- Revenue growth of 18.5% forever (currently 10.9%)
- EBITDA margins of 19%+ (never exceeded 17.5%)
- Terminal growth of 4.5% (GDP is 2.5%)
- WACC of 7.5% (should be 12%)

**None of these pass the laugh test.**

## The Quality Trap Warning

Business Quality Score: 6.1/10 (below peer average!)
- 10-year growth streak ✓
- Premium positioning ✓  
- Net cash position ✓
- Great management ✓

**But great companies become terrible investments at stupid prices**

Quality investors are the last to sell - that's the opportunity.

## Risk/Reward for Different Investors
- **Current Shareholders**: Exit now. No path to positive returns from here
- **Value Hunters**: Set alerts for sub-$12 (might take 18 months)
- **Short Sellers**: Asymmetric opportunity with natural catalysts approaching

## Key Monitorables
1. Q1 FY26: Manufacturing transition cost ""surprises""
2. Q2 FY26: China revenue miss (watch for <$50m run rate)
3. Any SharkNinja coffee category announcement
4. Platform user metrics (if they ever disclose them)

1mwfwvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mwfwvg/zp6_pour_over_helpi/,ZP6 & Pour Over HelpI=],"I’ve been trying to do an at home pour over for five months and I’m having zero luck at getting it right.

I started with a K6 grinder and recently got a ZP6. Ninety-nine percent of the time my cups are either way too sour or too biter. Every now and then I have gotten lucky with both making a good cup, but can never replicate it. 

The main two recipes I have been doing….

RECIPE 1: 5 Pours  
12g of coffee to 200g of water  
Water - 91c to 93c  
Dripper: V60 plastic  
Water: Volvic bottled water or Mont Blanc bottled water.  
Gooseneck Kettle  
0:00 - 30g of water  
0:30 - up to 70g of water with higher faster pour spiraling outward, and slight swirl when done.  
1:00 - up to 110g Spiral pour with a bit less height than the first  
1:30 - up to 160g A lower spiral pour with less agitation  
2:00 - up to 200g  A final spiral more gentle pour  
As long as not Ethiopian this usually finishes draining around 3 minute mark.

RECIPE 2: 3 Pours  
12g of coffee to 200g of water  
Water - 91c to 93c  
Dripper: V60 plastic with drip assist to slow pour  
Water: Volvic bottled water  
Gooseneck Kettle  
0:00 - 50g of water in center of drip assist for faster pour  
0:30 - up to 100g of water in outside ring of drip assist for more gentle pour  
1:00 - up to 200g of water in outside ring of drip assist slow poured.  
As long as not an ethiopian this usually finishes draining around 1:45-2min.

I’ve tried recipes with two pours. I’ve tried four pours. I’ve tried mixing and matching more agitation or using the drip assist to have low agitation. I’ve dropped my temps down to mid 80’s and up to high 90’s. No matter what I do the cups I make are almost always too sour or too biter. 

My understanding is when too sour that means I’ve under extracted and when too biter that means I over extracted. I will then try to adjust finding the sweet spot on the grinder and recipe but by the time I get CLOSE to finding an okay cup of coffee the beans run out and I have to start the process over again with a whole new bag.

For beans I’m using a local roaster and a mix of the various brands I’ve seen in coffee shops in central Europe (I live in Germany near France). I usually always have a bag from DAK, April, Substance, or Datura. Datura, April, and DAK are always easy to get from my local shop. Substance I’ve picked up in person or ordered directly.

I know from going to coffee shops and getting a decent pour over that I especially like high clarity, a bit of acid, and hints of fruit or flowers. I also seem to be a fan of light washed Geishas. That said I still enjoy cups with more body or fermentation, but I’m not trying to achieve those things right now and no matter what I do or how I seem to adjust my recipes every cup seems to always be bitter or sour. 

For the grinders… at this point I’ve ground somewhere between 2kg to 3kg in the K6 and in the ZP6 I’ve only had it for a week but I put 2kg of local roasted beans through it to break it in (I dismantled and cleaned when done).

Grind sizes in the K6: (Bur lock is -4)For the K6 if I was using something super light like from Datura or Substance I was grinding around 85-88 clicks and with 5 pours getting something drinkable but generally either sour or bitter. For other slightly darker, but still light roasts, I was going as high as 120 clicks to make it not horribly bitter.  

Grind sizes in the ZP6 (Bur lock is 0) I’ve tried from 3.0 clicks up to 8.0 clicks and I can’t seem to find a range. A lot of recipes with multiple pours seem to say 4.5-5.5 range is good. While others with just one or two pours seem to suggest 3-4.5 is good.  I can’t get anything to work for me. I got almost close to a good cup of DAK coffee this morning but it was last cup on a 250g bag so I can’t even adjust or try again and the next coffee brand I used tasted AWFUL with the same grind and recipe I used for DAK.

I’m just frustrated and at a loss. I’ve asked questions at coffee shops. I’ve read dozens of posts here going through so hundreds of comments. I’ve watched videos on youtube. I KNOW I’m doing something wrong., but for the life of me I can’t figure out what.

I’m willing to try whatever changes people suggest. Heck if you have a specific bag of coffee you know works with a specific grind size and recipe I’ll even try to get that exact kind to try it myself. I just need help and not sure where to go from here.

This involves me (28F) and my stepsister, Zoey (30F). Zoey moved in with me and my mom and her dad (though he has raised me, so I see him as my dad as well) when we were 11 and 13. We were very close for the first couple of years when she moved in. Things changed when she had a boyfriend whom she cheated on. He reached out to me (and our dad) as he was having a rough go of it and still really loved her. I was trying to do damage control, tell him it would be OK and I would talk to her, etc. They got back together and I was really happy for them! He had messaged me to let me know that she wanted to be with him, and when Zoey saw that she flipped out on me. 

Now, as an adult, I can see why she felt the way she did. She felt alienated, I am sure, considering her entire family really liked the guy she was dating and so took his side. She felt I crossed a line in talking to him, even if it was to offer advice and work toward them getting back together. I get that 100%. After that, however, Zoey ignored me for 2 years. She wouldn’t talk to me at the dinner table, would fight with me over the smallest things, and when I tried to commit suicide at 16, she was angry with me. We didn’t have a great relationship. Eventually she and that boy broke up, and she had other boyfriends. I had as well. We would get into screaming matches and our boyfriends would just stand there like 🧍‍♂️

Right after I graduated high school (I was 17), I met this guy, Ryan (at the time, 20M) through Instagram. Ryan and Zoey dated for one month when she was 15 (I was 13). Ryan and I ended up dating for about 2-3 months, before I went to college. He was emotionally abusive and had a drinking problem, so it was a hot mess, and he dumped me, and that was that. Now, should I have dated my sister’s ex boyfriend, even if it had been a brief relationship? No. At the time, I justified it with “we have a terrible relationship and she couldn’t care less about me and we don’t even speak.” Our relationship got even worse after that, of course. 

Over the few years after that, we fought a lot or didn’t talk at all. I tried to make amends a handful of times, texting her to apologize and also offering to meet up for coffee so we could speak in person. Finally, in 2019 (me 21, her 23), we started to rebuild our relationship. We started talking more, I was able apologize again, and we were moving on. We even started to hang out alone and go shopping together ahead of her wedding. I would dog sit for her, and I thought we were in a really good place. 
Now, for her wedding (in 2021), I was included in her bachelorette party but not her bridal party (which I figured as much). I wasn’t invited to her bridal shower or rehearsal dinner, which hurt my feelings, but I accepted her choice. 

My brother in law (Jack), Zoey, myself and my ex boyfriend (Mark) all got along really well. We were all became close and during holidays had a lot of fun together. Jack and I even did karaoke on NYE at our parents house one night (we all took turns). That’s just to give an idea of the dynamic that grew between us. 

In 2023, I broke up with Mark after many years of being cheated on and emotionally and verbally abused. I started dating Adam (28M) not long after. I had been checked out for years with Mark and after many sessions with the therapist who finally gave me the tools (and strength and self confidence) to leave Mark, we decided I should go for it with Adam even though it was so soon after the break up. 
Adam and Jack have a sport in common, and on 2 separate occasions while having a conversation with Adam about what they could talk about (our first meetings were a little awkward and stiff), I texted Jack to ask him (1) what position he played on in the sport and (2) what his favorite team was. He gave me my answer and that was it. I told Adam, and we were glad to have something he and Jack could discuss next time we hung out.

Unbeknownst to me, Zoey did not like that. Over the last two years, she grew distant and passive aggressive. She stopped including me in things, not inviting me to my nephew or niece’s baptisms, not inviting me to my nephew’s 2nd birthday party, not saying thank you to gifts I sent for them. She began to avoid family events that I would go to. 
Several months ago, I text her to find out what was going on and offer an olive branch. I thought she was still upset about Ryan. I apologized profusely and took responsibility for having hurt her. She responded telling me that I didn’t know what it meant to be a sister and didn’t know what love was, and found it to be extremely inappropriate that I would message Jack after me and Mark broke up. She said she couldn’t trust me and that it felt like history repeating itself. I was taken aback because I hadn’t even considered me texting Jack twice to ask a question was inappropriate. She was adamant that I had crossed a line and was convinced I was just trying to foster a relationship with him through starting casual conversations. All I did was text him 2 questions. Adam remembers because he was glad to have something to talk to him about. 

I am really hurt that she would think that I would ever try to cause any issues in her marriage, start an appropriate relationship with her husband, or anything like that. I know I made mistakes as a teenager and hurt her; however, even then, I didn’t pursue anyone while she dated them. I dated an ex boyfriend (and I shouldn’t have), I didn’t try to steal him! So, our relationship is dead now. I am not the person I was 10+ years ago, and it hurts me that she not only still sees me that way, but thinks I would engage in even worse behavior than I did as a teenager.
Now, with all this in mind, Adam and I are discussing marriage. WIBTA if I don’t invite Zoey to my wedding?",15,1755793813.0,AITAH,28,0.89,False

I’m a 23-year-old guy. Most of my past years went into studies (just cleared CA), so honestly, I never really focused on relationships or even building a big social circle. Now that things have settled, I realize life feels a bit… empty.

I’m not the party or super-extrovert type. More of a calm and caring person... the kind who enjoys long conversations over coffee rather than loud places. I like when people can talk about random small things, share their day, or even just sit in silence comfortably.

Problem is...I don’t really have someone to share those little everyday things with. Apps felt too superficial, and in real life everyone already seems to have their groups or partners. Sometimes I wonder if people like me ..calm, simple, not too flashy.. actually manage to find someone who vibes with them.

Not really looking for anything casual… just wishing for that one person with whom conversations feel natural, comforting, and real.

1mwfplk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mwfplk/does_the_pur_ppf951k3_replacement_pitcher_water/,Does the PUR PPF951K3 Replacement Pitcher Water Filter Actually Improve Taste and Health? Review,"The PUR PPF951K3 Replacement Filter, 3 Count, Blue is a product I've been putting to the test over the past month. Designed to fit seamlessly into PUR's water pitcher and dispenser systems, this sleek, certified solution promises cleaner, better-tasting water while reducing contaminants like lead. As someone who drinks a lot of water daily and refuses to compromise on quality, I was genuinely intrigued by its claims. Here's how it fared in my day-to-day life.

**A Design That Gets the Job Done**

I'll admit, I never thought much about water filters' design until I started using these. The PUR PPF951K3 filters are modestly sized at 7.6""D x 2.8""W x 7.9""H but sturdy enough to inspire confidence in their durability. Made of BPA-free plastic, they feel solid in your hand without being cumbersome. The blue coloring is a nice visual cue for when it's installed correctly in the pitcher—a feature my somewhat forgetful brother appreciates! I also liked the thoughtfulness behind the LockFit design, which ensures no pesky unfiltered water sneaks its way into your glass.

**Highlights**

- Certified by NSF and WQA, offering reliability for lead reduction.
- Quick installation with the LockFit system prevents user error.
- Compact size, perfect for any standard water pitcher.

[Check PUR PPF951K3 Replacement Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b06wvdvdxb/)

**How It Performs in Daily Use**

Throughout the testing period, I tasked this product with keeping up with my coffee habits, family meals, and even the occasional hydration spree during workouts. Each of its three filters can handle up to 40 gallons of water (roughly two months), and I noticed a substantial difference in taste right away. Compared to unfiltered tap water, the difference was night and day—clean, crisp, and free from that chlorine aftertaste. While I don't have scientific tools to verify its microplastic or lead reduction claims, even my sister, who has a remarkably picky palate, commented on how much better her tea tasted.

**Positives**

- **Excellent water quality:** Great taste and no noticeable chlorine flavor.
- **Durable filters:** Each filter provides a long-lasting impact for its size.
- **Convenient maintenance:** The LockFit design means even my tech-averse dad could install it without instructions.  
- **Cost-effective:** A good alternative to bottled water for the eco-conscious.

**Areas of Concern**

There was, however, one glaring issue—the flow rate. I found that the newly installed filter worked beautifully, but by the fourth or fifth week, water started taking its sweet time getting through the filter. This wasn’t a dealbreaker, but it was a bit frustrating when I was in a rush. Another slight issue is compatibility; the filters work best with PUR and Beautiful by PUR systems, but they won’t fit other pitchers.

**Drawbacks**

- **Slower flow rate towards the end of its lifespan.**
- **Limited compatibility** with brands outside the PUR ecosystem.  

**Comparing Product Rivals**

It's impossible to discuss water filters without mentioning competitors. I’ve used Brita and ZeroWater filters in the past, and here's where the PUR PPF951K3 stands. While Brita is widely known and enjoyed for its consistent performance, its leading pitcher filters don’t tackle contaminants like lead or microplastics as effectively. ZeroWater, on the other hand, is rigorous in filtering out contaminants but often faces criticism for its higher price point and reduced filter longevity compared to PUR's options. The PUR filter navigates the middle ground: offering more advanced filtration than Brita while remaining more affordable than ZeroWater.

**Value for Money**

One significant advantage here is how eco-friendly and cost-efficient these filters are. The monthly savings compared to buying bottled water pile up quickly, and these filters don’t tear a hole in your wallet. Given that each one lasts up to two months, you’re getting high-quality filtration at an excellent value. If you prioritize reducing waste and value safe drinking water at a fair price, this product ticks all the right boxes.

● Commute → coffee → desk → repeat.


● Waiting for Friday just to feel alive again.


● Daydreaming about building something of my own.


I’d scroll Reddit and YouTube and see people booking clients online. I thought, “If I can just figure this out, I can escape this grind.”

So I tried. For months. Cold outreach. Ads. Even paid “gurus.” Nothing clicked.

The turning point was realizing I didn’t need more tactics, I needed a system. A way to wake up and know exactly what to do to move my business forward.

Once I had that, everything changed. Within weeks, I booked my first calls, then my first client. For the first time, I could see a real way out of the 9–5.

Let me start with the positives:The resort is stunning. The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed. We loved the lazy river and water slides, and several staff members truly went above and beyond—special thanks to Eduardo (our coffee king in the mornings), Anyi at the main pool for 5-star service, and the consistently kind buffet hosts.
However, what should have been a relaxing family vacation quickly became one of the most emotionally exhausting trips we’ve ever taken.
As a light-skinned Puerto Rican woman married to a Black man, traveling with our multiracial family, we experienced an unacceptable number of microaggressions—not isolated incidents, but repeated moments that left us feeling excluded, unwelcome, and judged.
From the moment we arrived in the Dominican Republic (our transfer driver avoided us while serving others who arrived after us) to being ignored by restaurant staff while white families received attentive service, the pattern was painfully clear. My husband and kids were often overlooked or treated differently—and I have no doubt this treatment was racially motivated.
Even at the steakhouse, we were seated in the back by the bathrooms with only other Black families while white guests were given the better tables. At the pool, every family around us was invited to participate in games—except ours. It felt deliberate.
On top of that, the resort’s “Preferred Club” program creates a visible caste system. Certain guests are treated to luxury service and exclusive areas, while others are clearly second-tier, regardless of how much money they paid for their stay. We were never even offered the Preferred upgrade (even though it's low season), which, after everything else, felt like another layer of exclusion.
At breakfast we sat by that beach, the waiter served my husband and kids coffee and water, but when I arrived at the table, he ignored me for nearly 20 minutes. Meanwhile, he was very attentive to two white families sitting nearby. I brought these issues to buffet manager  and made it clear:  bias can ruin a vacation, no matter how beautiful the setting is.

This was the worst vacation of our lives, and sadly, we won’t return to this country or stay at a Hyatt property again. If you're traveling with a Black or multiracial family, I urge you to consider our experience.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

With Luis Gil (5.14 ERA) only having a handful of games under his belt this season, I think the underdog has a solid chance of running the show here. Gil’s only 3 starts have seen him accumulate 8 Earned Runs on 16 hits. In short: He hasn’t been great. On the other side, Lucas Giolito (3.63 ERA) has allowed 15 hits over his last 3 outings. With the Yankees offense being on a bit of a tear (they’ve scored 27 runs in just their last 3 games, cashing the Over in their last 4 straight…) I don’t doubt they’ll get more than a few on the board despite Giolito having a strong few outings. My money’s on the Over to hit today, friends.
