1gljz0s,https://i.redd.it/ci8ep8k68fzd1.jpeg,I lost 16 pounds of 272 hour fast in the last five weeks.,"Hello fellow fasters. Wanted to share an accomplishment. I’ve done a couple fast years back and I remember how good I felt but I haven’t been able to successfully complete one for years now. I know I needed to do something drastic to get back in shape and I was finally able to complete not one but two different fast over the course of five weeks.

I’m 45, 5’6 and I started out at 182 lbs.  I lost 10 lbs on the first 72 hour fast a few weeks back.  On the first day of fasting, I did a heavy cardio workout on my peloton bike. The second day I did a light workout and on the 3rd day I broke the fast at 72 hours.  I drank a ton of water, black coffee and some pinches of salt.  I ended up gaining a few pounds back to 175 over the next two weeks with good eating and exercise.

I decided to do another fast this last Monday. My goal was to go 120 hours but I didn’t make it. I did manage to get down to 167 pounds which I’m extremely proud of. Once again, I did a heavy workout on my peloton bike the first day with a light workout the second day and nothing the third and breaking my fast.  

The second fast was much easier than the first one.  It’s definitely mind control. But I feel great and I feel sharp and focused with a lot of extra energy. Additionally, I feel like my testosterone has improved as well.  Water, black coffee, some pinches of salt and I added some unmatched Electra this time which helped with my workouts.  

I must say fasting is kind of addicting when you see the quick results. I definitely just plan on managing my weight now and doing a 72 hr once a month if needed.  Excellent way to kickstart healthy habits!",2,1730959798.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

Halihó!

Gondolom mondanom sem kell, hogy a mai világban az elmagányosodás szinte népbetegség. Ugyan minden létező felületen vannak csoportok, posztok, fórumok, topikok amelyek a barátkereséssel foglalkoznak, de valljuk be: ritka ha valakinek sikerül így megtalálni a tökéletes embert.

Ugyan az íráskép és stílus sok mindent elárul egy illetőről, de még ennek ellenére is könnyen lehet, hogy a személyes találkozónál (már persze aki akar, mert ezt is előre kell manapság fixálni, hogy csak internet-bestit akar-e a másik fél vagy valós találkozásokat is) úgy érzik, hogy „lehet mégsem téged kerestelek”.

Szóval egy ideje elengedtem az ilyen formájú barátkeresgetést és bekövettem a képen látható két oldalt, akiknek a kezdeményezésüket elképesztően szupernek tartom. Úgy gondolom egy-egy ilyen kis női-beszélgetős összeülésből akár barátságok is születhetnek, főleg ha élőben látjuk egymást, szimpatizálunk és nem utolsó sorban az, hogy megjelenünk a programon, ami azt is jelenti, hogy van hajlandóságunk személyes kontaktra.

A bajom már csak az, hogy hol krónikus időhiányban szenvedek, hol pedig nem, és tudom, hogy ezzel más is így van. Tipikusan pedig pont akkor tudnék elmenni ezekre a programokra amikor pont hidegen hagy a téma ami köré építik. Emitt született meg ez a poszt, hogy olyan programsorozatokat gyártó tartalomkészítőket ajánljunk egymásnak, akik ilyen kezdeményezéseket csinálnak – mert talán akkor minden hozzám hasonló talál végre olyant, akinek pont akkor van pont jó témájú programja, amikor a csillagok is együttállnak.",1,1730959358.0,csakcsajok,0,0.67,False

1gljtwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gljtwb/im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police_department/,I’m A Rookie With The Winchester Police Department Supernatural’s Division: Demons Are Bullies,"Well, Halloween *sucked.* So much so, that it’s taken me a couple days to physically recover, but more on that later.

If you're confused, you can read my first case [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gfkkpn/im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police_department/)

I gotta be frank with ya, it felt like I was a chicken running around with its head cut off for most of the day. Being a rookie and working the busiest day of the year was not a fun experience.

And it definitely didn’t help that my Halloween started out on a pretty rough note. My barista asked me out on a date.

Yes, that’s a bad thing. I don’t *date.* Not since…

There’s this little coffee place by work that I liked to stop at before my shift- Conner’s Cafe. It’s quaint, cozy too, with a good rustic vibe going on and dim lighting. For some reason, it also reminded me of home. Chicago. Probably why I frequented there so much. That, and they gave me a good discount when I wore my blues.

The staff were all genuinely friendly and welcoming to me too. The coffee itself didn’t taste half bad either, so I quickly became a regular. Maybe a little too regular given the events that were about to occur.

The bell chimed above the door as I entered the shop. It was pretty empty in there. Gauging by the state the dining room was in, the morning rush had just cleared out, granting the employee’s a bit of respite before the inevitable lunch rush.

“He did it!” The barista manning the counter shouted at me with wide eyes, pointing to his co-worker behind him. I’d come in wearing my uniform.

The accused looked at me like a deer caught in headlights before dropping the stack of cups he’d been holding in his hands and booking it to the back.

A smile spread on my lips as a soft chortle escaped me. My cheeks pinked up immediately and I covered my mouth in embarrassment, giggling something fierce. The barista joined in with a hearty laugh as he bent down behind the counter and picked up the discarded cups.

The rabbit, his name is José. Don’t worry, he didn’t have any active warrants out for his arrest or anything, he just went out back to take his smoke break. Albeit in a very dramatic way.

The kid behind the counter was Noah. He was young, in his early twenties. He looked like an E-boy with his singular earring and that mop of curly brown hair atop his head, which usually covered up his brown eyes. In addition to his uniform green apron, Noah wore a headband with fuzzy wolf ears on them accompanied by a pair of fingerless gloves with paw pads drawn on the palms. Draped around his shoulders was a fake sheep’s pelt. He’d dressed up as a wolf in sheep’s clothing for his Halloween costume. *Clever.*

“Aren’t you going to get in trouble for wasting all those cups?” I asked, stepping up to the counter to order.

“Nah, it’s fine,” he answered, chucking them in the trash bin, wiping imaginary dust off his hands. “Our seasonal cups are about to come in anyway, so these ones won’t be missed. What can I get for ya, miss? The usual?”

“Yeah, but could you add two shots of espresso please? I’m going to need it.”

“Ooh four shots of expresso, huh, what’s the occasion?”

I covered my mouth, yawning. “I’m working a twelve hour shift today. Twelve to twelve.”

Noah pressed his lips into a thin line, sympathizing with me. “Oof, yikes. I’ll get that coffee right out for you then. Wouldn’t want you to be off your game today, officer.”

“Thanks Noah,” I called out to him as he walked over to the espresso machine, “‘preciate it!”

A second later, he came back, placing my large cup of steaming hot supercharged coffee on the counter. I went to pull out my wallet to pay, but Noah waved me off. “It’s on the house,” he said with a glimmer in his eye and a dopey grin.

I smiled back, shrugging my shoulders and picking up my drink, not saying no to a free coffee. That’s when I noticed something written in sharpie just above the paper sleeve. The note read: *Will you go out on a date with me?*

My gaze flashed from the cup, to Noah, then back to the cup again. He stood there patiently, smiling like a puppy, eagerly awaiting my response.

“Oh, uh,” I let out a nervous laugh, gripping the straps of my purse for dear life, “no.”

The smile fell off of Noah’s face as he looked down at me, heartbroken. I didn’t want to kick the puppy, but I had to.

“I-it’s not you,” I blurted out, awkwardly waving my hands at him. “You’re great, really. A little young, but great! What are you, like twenty, twenty-one? You’re like five years younger than me!” I sucked a gasping breath for air. “It me, that’s the problem. You don’t want to date me. All I do is hurt the people that get close to me. I don’t mean for it to happen, it just does. But, yeah Noah, you’re great. Awesome, even! Best barista I’ve ever had, truly.”

As you can see, I like to word vomit when I’m uncomfortable.

Not giving him any time to rebuttal, I whipped my wallet out of my purse and haphazardly threw a five dollar bill across the counter, then ran out the door- all while abandoning my coffee in the process.

Great. Now I can never go back and show my face there again. That’s what I get for getting too comfortable. Should’ve known my safe place wouldn’t stay safe for long, *stupid.*

Guess I’ll just have to suck it up and stick to a certain chain coffee shop with a mer-person on the logo.

Now that I’m thinking about it, is their mascot a mermaid or a siren?

*Ugh.* The thought of sirens sent a shiver down my spine.

My throat is feeling a lot better, by the way. It’s still stiff and is a little bruised, but at least I can fully turn my neck again. Being able to keep my head on a swivel is pretty vital for the job after all. Never know when something might jump out at ya.

When I got to the precinct, everyone on our side was bouncing off the walls it was so hectic. Officers were bringing people in left and right. Our holding cells were packed full, the intake line stretching across half the precinct. Every time someone answered the phone, dispatch had a new incident for them to respond to. And as soon as the phone hit the receiver it would just ring again.

I set my things down on my desk, eyeing the coffee machine like a hawk. If I were going to survive this shift, caffeine needed to be flowing through my veins. Since it was Halloween, we had no clue which calls *actually* pertained to the supernatural and which ones were just humans being human. So that meant we just had to respond to *all* of them.

As soon as I stepped towards the kitchen, Dustin appeared out from nowhere and dashed all my hopes of acquiring a pick me up. “Rookie!” He called, slipping an arm through his black police jacket. The other followed and he adjusted the fabric so it rested comfortably on his broad shoulders.“No time for dilly-dallying, get in the car. We got ghouls to catch!”

A hefty groan left my mouth. I shuffled my feet forward a couple inches, my hand outstretched towards my lord and savior: coffee. Dustin called out to me again, causing me to flinch. With another huff and groan, I turned away from the source of my vitality and followed Detective Davidson out to his vehicle. I knew then that it was going to be one of *those* days.

Dustin wasn’t lying by the way. We’d been called out to a report of someone at the graveyard disturbing the graves. The groundskeeper caught the perp as he was sucking the intestines out of an old woman who was about to be lowered into the ground. After hearing that, it wasn’t hard to figure out we were dealing with a ghoul.

We classify ghouls as a type of vampire since they feast on flesh and blood, but mostly of the dead variety. You can think of ‘em as vampiric zombies. The classification is mainly because ghouls die just the same as regular vampires. Decapitation works best in most cases, but a wooden stake to the heart could do the trick too.

Here at WPD the last thing we want to do is end the life of a supernatural individual. Just like for us humans, supernaturals have the right to go to trial and let The Court decide their fate. Though, we are extensively trained to neutralize any threat if absolutely necessary, especially if that threat poses immediate danger to a human life.

Unfortunately, it was looking like that would be the case for this ghoul.

The groundskeeper had managed to detain him, but not unscathed, sustaining a gnarly bite wound on his hand. That’s when he called Winchester 911 and asked for an officer out to help him.

Getting that taste of fresh blood was like a shot of adrenaline for the ghoul. If he got loose, there was a very real possibility he’d kill the groundskeeper and eat until there was nothing left. Once a ghoul eats a live victim, the dead just don’t taste as good to them anymore.

We got to the graveyard just in time. As Dustin and I left his car, weapons drawn, the ghoul escaped from the groundskeeper’s binds and was trying to strangle him to death. The ghoul was an older, redneck looking man. His skin was pale and caked in dirt, human tissues, and viscera. The smell of death radiated off him.

“Help me!” The groundskeeper called out to us in a choked gasp.

Not wasting any time, Dustin drew his crossbow and aimed a wooden stake at the ghouls heart. I tensed, the groundskeeper was keeping him from a clear shot. The stake whistled as it soared through the air. My eyes clenched shut.

They opened again when the ghoul let out a ghastly cackle. Dustin had missed, hesitating with the shot at the last second because of the groundskeeper’s position. The stake had landed in the bark of the oak tree behind them.

The ghoul laughed, tilting his head back and unloosening his jaw. Leaving his neck exposed as he prepared to take a bite out of his next victim. Thinking quickly, I grabbed the crossbow from Dustin and reloaded. A sharp breath withdrew from my chest as I squinted my eye and pulled the trigger. A stunned gargling noise came from the ghoul’s throat as a the wooden stake embedded itself into his trachea.

The ghoul released the groundskeeper in its state of confusion. Relieved, he ran far away from the redneck and towards Dustin. This left the creature wide open. I unsheathed the machete I’d brought and ran up to the ghoul as he clawed at the wooden stake in an attempt to remove it. I didn’t give him the chance to. I kicked the piece of wood deeper into his neck. The sound of his spine cracking rang out as he stumbled into the tree, right next to the stake Dustin had fired. The momentum of my next swing enabled the blade of the machete to slice through his neck in one smooth swoop.

The red neck’s body fell limp as the head landed on the ground with a wet *thump*!

“That’s what ya get for eating Mrs. Patty, bitch!” The groundskeeper laughed, dancing around the ghoul’s corpse. Dustin cleared his throat and shot a stern look at the groundskeeper. Feeling the chill of Dustin’s iconic icy cold glare, he stopped, a serious and more adult expression returning to his face.

“Not a word, got it?” Dustin commanded.

“Y-yes, sir. You don’t gotta worry about me,” he answered. Davidson gave the man a sturdy nod. The groundskeeper didn’t stay long and quickly skedaddled, leaving us to clean up the mess.

“Nice one, rookie,” he said proudly, patting me on the shoulder.

I gently slid his hand off of me. “Thanks.”

After dropping the ghoul’s body off at the morgue, we were called out to investigate reports of a supposed ghost terrorizing the elderly residents in a subdivision on the other side of town.

The perp wasn’t the ghost of an ancient serial killer like dispatch had advised, but a kid dressed in *very* convincing ghost makeup. I swear special fx makeup is on a whole other level these days, because when I first saw the kid I was convinced he was a real ghost too. His skin looked pale, glassy, and if I looked hard enough, translucent. The face makeup made his eyes look real sunken in and sickly.

Turns out the kid was going around tp’ing these individuals houses and banging on their windows because he had some sort of vendetta against them from last Halloween. Apparently, these old geezer’s had handed out raisins and vegetables instead of the good stuff.

Since the delinquent was so young, we let him off with a warning. The looming dread of his mom’s fury as she calmly talked over the phone was punishment enough.

Speaking of warnings, one of the calls we responded to was at the residence of one of the local witches. Her name’s Marge and she’s a real sweet old lady. Something really bad must’ve happened if we were called out to her place. Dispatch had told us that someone had apparently been transformed into a cat?

When Dustin and I pulled up, Marge was sitting on a rocking chair on her porch, arms crossed tightly in her chest. A teenage girl stood in the driveway crying, holding a razor scooter in one hand and a fuzzy black kitten in the other. In front of her lay another razor scooter and a pile of baggy men’s clothes. A giant bloody skid mark was left on the pavement.

“What happened here?” Dustin asked, trying hard to hide his amusement.

“That *witch* turned my brother into a cat!” The girl angrily screamed, seething at the old woman just chilling on her porch.

“What’s your side of the story, Marge?” I asked, treading carefully up towards the woman. I didn’t want to run the risk of upsetting her and getting whimsically transformed into an animal like other the kid did.

Marge pressed her lips into a thin line and started rocking. She looked down at the blood stain solemnly. “He ran over my familiar with that damned scooter. It’s only fair he takes its place.”

After hearing both sides of the story and deliberating on what to do, we let both parties off with a warning. The boy’s sister wasn’t very happy that her brother wouldn’t be returning home, but I had to explain to her the grave mistake her brother had made by killing the witch’s familiar, even if it had been an accident.

She stormed off, learning a valuable lesson in that the next time she rides her scooter to be careful of her surroundings. Otherwise she might just find herself with new feline features.

As for Marge, Dustin allowed her to keep the  boy as her familiar, but warned that next time she’d have to go through the department and get a permit first. If she didn’t acquire one, we’d have to come and take them away, which nobody wanted.

We’d just gotten back into the liftback when we were summoned once more.

“Uh, could we get someone out here with us? This is turning out to be a bit more than we can handle,” Unit 217 called out over the radio.

Dustin and I checked their location on our map. We were the closest ones to them in the area. I looked at him, my eyes pleading for a break. We’d been responding to call after call for the better part of seven hours by then. I still hadn’t had a cup of coffee and something in my gut told me this one was going to be a doozy. He just smirked and shrugged his shoulders.

Asshole.

Dustin reached for the radio on the dashboard. “380 to 217. 10-4, can you give us a little more information? Let us know what we’re walking into.”

“217 to 380. We responded to a domestic dispute call and have the husband detained in the bedroom, but it’s gotten pretty weird over here. There’s something *wrong* with this guy. We need backup, just in case.”

Dustin let out a sigh and shot me an annoyed look.

“Told you,” I mouthed, sassily.

He rolled his eyes at me before responding back, “Standby, we’re on our way.”

When we arrived at the house, the sun was just setting beneath the horizon. Trick-or-treaters were out in full swing. Nosey kids and parents watched as Dustin and I met with the officers in Unit 217 on the porch.

An angry yell sounded from somewhere within the residence, the lights out on the porch flickered in response. A blonde middle aged woman came out from the open front doorway. She looked distraught and on the edge of tears. Her cheek was bruised, her upper lip was busted, and strangulation marks lined her neck.

“We’re so glad you’re here,” 217 said as the woman looked at them, pleadingly.

“You guys are good to go. We got it from here,”Dustin said, dismissing our counterparts. He shot me a glance, using his eyes to ask me if I was thinking what he was thinking.

The slight smell of rotten eggs clung in the air and the lights flickered again. Sharply, I nodded my head.

Unit 217 looked relieved as they retreated back to their patrol car. Two hardened and experienced cops like that looking so scared made me uneasy.

Of course we’d get stuck dealing with a demon of all things on Halloween, the one night a year where they’re at their strongest.

The girl introduced herself as Ginger Farley, the wife of the man 217 had detained inside. Harlen Farley. She’d called 911 after managing to lock herself in their bathroom before he could beat her to death.

Ginger initially flinched away when I reached out a supportive hand. After flashing her a sympathetic smile, knowing all too well what she was going through, she let me gently rub her shoulder comfortingly. “Can you show us where your husband is, Ginger? We’d like to check on his condition.”

“H-here,” she answered, shakily, “in the bedroom.” Ginger shot Dustin a weary glance and fiddled with her hands nervously, still blocking the doorway. Given the situation, it was normal for her to be feeling intimidated and scared by another male’s presence.

I stepped in front of Dustin and nodded, reassuring Ginger that she wasn’t alone and I’d be there to protect her. Hesitantly, she stumbled deeper into the house, still a little disoriented from her encounter.

The Farley house was a quaint one story ranch with a wrap around porch. The inside looked frozen in time, stuck in the 1970s. Dream catchers hung from the walls and hippie paraphernalia lined the shelves. A groovy Indian blanket was draped over a tan leather couch in the living room. The broken remains of a bong littered the floor, an overturned coffee table accompanying it.

Ginger slowly followed the path of destruction leading from ground-zero in the living room, through a short hallway, and into the master bedroom.

As we passed through the door, an overwhelmingly dark and overpowering aura filled the room. It was suffocating.

“Look what the whore dragged in!” A sickly looking man called from the bed with a wheezing laugh. He’d been handcuffed to the  bed frame of the couple’s water bed, one hand outstretched to each side. Yup, a friggen water bed. He sat spread eagle making it even harder not to laugh. The sight was so bizarre. Guess that’s Halloween for you.

Dustin and I shot each other curious glances. “Promising,” he muttered to himself, rubbing his thumb on his chin. Without proper confirmation, we had to operate under the assumption this man was himself and not under any sort of supernatural influence. Even with the signs we had observed, more tests needed to be conducted.

Us in the Supernatural’s Division rarely come across demon possession cases, and when we do, our job is to make sure what we’re dealing with is in fact a demon and not a really strong poltergeist or something else. After a positive ID is made, procedure states we wait with the possessed victim until we can get a priest out for an exorcism.

Dustin pulled out his emergency vial of holy water and started flicking water all over the potentially possessed man. Ginger stared at him dumbfounded. We hadn’t told her what we thought we were dealing with.

“Oh ow, no stop, that hurts,”Harlan said sarcastically in a mock whining tone as the water hit his skin. He then burped, the stench of sulfur emanating from his mouth. Though he was acting all tough, his skin had become red and irritated. And if you listened close enough faint sizzling could be heard.

Dustin made a non-committal noise as he pulled out his field notebook and started taking notes. I was just about to walk out and retrieve our state issued Holy Book and cross from his trunk when Harlan scoffed, tugging on his handcuffs, becoming clearly agitated. “You’re one of *them* kind of police officers, huh?” He asked, trying to sit up. He sounded annoyed.

Harlan then turned his head and looked directly into his wife’s soul. With a blink, the sclera in his eyes disappeared as his pupils blew up, leaving nothing but inky blackness. “Is this what you wanted to see, officer?”

“What the hell?!” Ginger screamed, grabbing onto my arm and squeezing the life out of it. The demon possessing Harlan let out a particularly nasty laugh, sounding like multiple voices talking at the same time.

Talking with our eyes again, Dustin gave me the go ahead to speak with her outside the room while he made the proper arrangements for her husband.

In the hallway, I endured a round of Ginger’s frantic questioning before conducting an impromptu interview of my own.

“T-two weeks ago, Harlan lost his job at the factory,” she began after I’d asked when she first noticed a change in Harlan’s behavior,” being replaced by a cheaper and more efficient automated system crushed him. He didn’t cope with it well, turned to the bottle instead of me. Harlan was real down, depressed and angry. So angry. He’s been going to the bar every night and a couple days ago he came back *darker*. He hasn’t been himself since. Then today-“ her voice hitched in her throat, causing her to pause. “Now it’s all starting to make sense…”

I grabbed Ginger’s hand and gently guided her back into the living room, kicking the broken glass and debris aside for her. She stifled a sob as she sat on the couch.

“Why don’t you stay out here for a while?” I proposed, sitting down next to her. “It’ll be safer this way.” With a tearful nod, Ginger agreed.

“Where’s the skank?” The demon asked as I re-entered the bedroom alone.

“Away, safe from you,” I answered, crossing my arms into my chest, leaning against one of the walls.

He scoffed, jerking his head my way. One of the bedside lamps flew across the nightstand, shattering into bits right by my feet. I stifled a jump by pretending to yawn, trying to show him he didn’t scare me.

“So, ya gotta name, demon?” Dustin asked, rolling up his sleeves, making himself comfortable. It was All-Hallows Eve, that meant we were going to be waiting a while for an exorcist to show up.

The possessed man spat at his feet, causing the waterbed to jiggle furiously. He laughed, “Not one that I’ll tell you!”

My partner did not look as amused. “Demon Dan it is, then.”

Demon Dan shrugged his shoulders, taking a liking to the name. Then, without warning, Dan turned his head towards me.   “Lucyyyyyy\~ you’re a bad girl aren’t you? A *very* bad girl!”

“H-how did you-“

“I’m a demon, girl, it’s my job to know these things!” Demon Dan hissed. He jerked his head back towards Dustin, yanking on his restraints harshly. “Dusty-boy, do you wanna know how she got her nickname?”

He shot me a nervous glance.

Dan then sang, “It’s because she’s lucky, *lucky to be alive!*”

“Hale, what’s he talking about?” Dustin asked, looking back and forth between us frantically.

“D-don’t listen to him, he’s a demon. He’s trying to get inside our heads!” I reminded Dustin.

In a panic, he retrieved his vial of holy water once more, dumping it over the demon. Small streams of smoke billowed off his skin. “You’re getting too rowdy for my liking. This outta shut you up for a while.”

A horrific wail escaped from Demon Dan as he violently convulsed. After a couple minutes of agonized gasps and groans, he seemingly settled down.

“Okay,” he said breathlessly in a serious tone as his eyes went dark, “playtime’s over.” A harsh metallic groan filled the room as Demon Dan broke through his handcuffs like they were nothing.

“Shit,” Dustin mumbled, stumbling back.

I pushed myself off the wall, looking around for anything that could be used as a weapon. I kicked myself for not getting the Bible and cross out of the car earlier. In his fit, Dustin had depleted his holy water supply, leaving us virtually unprotected.

“Why don’t you write this down for your little report, detective?” Demon Dan cackled as his back arched as an invisible force helped him slowly rise to his feet. Then, with a spectacular supernaturally aided jump, he clung to the ceiling like a cat. The sound of his feet padding around filled the room as he crawled around erratically.

“Me and this meat sack made a deal the other night,” with one hand still holding onto the ceiling, Dan brought the other down to his cheek, rotating it as he pouted his lip and mockingly cried. “He wanted to make sure his miss’s would be well taken care of.”

“So you possessed him?” I questioned.

Demon Dan smiled delightfully. “Did you know that Mr. Farley’s life insurance policy is worth one million dollars? He sure didn’t!”

Dustin bid in, “what does that have to do with possession?”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Dan chuckled. “This coward would never end his life on his own. He needs someone else to do it for him! So, in exchange for a fun time with his wife, I would make sure she’d be set for life. Now it’s my turn to fulfill my end of the deal. Why don’t you say hi buddy, before you go?”

“No! No, no, no, please!” Harlan cried out, eyes going wide. Without Dan in control, he fell from the ceiling back first onto the hardwood flooring. A pained cry came from the man as many of his bones broke upon impact.

Ginger’s screams filled the house. Dustin and I turned around to find she had been peeking through the bedroom’s door, watching this whole catastrophe unfold. Seeing her broken husband’s dying body was enough to send her flying out of the house.

A gurgling sound came from Harlan’s throat as he coughed up blood. After the sound continued for a minute, I recognized it as a sinister chuckle. His eyes flickered from normal to pure black. Dan looked up at me and frowned. Harlan’s neck then snapped as it twisted to an unnatural angle, the frown turning into a sick smile. He flashed his blood red stained teeth. “There is no Heaven! There is no Hell! There is only darkness! Praise The Harbinger of Doom for they will bring darkness to us all!” He cryptically cried out with one final huff.

Demon Dan seemed to have left his host after that, leaving Harlan lying there broken and alone as he breathed his final breath, the light draining from his eyes.

We’d lost him.

“Fuck!” I shouted angrily, kicking the waterbed’s frame, causing the mattress to slosh around. I hadn’t wanted to go to the morgue for a second time that day.

Dustin tried to put a comforting hand on me, but I pushed him away. After letting me stew in self-pity for a moment, he told me to wait in the car. He’d call and cancel the priest and take care of the body.

After closing Harlan’s sheet covered body in the trunk of his car, Dustin drove us back to the precinct. The air was thick and heavy with tension. Something felt off. *Different.*

I confronted him about an hour before our shift was supposed to end. We’d been walking past the holding cells on our way to turn in the night’s paperwork. Passing by the last cell with its strategically opened door, I suddenly pushed my partner in. The door slammed shut behind him before he could even comprehend what was going on.

“Lucky? What the hell?” Dustin questioned, gripping and pulling on the silver bars frantically.

I stepped back cautiously.

He pushed and pulled even harder, staring at me like a caged animal. His look of shock turned into one of anger. In a rage he shouted, “What’s going on? Why am I in here?!”

My head turned away, unable to look at him. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything.

The rattling stopped. Then a beat. I forced myself to look at him. The pissed off look dissipated, leaving behind that same creepy grin I’d seen at the Farley house.

“Oops! Ya caught me!” Demon Dan giggled out, dropping the act. His eyes became two black abyss’s as the demon showed himself.

“Why are you possessing him?” I interrogated, my emotions enabling me to take a demanding step forward.

He shrugged his shoulders. “What can I say? I like it when you get all irritated and fired up.”

“You’re a bully,” I scoffed, tucking a stray piece of black hair back behind my ear, addressing the comment.

Dan bellowed out a laugh as if I said the funniest thing in the world. “No, I’m a demon, sweetheart. There’s a difference.”

“And why were you being so open about your intentions earlier?” I asked, changing the subject, “What did you have to gain from all that?”

Dustin’s eyes narrowed as he leaned his shoulder against the cell’s bars. “Nothing. I was just bored and you two were taking forever. I did find what I was looking for though, thanks for that.”

“Good, so you can leave.”

Demon Dan chuckled, crossing his arms into his chest defiantly. “And what if I don’t wanna?” He challenged.

I narrowed my eyes and seethed at the demon. “Get out of my partner, *now*,” I commanded. A strange feeling surged through my body then, causing my balance to falter just a bit.

The thing puppeteering Dustin’s body stepped back, holding his hands up defensively. “Whatever you say officer\~” he said with a smirk, flashing those black sclera-less eyes one last time. “See you later, toots.”

An evil laugh erupted out of Dustin’s throat as tears started to flow from his eyes. Then, in an instant, he stopped. His eyes were his again. “Hale, why am I in a cell?” He asked, confused.

“You were possessed,” I answered, opening the cell door for him. “Still might be.”

Then an intense wave of weakness and nausea overcame me. With the excitement of the day’s events over, the lack of caffeine and exhaustion had caught up with me. I stumbled to the ground, promptly passing out. My body felt like it was floating in water as my mind went blank.

I woke up lying on two office chairs that had been pushed together as a makeshift cot. Dustin was holding an ice pack up to my forehead, a thermometer sticking out of my mouth.

“Glad to see you’re back,” he chuckled after I spat the thermometer out and threw the ice pack on the floor. I gave Dustin the middle finger before he helped me up to my feet.

The fluorescent glow of the precinct’s overhead lights started giving me a headache. “What time is it?”

“Don’t worry, Halloween is over. And so is your shift,” Detective Davidson said as he helped me out to the parking lot. Outside, the early wisps of sunlight peeked above the horizon as birds started to chirp signaling the beginning of their hunt for worms.

Despite my protest, Dustin wouldn’t let me drive home. I kept reassuring him I was fine but he was not having it. With a promise to return my car to me, I reluctantly let him take me home.

Then that snitch told the Lieutenant about my fainting spell. I received an apologetic phone call from him, saying he felt bad to have forced me to come back to work so soon. Lieutenant Dawn then ordered me to take a mandatory week of leave to fully recover. He hung up before I could respond.

Today has been the first day I’ve truly felt able to do something since Halloween. I’ve expended most of my energy typing this out, but here’s my report for ya. And yes, of course I’ll keep you guys updated on what happens when I return back to the force.

Armchairs, in particular, are a staple for any cozy corner, whether it’s a reading nook, a quiet space for unwinding, or a stylish accent in a small living room. This guide explores some of the best armchairs to consider if you’re short on space but big on style, comfort, and functionality.

**1. Compact Armchairs with Maximum Comfort**

In Dubai’s bustling cityscape, where apartments are often on the cozier side, finding an [armchair Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) locals can enjoy without compromising space is key. Opt for armchairs designed with sleek, compact dimensions but thick cushions and ergonomic backrests for ultimate relaxation. Many models combine slim frames with padded seats, giving you the perfect blend of comfort and space efficiency.

**Top Picks:**

**The Slim Profile Chair:** With a narrow base and slightly elevated legs, these chairs give the illusion of more space while still providing ample seating comfort.

**Mid-Century Modern Armchair:** These designs often have tapered legs and a minimalist form, making them ideal for smaller areas without sacrificing visual appeal.

**2. Versatile Small Armchairs for Every Space**

A [small armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) can fit into various parts of your home, offering flexibility in tight quarters. Look for armless designs or chairs with shorter, angled legs that create the appearance of more space. These armchairs can work as accent pieces in the living room, next to a coffee table, or even in a bedroom corner.

**Top Picks:**

**The Armless Chair:** No arms mean more space to maneuver, making it easier to fit into corners or tight spaces.

**The Swivel Armchair:** Perfect for multifunctional spaces, these chairs can rotate to face different areas, maximizing usability without requiring extra floor space.

**3. Outdoor Armchairs for Cozy Balconies and Patios**

For those with outdoor areas, an [outdoor armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/seating/outdoor-armchairs) that complements your small balcony or patio is essential. In Dubai, where outdoor living is part of the lifestyle, choosing a weather-resistant yet comfortable chair can enhance your relaxation experience. Opt for materials like rattan or metal with soft, removable cushions for easy cleaning.

**Top Picks:**

**Foldable Outdoor Armchairs:** Easy to store when not in use, these are great for balconies or terraces that need to be flexible.

**Rattan Armchair with Cushion:** Weather-resistant rattan with cozy, plush cushions offers the best of both style and durability for outdoor spaces.

**4. Functional Storage Armchairs for Small Homes**

For small spaces, multifunctional furniture is a game-changer. Some armchairs come with built-in storage, ideal for keeping magazines, remotes, or blankets tucked away without adding extra furniture. Look for pieces with subtle drawers or compartments under the seat to save space efficiently.

**Top Picks:**

**Storage Ottoman Armchair:** These chairs feature storage under a cushioned seat, offering a comfortable and practical solution.

**Convertible Armchair with Shelf Storage:** Some models have shelving units incorporated into the armrests or back, combining seating with a compact storage solution.

**5. Choosing the Right Fabric and Colors**

In compact spaces, choosing the right fabric and colors for your armchair can make a significant difference. Lighter hues like cream, beige, or soft pastels can brighten the room, giving it a more open feel. However, for an outdoor armchair, consider darker, UV-resistant fabrics to withstand Dubai’s sunny climate.

**Final Thoughts**

Whether you're looking for a small armchair for your cozy apartment or an outdoor armchair to complement your balcony setup, there are plenty of options that provide comfort without compromise. Small spaces deserve big comfort, and with the right armchair, you can turn any corner into a personal retreat.",1,1730958361.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

**Conditions:** Spring. Generally between 50–73°F (10–23°C). Lowest temp around 36°F (2°C) and hottest around 90°F (32°C). Mostly dry and fairly cloudy, with significant rain once.

**Previous trip reports:**

Tom's website ([The Adventure Gene](https://theadventuregene.com/bibbulmun-fkt-trip-report/)) is the repository of so much Bibbulmun info it's crazy. Thanks so much.

There's also the report by fellow PCT '24er[ Bumps](https://www.reddit.com/r/UltralightAus/comments/ihkk25/my_44day_e2e_s2n_walk_on_the_bibbulmun_track_in/) from a while ago in a different season (autumn).

**Introduction/Summary:**

It feels a bit odd writing a report for this subreddit when my starting pack weight was about 42 lbs (19 kg). I felt far from ultralight but ended up eating my way down to my base weight of 8.3 lbs (3.7 kg) and used everything except some repair/emergency items. So it was a hike in the philosophical ultralight vein. Although my legs perhaps didn't appreciate this distinction.

The Bibbulmun Track is a long trail located in southwestern Australia. I had completed the hike in a more leisurely manner the previous year and would have called it well-graded then, but my opinion on this has now shifted. It is though well marked and well maintained. The trail goes through open Marri/Jarrah woodland, scrubby plains, majestic Karri forests and finally the southern coast.

In a fit of delusion I decided to attempt to walk the trail fully “unsupported”. From the FKT guidelines: “*Unsupported means you truly have no external support of any kind. You must carry everything you need from start to finish except water from natural sources. Public taps along the trail are fine, but no water from any commercial source even if free*.” The main challenge obviously being the 620 odd miles of food I’d have to carry. Resupplying in any way being against the rules. This sadly included any town food or coffee. 620 miles of food can be as many days as you decide, but it is a trade off between going longer and lighter or shorter and heavier. I decided I didn't want to carry more than 17 days of food and the entailed pace was not too impossible, and so that became my goal.

So far as I know this is the first completion of this trail in an unsupported style. I found it very challenging to say the least and I barely enjoyed any of it. The hardest hike I’ve done by a long shot. My cushy ultralight life hadn’t prepared me for the weight and crushing impact of the heavy pack. It took its toll on my body from the get go and I was just trying to hold on till the end. My mantra was: ""tomorrow is a lighter day"".

I met a lot of people who hike regularly with this pack weight which I find insane and definitely vindicated the ultralight style of hiking for me. I would not enjoy hiking anywhere near as much if that was my regular weight. 

I was realistically pessimistic about my chances of completing the trail. I thought the most likely outcome would be pulling out due to injury on day 4 or 5. I did have a reasonable base of hiking fitness, having done the TA, Bibbulmun and PCT within the last two years. But I still struggled physically. I did get several injuries, the most serious on day 3, but they were all minor enough and manageable enough to allow me to continue onwards, albeit carefully.

Hiking the Bibbulmun unsupported required a lot of planning and preparation. Wild/free camping along the trail is not permitted sporadically for roughly half its length. The only permissible areas for wild camping are basically State Parks that are also outside of drinking water catchment areas. Towns are also out for the unsupported hiker as paying for anything, including accommodation or camping is not allowed. I had made a schedule that threaded the needle so to speak and pretty much stuck to it. Preparing all the food was a massive task. Being local, I cooked and dehydrated all my dinners which I cold soaked on the trail. It was well worth the effort. I nailed the food so I was never hungry and finished my last snack 4 miles from the finish. 

**The Report:** 

I’ve written a longer narrative style trip report with photos here: [Long report](https://www.marleybutler.com/hiking-trips/bibbulmunfkt). 

When I wrote it I was fresh off the trail (although fresh is not the word I'd have used at the time) and I go into the day by day, how I was feeling, how bad my sleep was, the ant invasion of Day 4, why Day 7 was my worst day on trail etc.

There is also a short summary I included in the FKT submission you can read here: [Fastest Known Time](https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/marley-butler-bibbulmun-track-2024-10-30). 

As part of the FKT submission I included tracking from my watch which updated my location every second, although they didn't include the files in their reporting. So there was no short cutting or quietly making my way to a café. Although there is always a level of trust and honesty involved in these things. 

The stats for each day I’ll list below, taken from my gps watch. The pack weights are estimates based on the food I allotted to each day - I didn't have a set of scales on me.

Day - Distance, total elapsed time (hr:mm), elevation gain, starting total pack weight for the day

Day 17: 39.1 miles (63.0 km), 14:46, 4,232 ft (1,290 m), 10.4 lbs (4.7 kg)

  
**Final thoughts**

I don't really know how to conclude. It was tough. There were nice moments but it kinda just sucked. I reached new lows but asymmetrically didn't get close to new highs. Except maybe finishing. It was cool breaking new ground for the trail, doing something ambitious and challenging, something no one had done before and I am proud of the achievement for sure. But I'm looking forward to enjoying the next hike.



**Gear Notes:** 

See[ Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/p5xptz) for weights and the full list.

I went ultralight on everything except my sleeping system, intending to rely heavily on getting good sleep and recovery overnight. I ended up sleeping like trash for the first 10 nights due to having too much muscle pain to capitalise on my sleeping windows, but the strategy I think was sound. The pack also was about twice as heavy as I'd usually carry but this was a necessity as far as I am concerned given my starting weight.

*Pack*

The SWD Long Haul carries like a beast. I taped my hip area before the hike because I knew it would rub with the heavy weight. But other than that it worked perfectly. The ultra x has massively delaminated internally even before this hike, from the PCT, but that’s just what happens after about 2,000 miles with ultra I find (including the new x variant). The pack now has 3000+ miles on it and is going strong otherwise. I borrowed this pack from a mate I hiked with on the PCT, I would find it overkill for most other trips. For this though, it was the perfect weapon.

*Shelter*

There are 3-walled AT style shelters every 12 miles or so on the trail and some UL hikers opt to forego any shelter. I decided to take a shelter mainly to allow me to wild camp in those areas where it is allowed so I could more closely hike the distances I wanted to. There were also a couple of locations where shelters weren’t available and pushing on 12 miles due to weather would have been heinous on this hike. 

The tarp was great, pitched well, and kept me dry the few times it rained overnight. It measures approximately 9.7 feet (2.95 m) long and 7.2 to 5.2 feet (2.2 to 1.6 m) wide, with a cat-cut, tapered A-frame design that is slightly hexagonal. I had made a couple of these by now and barely refined the design. I went with 0.51 DCF for the weight savings. The Lineloc V from Zpacks held the 1.2 mm cord well but they weren’t tested by any high winds. There are several photos on the longer report I've linked above. 

My half bug net bivy idea worked well for the last third of the hike when my body heat output wasn’t as high overnight. At the start it was too hard to regulate my temperate and keep my metabolically blazing legs cool. The system relied on my legs being inside my quilt for mosquito protection. When I was too hot I had no way of cooling them down. Moving the down in my quilt didn’t cut it. It also doesn’t protect from ant attack which would have saved me from the invasion the morning of day 4. I should have just copped the extra 2 oz or so and made a fully enclosed bivy. Maybe not the hike to experiment on in hindsight.

*Sleep system*

I used a regular wide x-lite and a pillow I used to sleep with at home but cut down to a much smaller size. I am very particular when it comes to sleep systems. Using this system I generally sleep solidly the entire night without waking. It is a heavy setup but I thought the good sleep would be worth it. That didn't pan out but I imagine sleeping on a 1/8"" torso length mat with a sock as a pillow would have been even worse. I've tried heaps of inflatable pillows and car washing sponges etc. They sadly don't work for me. I’m a precious pea.

*Quilt*

I went with an EE 40 F enclosed footbox quilt. I usually go for a zippered footbox but the weight savings swayed me. The quilt was essentially part of my shelter too so I couldn't be opening the footbox regardless. Closed footboxes are just too hot for me and not good enough at regulating temperature. My shoulders usually get cold well before my legs and feet. Maybe with a full bug bivy I could have made it work better but the zippered footbox remains my strong preference. I was cold in the morning a couple of times, mostly my fault though. The quilt kept me warm when it was above or at 5 C

*Insulation*

For warmth I took a pair of fleece glove liners and a versalite rain jacket. I was cold once when an unseasonable cold front came through but otherwise was warm in the mild conditions I hiked in. Except for that front, I probably would have been fine carrying a wind jacket with a new coating of DWR. I would have used a fleece once, so I was glad to have left it behind. 

*Shoes*

After a lot of consideration I went with Altra Olympus 6’s. The last pair I had worn for over 620 miles so I knew they would at least last the distance. The other shoe I was considering was the Hoka Speedgoat in wide. Overall I like these shoes better, but the toe box is not wide enough and I eventually get toe blisters from the wedge shape, something I’ve never got in an Altra. Someone please put the toe box of an Altra on the Speedgoat. The Olympus aren’t perfect. The new heel cup on this model is an odd choice and an immediate source of abrasion on my skin. I taped my heels occasionally to avoid blisters but eventually got one on the last day. Sandy terrain probably didn't help. They also wear weirdly at the bending point on the outside of the footpad area which makes it super abrasive here. My socks were getting chewed up by this on my last pair so I was having to tape my socks after about 300 miles to avoid the same fate. Actually I was having to reapply the leuko tape to my socks as the tape itself wore through.

With styles ranging from rustic to modern, bar stools offer creative ways to enhance various spaces around your home. Whether you’re considering [bar stools Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) or looking for unique [outdoor stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/seating/outdoor-stools), here are some inventive ideas to incorporate bar stools in unexpected spaces.

**1. Home Office Helper**

Use bar stools to transform your home office into a dynamic and functional workspace. Bar stools with adjustable heights work well at standing desks or tall tables, creating a casual yet efficient work environment. This setup promotes better posture and can be a refreshing change from traditional office chairs. Look for stylish yet supportive bar stools in Dubai to add sophistication and practicality to your home office.

**2. Entryway Elevation**

The entryway is the first area guests see, so why not make it stylish and functional? Place a bar stool or two near the entryway for a quick seat when you need to put on shoes or set down bags. This touch of seating provides a warm, welcoming feel while enhancing your entryway’s style. Choose bar stools that complement the decor—think sleek, metal stools for modern spaces or wooden stools for a rustic look.

**3. Bedroom Vanity Seating**

For a stylish take on vanity seating, bar stools make a chic and space-efficient alternative to traditional vanity chairs. Opt for bar stools with cushioned seating or backrests for extra comfort. This unique choice will not only save space but add a sophisticated edge to your bedroom. Bar stools in Dubai offer a range of designs that blend well with various bedroom themes, from minimalist to luxurious.

**4. Living Room Accent**

In a living room, bar stools can be used as extra seating or even as small side tables. They’re perfect for creating a casual, social atmosphere where friends and family can gather. Consider placing a couple of outdoor stools by the window or around a coffee table to encourage conversation and relaxation. Outdoor bar stools are durable and versatile, blending style with functionality in your living space.

**5. Outdoor Seating Oasis**

Outdoor stools are ideal for creating a comfortable seating area on a balcony, patio, or garden. You can arrange bar stools around a tall table or use them individually as stand-alone seats for a casual vibe. Weather-resistant outdoor bar stools in Dubai make it easy to style a chic outdoor space, whether you’re enjoying a sunset view or hosting a barbecue.

**6. Kids’ Craft Station**

Bar stools are an excellent addition to a kids’ craft station. Their height makes it easy for children to access all parts of the table, while their style adds a playful element to the space. Choose sturdy bar stools with wipeable surfaces for easy cleaning. This setup encourages creativity in a dedicated, accessible area that can be easily adapted as kids grow.

**7. Walk-In Closet Convenience**

In a walk-in closet, a bar stool provides a quick seat for trying on shoes or setting down accessories. It’s a small addition that makes a big difference, adding a hint of luxury and practicality to your dressing space. Choose a sleek bar stool with a small footprint to ensure it fits seamlessly in your closet.

**8. Dining Room Sidekick**

Even if your dining area has traditional chairs, adding a few bar stools at the ends of the table or against a wall can provide extra seating and enhance the room’s decor. This approach works well for casual gatherings or when you need additional seating without crowding the table. Look for bar stools in Dubai that match or complement your dining chairs for a cohesive look.

**9. Stylish Plant Stands**

For plant lovers, bar stools make excellent plant stands, adding height and dimension to your greenery display. Choose outdoor stools for durability, especially if placing plants outside or near a window with strong sunlight. The added height from bar stools can make your plants the focal point of any room, bringing a touch of nature into your home.

**10. Multi-functional Playroom**

In a playroom, bar stools can double as seating and as props for imaginative play. They’re easy to move around and can be used in creative ways, from pretend stages to snack seating. Look for lightweight, durable bar stools that are safe and easy to maneuver for kids.

**Conclusion**

Bar stools have evolved beyond their traditional roles, becoming versatile pieces that can enhance spaces throughout your home. From home offices to entryways, there are numerous ways to creatively incorporate bar stools in Dubai. By reimagining their use, you can add style, function, and flair to your living spaces. Whether you’re looking for bar stools, outdoor stools, or modern designs, these pieces offer endless possibilities for transforming your home.",1,1730957606.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I felt better again less anxiety, I was able to drink coffee. This lasted for about a weekend until my new psychiatrist upped from 20mg to 30mg. 
So currently it’s been about a week and a half on 30mg and I’m considering going back down to 20mg. I have never felt this hopeless and anxious in my life, it feels like I’m always 24/7 tapering the line of an anxiety attack. Is it worth it to push through?

1glj6uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/1glj6uy/i_wrote_a_story_years_ago_that_seems_applicable/,I wrote a story years ago that seems applicable today:,"The two most important words in the English language are, “Why,” and, “How.”


When answered honestly, these questions have served to progress humanity greatly. The answers can be simple or complex, but eventually they all end the same.


A child wants McDonalds for dinner. Their mother says no. The child replies, “Why?”


Well, because we had McDonalds yesterday, and two days in a row is too much.

“Why?”


Well, because McDonalds is not healthy for you, and having it multiple times a week is only for emergencies.

“Why?”


Because sometimes we don’t have enough time, or money, or energy to cook a full meal at home, so we’ll go out and get you McDonalds instead, even though it’s not healthy.

“Why?”


Because both I and your other parent work our jobs to pay all our bills.

“Why?”


Because only one of us having a job isn’t enough, so both of us need to work in order to provide enough money to keep all of us alive.

“Why?”


Because if we stop working, we die. We would run out of money within a month or two, and we wouldn’t have any more food at all, McDonalds or not.

“Why?”


Because that is the system that we currently live in in the United States. There is no food for individuals who are no longer able to generate profit.

“Why?”


Because currently in the United States, after years of work by people in power, it has become widely accepted by the public that if you are unable to generate profit you are bad in some way. You’re either lazy, or entitled, or a bum, even though what you do may make the world a better place. You could be a painter or a musician, or maybe you don’t do anything! But if you don’t generate some kind of profit for the class of people above you, you are actively discriminated against.

“Why?”


Because those wealthy people in the class above you need us to keep working. If we stop, they begin to lose all of their money and power. So, to keep us motivated, they hoard things like food, access to healthcare, and the ability for us to generate these things for ourselves.

“Why?”


Because if you’re hungry, sick, or generally in pain, you’re going to do whatever you can in order to make that pain stop. If that means working 40+ hours every week for a minimum wage job, then that’s what people will do.

“Why?”


Because the system was designed to function in that way. It works by having individuals at the top of the pyramid who are able to distribute the workload over many people at the bottom of the pyramid while still retaining all of the profits for themselves.

“Why?”


Well, some people say that it’s because people are inherently greedy, but I don’t think that’s true, because people in this bottom class try their best to look out for each other. We set up mutual aid networks, giving people food and medicine and trying our best to keep everyone safe.

“Why?”


Because we’re all in the same storm together. It is hard for me, but it’s hard for the barista at that coffee shop, the handyman working to fix my plumbing, the teachers at your school, the bartender downtown, and the sanitation workers who keep everything clean for us. Everybody has a big role to play in the community, even artists and musicians, providing us with the beauty that makes life worth living.

“Why?”


Because communities are built on people. Each one of us is unhappy, filled with doubt and fear, anger and remorse, apathy and misery. We try our best to put on smiles every day and ignore all of the terrible things which are happening in the world, but sometimes that gets really hard. It’s easier to survive when everyone is able to work together.

“Why?”


Because relying on someone else is important to them and you. Giving someone a reason to get out of bed in the morning is just as good as getting a reason to get out of bed from someone else. We all suffer, it’s true, but we don’t have to suffer alone, and we don’t have to suffer for long.

“Why?”


Because things are changing. People are beginning to ask questions about things like McDonalds and recognizing that all of these problems go back to the same root. People are getting upset because they’re recognizing their futures aren’t going to be what they thought they would be.

“Why?”


Because we were raised to live in a world that no longer exists.

“Why?”


Because that world is one of sparkling ideals for the future that have been twisted by the greed of that upper class. Our parents told us that we could be anything we wanted, that we could get a good job and earn lots of money, and that no matter what, hard work would pay off for us in the end. This turned out not to be true, though. It turns out none of that is true. It’s not their faults, they had no idea what would happen to the world. It is someone’s fault though.

“Why?”


Because those upper-class wealthy individuals planned for this to happen. They wanted us to shoot for the stars and fall on our faces.

“Why?”


Because it directly benefits them. Our generation failing gives those wealthy class people the security that they’ve always wanted from the system. As long as the lower class is struggling to survive, they’ll do whatever they can, including fighting each other, to live.

“Why?”


Because when people are full of fear they often act irrationally. That’s why you need to be brave. You personally need to go out of your way to be good to everyone, be as kind as you can all the time. You need to help your neighbors, ask if there’s anything you can do, and, most importantly, ask for and accept help yourself. There is no one person who is a fortress. Nobody else is coming to save us, so we must all unite together to change the world.


At this point, the child stops. They look down at the ground for a long moment.


Then, they look at their mother and use the second most important word:

I go there once in a blue moon to be honest, but every time I would see this one barista there. We both would exchange a lot of eye contact with each other. A couple days ago, I went there and I ordered a coffee. She was stuttering upon her word so much that she had to face palm. I kind of took notice of that. Anyways, I would also see a reflection of her on the window im sitting near and I would see her staring at me. When I would walk to the washrooms, she would turn her head to see where I was going. I then felt that I had enough signals to go make my move. I mean, I did find her really cute. I had some small talk with her after ordering, and we smiled a lot. I took a piece of paper and I wrote “ honestly, I find you very attractive. I’d love to take you out sometime. <number>”. I did this because this was still during working hours and I wanted to give her the freedom of choice to contact me. She smiled when she took the paper. However, I didn’t get any reply ever since I gave her that paper. It is what it is I guess. My only worry is if I’ve misinterpreted signals. Any advice? ",1,1730956181.0,dating,11,0.67,False
1glj0lt,https://i.redd.it/6wghaslexezd1.jpeg,Tried out UCC The Blend,Tried it out since a lot of you guys recommend this as a very good instant coffee powder. At around 12 pesos per stick I think it’s a bit expensive for instant coffee but  it’s definitely better than Nescafé (and even Nescafe Gold) but it’s not a replacement for actual beans. If you want an okay cup of black coffee without going through the trouble of grinding and brewing then I guess it’s an acceptable alternative 😅…,5,1730956176.0,CoffeePH,1,1.0,False
1glizra,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1glizra/fellow_ode_aftermarket_auger_spring_improves/,Fellow ODE aftermarket auger spring improves grind uniformity?,"Hey coffee folks,  
  
I recently saw some sellers offering aftermarket auger springs for the Fellow ODE grinder. They claim that switching to thicker/stiffer springs improves grind uniformity. Since they were pretty cheap, I decided to give it a shot.  
  
Hardware-wise, the most noticeable change was that the rattling noise from the grind dial and auger key disappeared completely. As for taste, it might have improved (definitely didn't get worse), but it's hard to say for sure since I like trying different beans from various roasters.  
  
Here's the catch though: when I was realigning the burrs, I noticed one end of the spring wasn't sitting flat (it tilted when placed on a table). This meant I had to stack up a bunch of shims to get things parallel. Worried about potentially warping or damaging the burrs, I switched back to the stock spring. Interestingly, after switching back, I noticed the coffee flavors became slightly ""flatter"" or ""cleaner""—less pronounced flavor peaks. Now I'm considering trying the aftermarket spring again, but the thought of spending all that time realigning the burrs is making me hesitate.  
  
What do you all think—does the claim about thicker/stiffer springs = better uniformity make sense? I'm wondering, if it's such a simple and cheap upgrade, why wouldn't Fellow just do this from the factory? Would love to hear your thoughts!",3,1730956095.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are getting divorced, according to many, it's about time . I've always considered myself a patient woman, but I guess I was ignoring red flags. 
Ultimately, I wasn't ignoring them, more like waving as we passed each other.
Long story short, my husband who tried to contact both of his (long term) exes while I was pregnant with his first child. Who strangled me and shove me against a fridge, who got me drunk and convinced me to sleep with his bestie, who got me pregnant again, cheated again, moved me 1,200 miles away from my friends and family, who stabbed an air mattress inches from my face (while pregnant with his third kid) that I was sleeping on because I didn't make him coffee, who convinced me (an alcoholic) to sleep with multiple men for alcohol, I, who stayed home and raised 3 boys and home schooled them for eleven years. Who waited at home with a home cooked meal everyday, who never got to leave the house other than grocery shopping, who had to take care of 5+ pets I didn't even want, who has been solely responsible for everyone, eating, sleeping, learning etc , 
Could I in ANYWAY be the asshole.
Could I possibly be the Ahole for being upset that I wasted the last 11 years of my life with a man who physically, emotionally, and mentally abused me for YEARSwhile I even clipped his nails and took his boots off?? Please tell me I'm wrong for being mad that he wants to introduce his affair partner of 1 month to MY kids.

1gliuct,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gliuct/a_bunch_of_sentences_put_together/,A bunch of sentences put together ,"Hey hey,  
wassup?  
   
I don’t have much to tell you.  
I never really do, and I’m not *actually* talking to you anyway, but it never stopped me before.  
  
So ehhh for real 6 months since I sent that last text now, eh? A lot happened and nothing happened all the same since. That last sentence was terrible, but you got the gist. I didn't go out much: didn’t discover any new restaurants or anything. I tried to get back into old hobbies and start new ones, but nothing sticks and everything feels like a chore. I’m still affected by everyone’s crazy lives while looking at the clock of my own.  
Working, scrolling, barely sleeping.        
To be honest I’m just starting to accept that I miiiight've had depression for a few years now. I don’t think it really went away after my “burn out” (how fun, am I right?)...  Yes, that’d mean even when we met and I was all positive and shit. I won’t start a whole damn thing where I explain why I think that because it’d be heavy and completely useless, but I’ve been wondering if you somehow saw it.    
Were you dropping hints when you said that you were at my spot a few years prior meeting me or were you simply saying “I get your feels, but for me it was much worse”?  
^(Damn. That was a long question.)   
It would probably make more sense if you didn't know. Like… if you only saw my oh-so-obvious anxiety, but didn't hear the echoes of self-hatred coming from the pit in my stomach.  
If you heard them you would have cared, I think (?). You wouldn't have magically forgiven me and tried to save our friendship obviously, but I think you would have reached out after my last text. I mean… you’re the kind of person that cares a lot about others and their brains.    
In a way I’m kind of glad you didn't see how it could get under my helmet. I’m being honest here. If you ended up texting back just because of my shitty brain I’d feel insanely guilty. I already feel like shit when I’m just *thinking* of sharing bits about it to anyone, so that wouldn't help me at all. It would have the opposite effect, actually. Plus, you *really* have (hopefully *had*) your own shit to deal with.       
^(Talking about it here’s kinda ok, though. Noone to reassure.)    
   
Gosh.   
Here’s a random fact to lighten up the mood for a second:  
Next week we’ll have special snacks to celebrate a new coffee machine at my job. I kid you not they said “celebrate the new coffee machine” in a meeting… A HOT BEVERAGE POURER, DUDE. It felt surreal. I turned into Jim from The Office, looking for a (non-existent) camera. I wonder when I’ll get used to that kind of nonsense. Corporate jobs are still alien to me. I have to watch my language, too because “FUCK!” isn’t appropriate in a cubicle.    
Ok, break’s over before I lose track, sorry.   
   
I don't want you to worry *now*, though!  
^(Well… obviously.)   
Truth be told I probably don't *actually* have depression. Sorry for the false alarm. I’m most likely just looking for an excuse to do nothing in bed after work. Either that or I got the case of ""internet brain"" where I just ended up in too many sad subs and decided to turn them into my personality. That really might be what it is. My life is objectively a good one on paper, so I’m 99% sure I’m just being silly!   
    
So with(out) that in mind…  
BIG NEWS: I’m planning to get back on dating apps on the 23rd (‘coz, well, makes sense: if you know, you know (but you really might not know? (well either way it doesn't matter))). I’m aware that I mention it in a weird spot, but I swear I wouldn't go back to the dating world as a means of distraction and, before you question it: it wouldn't be a way for me to “fill a void” or whatever either.    
It’s more like you said at some point:   
“I won’t stop living my life and deprive myself of good relationships because of *that*”.   
^(I’m paraphrasing and maybe taking some liberties here, but it's close enough)    
I enjoyed doing nothing with you and maybe there are other people out there that would be glad to do fuck all with me as well.   
That’s it.   
   
Ahhh who am I kidding, here? I’ve been telling myself I’d “go back on dating apps soon” for the past few months. Aiin’t no way I’ll find the energy to do it now. I gotta take new pics for that too?  
Thanks, but no thanks.    
(I can already see the relief of imaginary strangers that thought “NO, FIGURE YOURSELF OUT FIRST OR YOU MIGHT HURT OTHEEERS!!!” and I think it’s kind of funny. I wonder if they gosh I’m so done with that topic.     
  
Ergh.  
I’ll end this letter very soon.   
At this point I’m pretty sure I’m just writing here because I can and that’s it. I’m not even sad we stopped talking anymore. I sorta miss it, but I also know that I barely met you in the end. So I guess at this point you became a reason to make me do something that’s slightly better than staring at my ceiling. A reason to write words and keep my brain somewhat active.    
   
Well.  
It’s out there, now.  
I’ll soon take care of the dishes.

It's just that sometimes she comes up to me to talk and there's times where she wouldn't even look at me the entire shift. I'm very confused :/. I so badly want to ask her for coffee but I guess the anxiety of rejection is really stopping me.

I (24M) have a crush on my coworker (25M). I’ve known her for 2 years now and my crush developed in the last year or so. She’s gorgeous, soft-spoken, intelligent, and very feminine. I started realizing I really liked her because I’d start getting nervous around her and because I’d think about her outside of work. Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, it's getting a bit more personal though. We both are tutors. 

Usually when I’m in public, I put on a mask that I’m very confident, but deep down I’m not. I’m currently going to therapy for this so I can change how I talk to myself. Anyways, at the end of my shift yesterday I was feeling very tired and drained, I didn’t feel like talking to anybody. All of a sudden at the end of the shift, she approached to talk to me. She's been coming up to me to talk recently and is very receptive to when I initiate too. So I'm just lost as to why she didn't even want to make eye contact with me today, she just immediately left work. Maybe she had something on her mind? Was she shy? Does she get nervous around me? She doesn't like me?

I feel like I get signs from her though. The other day she told me that I’d be such a good “girl dad” (I usually give off like big brother vibes to my students, I’m funny but also strict with them). Btw I’m not sure what exactly that means tbh. She's also been getting into deeper convos with me. Guess i just found today odd because she didn't even want to make eye contact with me, so i assumed she didn't want me to talk to her.",0,1730955564.0,dating,7,0.5,False

1glisu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1glisu8/the_social_hire_is_a_real_thing/,The 'social hire' is a real thing.,"I recently moved into a new team. First impressions were good. My boss is genuinely a really nice guy, always stands up for his team, etc.

Slowly I started realising that he actually does very little work and honestly doesn't really output anything of substance. What he does do, though, is be friendly to everyone. Constantly floating around the office talking to people, heading out for coffee with colleagues. Traveling to other states for events. He even won an award last year. At first I didn't think anything of it, until it hit me that this guy is getting paid substantially more than me to do less than half of what I do. Every major project we've done this year has been orchestrated by me. He's only able to report results to his boss because of the work our team created for ourselves. Despite being manager-level, he has little skills in strategy, task management and delegation, reporting, etc. He got to where he is from being social, talkative, and able to make a good impression.

I never used to really believe in the 'social hire' trope as I always thought that these people would be found out quickly. Now, though, I can see how they hide in plain sight and let others prop them up. I'm feeling a little disheartened as I've been busting my ass lately and have half the mind to just stop doing work for a while and see what happens.

I do genuinely enjoy my role and company though, and it's not like my hard work goes unrecognised. It's just a little frustrating.

1glipl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1glipl3/ro_down_memory_lane/,[RO] Down Memory Lane,"It was a cold and dark Wednesday when I heard the news. I could barely maintain my composure as the voice rattled on and on.

With a final goodbye, I hung up.

And broke down.

&#x200B;

The me before him would have scoffed at how we met. And at first glance, it sounded straight out of a movie, but sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction.

I met him before we even knew about each other.

He always chuckled when I brought up this story, but it seemed, to me, a serendipitous meeting.

We were visiting the Cologne Cathedral, my parents and I. They took a few pictures of me before the cathedral.

As the bells rang, a boy ran into the frame, chasing away the pigeons, and my parents took the picture right then.

That’s how we met.

&#x200B;

Of course, that’s not how we met at first. Our first proper meeting wouldn’t be until a good few years after, when I was a high school sophomore.

“Alright, class. Before we begin, we have a new student in the class. Oliver, please come up here and introduce yourself,” our English teacher at the time, Mrs. Rose, started one sunny Thursday.

He came up to the front, and did his whole introduction spiel. Even though he stood about a head higher than most of us, there was something… disarming about him. He seemed almost… awkward, and he chose, nay, agonized over each choice of word. I would have thought he had rehearsed this charade, were it not for his demeanor: a distinct feeling of a fish out of water.

After his introduction, Mrs. Rose sat him beside me. “She can help you with your missed weeks.”

He quietly nodded.

&#x200B;

At lunch, he asked if I could help him get started, and I agreed.

We set ourselves down at a picnic table, under the quickly-changing leaves of fall. Over our respective lunch, I would help him with catching up.

He proved to be a quick study.

“I’ve always been fascinated with his works,” he declared when we talked about Orwell.

“How so? Most of his works seem… dystopian at best,” I responded.

“Precisely!” he pointed at the book. “Most of what we read is black-and-white, where good triumphs and prevails, and bad gets punished. With him, everything is gray. As good as Winston was, he stepped out of line, so he was punished. As bad as Napoleon was, he became the one in power, and he prevailed.”

&#x200B;

It wasn’t long before we struck up a conversation proper, one that is untied to schoolwork.

Funnily enough, I was the one who started.

“So what do your parents do?” I asked him one day, after we were done debating about our newest author for the umpteenth time.

“It’s… hard to explain, really,” he replied, his brown eyes looking away from me and into the forest.

“I wouldn’t tell anyone,” I pleaded.

“You wouldn’t tell?” he asked, looking back at me incredulously.

In response, I do the zipping motion over my mouth. And then mime putting a padlock over it, just to be safe.

That was the first secret I kept of him.

&#x200B;

During one of our school’s multiple-day excursions, I asked him out under the shade of the grand oak. I would love to think it was a more romantic thing, but it was anything but. It was more a declaration than a question, a naive certainty that surely, surely he felt the same way.

“I… I’m gonna need a few days,” he said instead.

It wasn’t a rejection. But it sure felt like it.

&#x200B;

A few nights later, we were back in our normal surroundings, and I thought that moment had been forgotten.

A small rock tapped on my window.

I looked outside, and there he was, standing in our front lawn.

He motioned for me to open the window.

I did so, and he kneeled down on one knee, and gave his answer.

“Yes, I will be your boyfriend, Robin.”

&#x200B;

I was on cloud nine for a whole week after that. I cared not who could see me, I was just floating.

Days and months passed by as if in a dream. We went out more and more, and everyone at the school thought we would be the high school sweethearts.

At that time, I definitely thought so too.

&#x200B;

We had our own plans after high school: I wanted to go to MIT, nearly halfway across the country, and he wanted to attend a local college. We said we would keep in touch, and for a while, we did.

Alas, we both got wrapped up in our own sphere, and the messages slowed to a crawl. And then one day, it just… stopped.

When I finished my sophomore year, I went back home for the summer. But when I got back, his family had already moved out, and nobody, not even my parents, knew where they went.

&#x200B;

I blinked back tears on the bus, and stared at the roadside scenery whipping by. Even though we didn’t break up, it still hurt. I stared at that crack in my soul, and I wondered how I could move on.

Back at the university, I threw myself into work harder than I ever did. The intensity of which I worked seemed to frighten some of my peers. They kept telling me to take it easy, and go out sometimes, but all that fell on deaf ears.

I thought that it would help me forget about him, but at night, when I was not working, when I stared at the ceiling of my room in another sleepless night, all I could see was his face, his brown eyes looking at me tenderly, floating over me like a guardian angel. He would talk to me sometimes in my dreams, and my hopes would rise, but then the morning would come like a sharp bite of reality, and he would then be lost to the dreaming world.

&#x200B;

It was my senior year, I remembered, that someone asked me out. We chatted, and instantly I felt a connection. Not wanting to lose a relationship again, I did everything I could.

Which makes his words all the more cutting.

“I think… I think it would be better if we don’t see each other anymore.”

&#x200B;

After I graduated, I got a job as a web developer for a big start-up, and for a while, life seemed to be quite alright. I went back to my hometown several times over the years, probably most significantly to attend dad’s funeral.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that I sobbed like a baby. I could barely look at him in the coffin, and when he was lowered into the ground, the dam burst.

I stayed with mom for a while after the funeral. With life pulling the rug out from underneath us, we were… at a loss. At that time, it was like trying to go out on the water in a storm.

Our neighbors were the biggest help during that emotionally-fraught period, especially the father. He made sure we could get back on our own feet, and I’m eternally grateful for that.

I should visit him some time. Last I heard, he was in hospice, but it had been a while since I last visited.

&#x200B;

I returned to work after a few weeks of bereavement leave. Most of my colleagues, having heard what happened, shared their condolences. I smiled and nodded my thanks, but everything felt numb.

The first thing I heard when I got back was that management had hired a new guy for the team. From other members of the team, he was a hard-working individual, sometimes smart, but often needing a bit of hand holding at the start before he could work on it solo.

That Monday morning, as I pushed my way through the revolving doors, a tall man was talking to the receptionist.

“Hi Robin!” she waved at me.

“Hi Aver—”

The greeting died on my lips as he turned back to look at me.

The sharp brown eyes, the messy mop of hair, the blue-rimmed glasses.

There was no mistaking it.

&#x200B;

We sat down in a cafe shop in the building.

“Fancy seeing you here, Robin,” he started.

“Oliver, how…” I stammered. There was no way. It just couldn’t be.

“If you mean how I got a job here, it was recommended,” he answered. “A friend in university.”

“Is it one of our managers?” I asked, confused.

“Not sure, really. Think his name is James or something like that,” he wrinkled his eyebrows in concentration. “James, Jamie, something like that.”

“Jamie,” I suggested. He was lead of web development for the company.

“Something of the kind, yes.”

I took a sip of the white coffee while he sipped his fruit tea.

“Your family moved away,” I stated.

He nodded, “Mom was getting worse and worse. We argued, Dad and I, about whether she should be sent to hospice care. That conversation made me realize that as nice as our little town was, it was too far from any major hospital. And if anything happened to her, I’m not sure I can take it.”

He stared pensively into his tea. The peach slices bobbed up and down alongside the ice.

“So we moved out West, to an uncle of mine on my father’s side. We stayed there until Mom died.”

A tear rolled down his face.

“It was hard to watch as she got closer and closer to death’s door. Dad and I, we did everything we could to make her comfortable. And then one day, she’s just… gone.”

I nodded. Hesitantly, I pulled out a handkerchief and gave it to him.

“Thanks, Robin,” he said, before blowing his nose.

He hiccupped, “She never wanted… anything glamorous for… when she was gone, so we… had a small funeral, and then… cremated her. We still keep her ashes.”

I nodded understandingly, and moved my chair closer to him to pat on his shoulder.

He gave me a hug.

I was surprised at first, but I hugged him back.

“There, there. Let it all out now,” I whispered in his ear.

&#x200B;

In time, I told him about what I did between now and then. It was like we picked up right where we left off. He was still that boy I remembered all those years ago, just buried under the mundanity of modern life.

Our wedding, which our parent (his dad, my mom) attended, was a quiet affair. We then went on a two-week honeymoon, after which we went back to work with our respective pacings.

After our wedding, our respective parent moved in together. We were happy for them, and for a while, that was our household.

Autumns came and went, and our parents eventually reunited with their significant other in death. By then, we were successful enough that an early retirement was an option, and we did so.

The question of having children was brought up a few times, but I shot it down. As a compromise, we decided to adopt a child, Ash. She had been most wonderful, and I could not ask for anyone better.

&#x200B;

It started slowly with him. It was just small things at first: house keys, remote, and then it got bigger: a friend’s birthday, our anniversary, the combination to the safe.

I could do nothing but watch as he slowly faded away into nothingness. Ash, bless her soul, did everything she could to help him. It hardly staved off the descent, but I liked to think it helped, just a little bit.

One day, he fell down the stairs of our house. He was rushed to the hospital.

&#x200B;

Ash drove me to the hospital to see him in those final days.

He was laying down in his bed, wires and tubes and who-knows-what wrapped around him like a cocoon of medicine. A small smile escaped his lips.

“Hello, Ash,” he nodded at her.

“Hi dad. Brought mom with me today,” she beamed.

“Oh.”

He sat up a bit straighter, and turned to look at me.

“R-Robin, was it?”

I nodded tearfully.

He gestured for Ash to grab me a tissue.

“D-don’t cry, dear—” his whole frame shook with a cough. “I’m still here, aren’t I?” he smiled weakly.

I smiled back.

For a while, we just sat there in silence.

&#x200B;

The drive home was unbearable.

Despite the radio, I was still alone with my thoughts.

&#x200B;

As we were eating dinner, the landline rang.

A pit started to form in my chest.

“I’m gonna answer,” Ash stood up.

“Ash, you sit right there, young lady. I will answer.”

I walked over to the phone, and picked it up.

“Ms. Gray?” a voice asked hesitantly.

“Mrs. Gray, actually,” I answered.

&#x200B;

A few days later, I went in his study.

A letter was placed neatly on the desk.

I looked at it closer.

It was to me.

I opened the letter. There was no mistaking the loopy style of his handwriting. I sat down in his chair, and started reading.

*“Darling,*

*If you find this, I will have joined our parents in heaven.*

*Don’t cry for me, for the truth (and you know this) is that I never leave you.*

*As you are reading this, I imagine you must have a lot to say. A lot between us was left unsaid, only to be understood in a different light.*

*Let me tell you, first and foremost, that I love you. I know, it sounds all cheesy and whatnot, but it’s true. It was never in doubt in my mind that you are the most beautiful person, and it shall stay that way.*

*Like a beam of light, you came into my life, and warmed me from inside.*

*When I first met you, I was completely enamored with you. Who wouldn’t be? You’re kind, funny and generally just a great person to be with. Even as I write these lines, I still find myself blushing at the memory.*

*I was taken aback when you asked me out. Under the grand oak tree, I was, simply put, at a loss for words. I thought I would be the one to ask you out. Got a plan and everything. And then you did, and I was lost.*

*The talk with my parents afterwards was… interesting, to say the least.*

*Having only known you as a friend, I don’t want to ruin that thread we have between us.*

*You were… the best person I could have found, Robin. You are my anchor, my steady hand through the ups and downs of life.*

*Others can say whatever they want, but that’s what I believe.*

*Unless there was an irrevocable difference?*

*I’ve lived a full life, one with not many regrets. As I go to chase the next great adventure of death, let the record show that I don’t regret meeting you, Robin Gray. Give me another chance, and I’ll do it all with you.”*",1,1730955099.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1glinuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1glinuk/hookup_turning_into_something_more/,Hookup turning into something more?,"Long story long: About a month ago, I, F26, started hooking up again with a former flame, M29. We tried dating briefly at the beginning of 2020, but the pandemic and a bit of distance created tension. He became distant, I ended things, and eventually, he started dating someone else. A few months later, he called & apologized for how things ended, and we reconnected as friends due to our shared industry, where burning bridges isn’t ideal.

Fast-forward four years, and we coincidentally live in the same city. We kept bumping into each other at local coffee shops, chatting casually and decided to reconnect as friends. Over time, we began hanging out more frequently, but it was purely platonic.

We were catching up a couple of months ago, and he mentioned his dating experiences and how no one was catching his interest. Since we were talking about relationships, I told him I’d been in an open relationship, which was getting messy. He just listened, and nothing came of it. A month or two later, I was fresh out of that breakup, though he didn’t know it yet. He then asked me for drinks as a thank-you for a work favor I’d done for him.

We got those drinks in early October and had a fantastic night out — cocktails, arcade games, a rooftop bar, and much talking. He was noticeably flirty. I eventually confided in him about my recent breakup but asked him not to “make it weird.” He got even flirtier. We ended up back at his place, where he touched my legs a bit, but nothing happened. I fell asleep in his bed, and he took the couch.

The following week, I invited him over while I was house-sitting nearby. We stayed up until 2 a.m., watching my favorite movie. I told him he HAD to watch. The whole time, he was being flirty, touching my legs, and eventually acknowledging, “I think we’re both trying to figure out what we want here.” I told him I was down to hook up but made it clear that, fresh out of a breakup, I wasn’t looking for romance. I wanted to set that boundary so he wouldn’t feel pressured into anything more than fun and friendship.

We hooked up that night. He invited me to work with him at a coffee shop a few days later. He was casual, just talking like a friend. I asked if our hookup had made things weird and suggested that if it did, we didn’t have to do it again. He replied that he wanted to “do that a bunch more times.” So, a few days later, we met for drinks, talked, and kept things light. He asked what I was doing for Halloween, and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‘friend’ would be the love interest, Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn’t the ONLY thing we did. So we didn’t that night.

Since then, he’s been texting pretty regularly. It’s flirty and fun, and he’s sent me songs with lyrics that hint at “playing it cool when you like someone,” which felt a bit pointed.

Our most recent hangout felt almost like a date. We grabbed chips and margaritas, went antiquing, flirted, and even made out a bit in the store. He slapped my butt a few times, and when I asked about his dating life, he claimed he wasn’t on the apps at the moment and seeing anyone (which I took with a grain of salt). He did ask if I liked the songs he sent, and I casually said yes, dropping the topic afterward.

Later, we ended up back at his place, hooked up, and then cuddled a bit. He asked for my opinion on his apartment decor as I walked around the place in his shirt but soon left as he had to be up early for work. Afterward, he texted me, saying, “Sorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.” I joked that he “kicked me out,” adding that I wouldn’t have minded staying over. He replied nervously, “Well, the world’s our oyster! Who knows what the future holds 😅.” I told him to calm down; I was just flirting.

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him, saying: ‘idk if casual is for me. I'm not going to lie; I do have a crush. To keep things simple & stay friends, let’s take a step back and maybe pause on hanging out for a bit. Hope you understand.’

He responded: Hi, hi, sorry for taking so long to respond. I honestly think the friendship is a lot more important than the hooking up part, so if we need to take a step back and pause for a little while, I’m perfectly OK with that. I’d rather keep the friendship intact, and I appreciate you saying all this.

I jokingly responded, ""Pardon my French, but why did I say ‘I like you’ cryptically, and you politely said 'k'? lol...."" No response. I then go: ""My god, I'm not doing this. Thursday, make time for like an hour.""

He then says, ""I mean, I completely understand, but I didn’t mean to brush it off."" Obviously, I like you, too, but I do still feel that taking a little step back is important for the same reasons I mentioned. I can meet for a bit on Thursday, though!

I just say: ""I agree we're on the same page, which is why I mentioned it first. See ya Thursday. 

I feel like I come across as needy. I’m not looking for a declaration of his feelings, but I want to see if we agree. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me, too, but I’m not expecting that.

That was Friday. I still had a blast over the weekend, posting myself out with friends, having drinks, etc. But it's now Monday. It was constant, and now it's not. I know I had a part in making this confusing, but I'm scared to text or call now.

1glim53,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1glim53/advice_should_i_quit_keep_going_or_just_find/,"Advice; should I quit, keep going or just find somewhere else?","*this is ridiculously long TL;DR new job, first time barista, I make small mistakes (wrong pitcher, forgot garnish, forgot recipe in the moment), owners yell at me and tell me I should know better already, owners expect me to study outside work at all times, should I quit.


So, I was looking for a new job recently and thought being a barista could be really cool, I really like coffee and I like learning new things. I found a road block pretty quickly as most coffee shops in my area require at least 1+ year of barista experience. 

Eventually I heard back from somewhere I applied, it was a new small family owned coffee shop and seemed really nice! I thought it was everything I was looking for. They had me (with help) make a drink during my interview and ended up offering me a position. I was  happy because it seemed like a great opportunity considering I hadn’t had any previous experience. Then came all the red flags. 

Starting at this new place i was told I would technically not be working as a full barista until I pass the “test” (they only told me about it once but to my memory I have to make a few drinks with latte art in an allotted time) which is fair. Until then I will be making the small food items we offer and learning the drinks and how to do latte art. They told me starting pay is the minimum wage in my state and once I pass the test i will be a full barista and will be earning $4 over minimum wage. I’m not sure how barista pay typically is but I figured that seems pretty good! I later found out I dont get any tips until I pass the test either though which.. does not sound right. 

Now I want to preface this by saying although I’ve never worked in a cafe but I did work in fast food during highschool and now I work at a retail store doing sales where I am actually quite good at my job (I get “celebrated” pretty often and have always been a top seller). I also had another job for about half this year and  I haven’t had a hard time learning or memorizing things at any of these places. 

The problems started when I came in for my first day. As soon as I got there one of the owners immediately started quizzing me all about their menu and all these random questions about coffee (like what beans they use.. idk I just started here?? They expected me to “look around and find out” like bro I don’t know what I’m looking at, I barely knew what an espresso machine was at this point and I told you that during the interview lol!). Tbh I was really confused lol I figured *they* would be teaching me this stuff? Maybe I’m a bit dense but he literally told me I didn’t know enough and tried to make me like guess? All the answers even though I had literally never been given half the information. (Is this how this normally goes?) Anyways it was weird but eventually things started getting explained to me (but only ever once, they told me they don’t like repeating things and pretty much if they told me once and I forget I’m tuff outta luck) and I was told I needed to study the menu (fair, I just didn’t realize I needed the thing memorized because I’ve never worked anywhere like that before). They had me start making the menu food items and already it was a bit odd… the owners kept seeming to lose their tempers because I didn’t immediately get something, like they would show me once and then I would try and it wouldn’t look perfect on my **first** attempt and they would get all huffy, I thought it was weird but whatever, maybe I’m just really bad at all this stuff. 

My first two days I was only scheduled two hours but they suggested I “stay to learn” (except they didn’t really suggest and more so told me to because I was already behind in my knowledge) without pay. I did it because I felt dumb for not studying but now I’m a little worried because I lowkey worked for like 9 hours two days and only got payed for 2 (I stayed until closing both days). I started trying to memorize the menu after that but to be honest I really struggle with learning without anything in front of me, I would say at this point I know everything on the menu well but whenever I’m making the drinks sometimes I just get mixed up on which pitcher to use or which thing to pour first (like certain drinks you should pour a syrup first… some you should pour syrup second and I get mixed up on which drink is which sometimes and instead of reacting like normal people they get kind of ridiculously angry). This wouldn’t really be an issue (I would think) but today at work they told me several times that I “should know this already” because they had told me once or twice (sometimes they get mad at me for not knowing which pitcher to use on a drink I’ve never made?). They think I should have it perfectly memorized. I can’t tell if I’m just really slow/really bad at this job and should just quit while I’m ahead or if they’re being really unreasonable. 

Like to me it feels unreasonable, but idk? Is it that bad to get mixed up on this kind of thing? I understand it slows things down a little bit but I am really not used to doing anything like this and it’s definitely been a bit of a learning curve. (At my old fast food job we never really had to memorize stuff like this, we would have recipe cards and if you didn’t have that you had your coworkers, at this place they always tell me if I don’t know I should ask but then when I ask (even if I have the right answer and ask to make sure I don’t do it wrong) the owners get upset with me and kinda huff around and tell me I “should already know” and that they should be able to ask me this and I should be able to answer with confidence (I understand the point but I don’t think it’s wrong to check in to make sure I do it right before I do it wrong? Like the times when I have made drinks wrong they get incredibly angry at me for messing up and point out every little mistake I make and start talking over me at each other in a different language… it’s very uncomfortable). 

Anyways today was only my 8th day and I just feel so weirdly behind and fed up already. I’ve also never gotten a ten minute break or a lunch which is illegal in my state but I’ve been letting it slide because there are a lot of times where we get to sit down and go on our phones for a bit in between customers and we get free drinks (plus the owners don’t really take breaks either lol I feel bad). 

**(Update from the next day, today they got angry at me for asking where something was even though no one ever showed me?? Then they went on another rant asking why I was making “so many mistakes” (uhhh- I forgot to add a garnish to a drink (they reminded me) and I didn’t know how to serve something (no one showed me how) up until this point I’ve just been saying like ok and yeah you’re right whenever they point out my mistakes (even if something wasn’t explained to me (or was explained wrong in a couple cases)) but today I pointed out I had never served that stuff so I didn’t know and then they got mad at me for not asking and finding out earlier (even though they had JUST been telling me not to ask questions because I should just know intrinsically or some shit.)

I started applying to other barista jobs since I have some experience now but I’m not sure it’s really enough to get hired (not 1+ years) and idek if I wanna continue because although I find coffee interesting idk if I find it interesting enough if I will be treated like this everywhere. Also to note, I’m always working with one of the owners except they leave me alone 30 minutes to close (they also expected me to close alone on my third day? (first day even being scheduled to close) It was weird because I hadn’t even seen how to do most the stuff and also didn’t even have a key LOL), Also they clock me in and out and idk if they pay me if I stay longer than the 30 minutes to close (which I have most nights because idk how to do it fast yet). They also suggested I come early to “learn” (without pay) but I haven’t don’t that.

ALSO The owners expect me to spend all of my free time watching videos about coffee and latte art and if I come into work and say I didn’t have time to watch stuff they ask me what I was doing and act as if everything I’m doing doesn’t matter (and told me I was just giving excuses when I said I had a sick pet I am watching after rn). I watch some videos but them telling me it’s required makes me feel super stressed all the time, like I have no time to decompress and I have to spend all my time working (studying, watching videos, memorizing everything, hell they were even telling me to workout because I couldn’t lift something, lol). It’s literally almost 3am and I’m too busy stressing about work tomorrow to sleep… the stress is definitely affecting my ability to learn and memorize too which is very frustrating.

What do you guys suggest? Do I just have a bad apple? Is it like this everywhere in the business ? I wanna go with my updated resume to some places in person and let them know I have some experience and am committed to learning more but let me know if I should just give up now and choose a different field, lol. I don’t wanna be a quitter but I’m getting a little sick of the treatment, I was contemplating quitting by day four and now I’m just sick of it.

1glikq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1glikq2/sf_dont_fear_the_reaper/,[SF] Don't Fear the Reaper,"Oliver found himself in a white room.

A hooded figure sat at the lone table in the middle.

“Oliver, was it?” the figure rasped.

He turned around in surprise, “Yes, but who are you?”

The figure laughed, “Unimportant right now.” It gestured to the chair opposite. “Why won’t you take a seat, and we can talk a little bit, eh?”

He looked at the figure, eyebrows raised, but sat down all the same.

“That’s more like it,” the figure muttered.

Two cups materialized on the table.

“Tea or coffee?” asked the figure.

“Tea would do, thanks,” said Oliver.

The cups filled with a light yellow liquid.

“So, Oliver Graves, right? Just making sure I have the right person this time,” the figure started, flipping a clipboard.

“Yes,” he answered. *This feels distinctly like an interview,* he thought.

“Don’t worry, it’s not an interview as much as it is a chat,” said the figure.

*You can hear my thoughts?!* he thought.

“You don’t mind if I record this, right?” asked the figure, ignoring the question.

“N-no, not at all,” answered Oliver.

The figure put a voice recorder on the table, and started the recording.

“Today is the 7th day of Leaf Fall, of the year 2024. I am Marzanna, and sitting across from me is Oliver Graves. Oliver, can you affirm your presence?”

“Uh, yes. I am Oliver Graves.”

“Now, Mr. Graves, I have a stack of cards here. Please pick a card, any card.”

Marzanna spread the cards on the table. There were six cards in total.

Oliver picked the one on the far right.

“Alright, Mr. Graves, the first question: Do you regret anything in your life?”

Oliver pondered the question for a few minutes.

“A few, but too few to mention, I would say. Of course, being human, one has to have regrets. In fact, I have yet to see a human who doesn’t have regrets. At least in my life, of course.”

“Of course, of course,” Marzanna nodded. She gestured at the cards.

He pointed at the far left card.

“Do you fear death?” she read.

“As, like, a concept? No, I don’t think I do.”

“Can you elaborate on that, Oliver?”

He takes a sip of the tea.

“It’s very simple. The way I see it, death is but a small step on an adventure. You die, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you are out of the race. You’ve played your role, and now you get to enjoy a little bit of resting before going back into the fray.”

“I see. So death is just the start of a new journey?” Marzanna asked.

“Yes, yes it is,” he nodded.

She gestured at the cards.

This time, he picked the center card.

“Ooh, you’ll like this.”

Marzanna passed him a blue pen and a piece of paper. When he touched her skin, it was cold as ice.

“Without thinking too hard about it, write down as many words you associate with death. Two minutes sound good to you, Mr. Graves?”

He nodded, and started writing.

&#x200B;

“Darkness, light, sadness, grief, end, beginning, decay, and past,” Marzanna read out.

He nodded.

Using a red pen, she circled “darkness”, “sadness”, “grief”, “end”, “decay”, and “past” and showed it to Oliver.

“Do you think it weird that the language you speak have so many negative connotations when it comes to death, Mr. Graves?”

“Hardly,” he smiled. “I trust that in most languages, it will be the same, since nobody knows what happens after someone dies. And people fear what they don’t know.”

“That is true,” Marzanna muttered quietly.

A bell rang then. Marzanna paused the recording.

“You want to rest a bit, Mr. Graves? Talk to your family, have a drink, anything?”

“Yeah, talking to family seems nice.”

&#x200B;

He woke up in bed. The nurse was saying something.

“— fifteen minutes.”

Two people entered the room. A young girl, probably in her early 20s, and an old woman, probably as old as he was.

“Hi dad. Brought mom with me today,” the younger one beamed.

*Right, my family.*

“Hello Ash,” Oliver smiled.

The older one stepped forward. He racked his brains.

“And… uh… Robin, was it?”

She nodded and started crying. Oliver gestured for Ash to give her a tissue.

“There, there,” he tried to reach out, but the wires and tubes entangled me, forcing my arm back. “Don’t cry, dear. I’m still here, aren’t I?”

She tearfully nodded.

For a while, they just sat there in silence. Family had always been one of his pillars to lean on, and this time was no exception.

*Mr. Graves? We should go back soon.* I heard Marzanna.

*Give us a few more minutes, Marzanna.*

&#x200B;

“Thank you, Marzanna. I really needed that,” Oliver smiled at the hooded figure.

“No problem, Mr. Graves, no problem at all. Shall we?”

The cards were where he left them. He picked the middle card.

“Was death a frequent topic in your family?” she read out.

“Considering my parents’ work, it is something that has been brought up a lot. I attended a lot of funerals in my childhood, and my parents, they never really tiptoed around the subject.”

He took a sip of the warm tea, and continued.

“I remember we had a pet, an orange tabby I named Maya. She was a bit of a troublesome one, but we loved her all the same. One day, I discovered her laying next to the bowls, not moving, and I called out for my dad. He came and prodded her with a stick, then instructed me to find a cardboard box for her. We buried her that night in our backyard.”

She nodded, “It’s always hard when a loved one passes. Doesn’t matter if it’s a person or a pet, it’s always hard, and it never gets any easier.”

Oliver took a deep breath, and picked the left card.

“Do you believe in a higher power?”

He shook his head and sighed.

“Never find it of much use. Not to say that I denounce it, but I don’t find it of much use when death is staring me in the face.”

“Understood,” said Marzanna.

Without prompting, she picked up the last card.

“Are you ready to go on your next great adventure?”

He finished the tea.

&#x200B;

Marzanna sat down in her little office.

Peter poked his head in, “Hey, Marz, how did the chat go?”

“Definitely something to think about, Peter. He’s not afraid,” she smiled.

“That’s a relief. Usually they don’t really take it well”

“Usually, but not him,” she agreed. “A pity we are not currently in need of a Reaper, ‘cause he would do quite well, I imagine. A comforting presence, a philosophical mind, and a great yarn spinner. Hard to find that combination these days.”

She agreed with ""Okay, sure."" And on that Sunday morning I sent a ""Looking forward to coffee."" confirmation text in which she replied, ""Me too."" 

At the cafe, I will say, I could tell she was nervous meeting me because her hands were trembling when holding the menu. Of course I didn't call attention to it. We ended up really hitting it off—lots of laughing, flowing conversation, etc. Gave her a hug and went on our merry ways.

The next afternoon, I sent her a DM on IG stating it was a good time and we should do it again. It was short, sweet and to the point. No extra fluff. She agreed with a ""yes"" and a smiley emoji and gave me her availability for the following week. For whatever reason, she sent me her availability one hour after the ""yes"" and before I could even respond to the initial ""yes"". 

Again, I send a confirmation text the afternoon of the second date, and she replies with a simple ""Yeah."" We did Italian and drinks—and again, amazing conversation, playful banter, flirty vibes. Touch barrier broken a few times. We went on a walk after and had fun talking about random stuff and what-if scenarios. And after about 4 hours, we called it a night and exchanged phone numbers, and I told her to text me when she got home, so I know she got there safe. No, I didn't kiss her, but in retrospect, I think I probably could have. I'm not going to overthink that one. I played it safe. No biggie. I would kiss her on the third if the vibes are right again.

She did text me when she got home, as I asked her to and said, ""Home."" I then responded, ""Glad you made it home safely. I just got in."" And she responds, ""Good."" I didn't respond to that.

Just to give more context. I have initiated both dates and confirmed both times. Technically, the home text was a sort of ""directive"" of mine, for lack of better words, so it wasn't really an initiation on her end. Am I missing something or over analyzing? She seems to really like me in person but only responds in one- to two word texts (mostly no emojis) and doesn't initiate any conversations. We're at 2 weeks right now so I know it's early but I am getting mixed signals. I do not want to keep initiating and looking more interested than she is. It's been 24 hours since she last sent that ""good."". 

Any input or advice? Should I wait 2-3 days to see if she reaches out?

Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks—it’s a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration 🤨**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
If you use my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It’s a win-win for both of us. 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed 😅**  
There’s also a leaderboard, but I’ll be honest—it’s a bit intense. I haven’t made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I’ll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It’s a fun way to treat yourself with what you’ve earned!

If you’re looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I’ve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up.

Or if we both like a restaurant I suggest going there. Either they stop talking to me right there, or they say yeah that sounds great, let's figure out a time. Then they never respond to me again. Also If I suggest a date and time they make up an excuse why that isn't going to work normally a friend is having a party that day. Then they never speak to me again. They usually don't unmatch, either, but I will sometimes see them put new pictures on the profile.

I've just unearthed a treasure that'll make your taste buds dance and your wallet sing. The **Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug** is on a Black Friday bonanza, and I'm practically vibrating with excitement. [feast your eyes on this](https://savvyfridays.com/deal/ember-temperature-control-smart-mug/?mmiqc7) before this deal evaporates like the steam from your perfect brew!


I've been nursing my Ember mug for over a year now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. This isn't just any old vessel for your caffeine fix; it's a technological marvel that keeps your drink at the exact temperature you desire. Remember those days of lukewarm disappointment or tongue-scorching surprises? Gone. Vanished. Poof!


Picture this: It's a frosty morning, and you're cradling your Ember, filled to the brim with your favorite roast. The app-enabled magic ensures that from the first sip to the last drop, your coffee remains in a state of thermal bliss. I've savored countless moments where my chai latte stayed perfectly warm through long work calls or when my green tea maintained its soothing warmth during meditation sessions.


The mug's sleek design isn't just about looks (though it does make my desk look like a futuristic coffee shop). It's built to last, with a battery life that'll see you through marathon sipping sessions. And let's talk about that charging coaster – it's not just functional; it's a piece of art that beckons your mug home like a caffeine-powered homing beacon.


But here's the kicker – the [customization options](https://ember.com/products/personalized-ember-mug-2) are mind-boggling. Whether you're a precise Fahrenheit fanatic or a Celsius devotee, the Ember's got your back. You can even name your mug in the app. (Mine's called ""Liquid Lifeline,"" in case you were wondering.)


So, fellow java junkies, here's the deal: I'm snagging another one of these liquid temperature tamers because sharing is caring, and my partner's been eyeing mine with poorly concealed envy. With this Black Friday steal, it's the perfect time to join the ranks of the perfectly-temperatured beverage elite.


Don't let this opportunity slip through your fingers like sand in an hourglass (or grounds in a French press). Grab an Ember mug and elevate your drinking experience to heights you never knew existed. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you, and your mornings will never be the same!",1,1730953569.0,SavvyFridays,0,1.0,False
1gli96y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gli96y/girl_is_cold_in_text_very_warm_in_person/,"Girl Is Cold In Text, Very Warm In Person","Last Thursday | (34M) I asked a (34F) on an early-afternoon coffee date. She agreed with ""Okay, sure."" And on that Sunday morning I sent a ""Looking forward to coffee."" confirmation text in which she replied, ""Me too."" 

At the cafe, I will say, I could tell she was nervous meeting me because her hands were trembling when holding the menu. Of course I didn't call attention to it. We ended up really hitting it off—lots of laughing, flowing conversation, etc. Gave her a hug and went on our merry ways.

The next afternoon, I sent her a DM on IG stating it was a good time and we should do it again. It was short, sweet and to the point. No extra fluff. She agreed with a ""yes"" and a smiley emoji and gave me her availability for the following week. For whatever reason, she sent me her availability one hour after the ""yes"" and before I could even respond to the initial ""yes"". 

Again, I send a confirmation text the afternoon of the second date, and she replies with a simple ""Yeah."" We did Italian and drinks—and again, amazing conversation, playful banter, flirty vibes. Touch barrier broken a few times. We went on a walk after and had fun talking about random stuff and what-if scenarios. And after about 4 hours, we called it a night and exchanged phone numbers, and I told her to text me when she got home, so I know she got there safe. No, I didn't kiss her, but in retrospect, I think I probably could have. I'm not going to overthink that one. I played it safe. No biggie. I would kiss her on the third if the vibes are right again.

She did text me when she got home, as I asked her to and said, ""Home."" I then responded, ""Glad you made it home safely. I just got in."" And she responds, ""Good."" I didn't respond to that.

Just to give more context. I have initiated both dates and confirmed both times. Technically, the home text was a sort of ""directive"" of mine, for lack of better words, so it wasn't really an initiation on her end. Am I missing something or over analyzing? She seems to really like me in person but only responds in one- to two word texts (mostly no emojis) and doesn't initiate any conversations. We're at 2 weeks right now so I know it's early but I am getting mixed signals. I do not want to keep initiating and looking more interested than she is. It's been 24 hours since she last sent that ""good."". 

Any input or advice? Should I wait 2-3 days to see if she reaches out?

Edit: I have not yet set a third date.",1,1730953493.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1gli6h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gli6h6/weird_black_dots_on_teeth/,Weird black dots on teeth!,"Hello dentists of Reddit!
For a little over a year now, I’ve noticed some weird spots on a few of my front upper teeth, as well as in between the gaps in my upper front teeth. I took a photo of the back of these teeth and noticed these “stains” there as well. 

I’ve had maybe three cleanings since these dots started appearing, and they went away after each hygienist visit. I spoke to the dental hygienist the last time I went in, and she said that it may be calculus. I looked into this, but the Google images 100% do not match what I am experiencing. Additionally, it seems like calculus/tartar build up is a result of poor oral hygiene. 

I have (what I consider to be) decent oral hygiene. I brush twice a day and floss each night, and sometimes after meals. I generally drink a maximum of one cup of coffee a day, and the occasional cup of tea or glass of wine. Considering this, it feels highly unlikely that these dots are calculus, tartar, or even regular stains. 

Does anyone have any idea what they may be? More importantly, does anyone have any idea how to get rid of it???

(Note: I bought a water pic and it did not remove anything.) ",1,1730953220.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1gli5es,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_msvebiotic/comments/1gli5es/fashion_show_celebrating_literature_and_culture/,Fashion Show Celebrating Literature and Culture Concludes 10th Global Literary Festival at Marwah Studios,"Noida, India – October 2024: The grand finale of the 10th Global Literary Festival took place in style at Marwah Studios, as a unique fashion show celebrating literature and culture captivated the audience on the final day. The event was organized by the talented students of the AAFT School of Fashion and Design, who designed and executed a show that not only highlighted their creativity but also beautifully linked fashion with literary themes.



This one-of-a-kind fashion show featured seven diverse rounds of garments, showcasing the artistic abilities of AAFT students. The collections ranged from modern, experimental designs to traditional attire, each inspired by literature, history, and art. The final round, which drew special attention, focused on sarees from various states of India, emphasizing the cultural and sartorial diversity of the country. Each saree told a story, paying homage to the rich heritage of different Indian regions.



The event was inaugurated by H.E. Ali Achoui, the Ambassador of Algeria to India, and Dr. Pankaj K. P. Shreyaskar, Deputy Director General of PIMD at the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India. Their presence added a diplomatic and intellectual touch to the celebration, underscoring the festival’s mission of blending art with cultural diplomacy.



A special highlight of the event was the unveiling of a coffee table book titled Creativity in Depth: Art Illuminates Lives by Jyoti Saini Siddiqui. The book explores the powerful role of art in shaping society and transforming lives. It was warmly received by the audience, adding an intellectual dimension to the vibrant fashion show.



Dr. Sandeep Marwah, Founder of the Asian Academy of Film and Television (AAFT) and the Global Literary Festival, addressed the gathering with his signature message of unity. “We believe in bringing love, peace, and unity through art and culture,” he said, reinforcing the festival’s commitment to fostering international harmony through creative mediums.



H.E. Ali Achoui, Ambassador of Algeria, praised the efforts of the students and the festival’s unique combination of literature and fashion. He emphasized the importance of cultural exchange in promoting understanding and collaboration between nations. Dr. Pankaj K. P. Shreyaskar, representing the Government of India, also shared his thoughts on the role of art and culture in strengthening social and national bonds.



The evening’s guests were treated to festival mementos, including Sujata Singh, former Miss Delhi, and Mrs. India Queen from Mumbai, who graced the occasion with their presence and applauded the artistic efforts of the students.



The fashion show, along with the entire 10th Global Literary Festival, successfully showcased the transformative power of art and literature. It bridged gaps between tradition and modernity, celebrated cultural diversity, and encouraged the global community to unite through creativity.

Fresh bread, fresh fruit, vegetables, bags of flour, cans of coke, chops and steaks and chickens galore. How do we produce so much all at once in any season and in any part of the globe. Where the heck is it all coming from? 

Think about coffee alone - it takes a specific tree in a specific climate and a lot of work, yet it’s so easily accessible anywhere in the world day or night. Bags and bags and bags in every store and coffee shop and restaurant.
