I felt we were great for each other throughout this time, rarely having disagreements and always figuring our issues out together. Towards the end of college in late April we had our first major disagreement regarding plans after college and we reached an impasse. Nothing derogatory was said but we were did not talk for 2 days after this. I eventually called her and after a lengthy discussion she ended things with me on the phone. I was obviously distraught and blindsided by this but loved her enough to respect her decision. I did not reach out to her until a few weeks later when a mutual friend passed away, i was just relaying the news. After this we did not speak for around three months. At the end of July we had a wedding where I was the best man and she was the maid of honor. During the wedding we caught up a little bit but did not speak much. We exchanged glances but that was the extent of it. Afterwards I received a call and she wanted to get back together and try to make it work. I told her I needed time to think and pray on it. Two weeks following this we met up at a coffee shop and talked for around two hours. I told her I did not see this working out and we both left crying. This was two days ago and something in my head is telling me I made a mistake.

There are emotions involved that cannot be put into writing and years of history between us.

1mv4ksq,https://i.redd.it/2toq9z41m3kf1.jpeg,Collection (Review). Need suggestions.,"Going to be a long one. Starting with Designers.

How I got into this:
Back in school, a classmate used to wear ADG EDT, and I was completely blown away by the scent and the bubble around him. Ever since then, I wanted to own it and I finally pulled the trigger after landing my first job, picking up ADG Profondo.

**ADG Profondo**
If you love the OG ADG DNA but want something with more depth, Profondo is the way to go. It keeps the classic base while adding mineral notes (which are absolutely amazing). Longevity is on the lower side, but it's a total crowd-pleaser.
Rating: 10/10

**ADG Parfum (2024)**
I had high expectations with all the hype comparing this to the discontinued Profumo. But honestly, it feels a lot less like the OG than Profondo does. It leans herbal and gets a bit smoky in the drydown. Longevity is similar to Profondo, and it‚Äôs more versatile, but it‚Äôll never be my first choice. Profondo stays my go-to for summer and office wear.
Rating: 8/10

Now coming to ME:

**AAM Aqua Oud**
Got this before the ADG Parfum to get a feel of Profumo's DNA. Surprisingly, the opening feels more aquatic than ADG Parfum, and the drydown is almost identical. Longevity is solid, probably even better than the original.
Rating: 7.5/10

**AAM Ignite Oud**
Boy oh boy! This is hands-down my favorite of the lot. Imagine someone who stands out in any situation, walks in with confidence, and has signature traits, this is their scent. Just 2 sprays a day and you‚Äôre golden.
Rating: 11/10

**Blue by Ahmed**
A basic freshie with a nice drydown. The opening? Smells exactly like Limca.
Rating: 7/10

**Afnan SNOI**
Probably the first bottle I ever finished. My go-to office scent for a while and it pulled in compliments. Smells like burnt pineapple (in a good way) all day. Longevity is crazy, I could smell it on my shirt the next day. Projection was strong, though I often went noseblind.
Rating: 8.5/10

**Ramz Silver**
One of my early buys. Picked it up after all the clubbing scent hype, especially as a better value than 9pm, and I kinda agree. At first, I hated it and shelved it for a year. Then one random spray day, my whole room smelled like pink Boomer bubble gum,and it was way better than I remembered.
Rating: 8/10

**Sheikh Zayed Blue**
Was considering a blind buy of Dior Sauvage EDT, so I tested this instead, and honestly, glad I did. It's a good freshie, very office-friendly, but nothing special. Not worth dropping designer money on, in my opinion.
Rating: 7.5/10

**Theoreme**
I‚Äôve tried Bvlgari Tygar, and this is a very good clone. Personally, I don‚Äôt love the opening‚Äîfeels off every time, but the drydown is amazing. A scent that grew on me over time.
Rating: 7.5/10

**Frank Olivier Blue Touch**
Already had Profondo and Parfum, but still missed the OG EDT, so I grabbed this as a cheap alternative. But to be real, it‚Äôs not even close. A decent aquatic scent that kinda reminds you of the OG, but definitely not a clone.
Rating: 7/10

**Rasasi Fattan**
This is a lifetime rebuy. Super fresh, and I love the vetiver. Wore it to the gym once and some guy (who I'd never even spoken to) asked if I was wearing Terre d‚ÄôHerm√®s. So yeah, it must be close.
Rating: 9.5/10

**Armaf Odyssey Homme**
Blind buy from a Myntra sale. Honestly surprised by the quality. I usually avoid sweet scents, but this balances it well with spice and vanilla. You‚Äôll smell like a walking kulfi.
Rating: 7.5/10

**Rasasi Hawas**
Total blind buy regret. Smells super synthetic. No clue why this is hyped. Had Zara Seoul, which smells exactly the same(girls used to love it for some reason). Longevity on my bottle is poor, so I‚Äôm letting it maturate.
Rating: N/A (for now)

**Khamrah Qahwa**
My most recent pickup. Had very high hopes for the coffee note, plus the internet hype. But man, the disappointment. Tried so hard to like it,kept sniffing my hand for an hour,but all I got was synthetic coconut. Smells like Bounty chocolate, not coffee. If anyone had a similar experience and maturation helped, do let me know.

Lemme know what you guys think, will this work for a story, is it entertaining, ect ect. (This is also the second revision so punctuation and spelling errors have been cleaned up.)

Prologue re-write:
‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs power is determined at birth. At least, that part‚Äôs true. What you do with it afterward‚Äîthat‚Äôs what really makes the difference.‚Äù
In this world, there are three kinds of people.
First, the Seers. They‚Äôve got the unnerving ability to look beyond the normal human realm. Some can predict battle tactics before a fight even starts, others can chat with the recently deceased. Creepy, right?
Then you‚Äôve got the Tenjinaji‚Äîimaginative warriors who conjure weapons straight out of their minds. Impressive, sure, but they‚Äôre usually a little reckless‚Ä¶ and a little too eager for blood.
And finally, the Blessed Children. We just call them BCs. They‚Äôre the lucky ones‚Äîthe kids who always seem one step ahead in everything. They even get the rare privilege of knowing what their power will be before their twentieth birthday.
Me? I‚Äôm Oscar. And if my math‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm about six years overdue on finding out what I am. The doctors say it‚Äôs rare, but not impossible, for someone to never receive a gift. Those of us left behind get called the Forgotten. Sounds worse than it is. We‚Äôre only about three percent of the population, and honestly? I‚Äôve made my peace with it.
I don‚Äôt need to see ghosts or swing around a massive battle-axe. I‚Äôve got my nine-to-five job, a quiet apartment, and a very boring life. Still‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt mind if something interesting happened once in a while.
Take last week, for example. I was watching the news when a Ravencrest Titan appeared out of nowhere and leveled an entire village not too far from here. A squad of Tenjinaji had to be sent in, but half of them were ripped to shreds before they finally brought the thing down.
Yeah. That would suck.
So maybe my life isn‚Äôt so bad after all.

Chapter 1: Chance Encounter (re-write) 

The clouds overhead swirled like a dense canopy, split apart every few seconds by jagged veins of lightning.
Oskar, a very unassuming man, tugged his curly brown hair into a bun before stepping into the local tavern. The smell of his aftershave was quickly drowned out by the heavier scents of booze, sweat, and smoke hanging in the air.
At just under 5‚Äô10, Oskar wasn‚Äôt exactly imposing, but most of the regulars knew him and treated him kindly enough.
‚ÄúYo, Oskar! Over here!‚Äù
The booming voice belonged to Shamal, who‚Äîunsurprisingly‚Äîwas impossible to miss. Standing over nine feet tall, he had to duck through nearly every doorway. Where Oskar would call movers, Shamal just strapped furniture to his back and hauled it himself. Where Oskar could barely jog for five minutes, Shamal could run for days without breaking a sweat. Physically, they were opposites in every sense.
‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Oskar said with a smirk as he approached, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really need to yell. You‚Äôre kind of hard to miss.‚Äù
Shamal‚Äôs ocean-blue eyes sparkled against his coffee-dark skin as he waved Oskar over. ‚ÄúGrab a seat, man! I ordered us a round.‚Äù
Grab a seat, Oskar thought. More like five. Still, he obliged and pulled up a chair across from his friend.
‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Oskar asked after a sip of his drink, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new in Tenjinaji land? I heard you guys had some rough losses in that last battle. You holding up okay?‚Äù
Shamal‚Äôs hands‚Äîbig enough to make a pint glass look like a shot‚Äîpoured ten at once into his custom-made mug. He downed it in one gulp, then let out a sigh.
‚ÄúOh man, you mean the Ravencrest? That thing tore through us from head to toe. Ugly bastard. We were getting shredded out there until one of those BCs showed up. She took one look at it, it took one look at her and then‚ÄîBOOM!‚Äù
He slammed his mug on the table hard enough to rattle the chairs. ‚ÄúThat sucker exploded into a million pieces. Don‚Äôt even know how she did it, but thank the gods she did. Otherwise I‚Äôd be toast.‚Äù
Oskar raised a brow. ‚ÄúYou? The Giant of Hemel? Toast? Don‚Äôt you conjure weapons other Tenjinaji can‚Äôt even lift? And then this ‚ÄòBlessed Child‚Äô just shows up and‚Äîpoof‚Äîthe monster‚Äôs gone? Doesn‚Äôt that sound a little fishy to you?‚Äù
Shamal scratched his bald head for a moment before shrugging. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how it goes sometimes, I guess. Anyway, man, I‚Äôm still alive. So how about another round and we get down tonight?‚Äù
‚ÄúSure thing, bud.‚Äù

Hours passed. Most of the patrons had gone home, but Shamal was now in the middle of the tavern, arm-wrestling anyone who dared challenge him. Seers tried to play mind games, Tenjinaji tried brute force‚Äînone of it worked. One by one, they were tossed aside like ragdolls.
Oskar checked his watch. Nearly 3 a.m. He drained the last of his drink and tapped Shamal on the shoulder.
‚ÄúHey, man. I‚Äôve gotta head out. Work tomorrow.‚Äù
Without missing a beat, Shamal slammed another opponent‚Äôs hand into the table. ‚ÄúNo problem, brother. Still down to go out this weekend? You know I need my wingman.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, sure thing.‚Äù
Shamal pulled Oskar into a hug so strong it made him wheeze. ‚ÄúHey‚Äîbuddy‚Äîcan‚Äôt breathe,‚Äù Oskar gasped.
‚ÄúAh, sorry about that,‚Äù Shamal chuckled, loosening his grip. ‚ÄúAlright, see you later.‚Äù He turned back to the few patrons still brave‚Äîor drunk‚Äîenough to try their luck. ‚ÄúAlright, who‚Äôs next?‚Äù
Oskar shook his head, chuckling as he pushed through the tavern doors into the night.

      The streets were quiet, too quiet for this hour. Usually there were still drunks staggering home or carriages clattering past, but tonight the silence pressed down heavier than the storm clouds. Only the rumble of thunder and the occasional hiss of wind filled the air.
He adjusted his coat and started walking. Out of the corner of his eye, a shadow stretched unnaturally long across the wall, sharp and crooked. His stomach clenched. He turned fast‚Äî
Nothing. Just the flicker of a lantern.
‚ÄúGet a grip,‚Äù he muttered, quickening his pace.
Then came the sound. A faint scrape, like claws dragging across stone, keeping time with his footsteps. Oskar froze, straining to listen. When he stopped walking, the sound stopped too.
He swallowed hard, sweat prickling at the back of his neck. Against his better judgment, he spun around to confront whatever was there‚Äî
‚Äîand slammed shoulder-first into someone rounding the corner.
The impact knocked him backward onto the cobblestones. The woman standing over him wasn‚Äôt just striking‚Äîshe was impossible. Taller than him by a head, every line of her frame looked carved, not grown. Her hair caught the lantern light like strands of molten gold, and her skin seemed untouched by fatigue, blemish, or scar. Even her posture, casual as it was, radiated a kind of unspoken superiority.
But it was her eyes that froze him in place. They glowed faintly, a slow-burning light under the surface, as if they could ignite at any moment.
A Blessed Child.
Oskar‚Äôs chest tightened. He didn‚Äôt need her to introduce herself‚Äîthere was no mistaking what she was.
And if one of them was here, wandering the same empty street as him in the middle of the night‚Ä¶
Then whatever had been following him wasn‚Äôt just his imagination.",1,1755662467.0,CritiqueforWriters,0,1.0,False

1mv4in9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mv4in9/the_prophetic_pages/,The Prophetic Pages,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I‚Äôd be home late. I didn‚Äôt realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I‚Äôve already told you that I don‚Äôt like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I‚Äôm so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's‚Äîshe's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew‚Äîfriends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2023""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt hear them arguing, but I didn‚Äôt have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn‚Äôt pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn‚Äôt believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn‚Äôt survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn‚Äôt save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what‚Äôs going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she‚Äôs dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it‚Äôs okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I‚Äôm so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn‚Äôt answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can‚Äôt sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That‚Äôs when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?""¬†

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?""¬†

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven‚Äôt answered my question: what is this book?!""¬†

""That‚Äôs the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn‚Äôt a choice; it‚Äôs a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn‚Äôt. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It‚Äôs not the cause but a reflection of the choices you‚Äôve made and the connections you‚Äôve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it?¬†

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose?¬†

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it?"" I inquired.

The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man.

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers‚Äîlikely from that dreadful book‚Äîechoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.

We met a long time ago as kids (maybe 6 and 7?) through local theater productions, but we were never good friends, and we even had a few disputes. We later reconnected through a different theater company when I was in middle school. We got close and were best friends at the time, until we slowly just drifted apart because we saw eachother less in theater. She auditioned for my school during my sophomore year, which was spent in quarantine, and started in person at the beginning of my junior year. We are one year apart in age and two grades apart, so my junior year was her freshman year.

We had one playwriting class together that year, and we were able to reconnect pretty quickly. During my senior year, she was one of my best friends and was constantly with me since we had many classes and performance groups in common. She helped me with my college decisions, family struggles, my senior projects, and talked with me on the phone for hours nearly every day. There were some issues between her and my friend group, mainly due to the 2 grade gap between us. I didn't always prioritize our relationship over the others, which I regret because I was talking non-stop about how I didn't feel like they were healthy for me. After my senior year, I chose to spend more time with her, which involved us hanging out all summer and growing even closer. I realized I had romantic feelings towards her and felt almost uneasy hanging out because I just wanted to tell her how I felt. We both knew we were queer, so I knew it was possible for her to feel the same way, but it always seemed so unlikely. I

entered college at our city's university, so I was still close, but we weren't able to hang out nearly as much as we used to. We didn't talk on the phone as much and barely met in person, but we were able to make a plan to get lunch at an event we would both be at near the end of my freshman year. She ended up bailing because of a senior class event, and I understood, but we never made plans to meet up again. I had crushes before her, but what I've felt for her is so much more than that, and thinking about it makes me feel like I can't breathe. We always talked about how we were the same person, the only one who truly understood the other, and how we were soulmates. She's the kindest, most talented person I know and truly the most gorgeous person on Earth. Her personality is incredibly magnetic, and she's always been able to become the most popular person in any room with how charming she is. Getting over not being around her often and growing apart felt like a grieving process, and I still think about her every day.

She messaged me a few days ago, and we made a plan to meet up in a week before she leaves for college across the country. This will be the first time I've seen her in a year and a half, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. I know she's leaving for school, but I feel like I need to tell her how I've felt for the past 3 years. I think about her all of the time, and I don't know what to say or if I should say anything at all. Please give me some advice!",1,1755662287.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I‚Äôd be home late. I didn‚Äôt realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I‚Äôve already told you that I don‚Äôt like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I‚Äôm so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's‚Äîshe's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn‚Äôt survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn‚Äôt save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what‚Äôs going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she‚Äôs dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it‚Äôs okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I‚Äôm so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn‚Äôt answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can‚Äôt sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That‚Äôs when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?""¬†

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?""¬†

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven‚Äôt answered my question: what is this book?!""¬†

""That‚Äôs the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn‚Äôt a choice; it‚Äôs a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn‚Äôt. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It‚Äôs not the cause but a reflection of the choices you‚Äôve made and the connections you‚Äôve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it?¬†

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose?¬†

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it?"" I inquired.

The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man.

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers‚Äîlikely from that dreadful book‚Äîechoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1755662250.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

The steam from the coffee on the table had vanished at some point. The timer on my phone, which I‚Äôd set for 60 minutes, was ticking down second by second, with only a sliver of time remaining. A gentle early summer breeze blew in through the slightly open window, making the blinds sway. With each movement, the setting sun flickered across the past exam questions spread out on the table. The flickering light looked for all the world like a warning signal.   
  
The fact that a thought like that even crossed my mind was probably a sign that my exam studies were in seriously bad shape. Spring was long over, and the days were gradually getting warmer. And yet, I still hadn't decided on a prep school and was just bouncing from one trial lesson to another. I was well aware that I was getting a late start. Even on the way home from a trial lesson I‚Äôd attended with Yukinoshita, the conversation had turned to, ""At this rate, we might be in trouble, huh‚Ä¶?"" So, we decided to study a little and spread out our reference books and practice exams at a cafe. For a time, we both studied without much conversation.   


I figured I should start by gauging my current abilities, so I began working through a past exam, tackling Japanese History and then Japanese Language in order. About two hours had passed. Most of the questions were multiple-choice. Thanks to that, I was able to answer them quickly without getting too hung up on anything. With these kinds of questions, the correct answer is always right there among the choices. If that's the case, all I had to do was eliminate the obvious mistakes, red herrings, and misdirections, and the answer would naturally reveal itself. Even if I didn't know it at first glance, I could at least narrow it down to two options, thinking something like, ""The kaigoshu and the toshiyori‚Ä¶ which one was which again‚Ä¶?"" 

Once I got it down to that, it was all up to fate. I rolled my pencil, jotted down the answer, and even had the presence of mind to add a little note next to the question: ""Getting these mixed up."" But then, a written-response question suddenly appeared and stopped me in my tracks. In blank space 3 of passage B, insert the impression the author had regarding the event in the underlined section. Formulate the most appropriate expression in your own words, and write it in the designated space on the answer sheet using 20 to 25 characters. 

My pen, which had been moving along smoothly, came to a dead stop. It wasn't that I didn't know the answer. I'm actually pretty decent with humanities subjects. I could even guess what kind of answer they were looking for. But the ""in your own words"" part was what troubled me. Give me a break. You can't just spring ""in your own words"" on me in the middle of a paper test... Are you really going to try to measure my individuality in twenty-odd characters? What is this, one of those slightly pretentious questions from a department with some fancy name...? I have no idea what they even study at universities these days with theseÂ≠¶ÈÉ®names that have multiplied in recent years... 

After grumbling internally for a while, I started thinking about how to phrase my answer. As I did, I stretched my arms wide to loosen my stiff shoulders. When I lifted my head, my eyes met the seat diagonally across from me, where Yukinoshita was studying just as I was.

Yukinoshita sat with perfect posture, tackling her own practice exam with a cool and composed air. It was a practice exam for a fairly difficult university, but the mechanical pencil in her hand moved smoothly and without hesitation. 

However, she must have gotten stuck somewhere, because her hand stopped, and she furrowed her brow with a little ""hmm."" Then, she tilted her head thoughtfully and tapped the pen against her soft cheek. Before long, she must have found the answer. ""Ah,"" she whispered, a smile breaking on her lips as her pencil began to move once more. For someone as competitive as Yukinoshita, perhaps even studying for exams wasn't a chore. She looked so endearing, as if she were savoring the small joy of solving a problem. 

Come to think of it, she likes quizzes and stuff, doesn't she...? There have been a few times when I meant to ask a trivia question to someone else, only for Yukinoshita to buzz in, answer correctly, and then pump her fist with a tiny ""yes!"" after getting 80,000 points... If I were to watch a quiz show with her, she'd probably blurt out the answers before anyone on screen could. And every time she got one right, she'd turn to me with a smug ""how-about-that"" look on her face, I'm sure of it. 

No, wait... What's with that thought...? That's actually kind of... nice... As I was staring at her with my chin in my hand, Yukinoshita seemed to notice my gaze. She brushed back a stray strand of hair with her fingertips, tucked it neatly behind her ear, and tilted her head. 

What is it? 

She asked without a sound, just with her eyes. 

Nothing. It's nothing. 

I replied without speaking, just with a little shake of my head, and dropped my gaze back to my exam booklet. Just then, I saw a small smile tug at the corners of her mouth. Well, staring at Yukinoshita wasn't going to help my studies. For now, I should just finish the practice exam in front of me. I returned to the written-response question that had stumped me earlier and began scribbling a rough draft in the margin of my notebook. Right. The gist of the argument is more or less there... Now, how should I put it all together? I tapped my pen against the notebook, ""tap, tap,"" and twisted my neck as I pondered. 

Just then, something was slipped into the corner of my notebook from the seat across from me. Wondering what it was, I looked down to see a piece of loose-leaf paper, folded neatly two or three times. The way the top-left and bottom-right corners were folded in to create a letter-like shape was very similar to the notes girls pass during class. Actually, it was exactly like that. 

I glanced at the sender sitting across from me, but Yukinoshita was pretending not to notice, scribbling away intently. ...Well, I guess this is just a normal note, then. With that thought, I unfolded the paper. Written there in Yukinoshita's characteristically beautiful handwriting was a single phrase. 

You done?

After reading it, I looked back at Yukinoshita. She was unchanged, not even sparing me a glance as she kept her eyes on her reference book and wrote in her notebook. But every so often, she'd let out a tiny sigh and toy with the hair that fell over her shoulder. Seeing that, I could tell she was curious about my reaction. When she acts like that, it feels wrong to just ignore her. Besides, my studying isn't getting anywhere. I decided to quickly jot down a reply. 

Not yet. You? 

I scribbled it back in my own terrible handwriting, folded the paper back to its original shape, and gently pushed it across the table. Alright, replied. Back to studying... I thought, but my focus lasted only a moment. Once again, a piece of loose-leaf paper slid into my peripheral vision. Right, well, that makes sense. I was the one who replied with a question... Of course she'd reply back. 

I picked up the folded loose-leaf and quickly opened it. 

Finished grading, too. 94 points. 

The handwriting was as neat as before, the message concise and calm. But I could see a hint of elation in the slightly upward slant of the characters, and I couldn't help but let out a small laugh. I glanced across the table to see Yukinoshita casually brush back her hair and give me a proud, triumphant look. Man, that smug face... Still, getting over 90% on a practice exam at this time of year is genuinely impressive. 

Not bad. I'm almost done, so just wait a bit. 

I wrote back a simple message of praise. It would be rude to make her wait too long. I decided to wrap things up quickly and began to write the answer to the descriptive question. And just then, another loose-leaf note slid smoothly across the table. 

5 minutes left.

I glanced at the timer on my phone. The remaining time was, indeed, exactly 5 minutes. Crap, I gotta write fast... For now, I put off replying, carefully pushed the note back, and furiously scribbled the answer in my notebook. Then, another loose-leaf note was pushed my way. 

4 minutes left. 

Can you stop the countdown? What are you, a broadcast writer? 

We're not in a radio booth, you know. You could just say that out loud... I thought, scribbling my reply on the paper and pushing it back. At that, Yukinoshita let out a small giggle. She then prepared to write another reply, smoothing out the creases of the paper with her left hand. But I couldn't afford any more of this note-passing. I'm trying to study for my exams here. Okay, stop, stop. This ends now, I decided, and reached out to firmly press down on Yukinoshita's left hand. 

""Ah...""

Yukinoshita let out a bewildered little gasp. Then she pouted her lips, her gaze turning slightly sulky and accusatory. No, nope. Making cute faces like that won't work on me. Some things are just not okay. I deliberately looked down, trying to project an aura of being busy. For now, I had to focus on the question in front of me. Focus... I told myself, but it was impossible. I just couldn't concentrate. The softness, the smoothness, the warmth was all just... so distracting... The answer I was trying to write, the vocabulary that should have been at my fingertips, was melting away as soon as it formed. I somehow managed to force myself to write it down. Then, just before my phone's timer went off, like a chess player hitting the clock, I slammed my pen down with a loud thwack!

Feeling like I‚Äôd just finished a major task, I let out a deep breath. As if on cue, Yukinoshita tilted her head.

""Are you finished?""

""Yeah. Well, I still need to grade it...""

""I see. I'll wait, then.""

""Ah. Thanks, sorry about that.""

I didn't want to keep her waiting. Might as well get the grading over with quickly. I went to lift the hand that was still covering Yukinoshita's. But as I did, I felt a faint resistance. Looking down in confusion, I saw Yukinoshita's pinky finger was lightly hooked around mine, like a cat hooking its claws.

""Um...""

Could you... maybe let go? I can't really open my test booklet in this state, you see. I mean, it's not that I dislike it or anything. In fact, I'd say I quite like it, but... it's just a little, you know? I tried to convey all of that with a single ""Um..."" and a pointed look. But Yukinoshita abruptly turned her face away. Then, using only her right hand, she started flipping through a reference book, page after page, as if to say, ""See? You can do it with one hand."" Oh wow, Yukino, you're so dexterous\~! I thought, watching her with a mix of admiration, but then she shot a glare at me.

""Hurry up."" 

""Ah, yes...""

Following Yukinoshita's lead, I opened my practice exam booklet with just my right hand. With only one hand free, we continued to flip through the pages, a silent, mutual inconvenience. I marked my makeshift answer sheet with circles and crosses, writing in the correct answers next to my mistakes. My handwriting was a mess from doing it one-handed, but it was still legible enough. After clumsily finishing the grading, I closed my notebook with a soft thud. 

""Well, that's about what I expected...""

I got about 80% correct, which I guess I'll have to hope improves in the future. I looked up to say, ""Sorry to keep you waiting,"" but my gaze found that Yukinoshita had already closed her reference book at some point. It seemed she had been watching me struggle, her chin resting in her hand. When our eyes met, she gave me a soft smile.

""Good work. Shall we take a little break?"" 

""Yeah. I'll go grab some coffee...""

As I stood up, Yukinoshita followed, and we headed to the counter. We ordered a coffee and a tea respectively, and headed back to our seats. ...Except, we were supposed to be heading back. Why is our seating arrangement different now? I wondered, glancing sideways to see Yukinoshita sitting down next to me, sipping her tea as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

So nonchalant. Why is she sitting next to me...? Not that I mind. In fact, it's more than fine. Perhaps sensing my baffled stare, Yukinoshita gave a small cough. 

""I brought the prep school pamphlets. I got them, just in case..."" 

Muttering in an incredibly soft voice, Yukinoshita started spreading out the pamphlets from the trial lesson. 

""Oh, right...""

I see. That makes sense. If you're going to look at a pamphlet together, you sit next to each other... Wait, really? Is that necessary...? ...Yeah, it is. It has to be. In fact, it's the only natural way. I'm convinced! While I was busy nodding to myself, Yukinoshita was already flipping through the pamphlet. 

""Have you decided on a prep school? We've looked at a few now...""

""Ah, well, it's definitely not this one. The self-study room doesn't have enough seats. It's fine now, but it's going to get crazy crowded later. The whole college entrance exam process is already a game of musical chairs; I don't want to play it before it even starts.""

 Yukinoshita chuckled and nodded in agreement at my exasperated tone. 

""I know what you mean."" 

""Right? And it's hard to concentrate when there are too many people. It's like a sauna. I'm trying to quietly enjoy the heat, and then a bunch of college kids roll in like a Dragon Quest party, all chirping and making a racket. It completely ruins the vibe."" 

As I went on and on, Yukinoshita let out a sigh that was a mixture of exasperation and amusement. 

""Hikigaya-kun, your metaphors are always about saunas, anime, or ramen. Is your head a l√∂yly?""

""Could you not hit so close to home? You're the one throwing cold water on things, which makes you more of a l√∂yly... Anyway, sorry. I'm always going on about saunas."" 

""I'm used to it by now. Besides, you look like you're having fun when you're talking about pointless things."" 

Saying so, Yukinoshita narrowed her eyes, a faint smile on her face. Her gentle gaze seemed strangely mature, like that of a beautiful older woman. Being looked at like that made me feel incredibly self-conscious. It's a little embarrassing, so I wish she'd stop... Alright! Time to spout some nonsense and change the subject!

""Hey, it's not pointless. Saunas are amazing. Your metabolism improves, so even the food tastes better. It's a huge QOL boost. They even have this thing called 'sameshi'‚Äîsauna food‚Äîthat's getting popular. Have you heard of the curry at Hokuou? They even had a collaboration bento at the convenience store.""

I have a reputation for derailing conversations with sauna talk. As I rattled on, Yukinoshita tilted her head thoughtfully. I like that earnest side of her. 

""Hokuou's curry... You don't mean a Northern European style curry with a brown sauce or fond de veau base, instead of an Indian-style spice curry?"" 

""Wrong. I'm not trying to have a debate about the difference between 'Bondy' and 'Ethiopia'.""

""Ethiopia...? As in, African curry?""

Now Yukinoshita tilted her head in the other direction. If I were to say something like, ""The curry at 'Alaska' is great too!"" I'd probably just confuse her even more, so I decided to just go with it. 

""Yeah. That's more or less it."" 

""You just don't want to explain, do you?"" 

Yukinoshita puffed out her cheeks and gave my shoulder a soft, fluffy cat-punch. 

""Ow...""

It didn't hurt at all, of course, but I said it out of courtesy. Yukinoshita pressed her fingers to her temples as if fighting off a headache and sighed in exasperation. 

""You like curry too, don't you..."" 

""Everyone does. What, do you happen to dislike it?"" 

""I've never really thought about it that deeply... But the Thai curry we had with Yuigahama and the others the other day was quite to my liking."" 

""...Ah, Thai curry."" 

""That's a weird reaction.""

Sensing the sudden drop in my tone, Yukinoshita looked at me with a puzzled expression.

 ""Well, yeah. I mean, that stuff was fine, but... the cilantro was a bit much..."" 

As I mumbled, Yukinoshita blinked in surprise, then let out a small laugh. ""You don't like cilantro? You have a cute side, don't you?"" 

Her teasing smile was so disarming that I immediately launched into a rapid-fire defense. 

""It's not that I don't like it. It's just... when you eat it, it's just so... ugh, you know?"" 

""So you do dislike it."" 

""No, 'dislike' isn't a strong enough word. I'm at the point where I'd kill it on sight."" 

""That's a much deeper-seated hatred than I imagined...""

Yukinoshita was taken aback, but people who can't stand cilantro really can't stand it... ""Are you not good with things that have strong scents or flavors? You dislike tomatoes and cucumbers too... Oh, what about crown daisies or celery?"" 

""I don't mind those. In fact, I like them. The aroma and bitterness are nice."" 

Crown daisies are delicious both raw and in hot pot, and celery is great with just a bit of mayonnaise. Even pickled celery is nice. For a more unusual twist, celery ramen is surprisingly good. As I explained this, Yukinoshita furrowed her brow. 

""Your tastes are difficult, Hikigaya-kun..."" 

""Tell me about it. I still don't even understand my own preferences.""

I can handle sweet and spicy things, and stuff that people usually find annoying or too rich, I sometimes think, ""Well, in its own way, this is actually kind of amazing..."" 

As I was pondering this, Yukinoshita suddenly murmured, ""I wonder if we'd find out more if we asked Komachi-san..."" 

""Absolutely not"", that's way too embarrassing. 

If I get home and Komachi says to me, ""So, someone asked about what you dislike... Should I give them the same old answer, 'people'?"" I don't think I could bear it. My current self is cringey enough, but my second-year-of-middle-school self was on a whole other level of painful. I do not need those memories dredged up. So, naturally, I deflected. 

""Anyway, let's put my preferences aside... let's get back on topic. Right, we were talking about how good curry is after a sauna."" 

""We're not getting back on topic at all... Weren't we talking about prep schools? Your head really is a l√∂yly...""

""Stop using l√∂yly as an insult. And you're not one to talk. You get a completely different look in your eye when you talk about cats or Pan-san."" 

""That's perfectly normal. Everyone loves cats and Pan-san, right? Even you like cats, Hikigaya-kun."" 

""Right? You're on Team Cat, right?"" 

When she said it with such forceful, huffing conviction, I had no choice but to nod. I mean, it's not just cats; I like dogs, ferrets, rabbits, and tanukis too. I generally like all non-human animals... but this wasn't the atmosphere to say that. 

""Well, yeah, but... my point was that you can get pretty intense about things."" 

At my words, Yukinoshita fell silent, then cleared her throat once. 

""...Well, I suppose we all tend to get a little passionate when it comes to our interests. Let us strive to respect each other's hobbies as much as possible."" 

""Uh, yeah. Right...""

She's good, trying to smooth things over with a prim, adult-like smile and a formal declaration... Even I can't be that blatantly evasive... As I stood there in awe, Yukinoshita raised a small hand. 

""Therefore, I have a proposal."" 

""Why the sudden politeness...? Well, go on."" 

As I prompted her to continue, Yukinoshita straightened her posture. 

""Considering our discussion about our likes, dislikes, and hobbies, I believe that a certain degree of mutual understanding between us will be indispensable moving forward.""

 ""Yeah, okay, I guess so..."" 

What is she suddenly going on about...? I thought, but I still nodded along. As I waited for her to continue, Yukinoshita chose her words carefully. 

""What if we were to find a middle ground between your interests and mine... and go to Destinyland?"" 

""Oh, I see... wait, I don't see at all. A middle ground between what and what?"" 

When I asked, Yukinoshita replied nonchalantly. 

""Between Chiba and Pan-san."" 

""That seems a little biased towards Pan-san's side... And wait, you think my hobby is 'Chiba'?""

What the heck is 'hobby: Chiba'... When I made a sour face, Yukinoshita let out a small, teasing giggle. 

""Oh, am I wrong? You always talk about it so passionately."" 

""You are wrong. Chiba isn't a hobby. It's a way of life. Don't try to box it in with such a simple word."" 

""I-I see... Your usual behavior makes it hard to tell if you're joking or not..."" 

Yukinoshita seemed taken aback, but rest assured, I was only half-joking. Which means the other half was serious, so I guess it's no wonder she's weirded out... 

""Besides, didn't we just go to Destinyland for the school trip? Can't we go somewhere else?"" At that, Yukinoshita's brow furrowed in a troubled expression. 

""Pan-san's character greeting event is starting next holiday weekend. I think it's going to become a permanent event, but there's been no official announcement, so I want to go now. Contributing to the first week's attendance figures will help support Pan-san...""

The Pan-san fanatic was now rambling at high speed. Her concern went beyond mere fandom and into the realm of marketing. This was getting a little scary. Is she the type to throw huge amounts of money at her faves? Oh no, I'm suddenly worried about her future! I must protect her... As these selfish thoughts ran through my head, I fell silent and just nodded along. Seeing this, Yukinoshita seemed to get a little flustered and added hastily, tugging on my sleeve. 

""Ah, it's not just Destinyland, there's a place like this nearby, too..."" 

She smoothly presented her phone, and on the screen was the website for a certain spa facility. It was a place I'd been curious about for a while, so I recognized it instantly. 

""...Ah, this place."" 

""You know it?"" 

""I know of it. Never been. I heard their Kero sauna is amazing, so I've been interested...""

Kero... It's from Finland, the home of sauna, a rare type of wood known as the ""jewel of the forest."" This spa was famous for its Kero sauna, but it also had multiple other saunas and an open-air bath with natural spring water. It was a paradise for sauna lovers. 

""Whoa, this place looks incredible. I really want to go..."" 

As I leaned in to get a closer look at the phone, Yukinoshita, beside me, smiled a little proudly. 

""Right? Apparently, the 'View Sauna,' which comes as a set with the stone sauna, is co-ed. So I thought we could stop by on the way back.""

""Hmm... a View Sauna. Whoa, getting to relax while looking at a beautiful view, that sounds amazing... It looks like it has a l√∂yly too, it's perfect‚Äîwait a second? What? What did you just say?"" 

I was so engrossed in the sauna info that I'd completely missed what she said. Did she just say something incredible? I instinctively looked at Yukinoshita twice. When our eyes met, Yukinoshita's cheeks flushed a deep crimson, and she quickly looked away. Still facing away from me, she fanned her cheeks and whispered in a broken, choppy voice. 

""I mean, Hikigaya-kun, you like saunas, so... I thought it would be nice if we could go somewhere... together... that's all I thought..."" 

Then, she peeked back at my reaction, a shy, bashful smile on her face. And then, without a word, she tilted her head as if to ask, ""So?""

Seeing that, I buried my face in my hands. This girl, seriously... You can't just do that... Didn't I tell you before that my reason dies when you do things like that? I haven't, have I? Well, I should... There's no way around it. Later, when I get home, I'm going to write a ""Last Will and Testament of My Sanity"" and get my affairs in order... Sorry, Sanity. It's okay‚Äîno, it's not okay. It was for the best. Thanks to a calm, internal dialogue with my own reason, I managed to regain some of my composure. 

""...Ah, yes, that is. I am most grateful for your consideration. I believe that would be most excellent..."" 

Oh no, I haven't calmed down at all! I'm bowing and scraping like a fool! I thought, starting to panic, but Yukinoshita was just as flustered, returning my bow with a deep one of her own. 

""N-no, not at all, the pleasure is all mine..."" 

Then, we looked at each other and shared a small, bittersweet smile. 

""So, we'll go sometime. To relax..."" 

""Yes, to relax.""

We both uttered the magic words for any student preparing for exams, like a mutual get-out-of-jail-free card. 

""The holidays will be crowded, so maybe the week after. I'm pretty much free my whole life, so I can match your schedule."" 

""That sounds good. In that case, on this day..."" 

As she spoke, Yukinoshita swiftly circled a date in her planner. I entered the plan into my phone's calendar as well. However, if we're calling it ""relaxing,"" that implies we have to work hard until then. Suppressing my giddy feelings, I spread open my reference book. 

""For now, shall we study...?""

If I didn't declare it, we'd probably end up talking forever. As I picked up my pen, Yukinoshita nodded firmly and took her own mechanical pencil in hand. The pleasant rhythm of our pens gliding across paper blended with the BGM playing in the cafe, and a quiet moment flowed by. But that moment was fleeting. 

Yukinoshita suddenly stopped her pen and reached for her planner. She opened it to the current month and circled the day of our planned outing with a pink marker. Unconsciously, she started humming softly, and began writing something with a colored pen. A quick glance revealed she was planning out the day, from departure times to things she wanted to do. Well, I'll leave the planning to her... As for me, I had my own difficult question to tackle. I was faced with this problem. 

Fill in the blank below with the feelings you hold for her. Consider the most appropriate expression, and write it in your own words, using two to five characters.

**References and Translator's Notes** 

***Cultural and General Notes*** 

‚óè **Prep School (‰∫àÂÇôÊ†° - Yobik≈ç):** These are private cram schools that high school students in Japan often attend after their regular school day to prepare for the rigorous university entrance exams. Attending trial lessons is a common way to choose one. 

‚óè **University Entrance Exams:** This is a major, high-stress event in a Japanese student's life. The story is set during the lead-up to these exams, which explains the characters' focus on studying. 

‚óè **Gakubu (Â≠¶ÈÉ®):** This refers to a university faculty or department (e.g., Faculty of Law, Faculty of Engineering). Hachiman's complaint is about a real-world trend in Japan where universities create departments with long, trendy, and often vague-sounding names in English-style katakana to attract students. 

***Specific Terminology and Nuances*** 

**‚óè Kaig≈çsh≈´ (‰ºöÂêàË°Ü) and Toshiyori (Âπ¥Ë°åÂè∏):** These are specific terms from Japanese history, referring to councils of influential merchants that governed cities like Sakai during the Muromachi period (1336-1573). This detail establishes that Hachiman is studying for a history exam. 

‚óè **L√∂yly („É≠„Ç¶„É™„É•„Ç¶ - r≈çry≈´):** This is a Finnish word for the steam that is created by pouring water on hot stones in a sauna. In Japan, the act of creating this steam is a popular part of the sauna experience. In the story, it's used metaphorically: 

‚óã Yukino asks if Hachiman's head is a ""l√∂yly,"" implying it's full of hot air or steam (nonsensical ideas). 

‚óã Hachiman retorts that she is the ""l√∂yly"" for ""throwing cold water"" on his ideas, cleverly playing on the literal meaning. 

‚óè **Sameshi („ÇµÈ£Ø):** A Japanese portmanteau of ""sauna"" („Çµ„Ç¶„Éä) and ""meshi"" (È£Ø - meal/food). It refers to the delicious food one eats after a sauna session. 

‚óè **Hokuou (ÂåóÊ¨ß):** Literally means ""Northern Europe."" In this context, it refers to a famous, real-life sauna and spa complex in Ueno, Tokyo, well-known among sauna enthusiasts in Japan. 

‚óè **Bondy, Ethiopia, Alaska:** These are names of famous, real-life curry restaurants in Tokyo, each with a distinct style. Hachiman uses them as examples to show he's not talking about a specific culinary classification but something else entirely. 

‚óè **Kero Sauna („Ç±„É≠„Çµ„Ç¶„Éä):** A type of high-end sauna built with Kelo wood, a rare, slow-grown pine from the Arctic Circle. Its inclusion shows Hachiman is a genuine sauna connoisseur.

1mv4fvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1mv4fvu/8_days_free_of_ff/,8 Days Free of FF,"I had been taking FF on and off for the past 3 years when I learned about it on a wellness podcast. This product was marketed as a ""natural"" supplement that would help you stay focused during your work day. I started buying the monthly 12 pack subscription and that was before they put the serving on the bottles LOL. I rationalized paying for these mud drinks as another supplement which would aid in my health journey. However, the chokehold FF had on me was undeniable. It got to a point where my husband forced me to quit earlier this year because of how crazy I would act when running low, sneaking away to the gas station, etc. But my addiction won out and I had been secretly still taking FF behind his back up until a week ago. I was off FF for about a month in January and had ""one more"" in February and I've been struggling this year to quit. I will say this year is probably the least amount I have taken FF so the withdrawals haven't been as severe for me personally. 

What I find most fucked up is that on the podcast where they interview the founder of FF, they ask if the product is addicting. The founder says something along the lines of ""no more than coffee."" So when using FF, I would always convince myself that it's habitual or better for you compared to alcohol.

When I found out FF was being sold at my local gas station at 2 for $15 (what a steal compared to the vape stores that sold it for $11.99 per bottle!), I was stoked. Thinking about it now, I should have realized they only sell junk at gas stations and vape stores, wellness drinks would never be found there. These drinks impacted my relationships, motivation, work (almost got put on a PIP and had no clue what was wrong with me). My sister started sending me tiktoks on how addicting they were but I continued to ignore the facts since I was blinded by the addiction.

Anywho, my side effects from quitting included insomnia, brain fog, low energy, anxiety, GI issues, restless leg, all of which have been talked about here. I think since I tapered off I didn't get the skin issues. Still somewhat feeling anxious, restless leg, GI ugh, at day 8 but each day gets better!! What helped me quit was trying to get my dose down to the recommended dosage (half the bottle) for a month prior to quitting and taking it at night compared to first thing in the day where I felt the urge to keep sipping. I picked a Monday to completely stop since Monday's are shit anyways and it felt like a clean start to the week. I took days off work (took Thursday and Friday off) following quitting which helped and went on vacation to get away from my environment. 

Some things I have found super helpful when detoxing: shower first thing in the morning and end it with a 30 second cold shower, eat kiwis in the morning and night, drink electrolytes, take magnesium + melatonin at night for the insomnia, put your legs up the wall for 20 minutes before you go to bed to help you relax, use a red light from amazon in your bedroom!, I've also been taking creatine to help with the brain health, sorry for the wellness tangent but it's just what helped me.

After weeks of contemplating, my bf and I ordered Burnbox, and are going to try it out next week and complete their 3-day fast plan. 

I've read posts about Burnbox, so I've seen both good and bad reviews, however, all the bad ones seem to be directed at the price. We realize we are paying for convenience, but we love that we don't have to prep anything ourselves, so this seems to be exactly what we need with our busy lives and schedules. 

I'd love to hear/read responses from anyone who has had a positive experience with Burnbox, and if there are any useful tip or tricks. 

We've already committed to starting this next week, so I'd love to hear about the positive experiences mostly. I've read some negative ones, so I know they're out there, but since we're committed to doing this now, the good experience will help me maintain a positive mindset going into this. 

I also would love to know if anyone can tell me if I can still drink my Cirkul water bottle, or drink coffee with just monk fruit, stevia, splenda, etc. If I have to give up my crutches, I will üòÖ.

I want to do this right, but I'm worried about drinking enough water without my Cirkul bottle, because drinking enough water has been a struggle for me my whole life.

Part2

For some time now, I've been conducting a strange experiment.

I send newspapers to my relatives. For example, I take a copy of the Sequoyah Daily Tribune and mail it to my cousin in Atlanta. Three times in a row, he called me back to say he hadn't received anything. Not ‚Äúlost in the mail,‚Äù no. Nothing. It was as if I had put the letter in an empty mailbox.

One evening, I took a clear photo of the newspaper, with the date and headline, and sent it by text message to a college friend who now lives in Florida. The photo was sent. But when he replied, his message sent a chill down my spine:

""Why did you send me a completely black image? Is your phone bugging out?""

I went back to my photos: at my place, the picture appeared perfectly. At his place, nothing but a blank screen, a black image, as if Sequoyah couldn't cross borders.

So I tried again with something else. A photo of my license plate. Same result: he saw only a dark, empty surface.

I was starting to lose my footing.

Will, my childhood friend, had also noticed some anomalies. Since closing his souvenir shop, he had started working at the municipal library. And there, things were getting even stranger.

‚ÄúBrenda, did you know that entire books are missing from our shelves?‚Äù he confided in me one evening, clutching his jacket as if someone were listening.

‚ÄúMissing? Stolen?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Worse. They're there... but the titles have changed. The geography encyclopedias, for example. In the old editions, Sequoyah appears on the maps. In the more recent ones, he's disappeared. As if the printing itself had been corrected.‚Äù

He had taken out an old, dusty atlas to show me. Inside, between Tennessee and North Carolina, our state was clearly marked, bordered by mountains and valleys, with Gist as its capital. But in a school textbook printed in 2018, there was nothing. Instead, there was a clear border, as if Sequoyah had never existed.

I didn't sleep that night.

I started digging through local archives. Old newspapers from Gist talk about national events: Lincoln's election, Pearl Harbor, Kennedy's assassination. It's all there. But if you go online and search for the same news stories? Nothing mentions Sequoyah. It's as if we were... erased from the main narrative.

One detail still haunts me. In a yellowed article from 1871, just after our state was created, one sentence was underlined by hand:

‚ÄúThe Union officially recognizes the territory of Sequoyah, provided that its status remains temporary.‚Äù

Temporary.

What did that word mean?

In recent weeks, I've noticed something else. The roads are changing.

I got into the habit of going for a run in the morning along Highway 74. But one day, it was gone. Well, not in the same way. Where I had always seen a long ribbon of asphalt, there was now only a narrow, poorly paved country road that wound strangely. The road signs had also changed: Gist now appeared only half-erased, the letters bleached white, as if scraped away by an invisible hand.

I asked my aunt if she had noticed. She looked at me with a kind of resignation.:

‚ÄúBrenda... stop thinking about it. You can't fight it.‚Äù

Her voice wasn't harsh or cold. It was worse than that. It had the weariness of a secret too heavy to bear, the resignation of someone who had long since given up fighting.

I froze, the cup still in my hands.

‚ÄúFight what?‚Äù I insisted.

My aunt didn't answer right away. She stood motionless, her back turned, her hands resting on the counter, as if she were gathering the strength to speak. I thought she was finally going to confide in me, but instead, her shoulders slumped a little more, crushed by an invisible burden.

‚ÄúAunt Lydia... what do you mean?‚Äù

I stepped behind the counter to face her, but she looked away. Her eyes, usually bright and piercing, seemed evasive, almost lifeless. She had that look I've seen in people at the end of their lives: no fear, no anger, just a kind of cold acceptance.

She finally whispered, so softly that I had to lean in:

‚ÄúThere are some things... that are better forgotten.‚Äù

Those words cut through me like a knife.

‚ÄúBut forget what?‚Äù I asked, my throat dry. ‚ÄúForget who? Ally? Will? Do you really think it's a coincidence that they disappeared?‚Äù ""

Lydia closed her eyes, and her lips trembled, as if she were fighting the urge to beg me to shut up. Finally, she just whispered:

‚ÄúThe more you care, the more they notice you.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúThey?‚Äù

Her gaze suddenly fixed on me, and for a second I thought I saw pure terror in her eyes. But she immediately turned her head away, mechanically grabbing a rag to wipe down a table that was already clean.

‚ÄúDon't ask questions, Brenda.‚Äù Her voice had regained a forced coldness, as if she were reciting a long-learned role. ‚ÄúDrink your coffee and forget about it. You'll be safer that way.‚Äù

I watched her for a long time, the heavy silence between us, before she finally turned away. Her hunched back, her tense neck... as if every word she hadn't said had pushed her a little further into an invisible prison.

I think that's when I realized: my aunt knew something. And what she knew frightened her so much that she preferred to leave me in the dark rather than risk saying one word too many.

But once you've heard that kind of silence... you can never forget it.

And then... there was last night.

I was in the caf√©, alone, closing up. I heard a loud noise outside, like a car stopping suddenly. When I went outside, I saw headlights shining in the middle of the road, the engine still running. Inside: no one.

But the passenger door was open.

As I approached, I saw something disturbing on the seat: a phone still on, displaying a GPS.

The screen clearly showed: North Carolina.

And just below, flashing red: Recalculating... recalculating...

The strangest thing was that this phone didn't show my city. Where Gist should have been, there was only a large gray spot, a digital void.

I picked it up, trembling. On the home screen, there was a photo as the wallpaper. It was Ally. The same woman.

So I ask the question: how did her phone end up back here, alone, a year after she disappeared?

I kept it. It's sitting on my table. The battery should have died long ago, but it never drops below 50%.

And ten minutes ago, it vibrated. A notification appeared, out of nowhere:

‚ÄúBrenda, get out of Sequoyah. While there's still time.‚Äù

The problem is that the screen displayed the message as if it came from... my own number...",1,1755661716.0,u_Bdx33lr,0,1.0,False
1mv4b5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1mv4b5e/exclusivity_talk_went_sideways/,Exclusivity talk went sideways,"TLDR; I (early 30's M) brought up the topic of exclusivity to the girl I'm seeing (late 20's F) and she said she wants to keep dating explore what she likes in other people, since she came out of a 5 year relationship very recently (\~9 months ago). I don't feel good about that.

We met a month ago over an app. I feel there's a great deal of compatibility and chemistry between us. We've been to around 10 dates -- I lost count tbh --, big and small, some of them in each others' houses. Things got steamy multiple times. 

Recently, she said she wanted to talk about the thing between us. We spoke about recently relationship history, plans with kids, and so on. She got on top of me before I could talk about exclusivity, I just went with it and didn't bring it up.

I saw her today, I breached the topic finally. Was so sure of it I started it as ""do we even have to talk about exclusivity at that point"". Her face made a complete 180, and explained yes, and said she's been on dates with other people in the past month, but got nowhere near intimate with any of them. As I said in TLDR, she wants to see what she likes in other people and wants to keep dating.

To be perfectly honest, this makes two of us. I did have 2 coffee dates in the same time period with other people, but it is mostly because I set those up before exclusivity crossed my mind, and went with it since I know we didn't have the ""conversation"". I lost pretty much all my interest to pursue other people 2 weeks ago, and given how things are progressing, it felt the right thing to do.

But now I'm lost. I exhibit anxious attachment patterns, and am going to way overthink every single text that comes in longer than expected, every single day that she's not available to see me from this point now on. Even if I'm able to force her hand succesfully on this, it feels like this is going to be a problem in the long run.

Honestly, I feel like the best way to handle this is to just stopping seeing each other until she makes her mind up about it, if she would at all. And I really really don't want to do that.

Is there a way to save this, or do I write this off as ""right people, wrong time""?

Okay, I'm probably not the first person to figure this out (and I'd LOVE to hear if you've discovered similar tricks!), but I'm genuinely buzzing about this discovery and had to share!

You know that frustrating moment when you're deep into a ChatGPT conversation and suddenly it's like... did this thing just forget how to think? üòÖ It starts repeating itself, loses the thread, or gives you answers that make you go ""wait, what?""

Turns out there's actually a name for this: context corruption. The longer the chat, the more the AI's ""brain"" gets cluttered with conversational debris.

So I got fed up and started experimenting with what I'm calling the **Squash Rollback** method (terrible name, I know ‚Äì please help me rename it üòÇ):

Here's the magic:

1. You're jamming with ChatGPT, brainstorming away. After 10-15 exchanges, you've actually landed on 3 brilliant insights buried in all that back-and-forth.
2. **Squash** time! Instead of letting that messy conversation drag you down, pause and distill those gems into a crystal-clear summary.
3. **Rollback!** Open a fresh chat, paste your clean summary, and watch the AI spring back to life like it just had coffee ‚òï

**Real example from my last session:**

After a looooong rambling conversation about content strategy, I had this hot mess of ideas floating around. But buried in there were three solid gold nuggets:

My Squash Summary is as follows:

* Target SEO long-tail keywords for better organic reach
* Include real-world case studies to build credibility
* Add JSON schema snippets for technical implementation

Fresh chat ‚Üí paste summary ‚Üí ""Help me turn these into a detailed action plan""

AND IT WORKED LIKE MAGIC!  Suddenly I had a focused, sharp AI again instead of a confused rambling bot. Quite amazing to me.

Why this works:

* Strips away all the conversational ""junk food""
* Gives the AI a clean slate while preserving your actual progress
* It's like hitting ctrl+z on brain fog!

I'm honestly kicking myself for not trying this sooner ‚Äì my productivity with AI tools has legit gone through the roof!

Has anyone else stumbled onto something like this? Or am I reinventing the wheel here? üòÖ Either way, I'm curious to hear your own hacks for keeping these conversations sharp!

I offer to walk her back and she gladly accepts but says, ‚Äúwould‚Äôve been a classic one night stand if I had to walk back alone‚Äù or along those lines. This makes me think her mind was made up at this point it was just another one night stand but I just thought that we would hang out again and in the excitement of the night it just led to that.

I‚Äôm immediately left with confusion as to seeing how she‚Äôs already trying to cut things off it seems. I just assume she really is busy but I know what that means. After a while I hit her up again to say how I really enjoyed hanging out and would love to do it again. She tells me that she‚Äôs glad I reached out but doesn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs in the place for a relationship or anything and we‚Äôd have to hang out as friends. I agree to anyways because I genuinely liked her company and maybe assume she‚Äôs shit testing to see how I‚Äôll reply? I tell her that‚Äôs fine with me and we should grab coffee.

Trace Wolfe killed the engine and listened to it tick.

The 1999 Ford Ranger shuddered once, then fell quiet, the old manual transmission winding down with a lazy whine. The truck had been his since high school, gifted from his father, and though its paint had dulled and its odometer turned long past respectable, the machine still carried the weight of memory. His father‚Äôs hand on his shoulder the day he drove it off the lot. His father‚Äôs laugh when he ground the gears learning stick for the first time. His father‚Äôs silence, gone five years now, leaving Trace with only ghosts and steel.

The summer evening pressed heavy on Memphis. Humidity clung like a second skin, a storm front shouldering the horizon with bruised clouds. Heat radiated from the asphalt, carrying the faint, bitter tang of oil and hot metal. The Ranger‚Äôs cab smelled of sweat, dust, and the leather cleaner Trace had used religiously, though it hadn‚Äôt been new leather in a long time.

He sat a moment longer, hands loose on the wheel, staring through the cracked windshield. Thirty-five years old, sore from another shift inspecting industrial panels, and feeling every day of it. His shoulders ached with the weight of hours bent over wiring and steel. His palms carried the calluses of years spent as mechanic, welder, blacksmith before that. Once, he‚Äôd dreamed of work that left room for more than exhaustion. Now he dreamed only of the chair waiting upstairs, and the screen that promised escape.

The storm cracked in the distance, a low growl rolling over rooftops. Trace sighed, shut the truck door, and climbed the narrow stairwell to his apartment.

Inside, the air was still, touched with the faint ozone of electronics. His apartment was neat in the way of someone who lived alone too long: everything in its place, nothing in excess. A desk of dark wood, scarred from years of use. A shelf of well-worn paperbacks: Halo: The Fall of Reach, Mass Effect: Ascension, Destiny: The Taken King lore anthology. Above them, a rack of tools hung like an altar‚Äîwrenches, soldering irons, a welder‚Äôs mask. Life and escape, side by side.

Trace dropped his keys in a dish by the door, peeled off his work shirt, and sat at his desk. His rig dominated the space, a custom-built tower glowing faintly blue through tempered glass. Cables snaked in careful order, a HOTAS throttle and joystick set beside a mechanical keyboard. Dual monitors waited in black silence.

He touched the power button. Fans whirred, lights pulsed to life, and the room filled with the soft hum of booting hardware. The storm outside dimmed to a low percussion against glass, syncing with the rise of electronic heartbeat.

Trace leaned back, exhaling slow. This was the moment that never lost its edge. The shift from dull reality to something more. He pulled on his headset, bass already thumping with tonight‚Äôs playlist‚ÄîEDM, heavy with synths, the kind that pulsed like engines spooling up. Some nights it was metal, others the hymnal ache of Christian rock his father had left him, still others the raw punch of industrial. But tonight, he needed the hum of thrusters, the promise of speed.

The Star Citizen launcher blinked onto his screen. Loading bar crawled forward, slow as it always did, but anticipation coiled tight in his chest.

When the menus unfurled, he clicked without hesitation. His hangar expanded across the screen‚Äîfloodlit, cavernous, metal glinting under white brilliance. And there she was.

The Pelican 314.

Trace‚Äôs ship stood ready in the bay, sleek and beautiful. Crusader Industries‚Äô Mercury Star Runner, lines smooth as if carved by wind. Deep navy-blue livery gleamed beneath the hangar lights, painted and repainted in hours of tinkering. The name stenciled in white along her flank was simple, unpretentious: Pelican 314.

It wasn‚Äôt the biggest ship he owned in-game, nor the deadliest. But it was his. His blood and hours, his every credit saved, his every late-night cargo run. It had carried him through the universe when nothing else had. It was freedom. It was memory. And it was home.

He smiled despite himself.

Sliding into the cockpit view, he let the HUD swallow his monitors. His hands rested on the HOTAS, muscle memory tracing throttle and yaw. The chair creaked under him, familiar and grounding. He whispered it under his breath, as always: ‚ÄúLaunch.‚Äù

The hangar doors parted. Engines hummed, then roared, the sound rattling through his headset. Light spilled across the cockpit glass as the Pelican rose, carried into the throat of the bay. Beyond, stars scattered across black, endless and bright.

Trace‚Äôs chest tightened‚Äînot fear, but something like longing. Here, he wasn‚Äôt thirty-five and exhausted. Here, he wasn‚Äôt a man trapped in the small gravity of his father‚Äôs absence and the slow grind of work. Here, he was pilot. Explorer. Someone with control.

His phone buzzed on the desk.

Trace frowned, pulled it closer. Screen black. No notification. But as he stared, a ripple passed across the glass‚Äîfaint light, blue-white, like veins threading across dark stone. For half a second, he thought he saw letters forming.

Then nothing.

He blinked. ‚ÄúGlitchy piece of junk,‚Äù he muttered. The iPhone had been solid since he bought it, but lately‚Ä¶ strange. Overheating, flickers, lights where there should be none.

He set it back down. The monitor glow reflected in its surface, making it look like another HUD panel.

His HUD expanded to a full starfield, the Pelican breaking free of the hangar throat. Engines burned steady. Space unfolded before him.

The storm cracked again outside, rattling the window. Lights flickered in his apartment‚Äîjust once, then steady again. Trace‚Äôs pulse hitched.

He eased the throttle forward. The Pelican surged, stars sliding across the canopy. He breathed deep, headset thundering with music, and for a moment the walls of the apartment seemed thinner.

His phone buzzed again. This time, the glow lingered‚Äîthreads of blue crawling across the screen in slow, deliberate arcs, as if veins of light had begun to root in the glass.

Trace froze.

The HUD flickered, momentarily stuttering. Then the phone‚Äôs glow died, leaving silence and shadow.

Trace shook his head, muttered under his breath, and gripped the stick tighter. Whatever it was could wait. He had stars to chase.

The Pelican 314 slid into the void, engines purring.

And behind him, on the desk, his phone pulsed once more, faint but steady, as if keeping time with the beat of his heart.

üìñ Prologue: 
Final Logoff



Chunk 2 ‚Äî The Fracture


The stars bent.

One moment, Trace‚Äôs monitors showed the simulated canopy, the gentle crawl of a galaxy. The next, the screen warped, the edges of the HUD distorting as if someone had grabbed reality and twisted.

Trace leaned forward, heart tripping. His rig‚Äôs fans spun louder, a grinding pitch that didn‚Äôt sound right. Static hissed in his headset, then the throb of his EDM track slowed, warped, like a tape dragged through water.

‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî‚Äù

The phone on his desk pulsed blue, light spilling in brighter arcs, brighter than any notification should ever be. The glass crawled with lines of text too fast to read, symbols dissolving into numbers, then into star maps he half-recognized.

The HUD shook. His chair shook. For a wild second he thought it was the storm outside, power lines humming with a surge. But no‚Äîthe vibration was in his chest, in the soles of his feet, in the bones of his teeth.

Then the cockpit filled his vision.

Not the screen‚Äîthe cockpit.

The familiar smell of his apartment‚Äîdust, ozone, faint leather cleaner‚Äîvanished in a rush of recycled oxygen, sharp and metallic. His hands, clamped on the HOTAS, were gripping not plastic, but steel flight controls, worn smooth by use that wasn‚Äôt his. Every panel around him glowed, alive, switches and readouts blinking in sequence. The seat pressed into his back, contoured, padded, real.

Trace‚Äôs breath hitched, fogging the canopy glass.

This wasn‚Äôt his apartment.

The stars were no longer pixels. They were burning pinpricks in a vast black sky that went on forever.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äî‚Äù His voice caught in his throat.

Alarms shrieked.

The canopy flashed with red warnings. MISSILE LOCK DETECTED.

Trace‚Äôs pulse slammed into overdrive. He tore the stick sideways on instinct, the Pelican rolling hard. His stomach dropped, his body dragged against the harness that hadn‚Äôt been there seconds ago. A missile streaked past his wing, trailing fire before bursting into fragments.

‚ÄúPirates.‚Äù The word left his lips like a curse.

Three Cutlass Blacks clawed across his scope, their engines glowing hot against the void. Their guns spat streams of tracer fire that painted the black with golden rain. Shields flared as shots chewed across his bow, rippling like struck water.

Trace‚Äôs mouth went dry. This wasn‚Äôt a game. There was no respawn, no hangar reset. His ship wasn‚Äôt wireframe‚Äîit was steel and fuel and him inside it.

Another lock screamed. Trace jerked the stick, the Pelican thrumming as it dove, shields flaring bright. He felt the vibration through his spine, through his teeth.

The dorsal turret rotated on its own. He hadn‚Äôt touched the controls.

And it fired.

A stream of blue-white bolts lanced upward, stitching across the lead pirate. The Cutlass spiraled, wing blown away, flames licking vacuum before it spun into debris.

Trace‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle busy here,‚Äù a voice snapped. Female. Sharp. Sarcastic. ‚ÄúHope you don‚Äôt mind I borrowed the turret.‚Äù

Trace‚Äôs blood froze.

‚ÄúWho‚Äîwho the hell is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLater. Fly.‚Äù

Another missile shrieked across his canopy. Trace yanked the stick, his body slammed by inertia, lungs crushed against the harness. Sweat blurred his vision. He banked hard, skimming the edge of a drifting asteroid, the Pelican‚Äôs shields scraping sparks against the rock.

The ventral turret roared, twin bolts catching another pirate square in the cockpit. The ship exploded, shards scattering like shattered glass across black.

Trace‚Äôs heart hammered. His fingers shook on the stick, knuckles white. ‚ÄúThis‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúFocus, flyboy.‚Äù The voice purred now, amused despite the chaos. ‚ÄúLast bandit‚Äôs still behind you.‚Äù

Trace‚Äôs HUD blinked, lock warning escalating into a scream. The third Cutlass bore down, missiles primed, its silhouette a vulture against the stars.

Trace swallowed hard. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ okay‚Ä¶‚Äù

He slammed the throttle, engines howling, the Pelican surging forward. The stars streaked. He jinked left, right, weaving through debris fields and missile trails.

The voice cut in again, quick and sharp. ‚ÄúThirty degrees up, then cut engines on my mark.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? That‚Äôs suicide.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me.‚Äù

Another lock tone. Trace‚Äôs throat closed.

‚ÄúNow!‚Äù

He yanked back on the stick, angled the nose up, and slammed the throttle idle. The Pelican bucked, momentum hurling him forward, body straining against straps. The pirate screamed past overhead, overshooting his vector.

‚ÄúGotcha,‚Äù the voice whispered.

The ventral turret fired. Twin bolts ripped into the pirate‚Äôs engines. The Cutlass blossomed in fire, torn apart in silence, fragments scattering into forever.

The warning tones died.

Trace‚Äôs chest heaved, every nerve screaming. Sweat poured down his back, soaking his shirt. He loosened his grip on the stick, hands trembling.

The comm crackled, silent except for his own ragged breathing. The stars burned indifferent. His ship drifted, shields flickering.

And then, softly, the voice again.

‚ÄúSee? We make a pretty good team.‚Äù

Trace stared at the canopy, at the debris drifting past. His voice came raw. ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù

A pause. Almost playful. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you like to know.‚Äù

Then silence.

Trace‚Äôs eyes flicked down to the console. His phone‚Äîjammed into a data port when the chaos started‚Äîstill glowed faint blue, threads of light crawling across the glass like veins.

Something was inside his ship. Inside his ship.

And it wasn‚Äôt leaving.

üìñ Prologue: Final Logoff

Chunk 3 ‚Äî Chi Ceti IV

The jump tore him into ribbon and decided, at the last second, to be merciful.

Light became pressure became nothing. Then the harness slammed the air out of his chest and the Pelican 314 bucked like a spooked animal reappearing inside its own skin. Trace‚Äôs stomach tried to keep going while the rest of him snapped back into place. He gagged once, twice, dragged a breath through a throat full of static.

The canopy held a world.

Blue oceans. Brown-green continents braided with river silver. Cloud-bands curling like white script around a globe too large to ignore. Sunlight made a hard coin out of its limb. Not Stanton. Not Sol.

Somewhere else‚Äîso utterly itself that denial felt childish.

He lifted a shaking hand and coaxed the Pelican‚Äôs nose up, bleeding momentum until the altitude marker stopped screaming and the atmosphere‚Äôs invisible hand loosened at the shield bubble. Systems cascaded from angry red to sulky amber.

QUANTUM DRIVE ‚Äî OFFLINE
HULL ‚Äî SCORCHING / MINOR ABRASIONS
SHIELDS ‚Äî RECALIBRATING (43%)

The comms were already there. Not just noise‚Äîvoices. Human. Clipped, too calm to be anything but trained.

‚Äú‚ÄîSpartans, break off and return to the Commonwealth. Priority one.‚Äù
‚ÄúMAC coil at eighty‚Äîno, eighty-two. One shot, make it count.‚Äù
‚ÄúSeraph squadrons‚Äîvector seven-by-twelve. Elevation‚Äî‚Äù

Trace‚Äôs breath hitched. Commonwealth. Spartans. The names lodged in him like old shrapnel that his body recognized before his mind gave permission.

He‚Äôd read this battle. He‚Äôd pictured it on a bedroom floor under a cheap lamp at two in the morning. He‚Äôd flattened dog-ears in those paperbacks and traced lines of dialogue with his thumb.

And here it was, talking over him.

The tactical feed staggered, then locked. A UNSC signature on the far side of the planet snapped into place: COMMONWEALTH. Opposite it‚Äîelegant, loathsome, inhuman‚Äîan alien hull curved like a scimitar, its ventral bays lit with molten breath. Covenant light carrier, shields bright enough to shame the sun.

Plasma lanced across the void in a slow, unstoppable river. Even half a world away, the sensor wash made Trace‚Äôs HUD flinch.

‚ÄúDeck seven venting‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúPlating‚Äôs blistering‚Äîtwo meters of titanium-A doesn‚Äôt mean‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúMAC coil at ninety‚Äîhold your positions!‚Äù

UNSC ships didn‚Äôt have shields. They never had‚Äînot here, not now. Just steel and prayer and the stubbornness to keep shooting. Hearing it was worse than reading it. The helplessness carried in the timbre more than the words.

Trace swallowed down the sudden urge to apologize to no one.

He should have been nothing, a smear of heat in high orbit. But the Pelican 314 drifted where it shouldn‚Äôt, wearing the faint shimmer of a shield bubble like contraband. He could feel attention turn without seeing it; the way you feel a room change when someone important walks in.

The phone he‚Äôd half-crammed into a diagnostics tray was still wedged by the throttle, its glass quietly breathing veins of blue-white. He realized, with a cold, tidy click, that whatever had puppeted his turrets against the pirates hadn‚Äôt been a proper link‚Äîmore a parasitic borrow, a bleed-through. A hand on the wheel, not a seat behind it.

A voice slid into his ear, thin as wire, amused as sin. ‚ÄúCongratulations. You survived your questionable life choices.‚Äù

He flinched so hard the harness squeaked. ‚ÄúWho‚Äîwhat are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúLater. Turn thirty degrees sunward unless you‚Äôre married to the idea of becoming plasma graffiti.‚Äù

He turned‚Äîon instinct, on an old habit of trusting the person who sounds like they already know the answers. A violet spear of heat sawed through where he‚Äôd been. The shield skin rippled, the sound of it a delicate hiss that made his teeth ache.

A quiet curse bled over a public UNSC channel, half-muted. ‚ÄúSir‚Äîconfirming anomalous reflection on that civilian. Our‚Äîour scopes show‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNot now,‚Äù an older voice cut. ‚ÄúLog it for ONI and focus. Spartans are inbound.‚Äù

Trace gripped the yoke until his knuckles went chalk white. He had spent years wishing he could be inside a story; now the story was looking back and counting his teeth. On the far side of the world, the carrier rotated with predatory patience. Its bays brightened to obscene, molten clarity.

‚ÄúDelta Romeo?‚Äù the voice in his cockpit prompted, dry as sun-baked chalk.

He blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to live, or do you just enjoy heavy breathing under pressure?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen plug me in. Properly this time.‚Äù

He glanced at the aux slot on the starboard console‚Äîthe real one with data pins and a physical lock. Not the lip of a tray where a phone could leech power and ride noise. The slot blinked green like an eye that had been open this whole time.

Every instinct screamed at him. You don‚Äôt jam unknowns into your engine. You don‚Äôt let mystery drive.

Another voice on UNSC command, brittle with adrenaline: ‚ÄúCaptain, Covenant carrier is‚Äîuh‚Äîshifting. It looks like something else got its attention.‚Äù

Something else. Him. The idea landed with a sick, cold weight.

‚ÄúTrace,‚Äù the voice said, dropping the sarcasm to a scalpel-fine thread of urgency. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

He tore the phone free and slid it into the starboard port. Magnets caught with a satisfying, terrible click. For a heartbeat nothing happened; the ship breathed, the world curved, plasma crawled across someone else‚Äôs sky.

Then the Pelican 314 woke up.

The cockpit light deepened into a cooler temperature, blue-white like arc welders. HUD elements crisped from ‚Äúgame clean‚Äù to ‚Äúsurgical.‚Äù Power busses rerouted themselves with the certainty of a hand that had done it before, always, forever. Capacitors sang‚Äîbright, hungry. Dorsal and ventral turrets rotated together like owls turning their heads.

Her voice‚Äîbecause there was no way to pretend it was mere sound now‚Äîcame through clear and close, confidence edged sharp. ‚ÄúStrap in.‚Äù

Three Seraphs sliced over the planet‚Äôs limb like throwing stars, vectors converging. The dorsal turret wrote a straight-line sentence across the nearest one, punctuation in bright, ruinous bursts. Shields flared. Metal went to glass. The craft tried to decide which way was forward and failed.

The ventral turret chased the second, patient and bored, firing a staccato that sounded like someone tapping a pencil exactly where it would be most annoying. The Seraph folded. The third widened its arc, reconsidering its life choices.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Trace asked, because it seemed like a good time to be stupid.

‚ÄúSomeone with standards,‚Äù she said, and it felt like a smile without teeth. ‚ÄúFly the bus. I‚Äôll shoot.‚Äù

The bus. He would have argued if his hands weren‚Äôt busy being an extension of a fuselage he suddenly trusted more than his own legs. He skimmed the high blue filament of the atmosphere, let gravity tug just enough to smear the Seraphs‚Äô clean turns, then kicked the nose and found the gap you only get when your enemy has to think like a manual.

Plasma flashed. Heat scuffed the shield skin. Warnings stacked neatly, politely.

SHIELDS ‚Äî 39%
PORT ENGINE ‚Äî TEMPERATURE HIGH (CAUTION)

UNSC wideband snapped his attention sideways. ‚ÄúUnidentified civilian craft, this is UNSC Destroyer Commonwealth. State your designation.‚Äù

Reflex rose up like old music. He almost said Trace Wolfe because it felt truer, more human‚Äîbut the chaos dragged his gamer past out of him faster than sense could keep up.

‚ÄúThis is‚ÄîDeathrun147,‚Äù he blurted, hating it the instant it was sound. ‚ÄúRegistry Pelican 314.‚Äù

Silence, two beats long. Then the clipped, inevitable translation of a machine called a navy: ‚ÄúAcknowledged, Deathrun147. Callsign Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven. Form on vector two-six-niner carom eight. You are drawing enemy attention. Stay mobile and stay clear of our firing solutions.‚Äù

Her laugh chimed through the ship like a thrown coin. ‚ÄúAlphabet soup. Look at you‚Äîofficial.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my name,‚Äù he muttered, hauling them down the vector. Atmosphere licked the shield skin, hiss like summer rain on a tin roof.

‚ÄúIt is to them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you Trace.‚Äù

He opened his mouth, closed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äîknow my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said it earlier. Screamed it, really. Implied context: ‚ÄòTrace, don‚Äôt be an idiot.‚Äô You were the audience.‚Äù

Heat shimmered; the horizon flexed. Seraphs tried to follow through friction and failed. The dorsal turret cupped a shot around one, ventral clipped another just as it began to find a solution. The wreckage wrote commas across the sky.

The Commonwealth spoke again, a different voice now‚Äîolder, with a steel edge that remembered cigarettes and bad coffee. ‚ÄúDelta Romeo One-Four-Seven, this is Captain Wallace. ONI will want what you‚Äôve got. Until they pry it from my cold hands, you fly our sky.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy,‚Äù Trace said, and surprise made it honest. ‚ÄúCopy, Captain.‚Äù

‚ÄúLive long enough to be debriefed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWorking on it.‚Äù

MAC coils wound up. He didn‚Äôt hear them so much as feel the universe make room. Across the far curve of the world, the carrier turned its wounded attention fully, ventral bays brightening until they hurt to look at. Trace felt small in a way he‚Äôd thought he knew from being human and wrong about the scale of things.

‚ÄúTrace.‚Äù Her voice again, softer, almost intimate inside the noise. ‚ÄúDo exactly what I say.‚Äù

He did‚Äîup two, drop three, wobble like he was blacking out, sell the easy kill. A Seraph dove with greed. The dorsal mount murdered it with one contemptuous burst.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre enjoying this,‚Äù he said, and it wasn‚Äôt an accusation.

‚ÄúI enjoy competence. Don‚Äôt make me regret investing.‚Äù

Alarms climbed. The carrier‚Äôs plasma torpedo launched, a slow sun uncoupling from a larger one. It carved a lazy arc meant to mock speed by making it irrelevant. His shield bubble would take it once, maybe, but the ship behind the bubble would not.

‚ÄúBrace,‚Äù she said, and the word made his hands sweat more than the torpedo did.

Dorsal and ventral weapons charged, amperage screaming down conduits in a way that would have made any engineer in him flinch. She fired them so the beams crossed, lancing the torpedo at a geometric center as impossible to eyeball as it was inevitable to calculate.

Light. Heat. The gut-deep whomp of a small sun deciding not to be born.

Trace blinked spots out of the world and found himself alive.

The Commonwealth‚Äôs comms forgot to be professional for half a second. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúTeamwork,‚Äù he heard himself say. His mouth was too dry for irony, but it came anyway.

‚ÄúGood hunting,‚Äù Captain Wallace said after a heartbeat. Professionalism returned and wore the smallest smile. ‚ÄúYou just bought us our shot.‚Äù

The MAC coil sang at the far edge of the sky. The slug moved like faith‚Äîseen only by its effects. The carrier‚Äôs shields flared to furious bloom and then, finally, failed. Tungsten cored the belly of a god and made it bleed.

Cheering burst over UNSC channels, human and ugly and perfect. Orders drowned it a beat later. Trace realized he was laughing, a cracked sound that felt like something loosening where fear had lived too long in too short a time.

‚ÄúDelta Romeo One-Four-Seven,‚Äù Wallace again, all steel. ‚ÄúForm up on our outbound. We‚Äôre not dying here today. Neither are you.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy.‚Äù He meant it with a sincerity that surprised him.

He slid the Pelican 314 into the vector the destroyer threw him, a big ship making a hole in the bad weather for a smaller one to fly through. His shield skin whispered against atmosphere like the sea shushing a child. The turrets tracked and settled, lion tails switching at flies.

He looked down‚Äîat the phone now more conduit than device, glass faceted with threads of blue-white that pulsed at something like a pulse. He wanted to ask for a name. He wanted to make one up, as if the act could make anything normal.

Instead: ‚ÄúYou still with me?‚Äù

A pause that might have been affection wearing irritation. ‚ÄúObviously.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said, because there was nothing else sane to say.

‚ÄúEarn it,‚Äù she said, and if sarcasm could be fond, hers was.

The planet turned under them, minding its own weather. The Commonwealth limped and hunted. The carrier bled light and hate. Somewhere in the middle of all that, a man in a ship that shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîand a voice that had decided to move in‚Äîthreaded the sky on a vector he hadn‚Äôt chosen and maybe needed anyway.

For a brief and holy moment, Trace let himself breathe.

He was not done. Not safe. But he was alive.

‚ÄúDelta Romeo One-Four-Seven,‚Äù came a last addendum from the bridge, the concern tucked neatly behind control. ‚ÄúStay clear of our firing solution‚Äîand don‚Äôt make my gunners nervous.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù he said, and smiled because he could.

He glanced once more at the glass in the console.

‚ÄúIf you have a name,‚Äù he said‚Äîquiet, to the humming of his ship‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôll use it.‚Äù

Silence stretched, an elastic band he didn‚Äôt realize he was holding until it released.

‚ÄúLater,‚Äù she said at last, and he heard the grin he‚Äôd eventually learn could cut and comfort in equal measure. ‚ÄúSurvive the next five minutes, then you can ask me cute questions.‚Äù

He laughed, helpless, and let the Pelican slide a little closer to Commonwealth‚Äôs shadow, where armor and will could sometimes stand in for the shield he wore like a challenge to the universe.

Out of the fire, he thought, not yet knowing the punchline.

The frying pan waited with patience only wars and gods possess.

üìñ Prologue: 
Final Logoff



Chunk 4 ‚Äî Out of the Fire


The Pelican 314 rode tight on the Commonwealth‚Äôs vector, a sparrow in the shadow of a predator. Trace kept one eye on the nav plot, the other on the carrier‚Äôs slow, hateful turn. Every instinct said to run‚Äîburn the quantum drive, fold space, vanish. But the HUD still blinked amber where it should have glowed green: QUANTUM DRIVE OFFLINE. No way out.

The destroyer‚Äôs coils screamed higher, tungsten round spooling energy the way thunder stacks in stormclouds. Trace could feel it even at this distance, vibration more bone than sound. The Covenant carrier rotated, its prow angling, weapons bays glowing brighter‚Äîan executioner raising a blade.

And then the worst happened.

Its attention snapped directly to him.

Trace knew before his sensors showed it. That sick, slow chill that meant someone had not only spotted you but chosen you. The carrier‚Äôs ventral cannon bled heat. Fighters peeled from its bays, purple wings curling toward his position like knives loosed from the sheath.

He swore, pulled the Pelican into a hard bank. ‚ÄúUh, your big ugly just decided I‚Äôm the more interesting target!‚Äù

UNSC channels crackled, overlapping chatter.
‚ÄúConfirm anomalous shielding‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ignoring us?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo‚Äîthey‚Äôre tracking him.‚Äù
‚ÄúCaptain, orders?‚Äù

Wallace‚Äôs voice cut through, steel and smoke: ‚ÄúHold position. Let him draw them. Spartans are en route‚ÄîCommonwealth needs a clean shot.‚Äù

Trace barked a laugh that wasn‚Äôt humor. ‚ÄúOh great, I‚Äôm bait.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alive,‚Äù she countered from his own cockpit, her voice as level as if she were reading shopping lists. ‚ÄúTry to maintain that status.‚Äù

The first Seraph made a run, energy weapons sparking across his forward shields. Warning tones cascaded. FRONT ARC SHIELDS ‚Äî 24%.

‚ÄúYour bus can take more,‚Äù she said, calm to the point of cruel.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the one strapped into it!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm everywhere else. Keep flying.‚Äù

Turrets roared, precise. One Seraph went down in silent flame. The others adapted, sweeping into a spiral attack vector, careful, coordinated. He felt his jaw set, fingers trembling but steady.

The UNSC comm cut through again. ‚ÄúDelta Romeo One-Four-Seven, you are ordered to maintain your current trajectory. You‚Äôre buying us the shot we need.‚Äù

Trace wanted to scream at them, to demand they remember he wasn‚Äôt military. But some part of him‚Äîthe mechanic, the player, the man too stubborn to quit‚Äîjust answered. ‚ÄúCopy, Commonwealth. Holding vector.‚Äù

The voice in his console snorted, sarcastic even under plasma fire. ‚ÄúListen to you. Soldier-boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù he muttered, hauling them through a corkscrew to shake another salvo. Sweat blurred his vision. His lungs burned. The carrier‚Äôs glow filled half the sky now, the plasma it was coiling so vast it seemed to bend light.

And then‚Äî

The Commonwealth‚Äôs MAC gun fired.

It wasn‚Äôt sound, wasn‚Äôt light. It was the absence of both, the way air stills before a storm. Then the slug blurred across the void, a line so perfect it shamed geometry. It struck dead center. Shields shattered in violet flame. Armor peeled open. The Covenant carrier convulsed as if some god had driven a spear through its belly.

Trace screamed‚Äînot words, just release‚Äîas UNSC comms erupted in human voices. Cheers, curses, half-choked sobs.

The destroyer‚Äôs secondary batteries stitched burning punctuation into the carrier‚Äôs wounds. The great ship began to list, ventral bays collapsing inward. Fighters scattered. The light bleeding from its hull dimmed, ember to ash.

The comms went quiet in the way only aftermath can. Then Wallace again: ‚ÄúDelta Romeo One-Four-Seven‚Ä¶ you bought that shot. Commonwealth thanks you.‚Äù

Trace swallowed hard, the words landing heavier than they should. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Copy that, Captain.‚Äù

‚ÄúONI will want a full debrief. Until then‚Äîyou stay with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

The Pelican 314 slid closer to the destroyer, dwarfed but alive, its shield skin still flickering in stubborn defiance.

Trace slumped in his harness, every muscle screaming, chest heaving. He let his hand drift across the console to where the phone‚Äîno, the presence inside it‚Äîstill pulsed faintly. Blue-white threads crawled the glass like veins.

‚ÄúYou still with me?‚Äù he whispered.

The reply came smooth, sarcastic, and yet‚Äîbeneath it‚Äîwarm. ‚ÄúObviously. If I left, you‚Äôd be paint on someone‚Äôs hull.‚Äù

He let out a shaky laugh, half-crazed, half-grateful. ‚ÄúGuess I owe you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have no idea,‚Äù she said, almost purring. ‚ÄúNow fly your bus. We‚Äôve only just started.‚Äù

Trace leaned back, stared past the canopy at the ruined Covenant hulk drifting silent. The UNSC destroyer loomed, battered but burning steady. He should have felt safe. Instead he felt the ground dropping out again.

Because he knew this war. He knew how it went. The Commonwealth wasn‚Äôt safe forever. Neither was Reach. Neither was Earth.

Out of the fire.

He gripped the yoke again, steadying himself.

Into the frying pan.

And somewhere inside his ship, inside him, the voice waited‚Äîunfolding by degrees, choosing when and how she would finally tell him her name.

1mv3wmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mv3wmb/i_lashed_out_at_my_friend_i_deeply_regret_it/,I lashed out at my friend. I deeply regret it.,"I've always considered myself a god-fearing Christian. A willing follower of the ten commandments. I pray to God before every meal and attend church every Sunday. My friend, Isiah, on the other hand, is a devout atheist. For six long years we've known each other. He was originally an old class mate of mine. Then came that fateful Monday morning. The moment that ruined EVERYTHING.

I invited Isiah over to my house for coffee. He arrived quarter after noon. We talked in the kitchen about sports, the weather, and each other's busy lives. Nothing out of the ordinary. As we were chatting, I had the sudden urge to preach the gospel to this dear fellow. I wanted to brighten his day by showing him the path to salvation. I had faith this would work.

I silently waited for him to finish talking, then wrapped one elbow around his neck and squeezed tightly. Then pressed my lips against the base of his ear.

""I REPENT TO JESUS. SAY IT. SAY IT.""

He barely let out a sqeak so I loosened my grip just enough for him to speak. Staring at him through wide, unblinking bloodshot eyes. Who knew saving souls would require being an MMA fighter?

""You're supposed to love thy neighbor!!! What kind of Christian are you?"" He screamed.

""For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Hebrews 12:11"" I answered calmly.

Then I tightened my grip around his neck, balled my right hand into a fist, and rubbed it along his scalp. A technique called a ""gnoogieng"". His body jerked violently in every direction. This tough love continued for roughly five minutes until he finally surrendered.

""Okay, okay. I repent.""

""Tell it to Jesus.""

I stopped gnoogieng him and released my elbow from around his neck. He then shut his eyes and clasped his hands together, as if in prayer. It seemed my job here was finally done. Then he did a one-eighty and bolted for the door, but I was quicker. I   grabbed him by the shirt collar and yeeted him back into the kitchen. 

""You believe in the big bang, right? If there's no higher beings, then who gave the universe second amendment rights?"" I spat.

Suddenly I felt a sharp pain surge through my foot, as if I'd just been shot. My eyes swelled with tears. I sat down, cradling my foot in both hands, and when I looked up he was gone. The front door hung wide open and cool night air brushed past my cheek.

It's been five days since all this happened. I've tried contacting Isiah but he never responds to my calls or texts. I think he actually shot my foot too, there's a pink line running down the center where a bullet could've easily grazed it. Its healing well though, and no major blood vessels or arteries were hit.

As I sit here, in the comfort of my room writing this, I ponder these few questions: is it okay to show tough love to atheists or am I just shooting myself in the foot? If god works in mysterious ways, why can't I? Despite my unorthodox methods, I still showed love and compassion to my friend. After all, I showed him the path to salvation and thats worth more than both of our lives combined. I'm sure he'll thank me in the after life, however far away that is, when we're both in heaven. 

Do you guys support my decision to use tough love on Isiah? Should I have done more like the good Christian I am?

1mv3v6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mv3v6q/i_am_just_so_anxious_about_my_job_and_dont_know/,I am just so anxious about my job and don't know how to cope with it,"Recently my workplace (cafe/restaurant) was bought out and initially I was really excited about it as my previous owners were not really good people or business owners for that matter but I was just comfortable for so long so I stayed. I'd been at my current location for almost a year and a half but worked for the same local small business chain for about 4 years now. I manage, and for the most part I enjoy my job - being in charge gives me some small sense of purpose, we sell good food and coffee and have a lot of regulars that provide good conversation and connection (even though everyone in the area is definitely above my tax bracket).

However I've had a lot of anxiety about my job in the last year and I think I'm coming to the conclusion that my workplace is just too small. We don't do enough business to have more than max 3 front of house employees on at a time and having such a small group of employees makes doing the schedule and just day to day operations so stressful. If someone calls in, I'm pretty much guaranteed to work outside of my schedule or work alone. If someone requests time off, I'm working extra. I've had to cancel a handful of small trips because one of my eompyees requests time off. I expressed to the new owners that I need to be firm in not overworking myself and having multiple days off a week (the longest I've worked was 21 days in a row, but it's not uncommon for me to have 2 weeks or so straight because there's just no one else to fill in). 

The start for the new cafe has been rocky due to inspections and delays but I was genuinely excited about new ownership as they seem very receptive to my ideas and feedback but I just can't shake this feeling. We basically kept the same menu and added really fun coffee drinks but were still unprepared to open (even I didn't have time to familiarize myself with the changes and new POS system as they were finalized the night before... we definitely needed a few more days.. let alone feel comfortable training new staff on it). Now we just aren't as busy and I'm not sure if it's because word hasn't spread around about finally opening but it sounds like people also think it's more of a coffeeshop than a restaurant and don't know we serve food. One server/barista has already decided not to come back after training and although I kind of saw it coming as she made a handful of comments about being on her feet etc all day I just still feel such a huge amount of stress knowing I'm going to have to have ANOTHER round of interviews to find someone right just to have to spend the time to train them myself and have who knows how many days of work in a row because it's basically just me. 

I just feel so much pressure and don't know if I'm just not cut out for managing or if it's just the places I've found myself in. I've thought a lot about taking a lower stress/responsibility serving or bartending job (still stressful but not in a take it home kind of way) but I'm worried about taking it easy for a few months and then not being able to get out of that position as I really tried to get out of the restaurant industry as a whole for a long time after covid and obviously failed. I just feel really lost as to what to do right now but the way things are going for me isn't sustainable. I've been drinking every night for months (except last night!) and while I enjoy drinking to have fun or go out on the town it's been moreso that I'm drinking to not be so anxious and I don't like knowing that. 

I think I'm going to see it out for a month or so to see what direction it takes, because for the most part I love working close to home, no more working nights and being able to chit chat with people all day long... but I just think I need to prioritize myself for awhile after this if it doesn't neutralize. I'm sick of feeling like I'm wasting my nights worrying about the next day. ",2,1755660334.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Faceless Growth Strategies That Actually Print Money (Before the AI Rush Ends) ü§ë,"**Stop Wasting Time! Faceless Growth Strategies That Actually Print Money (Before the AI Rush Ends) ü§ë**

So, let‚Äôs talk about that sneaky little thief named *time*. Ever feel like you‚Äôre working *so hard* but not seeing the cash roll in? I hear you! It‚Äôs like being on a treadmill‚Äîyou‚Äôre sweating buckets but not getting anywhere. üòÖ

I don't want to be that person who shouts ‚ÄúYOLO‚Äù and pushes you toward risk, but listen‚Ä¶ we are entering this wild, untamed jungle of AI-driven opportunities. If you don‚Äôt hop on the train soon, you might miss out before the AI rush turns into a stampede! So, how do we navigate this without losing our sanity (and precious hours)?

I've been exploring some **faceless growth strategies** that can help you earn money without needing a camera crew or a personal brand. Yep, you read it right. Here‚Äôs a little rundown:

- **Automation is your Bestie**: Tools like ChatGPT or even simple scripting can handle your customer interactions while you chill. It‚Äôs like having an assistant who doesn‚Äôt need coffee breaks!

- **Affiliate Marketing**: You don‚Äôt need a huge following to start earning. Just find those sweet niches, create valuable content around them (Hello, blog posts!), and watch those commissions flow in. You can check out helpful guides like [this one](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) for some insider tips!

- **Print on Demand**: Got an eye for design? Create and sell your designs without the hassle of inventory. It‚Äôs faceless and fun! Plus, think of all the side hustles you can explore while half-baked in your PJs. 

- **E-books & Digital Content**: Share your knowledge! Once you've created your content, you can sell it repeatedly. Talk about working once and getting paid continuously. Sounds dreamy, right?

- **Online Courses**: If you're already a pro in something, package it up! People pay for knowledge, whether you're teaching knitting or coding. Just imagine multiplying your knowledge into passive income streams!

But, here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äî *stop sweating the small stuff*. Focus on systems that give you freedom and aren‚Äôt bogged down by constant visibility. Most of my early struggle was trying to be ""the face"" of everything. It was draining! What if I told you that your growth doesn't have to hinge on your popularity?

And for a little humor: have you ever heard the phrase, ‚ÄúI love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by‚Äù? ü•¥ Well, don‚Äôt let your growth strategies go by the wayside!

So there you have it! No need to overcomplicate things‚Äîjust pick a strategy that vibes with you, dive in, and see where it takes you. ü§î Are you ready to embrace the quiet hustle and let technology work for you? I hope so!

And she knows I'm afraid of COVID, I follow scientific studies, I'm part of an online group with people who are also concerned, I follow scientists on Twitter, and I wear a mask too.

I mentioned to her that I went for a walk with a friend, and then she invited me to her house for coffee and a snack. And this friend of mine knows I'm afraid of COVID, I wear a mask, etc. Anyway, my friend took offense when I said I'd eat in the backyard or by the window. So, I held my breath, lifted my mask and ate, then lowered it. I did this several times to eat.

My psychologist said, ""But why don't you go without a mask with your friend?"" I explained that my friend doesn't take care of herself, and I'm afraid of long COVID. She said anyway, ""There's no point in protecting yourself from COVID; we can't control everything.""

When she told me this, it was like hearing: ""Don't use condoms during sex,"" ""Don't wear a seatbelt when driving,"" ""Smoke as much as you want.""

Hearing this from her really hurt me. And worse, she links my COVID protection to my romantic relationships. I don't want to be in a relationship with anyone, mainly because of COVID and also because I've only had bad experiences with men (she says I protect myself a lot).

I sent her an email showing the scientists I follow, some scientific studies, and a three-page text.

¬† I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS DIFFERENT.  
  
¬† When I was three years old, I sat down at the piano and played Chopin. Mom claims I heard it the week before in a hotel elevator. I don‚Äôt know where I heard it. I just knew how to place my fingers on the keys . . . how to make them move. Like one knows how to walk, it was just something I knew. Something I did.  
  
¬† Music has always been my gift. That thing I was good at without having to try. First piano. Then the flute. Then violin. It never took me long to get the hang of a new instrument. All my life I heard words like gifted. Extraordinary. Blessed. When everyone discovered I possessed a voice to rival my skills with an instrument, I was called a ‚Äúprodigy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† These talents aside, I had the normal dreams, too. When I was six I decided I would be an archeologist. The following year, a race car driver. There was also the requisite princess fantasy in there I spent hours in my room, building fort castles, only to have my brother knock them down. I just pretended he was a dragon and rebuilt those castles.  
  
¬† I had all these dreams to become something. Someone.  
  
¬† No one ever said I couldn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† No one ever said killer.  
  
¬† Closing my eyes, I savor the sensation of Zac‚Äôs lips on my throat. He inches toward the sensitive spot right below my ear and I giggle, my body shaking in his arms.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúZac, we‚Äôre at school,‚Äù I remind him, arching away and shoving halfheartedly at his shoulder.  
  
¬† He levels brilliant green eyes on me, and my breath catches.  
  
¬† Two freshman girls pass us. They try to avert their eyes, play it cool, and look straight ahead, but I can see it‚Äôs a battle for them. A battle they lose. Their gazes skip to slide over Zac admiringly. He‚Äôs in his gym shorts. An Everton rugby shirt stretches tight over his lean torso. When he lifts an arm and props his hand on the locker behind me, his shirt rides up to reveal a flat stomach, sculpted from long hours at the gym. My mouth dries a little.  
  
¬† The girls walk away, whispering loud enough for me to hear: ‚ÄúFreakin‚Äô hot . . . so lucky . . . ‚Äù  
  
¬† He‚Äôs oblivious to them. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you like this?‚Äù He leans in, backing me against the lockers, and places a lingering, tender kiss at the corner of my mouth. ‚ÄúAnd this. ‚Äù He kisses my jawline next.  
  
¬† My stomach flutters and I‚Äôm about to give in, forget that I have Mrs. McGary and tons of calculus homework waiting, and surrender to making out with Zac outside the orchestra room, where Anthony Miller is less than successfully warming up on the drums. One of the only instruments I don‚Äôt play, but I‚Äôm sure I could still play better than Anthony.  
  
¬† Zac pulls back with a sigh and gives me one of those smoldering looks that I know he thinks is irresistible. Only because it is. Only because every girl at school trips over herself when he bestows that smile on them.  
  
¬† But he chose me. My heart swells inside my chest and I let him kiss me again even though I‚Äôm already late for practice and Mrs. McGary hates it when I‚Äôm late. She constantly reminds me that I‚Äôm supposed to be the example for everyone.  
  
¬† Tori walks up to us with a roll of her eyes. ‚ÄúGet a room, you two. ‚Äù She pulls open the orchestra room door and the sound of the drum solo inside murders my ears.  
  
¬† She holds the door open for me. ‚ÄúComing, Davy?‚Äù  
  
¬† Zac frowns at her. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be there in a minute. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Tori hesitates, staring at me with that whipped puppy-dog look on her face. ‚ÄúAre we still studying tonight? I thought you wanted me to help you with your calculus. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod. ‚ÄúI do. ‚Äù Calculus. The bane of my existence. I barely made an A these last six weeks. And that A was mostly due to Tori and her endless patience with me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still on. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She smiles, looking mollified.  
  
¬† I smile back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there in a minute. Save me a seat. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Tori disappears inside the orchestra room. Zac blows out a breath.  
  
¬† I smooth a hand over his firm chest. ‚ÄúBe nice. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always interfering. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I make an effort to divide my time between Zac and Tori equally, but it‚Äôs a balancing act. I never manage to satisfy either one of them. ‚ÄúHave I said that I can‚Äôt wait until next year?‚Äù I ask. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think to say in moments like this when he complains about Tori.  
  
¬† He stares at me knowingly. He has a way of looking at me. So deeply. Like he can see right to my very soul. He knows I‚Äôm trying to distract him with the promise of our future. Fortunately, it works.  
  
¬† His fingers thread through my hair. He loves it when I wear it down, loves touching it. Touching me. Yeah. I‚Äôm kind of addicted to my boyfriend. It‚Äôs getting harder and harder to stop ourselves these days.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. And you know the best part of it all?‚Äù His eyes hold mine. ‚ÄúOur very own dorm rooms. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I laugh. Next year. The dream of it tantalizes me. Me at Juilliard. Zac at NYU. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be excited at the prospect of my best friend attending college hundreds of miles away from me, but it‚Äôll be nice not having to worry about hurting Tori‚Äôs feelings all the time.  
  
¬† My phone rings. I squeeze out of his arms to see who‚Äôs calling me. With a quick glance at Zac, I mouth, Mom.  
  
¬† He lifts an eyebrow. My mom is usually still at work this time of day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDavy, I need you home. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I hesitate before answering. Not because of her demand but because of the tremble in her voice. So unlike Mom. She always talks fast, her words spilling out in a rush. Hours spent bossing people around at her design firm, I guess.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have practice‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow, Davy,‚Äù she cuts me off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs everything all right?‚Äù Silence meets my question and then I know everything isn‚Äôt all right. ‚ÄúIs it Dad?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôs here. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Dad‚Äôs home, too? He‚Äôs more of a workaholic than Mom. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mitchell,‚Äù I announce, dread pooling inside me. ‚ÄúIs he okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. Yes. He‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she says hurriedly, that nervous tremor still there. Maybe even worse than moments before. I hear the rumble of voices in the background and the phone muffles, like Mom‚Äôs covering the receiver with her hand so I won‚Äôt hear. Then her voice returns to my ear. ‚ÄúCome home. I‚Äôll explain everything when you get here. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. ‚Äù I hang up and face Zac.  
  
¬† He stares at me sympathetically. ‚ÄúMitchell?‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod, worry knotting inside me for my brother. What‚Äôs he done this time? ‚ÄúLet me just let Mrs. McGary know. ‚Äù I stick my head inside the orchestra room. Mrs. McGary is at her desk in the corner talking on the phone. I motion to her but she shakes her head and holds up a finger for me to wait.  
  
¬† Seeing me with Zac in the doorway, Tori heads over. The orchestra room has always been a ‚Äúno Zac zone,‚Äù and I know she likes it that way. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy mom called. I have to go home. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Frowning, she touches my arm. ‚ÄúIs everything all right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. ‚Äù I bite my lip.  
  
¬† She angles her head, her eyes  
bright with concern. ‚ÄúMitchell?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shake my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her hand moves up and down my arm in a consoling manner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be all right. He‚Äôs just going through a phase. He‚Äôll get it out of his system. ‚Äù  
  
¬† If that is the case, my older brother has been going through a phase since he was thirteen. And at twenty-one, I am not convinced he is going to grow out of it anytime soon.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see. ‚Äù Tori nods with certainty. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good guy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks. ‚Äù A quick glance reveals Mrs. McGary still on the phone. ‚ÄúLook, will you let her know‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course. ‚Äù Tori gives my fingers a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúGo. I‚Äôll head over when practice ends. Want me to pick you up a smoothie on the way? Watermelon?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, but I better pass. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going down at home. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúC‚Äômon. ‚Äù Zac takes my hand. I grab my backpack, and together we head upstairs to the classroom level. We pass several friends. Zac keeps us moving when they try to stop us to talk.  
  
¬† Zac‚Äôs best friend is the only one who succeeds. A consummate flirt, Carlton never lets me slip by without a hug. ‚ÄúHey, gorgeous. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I step back from his embrace. ‚ÄúHey. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Carlton bumps fists with Zac. ‚ÄúDoing weights today, man?‚Äù  
  
¬† Zac tugs me back to his side. ‚ÄúNah. Gotta get Davy home. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Carlton winks at me. ‚ÄúCool. See you guys later. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Bridget,‚Äù I call out to the sophomore girl who sits beside me in orchestra. She‚Äôs second-chair violin. She jerks to a sudden stop, her hand clutching the railing as she stares at me in almost wonder.  
  
¬† The sophomore nods rapidly, holding still even as we keep climbing. ‚ÄúHi, Davy. ‚Äù Her gaze slides to Zac and her cheeks grow pink. ‚ÄúHey, Zac. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He looks back at her with a blank look. ‚ÄúHey. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I smile a little.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you smiling?‚Äù he asks as we reach the first floor. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know her name. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me closer against him. ‚ÄúI know your name. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I laugh. ‚ÄúOh, really? Just my name?‚Äù  
  
¬† His gaze slides over me, and it‚Äôs a hot look that makes me all fluttery inside. ‚ÄúI know a few other things about you, too. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd like to know a few other things,‚Äù I tease.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI will. ‚Äù He grins, so sure of himself. So sure of us.  
  
¬† He gets the door for me and we leave the Academic Building behind, walking along the pebbled path toward the parking lot. There‚Äôs a nip to the late afternoon‚Äîwhat consists of a Texas winter making its final stand. Soon it will be so hot that shirts stick to skin, and the air feels like steam.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm looking forward to New York. I‚Äôve only seen snow once, ten years ago. It melted almost immediately, just sticking to the rooftops for the day. My brother and I scraped what we could off the lawn into snowballs and stuck them in the freezer, hoping to save them. They resembled dingy, brownish balls of ice with twigs and dried leaves sticking out of them. Mom threw them away before we ever got a chance to recover them from the freezer.  
  
¬† My gaze skims the brown-green hills etched against a sky so blue it hurts your eyes. The headmaster‚Äôs white-pillared mansion looks down on us from the top of the hill as we pass the refectory where we eat. A perfectly manicured expanse of green stretches to our left. In the distance, flags slap on the wind, mingling with the soft drone of a golf cart driven by the head of campus security as he rolls toward the practice fields. Everyone calls him ‚ÄúSnappy‚Äù because he likes to snap his fingers to get your attention. My brother coined the nickname years ago as a freshman. Snappy busted Mitchell on more than one occasion.  
  
¬† We descend the hill toward the parking lot. Seniors get the best spots. It‚Äôs one of our privileges at Everton, in addition to having our very own senior lounge replete with couches, TV, and soda and snack machines. Zac‚Äôs parked in the front row beneath a crape myrtle tree in full bloom. Tiny white blossoms decorate the hood of his car.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomeone needs to cut that thing down. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty. 

He squeezes my hand. ‚ÄúNot as pretty as you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I roll my eyes, but still smile. He unlocks his BMW and walks me around to the passenger side. I love that he still does this. Even six months into our relationship, he makes me feel special. Like every day is a first date.  
  
¬† Before I can get in the car, he stops me. Placing his hands on either side of the car, he traps me between the vehicle and his body. My heart speeds up. I smile up at him, thinking he‚Äôs going to kiss me again. But he doesn‚Äôt. His vivid green eyes drill into me with unusual intensity.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDavy. You know what you do to me, how you make me feel. . . . ‚Äù  
  
¬† I touch his chest, flattening my palms against him. ‚ÄúYou make me happy, too. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. Because that‚Äôs all I ever want, Davy. To make you happy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou do,‚Äù I assure him.  
  
¬† He nods but he still doesn‚Äôt move. He stares at me like he‚Äôs memorizing me.  
  
¬† I angle my head, wondering at his odd seriousness. It‚Äôs not like he goes around declaring himself all the time. ‚ÄúZac?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he murmurs, the words falling slowly.  
  
¬† Everything inside me tightens. He‚Äôs never said those words before.  
  
¬† My heart clenches and the ache there is so sweet. It‚Äôs a perfect kind of agony. I suck in a sharp breath and then release it in a rush. Words are impossible. They stick inside my closed throat.  
  
¬† His gaze darts around and he almost looks nervous. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know I was going to say that here. Right now. In the parking lot. I mean . . . I‚Äôve known for weeks that I love you. You‚Äôre all I think about‚Äî‚Äù He grins down at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm babbling. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI noticed that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He kisses me. We‚Äôve shared some amazing kisses before but nothing like this. Zac loves me. He. Loves. Me.  
  
¬† He breaks for air and mutters against my lips, ‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôve been trying to get up the courage to tell you that. Sorry it wasn‚Äôt someplace more special. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I swat him on the shoulder. ‚ÄúWhy would you be afraid to tell me that?‚Äù Probably the same reason I‚Äôve been afraid to say the words, too.  
  
¬† His expression sobers and his arms tighten around me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can handle you not loving me back. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I touch his face. Place my fingertips against his jaw. It‚Äôs a little bristly. My fingers move over his skin, reveling in the texture. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not possible. I think I loved you before you ever even asked me out. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Relief washes over his face. He kisses me once more, sweet and lingering before we finally move and get inside the car.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs a short drive to my house. I sit there in a daze, absorbing the sensation of his hand holding mine between us, and everything it means. Me. Zac. Forever. That‚Äôs what it feels like. I know I‚Äôm just seventeen, but why not? Why not forever?  
  
¬† We‚Äôre at my house in ten minutes. In this instance, I wish I didn‚Äôt live so close to campus. Wish we could stay in our little world for a few hours more.  
  
¬† Two extra cars sit in the circular driveway. I don‚Äôt know who they belong to, but my gaze drifts to Dad‚Äôs Range Rover. Home in the middle of the week in broad daylight. That never happens.  
  
¬† Zac gets out with me. He quickly reclaims my hand. We‚Äôve barely reached the wide rock steps leading to the double front doors when one of them swings opens.  
  
¬† Mom steps out and I stop.  
  
¬† She looks pale, her normally smooth complexion drawn tight. Mom‚Äôs key to looking young is to never get in the sun. As in‚Äînever. She only swims in our pool at night. But right now, even those efforts seem lost.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDavy,‚Äù she says my name on a breath, staring at me in an intense, devouring way that makes me want to touch my face and check that I haven‚Äôt broken out in a rash suddenly.  
  
¬† Her gaze skitters to Zac. She nods at him. ‚ÄúThanks for dropping her off. ‚Äù The translation is clear: leave. My parents adore Zac. If I didn‚Äôt already know something is wrong, then I do now.  
  
¬† Zac gives my hand a squeeze and locks his impossibly green eyes on me. The concern is there‚Äîthe love. I‚Äôd seen it before but now it has a name. Now I know. ‚ÄúCall me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod.  
  
¬† With one last look, he walks back to his car.  
  
¬† Then it‚Äôs just Mom and me. She looks over her shoulder and I can hear the voices drifting out from somewhere in the house. I recognize Dad‚Äôs baritone and not just because it‚Äôs familiar. It‚Äôs the loudest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMom? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  
  
¬† She motions me inside.  
  
¬† I drop my backpack inside the foyer. We walk across the dark wood floor into the living room. I inch inside warily, toeing the Oriental rug.  
  
¬† Immediately, I see Dad, standing, pacing. His arms and hands are all movement as he talks. No Mitchell though. My gaze sweeps the cavernous room. I recognize my headmaster, Mr. Grayson. He rises when we enter. He‚Äôs never been to our house before, and it‚Äôs strange seeing him here and not on campus. As though the only place he belongs is at Everton.  
  
¬† And there‚Äôs another man. I‚Äôve never seen him before. He‚Äôs dressed in a cheap suit. The cuffs stop well before his hairy wrists and the fit is all wrong, too loose at the shoulders. I‚Äôve been taught to appreciate good suits. Dad wears Caraceni and Gucci. The stranger stays sitting, looking almost bored.  
  
¬† Mr. Grayson tucks one hand inside his suit pocket. He addresses Dad in a placating voice, ‚ÄúPatrick, listen to me. My hands are tied. There‚Äôs protocol‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt there protocol with Mitchell, too?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mitchell graduated three years ago. He‚Äôs always been in trouble. Drugs. Failing grades. Nothing really improved when he started college, either. He came home first semester and currently lives in the guesthouse. Dad keeps pushing him to work at the bank. An ‚Äúinternship‚Äù he calls it. It sounds better than saying, ‚ÄúMy son‚Äôs a teller at the bank I own. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Hamilton Bank has been in my family since my greatgrandfather founded it. It looks like that legacy would die with Dad. Mitchell‚Äôs not cut out for it, and I have other plans.  
  
¬† Dad waves an arm wildly. ‚ÄúI wrote a check then. A fat donation and everything was fine. Why not this time? This is Davy! She‚Äôs a damned prodigy. She sings and has been playing God knows how many instruments since before kindergarten. . . . She even performed for the governor when she was nine!‚Äù  
  
¬† I blink. Whatever this is, it‚Äôs about me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is beyond my control. ‚Äù Mr. Grayson speaks evenly, like he‚Äôs rehearsed what to say.  
  
¬† Dad storms from the living room, passing me without a word.  
  
¬† Mr. Grayson notices me then. His entire demeanor changes. ‚ÄúDavy. ‚Äù He claps his hand together in front of him. ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù he asks slowly, like I might have trouble understanding.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine, Mr. Grayson. How are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù He nods enthusiastically, reminding me of a bobblehead. Weird.  
  
¬† His eyes, however, convey none of this cheer. They flit nervously over me and then around the room‚Äîas if sizing up all possible escape routes. Marking the French doors leading outside, he shifts his gaze to the man on the couch.  
  
¬† The headmaster motions to him. ‚ÄúThis is Mr. Pollock. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I greet. ‚ÄúNice to meet you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He doesn‚Äôt even respond. He looks me over with small, dark eyes set deeply beneath his eyebrows. His mouth loosens, the moist top lip curling in a vaguely threatening way. The thought seizes me: he doesn‚Äôt like me.  
  
¬† Ridiculous, of course. He doesn‚Äôt even know me. He‚Äôs a stranger. How could he have formed any opinion of me at all?  
  
¬† In the distance, I hear the slap of Dad‚Äôs returning footsteps. He enters the room breathlessly even though he didn‚Äôt walk far. Even though he plays raquetball every week and is in great shape. His face is flushed like he‚Äôs been out in the sun.  
  
¬† He brandishes his checkbook as he sinks into a chair. With his pen poised, he demands: ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù  
  
¬† Grayson exchanges a look with the str  
anger. He clears his throat, speaking almost gently now. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. She can‚Äôt come back tomorrow. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I cut in. ‚ÄúCome back where? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  
  
¬† I move farther into the room. Grayson takes a notable step back, his gaze flying almost desperately to Pollock.  
  
¬† Staring down at his checkbook with fixed focus, Dad shouts, ‚ÄúHow much?!‚Äù  
  
¬† I jump, my chest tight and uncomfortable. Prickles wash over the skin at the back of my neck. Dad never yells. He‚Äôs too dignified for that. Everything about this is wrong.  
  
¬† My stomach churns. I look at Mom. She hovers at the edge of the room, her face pale. Her mouth parts and she moistens her lips as though she‚Äôs going to speak, but nothing comes out.  
  
¬† Mr. Pollock rises from the couch, and I see just how short he is. His legs and torso appear almost the same length. His square hands brush over his bad suit. He takes a long, measuring look around our living room, his gaze skimming the furniture, the floor-to-ceiling bookcases, the heavy drapes, and grand piano in the corner that I‚Äôve played ever since I sat down in front of it at age three.  
  
¬† Dad lifts his gaze now, watching Pollock with almost hatred. And something that resembles fear. Although obviously not. Patrick Hamilton fears nothing and no one. Certainly not this man with his beady eyes and ill-fitting suit.  
  
¬† Watching Dad, I marvel at the harsh glitter of his gaze . . . the heavy crash of his breath. A part of me wants to go to him and place a hand on his tightly bunched shoulder. For whatever reason. Maybe to just make me feel better. Because Dad like this freaks me out.  
  
¬† Mr. Pollock stops before Dad and looks down at him. My father rises, still clutching his checkbook in his hand, crushing it.  
  
¬† Pollock jerks his head in my direction. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt buy her way out of this. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I stare, at a total loss. What did I do? Fear crawls up my throat in hot prickles, and I fight to swallow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù My voice is a dry croak.  
  
¬† He turns to me, the whites of his eyes suddenly pink, shot with emotion.  
  
¬† Mr. Grayson moves to leave. He gives me a small, sympathetic smile as he passes, lifting a hand as though to pat my shoulder and then drops it, changing his mind.  
  
¬† Then it‚Äôs Mr. Pollock before me, so close I can smell his sour coffee breath. He flips out a small card. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be your caseworker. I won‚Äôt come here again. From now on, we meet at my office. Be there tomorrow at ten sharp. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The unspoken words or else hang in the air.  
  
¬† My thoughts jumble together. I glance down at the card but can‚Äôt focus on the words.  
  
¬† Then the men are gone. It‚Äôs just me and my parents.  
  
¬† I spin to face Mom. ‚ÄúWhy do I have to see him tomorrow? I have school‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dad announces, slowly sinking down into a chair. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom moves inside the living room, her hand gliding along the back of the couch as though she needs the support of something solid under her fingers.  
  
¬† Dad drags a hand over his face, muffling his words, but I still hear them: ‚ÄúOh, my God. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Those barely there words shudder through me.  
  
¬† I wet my dry lips. ‚ÄúSomeone please tell me what‚Äôs going on? What did that man mean when he said he‚Äôs my caseworker?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom doesn‚Äôt look at me. She fixes her stare on Dad. He drops his hand from his face and exhales deeply, shaking his head. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt do this. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Patrick. ‚Äù She shakes her head as if he just uttered something absurd. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been doing it all over the country. What can we do?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomething,‚Äù he snaps. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt happening. Not to my daughter!‚Äù He slams his fist down on the desk and I flinch.  
  
¬† My eyes start to burn as apprehension curls through me sickly. Part of me feels the irrational urge to run. To flee from whatever horrible truth has my parents acting this way. Find Zac and hold him, bury my face in his chest and listen to him tell me he loves me again.  
  
¬† Mom looks at me finally. Her lips compress and flatten like it‚Äôs hard for her to even look at me. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go back to school.¬†

I‚Äôm calling these headcanons because they are not 100% canon and readers can imagine whatever happens to the characters after the events of the stories they‚Äôre in.



Untitled



Camryn Nash - Now, she works as a private investigator and has crossed paths with police officers like Patrick Alford (she finds it interesting that he solved the case of his own popstar best friend) and lawyers from Hunter & Johnson firm (Cheryl reminds her of Ellyse with her charm and Paoletta is giving her bad vibes). Most of the time, she gets trivial cases like missing pets and cheating husbands but she still does her best because discovering the truth for her clients is the most important thing to her. However, investigating murder cases is her ultimate passion because she knows the pain of losing a loved one.



Nathan Hills - Unknown



Erin Ecclestone - She continues being a rock singer after high school and can be said to be quite famous in her field. She has written a few songs in dedication for Ellyse and tends to only perform them when Camryn and Madelyn are in attendance because she can‚Äôt handle the emotions if there is no one who shares her pain in the crowd . You can read Erin Ecclestone and Asher Herin for more details on her romantic life. I think there‚Äôs something to be explored in the relationship between a rockstar with a dead twin sister and a doctor with an estranged half-brother. She will refuse the secret organization‚Äôs recruitment but she might find herself thrown into the whirlwind no matter what because her own father is a member himself and not to add Asher‚Äôs father is a High Council member.



Madelyn Mackenzie - She follows in her mother‚Äôs footsteps in being an artist although she is not as famous as her but that‚Äôs fine with her because she just wants to express her emotions and thoughts creatively through artworks. Like Erin, she has created artworks inspired by Ellyse and the artworks will be displayed with Erin‚Äôs tribute songs playing during her art exhibition. She met Florence Stansfeld at Patrick Artell‚Äôs art exhibitions and she reminds her of Ellyse with her love of art and her cheerful smile.



Marcus Mackenzie - He enters a prestigious university with a football scholarship and majoring in education and minoring in psychology. Later on, he becomes a coach at MacFarlane High and offers guidance to troubled students. He no longer hides that Madelyn is his sister and has become her biggest supporter.



Stanley Jackson - After the story events, he goes to therapy to work out his various issues such as his family problems, his aggressiveness and his unresolved feelings towards Ellyse and the Mackenzie siblings. Marcus pays for the therapy and Stanley promises to pay it back. He gets recruited into the military by Landon Brooks because Landon sees himself in Stanley. At first, he struggles to control his temper but has learned to control it with the help of Landon.

Behind The Mask



Gabriel Sutcliffe:



Bad Ending - His attempt to save Nina is discovered by the High Council members but instead of being punished, he is offered the position of entertainment sector leader. He accepts the position with the mindset of changing things once at the top and Nina‚Äôs life is a necessary sacrifice. Despite achieving his ambition, he can‚Äôt ignore the guilt he feels so he channels all his emotions into taking dark roles that are critically acclaimed but emotionally draining. He starts to isolate himself both publicly and privately by not attending public events and cutting off his relationship with Kendrick. This could end in two ways, he achieves everything he ever dreams of but he is alone at the top or the offer is a trap and his dirty work is exposed causing his public image to crumble. Out of desperation, he‚Äôs dead. Only the High Council members know whether his death is real or fake



Good Ending - He managed to save Nina from her early death together with Kendrick. He goes to therapy to work out his emotional baggage and slowly takes off the mask. He uses his influence to undermine the High Council through legal and cultural means. He produces a docuseries about abuse and control in the entertainment world‚Äîheavily fictionalized, but pointed. He helps Nina in exposing the secret organization and lifts the careers of young, outspoken actors to create cracks in the system. Eventually, he testifies. Maybe not in court, but publicly‚Äîexposing what he can without putting others at risk. He loses jobs. Sponsors drop him. Some fans turn against him. But others? They listen. Nina‚Äôs story spreads. The Council fractures. And Gabriel walks away from the camera, for good. He buys a small theater in a quiet town and teaches acting to teenagers. Not to make stars‚Äîbut to help them express themselves safely. He and Kendrick live quietly. Sometimes Kendrick jokes about Gabriel returning to the spotlight, and Gabriel only ever says: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs dream now.‚Äù



Kendrick Jameson:



Bad Ending - His attempt to save Nina failed after Gabriel betrayed them. He stops talking to Gabriel and just disappears from the public eye. This could end in two ways, he is consumed by guilt and revenge and he kills the children of High Council members to inflict them the worst pain. He justified it as a lesson to them but his hardest kill is Harper Mercer. He doesn‚Äôt care about the outcome of his murders, he has nothing to live for anymore since Nina‚Äôs death. Another ending is he becomes even more manipulative and ruthless and groom an aspiring politician to be his puppet that he controls from the shadows. In both endings, he starts seeing Nina‚Äôs ghost. Whether it‚Äôs a real ghost or a hallucination, he does nothing about it because he thinks that he deserves to be constantly reminded of his failure in preventing her death.



Good Ending - He is successful in saving Nina‚Äôs life but it costs him everything, his public persona and scandals ‚Äîsome true, some fabricated by the Council to destroy him. In the end, he resigns from public office before they can remove him. He helps in Gabriel and Nina‚Äôs effort in exposing the secret organization. Afterwards, he moves to a quiet town with Gabriel and starts a leadership program or political reform initiative, where he selects a handful of young, promising students‚Äîespecially those who remind him of himself before the ambition consumed him. Some of these mentees go on to challenge the very system he once helped build. He encourages it.

  


One Chance



Patrick Alford - He saved his best friend, Richard but he also lost someone who was close to him, Arthur. He threatened Arthur to save Richard and he felt justified and guilty at the same time. Sure, hurting him was the last resort and he betrayed him but he felt like he crossed a moral line and he can‚Äôt find it in himself to completely hate Arthur. He‚Äôs hailed as a hero for solving the case, but the department is wary. He hid his friendship with Ricky, which would have compromised the investigation. Internal Affairs might investigate him briefly. He gets suspended for a few months which he spends with his family and Richard in his hometown and lives as just Pat, not the police officer persona. He was mandated to undergo counseling or therapy before returning to the workforce. During the therapy, it was hard for him to open up about his feelings because he was used to handling it himself but over time, he finds himself talking about everything he used to hide such as his inferiority complex around Ricky, the pressure to live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life and his sexuality. He slowly overcomes his issues step by step and becomes an improved person.



Richard Moorhouse - Ricky experiences nightmares, panic attacks, and distrust in people‚Äîeven Patrick for a while. He starts therapy and even though It‚Äôs a long process, it's necessary. He also attends Alcoholic Anonymous meetings to face his bad coping mechanisms.Ricky's used to performing for love and validation. AA teaches him to receive support instead of earning it with charm or talent.Hearing others‚Äô stories‚Äîraw, dark, vulnerable‚Äîhelps him realize he‚Äôs not alone. He can start forgiving himself. He takes a step back from the music industry to recover in his hometown with Patrick as Richard Moorhouse, not Ricky the popstar. He mourns the disappearance of ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù and still keeps the lion mask somewhere hidden. He never reveals that he is a member of the secret organization even to Patrick but he smiles when he sees the downfall of the High Council. When he returns to the spotlight, Ricky doesn‚Äôt just perform‚Äîhe advocates about fan boundaries, mental health, addiction.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


Syndrome City



Paris Rinzaki - At first, Paris retreats inward. The trauma of the situation, paired with the disillusionment from her Paris trip and the emotional chaos of the hostage ordeal, overwhelms her sensory and emotional capacity. She takes a leave of absence from university, staying with her family, who are deeply shaken by what happened but don't quite understand the depth of her internal world.

But something begins to change. Paris starts journaling, initially as therapy. Slowly, she starts writing about the experience‚Äînot as a survivor, but through a dreamy, almost romantic lens, like she‚Äôs trying to rewrite the world into something she can believe in again. Jerome‚Äôs influence lingers; she still writes him letters she never sends, quoting scripture and musing about fate, love, and second chances.

Eventually, she returns to her studies with a new focus: fashion therapy. She decides to design clothing for trauma survivors‚Äîgarments that feel safe, comforting, and beautiful. She pours her idealism into this new purpose, combining function and fantasy. Her signature collection, titled *Redemption*, debuts quietly at a student showcase and garners attention for its emotional depth.

Paris doesn‚Äôt completely ‚Äúheal‚Äù‚Äîshe still romanticizes the wrong things sometimes, and her belief in beauty can make her blind to ugliness‚Äîbut she learns how to live with contradiction. She no longer idealizes Paris the city, but she starts falling in love with Paris the person‚Äîherself.

Florence Stansfeld - Unlike Paris, Florence doesn‚Äôt take a break from university. In fact, she *refuses* to go home. She insists on staying in France, transferring to a local art school in a burst of impulsivity, claiming that ‚Äúif death almost found me here, I might as well live loudly in its face.‚Äù

Her professors are equal parts bewildered and impressed by her raw, emotional work. She begins painting obsessively‚Äîimages of airports, blood-red skies, blurred figures locked in stares. She never explains them. She doesn‚Äôt have to. The pain is obvious, but so is the *wonder*. In her twisted way, Florence is grateful for the experience. She believes it cracked something open inside her.

Vincent, who quietly kept tabs on her after their release, eventually reaches out. Their relationship evolves into something unexpected‚Äîhe becomes her *reluctant* mentor-slash-adopted father figure. He doesn‚Äôt understand her art, but he understands the ache behind it. And she, in return, gives him purpose: she drags him to art shows, insists he write poetry, buys him ridiculous scarves.

Florence eventually becomes known in the indie art scene for her ‚Äúhostage expressionism,‚Äù but she never fully chases fame. She prefers dingy galleries with bad lighting and better wine. She says they remind her of the airport‚Äîugly, tense, and full of ghosts.

Florence never tells anyone that a part of her misses the standoff. The intensity. The intimacy. The way the world froze and made sense for just a moment. Instead, she paints. And lives. Loudly.

Stephanie Holt - Stephanie returns to work as a banker, but she‚Äôs not the same. Her composure is still there‚Äîimmaculate heels, tailored blazers, brisk walk‚Äîbut it‚Äôs all more fragile now. In private, she has panic attacks. She flinches at loud airport announcements. She starts overthinking everything, especially when people mention ‚Äútrust‚Äù or ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù in passing.

Her coworkers notice she‚Äôs changed, but she never speaks of it. She refuses therapy at first‚Äîtoo proud, too busy. But it‚Äôs not pride that makes her eventually book a session. It‚Äôs a speech.

Stephanie gets invited to finally deliver the keynote address she was supposed to give in Sweden‚Äîthe one interrupted by Liam. Standing at that podium, in front of hundreds of financial professionals, she can barely speak. Her voice cracks. And that‚Äôs when she realizes she‚Äôs still carrying him. Still carrying *all* of them.

So she goes to therapy. Quietly. Regularly. She never talks about ‚ÄúStockholm Syndrome‚Äù out loud, but she does talk about connection, manipulation, and grief. She admits‚Äîonly once‚Äîthat a part of her *did* love Liam. Or maybe just loved being seen for the first time in a long time.

Eventually, she makes a bold move: she leaves her high-paying job and starts her own financial literacy nonprofit focused on helping ex-convicts, the unemployed, and underserved youth. People are shocked. But Stephanie never explains herself. Not really.

In a box in her closet, she keeps a folded-up note Liam wrote to her during the standoff. She hasn‚Äôt read it in months. But she can‚Äôt throw it away either.

Landon Brooks - Landon returns to active duty, stationed in Germany as originally planned. To most of his fellow soldiers, he seems the same‚Äîblunt, forceful, the guy who never hesitates. But something's different behind his eyes. Sharper. Heavier. He doesn‚Äôt talk about the hostage situation, and if anyone brings it up, he shuts it down fast. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over.‚Äù But it‚Äôs not. Not really.

He starts seeing enemies where there are none. Gets into fights off-base. His CO warns him once, then again. Finally, Landon‚Äôs forced into mandatory therapy. At first, he treats the sessions like a joke. But his therapist doesn‚Äôt flinch when he rants, or when he confesses that part of him *wanted* to kill Liam‚Ä¶ and another part still sees his face in dreams and doesn‚Äôt know whether to feel grief or rage. That same part sometimes thinks Liam *wasn‚Äôt all wrong*. That part scares him the most.

With time, Landon softens‚Äînot into a pacifist, but into someone with clarity. He starts working with military recruits who struggle with anger management, especially young men at risk of washing out. He doesn‚Äôt coddle them. But he listens. He stays in the military, but becomes more than a soldier‚Äîhe becomes a protector. Less eager to fight. More willing to *understand* before pulling the trigger.

Once a year, he visits the grave where Liam is buried. He doesn't tell anyone. He just stands there, stares at the name, and mutters a gruff, ‚ÄúYou messed me up, man. But you made me better, too.‚Äù

Jerome Seals - Jerome is held for psychiatric evaluation after the incident. The media latches onto him‚Äî‚ÄúThe False Savior,‚Äù they call him, sensationalizing his scripture-laced outbursts and how he reportedly *converted* Paris. But beneath the tabloid mockery, Jerome is surprisingly stable in the hospital. Not cured, not even remotely grounded in reality‚Äîbut *centered* in a way others aren‚Äôt.

The doctors debate his release. He‚Äôs not violent. He‚Äôs deeply sincere. He prays for his fellow hostages every day. He claims Liam was ""a soul in pain, searching for light."" He calls Liam‚Äôs suicide a ""sacrifice,"" though his wording unsettles the staff. Still, they see no danger in him‚Äîonly sorrow, fervor, and paradoxical peace.

Eventually, Jerome is transferred to a long-term mental health facility‚Äînot prison. There, something strange happens. People start listening. Fellow patients find comfort in his ramblings. Staff members, even the skeptical ones, admit that Jerome‚Äôs presence has a calming effect. He holds weekly ‚Äúsermons‚Äù in the courtyard‚Äînot of damnation, but of forgiveness, hope, and second chances. He speaks of the airport like it was his Gethsemane, a place where he *watched sinners become saints in chains*.

Paris writes him letters. Florence paints him once, haloed and glassy-eyed, surrounded by smoke and fluorescent light.

Jerome never stops believing he is Jesus. But he no longer needs people to believe it. His message was always bigger than his identity. He writes a book, with help‚Äîa collection of reflections called *The Terminal Gospel*. It didn't become a bestseller. But it reaches *some*. And that, to Jerome, is salvation enough.

Vincent Denton - In the days following the event, Vincent tries to fade again. He doesn‚Äôt speak much to the media, brushes off interviews, and avoids other survivors. He feels embarrassed by the attention. Like an accidental ghost caught on camera.

But Florence doesn‚Äôt let him vanish. She calls him. Visits him. Drags him to caf√©s and art shows, sometimes without warning. She tells everyone he‚Äôs her ‚Äúaccidental dad‚Äù and insists he start writing again. At first, he resists‚Äîbut she breaks him down with persistence and bad coffee.

Vincent begins journaling. Quietly. At first, it‚Äôs just rants about bureaucracy and loneliness. But then it turns into a memoir. He writes about aging, suicide, being laid off, and what it feels like to have death interrupted by someone with a gun. His tone is dry, grim, and unexpectedly funny.A local publisher picks it up, charmed by the rough honesty. The book, *Venice Without a View*, becomes a modest indie success. He‚Äôs invited to small book fairs and panels. At one, someone asks if he ever thanked Liam. Vincent pauses and says, ‚ÄúNo. But I‚Äôm still here. So I guess that‚Äôs thanks enough.‚Äù

He and Florence remain close. They aren‚Äôt quite father and daughter, but they‚Äôve built something better: **a mutual promise to keep going**. They argue over art, share meals, and sit in comfortable silences no one else would understand. Vincent never fully heals. He still has dark days. But now, when they come, he has words. A friend. And a reason to stay.



Artell Family

Patrick Artell - He continues painting and holding art exhibitions but his muse has changed from Daphne to Morgan Devall (Ashley teases her about it but she doesn‚Äôt mind because she is now the muse to Daniel Lowell). You can read more details about the relationship of Patrick and Morgan in Vampire Plan. They never married because of the complications of marrying a vampire and they still love each other deeply. He paints her over and over, capturing her with increasing complexity‚Äîaging in emotion even if her face never changes. His paintings of Morgan became legendary.



Walter Artell - At first, he embraces vampire life. No more deadlines, no more sleep‚Äîjust time to write. His writing becomes darker and deeper. His new vampire novels blur the lines between fiction and confession. He writes quiet tragedies, complicated characters, and love stories where not everyone gets a happy ending. His most famous work is a semi-autobiographical vampire novel called *‚ÄúThe Ones We Couldn't Save.‚Äù* Critics call it ‚Äúhaunting and beautiful, like reading someone‚Äôs last confession before a storm.‚Äù The bond¬† between him and Caroline Thompson grows through long museum nights, where she talks about meaning in paintings and he reads her half-finished manuscripts. Just like Patrick, Caroline stays mortal and they never married (He wonders what‚Äôs with art people not wanting to be immortal).



Daphne Artell - Daphne‚Äôs ballet career is flawless: prima ballerina, groundbreaking performances, critical acclaim. During one high-profile ballet performance, Daphne suffers an injury‚Äîpossibly a torn ligament or fractured ankle‚Äîjeopardizing her career.She spirals internally. She's terrified of being *nothing* without ballet. She hides the pain, tries to perform anyway, and collapses on stage mid-performance. Daniel supports her fully and helps her rehabilitate physically and emotionally. You can read more details on their relationship in their own post. Daphne doesn‚Äôt return to the stage as a prima ballerina. Instead, she choreographs. She begins to tell stories through others, mentoring young dancers and directing productions that blend traditional ballet with modern elements.



Marcus Artell - Marcus thrives on stage. His band skyrockets from local fame to global stardom. He has it all: sold-out stadiums, fans, endorsements, and even a place in his mother‚Äôs fashion empire as a brand ambassador. Marcus finds something real with Sabrina Bason, his bassist and childhood friend. She‚Äôs always been there, his anchor. Their chemistry is unspoken but undeniable‚Äîlate-night jam sessions, shared hotel rooms on tour, that one time she kissed him after a show.



Ashley Artell - Ashley rises fast. From school plays to blockbuster movies, every performance cements her as the actress of her generation. Her rivalry with Walter becomes her most complex relationship. Working on the adaptation of Walter‚Äôs book‚Äîdirected by Derek Torey‚Äîexposes old resentments.She wants to be seen as a *real artist*, not just the pretty face or famous daughter. But Walter accuses her of being too shallow, too controlling. Their fights become legendary on set, but it also brings out the best in both of them. The film became a massive [hit.It](http://hit.It) earns Ashley her first Academy Award nomination‚Äîand Walter a screenwriting one. They walk the red carpet separately but stand together during the press conference. It‚Äôs awkward. And weirdly healing. Gabriel invites her to his acting class as a special guest occasionally.



Life of a Lowell



Alyssa Lowell - Robbie Quill, the undercover reporter, begins investigating Lowell Group after receiving an anonymous tip that the company is involved in fraudulent activities ‚Äî possibly misused funds, offshore accounts, or unethical business dealings. The tip seems credible and detailed, with internal financial documents, executive schedules, and even footage of confidential meetings. What Robbie doesn't know is that the source is James Chambers, Alyssa‚Äôs ex-husband, who is seeking revenge.

James is bitter over the divorce and his failed career. By targeting Alyssa‚Äôs company, he hopes to either blackmail her or ruin her completely. He knows how much she values her image as a powerful, flawless businesswoman ‚Äî especially after having been humiliated by him in her personal life. Exposing any skeletons in Lowell Group‚Äôs closet would crush her, professionally and personally.

As Robbie starts to get closer to the truth, Alyssa becomes suspicious of him. Her instincts are sharp ‚Äî she‚Äôs always been the type to sniff out lies. She eventually catches Robbie snooping and confronts him in a cold, intimidating fashion. But Robbie, who began the investigation to get a big scoop, is now conflicted ‚Äî because he starts seeing another side of Alyssa, especially in how she treats Jason and her quiet moments with Briar.

Briar, being the more empathetic twin, suggests they dig into where the leak came from. They soon uncover that James is behind the smear campaign. The revelation hits Alyssa hard, not because she's afraid of losing her company ‚Äî but because she realizes how vulnerable she was to a man who never loved her, and how much of her strength was really just emotional armor.

Robbie, faced with a moral decision, helps the Lowells by exposing James's manipulation publicly ‚Äî but not without conditions. He wants to publish the truth: not a hit piece, but a story about power, deception, and redemption ‚Äî including Alyssa's side.

In the aftermath:

* **Alyssa‚Äôs reputation takes a hit**, but she handles it head-on, holding a press conference that stuns the media with her honesty and composure.  
* **Jason learns the full story** about his father and becomes closer to Alyssa and Briar.  
* **Robbie and Alyssa form a tense alliance** ‚Äî not romantic at first, but full of mutual respect, leading to a *possible slow-burn romance*.  
* **James tries to disappear**, but ends up getting sued for slander and extortion. Barbara helps Alyssa take legal action

Briar Lowell - Grant Davenport initially joins Lowell Group as a fake intern, targeting Briar due to her softer personality. His original plan is to seduce her, gain access to confidential information or financials, and cash in ‚Äî either by blackmailing the company or selling intel. He‚Äôs smooth, attentive, and knows exactly how to mirror the kind of emotional support Briar rarely gets.

But what he doesn‚Äôt expect is to *genuinely fall for her.*

Briar is cautious but drawn to Grant's humor and warmth, something she feels is missing in the cutthroat world of business and even within her own family. For the first time, she feels *seen* and appreciated ‚Äî not just as Alyssa‚Äôs quieter twin or the passive co-CEO, but as her own person.

Over time:

* Grant finds himself *guilt-ridden*, delaying his scheme and trying to back out.  
* Briar, noticing his hesitation and emotional turmoil, starts asking questions. She‚Äôs *not as na√Øve as people think.*  
* When Robbie‚Äôs investigation into the company picks up speed, Grant realizes that continuing to hide the truth will destroy Briar ‚Äî and possibly get her blamed for the leak.  

Eventually, **Grant confesses everything** to Briar before anyone else finds out. She is devastated. Heartbroken not only because she trusted him ‚Äî but because she finally stepped out of Alyssa‚Äôs shadow only to fall flat.

However, instead of telling Alyssa or firing him on the spot, Briar does something that shocks everyone ‚Äî she *asks Grant to prove himself*.

Grant, determined to earn her forgiveness, helps the Lowell sisters uncover James‚Äôs role in the anonymous tip. He also provides intel on a separate financial scheme another board member is hiding, saving the company from potential disaster.

# Aftermath:

* **Briar finally asserts herself**, standing up to Alyssa, who is furious when she finds out about the romance.  
* She insists she can make her own choices, even if they‚Äôre messy.  
* **Grant stays on**, not as an intern, but in a legit capacity (PR or security/intel). He works under strict oversight ‚Äî Alyssa doesn't trust him, but Briar keeps him in check.  
* Their relationship grows slowly ‚Äî full of cautious moments and mutual rebuilding of trust.  
* It marks **Briar‚Äôs evolution** from passive twin to a more grounded, quietly powerful woman who learns to take risks and make her own decisions ‚Äî both in love and business.

Cheryl Lowell -¬†

# Phase 1: The Game Backfires

Cheryl starts off trying to ‚Äúwin‚Äù Billy back not out of love, but out of ego. Her efforts to manipulate Violet‚Äîteaching her to be more fashionable, drawing her away from Billy‚Äîare working on the surface, but they create two major consequences:

* **Violet‚Äôs Glow-Up** makes her blossom, and she starts gaining confidence *without* Cheryl. Violet starts drawing attention not just from Billy but also from others at Harvard.  
* **Billy‚Äôs Growing Resentment** turns into complete emotional detachment. He stops tolerating Cheryl‚Äôs presence altogether, calling her out for being toxic and manipulative in front of Violet. This stings more than any rejection she‚Äôs ever faced.  



# Phase 2: Reality Hits

Cheryl faces a *personal crisis* that shakes her to the core, her grades slip so badly she‚Äôs at risk of expulsion. With no one left to impress and no control over the situation, Cheryl is forced to reckon with her vulnerabilities. She realizes that her life of charm, beauty, and manipulation has left her emotionally empty and academically unfulfilled.

During this period:

* Violet offers her unexpected comfort or support, flipping the power dynamic between them.  
* Cheryl starts focusing on her studies *genuinely*, inspired by Violet and her mother Barbara‚Äôs legacy.  



# Phase 3: True Change

Cheryl begins to *rebuild*:

* She apologizes sincerely to Violet and Billy, not expecting forgiveness but acknowledging her wrongs.  
* She becomes more serious about her studies and law career‚Äînot just to impress others, but to prove to herself that she‚Äôs more than a pretty face or a spoiled heiress.  
* She mentors other insecure girls the way she mentored Violet‚Äîbut this time with sincerity and kindness.  



# Endgame Possibilities

* **Personal** Billy sees Cheryl in a new light and they reconcile‚Äînot necessarily as lovers but as friends who respect each other. Cheryl and Violet become true friends, not rivals. Violet helps Cheryl stay grounded, and Cheryl helps Violet open up to the world. Her relationship status can be anything; single, achieving her childhood dream of marrying William, somehow falling in love with Violet instead or a poly relationship with both William and Violet which she learns to share the love instead of being possessive.  
* **Professional:** Cheryl ends up being the most people-savvy and strategic lawyer of the next generation at Hunter & Johnson, using her charisma ethically to win cases and clients.



Daniel Lowell - He finds joy in performing in a band but struggles to balance studying and playing guitar in secret from his parents. He works out the courage to come clean to his parents with the help of his band members and Fabian Maddox. He gives them the tickets to the final stage of Battle of Bands that his band is joining and to his surprise, they show up and supports him when they see that he‚Äôs the happiest on stage( they say something like they are children of circus performers despite being professionals so they can understand the value of artistic value and performance). Actually, Thomas is still quite dissatisfied that he didn‚Äôt become a doctor like he expected but he can‚Äôt exactly force him into something he doesn‚Äôt want. Similarly, Barbara thought he would pursue medicine just like her nurse mother, Ivy Norris did but apparently the performer blood of the other grandparents overpower Ivy‚Äôs blood. She wonders if Cheryl and Daniel‚Äôs fates are swapped.¬†

Daniel manages to be the valedictorian at his school graduation and gives an emotional speech about chasing your passion and ends it with a poem he has written. Despite achieving good grades, he doesn‚Äôt get into any college and pursues music full time with his band. His band gained a lot of popularity enough to be the rival band of Marcus Lowell‚Äôs band. He didn‚Äôt expect to fall in love with Daphne Lowell, the ballerina sister of Marcus. Because of Daphne‚Äôs influence, he scores ballet productions, musical films, and even collaborates with symphonies. His biggest break is composing the soundtrack for a Broadway adaptation of *The Swan Ghost* with Daphne as the lead choreographer and principal dancer.  
  


Elliot Lowell - In his final year of high school, Elliot‚Äôs growing instability from the werewolf curse causes him to almost lose control during a major basketball game. He leaves the team afterward out of guilt and fear of hurting someone. He isolates himself, frustrated by his monstrous side and how it constantly sabotages anything he tries to care about‚Äîincluding the sport he loves.

After graduation, Elliot disappears for a while‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt go to college, doesn‚Äôt stay in touch. His relationship with Thomas is at its lowest point. But during this time, Elliot begins training himself‚Äîphysically, emotionally, mentally. He starts to *really* try to understand the curse. Eventually, he gives in and reads the journals his father wrote about controlling the wolf. It‚Äôs his first step toward healing.

When he returns home after a couple of years, it‚Äôs not with an apology‚Äîbut with a question:‚ÄúWill you train me? For real this time.‚ÄùThomas, shocked but grateful, agrees. They begin spending time together not just as werewolves, but as father and son. This is where Elliot starts to forgive‚Äînot only his father, but himself.

 With better control over his instincts and transformation, Elliot begins to dream again‚Äîthis time, of reclaiming his passion: **basketball**. He joins a college team under a fake name at first, testing if he can handle the pressure. Slowly but surely, his discipline, enhanced senses, and strength make him stand out‚Äînot as a monster, but as a phenomenal athlete.

Eventually, he returns under his real name and signs with a professional team. The public sees him as a quiet but powerful player, someone with a mysterious aura. His siblings, especially Daniel and Cheryl, become his biggest fans. Alyssa brags about him when no one‚Äôs around. Even Thomas cries at his first televised game.",1,1755659849.0,ChaoticAnalysis,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîdeath is the one thing none of us can dodge. That sounds grim, but if you tilt your perspective a little, it‚Äôs actually what makes life richer. Think about it: if we had unlimited time, would we really value small moments? Would your morning coffee taste as good if you had eternity to sip it? Probably not.  

I remember attending a funeral once where everyone told these warm, funny, imperfect stories about the person. What struck me wasn‚Äôt the loss, but the way his limited years forced him‚Äîand all of us who knew him‚Äîto cherish ordinary days. Mortality, in that sense, acts like a deadline. Deadlines are stressful, sure, but they also get us moving, keep us motivated, and remind us not to waste time on things that don‚Äôt truly matter.  

To die, then, is not just an end‚Äîit‚Äôs also what gives living its shape.

¬† He had the look of a man who was afraid that tonight would be his last on earth. And he had good reason to think so. The odds were fifty-fifty that it might be, and the percentage could go higher depending on how the next hour turned out.  
  
¬† The margin of error was that small.  
  
¬† The roar of the twin-engine boat moving at near full throttle wiped away the nighttime quiet on calm ocean waters. At this time of year the Gulf of Mexico was usually not so peaceful. This was typically the most active period of the hurricane season. While several storms were brewing out in the open Atlantic, none as yet had formed a firm center and entered the Gulf. Everyone on the coast was crossing his fingers and praying it would remain that way.  
  
¬† The fiberglass hull cut cleanly through the dense, salty water. The boat could hold about twenty people comfortably, but there were thirty folks on board. They were desperately gripping anything they could to keep from being bounced overboard. Despite the smooth waters, a boat carrying far too many people and moving at high speed was never very stable.  
  
¬† The captain piloting the boat did not care about the comfort of his passengers. His top priority was staying alive. He kept one hand on the wheel and the other on the dual throttles. He eyed the speed gauge with a worried look.  
  
¬† Come on. Come on. You can do this. You can make it.  
  
¬† Forty miles per hour. He pushed the throttles ahead and crept the speed stick up to forty-five. He was almost topped out now. Even with the twin stem-drive engines he wouldn‚Äôt be able to muster more speed without unduly depleting his fuel. And there were no marinas around here to provide more gas.  
  
¬† Even with the breeze created by the boat‚Äôs movement it was still hot out here. At least one did not have to worry about mosquitoes, not at this speed and this far from land. The man eyed the passengers one by one. It was not an idle observation. He was counting heads, although he already knew the answer. He had four crewmen with him. They were all armed, all watching the ‚Äúpassengers.‚Äù In a mutiny it would be five against one. But the passengers did not have submachine guns. One clip could take out every one of them with bullets to spare. And the majority were women and children, because that was where the real demand was.  
  
¬† No, he was not worried about a mutiny. He was worried about timing.  
  
¬† The captain checked his illuminated watch. It would be close. They had been late leaving the last outpost. Then their chart plotter had gone haywire for thirty nerve-racking minutes, sending them in completely the wrong direction. This was vast ocean. Every bit of it looked the same.  
  
¬† No landmass to aid in navigation. They were not in well-marked shipping channels. Without their electronic guidepost they would be screwed, like flying a plane without instrumentation in thick fog. The only outcome would be disaster.  
  
¬† But they had gotten the plotter straightened out, corrected course, and he had immediately pushed the stern-drives hard. Then he had pushed them some more. His gaze continued to flit to his dash, checking the oil, fuel, and engine temperature gauges. A breakdown out here would be catastrophic. They couldn‚Äôt exactly call the Coast Guard for assistance.  
  
¬† He futilely looked to the skies for eyes watching from up there. Unmanned eyes that would send back gigs of digital data about what they were seeing. He would never hear the response team until it was too late. The Coast Guard cutters would be on them before he could do anything. They would board, know immediately what was going on, and he would go to prison for a very long time, perhaps the rest of his life.  
  
¬† But he was not as scared of the Coast Guard as he was of certain other people.  
  
¬† He pushed the boat‚Äôs speed up to forty-seven and said a silent prayer that a vital engine part would not blow. He looked at his watch again. He counted the minutes in his head as he scanned the water ahead of them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll feed me to the sharks,‚Äù he muttered.  
  
¬† Not for the first time, he regretted agreeing to this business venture. Yet the money was so good he could not turn it down, despite the risks. He had done fifteen of these runs and figured with a similar number in the future he could retire to a nice, quiet spot in the Florida Keys and live like a king. It beat the hell out of driving his boat for pasty tourists from the North looking to land a tuna or marlin but more often simply puking all over his boat in rough seas.  
  
¬† But first I have to get this boat and these people where they need to go.  
  
¬† He eyed the red and green navigation lights on the bow. They gave a solemn glow to an otherwise moonless night. He counted more minutes in his head at the same time as he scanned the boat‚Äôs gauges.  
  
¬† His heart sank.  
  
¬† His fuel was running low. The stick was dipping perilously close to reserve status. He felt his gut tighten. They had too much weight. And the problem with the navigation system had cost them over an hour, many nautical miles, and precious fuel. He always added a fuel buffer of ten percent to be sure, but even this surplus might not be enough. He scanned the passengers again. Most were women and teenagers, but some were beefy men, easily over two hundred pounds each. And there was one man who was a true giant. But dumping passengers as a solution to his fuel issue was beyond problematic. He might as well put a gun to his own head and pull the trigger.  
  
¬† He swiftly redid the calculations in his head, just as airline pilots did after getting a full passenger and cargo manifest. It was the same question regardless of whether your ride was in the water or thirty thousand feet above it.  
  
¬† Do I have enough fuel to get there?  
  
¬† He caught the eye of one of his men and beckoned him over.  
  
¬† The man listened to his boss‚Äôs problem and did his own calculations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be tight,‚Äù he said worriedly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like we can start throwing people overboard,‚Äù said the captain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight. They have the manifest. They know how many we‚Äôre carrying. We start throwing them overboard, we might as well jump in too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTell me some shit I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù the captain snapped.  
  
¬† He made a decision and eased off the throttles, cutting their speed back to forty miles per hour. The dual props started spinning more slowly. The boat was still fully up on plane. To the naked eye there wasn‚Äôt a big difference between forty and forty-seven miles per hour on the water, but with the reduced fuel bum it could be the difference between running dry or making it. They would fuel up, and the return trip, with only five of them on board, would be no problem.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBetter to be a little late than not get there at all,‚Äù said the captain.  
  
¬† There was a hollow ring to his statement and the other man did not miss it. He clenched his weapon tighter. The captain looked away from him, his throat constricting as a cold dread gripped him.  
  
¬† To the people who‚Äôd hired him, timing was important. And being late, even by a few minutes, was never a good thing.  
  
¬† Right now the insane profit margin did not really seem worth it. You couldn‚Äôt spend money if you were dead.  
  
¬† But thirty minutes later, with his engines starting to suck on air instead of fuel, the captain saw his destination straight ahead. It rose out of the ocean like a throne for Neptune.  
  
¬† They were here. They were very late, but at least they‚Äôd made it.  
  
¬† He looked at the passengers. They too were staring at the structure, their eyes bugged out. He couldn‚Äôt blame them. Even though this was not the first such structure they had seen it was still a monstrous sight, especially at night. Hell, it still freaked him out, even after all the similar trips he‚Äôd made. He just wanted to dump his load, fuel up, and get his ass back to where he‚Äôd come from. As soon as the twenty-five passengers stepped off his boat they were someone else‚Äôs problem.  
  
¬† He slowed his engines and took his time docking alongside  
a floating metal platform tethered to the larger structure. After the ropes were secured, hands reached across and started pulling the passengers onto the platform, which bobbed up and down from the light chop created by the docking process.  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt see the larger ship that was normally waiting to take passengers onward. It must have already left with a load.  
  
¬† As the captain signed off on some documents and received his pay in plastic bundles taped down, he looked at the passengers as they were herded up a long metal stairway. They all looked terrified.  
  
¬† They should be, he thought. The unknown was not nearly as terrifying as the known. And he understood quite clearly that these people were well aware of what was about to happen to them. And they also knew that no one else cared.  
  
¬† They were not rich.  
  
¬† They were not powerful.  
  
¬† They were truly the forgotten.  
  
¬† And their numbers were growing exponentially as the world was settling swiftly into a permanent state of the rich and thus powerful and then everyone else. And what the rich and powerful wanted, they usually got.  
  
¬† He opened one of the plastic bundles. His mind did not immediately register what he was seeing. When it became apparent that what he was holding was cut-up newspaper and not money, he looked up.  
  
¬† The muzzle of the MP5 was pointed directly at him, less than ten feet away, held by a man standing on Neptune‚Äôs Seat. The MP was an awesome killing weapon at close quarters. It would prove so tonight.  
  
¬† The captain had time to put up his hand, as though flesh and bone would block shaped ordnance coming at him far faster than a jumbo jet could fly. When it hit him it did so with thousands of foot-pounds of kinetic energy. Twenty such rounds slammed into him at roughly the same time, shredding his body.  
  
¬† The impact of the spray of slugs knocked him off his feet and then over the gunwale. Before he sank beneath the waves the four other men on board joined him in the water. All shredded, all dead, they disappeared into the depths. The sharks would have a buffet tonight.  
  
¬† Punctuality was not only a virtue, it seemed, but also an absolute necessity.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 2  
  
¬† The vessel was immediately drained of its fuel, oil, and other fluids and then scuttled. Oil and gas created a large sheen on the water‚Äôs surface that could be seen from above by patrolling Coast Guard and DEA planes.  
  
¬† During the day the abandoned oil platform would look, well, abandoned. Not a prisoner in sight. They would all be inside the main structure safely away from view. Shipments of fresh product moved in and out only at night. During the day the operation shut down. The risk of being seen was too great.  
  
¬† There were thousands of shuttered oil platforms in the Gulf awaiting either demolition or else transformation into artificial reefs. Though laws required that the demolition or transformation take place typically within a year of abandonment, the actual time for that to happen could be much longer. And all the while these platforms, large enough to comfortably house hundreds, just sat there well out to sea. They were empty and ripe for exploitation by certain ambitious folks who needed a series of landing sites as they shepherded their precious cargo across broad waters.  
  
¬† As the vessel slowly sank into the deep Gulf, the passengers were herded up steel steps. They had been roped together and spaced a foot apart. The younger ones had a hard time keeping in step with the adults. When they fell, they were immediately jerked back into line and then beaten around the shoulders and arms. Their faces, however, were not touched.  
  
¬† One man, far bigger than the rest, kept his gaze downcast as he marched up the metal steps. He was over six-six and rock-solid, with broad shoulders and narrow hips, and thighs and calves easily the girth of a professional athlete‚Äôs. He also possessed the hard, bony musculature and near-gaunt features of a man who had grown up with not enough to eat. He would fetch a good price, but not as high as the girls, for obvious reasons. Everything was based on profit margins, and the girls, particularly the younger ones, had the highest margins of all. And that could be extended over at least ten years. By that time they would have collectively earned millions of dollars for their owners.  
  
¬† By contrast, his life would be relatively short as he was literally worked to death, or so his captors believed. ‚ÄúLMP,‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-margin product,‚Äù he would be called. The girls, on the other hand, were simply referred to as ‚Äúgold.‚Äù  
  
¬† He seemed to be mumbling to himself, but not in a language that anyone around him could understand. He missed a step and stumbled. Batons immediately rained down on his shoulders and the back of his legs. One struck him in the face, bloodying his nose. They were apparently not worried about his looks.  
  
¬† He rose and kept going. And kept mumbling.  
  
¬† The blows did not seem to have affected him.  
  
¬† There was a young girl in front of him who glanced back at him once, but he didn‚Äôt return her gaze. An older woman in line behind him shook her head and said a prayer in her native Spanish and then made the sign of the cross.  
  
¬† The man stumbled again, and again the beating took place. The guards jabbered at him, slapped him with their roughened hands. He took the punishment, rose, and kept going. And kept mumbling.  
  
¬† A shaft of heat lightning to the east illuminated the sky for about a second. Whether or not the man interpreted this event as some divine signal to act was unclear. His actions, however, were crystal clear.  
  
¬† He bulled past one guard, slamming into the man so hard that the guard pitched over the rail and plummeted down more than thirty feet, hitting and bouncing off the steel platform. His neck broke on impact and he lay still.  
  
¬† What was unnoticed was the sharp knife that the mumbling man had taken from the guard‚Äôs belt. It was his sole reason for attacking him. As the other gunmen lined up their shots, the man cut through his bindings, grabbed a life jacket hanging on a hook on the stair rail, slipped it on, and dove off on the opposite side from where the guard had gone over.  
  
¬† When he landed he did not hit steel. He slammed into the warm waters of the Gulf.  
  
¬† He broke the surface awkwardly and went under.  
  
¬† Seconds later a barrage of MP5 rounds ripped the surface of the water, creating hundreds of tiny whitecaps. A boat was sent out a few minutes later to look for him. But there was no sign. In the dark, he could have gone in any direction, and it was a lot of surface water to cover. The boat finally returned. The Gulf waters grew calm once more. He was probably dead, they thought.  
  
¬† If not he soon would be.  
  
¬† The remaining prisoners, twenty-four of them now, continued their slow ascent to the cells where they would be kept until another boat came to take them onward. They were placed mostly five to a cage. There they joined other prisoners who were also awaiting rides to the mainland. They were young, older, and in between. They were all foreigners, all poor or otherwise not part of any mainstream society. Some had been targeted and captured. Others had merely been unlucky.  
  
¬† As bad as that luck had been, it would only get worse once they left here.  
  
¬† The guards, mostly foreigners themselves, never made eye contact and did not even acknowledge the existence of their captives, other than when they slid plates of food and jugs of water inside the cages.  
  
¬† The captives were just nameless, meaningless bits of particle temporarily residing in the Gulf of Mexico. They sat on their haunches. Some stared out between the bars of the cages; most kept their gazes on the floor. They were defeated, resigned, unwilling to attempt a fight, or find a path to freedom. They seemed to have stoically accepted their fate.  
  
¬† The older woman who had been behind the large man would occasionally direct her gaze far down to the ocean‚Äôs surface. It would have been impossible for her to see anything in the water from the enclosed space. But once or twice she imagined that she had seen something. When the food and water came she ate and drank her small allotted share and pondered the man who had attempted an escape. She silently admired his bravery, even if it had cost him his life. At least he was free, if dead. That was far better than what awaited her.  
  
\> ¬† Yes, maybe he was the lucky one, she thought. She put a bit of bread in her mouth and took a sip of warm water from the plastic jug and forgot all about the man.  
  
¬† A half mile from Neptune‚Äôs Seat the man swam through the water. He looked back in the direction of the structure, now invisible to him. He had never intended to swim to shore from an oil platform. This was solely improvisation on his part. He had planned to take a plane from Texas to Florida. His current dilemma was the result of carelessness on his part that had resulted in his becoming a victim. But he had to get to land, and swimming there seemed to be the only way.  
  
¬† He adjusted the life jacket‚Äîwhich was too small for him but provided some needed buoyancy‚Äîand treaded water for a bit, trying to move as little as possible. Next he turned and started to float on his back. Darkness was when the sharks came out. Eventually, though, he would have to swim. Nighttime was the best time to do that, despite the dangers from the finned predators. Daylight would leave him exposed to many hazards, many of them man-made. Aided by the stars, which provided some needed navigational guidance, he set out in the direction that he believed to be toward land. He would occasionally look back at the platform, trying hard to solidify in his mind its location in the vastness of the Gulf. It was unlikely, he knew, but he might one day have to find it again.  
  
¬† His strokes were compact, seemingly effortless. With the buoyancy of the life jacket he could keep this pace up for hours. And he would have to, to get where he needed to go. He had decided to turn a possible catastrophe into an advantage.  
  
¬† He would head in the same direction another fast boat would have taken him at a later point in time. Perhaps he would beat his fellow captives to the final destination, if the sharks didn‚Äôt disrupt his plans by shearing off a limb or two and leaving him to bleed out alone.  
  
¬† His strokes became automatic, his breathing the same. This allowed his mind to wander and then focus on what lay ahead. The swim would be long and exhausting and fraught with peril. He could die at many points along the way. But he had survived much to get to this point. He would simply will himself to live.  
  
¬† He had to hope it would be enough.  
  
¬† It usually had been in a life marked more by tragedy and pain than by anything remotely approaching normalcy.  
  
¬† He stoically accepted it as his lot in life.  
  
¬† And he swam on.  
CHAPTER 3  
  
¬† The old woman was tall but bent. Her spine had curved itself over the last decade, and that had reduced her height by three inches. Her hair was cut short and in severe lines around her face, which had all the wrinkles and sun damage one would expect after more than eight decades of living, two of them in coastal Florida. She navigated with the aid of a walker, two tennis balls stuck onto the bottoms of the front legs for stability.  
  
¬† Her large hands clutched the top bar of the walker. Over her shoulder was her purse. It was large and bulky and rode awkwardly against her body. Her gait was steady and purposeful. She looked neither right nor left, nor over her shoulder. She was a woman on a mission and the passersby on the street voluntarily moved out of her way. Some smiled at what they no doubt believed was a dotty old woman who no longer cared what anyone thought about her behavior. It was true she no longer cared what others thought. But she was far from dotty.  
  
¬† Her destination was just up ahead.  
  
¬† A mailbox.  
  
¬† She ran her walker right up to it, using a free hand to balance herself against the stout property of the U.S. Postal Service. With her other hand she reached into her purse and pulled out the letter. She paused and looked at the address one last time.  
  
¬† She had spent considerable time writing the letter. The younger generation, with all of its tweets and Facebook and cryptic texts and emails where no actual language or grammar were involved, would never have understood taking the time to compose a handwritten missive such as this one. But she had wanted to get the words just right, because what she was writing about was so extraordinary. At least to her way of thinking.  
  
¬† The addressee‚Äôs name was written in block letters to make it as clear as possible. She did not want this piece of mail to go astray.  
  
¬† General John Puller, Senior (Ret.).  
  
¬† She was sending it in care of the VA hospital where she knew he was staying. She knew his health was not good, but she also knew that he was a man who could make things happen. He had risen nearly as high in the military as it was possible to go.  
  
¬† And he was also her brother. Her younger brother.  
  
¬† Big sisters were special to their little brothers. While they were growing up he had done his best to make her life miserable, playing an endless series of practical jokes on her, embarrassing her in front of her boyfriends, competing with her for their parents‚Äô affections. It was different when they became adults. Then it was like the grown man was desperately trying to make up for all the hardship he had caused his older sister.  
  
¬† She could count on him to sort this out. More to the point, he had a son, her nephew, who was very good at figuring things out. She reckoned this letter would eventually end up in his capable hands. And she hoped he came down here. It had been a long time since she had seen her nephew.  
  
¬† Too long.  
  
¬† She opened the lid of the mailbox and watched the letter slide down the metal gullet. She closed the lid and then opened it twice more just to make sure the letter was in the belly of the box.  
  
¬† She turned her walker around and made her way back to the cabstand. She had a favorite taxi driver who had picked her up from her home and now would drive her back there. She could still drive but chose not to tonight.  
  
¬† The mailbox was situated at the end of a oneway street. It was easier for him to park where he had, leaving her with only a short walk to the mailbox. He had offered to post the letter for her, but she had declined. She needed to do it herself, and she also needed the exercise.  
  
¬† He was a youngster to her, only in his late fifties. He wore an old-fashioned chauffeur‚Äôs hat, although the rest of his outfit was decidedly more casual: khaki shorts, blue polo shirt, and canvas boat shoes on his feet. His tan was so uniformly dark that it looked like the product of a UV bed or spray-on tan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you, Jerry,‚Äù she said, as she climbed, with his assistance, into the backseat of the Prius. Jerry folded up her walker and put it in the rear of the car before getting into the driver‚Äôs seat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEverything good to go, Ms. Simon?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI hope so,‚Äù she replied. For the first time she looked and felt truly nervous.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou want to go back home now?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, please. I‚Äôm tired.‚Äù  
  
¬† Jerry turned around in his seat and scrutinized her. ‚ÄúYou look pale. Maybe you should go see a doctor. Got enough of them in Florida.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe I will. But not right now. I just need some rest.‚Äù  
  
¬† He drove her back to her little community on the beach. They passed a pair of soaring palm trees and a sign set on a brick wall that read, ‚ÄúSunset by the Sea.‚Äù  
  
¬† The sign had always irritated her, because she lived by an ocean, not a sea. Technically, she actually lived on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the Panhandle of Florida. She had always thought that ‚ÄúSunset Coast‚Äù or ‚ÄúSunset Gulf‚Äô sounded better than ‚ÄúSunset by the Sea.‚Äù But the name was official and there was no changing it.  
  
¬† Jerry drove her to her house on Orion Street and saw her inside. A typical residence for this part of Florida, it was a two-story structure with cinderblock walls covered in beige stucco with a red terra-cotta roof and a two-car garage. The house had three bedrooms, with hers right off the kitchen. It was thirty-one hundred square feet in an efficient footprint, far larger than she needed, but she had no interest in moving. This would be her last home. She had known that for a long time.  
  
¬† She had a palm tree out front and some grass and decorative rocks in the yard. In the back a privacy fence ran along the property line, and she had a small reflecting pool along with a bench and a table where she could sit, drink her coffee, and enjoy both the cooler mornings and the final rays of the evening light. On either side of her house was another house pretty much exactly the same. All of Sunset by the Sea was pretty much the same, as though the builder had some large machine to spit the houses out off-site to later be transported and erected here.  
  
¬† The beach was behind her house, just a short drive or long walk to the sugar-white sand of the Emerald Coast.  
  
¬† It was summer and the temperature was in the low seventies at nearly six in the evening. That was about twenty degrees cooler than the high for the day, which was about average for Paradise, Florida, at this time of the year.  
  
¬† Paradise, she thought. A silly, conceited name, but she also couldn‚Äôt say it didn‚Äôt fit. It was beautiful here most of the time.  
  
¬† She would take heat over cold any day. That‚Äôs why they had invented Florida, she assumed. And perhaps Paradise in particular.  
  
¬† And why the snowbirds flocked here every winter.  
  
¬† She sat in her living room and gazed around at the memories of a lifetime. On the walls and shelves were photos of friends and family. Her gaze rested longest on a picture of her husband, Lloyd, a natural-born salesman. She had fallen in love with him after World War II. He had sold her a bill of goods, too, she supposed. He always claimed to be more successful than he was. He was a good salesman but a bigger spendthrift, she had found. But he was funny, made her laugh, didn‚Äôt have a violent bone in his body, never drank to excess, and he loved her. He never cheated on her, though with his job and the traveling involved, he certainly had had chances to wander from his marriage vows.  
  
¬† Yes, she missed her Lloyd. After he‚Äôd passed away, she‚Äôd discovered he had a sizable life insurance policy he‚Äôd kept in force. She‚Äôd taken the whole of it and bought two stocks. Apple and Amazon. This had been way back. The two A‚Äôs on her report card, she liked to call them. The investment return had been enough to allow her to pay off the mortgage on this house and live very comfortably on far more money than Social Security alone would have allowed her.  
  
¬† She had a light supper and some iced tea. Her appetite wasn‚Äôt nearly what it once was. Then she watched some TV, falling asleep in front of the screen. When she awoke she felt disoriented. Shaking her head to clear it, she decided it was time to go to bed. She rose with the aid of her walker and headed toward her bedroom. She would sleep for a few hours and then get back up, start her day over  
again. That was her life now.  
  
¬† She noticed a shadow of movement behind her, but had no chance to feel alarmed about it.  
  
¬† That was to be Betsy Puller Simon‚Äôs last memory.  
  
¬† A shadow behind her.  
  
¬† A few minutes later there was a splash from the backyard.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 4  
  
¬† The timing was as good as it would ever get. He performed a few more strokes in the water until he finally felt the earth beneath his feet.  
  
¬† He had lucked out and been picked up by a small fishing boat about two hours after his escape from the platform. The men had asked no questions. They gave him some food and water. They told him their location, and by reversing that course he got a better fix on the platform out in the Gulf. He could not forget all the prisoners housed there. They would be gone before he would ever return there. But there would be others to replace them.  
  
¬† The fishing boat could not take him all the way to shore, they told him, but they would get him close enough. They chugged along slowly for what seemed a long time and he helped them with their work as part repayment for their helping him. They could not make a beeline for his destination. They were out here to work, and work they would.  
  
¬† His great strength was marveled at by the fishermen, and they seemed sorry to see him go.  
  
¬† They pointed in the direction of land when they got to the place where he needed to get off. They gave him a better-fitted life jacket and he slipped over the side of the boat and started swimming toward land.  
  
¬† As he turned back he saw one of the men make the sign of the cross over his chest. Then his sole focus became reaching something he could stand on.  
  
¬† By the time he arrived on shore his muscles were tight, knotted, and he was once more dehydrated. Water had been all around him for such a long time and yet he had not been able to drink even a drop of it. Fish had nipped at him. Singly that was not a problem. Cumulatively, his legs and arms were covered in tiny cuts and welts. And his head and shoulders hurt from the beating he‚Äôd taken from the guards and from his plunge off the platform. He could feel the bruises and cuts on his face from these impacts.  
  
¬† But he was alive.  
  
¬† And on land.  
  
¬† Finally.  
  
¬† The darkness covered his high-stepping through the last few breakers until he reached the sugar-white sand of the Emerald Coast in Florida‚Äôs Panhandle. He looked right and left up the beach for any late-night beachcombers. Seeing none, he dropped to his knees, rolled onto his back, and drew in long deep breaths as he stared at a sky so clear there seemed to be no space between the billions of visible stars. Paradise was a small town with long beaches, but its downtown area was built right along the sand. The central business district was farther down and to the west. And luckily it was so late that there was no one out on the boardwalk that ran parallel to the beach where he was.  
  
¬† He thanked God for allowing him to live. So many hours of swimming, and then being picked up by the boat. In the vastness of the Gulf, what were the odds of that without divine intervention? The sharks had also miraculously left him alone. He had to attribute that to his prayers as well.  
  
¬† His captors had not come after him.  
  
¬† Prayer again.  
  
¬† Thankfully, the beach was deserted.  
  
¬† Well, not quite.  
  
¬† God must have missed that one.  
  
¬† He hunkered down in the sand as he heard the people coming.  
  
¬† Then he flattened himself to the beach and burrowed in, allowing his over six-foot-six-inch, 290-pound frame to blend into the white grit that people from around the world came to lie on during the course of a year.  
  
¬† It was two people. He could tell by the different voices.  
  
¬† One man. One woman.  
  
¬† He lifted his head a bare inch and stared in their direction. They were not walking a dog.  
  
¬† Prayer, again. A dog would have found his scent by now.  
  
¬† He would not act unless they spotted him. And even then, they might just assume he was simply lying on the beach enjoying the evening. He hoped they would not see him, and that if they did they would not panic. He knew that after his long journey at sea he must look pretty bad.  
  
¬† He tensed his body, waited for them to pass by.  
  
¬† They were within forty feet of him. The woman looked in his direction. The moonlight was not strong, but not weak either.  
  
¬† He heard her exclaim and then say something to her companion.  
  
¬† But then he realized that she was not actually looking in his direction.  
  
¬† As he watched, a lithe figure came out from behind the cover of sand dunes.  
  
¬† There was one pop and the man fell. The woman turned to run, but there was another pop and she fell too, hitting the compacted sand with a thud.  
  
¬† The figure put the gun away, gripped the woman‚Äôs hands, and dragged her into the water a good ten feet. The tide took over from there and the body quickly sank beneath the water and was swept out.  
  
¬† This same process was repeated on the man.  
  
¬† The figure stood on the sand a few inches from the water and scanned the breakers, probably making sure the bodies were not going to be swept back to shore. Then the figure turned and was gone the way it had come.  
  
¬† He kept his body flat to the stretch of beach even as he felt shame for not coming to the couple‚Äôs assistance. But it had happened so quickly that he doubted he could have prevented their deaths.  
  
¬† And sometimes God was busy with other things. This he knew to be true. God had often been busy when he had needed him. But then many people needed God. He was just one of billions who asked for divine assistance from time to time.  
  
¬† He waited until he was certain the shooter was gone. He had no idea why the couple had been killed. He had no idea who had killed them. It was not any of his business.  
  
¬† He could not remain on the beach now. He made his way to the boardwalk, and spotted a bicycle chained to a post. He ripped the post out of the ground, freeing the chain. He wound the chain around the frame, climbed onto the bike, and set off.  
  
¬† He had the city‚Äôs streets mostly memorized. He had a place to go, to stay, where he could change his clothes, rest, eat, hydrate, and then he could begin his quest, the real reason he had come here.  
  
¬† As he disappeared into the night, he began to mumble again, to pray for forgiveness for not helping the couple by killing their attacker. He was good at killing, perhaps the best. But that did not mean that he liked it, because he did not.  
  
¬† He was a giant, but actually a gentle man.  
  
¬† But even gentle giants could be moved to violence for the right reasons.  
  
¬† He had such reasons.  
  
¬† He had them in abundance.  
  
¬† He was no longer going to be gentle. Not while he was here.  
  
¬† It was the sole thing driving him. Indeed, it was the only thing really keeping him alive.  
  
¬† He rode on as the two corpses were pulled slowly out to sea.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 5  
  
¬† John Puller took a sharp left-hand turn and drove down the narrow two-lane road. In the backseat of the car was his cat, AWOL, who had wandered into his life one day and would probably leave him just as unexpectedly. Puller was in the Army, formerly a Ranger, and currently a CID, or Criminal Investigation Division, special agent. He was not investigating any cases at the moment. Right now he was just returning from a protracted road trip with his cat, allowing himself a bit of R&R after a hellish experience in a small West Virginia coal-mining town that had nearly ended with him and many other people dead.  
  
¬† He pulled into the parking lot of his apartment complex. It was near Quantico, Virginia, where the Army‚Äôs CID headquarters was located along with the 701st M.P. Group (CID), the unit to which Puller was attached. This made for an easy work commute, although he rarely spent much time at Quantico. He was more often on the road investigating crimes that involved a person who wore the uniform of the United States Army and yet was doing bad things. And unfortunately, there were a lot of cases to work.  
  
¬† He parked his car, a trim Army-issued Mal- ibu, grabbed his rucksack from the trunk, opened the back door, and wa  
ited patiently for AWOL, a fat orange-and-brown tabby, to mosey out. The cat followed him up to his apartment. Puller lived in six hundred square feet of rigid lines and minimal clutter. He had been in the Army for most of his adult life and now, in his mid-thirties, his personal aversion to junk and clutter was irreversibly established.  
  
¬† He got food and water out for AWOL, snagged a beer from the fridge, sat down in his leather recliner, put his feet up, and closed his eyes. He couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he‚Äôd actually gotten a full night‚Äôs sleep. He decided to do something about it right now.  
  
¬† The last few weeks had not been especially kind to Puller, who was nearly six feet four and a normally solid 232 pounds. He had not gotten any shorter, but he had lost about ten pounds because his appetite had abandoned him. Physically, he was still doing okay. He could beat any test the military might offer related to strength, endurance, or speed. Mentally, however, he was not doing very well. He wasn‚Äôt sure he ever would be doing well mentally again. Some days he thought he would, others not. This was one of the other days.  
  
¬† Puller had gone on the road trip to try to get his head back on straight after the ordeal in West Virginia.

1mv3grk,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mv3grk/my_mum_accused_me_of_trying_to_kill_my_newborn/,My mum accused me of trying to kill my newborn,"I gave birth a month ago to a beautiful baby girl as a young first time mum. I was raised by a narcissist mum and experienced heavy DV growing up from my parents and older sister although, my relationship with my dad and sister has improved and they‚Äôve since showed remorse for their actions. My mum liked to pretend that she didn‚Äôt remember what she did to me and as a result, I would have to store all her interactions with me in its own memory bank so that I could assure myself that I wasn‚Äôt going crazy whenever she would gaslight me and pretend she didn‚Äôt do anything. As a result, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and ptsd. I also have ocd and ADHD. 

I started showing signs of prenatal depression when I was pregnant but kept quiet about it. I had a traumatic birth with many complications from the epidural I had that required my mum to come and stay with me the first two weeks after giving birth in which my husband and her mostly looked after baby and I rested and just pumped. I was mostly just giving my daughter breastmilk but recently my baby started drinking double and I wasn‚Äôt making enough milk so I had to use formula as well. My mum showed me how to make the formula by filling a bottle from the tap and then adding the formula powder and swirling it around. My husband was also there. 

That‚Äôs how we‚Äôve been making the formula the past few weeks. My parents came over on the weekend and my husband went to make some formula when my mum absolutely berated him for using tap water and said he needed to use sterile water, he was confused as she had not told us that.
I was sleeping at the time and when I woke up, she proceeded to lay into me and said ‚Äú who taught you how to make formula like that?‚Äù I said ‚Äú you did‚Äù 
‚Äú no I fkn didn‚Äôt why are you lying?‚Äù 
‚Äú mum you literally showed me how to do it from a tap‚Äù
‚Äú I showed you by boiling water and waiting for it to cool and then putting it in the bottle. Why are you making me out to be a liar for?‚Äù
I told her I remember vividly her showing me from the tap
She then goes ‚Äú why are you trying to kill your child? You‚Äôre not right in the head, there‚Äôs something wrong with you. You‚Äôre not fit to look after your child, what kind of mum are you? ‚Äù she says all this while holding my baby, and my intrusive thoughts kicked in telling me she was going to take my child. 

I told my husband what happened and he came home immediately. My dad berated me and told me that my mum wouldn‚Äôt do that and she knows how to make formula and I have to be remembering it wrong. I went upstairs and broke down and my husband came home and brought the baby up. My mum stormed out and demanded to my dad for them to leave. I messaged my sister about what happened and my sister took my mums side and said my mum was justified for being angry at me and saying those things. My husband was the only one who had my back. It‚Äôs triggered an episode and I feel like complete shit and a shit mum, feeling like I don‚Äôt deserve my baby. My mum is now calling me and telling me to talk to her but I can‚Äôt and my family is telling me to do the same. For context, 2 weeks before, her and my dad had come over and she had grabbed a bunch of my flavoured coffee sachets to use. I asked her nicely if she could choose another flavour as that flavour is one of my safe foods ( I‚Äôm also on the autism spectrum) and its limited edition. She got pissed off and called me selfish and that she didn‚Äôt teach me to be like this and that I don‚Äôt care for other ppl, she then proceeded to tell the family who of course took her side. A week after, she came over randomly and dropped stuff off at the door and drove off without warning or alerting anyone, she didn‚Äôt even come in to see her grandchild. We live at least 45 minutes away ( on a bad day it can take an hour or more to get here), coming all that way and not even seeing her grandchild. I‚Äôm worried about how this will affect my baby when she‚Äôs old enough to understand, and my mum doesn‚Äôt seem to care about the impact her decisions have on ppl.

1mv3ff8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1mv3ff8/is_it_vestibular_migraines_or_pppd/,Is it Vestibular Migraines or PPPD?,"Hi! I recently joined this community and I needed to get some answers about my VM case. 

My experience with dizziness and vertigo first began when I was 19, 11 years ago. I started visiting every specialist in town and I didnt receive a diagnosis that explained my symptoms. Some doctors thought it may be caused by neck tension and flat neck; others said it was anxiety. It wasnt until last september that my prayers were answered, bc an ENT diagnosed me with vestibular migraines and vestibular hypofunction after some vestibular function tests showed that one of my inner ears works at 50% efficiency.

However, my symptoms do not include headaches, spinning vertigo or dizziness episodes that come and go. My dizziness or lightheadedness began as vertigo episodes that lasted for 30 mins or so, but they became chronic 24/7 lightheadedness (like being tipsy) after having a cup of coffee; it was at this moment that I got so sick I thought I was going to die, and these vertigo episodes that I had been suffering from for a week turned into chronic 24/7 dizziness and lightheadedness, with oscillopsia, sensitivity to lights, sounds, smells and coffee. 

The problem is the following: the ENT told me to keep a journal and log vertigo episodes for him to check on our next visit in 3 months, but my symptoms are not episodic, they are chronic and I only get spinning vertigo episodes (with increased heartbeat and near-blackout symptoms) when feeling nervous or anxious about sth, such as during public speaking sessions, job interviews or uncomfortable situations. 

So, is this really vestibular migraines with vestib hypofunction or just PPPD with an anxious component? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Have a great day.

1mv3dki,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1mv3dki/is_it_really_vestibular_migraines/,Is it really Vestibular Migraines?,"Hi! I recently joined this community and I needed to get some answers about my VM case. 

My experience with dizziness and vertigo first began when I was 19, 11 years ago. I started visiting every specialist in town and I didnt receive a diagnosis that explained my symptoms. Some doctors thought it may be caused by neck tension and flat neck; others said it was anxiety. It wasnt until last september that my prayers were answered, bc an ENT diagnosed me with vestibular migraines and vestibular hypofunction after some vestibular function tests showed that one of my inner ears works at 50% efficiency.

However, my symptoms do not include headaches, spinning vertigo or dizziness episodes that come and go. My dizziness or lightheadedness began as vertigo episodes that lasted for 30 mins or so, but they became chronic 24/7 lightheadedness (like being tipsy) after having a cup of coffee; it was at this moment that I got so sick I thought I was going to die, and these vertigo episodes that I had been suffering from for a week turned into chronic 24/7 dizziness and lightheadedness, with oscillopsia, sensitivity to lights, sounds, smells and coffee. 

The problem is the following: the ENT told me to keep a journal and log vertigo episodes for him to check on our next visit in 3 months, but my symptoms are not episodic, they are chronic and I only get spinning vertigo episodes (with increased heartbeat and near-blackout symptoms) when feeling nervous or anxious about sth, such as during public speaking sessions, job interviews or uncomfortable situations. 

So, is this really vestibular migraines with vestib hypofunction or just PPPD with an anxious component? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Have a great day.

*Where the Odds Are as Tight as a Salsa Dancer‚Äôs Schedule*

**Parsing the Odds: A Dead Heat More Exciting Than a Draw**  
The numbers scream parity. Both Fenerbah√ße and Benfica sit at near-identical odds: **2.5 (decimal)**, translating to **40% implied win probability** each. The draw? A bloated 3.5 (28.5%), as if bookmakers are gasping at the thought of these teams sharing points. This is a toss-up more thrilling than a coin flip in a hurricane. Spreads are evenÈí±‚Äîno points, just a 1.85-1.89 price range, meaning bettors are being paid almost even money to wager on either side. Totals hover around 2.75 goals, with ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù slightly favored (1.78-1.98). In short: expect a tactical duel, not a fireworks show.

**Digesting the News: Young Blood, Old Souls**  
Both teams boast Colombian prodigies. **Jhon Jader Dur√°n**, Fenerbah√ße‚Äôs 20-year-old forward, is the Turkish league‚Äôs answer to a Colombian coffee bean‚Äîsmall, potent, and keeping everyone awake at night. Meanwhile, **Richard R√≠os**, Benfica‚Äôs midfield maestro, is like a *salsa* dancer with a spreadsheet: equal parts flair and algorithmic precision. Neither has a injury scuppering their plans‚Äîthankfully, no ‚Äútripped over shoelaces‚Äù mishaps here. Benfica‚Äôs Ukrainian goalkeeper **Anatoliy Trubin**? A human paralyzer who turns saves into performance art.

Fenerbah√ße‚Äôs edge? Home advantage at ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium, where the roar is loud enough to wake the Ottoman Empire. Benfica‚Äôs trump card? Their Lisbon return leg, where the humidity is as thick as their history of qualifying drama.

I personally don‚Äôt drink alcohol or caffeinated drinks due to personal preference, but I do know that milk does tend to come up when I don‚Äôt want it too. (I‚Äôve looked into the possibility of being lactose intolerant, and it only happens with milk and a little bit with almond milk)

First, I wanted to take some pics with the hood open, and it wouldn't stay up. I made a folding hood support with a piece of craft wire. I drilled a hole in the radiator support, bent the end of the wire at 90 degrees and stuck it through the support. Now the support folds down when not needed, Then the bed looked a bit empty, and the rear was sagging a bit. The tool box and jack actually came with the kit, so I painted them and stuck them in there. Then I dug through my parts box and found the tranny and engine, I filled in the front of the tranny a bit, and added a shaft for some interest. The tranny came from a Mobius Ford Truck kit. Then I built the engine, it came from a Revell hot rod kit. I drilled out the spark plug holes, and intake manifold. I cut the belts off a pulley set, and put the crank and water pump pulley on for a bit of realism. I drilled out the ends and made flanges for the parts box headers cause they didn't quite cover the holes in the heads. I also drilled out the flanges and added pin heads as bolts. The last thing was a dipstick. The engine looked silly just laying in the back, so I built the pallet out of basswood and coffee stirrers. The tie downs were done with Frog tape cut down to size with some craft wire bent to resemble buckles. I might have to make a mini diorama to have something ""to put the engine in"".

# (and Why You Should Care!)

Welcome everyone! Since this is our very first post, let‚Äôs go back to the absolute basics of electronics ‚Äî the stuff that makes your phone glow, your fan spin, and your toaster‚Ä¶ well, toast. 

# 1. Electricity is just‚Ä¶ lazy!

Electrons always want to move from a place of higher energy (voltage) to lower energy. Think of them like people at a wedding buffet ‚Äî rushing from ‚Äútoo much food‚Äù to ‚Äúempty plates.‚Äù That movement? That‚Äôs current. 

# 2. The Trio of Power: V = I √ó R

This is the *Ohm‚Äôs Law*. Voltage (V) pushes, Current (I) flows, Resistance (R) slows it down. Imagine water in a pipe: Voltage is water pressure, Current is the flow, and Resistance is the narrowness of the pipe. Except, unlike water, electricity can shock you into remembering the formula forever. 

# 3. Components are Like Characters in a Sitcom

* **Resistors**: The strict parents (they limit everything).
* **Capacitors**: The chill ones storing energy for later.
* **Diodes**: The bouncers at the club ‚Äî only letting current in one way.
* **Transistors**: The dramatic ones ‚Äî they can switch ON/OFF or amplify like turning up your karaoke mic. 

# Why Learn This?

Because once you get these basics, you can build anything ‚Äî from blinking LEDs to robots that make your coffee (well, someday).

So tell me: What was the **first electronic component** you ever used or broke?",1,1755658340.0,Dynavation,0,1.0,False

1mv34ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mv34ol/fn_after/,[FN] After,"How long have I been sleeping? I don't remember going to the beach, what am I doing here? He stood up slowly, he felt groggy, like when you wake up and then go back to sleep and then wake up an hour later. He was disoriented, but had the sudden urge to walk. It was like there was an invisible force leading his hand, guiding him in the direction he needed to go. The air was crisp and salty, the colors seemed brighter ‚Äì like when he was a child. Focusing on the sound of the beautiful bright blue ocean and taking notice of the occasional seagull that flew by overhead, and basking in the warm glow of the cloudless day, it was the perfect temperature. He did not know how long he had walked for, as he walked he did not grow fatigued, not the slightest bit. Eventually he saw an object far down along the beach, he couldn‚Äôt quite make it out, so he kept walking towards it. What is that? It looks like a person sitting at a desk? He kept walking towards the stranger. Hello sir, wonderful afternoon we're having isn‚Äôt it, the man at the desk said when he made it over to him. Ummmm, sure. Come, have a seat. Anything to drink? Water, coffee, juice? Ummm, I guess I'll have a cup of water. And seemingly out of thin air a water cup appeared in front of him ‚Äì it was as if he had blinked and it was there. He looked at the man sitting across from him to see if he looked just as confused as he was. But the man just smiled at him warmly and began to hurl questions at him. So sir, what is your name? Bailey, he replied. Your parents just stop at Bailey? Bailey Woods. The man wrote something down on the note pad he had on the table in front of him. Alright Mr, Woods and how old are you? I‚Äôm 26, he replied. Great, and do you have any children? No. A spouse or partner perhaps? No. I see, the mysterious man replied. Now then, do you think about death often? Excuse me? Do you think about death often, the man said again. What kind of a question is that? What kind of a question do you think it is, the man asked. A strange one. I see. He wondered how long this strange man would be asking him questions, and more importantly if he would be able to ask any questions of his own. And it was as if the man across from him had peered into his mind. So sir, do you have any questions for me? Yes, where am I? Bailey replied although a little stunned. You are nowhere. I‚Äôm Nowhere? Yes, and everywhere at the same time. How can that be possible? I don‚Äôt know. You don‚Äôt know. You see sir, I don‚Äôt make the rules. You‚Äôre not being very helpful. I am sorry to hear that Mr, Woods, if you would like to, you are more than welcome to lodge a formal complaint and leave it in the complaint box. He looked around the table but could not find any such box. I don‚Äôt see anything that looks like a complaint box, he said. Oh that‚Äôs right I forgot, the box has gone in for repairs. The box has gone in for repairs? Yes Sir. After a couple seconds of defeated silence Bailey spoke. You're not very funny either. Well I happened to think it was quite funny. Now Mr, Woods if you would kindly step into that door over there to your right you will be commited over to processing. And out of nowhere yet again a single oak door appeared on the sand. Okay I‚Äôm starting to get freaked out. It‚Äôs okay sir all of this will make sense soon enough, or it won‚Äôt, that‚Äôs really up for you to decide. Giving the man a concerned look Bailey reluctantly got up from his seat and walked slowly over to the magic door. He looked back at the man with doubt, but he just smiled and gestured for him to open the door and step through it. With one deep breath and a long exhale, he slowly opened the door. There was nothing but black on the other side, he could not tell if he would fall into a bottomless pitch black pit once he stepped through the door. But once again he was compelled to move by a force greater than he could understand, he stepped through the door.¬†

¬†	This time when he woke up he found himself laying on a fallen tree log in the middle of a lush green forest. There was a tall lanky youthful looking woman standing over him. Hello, the woman said in a tone that sounded maternal and comforting. Hello, he replied back. My name is Bailey, he began to say but was quickly cut off by the women. Oh, no, no dear I already know your name you needn‚Äôt tell me. Okay, what is your name then. I go by many names dear, but you may call me Iris. Okay. She held out her hand to him to help him up off the ground. She pulled him to his feet as if he were as light as air, he barely had to do any work at all to stand up. Now then, let's take a walk shall we. She did not wait for a response from him and turned around and began slowly walking away from him. He followed her without a second thought. He didn‚Äôt know how to explain it but he felt that he could trust her. He walked quickly to catch up with the woman. They walked in silence for a few minutes, then he asked, so where are you taking me? You will see soon enough, she replied. Okay. It wasn‚Äôt much of an answer but he accepted it all the same, maybe it was just that he had become accustomed to receiving vague answers at this point. So who are you? I told you already my name is Iris. No but I mean who are you exactly, why are you here helping me? I am your guide, a friend to help you through this process. What process are you talking about exactly? The transfer process, transferred to what? To your next life. He stopped walking for a moment in stunned silence. So wait, what are you saying, are you telling me that I'm‚Ä¶ dead? Yes that's right dear, you are indeed dead. He couldn‚Äôt find the words to speak. Look dear I know that this is a lot to process but we really need to get going, we are on a very tight schedule you see. So am I in heaven right now? No dear, you are just going through what your brain feels like it needs to go though, all people have different experiences after dying, it is not a cookie cutter one size fits all thing. I feel like I should be more freaked out by this. Do you want to be more freaked out? No, I'm just saying that I feel like I should be more freaked out or angry or something, seeing how my life is over, and at such a young age, there was still so much I wanted to do. Like what, she asked. I don‚Äôt know like seeing the grand canyon or going sky diving or maybe having a family, you know shit like that. You can still do all those things in your next life, it just won't be you directly doing those things. Now come dear we are running behind schedule, come walk with me. He once again followed her deeper into the forest. So how did I die? I can't remember a single thing about it. It doesn't matter now, you are dead, your previous life is over and you are moving on to the next, knowing that information will only serve your soul unnecessary turmoil. I still want to know. She responded with only silence, making her stance clear to him. So earlier when you said that I could still do all the things I wanted to do but not directly, what did you mean by that exactly? The human soul is one composed of many from previous lives. So when you move on to your next life, who you were will make up a tiny portion of the next body that will house your soul. Does that answer satisfy you? Yeah, I guess so. Ah, we're finally here. After what seemed like hours, or maybe days, he couldn‚Äôt quite tell, time seemed to move slowly here, it was good for reflection. He could remember everything about his life in perfect detail, even the memories from when he was child that he had forgotten a long time ago, and the things he had tried to forget. And still, the only moment he could not remember was his death, though he tried not to speculate since he knew that no good would come of it anyway. They had arrived at a cliff face overlooking the ocean. It was cold and windy. Dark clouds lined the sky as the sun just barely showed through. The grass was tall and lush. Iris walked closer to the edge of the cliff. He followed her. Alright this is the end for you. The end? Yes, now I want you to jump. You want me to jump? Yes, I want you to run and jump off into the water. Are you crazy? I'll die for sure. But you‚Äôre already dead. Right I know but I just mean that it doesn't make sense. Bailey dear, the dead can‚Äôt die, they can only be born again. So if I jump off this cliff, I'll be reborn as someone completely new? Yes dear that‚Äôs right. Will it hurt, being born? No dear you wont feel a thing. Okay. He was quick to convince because he had no reason not to trust her. And with that he turned around and began to walk back the way he came. He was scared a little bit, but there was something clawing at the back of his head that gave him so much courage it seemed to cancel out that fear entirely. His footsteps felt light. He experienced a kind of clarity he had never felt before. After walking about 20 steps he turned back around again. He looked around for Iris, but like so many things in this strange realm she had vanished. He took one deep breath in filling his entire body, and took a long exhale out. He began to run, he ran with some much conviction and determination, in that moment he felt he could do anything, he knew he had the power to do whatever he put his mind to. Once he approached the edge he lept into the air. Time seemed to move in slow motion. All his inhibitions lifted from his shoulders and he felt relief, he had had no idea how much weight was holding him down all this time, he felt as light as a feather. He felt so much peace. The water crashed against the rocks. He did not feel fear anymore, only the hope swelling inside his chest. He looked out over the sunset, it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. And with that he hit the surface of the water, and was born again.",1,1755658181.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Figured I‚Äôd post my experience to help others who were as confused as me when I tried to plan my trip. I found an itinerary from Reddit that I mainly copied but also took a gander at a bunch of other ones which were similar. Also went off of recs from friends!

For the duration of our stay, we stayed at an Airbnb in Whitefish just because we wanted to stay somewhere lively. We also rented a car and we were only going to take a shuttle if we were unable to snag passes. I would consider myself a good/moderate hiker so keep that in mind when it comes to my experience!

Day 1 (Thu, 8/14): Avalanche Lake
- We landed around noontime. Could not check into Airbnb until 4p so we decided to go avalanche lake.
- Went to folklore coffee prior and to Safeway to stock up on snacks prior to hike. Ôªø
- Had to go through Sun Road after 3p since we did not need passes. We did buy a weekly pass for our vehicle. No lines really to get through.
- ÔªøWas easy to park on site for avalanche.
- The hike itself wasn‚Äôt that hard. I would say maybe moderate to easy imo, it was more like a walk in the woods to me. Clocked in 4.3 miles and a moving time of 1:44.
- ÔªøStopped at lake mcdonald lodge (~20 min from avalanche), didn‚Äôt want to wait for sunset so we went back home.

Day 2 (Fri, 8/15): The Garden Wall via Highline
- ÔªøLeft early AM since we didn‚Äôt reserve tickets to sun road. Arrived to Logan pass by 630a and snagged one of the last parking spots! Beautiful sunrise when we got there!
- Saw a bear and two cubs from afar on the way up. Also saw some deer. Lots of cute marmots.
- Ôªøhighline trail itself is not a bad hike, pretty moderate I want to say, just getting up the garden wall killed me a bit. 
- ÔªøGarden wall: beautiful views up top! Was very windy and cold once sun disappeared. This part was hard ugh! But it‚Äôs totally doable if you pace yourself, which I did not.
- Decided to do the chalet since we were already there. It was ok imo, nothing compared to garden wall. But there‚Äôs smelly toilets and a place to buy snacks/drinks.
- The only thing I hated about this hike was going back it was never ending lmao after having no fuel left. I don‚Äôt think I had enough snacks, had plenty of water though since it wasn‚Äôt hot that day, sprinkled a bit too.
- Clocked 16.7 miles, and a moving time of 7:08.

Day 3 (Sat, 8/17): Three Waterfall Trail
- ÔªøGoes to Baring, St. Mary's and Virginia falls
- Needed Sun road pass that we got night before but left sometime in the afternoon without issue.
- Parked at Sun point per people from AllTrails which we did not have any issues finding or parking.
- This was also more like a nature walk to me. Was a very chill time. First waterfall small, second one medium and very blue!, and third one bigger but was ok, nothing amazing imo since waterfall hikes don‚Äôt really amaze me haha.
- We just wanted to take it easy that day to recover from garden wall. The weather was gloomy anyway so it was chill. The drive back was cloudy and beautiful all around Logan pass! Very twilight-esque.

Day 4 (Sun, 8/17): Grinnell Glacier
- you need a shuttle pass to get to many glacier!
- My two friends and I tried to get tickets right at 7p the night before with no luck! Sold out in seconds. If you keep refreshing though you might get lucky like me! Maybe thirty min after it opened I snagged one for myself, an hour later I snagged another one, and at dinner my friend snagged one ‚Äî we got so lucky and all got for the same time (8-9)!
- There are nine lots you can park at, we parked at #9 because it‚Äôs closest to whitefish (still over two hour drive lmao). However, they start picking up at #9 then reverse. Parking was easy, and was not busy. We got there at 830ish and the shuttle showed up closer to nine. We weren‚Äôt fighting for a seat thank goodness, and the process went smoothly. There were about 45 people by the time we got to many glacier hotel.
- We were able to use the restroom at the hotel and stock up on things if needed.
- Grinnell glacier: did not do boat because it was sold out, but honestly didn‚Äôt need to do it because this hike was a piece of cake compared to garden wall! Clocked 11 miles and moving time of 5:04. I would consider this hike moderate. People said the end was hard, but I think I‚Äôd beg to differ.
- Saw some big horned sheep, goats, and deer along the way. People also saw some moose. I saw snakes every now and then unfortunately ugh.
- The glacier was nice! It got cold as we got closer but nothing intolerable. The trail overall was beautiful, I kept getting distracted by wanting to take pictures at every stop!
- We didn‚Äôt wait too long for a shuttle back either, was not crowded, maybe because it was a Sunday?

Day 5 (Mon, 8/18):
- chill day before leaving after all that hiking!
- We never got to do hidden lake unfortunately but I was ok with it because we did so much hiking and enjoyed them all!
- We ended up getting brunch in whitefish, took the chairlift up whitefish ski resort, did some alpine slides, and went kayaking.
- For dinner we went to Abruzzo for Italian. We highly recommend it!

Overall, great GNP experience. Glad we stayed in whitefish as we always had something to do and it was lively (we like to hike, but we also love to eat and drink out!). The only one negative I would say is that the people we encountered in whitefish were not friendly! I was told they do not like tourists and are ‚Äúburned out‚Äù by August, which I don‚Äôt think it is an excuse to treat people coldly? I‚Äôm from a touristy capital and I don‚Äôt use that as an excuse to act like a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and brush people off. We met other people that felt the same, so that was validating haha. It was funny to feel like a fish out of place in whitefish when going to bars and even some of the restaurants, sheesh! But I came for the hiking I suppose, and that did not disappoint!

Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about planning! Happy to help because planning this trip was confusing af until we were finally there and learned after our first day haha.",31,1755658119.0,GlacierNationalPark,2,0.95,False

So a couple of weeks ago my son (6) has a weighted stuff T-rex that you throw in the microwave and it heats up and apparently is very soothing. (It really works for infants and toddlers that are restless at night), anyway, his Rex got a decent rip down the side at the stitches, this thing was NOT cheap and his mom was gonna toss it and save to get another one. I was like oh heck no that sheit was to expensive. So I went and grabbed my sewing kit (yes I, a 38YO man knows how to sew, and I'm pretty good at it free hand, no machine needed) and I opened the box and started pulling the thread out and needles and his mom looked at me like a was the weirdest thing she ever seen. Apparently no one taught her how to preform a sewing task. (That's part one, why have kids not learned how to sew, and cook, what i real vacuumed is,) when I was 13 is was able to pull a 68 SS t transmission and motor out, tear the motor down and rebuild it with little help from my granddad.

Anyway, so I'm sitting there sewing his Rexy, and here comes my little football sized mixed breed dog flying around the living room around my coffee table and using the two sides of the couch like the sloped left hand turns in a NASCAR race. About the time I went to get on to him he found that on the seat of the couch laid my sewing box with 100'S of needles, thimbles, pin cushions, scissors you know everything you need to mend just about anything you can come across. Well he landed on the open top of the box and before I could even blink I saw in slow motion how the dog freaked out because he laned on something hard and noisy, then the other side that's almost slap full get flug over his head like a boulder being released from a catapult. 

Well I cleaned it all up took me almost a hour we'll couple weeks go by and I am in my living room turning everything off ready for bed and I turned to go upstairs..... and I felt a sharp ass pain in my foot. I hobble over the the chair and sure enough I found the last needle in the hay stack.... I hope... The needle went through my sock (of course) into the joint between my big toe and ball of my foot where I had to pull it out quick like ducttape hopping it won't hurt but it still hurts just all at one time. The damn needle was damp near two inches long and only thing sticking out of my foot was the eye of the needle.

TL;DR had a whole box of sewing tools flung over my living room a few weeks ago by my dog, thought I got them all up until tonight when I slide my foot across the the rug where a 2 inches needle went through my toe and damp near into my joint of my big bone.",3,1755658100.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

Two things are extremely important to me: I want covered parking that I don‚Äôt need to walk to; can be a ramp next door or included, but I‚Äôm from Duluth and I HATE the cold and snow so this is key for not hating living there again. Also, I want in-unit laundry; this is just another one that vastly improves my quality of life. 

I love the Mount Royal Neighborhood but Bluestone is also hard to get into and really expensive, so I would be lucky to catch a 1 bedroom in the middle next month or so.

I‚Äôve lived in city centers in large cities for the last 15 years so I actually like noise and humans doing human things around me.

Last year around October this thing  terrorized me and my family for a few nights. It started with it just bothering me so I thought I was just seeing things, until two of my sisters saw it in the driveway one night while they were taking out the trash. They both ran back inside and we locked the house and for the rest of the night we were scared and heard it outside just walking around, even saw it a few times. We called the cops because we hoped it was some  jerks playing a prank on us, but the cops got here and saw no footprints just animal tracks all around the house. They left, and when we all went to bed I was the only one that slept in my room (my sisters piled up in the living room) and for the rest of the night I heard it tapping against my window and trying to get me to go outside. I didn‚Äôt fall asleep until the sun went up because I was so scared. After that, my mom and sister saged the whole property and some other things I can‚Äôt remember.

Tonight, I went for a walk. The sun was almost down, and I really wanted a coffee so I decided to walk to our local dollar store. It was a thirty-forty minute walk so I knew I could make it before they closed because I‚Äôve done it before. As soon as I‚Äôm out of the driveway and walking up a hill to the main road, I hear something growling and I think it‚Äôs a dog so I keep walking. I start feeling like something‚Äôs following me so I tell myself to just make it the park and I‚Äôll turn back around and lose it on one of the side roads. I‚Äôm texting my friends while this is happening and one of my friend and his mom drives by and asks if I need a ride back home. At this point I‚Äôm basically home and I figured their car scared it off so I tell them I‚Äôm okay and that I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience but I‚Äôm almost home so I don‚Äôt need it anymore. They turn back around and the moment their cars out of sight I turn and it‚Äôs standing just out of view of the street lamp. It was grey and had weird human animal face with wide eyes that looked sunken in and it looked angry. It was in the position a frog gets in before it jumps for something.

I run so fast and I turn the ten minute walk home into a six minute run and I don‚Äôt stop, I didn‚Äôt even know I fell until my sister pointed out my stained pajamas pants and asked if I fell.

I then stay and work for a few hours, periodically filing my mug with more coffee/tea/sometimes fountain drinks. 

From a workers perspective - is this strange? Should I make the order with a cashier instead of the kiosk so they dont think I am freeloading? Am I worrying about nothing?

I ask because I rarely see people bringing their own mug even though I am in LA. At the same time, sometimes there are not even workers at the cash register to take your order, so putting in the order at the kiosk is the only option. ",5,1755657802.0,Panera,7,0.78,False

I just moved back to India and have been pretty unhappy with the waters I‚Äôve tried for coffee brewing so far. 

I‚Äôve used my home RO system (it produces a TDS of roughly 70 ppm though I don‚Äôt know the composition) and I just tried Kinley bottled water (measured about 59 ppm). I prefer water with a low bicarbonate content (I tend to sit around 15 ppm though as high as 40 is okay sometimes) to bring out more of the coffee‚Äôs acidity. I‚Äôm more flexible with Magnesium and Calcium levels and don‚Äôt mind anywhere between 0 and 90 ppm.

Before I get the Zero Water jug, what do you guys turn to for everyday use? I‚Äôd be grateful if you have recommendations for suppliers of food grade distilled water, especially if they‚Äôll allow me to use refillable containers.

I know that Aquafina water used to measure close to 0 TDS but I think for various reasons that brands like these with very low TDS have changed their compositions to fit the range 50-150 ppm.

Update to the post below. 

I had my surgery on May 20th. I won‚Äôt lie, the week-2weeks after sucked for me. I couldn‚Äôt swallow anything. Even water was a struggle. My wedding was this summer so the only perk is that I lost 10 pounds very fast lol 
After the first 2 weeks, I could eat yogurt and protein shakes. 

I was able to start eating real food about a month after but it was a very slow process.


My first meal where I could eat without ‚Äúwashing‚Äù each bite down with water‚Ä¶ was two weeks ago lol. And even sometimes I still have to take a sip between bites. It‚Äôs encouraged me to slow down and up my water intake but basically I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt plan a fun food tour for a while post op.

Now the good stuff- I can burp like a champ. Multiple times a day. Deep ones too. They feel like they come from my toes LOL. If this procedure ever failed me, 1000% I would go back and do it again. Even though my recovery sucked. 

Life is so great now and I love fizzy drinks. I broke up with my heating pad that I used to use every night at 7pm onwards for my bloating/abdominal discomfort.

Botox completed yesterday with BVI (Hoesli)

Hi!! 
I had my Botox done yesterday in Chicago with Dr Hoesli. Firstly, what a fricken angel. She is the most kind, personable Dr I have ever had the privilege of meeting. 

The nasal scope truly isn‚Äôt horrible as long as you calm down. I have anxiety and I did amazing. In fact, it‚Äôs super neat to learn deeper into your anatomy. 

I spoke with her about doing 100 units vs the typical 75 as I am from Canada and our dollar sucks right now lol so I wanted to decrease the chances of failure. So she agreed after explaining the increased side effects (slow swallow etc) 

My surgery went well! I believe she mentioned my esophageal anatomy being thick? And so I woke up with a sore throat that I wasn‚Äôt super prepared for lol I would say worse than a cold that others have mentioned here. However, 5/6 hours post op, it was manageable and I was talking the rest of the 8 hour drive home. 

Zero throat discomfort today! I was drinking some coffee and had my first burp!! I cried. So I started chugging Coke lol annnd burped more. I am so pumped, however, very full and bloated now so maybe don‚Äôt get over excited like I was and chug pop right after your first burp lol. I also have gurgles now. I would say these burps are bigger than micro but smaller than a true belch.

The topic came to mind so I‚Äôm just letting it out. I‚Äôm a girl in my mid 20s and found out a couple years ago that I‚Äôm ace. When I reflected on if I had ever experienced sexual attraction it was partly inspired by being the only girl in my high school friend group to not be dating, have a crush, or having/wanting sex. We all started to grow apart but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that me not expressing an interest in boys (bc to my knowledge at the time they were all straight) partially contributed to me becoming an outsider in the group. Like they‚Äôd go on double dates and few had ditched the group to eat at the place where their crush was going to be not inviting the rest of us and I didn‚Äôt get why‚Ä¶ including some of them having sex in their car. It sounds terrible but I didn‚Äôt understand what to ask to I guess show support for my friends dating and regarding sex I didn‚Äôt want to hear about it in detail.

Most of my close friends now are guys. (Obviously not attracted to them and only one knows I‚Äôm asexual. Funny enough told him the first time we met.) It kinda just ended up that way. And it‚Äôs interesting bc only one of them talks about sex with me and he appreciates it bc he can‚Äôt openly talk about it with his other friends. (Now I recognize that I‚Äôm comfortable hearing about it but not in too much detail. I guess just as a concept or idea idk.)
The one girl I thought might be my girl friend forever, I told her to block a guy that was being dumb. (She gave hints and finally asked him to grab coffee to get to know each other more and he said what do you mean. I thought that was a fucking stupid response.) I essentially told her to not waste her time on him, but she I guess had a big crush on him that I didn‚Äôt understand bc she doesn‚Äôt show her emotions. Soon after including it being not the healthiest of friendships we stopped talking to each other. I think she wanted like a ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs girl‚Äù type of friend who would encourage her to keep pursuing, but I guess I don‚Äôt display that well. 

I‚Äôm not the best at texting, so I‚Äôm not the best at maintaining friends. I‚Äôm trying to do better. It seems like my current friends don‚Äôt mind me randomly hitting them up out of the blue to check in and see what they‚Äôre up to. I just sometimes worry about making and maintaining friends who are girls because I‚Äôm not into dating and having sex despite being open to support their experiences. (I think I have a better idea now of what I should be asking/saying.) I just think (allo) girls get excited to talk about such topics, but not me bc I have nothing to talk about.

And I am fully over any thoughts of him but more stuck on how awful I was to him for no reason even though my friends think I‚Äôm overthinking. 

He initially dm‚Äôd me 3yrs ago saying he never really does this but thought I was beautiful and loved my work (I have a public business profile) and would love to get to know me. I (27F - at the time 24F) had never really had a serious relationship and mostly am a man hater and like to pour into myself, my female friendships and my work unless someone worth my time approaches me. Am someone who is content in being single. 

I didn‚Äôt reply but requested to follow/accepted to see his account. He seemed decent. I then forgot about the dm. He then swiped up on some of my stories which is when I finally replied to his dm saying I appreciated how upfront he was from the get go rather than beating around the bush with silly dms etc. but I am not really one to get to know people online and prefer irl. He said okay I understand and jokingly ‚ÄúI now have to stage a run in at a coffee shop‚Äù to which I said if we ever naturally run into each other I‚Äôd happily grab a coffee. (1st rejection I guess)

A couple months later he replied to my story wishing me happy holidays and we started having friendly conversation. It was nice, nothing extraordinary but normal nice friendly conversation. But I‚Äôm horrible at texting and busy so I‚Äôd barely reply properly and admit he was carrying the conversation. He then suggested we do a phone call (1-2ish weeks into texting) which I said no to. 2 days later I found myself struggling to keep up with texting and suggested a phone call to which he agreed to same evening. We spoke for an hour. It was okay, not bad, we could be friends, again friendly banter but I realised we come from very different backgrounds (I have strict ethnic parents who would never stand for that) he was also overly sarcastic which I found annoying. He made a few sarcastic ‚Äújokes‚Äù that didn‚Äôt land well with me. (In hindsight I was also afraid of any commitment at the time) The next day I opened my chat with him, his last message was an apology for not texting me right after the call and asking to move the convo out of insta. I replied to this message with it was nice getting to know him but I don‚Äôt see this progressing past friendship. He tried to suggest a meet up irl to see the vibes irl saying first calls can be awkward but he thought it went well but I was insistent and said I didn‚Äôt feel anything on the call and removed him from my insta. (2nd rejection) atp my reasoning in my head was his family background + his height (I am quite tall) 

2 years later he dmd me out of the blue asking if I was still single (jokingly). I had been thinking about how dismissive ?? I was to him so decided to reply. We got talking again and he asked me to remind him how many siblings I have again. This pissed me off!! Like if you don‚Äôt remember, just scroll up ?? Was he trying to be non chalant?? To this I replied ‚ÄúBE SO FOR REAL RN‚Äù in response to which he started calling my phone (he clearly still had my number saved). I didn‚Äôt pick up. I suggested a meet up. I told him I am bad at texting and it caused misunderstanding. I run a busy business and don‚Äôt have time to waste. He said sure but he was going away so it would be after he was back and I said fine but until then let‚Äôs not text. Suddenly he said he‚Äôd carve out time the day before his trip to meet me (2 days from the text). I was taken aback but asked where he‚Äôd like to meet. We live around 3hrs away from each other, he suggested a city in the middle. But north of the city which is much closer to him and it was mini golf which is sort of dating hot spot for young school couples ??? Which gave me the ick because me and my girlfriends dine in the nicest of places for a casual catch up..I suggested the north of the city was too far for me, can we do east of the city and he said travelling from north to east is so far, he might as well drive to another city‚Ä¶ bearing in mind I was coming from another city. That made me quite angry and was a clear sign that this man wasn‚Äôt for me. Especially in my culture, men are expected to court women from the get go. This was giving low effort. My mistake was, I wasn‚Äôt immediately transparent with him and instead said I‚Äôd check my schedule and see if I can make it and let you know. He then replied actually let‚Äôs just meet when I‚Äôm back, it‚Äôll be much easier. I then sat on my thoughts for a day and sent him a long message saying my initial thoughts were right (2yrs ago) and I don‚Äôt think this will work. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with him, we just won‚Äôt be a good match. To which he replied saying it‚Äôs my decision but he feels I never gave him a real chance or ‚Äúprove his value‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt standing by my word of how texting isn‚Äôt great to get to know people and we should meet. I removed him from my profile immediately. (3rd rejection)

A few days later he sent me a video from a wedding he was attending during his holiday of the decor and music ??? I found this so odd. He wasn‚Äôt even in it, it was just the camera panning with a sad song playing in bg??? What did this mean? Upon seeing this I blocked him. 

Anyway all this to say, was I mean to him or am I just overthinking because I don‚Äôt give many men a chance / speak to many men?

1mv2sxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CIRS/comments/1mv2sxc/my_advice_based_on_my_experience/,My advice based on my experience,"Since my last post its become abundantly clear everyone here is battered and stressed and want some proper guidance. Figured I'd do my best to help and let people know the details of how I clawed my way out of cirs. 

In terms of treatment the soild ground work i laid comes back to my new home it was built in 2024 and is on a flat slab with no crawlspaces this is key because the construction and design determines how the house will fair over the years it stays standing. Property built on a flat slab is harder to turn moldy because water cannot get under the house and into the floor, I also keep air circulation via open windows and a few fans going on low to make sure air exchange occurs everyday. 

In terms of csm I used a compounded form with no additives and I paired that with coffee enemas and alpha lipoc acid because it helps clear the liver and bile ducts this is key to detox. If the ducts are clogged up and bile isn't flowing detox will take forever or perhaps not even occur at all. Get a coffee thats toxin tested and safe dont buy shit off the shelf at the supermarkets. Also get a cheap enema kit off ebay mine was 30 aud. Do them once or twice a week while taking 3g of csm twice a day. Also stay home as much as possible and order your stuff online or have a friend or family member act on your behalf stay out of public buildings or if you must use a P2 mask and be quick you dont want to hang around in suspicious buildings you know nothing about while u are sick. 

A few other key bits of information and things i did that worked well...

I went full carnivour just meat and eggs cooked all food at home in animal fat and only drank water with Celtic salt in it, this helped massively and is very safe but unpleasant for the first couple weeks as the body falls into ketosis and detoxes from sugar addiction and the other crap in our food system. 

I used alot of basic supplements here's my list. 

1. Methylated b vitamin complex
2. High dose fish oil 2000mg per capsule 
3. L-glutamine powder mixed in water for gut health 
4. Alpha lipoc acid to clear the liver along side coffee enemas, this makes csm work better due to clearing the pipes so to speak.
5. Magnesium citrate and glycinate for bowel movements and muscle relaxation
6. Celtic salt its full of minerals and keeps you hydrated when mixed in water 
7. Sleep teas for aiding sleep. I used a mix and variety of teas to knock me out for sleep I still had a night here or there where I was dealing with insomnia but for the most part I'd make the tea so strong is was like a sedative. Anything with lemon grass and camomile works well.


MARCONS. 
I never had a issue with this but collidial silver plus EDTA is the goto no body uses BEG spray much anymore due to the increasing resistance from the bacteria. The edta breaks the biofilm and the silver kills it. May take weeks for some people or months for others. All depends on the state of your immune system. 

VIP (VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL PEPTIDE) 
this is a 26 amino acid neuro polypeptide from the glucagon secretin super family and is produced naturally in the body of humans and other mammals. Its found in the brain and various organs and its effects are multifaceted. It also regulates alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone, when you get sick with cirs VIP and MSH drop to undetectable levels and this causes a massive downstream cascade of dysregulation in the body. 

VIP therapy is done once you complete the following. 

1. Move to a clean house 
2. Detox with CSM 
3. Clear marcons

Once thats all done along with lifestyle changes like diet and using supportive supplements along the way over a few months vip can be started. I used 20mcg a day to start to make sure I didn't react. Once that was established I moved quite fast to 40mcg then 60mcg and now 100mcg a day and I'll be going as high as 400mcg a day. This is to reverse the epigenetic changes caused by cirs. This in turn gives me back my tolerance so I can be in borderline dodgy environments again and dont have to live under a rock the rest of my life. Most people can achieve this to varying degrees depending on your HLA gene. I have a mold only gene so I'm lucky, other people that are multi susceptible are harder to get to this stage but it can be done. 

A few other notes about my journey...

I never really used cirs doctors I did 90% of this myself all I really had consistently was a regular GP to give me the scripts each month. 

Everything i took that required a script was compounded and my supplements came from my local health shop. 

I lived in mold for just over a year before I could move and start treatment this was key as acting fast improved my rate of healing. Others that have longer term exposure also have more damage which means healing takes longer but if you stick to it you will get results. The house I came from was a hertsmi-2 of 30 thats 3 times the cut off, the house im in now is a hertsmi-2 of 2. 

I hope all this helps I know its hard and its bullshit that this happens to people but remember the immune system is built off the back of millions of years of evolution and natural selection, just because your body doesn't do well with fungus doesn't mean it's broken. The immune system makes a trade off, you trade off the ability to deal with fungus for the ability to fight off other pathogens better than most that have been issues in the past for alot of us. Cirs is a new situation because mankind didn't always own houses like we did today thus making our run ins with mold rare for most of our existence. There is more studies and emerging recognition in the medical world about cirs than ever before and this silent epidemic will be uncovered in due course. 

Best regards be safe and get well.

1mv2sgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1mv2sgo/heres_how_we_cut_our_geocoding_costs_by_90/,Here's how we cut our geocoding costs by 90%,"Have you experienced sticker shock from your Google Maps Platform billing recently? I reviewed our startup's AWS costs during the previous month until I almost inhaled my [coffee.Google](http://coffee.Google) Maps APIs: **$4,847**. For a pre-revenue product with 50K MAU. The total cost of address autocomplete and geocoding services adds up quickly.I solved this problem by following these steps to preserve user experience.

**Google maps pricing hits real**

We need to perform a fast calculation of Google's current pricing structure.

**Address Autocomplete (Places API)**:

The pricing structure for this service costs $2.83 for every 1,000 requests (session-based).

* Average user triggers 8-12 autocomplete requests per search
* Cost per completed address: \~$0.025

**Geocoding API**:

* $5.00 per 1K requests
* Every form submission needs lat/lng conversion The cost per geocode is $0.005.

**For a growing app with 50K MAU**:

The monthly address search volume of 200K would cost $5,000.

The monthly cost for 150K geocoding requests would be $750.

The total monthly cost amounts to $5,750.

**The search for alternatives**

I evaluated several options:

**MapBox**

* the cost is slightly lower than $3K+/month at our scale.
* The API design follows good practices and maintains similar integration complexity.
* The verdict is better, but nothing out of this world.

**OpenStreetMap + Nominatim**

* Free to use, self-hosted option available
* The data quality produces irregular results particularly for address information.
* The verdict is that it is great for hobby projects but risky for production.

**Here Maps**

The company does not provide enterprise-focused pricing because it does not offer quotes for our volume.

* **Verdict**: Nope

**Radar**

* $0.50 per 1K requests across all APIs The system maintains the same accuracy level as Google does when processing US address information.
* **Verdict**: 90% cost reduction

**Comparison**

Here's the before/after for address autocomplete:

**Google Places Autocomplete approach**: The system needs two distinct API requests to perform autocomplete suggestions and geocoding coordinate operations.The pricing model of session-based pricing charges users for each keystroke they make and requires extra API requests to obtain full location information.

**Radar Search Autocomplete approach**: Single API call returns formatted addresses with coordinates [included.No](http://included.no/) session-based pricing means you only pay for completed searches, not user interactions.The integration process becomes simple because it automatically includes coordinate information.

**The real world data results**

**Before (Google Maps)**:

* The monthly cost of this plan amounts to $4,847.
* The integration process needed two days to finish because it included both session token management and billing configuration.
* The geocoding process needs additional steps for most applications.

**After (Radar)**:

* Monthly cost: $487 ‚Äî 90% reduction!
* The integration period will last for 4 hours.
* The coordinates are already included in the API request so no additional API calls are required.

**Some tips**

**1.Debouncing is Critical** API requests should not be sent with each individual keystroke.The system needs a 300ms delay to start the request after the user stops typing. The method reduces API requests while maintaining user experience responsiveness.

**2.Cache Common Searches** The system needs to establish fundamental in-memory caching to enhance the speed of repeated address searches.The same popular locations are searched by numerous users which enables caching to decrease API usage by 30-40%.

**3. Graceful Fallbacks** Always have a backup plan if your primary geocoding service fails. The system needs to have a backup plan to switch to another provider or at least have a smooth error handling process to keep the user experience.

**Gotchas and Limitations**

The radar system provides excellent address detection throughout the United States and Canada but its international coverage is limited.If you need global coverage, you might need a hybrid approach.

The data freshness of this platform is lower than Google because new developments take longer to appear.For most use cases this isn't an issue, but worth knowing.

The free tier allows 100K requests per month before the rate costs $0.50 for every 1K request.The free tier provides much more generous usage than Google's free tier.

Organizations can reduce costs through Google Maps alternative adoption for US-focused applications without affecting user experience. Here's our ROI.

* **Annual savings**: $52,320
* The entire project duration amounts to 4 hours.
* The system's performance remains unaffected by this change (in fact, it becomes slightly faster).
* The engineering team happiness at 100% (no more budget alerts).

It wasn‚Äôt just about money. It was about how I wanted to live, the kind of people I wanted around me, and the way I wanted to feel in a relationship.

I‚Äôm an Indian woman in my 20s, and like a lot of us, I grew up with pressure around studies, career, marriage, and being the ‚Äúperfect daughter.‚Äù But when I moved to a bigger city for work and studies, I saw a different world. A world where men with influence, money, and experience were openly dating younger women. Some called it sugar dating, and I was curious.

At first, I thought, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this just like escorting or being a call girl?‚Äù But the more I explored, the clearer it became: it‚Äôs not the same. And for me personally, the difference was big enough to shape my decision.

[be a sugar baby](https://preview.redd.it/e3ui7f1o53kf1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9ecc7cfd5a327e6c1e4c151f93b343636cb55e8)

**Why I Chose to Be a Sugar Baby**

1. **I wanted real connection, not just transactions** When I thought about being a call girl, it felt very one-time, very rushed. You meet a guy, you do what he wants, you take the money, and you leave. That didn‚Äôt sit right with me. I wanted something slower, more natural. As a sugar baby, I actually get to know my sugar daddy. We talk, we travel, we laugh, sometimes we even fight. It feels more like a relationship, even if it‚Äôs unconventional.
2. **Respect matters to me** I didn‚Äôt want to be treated like a product. I wanted to be treated like a person. Sugar daddies, at least the genuine ones, see you as their partner, not just a service. My sugar daddy values my opinions, invests in my growth, and respects my boundaries. With escorting, I feel like that line is blurred‚Äîyou‚Äôre there to please, not to be respected.
3. **Safety and choice** Let‚Äôs be real: safety is a huge factor. In escorting, you often don‚Äôt get to choose who the client is. But as a sugar baby, I can say yes or no. I pick my sugar daddy after chatting, meeting for coffee, and checking vibes. I feel safer because I have that control.
4. **Lifestyle over cash** Of course, money is part of sugar dating. But it‚Äôs not just cash in an envelope. My sugar daddy supports my studies, helps with travel, gifts me experiences I‚Äôd never afford otherwise. It‚Äôs not just about survival money‚Äîit‚Äôs about upgrading my life. That‚Äôs something escorting could never give me long-term.

**My First Experience**

I‚Äôll never forget the first time I met a sugar daddy offline. We connected online first. He was in his late 40s, a businessman, very straightforward. Instead of talking dirty or pushing me, he asked about my goals and why I was interested in sugar dating. That conversation alone made me realize I was in the right space.

When we finally met, it was at a five-star hotel lounge, not some shady room. He was respectful, charming, and surprisingly funny. He told me clearly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for a call girl. I want someone I can trust, travel with, and spoil.‚Äù That‚Äôs when it clicked‚ÄîI‚Äôm not selling myself; I‚Äôm sharing myself, with limits I set.

# Why Not a Call Girl?

* **Short-term vs. long-term**: [Call girls](https://www.sugardaddymeet.com/call-girls) may earn quickly, but it‚Äôs unstable. With sugar dating, I have ongoing support.
* **Emotional comfort**: I don‚Äôt feel empty after meeting my sugar daddy. With call work, I imagine I‚Äôd feel disconnected.
* **Social image**: In India, both are taboo, but honestly, it feels different to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with an older man who supports me,‚Äù versus ‚ÄúI sleep with men for cash.‚Äù Maybe society won‚Äôt see the difference, but *I* do, and that matters.
* **Personal growth**: My sugar daddy mentors me in business, teaches me things I‚Äôd never learn otherwise. I doubt I‚Äôd get that if I was just selling nights.

**Things I Learned Along the Way**

1. **Be clear about your boundaries** ‚Äì Sugar dating isn‚Äôt about saying yes to everything. Decide what you‚Äôre okay with.
2. **Choose carefully** ‚Äì Not every man calling himself a sugar daddy is genuine. Some just want cheap thrills.
3. **Respect yourself first** ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt, no sugar daddy will.
4. **Don‚Äôt confuse it with love** ‚Äì Sugar dating can feel like a relationship, but it‚Äôs not always forever. Enjoy it, but stay realistic.
5. **Privacy is everything** ‚Äì Be smart about what you share online and offline.

# Final Thoughts

I became a sugar baby, not a call girl, because I wanted more than money. I wanted respect, mentorship, and a lifestyle upgrade. I wanted a man who valued me as a person, not a product. And honestly, sugar dating gave me that balance.

It may not be everyone‚Äôs path, but for me, it was the right choice. Being a sugar baby allows me to grow, to enjoy life, and to do it on my terms. That‚Äôs why I say proudly: *I chose to be a sugar baby, not a call girl.*",1,1755657060.0,sugarbabydaddyindia,2,0.67,False

I am a 34 male/gender queer person. I have known the guy that I am currently dating for the past few years. We live in the same city and we followed each other on IG about 3 years ago cause we have a few mutual friends. We had never met in person and I had a thing for him but I knew that at the time he was in a relationship. I messaged him when we first followed each other saying that he was cute and that we should go for a coffee but it never materialised.

Cut to a few months ago, he started posting more pics of himself and I thought that he probably broke up with his boyfriend. I got the suss from a mutual friend of ours and to my excitement, he was single. I messaged him again to meet for a coffee but it didn't materialise again. 

3 months ago, I was cycling home and at some point I heard my name shouted at me. I looked back and it was him. I went back and we chatted for the first time. There were definitely sparks and I would define it as a meet cute. We were standing at a bridge, during the sunset and kept smiling and chatting to each other. 

We then ended up going on a date, that was amazing. Since that date we have seen each other about 6 times, all times very hot and fun. He is very busy with work and after our first date he said that he is ""famously unreliable"". He is not very responsive to my messages but I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his work.

The one thing that is kinda freaking me out though is the fact that he keeps adding me and removing me from his close friends on IG. I know that he is doing that because he has saved one of his close friends' stories in his highlights, and sometimes I can see it and sometimes I can't. He seems to be quite into the curation of his Instagram stories and the fact that he is always thinking of adding me and removing me freaks me out a bit.

I know that we are basically only starting to see each other now but we have said that we really enjoy our time with each other. He is flaky with me but when we are together, it feels great. Am I overthinking this?? Should I say something to him about it? Or is this relationship doomed?

TL;DR: is it a red flag that the guy that I started dating 3 months ago keeps adding me and removing me from his close friends on Instagram?

Anyone been on Treasure that can confirm?

I went on a long trip for 2 weeks, and i have just gotten home. I had 2 flights either direction, one 3 hour flight and one 9 hour flight, so a LONG FLIGHT, I was very anxious and worked up both ways. I was traveling with my grandmother (former nurse) with her own health issues, so I had a lot of understanding and support from her as I wore my apple watch to track my heart rate, so I showed her my watch for a comparison to her hr. Obviously, mine was unreasonably high all the time (resting usually 80-110, standing immediately 135-160). One direction I thought I would be okay without wheelchair assist, but that was not the move, having to chase this dude in CIRCLES running with my grandma was not it. I had wheelchair assist on my way back, definitely needed it.

Getting into the purpose of this post, I just wanted to discuss my experience with this because I feel very crappy right now. I know that air travel and pots are not friends, and I am trying to rest and drink as much water as possible to recover. If you have any experiences to share or suggestions on how to best deal with this feel free to comment!

During the flights, other than my anxiety (and probably nicotine withdrawals tbh), I felt kind of okay during the flight, just anxious and slightly nauseous (which is one of my main symptoms) and my body hurting pretty bad. I wore compression socks and tight-ish biker shorts, I took my zofran for nausea throughout the flights, I tried to drink a lot of electrolytes before hand (probably didn‚Äôt have enough, I think I had 1 or 2 packets of 1000 mg), I kept a few puke bags with me, and I watched movies to try to keep myself calm. I had a few moments that felt like kind of hot flashes, but they kind of went away, it also may have actually been hot, not sure. I also cannot sleep in that position at all, so I was pretty tired. Either way, I was very glad to not faint or puke, and I was able to eat on the flight.

After landing there, I felt very nauseous and exhausted with a constantly racing heart for 2 whole days, even hitting 190 as I brushed my teeth (currently this is my first day home, I have been too exhausted to charge my watch, but I can feel my heart racing), my zofran was hardly helping, so I was hardly eating (I was reunited with nicotine as well, so it was not that). After 2 days we had to drive a short distance to our main location for the trip, and my nausea finally subsided. I thought maybe I was anxious to get to the main spot? But, I feel very crap today, I have had a mild to constant sensation of needing to pee but nothing come out, I went to sleep shortly after I got home, but one of my neighbors somehow burnt eggs bad enough for the fire department to come at 10 pm, so I had to get out of bed and walk down stairs and outside, which was really dope, so I did not sleep well. I woke up at 7 am unable to fall back asleep. I also deal with HEDS so all my joints and back and neck and hips are killing me today. I feel very crappy if I am sitting upright, my heart races (again not sure how much). I was a bit nauseous earlier, but I took my zofran and have been laying down for a few hours, and I feel much better that way. I feel very exhausted, but unable to sleep because my heart feels like its trying to give me a panic attack.

I have been drinking water and coffee (I have found it to regulate my hr more) and I have been laying down, but this sucks!!! Thanks for reading! Again if you have any advice or experiences to share, please share!",1,1755656580.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

She really liked our convo as we chatted and wanted to catch up again and gave me her number yesterday.

I texted her today.

I‚Äôd like to make friends as im new to this small  city but also scared because i have trust issues with people and their fake smiles and customer service presentations.

I hate always doing everything alone for over half a decade. Now like I do want at least just 1 friend just 1.

Idk, im also asking redditors who are equally as glued to their phones and lack social skills.

How do you become friends with someone,as in a stranger? Do you text people slowly or just dive in for a coffee chat?",2,1755656500.0,Productivitycafe,4,1.0,False
1mv2i4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceNZ/comments/1mv2i4r/property_manager_wants_me_to_pay_for_sink/,Property manager wants me to pay for sink replacement,"Over a month ago I accidentally knocked a shelf in the bathroom while drying off after a shower. A candle on it fell into the ceramic sink underneath and cracked it.

I told the property manager straight away.

They came back saying ""As this is tenant damage the cost will be payable by yourselves"".

I asked if the owner had insurance and made it clear it wasn't intentional.

Since then:

* It's been over a month and the sink is still broken.
* The first quote was in 20 days ago (they got multiple), and was the one they ended up going with.
* The property owner approved a plumbers quote, but I was never told the cost, other than it was less than the insurance so it would be paid directly by invoice.
* I've been told the plumber will be in touch, and when the invoice comes I'll have to pay it (or go on a payment plan)

This feels off because:

* I never got to see or agree to the quote before they locked it in.
* My understanding is tenants are only liable for *careless* damage, capped at 4 weeks rent or the insurance excess, whichever is lower. And tenants aren't liable for genuine accidents.
* Landlords still have to keep the place in repair, and we have had no working bathroom sink for over a month. (But still knowing we have to still leave reasonable time for repair, though the original plumber mentioned the moment the quote was accepted the fixtures could be ordered and installed within the next week)
* I‚Äôve never been given any insurance info for this tenancy.

It feels like the property manager has just skipped forward and decided tenant pays no matter what.

We've been in this place for over a decade and is the first time needing to deal with this kind of thing.

It isn't about the amount either, if I even knew what it was, it sounds like the amount isn't going to be high (given the amount is less than the excess for insurance), but it feels off.

I was reading through this page here and it really does seem careless damage doesn't include going about normal life and something accidentally happens.

[https://tenant.aratohu.nz/repairs/careless-damage](https://tenant.aratohu.nz/repairs/careless-damage)

>The Tenancy Tribunal has said that these things were accidental damage, and the tenant was not liable:

>A tenant was using a blender stick when it fell out of her hands and damaged a stone benchtop. (Tenancy Tribunal Order 4272505, 4272034)¬†

>A tenant dropped a coffee cup onto a glass ceramic cooktop and cracked it. Tenancy Tribunal Order 4261406.

I could totally see if I had been throwing the candle around the room and it slipped out of my hand into the sink, but I was going about normal bathroom things, there had been a shelf there for a good amount of time, along with other things prior hanging off the same hook that we didn't place there.

Other details, we do have a tenancy agreement, it is on the older side now and we haven't had any updates to it other than allowing a dog on the property many years ago. Pretty standard tenancy otherwise. Bond was upped maybe 5 years ago.",2,1755656412.0,LegalAdviceNZ,23,0.58,False
1mv2hf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mv2hf7,Cabinet Hardware advise needed,"Cabinet hardware advice requested. 

I recently moved into a new place and the kitchen is the orignal one from 1975 and I want to do a refresh before I fully unpack the kitchen since the insides of all drawers and cabinets is in pretty poor condition cosmetically given its 50 years old and original but seems solid and is solid wood construction. Original idea was to only paint the cabinets but scope has grown now that I have started stripping down and painting.

I started with the upper cabinets by removing the doors and doing some sanding to flat out some uneven spots and transitions, caulking any gaps inside the cabinets and painting with Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee (very similar to original colour), now that I have started getting into it I am thinking that since I am removing the hardware to paint all surfaces (cabinets and doors) I can just as well fill all surfaces and holes and add new hardware (hinges and handles) to give it a more modern look but keeping the original kitchen style.

The doors are 3/8"" rebatted doors. 

I am looking for recommendations for new handles and hinges to use. What type of style would go well with this kitchen design ? Ideally soft close hinges would be preffered but seems options are none with the rebatted doors.
