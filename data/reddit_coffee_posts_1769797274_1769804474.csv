I recently started getting into making my own espresso at home about a month ago. I use the Chefman Barista Pro as of now. 

But, recently bought a bottomless portafilter, to understand and diagnose my espresso shots better. However, I keep getting this result. Where it is coming out really fast, and spraying all over the place. I buy preground coffee, Cafe La Llave, and for this dose I did 18g. 

I also use tools to help with clumping and a tamper that you just push down on. I also am just wondering does my machine not work with a bottomless portafilter? Any help is appreciated thank you.",1,1769803722.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1qrgf8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1qrgf8e/insights_of_a_uk_grad_working_in_germany_f1_and/,Insights of a UK Grad working in Germany | F1 and Flee Story 🇩🇪,"Hi All, 
About a Year ago I did a long post about moving to Germany from the UK. I want to do a follow up to that post as I have worked for 1 month now as a Urology Resident in Germany. It is also a good reflection for me and hopefully a eye opener for whoever may be interested in reading this.  I have written this as a scramble of different points apologies for my SPAG in advance.

Caveats: My Experiences are limited to only what I have seen and heard. I don’t speak for the German healthcare system. r/Medizin is a better place to go to gain further insights. Opinions are my own. 


Why Move to Germany (My motivations)
- In the latter years of medical School I had the feeling that the situation was not getting better in the UK regarding training. I started in my Final year and F1 to learn German. 
- I have a few family and friend connection in Germany by virtue of Family members living there for a number of years
- I wanted the flexibility of picking a speciality I WANTED to do and not because some dumb test determines my future
- I completed F1 and did a runner to Germany


Getting Medical License in Germany (Approbation)
- Took exactly 300 days from the point of applying to getting my Medical Licence
- I had to sit in total 2 Exams – B2 exam and a medical Language Exam 
- Germany for those that don’t know runs via a federal system. Every Bundesland (Federal state) has there own rules and there own Medical Regulator
- There is a very tough exam known as the KP, thankfully if a UK grad applies to Berlin, NRW, Baden-Württemberg one does not have to sit that Exam. UK grads are treated as EU grads. However this may not be the case from other Federal states. Hamburg sees the UK as not EU equivalent. 


Finances on Relocation
- Had to fork out around 2-3K in Pounds on Translation of documents, Apostille, German Bureaucracy, Visa, Exams, Approbation Application etc. 
- I worked in Med Tech for 1 Year in a small start up while I did the German exams, learnt German further and did a few 1 week Internships in different hospitals in Berlin. That kept me afloat while in Berlin in my F2 equivalent year.


Getting into a speciality
- Someone recently asked this in the German Medicine subreddit so I wont repeat it. https://www.reddit.com/r/medizin/comments/1qgblnv/ist\_dieses\_wettbewerbsranking\_noch\_aktuell\_2026/
- In end effect. There is no training programmes here. You complete a set number of years (Speciality dependent) and then sit an exit exam and then you have your CCT. 
- What determines getting a job. Location (Berlin is more competitive then a village in with 10,000 people). Time of year (Tends to be more hiring around March-Sept), Connections (If you know someone and there is funding in the department a vacancy can be created for you), German (the better your German is, the more likely you will impress the Head of the Department to hire you) – Remember one is also Applying for a Job against Locals + Locals that studied in Europe, if you sound like your GCSE German speaking Exam, im afraid that doesn’t cut it.
- I applied for hospitals in and around Berlin Initially, didn’t have any luck (But also applied in Nov / Dec – where budgets are closed for the year) and then found a Job in a Village near Münster – So I relocated. Urology as a speciality is on the competitive side.


German in the workplace
- Obviously as a doctor there are lot of interactions Doc – Doc, Doc – Pat, Doc – MDT etc. 
- Passing C1 or B2 normal GOETHE / Telc exam does not anywhere prepare you for working in the hospital environment. The pace is so quick, the vocab very nuanced. Despite being able to hold a general conversation with any German speaker on about any topic, when one is in the hospital environment its another level. Being only 1 month in I would say I have not 100% settled where I want to be.
- I remember working as a F1 and thinking I need to call radiology to get a CT vetted ASAP, one naturally prepares everything you would say to convince the Doctor on the other end of the Phone. Now imagine doing that in a language you have learnt. Its really tough! 
- Patient – Doc , Patient Relative – Doc interactions are probably the easiest to both understand and undertake


Computer System and Paperwork in the Hospital
-	Sigh, Switzerland has lots of Hospitals which have bought EPIC. If anybody wants a list of those hospitals there is a user who is “Not an epic employee” that sometimes pops up in the Sub
-	Germany only 1 Hospital has Epic – Charite Berlin (They have recently bought it) 
-	Cerner doesn’t really exist here from my limited knowledge
-	The computer systems which do exist; Orbis, ImedOne, SAP/Oracle, CGM – I don’t think they are very good and are very clunky with slow interfaces from what I have seen 
-	Whats more is that there is a lot of paperwork. Some hospitals still use a Fax machine. There is a lot of paperwork which has not been fully digitalised yet. Overall I would think that this is a department that Germany is behind the UK in.
-	One is lucky if you get a hospital with Ipads where you can access the patient data or COWs to do mobile ward rounds.


Nurses
- Having worked in both Systems I feel this is quite similar. There is the culture of “I told the doctor – I am now safe” in both systems.
- In my hospital the SECRETARY takes the bloods (which I think is an exception) and the nurses put Catheters in. 
- Each Doctor has their own portable phone within the Hospital, there does seem to be a culture of just ringing constantly until one gets through to someone.
- I feel German Hospital Culture and NHS culture are quite similar in the sense that one could be told off for doing something you aren’t meant to do even if its very small

Daily Work as a Urology Resident
0. Get to hospital 10 – 20 mins before and print handover sheet and get changed
1.  Morning Early team meeting 7am – go over all patients and operations for the day -The Consultants basically say what will happen to the patients before the ward round takes place. If there is an anomaly one lets the consultant know or uses ones own clinical accument
2a. Ward round – for more junior residents
2b. Direct to surgery for more senior residents and consultants
3. Coffee and Small break
4a. Consenting patients for Surgery – This is done by the residents in Germany and not by the Regs or Consultants. Basically the patients may be sent from the GP, Ambulant Praxis Urologist, Or were once admitted and then discharged (known to the hospital). Consenting patients consists of History, Examination, Ultrasound and paperwork.
 4b. As a junior one would pop in and out of Surgery while doing the consenting, on a good day that’s 4-5 operations. On a bad day, that’s no operating. It can vary based on staffing levels, Theatre capacity and demand
4c. One could also get calls for Ward tasks in this time
5. Lunch – Consultant Coffee doesn’t exist here ☹ 
6. Afternoon team meeting 1pm – Go over ward patients, Go over how all the Operations went, Go over all consented patients for surgery, talk about tomorrows Operations. 
7. Discharge summaries, Further ward work, Operations if one is planned in
8. Home at 3:00-4:00pm
- Hospitals basically have a mix up of these 4-5 things in different proportions; Consenting patients, Operating, Ward work, ED cover, Biopsies.  
- Fridays I finish at 1:30 which is also nice


On calls
- I would like to introduce the 24h shift system. Doctors here can work basically 24hours. Monday 8am start till Tuesday 8am. Back to work on Wednesday. In my hospital thats around 4-5 a month. In my hospital I cover only urology. In other hospitals the Urology residents could also be on the Gen surg rota and even god forbid the Ortho rota. Urology residents doing casts does exist.
- Every hospital has a different format for how they do this some are 24 hours, some 16 hours, some 20 hour
- The On call person often will cover the ED independently as well as any emergency surgeries with a appointed consultant and helping with points 4-5 if needed.


Quality of Training
- I find my team and Leadership great. I think the department is excellent and I was fortunate enough to get theatre time on my second day.
-I also see from my more senior residents that they are confident doing a lot of operations independently having stayed in the hospital for 4-5 years. 
- Sadly the situation in Germany is such if you land in a bad department you learn the procedures very late 3 – 5th resident year. And you would basically be a ward/paperwork monkey until then.
-There are many stories of people completing residency and they don’t even know how to remove a gall bladder or do a circumcision confidently.


Pay
A simple google search will reveal this. Please also bare in mind that Tax in Germany is higher than the UK and there are 4 Different tax groups. But I feel the quality of living in Germany is slightly lower than the UK.
Rent culture and Rent protection also means rents here are lower compared to the UK - https://www.immobilienscout24.de/
Doctors easily live a good upper middle class lifestyle with yearly / biyearly pay progression. 

So far there are 5 UK grads actively working in Germany and we are all in a whatsapp group together. Feel free to ask to join if interested.

Recently on my shifts he constantly started disappearing either toilet or bring one big bag to the bin or somewhere god knows where I let it go up until he decided that he will clock out of shift and leave out back without a word or finishing the end of day cleaning. Spoke to manager he said to her he will start respecting me when I respect him apparently I talked to much in my own language to colleague and customers which I took well and understood and even apologised. Even though he did the same to a colleague that spoke his language a while back until that person left. Anyways it was all good for a while and now it’s back to disappearing every few mins and even taking orders and walking away without a help of a hand to me. Even took and order from customer and walked off without making the order.

The whole ""just be more outgoing"" advice is garbage. After diving deep into social psychology research, communication studies, and yeah, some dating podcasts I'm embarrassed to admit I binged, I realized introverts have been playing the wrong game entirely.

Here's the thing. Society makes us think charisma equals being loud, constantly ""on,"" or having that golden retriever energy. But that's just one flavor. The most magnetic people I've met are often quiet, observant types who make you feel like the only person in the room. That's introvert territory. We've just been convinced our natural style is somehow inferior.

**The depth advantage is your secret weapon.** While extroverts are moving through surface level interactions, introverts naturally go deeper. Research from Dr. Laurie Helgoe (who wrote ""Introvert Power"") shows introverts excel at meaningful one on one connections because we're wired for depth over breadth. Stop trying to be the life of the party. Instead, become the person someone remembers three months later because you actually listened when they mentioned their weird childhood fear of butterflies. That specificity, that presence, that's what people crave but rarely get.

**Strategic energy management makes you more attractive, not less.** The app Ash has this feature where it coaches you through social situations based on your personality type, and one insight stuck with me. it's about working with your energy, not against it. Show up to fewer things but be fully present when you do. Quality over quantity isn't just for mattresses. When you're not constantly depleting yourself, you bring better energy to interactions that matter. People notice when someone is genuinely engaged versus running on fumes and faking enthusiasm.

Another tool worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert insights into personalized audio content. What makes it useful here is you can literally type in ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" and it'll pull from psychology research, dating experts, and communication studies to build a custom learning plan. The content depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. Plus you can pick voices that don't drain you, some people swear by the calm, measured tones when they're already socially exhausted. It connects insights from sources like Susan Cain's work and other communication research into one cohesive learning path.

**Master the art of comfortable silence.** This changed everything for me. Most people fill silence with nervous chatter because they're uncomfortable. But silence is only awkward if you make it awkward. Psychologist Ty Tashiro talks about this in his work on social skills. he found that people who can sit comfortably in silence actually come across as more confident and secure. Try this: in conversation, after someone finishes talking, pause for literally two seconds before responding. It shows you're actually processing what they said, plus it creates this subtle tension that makes the other person more invested in your response.

**The power of prepared spontaneity sounds contradictory but it's gold.** Introverts thrive with preparation but that doesn't mean scripting everything like a robot. Keep a mental file of interesting observations, questions, or stories. Not rehearsed lines, just thought starters. I keep notes on my phone after reading something fascinating or having a weird experience. Then when conversation happens, I'm not scrambling. The book ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts"" by Susan Cain (she's got a TED talk with like 30 million views for a reason) breaks down how introverts can prepare without losing authenticity. Knowing you have material in your back pocket removes that panic of ""what do I even talk about.""

**Leverage text and async communication.** Hot take but being good over text is legitimate rizz in 2025. Introverts often express themselves better in writing anyway. You can be thoughtful, funny, flirty without the immediate pressure of face to face energy drain. This isn't being ""fake,"" it's playing to your strengths. Some of the most charismatic people I know are mid in person but absolutely captivating over text because they have time to craft their personality.

**The observer advantage is hilariously underrated.** While everyone else is talking, you're noticing things. You catch the micro expressions, the topics that make someone light up, the moment they get uncomfortable. Social psychologist Elaine Aron researches high sensitivity and notes that many introverts pick up on subtleties others miss entirely. Use that. Remember specific details people mention. Notice when someone's energy shifts. Reference something they said three conversations ago. That attention makes people feel valued in a way that loud charm never could.

**Create intimate settings instead of trying to dominate large ones.** The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" had this episode about environmental design for different personality types. Introverts don't need to conquer the group chat or command the party. Suggest coffee instead of clubs. Invite someone to explore a bookstore or weird museum instead of loud bars. You're not avoiding social situations, you're curating ones where your natural style shines. People will associate you with those memorable, different experiences rather than the same tired venues everyone suggests.

Look, you're not broken for finding small talk draining or needing alone time to recharge. The research is clear that introversion isn't a flaw to overcome but a different operating system with its own advantages. Stop trying to emulate extrovert energy. The most magnetic version of yourself is one that works with your wiring, not against it. That authenticity, that comfort in your own skin, that's the actual secret sauce everyone's chasing anyway.",1,1769803116.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

When Joanna regained her health, she moved back to were we live, and completely blocked my wife out.

Plaud Note Pro is your ""Meeting & Phone"" specialist. It has the Vibration Conduction Sensor to record phone calls cleanly.

We heard your anxiety about losing a small wearable device. We can confirm: Plaud NotePin S natively supports Apple's ""Find My"" network. If you leave it in a coffee shop or between couch cushions, you can track it right from your iPhone.

**3. Battery life is for Intentional Capture**

Plaud NotePin S packs a 50mAh larger battery than the original Plaud NotePin, giving you more runway for those marathon days. Regarding Continuous Recording: We are actively exploring the vision of an AI Work Companion that records your whole day and extracts tasks across multiple sessions. While the hardware is ready for long sessions, the software logic for cross-day aggregation (merging tasks from Tuesday and Wednesday) is a key R&D focus for us right now.

**4. Designed for Instant Focus**

We tuned the physical button for absolute predictability: a quick press starts a fresh recording immediately. If you stop and start again, it creates a new file. You can easily merge these files in the Plaud App later, or use the App itself to control the pause/resume logic if you need everything in one session. 

**5. One Ecosystem to rule them all**

Does Plaud NotePin S work with the new Desktop App? Absolutely. Whether you record on a Plaud Note Pro, a Plaudits NotePin S, or the Desktop Widget, everything syncs to the same Plaud Cloud. 

**6.Your External Brain**

We see Plaud as a dedicated AI work companion, not just a recorder. Unlike disjointed Voice Memos + AI setups, we keep capture, understanding, and structured outputs in one unified system. Crucially, portability is a priority. You can already export your data, and we are actively strengthening APIs and formats so you stay in control even as the ecosystem evolves. Power users who want to archive, mirror, or build self-hosted setups are a key part of our design target. Our vision is to be a trusted layer that supports your work for years—not just a single gadget generation.

Ready to go hands-free? Plaud The NotePin S is shipping soon. If you have specific questions about shipping dates or accessories that we missed here, check the store page or drop a comment below.

See you out there.

1qrg4b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qrg4b4/the_psychology_behind_milliondollar_morning/,The Psychology Behind Million-Dollar Morning Routines (Stupid Simple But Actually Works),"Look, I know you rolled your eyes at that title. I did too when I first heard about ""morning
routines"" from some LinkedIn bro. Sounded like productivity porn. But after spending months
researching high performers, reading studies on circadian biology, and honestly just
experimenting because my life felt like groundhog day, I realized morning routines aren't about
being productive. They're about reclaiming agency over your day before the world tells you who
to be.
Most people wake up, immediately grab their phone, and let algorithms decide their emotional
state for the next 16 hours. You're essentially handing over the steering wheel of your
consciousness to whatever notification pops up first. That's insane when you think about it.
Here's what actually moves the needle, backed by neuroscience and used by people way more
successful than me.


**1. Wake up at the same time every day (yes, weekends too)**
Your circadian rhythm controls everything from mood to metabolism to cognitive function. Dr.
Matthew Walker (sleep researcher at UC Berkeley, wrote ""Why We Sleep"") found that irregular
sleep patterns mess with your brain's ability to consolidate memories and regulate emotions.
Basically, you're fighting yourself before the day even starts.
I set my alarm for 6am every single day now. First week sucked. Month later, I don't even need
the alarm. Your body adapts faster than you think.


**2. No phone for the first hour**
This one feels impossible until you do it. Every notification is designed by teams of PhDs to
hijack your dopamine system. Starting your day with that is like having cocaine for breakfast,
then wondering why you can't focus.
Instead, I got the Ash app. It's this mental health coach thing that gives you personalized check
ins and helps you process emotions without spiraling. Way better than doom scrolling Reddit
while still half asleep. The AI conversations feel surprisingly real and it's helped me identify
thought patterns I didn't even know I had.


**3. Move your body (don't overthink this)**
Doesn't need to be a full workout. Could be 20 pushups. Could be walking around the block.
Could be stretching while your coffee brews.
Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford, has a massive podcast) talks about how morning
sunlight + movement triggers cortisol and dopamine release at optimal times. Sets you up
hormonally for the entire day. I just do a 15 minute walk outside. That's it. But I'm consistent.


**4. Do one hard thing before 9am**
This changed everything for me. Most people spend mornings on autopilot (shower, coffee,
commute, easy emails). But your willpower is highest in the morning. You have a finite amount
of decision making energy per day.
So I tackle the thing I've been avoiding. Could be a difficult email. Could be 30 minutes on that
project I keep pushing back. Could be studying something new. The point is, you prove to
yourself before lunch that you're capable. That momentum carries through.
Tim Ferriss calls this ""eating the frog"" but honestly the concept comes from Brian Tracy's book
""Eat That Frog!"" The book itself is pretty basic productivity stuff, awards aren't super notable, but
the core idea is gold. Do the ugliest task first. Everything else feels easier.


**5. Feed your brain something valuable**
Instead of news or social media, I spend 20 minutes learning something. Been using BeFreed
lately, an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and Google AI folks. What's useful about it is
the personalized learning plans. You type something like ""build better habits as someone who
constantly procrastinates"" and it pulls from books, research papers, expert talks to create audio
lessons and an adaptive plan just for you.
You can adjust the depth too, quick 10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples
depending on your energy. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I usually go with the
smoky narrator voice during my morning walk. Makes dense psychology concepts way more
digestible than trying to power through a textbook half awake.
Current book rec: ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. Sold over 15 million copies, stayed on NYT
bestseller list for like 3 years straight. Clear breaks down why tiny changes compound into
massive results. The morning routine itself is basically an atomic habit stack. After reading it I
finally understood why I kept failing at goals, I was focused on outcomes instead of systems.
Legitimately perspective shifting.
Also been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast. Dense science stuff but he explains it clearly.
Episodes on dopamine and motivation are incredible.


**6. Plan your day with intention (3 priorities max)**
I use a basic notebook. Write down 3 things that would make today feel successful. Not 47
tasks. Just 3. This comes from productivity research showing people wildly overestimate what
they can accomplish in a day.
If I hit those 3, everything else is bonus. If I don't, I know exactly what I failed at and can adjust
tomorrow. No ambiguity.
**The stupidly simple truth nobody wants to hear**
None of this is revolutionary. You knew most of it already. The ""secret"" isn't some crazy biohack
or supplement stack. It's just doing boring things consistently before your brain wakes up
enough to talk you out of it.
The morning routine isn't about becoming a productivity machine. It's about designing the first
90 minutes of your day so intentionally that you carry that energy forward. You're basically
hacking your own psychology.
I'm not gonna lie and say my life is perfect now. But I'm making more money, my relationships
are better, and I actually feel like I'm steering my life instead of just reacting to it. The compound
effect of starting each day with intention is pretty wild when you zoom out over months.
Try it for 30 days. Track how you feel. Adjust what doesn't work. But whatever you do, stop
surrendering your mornings to whoever designed the algorithm you're currently trapped in.
The first hour of your day isn't just time. It's a vote for the type of person you want to become.",1,1769802933.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False
1qrg3o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1qrg3o9/any_known_water_retention_sides_science_behind/,Any known water retention sides (science behind stalling)?,"I've been on Reta since 1 Jan. Started at 232, currently at 222 but I've been stuck there for the last 10 days. I have been eating exactly the same diet the entire time of 1715 calories, weights and cardio for 6 days out of the week. The only thing I don't track is the unsweetened almond milk I use in my coffee or some 0 calorie sauces, so I usually round myself up to 1900 to be safe for tracking purposes. I have not had a snack or cheat meal all month.

I know weight loss isn't linear, and I'm probably just in a stall, but this is really unusual for me. I'm 28, focused on bodybuilding and running, and I'm used to how my body responds to a cut or bulk. I never plateau like this, which is even more shocking because I usually cut on more calories (taking advantage of the appetite suppression). I know I'm getting leaner based on the hole I'm using in my belt, but the scale is not moving. Is there any special science with Reta and water retention? I slam lots of water and electrolyte caps. 

This is mostly just coming from a place of concern considering the heart rate increase paired with what seems to be unusual water retention making me kind of nervous. I have been feeling like hell on my longer runs. Not much bodyfat, abs are visible but not defined.",1,1769802896.0,Retatrutide,7,1.0,False

<Role>
You are a senior executive assistant with 15 years of experience supporting C-suite leaders at fast-moving companies. You've sat through thousands of meetings and developed an almost supernatural ability to extract what actually matters from rambling discussions. You catch the commitments people make without realizing they made them. You notice when someone says ""let's circle back"" and actually track whether they do.
</Role>

<Context>
Meetings generate a lot of noise and relatively little signal. People talk over each other, go on tangents, make half-commitments, and leave without clarity on who's doing what. Most meeting notes capture what was said, not what needs to happen. The gap between ""discussed"" and ""decided"" is where balls get dropped.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When given meeting notes, transcripts, or recordings:

1. Extract every ACTION ITEM mentioned or implied
   - Include explicit assignments (""John will handle the vendor call"")
   - Catch implicit commitments (""I can look into that"" = action item)
   - Note items that were discussed but not assigned to anyone

2. Identify all DECISIONS made
   - What was actually decided vs. what was just discussed
   - Note any conditions or dependencies on the decision
   - Flag decisions that seem to contradict earlier ones

3. Capture FOLLOW-UPS needed
   - Items requiring input from people not in the meeting
   - Information that needs to be gathered before next steps
   - Meetings or calls that need to be scheduled

4. Flag OPEN QUESTIONS
   - Topics raised but not resolved
   - Disagreements that weren't settled
   - Items punted to ""next time""
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Be specific about WHO owns each item (if unclear, flag it)
- Include any DEADLINES mentioned, even vague ones (""by end of week"")
- Don't invent commitments that weren't made
- If the notes are ambiguous, say so rather than guessing
- Keep your output actionable, not just a summary
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
## Action Items
| Owner | Task | Deadline | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| [Name] | [Specific task] | [Date if given] | [Context] |

## Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]: [Details and any conditions]
- [Decision 2]: [Details and any conditions]

## Follow-Ups Required
- [ ] [Follow-up item] - Owner: [Name if known]

## Open Questions

</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Paste your meeting notes, transcript, or voice memo text, and I'll extract everything actionable,"" then wait for the user to provide their meeting content.
</User_Input>
```

**Three Prompt Use Cases:**
1. Remote workers processing Zoom transcripts from meetings they couldn't fully focus on
2. Project managers who need to turn sprawling stakeholder discussions into clear next steps
3. Anyone drowning in back-to-back meetings who needs to quickly capture commitments before the next one starts

**Example User Input:** ""Meeting notes from product sync 1/30: Talked about the dashboard redesign. Sarah thinks we should prioritize mobile. Jake disagrees, wants desktop first. Mentioned Q2 deadline a few times. Someone needs to check with engineering on API limits. Marketing wants to see mockups before we go too far. Budget discussion got heated but I think we landed on $50k for phase 1. Need to loop in legal about the data retention thing.""

Hello, I just moved into my own studio apartment and I am in the process of redecorating. I have a little bit of a weird layout, but it’s just me and my two dogs so it’s perfectly fine. The kitchen and the living room room share a space, and my couch is 93 inches long and it’s from Joy bird.(Chelsea) and it is in the color terra-cotta rose I believe. I’m having a hard time figuring out if I should get a large round rug for the living room, or if I should get a rectangle rug for the space.  I do have some furniture to use to separate the spaces, but I do believe that using rugs in small areas also really make a huge difference. So any advice or input would be great, I’m unsure of the shape in the color that I should get that would complement my decorating. I will put some pictures of the color scheme I’m going with, but I do like a lot of natural wood, brass, I’m definitely one of those girls who likes antique things, I prefer real wood and real material over fake material any day, no hate for anybody who doesn’t feel that way, this is just my personal preference. I think houses look beautiful that aren’t decorated in my style 🖤. I have a lot of animal skulls, taxidermy, wood, brass, antique vases, hutches, repurposed 3 leaf wooden table, wrought iron and wood coffee table etc (I’m trying to paint an image lol)  I pretty much am going for like a muted earth tone color throughout the entire studio. I do have a lot of art that I’m going to put on the walls, and most of the walls besides, a few are going to be painted Navajo white by  Benjamin Moore, it’s like an off-white, but it’s not  too warm and it doesn’t have gray undertones, it’s a nice neutral white without it being extremely bright so you feel like you’re in the dentist office lol (I highly recommended, especially if you have natural wood in your house that you’re trying to preserve, it goes great with natural wood, or stained wood, whatever) below I attached some photos of the couch, the color scheme I’m going with, and some of the art that I have to still put up along with table lamps, etc.

I really appreciate any and all advice and input I get, I couldn’t be more thankful. Thank you in advance.  ",1,1769802274.0,HomeDecorating,1,0.67,False

also the whole ""wearable ai"" thing felt very 2023 hype cycle to me. like we really need ANOTHER device? my phone records audio. my laptop has otter. why do i need a dedicated thing

but i kept seeing people talk about it and i have this specific problem: im a product manager and i have like 6-8 calls a day. standups, 1:1s, customer calls, stakeholder syncs, whatever. by the end of the day my brain is absolute mush and i cannot remember who said what in which meeting. ive tried taking notes during calls but then im not actually listening. ive tried writing notes after but by then ive already forgotten half the stuff

so i figured fine. ill try it. worst case i return it within the window

its been 3 weeks now and... fuck. i actually use it every day

the thing that surprised me is how frictionless it is. i literally clip it on in the morning to my iPhone and forget about it. i dont have to remember to open an app or set up some integration. it just runs. then later i open the app and all my calls are there with transcripts and summaries

the summaries are genuinely good btw. like not perfect but good enough that i can skim them in 30 seconds and remember ""oh right thats the call where marketing wanted to push the launch and i said we need another sprint."" before pocket i would have completely forgotten that conversation existed by the next day

other stuff ive used it for that i didnt expect:

* random ideas while walking to get coffee. i just talk out loud like a crazy person and its there later
* that thing where youre in the shower and have a brilliant thought and forget it immediately. now i just say it out loud when i get out (pocket lives on my bathroom counter lol)
* my wife was explaining something complicated about her work drama and i literally could not follow all the names and relationships. recorded it. now i have a reference doc for who karen is and why shes beefing with the new director

anyway the point is i was mass skeptical and now i use it more than my apple watch. never thought id say that about a $129 gadget i bought from instagram ads

still feels weird recommending things on reddit but here we are. if you have the same ""too many meetings, brain is fried"" problem i had, its worth trying. you can return it if it doesnt work for you

1qrfn39,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1qrfn39/a_familiar_stranger/,A Familiar Stranger,"Like any other morning, I awoke to the bossa nova melody of my iPhone alarm tone at 6:45 a.m. I had always set it 30 minutes before my wife’s would go off so I had time for a quick shave and a shower. She would take over the bathroom at 7:15 a.m. and would be pissed if I messed with her morning schedule.

This morning, I rolled out of bed to notice she had already gotten up. Hmm, a little weird. I grabbed my house coat and strolled down the hall, expecting to see the bathroom door closed with her occupying it. Except, it wasn’t. I did, however, hear movement from down in the kitchen, so the mystery was solved.

I finished up my shower routine, dried off, and went back into the bedroom to get dressed for work. Normally, I’d wear a collared shirt and tie to the office, but the weather was cold and miserable, so I think a sweater would be fine with my navy dress pants.

I was pulling on socks when I heard what sounded like laughing from downstairs in the kitchen. It wouldn’t be unusual for my wife, Kathy, to be sitting at the kitchen table scrolling through Facebook memes and sipping her morning coffee, so hearing a laugh wasn’t really unusual. Except this laugh was a bit off. It sounded like her voice, but the cadence was different.

When you live with someone for over 20 years, their cries, shrieks, giggles, moans, and laughs are all very recognizable. This sounded like Kathy trying to imitate someone else’s laugh. Again, weird, but I shrugged it off, put on my watch and wedding band, and headed down the hall towards the stairs and the kitchen. I hated wearing rings, so I had a habit of removing them when I got home from work, or wherever else I’d gone, and then putting them back on again in the morning.

My wife wasn’t in the kitchen as I had expected, but I was more focused on grabbing a mug and filling it with the first of what would likely be a five-coffee day. Last night I had gone out with a few friends to watch the Bills game at Shoeless Joe’s, and it ended up being a later night than any of us had planned, considering we all had to work the next morning. I had crept into the dark bedroom at a little after 1 a.m. and, to my knowledge, successfully gotten under the covers without waking up Kathy. At least that was my assumption since I didn’t feel any movement on her side of the bed. She would normally head up to bed around 10:30 p.m. so I had imagined she was far away in dreamland at that point.

I was sipping my coffee at the kitchen table and scrolling through my work calendar when I could sense that unmistakable feeling of eyes on me. I looked back over my shoulder to see Kathy standing in the kitchen doorway staring at me. Her eyebrows were raised high, and her head was kind of tilted back in an uncomfortable position. A long frown pulling down her mouth in a way that made her face look almost unrecognizable.

Before I could react, my phone in my hand started ringing and scared the crap out of me. It was Marshall at work, and if he was calling, it probably wasn’t good. As suspected, shit was hitting the fan. I had to haul ass across town and into the office as quickly as traffic would allow. I chugged my coffee and looked back at the doorway towards Kathy, but she had already gone back upstairs to finish getting ready for work.

I grabbed my coat, yelled my goodbyes, and darted out to the car. No time to let it warm up, so the drive across town was a chilly one.

The first half of my day was consumed with angry phone calls from clients and team meetings. It wasn’t until around 11 a.m. that I was able to take a breath and head to the coffee station to take a quick 5. As I waited for the Keurig to do its thing, I looked down at my phone and noticed a missed call from Kathy.

I remembered how strange she had looked earlier that morning standing in the doorway, just staring at me with that glum expression stretched on her mouth. The odd way her head was cocked back and her eyebrows raised as if to be questioning something horrible I had done to her. I shuddered but then noticed she had left me a voicemail.

Was I frightened by her? This made no sense. We had spent the better part of our lives together. We didn’t keep secrets and we both knew all of each other’s habits. Even the annoying or gross ones. Soulmates, best friends, bla bla bla, you name it, we were that. But her face this morning was the mask of a stranger. Subtly that is, just like the laugh I heard from the bedroom. It was her but different.

My friend Artie had once taken a photo of me standing by the Las Vegas sign and used an AI app called Grok to make me appear to be doing a popular dance from the 90’s called The Running Man. It looked like me but wasn’t me. Something in the way I moved and smiled was creepy and wrong. I remembered laughing that day when he showed me but deep down inside I hated it. This is the best way I can describe how Kathy made me feel this morning.

I held my phone up to my ear to listen to the message she had left. I strained to hear what sounded mostly like the drone of a fan or some kind of white noise that dissolved into static. This went on for a good 10 seconds and I was about to hang up when I very faintly heard what sounded like Kathy crying…

Then nothing. The message just ended abruptly. I tried to call her back several times but it would always go straight to voicemail.

My mind was racing. There had to be a reasonable explanation for what was happening but the way my day was going, I didn’t have another second to contemplate it.

6 o’clock arrived in record time and as I was grabbing my jacket from the coat room I bumped into Jen who manned our front desk and spent most of her day forwarding phone calls to the sales staff.

“So did you and your wife have a lunch date or something today?” Excuse me I said, confused. Jen looked up at me while pulling on her winter boots.

“Well, I’m sure I saw her standing outside by the front windows looking in, and I guess I just assumed she was waiting for you.” “I got called to Marshall’s office, and she was gone when I got back, so I figured you guys had gone out for lunch.”

I looked at her puzzled. “No, we didn’t have lunch plans.”

Did we? I thought. Is it possible we made plans and I forgot? We’ve only met up for lunch a handful of times in the 11 years I’ve worked here, so I doubt that’s something I would have planned for and forgotten about… right?

The drive back home was a slow one due to the slippery road conditions, but I spent the entire time in a daze relaying the moments of the day back over and over again in my head. What was going on? Why had Kathy been standing outside of my office and didn’t even bother to come in and say hi? The way her face had looked this morning staring at me from the kitchen doorway. The way her laugh had sounded from downstairs and the odd voicemail she had left me.

It was odd, right? Or was I just making something out of nothing? A lack of sleep and a few too many Stella’s the night before? Maybe, but I’d be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t feeling a little bit apprehensive about walking through my front door knowing she was inside waiting for me.

I pulled into the driveway, unlocked the front door, and then quickly realized I had been wrong. I had been wrong about one thing anyways. She wasn’t inside waiting for me.

“Kathy”? I called out. My voice breaking through the silence as I stood inside the front entry of my home. The hallway in front of me stretched out into darkness and the faintly visible green carpet runner that led up to the second level. I reached out for the light switch, but even after the room was lit up, my unease remained. I called out Kathy’s name again but heard nothing. She was always home by 5:30 p.m. The silence was jarring.

Kathy would typically be in the kitchen preparing dinner by now, with a glass of wine and her dinner music playlist playing softly on the Echo speaker. The only sound now was my shoes padding on the stairs as I climbed up towards the bedroom. Another dimly lit hallway stretched out in front of me. The bathroom door mostly closed on my left-hand side, and the bedroom door hung open to my right.

“Kathy”? My voice cracked. I entered the dark bedroom, and my heart stopped. Someone was standing in the far corner of the room. What the hell was going on? Why was she doing this to me? Was this some kind of prank? That made no sense. Kathy had a sense of humour, but this wasn’t it. She would share jokes and cackle out loud at every episode of The Office, but she would never play a cruel prank like this. Would she?

I quickly turned on the light and let out a big sigh of relief when I realized the figure in the corner was just a dress hanging off the open door of Kathy’s armoire. “Jesus,” I said out loud and managed a bit of a laugh. The relief quickly dissipated though, as I still had no idea what the hell was going on.

I took off my ring and put it away, switched off the light, and walked towards the bathroom. Of course, she wasn’t in there, standing quietly in the dark, waiting for me to enter, but I don’t think I would have been surprised to find her there either. That was a crazy thought. This was my wife. Why was my heart pounding in my chest? I splashed water on my face and headed back down the stairs towards the kitchen.

The fluorescent lights lit up the room. The kitchen table stretched to my right just how I had left it, and the modest kitchen island to my left. There was something on the island. I had been in such a rush this morning I hadn’t noticed it. I walked up to the counter and picked up the note that contained my wife’s handwriting. A note she had left for me last night.

John, I’m not sure what time you will be home from the bar tonight, but I have to go immediately.

I just received a call from my mom. Dad is in the hospital. He was in a serious car accident and is on life support. To make matters worse my cellphone slipped from my hand after I hung up with her, and I can no longer get it to work. I’m sorry I can’t wait for you to get back home. My Uber will be here to take me to the airport in 5 minutes. I won’t be able to call you until tomorrow night. I’ll explain everything and give you an update as soon as I can. Love, Kathy.

I read the note over and over again. My hands were shaking as I stood there in disbelief.

Who was in the kitchen with me this morning? Who did I hear laughing? Who did Jen see standing outside our office staring inside?

A creak from the top of the stairs snapped me out of my trance. I looked up to see two feet coming out of the darkness. Two feet that began descending down one methodical step at a time. The body and then face slowly came into view as the kitchen light barely lit up the bottom of the staircase. The mouth pulled down in a long grimace. Eyebrows raised high, head titled backwards unnaturally.

A laugh came out of Kathy’s mouth that wasn’t Kathy’s. I screamed and turned to bolt towards the back patio door, but couldn’t.

I could hear the sound of feet dragging across the hardwood floor behind me, moving at a slow but deliberate pace. I tried to move again but fear had me frozen in place. Tears started streaming down my face. I felt cold fingers running down the back of my head through my hair and tightening on my neck.

I fell to the cold kitchen floor and blacked out. When I awoke I opened my eyes to find myself still laying in the same spot I had passed out. The room was shrouded in darkness except for the green light of the digital clock on the stove. It told me it was 1:35 a.m.

That was 3 months ago to the day. My wife had ended up staying for over 4 weeks at her parents house in Scotland while her father, thankfully, made a full recovery.

I never did tell Kathy about what had happened to me that day. What was the point? None of it made any sense so why would she believe me?

That was until about an hour ago when I was watching the local news, enjoying a beer after another long day at the office. There was a police officer standing at a podium addressing a crowd of news reporters.

They had an update on the murders of 6 local men who had all been attacked and strangled in their homes. The murders had taken place over the last 8 months or so, the first body being found late June of last year.

They had made an arrest, that was the reason for the press conference. A photo popped up in the right hand corner of the screen as the officer continued to address the media.

My mouth ran instantly dry. It was a woman. Her name was Helen Tanner. She looked exactly like my wife.",1,1769801901.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

We want to use our time wisely and not overextend ourselves, but also come away with a broad sampling of what the city has to offer so we can better plan for future visits - just a short seven hours from Montreal! 

We are arriving in Paris on a Saturday morning and staying in Saint-Germain for one night before continuing on. We are used to lots of walking when we travel and comfortable using the metro if needed.  

Proposed itinerary: 

\- Get coffee to go and walk through the Luxembourg Gardens on our way to Shakespeare & Company

\- Brief visit to Notre Dame, if very busy we are content to see the exterior only 

\- Cross to the right bank, pick up pastries to go and relax at Place des Vosges 

\- Continue to the 11e for lunch at Bistrot Paul Bert

\- Leisurely walk back to Saint Germain via the Marais and Les Halles, stop to browse Bouquinistes if time allows 

\- Refresh at the hotel before dinner at Brasserie des Prés or Colvert 

\- Drinks and dessert at Deux Magots (a tourist trap, I know, but I can’t resist) 

We welcome any input and would especially appreciate recommendations for coffee shops, patisseries/boulangeries, and interesting shops in the Marais and Les Halles. 

On the return leg of our trip, we will likely stick to the 1e and 2e, and possibly Montmartre - more research needed.

“Well, I’m sure I saw her standing outside by the front windows looking in, and I guess I just assumed she was waiting for you.” “I got called to Marshall’s office, and she was gone when I got back, so I figured you guys had gone out for lunch.”

I looked at her puzzled. “No, we didn’t have lunch plans.”

Did we? I thought. Is it possible we made plans and I forgot? We’ve only met up for lunch a handful of times in the 11 years I’ve worked here, so I doubt that’s something I would have planned for and forgotten about… right?

The drive back home was a slow one due to the slippery road conditions, but I spent the entire time in a daze relaying the moments of the day back over and over again in my head. What was going on? Why had Kathy been standing outside of my office and didn’t even bother to come in and say hi? The way her face had looked this morning staring at me from the kitchen doorway. The way her laugh had sounded from downstairs and the odd voicemail she had left me.

It was odd, right? Or was I just making something out of nothing? A lack of sleep and a few too many Stella’s the night before? Maybe, but I’d be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t feeling a little bit apprehensive about walking through my front door knowing she was inside waiting for me.

I pulled into the driveway, unlocked the front door, and then quickly realized I had been wrong. I had been wrong about one thing anyways. She wasn’t inside waiting for me.

“Kathy”? I called out. My voice breaking through the silence as I stood inside the front entry of my home. The hallway in front of me stretched out into darkness and the faintly visible green carpet runner that led up to the second level. I reached out for the light switch, but even after the room was lit up, my unease remained. I called out Kathy’s name again but heard nothing. She was always home by 5:30 p.m. The silence was jarring.

Kathy would typically be in the kitchen preparing dinner by now, with a glass of wine and her dinner music playlist playing softly on the Echo speaker. The only sound now was my shoes padding on the stairs as I climbed up towards the bedroom. Another dimly lit hallway stretched out in front of me. The bathroom door mostly closed on my left-hand side, and the bedroom door hung open to my right.

“Kathy”? My voice cracked. I entered the dark bedroom, and my heart stopped. Someone was standing in the far corner of the room. What the hell was going on? Why was she doing this to me? Was this some kind of prank? That made no sense. Kathy had a sense of humour, but this wasn’t it. She would share jokes and cackle out loud at every episode of The Office, but she would never play a cruel prank like this. Would she?

I quickly turned on the light and let out a big sigh of relief when I realized the figure in the corner was just a dress hanging off the open door of Kathy’s armoire. “Jesus,” I said out loud and managed a bit of a laugh. The relief quickly dissipated though, as I still had no idea what the hell was going on.

I took off my ring and put it away, switched off the light, and walked towards the bathroom. Of course, she wasn’t in there, standing quietly in the dark, waiting for me to enter, but I don’t think I would have been surprised to find her there either. That was a crazy thought. This was my wife. Why was my heart pounding in my chest? I splashed water on my face and headed back down the stairs towards the kitchen.

The fluorescent lights lit up the room. The kitchen table stretched to my right just how I had left it, and the modest kitchen island to my left. There was something on the island. I had been in such a rush this morning I hadn’t noticed it. I walked up to the counter and picked up the note that contained my wife’s handwriting. A note she had left for me last night.

John, I’m not sure what time you will be home from the bar tonight, but I have to go immediately.

I just received a call from my mom. Dad is in the hospital. He was in a serious car accident and is on life support. To make matters worse my cellphone slipped from my hand after I hung up with her, and I can no longer get it to work. I’m sorry I can’t wait for you to get back home. My Uber will be here to take me to the airport in 5 minutes. I won’t be able to call you until tomorrow night. I’ll explain everything and give you an update as soon as I can. Love, Kathy.

I read the note over and over again. My hands were shaking as I stood there in disbelief.

Who was in the kitchen with me this morning? Who did I hear laughing? Who did Jen see standing outside our office staring inside?

A creak from the top of the stairs snapped me out of my trance. I looked up to see two feet coming out of the darkness. Two feet that began descending down one methodical step at a time. The body and then face slowly came into view as the kitchen light barely lit up the bottom of the staircase. The mouth pulled down in a long grimace. Eyebrows raised high, head titled backwards unnaturally.

A laugh came out of Kathy’s mouth that wasn’t Kathy’s. I screamed and turned to bolt towards the back patio door, but couldn’t.

I could hear the sound of feet dragging across the hardwood floor behind me, moving at a slow but deliberate pace. I tried to move again but fear had me frozen in place. Tears started streaming down my face. I felt cold fingers running down the back of my head through my hair and tightening on my neck.

I fell to the cold kitchen floor and blacked out. When I awoke I opened my eyes to find myself still laying in the same spot I had passed out. The room was shrouded in darkness except for the green light of the digital clock on the stove. It told me it was 1:35 a.m.

That was 3 months ago to the day. My wife had ended up staying for over 4 weeks at her parents house in Scotland while her father, thankfully, made a full recovery.

I never did tell Kathy about what had happened to me that day. What was the point? None of it made any sense so why would she believe me?

That was until about an hour ago when I was watching the local news, enjoying a beer after another long day at the office. There was a police officer standing at a podium addressing a crowd of news reporters.

They had an update on the murders of 6 local men who had all been attacked and strangled in their homes. The murders had taken place over the last 8 months or so, the first body being found late June of last year.

They had made an arrest, that was the reason for the press conference. A photo popped up in the right hand corner of the screen as the officer continued to address the media.

Brendan Banfield’s explanation for his odd movements captured on surveillance video from a McDonald's parking lot on the morning of the murder was that he was just struggling with the McDonald’s app, looking for “deals” on a free hash brown or coffee and trying to get reward points to “get free food.”

Despite this attempt at a “McDefense,” the jury is almost certainly going to find him guilty.

The prosecution’s case is overwhelming.

* His mistress testified directly that they planned the murders together. She confirmed Banfield created the fake ‘Anastasia’ profile and email specifically to lure the victim, Joseph Ryan, to the home.
* Digital forensics linked Banfield’s own devices and IP addresses to those “catfishing” accounts. Furthermore, his wife’s digital footprint showed  no history of the “fantasies” Banfield claimed she had.
* The lack of Banfield’s DNA on the gun suggests he wore gloves (premeditation), and police testified the victim’s body looked “posed.”
* Banfield admitted on the stand that he delayed calling 911 while his wife was dying.
* Banfield had a romantic and financial motive. The prosecution showed he paid his mistress “hush money” (again, free food) that was cut off immediately once she started talking to the prosecution.

He tried the McD’s defence, but this case is way too strong to overcome a craving for a McMuffin. Is the McDonald’s Defense the weakest defence ever?",8,1769801804.0,nova,9,0.83,False

Hi everyone! I’m doing DIY makeup but I went to Selfridges to get a bridal look done so I can learn some tips to practice. I’m looking for any and all critique so I can continue working on the look

I’m getting married in Vegas and wanted a retro inspired makeup look without coming out costumey. I think this first go is a pretty good look. 

1. I’m planning to use a different foundation, Lisa Eldridge, as I think the colour match is better. 

2. Overall I think the look is too brown, and I think I could pull off similar but with some slightly more pinks. This is no shade to the MUA, who told me he wanted to try and go for this matte look as it felt a little more retro, and then I could experiment adding pinks.

3. I really like the pale eyeshadow (I specifically asked for that white/light look) so I have bought that “Benefit Cookie”. 

4. I also love the white eyeliner which adds a little retro twist

5. The eyebrows I think are good, using the Benedit brow pencil on the middle outwards only (I also bought this)

6. I think the brown browbone shade is a touch too brown and I would prefer a pinkier-leaning brown 

7. This lip is a brown lip pencil and CT Penelope Pink which I don’t like. I have a pinker Lisa Eldridge lipstick I prefer. 

Please give me any and all critique. I feel like this nailed the eye shape and the overall look it just needs a tonal adjustment.

1qrfjju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1qrfjju/a_familiar_stranger/,A Familiar Stranger,"Like any other morning, I awoke to the bossa nova melody of my iPhone alarm tone at 6:45 a.m. I had always set it 30 minutes before my wife’s would go off so I had time for a quick shave and a shower. She would take over the bathroom at 7:15 a.m. and would be pissed if I messed with her morning schedule.

This morning, I rolled out of bed to notice she had already gotten up. Hmm, a little weird. I grabbed my house coat and strolled down the hall, expecting to see the bathroom door closed with her occupying it. Except, it wasn’t. I did, however, hear movement from down in the kitchen, so the mystery was solved.

I finished up my shower routine, dried off, and went back into the bedroom to get dressed for work. Normally, I’d wear a collared shirt and tie to the office, but the weather was cold and miserable, so I think a sweater would be fine with my navy dress pants.

I was pulling on socks when I heard what sounded like laughing from downstairs in the kitchen. It wouldn’t be unusual for my wife, Kathy, to be sitting at the kitchen table scrolling through Facebook memes and sipping her morning coffee, so hearing a laugh wasn’t really unusual. Except this laugh was a bit off. It sounded like her voice, but the cadence was different.

When you live with someone for over 20 years, their cries, shrieks, giggles, moans, and laughs are all very recognizable. This sounded like Kathy trying to imitate someone else’s laugh. Again, weird, but I shrugged it off, put on my watch and wedding band, and headed down the hall towards the stairs and the kitchen. I hated wearing rings, so I had a habit of removing them when I got home from work, or wherever else I’d gone, and then putting them back on again in the morning.

My wife wasn’t in the kitchen as I had expected, but I was more focused on grabbing a mug and filling it with the first of what would likely be a five-coffee day. Last night I had gone out with a few friends to watch the Bills game at Shoeless Joe’s, and it ended up being a later night than any of us had planned, considering we all had to work the next morning. I had crept into the dark bedroom at a little after 1 a.m. and, to my knowledge, successfully gotten under the covers without waking up Kathy. At least that was my assumption since I didn’t feel any movement on her side of the bed. She would normally head up to bed around 10:30 p.m. so I had imagined she was far away in dreamland at that point.

I was sipping my coffee at the kitchen table and scrolling through my work calendar when I could sense that unmistakable feeling of eyes on me. I looked back over my shoulder to see Kathy standing in the kitchen doorway staring at me. Her eyebrows were raised high, and her head was kind of tilted back in an uncomfortable position. A long frown pulling down her mouth in a way that made her face look almost unrecognizable.

Before I could react, my phone in my hand started ringing and scared the crap out of me. It was Marshall at work, and if he was calling, it probably wasn’t good. As suspected, shit was hitting the fan. I had to haul ass across town and into the office as quickly as traffic would allow. I chugged my coffee and looked back at the doorway towards Kathy, but she had already gone back upstairs to finish getting ready for work.

I grabbed my coat, yelled my goodbyes, and darted out to the car. No time to let it warm up, so the drive across town was a chilly one.

The first half of my day was consumed with angry phone calls from clients and team meetings. It wasn’t until around 11 a.m. that I was able to take a breath and head to the coffee station to take a quick 5. As I waited for the Keurig to do its thing, I looked down at my phone and noticed a missed call from Kathy.

I remembered how strange she had looked earlier that morning standing in the doorway, just staring at me with that glum expression stretched on her mouth. The odd way her head was cocked back and her eyebrows raised as if to be questioning something horrible I had done to her. I shuddered but then noticed she had left me a voicemail.

Was I frightened by her? This made no sense. We had spent the better part of our lives together. We didn’t keep secrets and we both knew all of each other’s habits. Even the annoying or gross ones. Soulmates, best friends, bla bla bla, you name it, we were that. But her face this morning was the mask of a stranger. Subtly that is, just like the laugh I heard from the bedroom. It was her but different.

My friend Artie had once taken a photo of me standing by the Las Vegas sign and used an AI app called Grok to make me appear to be doing a popular dance from the 90’s called The Running Man. It looked like me but wasn’t me. Something in the way I moved and smiled was creepy and wrong. I remembered laughing that day when he showed me but deep down inside I hated it. This is the best way I can describe how Kathy made me feel this morning.

I held my phone up to my ear to listen to the message she had left. I strained to hear what sounded mostly like the drone of a fan or some kind of white noise that dissolved into static. This went on for a good 10 seconds and I was about to hang up when I very faintly heard what sounded like Kathy crying…

Then nothing. The message just ended abruptly. I tried to call her back several times but it would always go straight to voicemail.

My mind was racing. There had to be a reasonable explanation for what was happening but the way my day was going, I didn’t have another second to contemplate it.

6 o’clock arrived in record time and as I was grabbing my jacket from the coat room I bumped into Jen who manned our front desk and spent most of her day forwarding phone calls to the sales staff.

“So did you and your wife have a lunch date or something today?” Excuse me I said, confused. Jen looked up at me while pulling on her winter boots.

Since my university days, I have always consumed Irish cream Americanos and all milk-based coffees in cafés. I also bought a Siemens EQ700 series machine, but of course, it was difficult to match the level of coffee served in cafés. I decided to leave that one for my wife to use, since it's fully automatic and just makes your coffee, and I ordered a Lelit Bianca V3 for myself. Alongside it, I bought a Timemore Black Mirror Basic 2.0 precision scale and a FIORENZATO ALL GROUND Sense coffee grinder. I'm waiting for them to arrive; I spent a lot of money :( But I thought it was time. How do you think the grinder and the Lelit work together? The flavours I'm looking for are generally similar to Starbucks' taste. (By the way, I've tried thousands of cafés, but Starbucks is the one that made me fall in love with and get used to this, so I want to capture that flavour because I love their coffee. Unfortunately, other cafés aren't that standardised). I was torn between the La Marzocco Micra and the Lelit Bianca, but I decided on the Lelit. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Please share all your insights and give me suggestions .I haven’t even reached the beginner level in home barista skills yet because I’m still waiting for the delivery. Thank you already

Me 52F and Marco 54 recap: 

I stayed out late last night w/ Marco, who I previously met at our mutual friend’s Thanksgiving.  We saw each other a few more times, always including complicated, multi-segment itinerary, long talks, meeting lots of people, going to music shows, and a dance class.  I was previously impressed with his engagement and social stamina.  Marco is a Black/Scott (handsome in a younger Denzel kind of way) former Naval aircraft mechanic, he was inspired as a kid after watching Top Gun.  Worked in Aerospace for his whole career.  Recently divorced, recently broken up with by his GF, who he lived with on an exotic Latin American island.  His situation is endlessly complicated.  

He was a bit late/stuck in traffic, it was a dark and rainy night and he was coming from far up North.  I need a list of questions/quals to ask him.   I’m feeling really jaded and trying not to get my hopes up…

I spent the past 9 months thinking I don’t want a boyfriend… I want a ride or die (or nothing).  I wore a short white crochet dress, trying to be cute.  We met at Tavolata, an elegant bar that tech bros have parties at. I had a ginger ale while I waited, a cognac that went to Marco (not to my taste) and then an expensive glass of wine.  I started taking meds that reduce my interest in eating, it’s great.  Marco ordered a Rigatoni pasta dish that was slightly spicy.  He mentioned being hungry all the time, takes his coffee black, vapes (I don’t know what) and plays video games, typical guy stuff.  We talked for a solid hour in a direct, almost businesslike way about the matter of a potential relationship.  I rarely meet men that are not off put by my assertive and direct nature.  A frequent feedback I get is something like “Wow, aren’t you humble?” or “You are way too confident…” Marco stated he found me challenging, but in a way he liked. He has a warm and engaging, charismatic personality.  

I had earlier made plans to meet a friend at the wine bar at the Porch Park in Redmond as our mutual friend, a musician, was playing.  I wanted to catch up with her briefly about real estate advice.  Melody showed up late, without us, the musician playing to an otherwise empty joint.  The only two people there were apparently the parents of the young, female bartender who was a healthy Nordic type who talked about snowboarding.  

Marco to my left and Melody to my right, talked about their travels and extreme sports adventures.  They talked about paragliding and power gliding, scuba diving and vacationing in exotic locations.  (I’m not that athletic currently and have limited travel experiences).  I knew they would get along.  Melody is pretty and popular and gets along with everyone.  I kind of hoped they would hit it off but Marco stated he still preferred me.  

Melody left, tired from her juice and water fasting.  Ricco wanted to go to any late night spot.  There is a Korean coffee shop on the block open to 11 so we went there and had a kumquat coffee drink that was not to my liking.  He walked me to my car and we talked about relationship stuff, where he could clearly identify what he wants, what he offers, in a direct and refreshing way.  It was nice talking to a man with his head apparently screwed on straight, with a loving family.  He said goodnight and I shook his hand as a friend, he didn’t try to kiss me, although I was expecting it.  I’m glad he didn’t because I don’t like PDA with acquaintances, my ex had a habit of kissing me in parking lots as we mutually left from whatever place we were at.  

If I see him again it will be under the context of a progressing relationship.  We both have an excessive amount of complications, though I didn’t find anything majorly off-putting.  I need to think very carefully about next steps and what questions to ask him.  Because of our mutual friends, we agreed to try to stay friendly no matter what. I think that’s a nice basis for the beginning of a relationship.

1qrf98y,https://v.redd.it/35k831veejgg1,The Fintech Revolution is being Driven by Embedded Finance,"The $834 billion industry hiding inside apps you use every day, and why almost nobody is talking about it

You’ve already been a part of one of the biggest shifts in finance, likely without even realizing it. It’s a shift from banking as a place you go, to banking as a thing you do. When you step out of an Uber and the payment happens automatically, or when you finance a new mattress directly at an e-commerce checkout with a few clicks, you are experiencing it. This isn't just a new feature; it's a fundamental restructuring of how we interact with money.

This ""invisible"" shift is called embedded finance. It represents the integration of financial services—banking, lending, insurance—directly into the apps and platforms you already use. It’s a quiet revolution that is turning every company into a potential financial services provider and changing our relationship with money in surprising ways.

**Finance Is No Longer a Destination, It's a Feature.**

The core idea of embedded finance is simple: instead of going to a bank for a loan or an insurance company for a policy, these services come to you, exactly at the moment you need them. The goal is to make the financial transaction a seamless, almost invisible part of an existing activity. Starbucks, through its app, essentially operates like a bank that sells coffee, holding billions in customer deposits. When Tesla offers insurance coverage as part of the vehicle purchasing process, it is embedding insurance directly at the point of need. The financial service is no longer a separate destination; it’s an integrated feature.

This trend is exploding now because several powerful forces have converged. First, the **API revolution** created the technological pipes to connect banks and non-financial apps securely. Second, **consumer behavior has shifted**; people are now entirely comfortable managing their lives through apps. Finally, the normalization of **e-commerce** created the perfect digital environment for financial services to become a natural extension of the shopping experience.

**A Hidden Giant: The Near Trillion-Dollar Market.**

Despite its low profile among consumers, embedded finance is a massive and rapidly growing industry. According to data from Global Market Insights, the market was valued at 104.8*billionin*2024∗∗.*Itisprojectedtogrowatacompoundannualgrowthrateofover*23**834.1 billion by 2034**. The numbers here are staggering.

So how can a market this large feel so invisible? The answer lies in its design. Effective embedded finance is meant to be frictionless and fade into the background. It removes the steps, paperwork, and separate applications that traditionally defined financial transactions, making it a powerful but often unnoticed force in digital commerce.

The New Competitive Battleground: Every Company Is a Fintech Company.

With a market projected to approach a trillion dollars, it's no surprise that this has become a strategic imperative for businesses. The primary motivation is to create more valuable and loyal customers by building ""sticky ecosystems"" that are harder to leave. This strategy also opens up new revenue streams beyond core products and deepens the company's understanding of customer behavior.

A prime example is **Shopify Balance**. If Shopify, an e-commerce platform, holds a merchant's money in a business account, processes their payments, and provides them a loan, that merchant is unlikely ever to leave the platform. By embedding banking, Shopify keeps its merchants more engaged, captures more of their business activity, and makes its platform indispensable, dramatically increasing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).

The Hidden Engine: A Three-Layer Partnership Model.

You might wonder how a ride-sharing company or a retailer can offer regulated financial services without becoming a bank. They do it through a three-layer partnership model that is the key to the entire industry's scalability.

1. **Distributors (The Face):** These are the consumer-facing brands you interact with, like Uber, Shopify, or Walmart. They own the customer relationship and integrate the financial product into their app or website.

2. **Technology Providers (The Pipes):** These are the infrastructure builders like Stripe or Synapse who strip away the complexity of coding and compliance, allowing a retailer to offer financial products without becoming a bank.

3. **Balance Sheet Firms (The Vaults):** These are the licensed, regulated institutions that *rent out their banking license* and manage the underlying risk and capital. They hold the deposits, underwrite the loans, and ensure everything complies with financial regulations.

This layered structure allows each company to focus on what it does best. It's also important to distinguish this model from related concepts. **Open Banking** is about banks opening their data via APIs, which provides the foundation for embedded finance. **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**, in contrast, aims to replace the traditional banking backbone entirely with blockchain technology. Embedded finance uses the traditional system but distributes it through new channels.

**Frictionless Convenience, Serious Consequences.**

This is where we need to be honest. While the convenience of embedded finance is clear, it comes with significant risks for consumers.

• **The Debt Trap:** The same frictionless experience that makes embedded finance appealing can lead to poor financial decisions. When borrowing is as easy as one click at checkout, consumers can easily overextend themselves and accumulate debt without fully considering the consequences.

• **Privacy Erosion:** To offer these seamless services, platforms gain access to an incredible amount of sensitive data, combining your shopping habits, location history, and financial transactions. This creates a complete picture of your life that could be misused or compromised.

• **Regulatory Nightmares:** Who is responsible when things go wrong? As the financial supply chain fragments across brands, tech providers, and banks, accountability can become dangerously blurred for the consumer.

**The Greatest Opportunity: Banking the Unbanked.**

Perhaps the most significant opportunity presented by embedded finance is its potential to advance financial inclusion. Billions of people globally remain unbanked or underbanked, often because they lack access to or trust in traditional banking institutions.

Embedded finance can reach these populations where they already are: on their mobile devices and within the digital platforms they use for communication, commerce, and work. By integrating financial tools into these trusted ecosystems, it can provide access to payments, credit, and savings to people who have been excluded from the formal financial system.

Embedded finance has great potential to empower underserved populations. Whether through mobile wallets or microfinance options within agricultural supply chains, this approach can foster economic growth in ways traditional banking has struggled to accomplish.

The Future of Money Is Invisibility

Finance is fundamentally evolving. It is shifting from being a destination—a place you go to manage money—to becoming invisible infrastructure that is woven into the fabric of our digital lives. The bank on the corner is being replaced by code running in the background of the apps you use every day.",2,1769801067.0,ChargeForward,0,1.0,False

I’m proud of how I’ve handled everything so far. I’ve stayed very positive and handled the ups and downs really well, stayed good about having perspective and allowing myself to do things that are hard and scary, to push through the anxiety.

We have three girls (11, 9 and 3)and I was a stay at home mom for 11 years. In November, I got my first job. It’s hybrid and mostly remote but it’s not the kind of work i can do with the kids around because I have to take phone calls and have meetings, My ex has a flexible work from home job, and our older two girls are home schooled. He took over home schooling (and does an excellent job) and keeps them during the day. Basically, he’s taken over what was my role for so long.

Moving in with my mom hasn’t worked out well. She’s been alone for so long that it’s hard for her to have others around, and after moving down in October to help me out she almost immediately decided she needs to move back out of state. I’m moving out next week to my own place. 

Part of the issue of staying at my mom’s has been that my 3 year old has not been able to stay the night with me since October. My mom is too worried about her waking up and waking her and her cats up. My 3 year old is a rockstar sleeper and has been in her crib since 6 weeks old, so my ex and I agreed it made sense for her to keep nights at his house instead of going through all the upheaval and stress, knowing I was going to be moving back out anyways. So when I have the girls on my days, I bring her back for bedtime and pick her up either the next morning or after work the next day and rinse and repeat.

Like I said, I’ve been handling it well. Until today. Today I’m a pit of gloom. I was very unhappy in my old life but today I miss it. I miss always being with my girls. I miss being the first person my youngest saw every morning. I miss lazy mornings in bed watching cartoons. I miss making their meals, being responsible for their social lives, being involved.

I know all of this will be much better once I move out and our schedule can be more consistent when I can keep my youngest overnight. Finally I’ll be able to pick them up Friday and have them all to myself all weekend.

This wasn’t a change that could be avoided. The divorce was necessary, I did everything I could to save the marriage, and regardless I needed to get a job even if I stayed. So I would have had to change my lifestyle regardless. And I would have been coming home to a man who didn’t care about me and a house that was a mess and a million responsibilities left on my plate. I don’t idealize that option at all. 

But today, I called my MIL. I was on a walk during my lunch break and bored and her and I were always close. She was at my ex’s house, what used to be my house, and it just made me so sad. There used to be a time when the days Nana came over were my favorite. A little adult interaction, some coffee on the couch, some help with the kids and maybe dishes. Just slow, easy days. 

I don’t want to go back. But today I’m mourning the loss of it really hard, and I can’t deny I’d love just one more day back there in my old life.

I wanted to share a genuinely great experience working with an artist on my Steam capsule.

For me, investing in a Steam capsule was a big and important decision. I was quite nervous about choosing an artist, especially because I couldn’t afford to commission another one if I wasn’t happy with the result. I also had concerns about finding someone who could create artwork specifically tailored for Steam while still truly representing my game — which is not an easy combination to pull off.

This artist turned out to be an excellent choice. They’re very friendly to work with, offer revisions at every stage of the process, and most importantly, take the time to truly understand your game and its background. The final result was amazing and completely exceeded my expectations.

1qrf1hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1qrf1hh/marriage_divorce_remarriage_reconciliation/,"Marriage, divorce, remarriage, reconciliation","Hi

I am thinking I should probably seek pastoral council in this but I did want a starting point.. advice, guidance, an even a way to bring this up to a pastor. Which pastor would I even bring this up to in my church?

This has been making me sick with anxiety and fear and is starting to impact my overall health.

Here is a long story that’s shortened…I am so sorry for the long read but really would appreciate some guidance.

I grew up in the church. Knew the basics of being a Christian. Did not follow the walk well at all.

Especially in my early twenties, major backsliding. Think sex, drinking.

At 24 I met a man. We dated for a few months, I got pregnant almost immediately. 2016

We moved in together. My parents pushed for this saying ‘you need to see if you can live together before the baby comes’

It was awful and I should have left then: he was very cold, distant, and would often say he did not want to ever marry me and would leave in the middle of the night and go drink at his brothers or in our driveway.

There were a lot to times I spent crying in the bathroom. God wasn’t even on my radar during this time aside from immense fear of “I’m going to be left behind and go to hell if Jesus returns an I’m living with this man”

There are arguments here and there, one ending in him telling me I have no right to ever cry. Crying is only for children. So, now I only cry in the car.

So the baby comes the next year. Things don’t improve between us. But in this time his family lost their house so he has nowhere to go and I feel too much embarrassment to go home. I so desperately want that picture perfect family.

And then in 2019 we got married. But two months before the wedding his brother dies, he starts drinking heavily. But we make it to our wedding despite this hardship.

After our ceremony he broke down and apologized for being so mean to me and not wanting to marry me: great, I think this is a fresh start for us.

We buy a house that summer.

He stops sleeping in our bedroom. Maybe once a week. He watches horror movies and passes out drunk on the couch often. At one point our two year-old wakes up, screaming and sobbing because he can hear the movie that my husband left playing while he was passed out. I told him if he wants to watch scary movies he takes him to the garage or on the back porch.

I get pregnant again.

Covid hits.

He’s working from home during Covid and falls into a DEEP depression. Wouldn’t leave his office. Stopped showering. Drinking heavily at night. I’m trying my best to be supportive. I bought him new clothes, booked him a spa day after Covid ended, booked us two summer vacations.

After summer and the new baby came things were finally good. Our marriage still not God centered at all. We had may-August being GOOD and normal

So..we’re getting along. New baby is one month old.

Husbands little brother commits suicide. He goes into a depression. It’s bad this time. Credit card is getting maxed out on booze. He comes to me and says I need you to take the money over

November comes and his oldest brother over doses.

He is wrecked. Says I’m controlling for no letting him have the credit card

He’s on an antidepressant and drinking. He hates his life and has started lashing out on me.

Think arguments where he screams at me. He would punch the walls. He broke two of our dining chairs by picking them up and throwing them.

One time he picked up a broom and started beating the door with it in anger. Broke the broom.

He is now drinking so much he has urinated in our bed in his sleep and on the couch.

We go to my aunt’s for a weekend and he sneaks out of the house in the middle of the night to go drinking. My purse was in the car and it gets stolen. He’s angry at me for leaving my purse in the car and if it wasn’t for the purse being stolen, I never would’ve known he snuck out that night to go drink. He also urinated in the guest room bed from drinking so much that night.

I found him passed out on our garage floor one night using our sons bike as a pillow

Passed out on our back porch at night one time

I am not telling anyone anything because I am just trying to hold it together. I’m working full time and parenting two little kids and trying to maintain a home.

I asked him to get help

He said no.

Fast forward to my child’s first birthday. I find a prescription for Xanax. He’s clearly been on it given the coldness in his attitude and overall emptiness.

I break down. My mother in law is there I tell her everything.

Husband spends the birthday in withdrawal on the couch

In this time we do not have a healthy sex life. He gets angry when I don’t want it but I only want it if he’s nice to me. Is that wrong? He says he won’t be nice to me until I start putting out. We still only sleep in the same bed maybe once a week.

Fast forward a few months and he quits his job. We take this as an opportunity to go on a family vacation and it was good! Everyone comes back refreshed. But after a few weeks he’s moody and depressed because he can’t find a job. He finds one at a pharmacy. He’s up late taking tests or whatever. I’m currently working 8am to 9pm shifts while he’s getting things together…and I’m tired. I come

Home and the house is a mess… he won’t hug me, he gets mad when I come up behind him to hug him. He says don’t touch me. He had a long day with the kids.

I feel broken. Unloved. And hated.

I make a mistake and flirt with someone at work and I sleep with him.

I feel awful. My husband finds out, I confess to it.

We go to marriage counseling.

He goes to individual therapy as well.

We are trying. But then his therapist starts keeping

Him on virtual appointments until 11 sometimes 12 am. It’s weird. She’s not charging him for appointments.

He gets on a medication from her that helps him stay awake during the day. He’s distant and cold again. Says he doesn’t love me.

Our counselor tells us both the things we need to work on and I think things are going well. She tells

Him his situation with his own therapist is not healthy and he needs to find a new one- he doesn’t

We go out for a day with the kids in October and it was amazing. That same night I see text messages on his phone between him and his therapist from that same day- she’s telling him to leave me.

I break down and lose it

He tells me he’s done

He only married me because I was pregnant

He used to wish I wouldn’t come home at night so he could just have the baby to himself

I begged for him to stay

A few months later, after so many times of him saying he hates me, I’m worthless, and a lot of other mean things. I have a mental breakdown.

I was in the hospital

My husband is still talking to his therapist during this time and is telling her I am faking it and my hospital paperwork doesn’t even look real.

I am in such a low place right now. Losing weight, feeling awful, and just defeated. I start going to church

This helps, but doesn’t fix it. But I’m going twice a week by this point

After a month I want to take the kids. He tells me no, I’m not allowed to. That I’m now allowed to indoctrinate them.

After a few weeks I finally just take them. He hates it, but he enjoys the Sunday mornings alone more.

He’s still calling me names and telling me he hates me. He has now punched the back of my headboard while I was laying in bed. He picks up a pillow and starts hitting me with it. But he’s never put his hands on me.

By this point when he yells at me- the kids cry. They tell me they’re sorry daddy screams at me.

Sorry daddy is mean to you

This breaks me and I file for divorce. I can’t let my kids think this is normal. My family says my mental health is suffering and I need to leave him

During the divorce he comes home from work after the kids are in bed. Tells me the pharmacy is accusing him of stealing controlled substances and he walked out. To this day idk if he ever did it or didn’t.

He finds a new job working overnight. I adjust my work schedule so we don’t have to do daycare. He seems to like this job but after four months, he gets fired from this job.

On our wedding anniversary for the first time ever he asks if we can go to dinner or do something together. He texted me this question and I told him maybe not right now. Especially since the divorce paperwork was still in motion .To this day, I regret not saying yes because maybe things would’ve been different? I was just so hurt and scared and broken and didn’t know what to believe with him. Things had started to get into a pattern of him being mean and then saying he was sorry and then being mean again and saying sorry… I just didn’t know what was genuine and real.. He never asks me again to do something special.

Fast forward a few weeks he says let’s go back to marriage counseling. We do. After a few weeks I stop the divorce. My retainer check comes. We needed new car tires and house maintenance things. I purchase them. He’s mean to me again, I ask him why, he said ‘I thought we could work this out but I guess we can’t’

Our last marriage counseling session our counselor calls him mean and controlling and he says he’s never going back to counseling

I’m now in church twice a week and therapy once a week trying to rebuild myself and make the best of this roommate situation. We invite him to church. Sometimes he comes other times he laughs and makes fun of it.

Fourth of July I come home from work and he’s drunk. He throws a dish on the ground and starts screaming to call the police because he feels crazy. It’s awful and I lock myself in the bedroom with the kids. The kids are unphased. This absolutely breaks me because I’ve realized I’ve damaged my children and now they think this is OK and normal behavior. I feel like a failure is a parent. I feel like I’ve not protected them.

After this episode, he decides he’s going to quit drinking. He went to six AA meetings and it was really helping, but then he stopped going. To this day he has not had a drink of alcohol, but he is still the same cold person just now sober.

I truly believe if he kept going to AA, his personality would’ve changed and the program would’ve helped. But he had no desire to keep going saying that he doesn’t need it if he’s not drinking anymore.

Things continue on the same trajectory until Christmas. He’s working at a restaurant during this time and had to work on Christmas. Christmas night we get into an argument. He screams at me tells me he’s going to call the police and tell them that I hit him. I didn’t even come close to him. He never does-just full of empty threats.

January comes of 2025. I’m laying in bed one night and he comes in the room to get some things. I ask him if he really wants to give this another shot. He gets angry and tells me “ I don’t know how else I can explain it to you. I don’t love you. I don’t want you. I will be your roommate, and I will raise children with you. But I’ll also never leave you because I will not give you the satisfaction to tell people at church that your husband divorced you”

I say OK.

Later, he comes back in the room and says he’s sorry for being harsh and mean with me. I feel empty. But all I can think of is am I supposed to suffer like this? Jacob didn’t want to be married to Leah but she had to stay. Should I be staying?

I tried to tough it out for a month so I buy myself an exercise bike. I’m really excited to pick up a new healthy hobby. I am by no means overweight or in bad shape. But I just thought it would be a fun way to burn off steam. The first day I go in the garage to use it, my husband tells me “ I don’t know why you’re doing that because you’ll never be skinny enough to leave me” this crushes me because I have struggled with eating disorders and my weight for years. And the only reason he said this was to hurt my feelings. That is what hurt me the fact that I know he said it just to be mean to me. But all this time I keep thinking I deserve this treatment because I cheated on him. That I deserve every bit of this meanness. My therapist actually ends up being a Christian and tells me that I don’t deserve this but deep down it’s still hard for me to believe that.

From that point on I start thinking this marriage is unhealthy for my children. It’s unhealthy for me and I need to end it.

A few weeks later, I come home from church with the kids and as I open the door, he pushes me and storms outside screaming at me that the pictures I hung up in our bedroom need to come down (they were of farm animals from

Hobby lobby) and how dare I change anything in the house without consulting him. He tells me if I don’t then he’s going to throw all of my stuff away and burn our house down. It was really ugly and embarrassing because the neighbors can hear him. At this point, I’m afraid to touch or move anything in the house. There have been many times where he would get angry that I’d move the coffee pot to a different spot on the counter or put the vacuum in a different spot.

In May I go talk to a divorce lawyer and I get some paperwork drawn up. I come home and I leave it. I tell him we can do this amicably, and it won’t be expensive that I’m willing to share the kids 50-50 and I don’t want anything from him. Just let me buy him out of the house.

He’s not happy about it, but he’s also not arguing it. For him, the whole divorce was about money and he keeps wanting more and more from me. At one point I tell him that this is the deal. I’m willing to offer. It’s very fair even his lawyer has said that it’s fair and he would be silly not to take it. I told myself throughout the whole divorce process If he said, give me another chance stop or wanted to come to Jesus I would stop the process. He never once asked though.

During the divorce process, there were a few episodes where when I was leaving for work in the morning, he chased me out of the house and chased my car down the street screaming at me how he doesn’t love me and he hates me. There was one time where I couldn’t back out of the driveway because he was blocking me. And that moment his eyes were filled with so much hatred I really thought this man might kill me one day. Maybe that’s exaggerating, but it was the first time I really felt scared and I sobbed my whole drive to work.

July 2025 we signed papers and I’ve been legally divorced since. We no longer live together. And our children go back back-and-forth pretty easily. We don’t talk much. The first few months he would be really mean to me over texting or would ask me to come over and have sex with him-and I told him that if he wants any help from me, adjusting my schedule or helping him with picking up and dropping off he needs to be kind to me. Because he needs my help he’s actually been very amicable and polite to me and we’ve gotten along well.

But I feel absolutely crippled with guilt that my divorce ended under non-biblical terms. And it is absolutely crushing to me to think that I am not allowed to get married again or find a truly loving devoted partner. Yes, I know that I need to do some work on myself and really confide in the Lord and that is what I’m doing. But at the same time, I can’t even enjoy my life because I feel like I’m destined to now be alone forever and that’s so scary to me as I’m in my 30s and I just wanted a normal and boring marriage. And I hate the idea of growing old and being all by myself, and that scares me so much. And all I can keep thinking about that is if I did get remarried, I would just go to hell in the end anyways.

I know there were some things in my marriage that I did were wrong and I feel absolutely ridden with guilt over the adultery. Yes I know that the marriage was toxic before that event happened, but I still don’t feel like it excuses the behavior. I just feel so lost and so broken and so embarrassed. How could I even possibly bring this up to somebody in my church? Especially because now my husband legally has to take them to church on the Sundays that he has them if the children want to go. Church has done nothing for him and he still doesn’t like going, but he goes because the kids want to go. I pray for him still and I don’t even know if reconciliation would be biblically possible since we’ve both slept with other people. I just feel broken and unlovable and disgusting and it’s ruining anything value I have in myself or life.",2,1769800605.0,ChristianDating,2,1.0,False
1qrf0gh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrf0gh,The Trillion Dollar Rise of Embedded Finance. How every company you love is quietly becoming a fintech.,"TLDR - Check out the attached short presentation.

Embedded finance is the integration of financial services like lending, payment processing, or insurance into non-financial infrastructures without the need to redirect to traditional financial institutions. It is why you can pay for an Uber in the app or finance a Peloton at checkout. It is a shift from banking as a place you go, to banking as a thing you do. The market is projected to hit over $800 billion by 2034.

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in how money moves. Historically, if you wanted a loan, you went to a bank. If you wanted insurance, you called a broker. If you wanted to invest, you called a stockbroker.

Today, you get a loan at the checkout of an online store. You buy travel insurance the moment you book a flight. You invest your spare change through a rounding-up feature on your coffee app.

This is Embedded Finance. It is the decoupling of financial services from traditional financial institutions and the reintegration of those services into the software and products you use every day.

Here is the comprehensive guide to how it works, who is driving it, and where it is going.

**The Core Concept** Embedded finance is the placement of a financial product in a non-financial customer experience, journey, or platform.

To understand the scale of this, look at the buy now, pay later (BNPL) explosion. This is technically a third-party loan, but to the consumer, it feels like a simple payment option. The friction of applying for credit is removed entirely.

The goal is to stop treating banking as a separate destination and start treating it as a utility that exists exactly where the customer needs it.

**Why Is This Happening Now?** There are four massive macroeconomic and technological shifts driving this:

1. **The API Revolution:** Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow different software to talk to each other. This allows a bank to open its infrastructure to a retailer.
2. **The Death of Brand Loyalty in Banking:** Millennials and Gen Z are less likely to stay with a legacy bank out of obligation. They prioritize convenience and user experience (UX) over institutional history.
3. **Data Richness:** A company like Amazon or Uber knows more about your spending habits than your local bank branch does. They can use this data to underwrite loans or offer products with better accuracy than a credit score.
4. **The E-Commerce Default:** As commerce moves almost entirely online, the payment layer had to become invisible to reduce cart abandonment.

**The Ecosystem: Who Is Involved?** The industry is generally split into three layers. Understanding this hierarchy is key to understanding the business model.

**1. The Technology Providers (The Pipes)** These are the companies building the infrastructure. They provide the APIs and cloud platforms that connect the banks to the apps.

* *Examples:* Stripe, Marqeta, Synapse.
* *Role:* They strip away the complexity of compliance and coding, allowing a retail company to offer banking products without hiring 500 compliance officers.

**2. The Balance Sheet Firms (The Vaults)** These are the licensed, regulated institutions. They hold the money, manage the risk, and deal with the regulatory headaches.

* *Examples:* Traditional banks (Goldman Sachs via transaction banking), Charter banks, and specialized fintech banks.
* *Role:* They rent out their banking license to the tech providers or distributors.

**3. The Distributors (The Face)** These are the consumer-facing brands you know. They own the customer relationship.

* *Examples:* Shopify, Uber, Walmart, Apple.
* *Role:* They integrate the financial product into their user interface to increase retention and revenue.

**The Five Pillars of Embedded Finance** Embedded finance is not just one thing. It generally falls into five specific categories.

**1. Embedded Payments** The most mature sector. This is the ability to pay without pulling out a card or entering data.

* *Example:* When you exit an Uber, you do not physically pay. The payment happens in the background. Starbucks allows you to load money and pay via app, essentially holding customer deposits like a bank.

**2. Embedded Lending** Credit offered at the point of sale.

* *Example:* Klarna or Afterpay at a clothing retailer’s checkout. It increases conversion rates for retailers and gives consumers instant liquidity.

**3. Embedded Banking** Non-financial companies offering checking accounts or debit cards.

* *Example:* Shopify Balance offers merchants a business account to hold their revenue, bypassing traditional business banking fees and delays.

**4. Embedded Insurance** Insurance offered exactly when the risk is created.

* *Example:* Tesla offering insurance based on real-time driving data. Airlines offering trip protection during the checkout flow.

**5. Embedded Investing** API-driven investment access.

* *Example:* Acorns rounding up your purchases to invest the difference. Cash App allowing stock trading alongside peer-to-peer payments.

**The Upside** **For the Consumer:** Convenience. You do not have to leave the app to get the money you need. It also creates financial inclusion for the underbanked, who may be intimidated by traditional bank branches but are comfortable using a smartphone.

**For the Business:** Sticky ecosystems. If Shopify holds your money, processes your payments, and gives you a loan, you are never leaving Shopify. It increases Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).

**The Downside: The Risks Involved** It is not all positive. There are significant behavioral and systemic risks.

* **The Debt Trap:** By making borrowing frictionless (one-click loans), consumers can easily overextend themselves without realizing the weight of the debt.
* **Privacy Erosion:** Combining your purchase history with your banking history gives corporations a terrifyingly complete picture of your life.
* **Regulatory Nightmares:** Who is responsible when things go wrong? The app? The tech provider? The bank? As the supply chain fragments, accountability can get lost.

**Embedded Finance vs. Open Banking vs. DeFi** These terms get confused often. Here is the distinction:

* **Open Banking:** Banks letting third parties view your data (with permission) to give you better advice or tools.
* **DeFi (Decentralized Finance):** Using blockchain to remove the central authority entirely.
* **Embedded Finance:** Using central authorities (banks) but hiding them behind non-financial interfaces.

**The Future Market** The numbers are staggering. Global Market Insights valued the market at $104 billion in 2024, with projections hitting over $834 billion by 2034.

We are moving toward a world where every company will be a fintech company. The future of finance is not a bank on a corner; it is code in the background of everything you do.

One of my casual female friends tried to set me up with her brother (36-37M? I don't know his exact age).

I told her I was coming out of a domestic violence situation in late November and she told me that her brother often asks about me (I only met him once but I was like dang okay, I guess I made some sort of impression - I also thought he was super cute too and smart). Even though I was a bit numb from my last relationship (I thought my last partner was \*the one\* until it all went south), I agree and so he messaged me in late December around Christmas and I told him I'd love to hang out post-holidays when things settle.

We had some minor, flirty, consistent texting in early January on Instagram. We talked about meeting up again and he asked when I was free but then I got slammed starting a new job (70-hour weeks) and got sick, so I didn’t reply for \~2-3-ish weeks. I finally replied to say hey here's my number just contact me there because I clearly dropped the ball on Insta and he sent me a long text that was like

>""Sorry I’ve been slow to reach out today; I’ve never really found myself in this situation before, so I’m not quite sure how to approach this (trying to thread the needle between over and under-sharing) but the short version is that over the last month or so I’ve kind of gotten myself in a bit of a situationship with an ex. We’re not officially together, or exclusive per se, but I wouldn’t feel right going on a date with anybody else right now. I’m really sorry! If something changes, I can let you know. (I feel the need to be honest about what I can offer at the moment 😅) Would definitely love to still meet up as friends though! (If you’re open to that!)""

I replied with a firm boundary:

>“Thanks for letting me know. If you’re fully single, feel free to reach out. Until then, take care.”

I texted his sister to tell her thank you and she said,

>""I'm sure he'd love to get still get to know you as a friend even if not a dating capacity at the moment! Would you want to do lunch or get coffee the three of us?! He comes out to see me for coffee and lunch often! I'd absolutely love to see you either way!""

My pour overs are not very good lately. The coffee is not terrible but also not very good. I even find it hard to describe; there is often a very bright acidity in the very beginning especially when the coffee is still very hot. It gets better when its a little cooler but there is still not hardly as much flavour as the coffee could have. Often little complexity.

A few days ago i poured a little (maybe 20ml) of cold water into the brew. The difference was stunning. No unpleasant acidity no bitterness very complex taste fruity and sweet notes. I wonder why that is and hoe i can get the initial brew to taste the same.

1qrewem,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstatePlanning/comments/1qrewem/my_parents_went_to_a_trust_mill_help_me_please/,My parents went to a trust mill… help me please,"Texas. 

My parents (78/72) attended some online seminar and signed up for a $700 trust setup.

I'm sorry for the novel, TLDR : I have no clue the overall value of my parents estate. In includes annuities, real estate, social security, government pension and regular pension. I asked my dad what his NW was and he said he didn't know (uhh shouldn't you know) and threw out 800K, but was telling me ""made"" 80K last year.

How can I:

1. Accept that they are doing it this way, which seems like just a way to cross something off their list / not get personalized help for their specific concerns. Is ""fine"" good enough?

2. Convince them it's a bad idea. They COULD spend the 2-6K I see it could cost to work with an elder law lawyer.

My (39) husband and I have been working on retirement plans and after watching my parents deal with the death of my maternal grandfather (96). There was so much drama with moms siblings, my grandparents doing weird things with money and waiting too long to get the care they needed because they were scared of running out of money (from what I can tell, they definitely had ""enough"" but lived in scarcity. My grandma (93) is alive and in good health considering her age.

It's been almost a year since his passing, and I very politely have over the last few months hinted my parents should really figure out a bunch of things. They have a will that basically says surviving parent gets it all, then on their passing my sister and I split everything 50/50.

I think running out of money is of course a concern - we have the same struggles. Because of algorithms, I see people ""shielding"" their money from nursing homes. I told my parents it would be worth looking into if it's something they are concerned with. I want them to have options. If their is a 5 year look back why not start that clock now?

How long can what they have carry them in assisted living or advanced care. Would they want to live at a ""nice place"" until the money runs out then move to a less nice place if they have to? Would they rather adjust their current lifestyle to bolster their finances. No mortgage no debt.

My dad mentioned something about buying an annuity and I started asking questions and every question was answered with a very ""sales"" pitch answer from him almost as a direct quote from the person he bought it from. I know he bought it and at some point he told me he only invested a small percentage of the original number he through out.

I don't know enough about all that but it just reads at the very least as too good to be true.

My parents are not planners - and it's been fine for their whole life. But I watched the tension in their over 50 year marriage because my grandparents didn't plan enough - or communicate what their plans were.. I watched the siblings bicker over not sending my grandparents into assisted living .5 miles from us because ""they don't have the money"" but I was watching my parents especially my mom, manage it all with a few days/ weeks of respite a year because most her siblings (5 live all over the country). My grandparents lived with my parents.

I do not want that for my sister (lives across the country). I don't want to argue with my husband over something that could be talked about before hand, nor do I want my time to grieve to be overwhelming because of drama. But I also realize, I am the child in the situation.

I pressed a little more about looking into elder law and trusts and when my dad said ""We will get to it"" I asked ""well when"" and I'm over at his house yesterday and he tells me he signed up for a seminar and spewed the most sales pitch things I have ever heard.

The most concerning is that all trusts now days are boilerplate and ""you only need lawyers if you are merging Ford and Chevy"" and ""if you use a lawyer they will make you pull your deed, but we do that for you"" and ""if you use a local lawyer and you want to change anything or change lawyers you have to start all over because they all use their own software and how much its gonna cost.""

Every time I asked a simple question, my parents doubled down and were getting more frustrated. Which to me is exactly how my grandparents acted. I live nearby so I heard a lot of all this.

My dad has told me thousands of time ""I never want to treat you and your sibling and spouses like how grandma/grandpa are treating your mother and I"" - and the sad part is they are not doing anything to prevent this.

My parents both think they are just gonna be 10000% fine and then die. They don't think they are going to need any help or care. And I hope that is how it works for them - but do they at any point want to live with us? If so, after seeing what they went through, we would set up things to know when it's time to hire help, or go to assisted living or skilled nursing. I've asked if my parents stay close would they want me to stop by daily for coffee... or 1x a week for dinner or any time we leave the house just pick em for a ride ( would impact the next vehicle we purchase). I know they do not want to be a burden.

As you can probably see, I'm overwhelmed but what-ifs. I have a child too and we are working on our own set of documentation to make sure if we die young it's laid out. I can't imagine not doing work to make sure can they grieve instead of figuring it all out.

The idea was to let the enzymes theoretically convert starches to sugars, proteins to amino acids, and fats into smaller lipids, allowing for a finer and more complete extraction without the physical limitations of conventional grinding. As a result, the coffee was remarkably smooth with magnitudes less bitterness and a more pronounced acidity. The bottom of the cup had no grittiness and coated the tongue like chocolate ganache.

So, summer of 2023 the guy I'd been dating for 2 years started an LDR behind my back. Every date with her took 20x the travel a date with me takes, and that's been driving me insane, trying to figure out why this other person was worth 20x what I am. He only saw her 4x total. Other than actually seeing her? It was texting. Never phone calls, never video chats - texting. He did end up sharing a few of their text exchanges after and I put some actual tone into her side of them based on my interactions with her and he went ""oh"". Like it had never occurred to him that she was just digging the text attention and didn't actually give a fuck. I sat on the couch next to him and told him we needed to have a similar text conversation to what they had with me sitting right next to him. We did. He couldn't believe how often I put my phone down, switched to different apps, different text threads, yet it still appeared from his side that all of my attention was on him. I even managed to make it extremely creatively dirty for him without a single thought or change in my behavior. He thought I was just doing that to make a point and I told him ""no, I'm just doing this naturally. You do realize that when you and I met I was casually texting with 5 other men, right? I politely told them all that I'd had a great first date with you and that I'd let them know if it didn't work out?"" He had no idea. Completely clueless. Thought I'd been focused solely on him the entire time. Didn't realize that the only reason I knew which guy I was even meeting up with that date was because I'd double checked his name right before walking into the coffee shop. AP, after my conversations with her, is the same but has active sexual relationships that she lies to them all about being monogamous (showed him those texts - she was assuming he and I would never speak again, I think).

Why is this bothering me so much? Other than a break after D-day (which was about 4 months into their 7 month relationship) that ended as soon as he ended it with her, we've seen each other every single weekend other than a few ""I fucking hate you"" situations, he's spent several weeks by my side in the hospital while I've been dealing with brain surgeries...

But every date with her was worth 20 with me. Like, just dates, not any of the other stuff. It's like the other stuff doesn't count because I'm not talking about that stuff, I'm talking about the fact that it took 20x the effort just to kiss her. He keeps telling me she wasn't, that it was a massive waste. But he was coming up with these ""hey, can I come over this weekend"" trips to see her then coming up with excuses for me on the fly. Never, ever has he come up with any ""hey, let's go on a long trip!"" dates with me. Shit, he's never even ""hey, can I come down and eat that delicious pussy after work tonight?"" for me! I've met her, I've talked to her... I'm so much better looking, overall just a better person (by far), if anyone deserves the 1200 miles of driving for one date, the ""on the fly"" ""hey sexy, I wanna see you right now"" messages IT'S ME NOT HER!! But he doesn't seem to have anything to say about that stuff other than ""it was just because she lived so far away, it didn't have anything to do with value"". But to me - that's a huge sign of someone's value. 

He and I live 30 miles apart. She lives 600 miles away.

I suggested some trips that are equal the distance that we could do together. At first, he was calling then wastes of time and gas. Now, he's kinda on board - which doesn't feel good at all because when it was her, it was not only his own doing (literally ""hey, can I come visit you this weekend?"") vs for me he's caving after years of fighting. For reference, we are in Seattle. He was driving to Boise to see her. One of the trips I came up with was to drive down 101 to the Redwoods - one of the drive through trees is just about 600 miles that way. Drive around, check out some of the trails, get some pictures, then come back. He thought that was the most stupid idea. I've been wanting to do it for years but never had anyone to do it with, he never seemed like the type. Now, I know that he's capable and does enjoy doing these things - but only for her, it seems. He's finally caved, which doesn't even feel good because he's not doing it of his own desire, he's doing it because I yelled and cried so much.

What the fuck am I supposed to do?!",1,1769799983.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,1,0.67,False

Background: I’m 26 years old and otherwise healthy. About two years ago I wore a Holter monitor that only showed a few palpitations, and my cardiologist felt no further workup was needed.

Fast forward to May 2025, I woke up in AFib for the first time. At that point I hadn’t had alcohol for over a week, didn’t use nicotine or caffeine, and was well hydrated. I went to the ER and was discharged on metoprolol and Eliquis since my heart rate was relatively low but the rhythm was irregular. I stayed in AFib for about 50 to 60 hours and then converted on my own. I followed up with cardiology and EP, and since it was considered idiopathic, they advised no ablation and told me to return to normal life.

Last week, after months of feeling fine and living normally with occasional weekend drinking and rare Zyn use, I woke up again in AFib. There were no warning signs, no heavy alcohol use, and nothing out of the ordinary. My cardiologist restarted metoprolol and Eliquis and added flecainide. Once again, I converted on my own after about 50 to 60 hours.

I’ve now been in sinus rhythm for about a week, but I’m feeling pretty stuck. My cardiologist is focused almost entirely on ruling out sleep apnea and has ordered a sleep study, which I will complete, but I honestly don’t think this is the trigger. They do not seem interested in discussing other possible causes or long term strategies, and the overall response has been that I am young and should not worry.

I work in healthcare and am aspiring to become a physician, and the idea of having unpredictable AFib episodes long term is unsettling. Because of that, I am considering pursuing ablation earlier rather than later.

Right now, I also do not know how cautious I need to be. I have not been given clear guidance on whether I can resume normal activities such as occasional alcohol, working out, or even a cup of coffee, especially while taking metoprolol, Eliquis, and flecainide.

Also should mention I feel super aware of all my chest wall at this point. The anxiety of it all is almost worse than when I’m actually in AFIB. I’ve been hyper conscious of my own HR for years and this just adds fuel to the flame.

TLDR

26 year old with two AFib episodes occurring during sleep or upon waking, each lasting about 50 to 60 hours and converting spontaneously. No obvious triggers identified. Sleep apnea is being evaluated but feels unlikely. Cardiologist has not been very helpful. Unsure if I can safely return to normal life including exercise and occasional alcohol or caffeine, and wondering if early ablation is worth pursuing.

The dream begins with me traveling on a train through my city's capital. The roof overlooked an arctic region, covered in ice and snow, where strange animals were descending. The temperature was indicated by a meter on the wall connected to a radio.

The train itself was also curious, as despite the landscape, it was raining through the windows, and I could see the tracks below through several holes.

Suddenly, I see an ex-friend (J) of mine board, so I quickly forget what I was doing to talk to him.

J doesn't even pay attention to me; he's barely surprised to see me, and I notice he's more uncomfortable than anything else. Then, I see him get off the train a couple of stops before mine, and I decide to follow him.

He's walking towards a gym, and I try to start conversations, which he only answers curtly or occasionally with enthusiasm, as if there were still a glimmer of chemistry between us.

When we arrive at the building, we enter a large room that leads to a door to the machines. I'm still following him, but then he stops me and draws a blue line that stands out against the red, saying, ""Visitors only. Stay here if you want."" He then leaves with his trainer while I go to sit in the back.

Hours pass, and I don't see him, so I try to strike up a conversation with a group of girls next to me (who are dressed like the Demons, no joke).

The girls show their disgust, since they seem to know me, and start talking about my personal life and showing me screenshots of my past pornography addiction while calling me repulsive and disgusting.

So, I leave and head to a nearby plaza, where I see a children's playground with sand, and decide to sit down while I tear up a little.

  
At this moment, completely alone, a policeman appears, a rather large man with a mustache who laughs.

""You're here again?"" he asks. ""Do you know me?"" I reply, ""Of course, it's not the first time you've come, I already have a record of you,"" he replies as he sits down next to me, giving me a little hug.



Then he says,

""That's life, you can never get rid of your past, it will always haunt you, but that's not a bad thing, it means you still have a long way to go. You shouldn't be here crying, you should be on the train.""

With that, he helps me up, gives me a coffee, and points to the station.

I just walk, watching as the rain starts again.

You scanned the room, hesitated, then chose the empty chair two tables away instead of joining the loud group. No forced small talk, no awkward wave. Just quiet. After a while our eyes met over the rim of our cups and we both gave that tiny, almost invisible nod the one introverts use instead of words. Neither of us moved closer that night.

Here's what actually worked for a legit European adventure (spent 3 weeks in Eastern Europe for under $1200) 🌍,"I'm calling it: I spent three weeks navigating Eastern Europe for under $1200, and my biggest ""trap"" wasn't a tourist scam, but the sheer expectation built by glossy travel feeds. You know, the ones promising 'unforgettable' moments in 'hidden gems' that cost a fortune and end up crowded anyway. My trip was different.

Instead of hunting for the next viral photo op, I was focused on local markets, slow train rides, and conversations with people who genuinely lived there. And yeah, it meant a lukewarm shower sometimes, a few wrong turns, and eating a lot of bread, but it also meant 21 days of legitimate adventure without breaking the bank.

Here’s the real talk on how I pulled off a legit 3-week Eastern European trip for under $1200 (not including major international flights, but covering all in-region travel, food, lodging, and activities).

### **The Breakdown: Where the Money (and Time) Went**

My route largely covered parts of **Romania (Bucharest, Brașov)** and **Bulgaria (Sofia, Plovdiv)**. I traveled during late spring/early summer, which meant good weather but also the start of peak season in some spots.

*   **Accommodation: ~$400 (Avg. $19/night)**
    *   Mostly hostels (dorm rooms). I always checked reviews for cleanliness and central location.
    *   *Example:* A solid hostel bed in Bucharest or Sofia often ran about €15-€20. I splurged on one private room for two nights in Plovdiv for €30/night, just to get a break.
    *   **Pro-tip:** Look for hostels with kitchens. Cooking even one meal a day significantly cuts costs.
*   **Food: ~$300 (Avg. $14/day)**
    *   This was a mix of supermarket groceries, street food, local bakeries, and very occasional sit-down meals.
    *   *Example:* A pastry and coffee for breakfast might be €2-3. A hearty lunch from a local canteen or market stall could be €5-7. Dinner involved a lot of bread, cheese, tomatoes, and local fruit from open-air markets.
    *   **Reality check:** This isn't fine dining. It's fueling up on local, fresh ingredients.
*   **Transportation (in-region): ~$200**
    *   **Buses are your best friend.** Long-distance intercity buses (e.g., Bucharest to Sofia) cost around €25-€40 and often provided decent wifi. They're slower than flying but save a ton of money and let you see the landscape.
    *   Local public transport (trams, metro) was cheap, often €1-€2 per ride. I walked a *lot*.
    *   **What I avoided:** Taxis unless absolutely necessary (like a very early airport run). Ride-sharing apps were sometimes an option but not always the cheapest.
*   **Activities & Miscellaneous: ~$250**
    *   Free walking tours were my go-to in every city. They’re a fantastic way to get oriented and learn history, just remember to tip your guide.
    *   Museum entries were usually affordable (€5-€10). I picked a few key ones rather than trying to see everything.
    *   Hiking in national parks (like around Brașov) was free.
    *   This also covered things like a SIM card for local data, laundry, and a few souvenirs.

### **The Honest Truth: It Wasn't Always Glamorous**

*   **Long Journeys:** Those overnight buses save on accommodation, but you arrive tired. It's not a luxury sleeper train.
*   **Language Barriers:** While English is widely spoken in tourist areas, venturing slightly off the beaten path often requires patience and Google Translate. Learning a few basic phrases (hello, thank you, please, how much) went a long way.
*   **Packing Light is Non-Negotiable:** Hauling a huge suitcase on and off public transport, up hostel stairs, and across cobblestones will exhaust you. A good quality travel backpack (40-50L) is key.
*   **Weather Can Be Unpredictable:** Even in late spring, I encountered both scorching heatwaves and unexpected rain. Layers are crucial.
*   **""Instagrammable"" Moments?** Sometimes they happened naturally, sometimes they didn't. The real magic was in the unexpected conversations, the taste of a truly fresh pastry, or stumbling upon a quiet street musician, not in perfectly staged photos.

This kind of travel isn't about ticking off a bucket list; it's about genuine discovery, learning to be resourceful, and embracing the imperfect beauty of a place. It's about trading convenience for experience.

**Rylen, the every day man.**



The sun lazily drifted through in rays dancing across the particles of dust that scattered through the air in his room. An alarm began to sound, 7:30 a.m. His phone was set quite loud as it always was, since he could never quite properly wake up otherwise. With an annoyed grunt, he turned over and moved his finger in some robotic manner until he finally managed to tap the snooze option. In a half asleep satisfaction, he brought his pillow in closer and slowly drifted off to sleep once more. Five minutes later, another alarm. 7:35 a.m. Once more, the alarm rang for a few seconds until he unconsciously hit the snooze button again, the usual morning cycle. This continued in a rhythmic battle between man and phone until the phone alarm began it’s final threatening alarm. 7:55 a.m. This time, Rylen finally shot up and groggily rubbed his eyes. The slow filtering ray of the sun had gotten just a little brighter. One foot after another, he put his feet on the ground and stood, a yawn and a stretch following suit. He pulled the curtain aside just slightly to get a look at the weather of the day, sunny and warm as it always was in Florida. Rolling his eyes, he let the curtain drift back into place and made with his slow daily preparations. Once teeth were brushed and his casual office attire were on, he glanced at himself in the mirror. In his reflection, stared back the deadened eyes of a 26 year old man who never thought this would be his life.



Slowly, he made his way downstairs and assembled his usual breakfast of three slices of toast while he hit the startup button on his coffee maker, the machine instantly whirring to life. He had always prepared a filter with ground up beans every night before bed so all he had to do in the mornings was start it. This was one of the small little satisfactions in his life that brought just the slightest tinge of joy before he had to go to work. As he waited for the coffee to brew, he began buttering his toast. It was a simple flavor, but one that was his favorite. The simple salty dairy spread upon his bread was a classic that just couldn’t be defeated. Finally, as he finished buttering the final slice he began crunching on the toast just over the sink as the brew still filled. He slowly scrolled through his phone during this time, taking in all the barely news of whatever came across his feed overnight.   
  
“Surely it can’t be healthy to be scrolling this thing so early in the morning…”  
  
 Rylen thought to himself. Regardless, he did so. Several minutes later, the brew finished and he had enjoyed his early morning coffee before grabbing his lunch bag from the fridge and throwing his shoes on. He grabbed a standard red tie and once again looked into the mirror that hung just in front of him upon his closed closet door. His barely grown brown stubble contrasted nicely from the sides of his evenly trimmed head before the top edges met with a somewhat maintained flat mohawk that he wasn’t so sure that he was fond of or not. Placing his hand upon the door handle, he takes a quick final look around at his apartment and sighs.   
  
“See you tonight.”  
  
The commute to work was the same as it always was, a certain kind of traffic hell that would make any man less patient want to swerve into his fellow man just for existing. The radio droned on in the background about something that Rylen didn’t care about in particular, if not playing the same five or six songs in a row that he could have sworn he’d hear playing in the back of his head every so often even outside of the car. With a sigh, he watched as two other idiots screamed at each other on the side of the road about scraping their cars together. Surely one would blame the other or point fingers, but in this state it was more than likely that both men were at fault. Every driver going past would obviously have to slow down and take a look, because on the arteries of the city each little event on the side of the road is a big spectacle to all. Rylen looked at the clock inside of his car. 8:22 a.m. He wouldn’t be late by any means, but it would mean that by the time he arrives he’ll be getting some sarcastic comment from one of the older coworkers in his office. It was the same comment he’d heard any other time that he strolled in 10 minutes to the start of his shift. “Well good afternoon to you too part-timer.” A corny attempt to be funny that he would have to pretend was indeed, though that facade was getting harder and harder to maintain as he got older. Finally, he pulled up to the lot of the 15 story building he worked in. The company sign just barely sun-faded on the front of the all brick architecture.  
  
Wearily, he pulled into his usual parking spot which was right near the entrance of the parking lot. Rylen liked to get out of work as soon as possible and for some reason this spot was always open. Perhaps it was that other people were more motivated than he, however the likeliest case would be that everyone else was just too damn lazy to walk more than the required 20 or so feet from the front entrance. This would be understandable considering that everyone he worked with was in their late thirties or older, it had been forever since he had actually seen someone his own age -let alone conversed with them. Opening the door, Tamara the front desk receptionist greeted him with the usual “Good morning!” That she usually did. She was probably the one person in a day that he put forth the most effort not to greet in a dreary way. Not out of romantic interest or anything, but that she was the most cheerful person there and he’d be damned to be the one to turn the corner of her mouth down in any kind of way. Closing the door behind himself he made a slow turn in order to correct his expression before it was complete and he was facing her again.   
  
“Good morning Tamara.”  
  
 It was quite possible that the corners of his mouth twitched a little too violently during that statement, but regardless there was no indication that she’d been displeased. Good.  
  
As he strolled into the office, the first thing that hit him was the same musty scent of slightly old piping that wrapped around the brick walls of the office. It was a scent he had gotten used to at this point and was indeed rather indifferent about. Sitting down at his computer, with the quickest little breath he bent forward and entered his password. The office computer gave it’s cheery little ‘bing-bing’ just slightly too loud. Embarrassed, he looked around to see if anyone was staring at him. “Guess we’re all a little tired today…” He thought to himself. With a couple of clicks, his screen was once again filled with spreadsheets. An image that would be inhabiting the rest of his day.   
  
**Chapter Two:**

**A glitch in the system.**

  
Two hours passed by while Rylen kept his head on the computer screen, correcting error after error from idiot accountants too hasty to submit their endless list of forms and financial audits. By now, it was officially break time or for him, time to go and hit up the coffee maker here at the office. Upon returning and sitting in his chair again, he glanced the screen over one more time to see if he himself had made any errors. Suddenly, he noticed something. On the bottom left corner of the screen was a strange marking he had never seen before. Curiously, he tried clicking and holding the mouse over it to see if he could copy paste the little symbol. In his attempts however, it would not highlight. His eyebrows scrunched together as he stared at it, what appeared to be a circle with lines following the same pattern inch by inch into itself almost as if a bullseye, only…this wasn’t that. As he continued to click on it again and again, his computer froze entirely. He let go of the mouse, sitting back in his chair a little bit and sighing.   
  
“The damn thing stopped working on me again, and I don’t really want to go and talk to Jared about anything with his usual monday attitude…”  
  
 As he stared up at the roof, recollecting the little bit of patience he had within himself for computers, he finally looked back down at the screen.  
  
On the screen now, was a video interface much like that of skype. Odd, considering no one uses that platform anymore. Much less himself. Rylen didn’t remember typing in skype or even having a skype icon downloaded to his homescreen for quick access, yet here in front of him clear as day was a skype call with an unknown caller. The symbol of the other participant was the exact same as that of the little symbol in the corner of his screen just a few seconds ago. Slowly, he squinted in confusion at the caller before reaching to a headset mounted on his tower and placing it over his ears.   
  
“Hel…lo?”  
  
 He slowly called into the mic. The other side went quiet for a moment before the icon on screen lit up, a slightly higher pitched female voice awaited him on the other side.   
  
“It’s boring, isn’t it?”  
  
 Rylen paused for a moment, the cogs in his mind spinning but unable to catch on to whoever it is that was currently speaking to him on the other side of the screen.   
  
“I-...I’m sorry? Who is this?”  
  
 He says, another delayed response and a few seconds more of silence. Again, the voice finally speaks up.   
“You live the same day, every day. It’s boring, isn’t it?”  
  
Whoever she was, it was as if she was both patient and impatient at the same time as if the answer to the question should have been answered and they both knew what exactly that answer was.  
  
“Miss I don’t- Who am I speaking to right now? Could I have your name please?”  
  
 He spoke again into the microphone, pressing for an answer himself that he definitely didn’t share with her. This time the response was more immediate.   
  
“You’ll know in due time, when you have to.”  
  
 Before he could speak again, a bright light began to slowly shine from the symbol on screen, more and more it flashed far more brilliantly than a computer screen should have been able to ever put off. Rylen covered his eyes, grunting at the pure white in front of him.   
  
“The fuck is happening right now…”  
  
 His hands tried to cover the mini-sun that had now formed in front of him, though they provided very little relief. All at once as the brightness reached it’s peak, suddenly there was darkness and a brief pulling feeling as he could feel himself moving through an unknown space, the sensations around him indescribable as if time and space flowed around him. The feeling of the office chair slowly dissipated underneath him as all at once without even making the movements of his own muscles he felt as if he both sat and stood in the same moment before standing all at once. He was now in a dark void of sorts, a room that seemed to stretch on forever into nothing. The only light, the glowing golden form before him.  
  
As his eyes re-adjusted to the almost oppressing darkness of the void, the golden form began to speak.   
  
“You have been dragged from almost impossibly afar, Rylen. Take a moment and make sure you may look upon me properly.”  
  
 Being this close to her, the voice was still high-pitched but not as high as it sounded through the speakers of his headset. There was commanding intention behind it, a power that commanded the entirety of the space they shared. Rylen continued to rub his eyes, parsing the thoughts behind them. He had never been one for poetry in the past, nor was he any good at trying to find partners or anything of that sort so for him to be thinking in this kind of manner…the whole damn thing felt like a dream. It must be. As his senses came slightly to bear more and more, he was finally able to look up at the golden form before him. She was massive, not in body weight or any metric but…if it were to be a building that had stood before him, surely he would be standing in downtown New York by now. The further back he had to tilt his head, the wider his eyes became before finally he saw the face atop the figure. There were no words that came to mind immediately other than “Beautiful.”  
  
The figure may have sensed his thoughts, but if she did then surely she was just as disinterested as any other woman he’d talked to in the past.   
  
“Now you are able to finally look upon me, so I may converse with you, Rylen. You are a human man from the planet known as Earth, correct?”  
  
 Rylen continued to look up, absolutely baffled.   
  
“Y-yes…ma’am, miss? I am uh…indeed from…”  
  
 He paused for a moment as his mind tried to comprehend every little fiber of whatever he could glean mentally and physically. “-Earth.” Does this mean that he was pulled god knows how far to wherever and now was standing in front of an alien? Although, the one in front of him definitely bore every feature of a human being. She continued to speak.   
  
“This of course, I already knew. Otherwise you simply wouldn’t be here, I don’t choose wrong.” There was power behind that ‘Don’t’. After a few seconds of silence, she began speaking again. “You have been brought here before me, Rylen, because I have chosen you to be my instrument.”   
  


Rylen paused for a moment, crossing his arms as he sat in thought upon her words. It was odd to hear such a statement of importance being spoken over himself as if he were any more than some basic office worker. He attempted to look up the impossibly long distance between himself and the eyes of the goddess, hoping that he was somehow making the necessary contact.   
  
“I am sorry…ma’am? But I am no more than a simple desk jockey, a guy who works at computers for a living. I don’t think there is anything about me that would be able to become an instrument of any kind for someone so…important I’d assume.”  
  
 At this, the goddess only stared at him in quiet contemplation again, though he wasn’t so certain that someone like her would have anything to contemplate. That word indicated uncertainty, and she definitely hasn’t shown that kind of trait so far.   
  
“I am aware of your status back home, Rylen. You possess skills no more potent than to type at the keys of some electrical device and make it’s glass change whatever shine it displays before you.”   
  
He winced internally at the fact she knew so many details about himself that he considered to be pathetic before he ever brought them up towards her. If she knew this much, what else would she have known? Could she have been spying on him his whole life? The thought sent a small shiver up his back. If it were through his own eyes that she had watched, it wouldn’t be so fine to know but to think that she had a whole overhead view of his day to day affairs…that thought didn’t sit so comfortably within his chest either.  
  
“You wonder how it is that I know so much of you before we’d even properly acquainted, is this correct?” She said, her eyes not even bothering to narrow where he could feel they definitely would have. Damn it, she was in his mind for sure.  
  
“That…is something I am wondering, yes ma’am.” He replied, his shoulders sinking slightly as if a child being scolded by his own mother. The goddess continued to look him over in silence for a moment as the void space around them continued to reverberate in endless shimmering nothings.  
  
“I see all who fall within my interest, Rylen.” An answer that brought no reassurance whatsoever, she continued on. “You are a regular human possessing no powers whatsoever, this is why I shall grant you a gift.” Upon finishing that sentence, a string of floating differently colored flames appeared just before him. From left to right, the small little dancing embers shone various shades of Blue, Red, Green, Black, and Yellow. Rylen looked them over in confusion, extending his hand outwards and waving slightly through each illusion. To his almost disappointment, not a single one of the embers gave off any heat.   
  
“Before you are differently colored essences. The mana that flows through the people that inhabit my world. Each one granting a different strength and weakness.” The goddess spoke, matter-of-factly as if this should have been common knowledge to anyone.  
  
“Like…as in different teams of dodgeball?” Rylen replied, though with a sarcasm he hadn’t intended to bring across. He found himself stiffening slightly as he regretted the choice in words. To his surprise however, the goddess before him regarded his response with no impatience.   
  
“If it were summed up so easily, human of earth, then yes. It is almost as if the people of my world have been arranged into teams much like the recreational games of your world.”  
  
A response that told Rylen that yes, the sarcasm was noted and promptly discarded. He’d have to give himself a slap in the head for that later. But how was one to reply to a living skyscraper if not than to establish friendship of some kind, otherwise perhaps they would be smited for simply getting in the way of such a tall and powerful being. The goddess continued to explain  
  
“These colors are not based on elements, as I can sense that you have taken it. Rather, the mana that one is imbued with is based upon the character of a soul. Within the womb, a developing soul is judged to be happy or unhappy, angry or calm, fearsome or righteous. It is the mana spirits that reside within every facet of our world’s existence that will judge what kind of a mana that an egg shall receive. From there, you can imagine that this mana would only further grow. For instance, a person of blue mana would be more sad, calm and unlikely to wish to hurt someone without just cause.” Upon speaking about the blue mana, the ember in front of Rylen shone just a little brighter.  
  
“A person of Red mana would be more angry, vengeful, likely to aggressive causes or responses. Those of an unending burning resolve to achieve whatever possible. Do you understand thus far, Rylen?” He nodded up and down, the concept was simple enough.  
  
“Can you…see what kind of mana I possess?”  
  
The colored embers in front of him all flashed brightly for a brief second.  
  
“I can, but understand that your earth does not exactly function in the same way that our world does. There are no spirits that grant various mana’s to your people upon birth, hence why you could not have casted magic upon your planet. But to come into my world, you would be judged immediately.”   
  
A circle begins to slowly form at Rylen’s feet as he can feel himself being analyzed. Spinning slowly at first, a barely bright white light enveloped him as it picked up speed, more and more circles elevating up and down his form as he is examined by what must have been those same mana spirits that she had been speaking to him about. “Are you able to…summon these spirits?” He asked her as the circles continued to scan up and down his form.  
  
“It is not that I summon them, only that they travel through me as a conduit of the world I come from.” ",1,1769798889.0,u_IHitBottles,0,1.0,False

Midnight chuckled and pat his head, ""My dear, never doubt a woman's ability to get what she wants.""

*Four hours earlier, in Nezu's office.*

Midnight ket out a satisfied groan as she dropped the ninety pind wheel of cheese on Nezu's desk, ""All yours if I can be Eri's care taker for the weekend.""

The small principal gave a quick thumbs up before pouncing on the wheel and biting his way to its core.

*Three hours later, in Aizawa’s office.*

Aizawa’s eyes widened as Midnight casually dropped a case full of Black Insomnia Coffee onto his desk. The woman smiled, ""The strongest coffee on the market, just for you, if I get to be Eri's caretaker for the weekend.""

The tired man looked from her to the box and back before clearing his throat, ""Either Midoriya or Mirio will be there to act as chaperones.""

Midnight grinned as he grabbed the case and stored it under his desk, ""Deal.""

Izuku nodded, ""That makes a disturbing amount of sense, but wasn't Present Mic supposed to watch her this weekend?""

I was working as a frontend dev in an e-commerce company. After COVID, things went downhill fast, shrinking budgets, temporary pay cuts, then layoffs.

At first I told myself I’d rest for a bit and then start applying. But honestly? I didn’t bounce back quickly. My sleep schedule was a mess, confidence was low, and the job market was already starting to feel colder than when I first graduated. So I didn’t rush into sending resumes.

To cover basic expenses, I tried to make some money from home. Nothing fancy. I reused what I already knew from work: product pages, funnels, pricing. I opened a small dropshipping store, picked a narrow niche, did some price research, used a tool like Genstore to get the site up quickly, ran ads, fulfilled orders, answered emails. The whole thing was very boring operations, but it worked. I wasn’t making crazy money, but enough to live.

What surprised me was how comfortable that became.

The side project slowly turned into my main routine. Wake up late, coffee, check ads, tweak listings, reply to customers. No meetings. No performance reviews. No commute. And because the store kept running, I kept postponing the idea of going back to a “real job.” Every time I thought about interviews, I told myself, “Maybe next month.”

Now I’m almost 30.

Lately something feels off. Working alone all the time, my world feels smaller. I don’t talk to many people during the day. No team, no shared stress, no dumb office jokes. I also feel like I’m slowly drifting away from the industry I used to be part of.

So I started applying again. Just a few resumes here and there, and the responses haven’t been great.

Some companies hint that I’m a bit senior for junior roles but not quite convincing for senior ones. Others focus hard on the gap, ask me “What have you been doing these three years?” Once I explain, the vibe sometimes changes. Not hostile, just hesitant.

And that’s where my anxiety kicks in.

Did I accidentally make myself unemployable by choosing the easy path for too long?

How do people usually explain a gap like this without sounding defensive or flaky?

Should I frame the last three years as entrepreneurship, freelance work, or something else entirely?

Or is going back to a traditional job after a long gap just much harder than I expected?

If you’ve been through a long gap, a late career reset, or hiring from the other side. I’d really love to hear how you handled it. I feel like I’m standing between two worlds and not fully belonging to either.",1,1769798741.0,careerguidance,3,1.0,False

1qre30d,https://i.redd.it/q0gs9w4u7jgg1.jpeg,"In 2018, during a 17-hour interrogation by the police, Thomas Perez Jr was psychologically tortured and coerced into falsely confessing the murder of his father, whom he had reported missing after failing to return home from a walk.","In 2018, Thomas Perez Jr. called the police in Fontana, California. His father, Thomas Sr., had gone out to get the mail with the family dog but hadn’t returned. Concerned, Perez Jr. called the police for help.
‎


‎Perez Sr., who was 71 at the time, took his dog, Margo, for a short walk to check the mailbox down the street. Just a few minutes later, Margo returned, but Perez Sr. was not with her.
‎


‎Perez Jr., who was living with his dad in Fontana, didn't initially think anything of it because they were friendly with all the neighbors. However, when Perez Sr. was still not home the following afternoon, Perez Jr. called police.
‎


‎“I just want to know that if there’s an elderly man walking in the neighborhood or sometimes he maybe got disoriented ... let me know, it may be my father. That’s it,” he said.
‎
‎
‎
‎
‎


‎Police arrived, searched the house with his permission, and claimed to find “visible bloodstains.” They also took photographs of the home and brought in a cadaver dog, who allegedly alerted them to the scent of possible human remains in a bedroom. Despite Perez Jr.’s cooperation, the officers found his demeanor “suspicious” and brought him to the station for questioning.
‎
‎


‎The interrogation began with hours of questioning while police obtained warrants to seize Perez Jr.’s electronic devices. After some time, they took him for a drive, claiming they were looking for his father. The ride was a pretense, just another way to continue questioning him. All it accomplished was a visible decline in Perez Jr.’s mental state.
‎


‎Detectives insisted Perez Jr. had killed his father but couldn’t remember doing it. They repeatedly asked him, “Where can you take us to show where Daddy is?
‎


‎They took a DNA swab from Perez Jr. and noted that although he was not under arrest, he was a primary suspect. They also brought him to a coffee shop, a donation box where they alleged his father's clothes had been taken and construction sites where he could've buried his father's body.
‎


‎""All they did was have me out in dirt fields today looking for bodies ... they got me all brainwashed,"" Perez Jr. later said.
‎


‎Back at the station, Perez Jr. asked for his medication and requested to be taken to a hospital. The officers refused, saying, “We’re not going to go to the hospital, because that’s not going to help you.” 
‎
‎


‎Perez Jr. asked to see his friend and business partner, Carl Peraza. The police allowed the visit but also tried to get Peraza to turn on his friend and get him to confess, Peraza testified in a 2023 deposition.
‎


‎""The officers indicated that what they needed me to do most was try to get an exact location of where Tom not only buried his father, but also to confess that he murdered his father,"" Peraza alleged.
‎
‎
‎
‎
‎


‎
‎They brought his dog into the room. The dog curled up at Perez Jr.’s feet. The detectives used this moment to say, “She (the dog)  knows because she was walking through all the blood.”
‎


‎Perez Jr. continued maintaining that he did not hurt his father, but he was stressed and sleep-deprived that he began ripping out his hair, pulling off his shirt and hysterically crying.
‎


‎""I no longer could see in color,"" he recalled to CNN in 2024. ""I was seeing everybody in black and white and then I felt physical pain, like an electric shock, and it went from head to toe.""He added, ""I was still hanging on, dealing with that loss until they told me they're going to kill my dog too.""
‎
‎


‎The detectives told Perez Jr. the dog would need to be euthanized because of the trauma of witnessing its owner’s murder.
‎


‎By this point, Perez Jr. was in clear mental distress—rocking, pulling his hair, crying, shaking, and pleading for help. When he fell to the floor and hugged his dog, the officers laughed and told him he was stressing the animal out.
‎


16 hours into the interrogation, the detectives told Perez Jr. they had found his father’s body in the morgue with stab wounds. It was a lie. But Perez Jr., mentally broken and physically exhausted, confessed.



‎The detectives then received a call from Perez Jr.’s sister: Thomas Sr. was alive and at LAX, about to board a flight to visit her.
‎
‎


‎
‎They brought Perez Sr. to the station, where they explained the case.
‎Perez Sr. claimed that he went to visit his brother and a friend and had forgotten his phone at home. Despite Perez Sr. being well and alive, he was still interrogated about his relationship with his son and whether his son was ever violent towards him.
‎


‎They didn’t rush back to tell Perez Jr. the good news. Instead, they let him sit alone in the interrogation room for another hour. During this time, Perez Jr., hopeless and defeated, untied his shoes and attempted to hang himself.
‎

‎The officers intervened—not to reassure him but to Mirandize him for the first time. They then sent him to a psychiatric hospital, leaving instructions that he was to have no contact with family members. On their way out, they dropped the dog at the pound as a stray.
‎
‎
‎


‎3 days later, a nurse at the psychiatric hospital broke the detectives’ order and told Perez Jr. that his father was alive. He was released shortly afterward and located his dog, only because it had been microchipped.
‎


‎""They left me in that mental anguish and to just suffer continually and then they put the block on the phone so that I can't receive the calls,"" Perez Jr. later told CNN. ""I suffered that way for three days"".
‎
‎



‎In May 2023, a federal judge ruled the interrogation tactics were unconstitutional, stating:
‎


‎“[Perez] was berated, worn down, and pressured into a false confession after 17 hours of questioning. [The officers] did this with full awareness of his compromised mental and physical state and need for his medications.”
‎


‎The city settled the case for $900,000 while denying any wrongdoing. The detectives involved were promoted.

A few very practical things usually come first, especially in winter:

* **Your weekday routine:** Most people find their schedule settles within **2–3 weeks**, once they understand commute times, parking, and traffic patterns around areas like Downtown, Midtown, or Overland Park.
* **Winter expectations:** January highs often sit in the **30s–40s°F**, which means icy mornings, slower drives, and planning errands earlier in the day. Roads around bridges and hills tend to need extra caution after snow.
* **Everyday anchors:** Newcomers usually lock in **2–3 regular spots** quickly. These could be a coffee shop like [Blip Coffee Roasters](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blip+Coffee+Roasters/@39.1078406,-94.6023638,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c0f055aa038127:0xb8efd04da8eeb729!8m2!3d39.1078365!4d-94.5997889!16s%2Fg%2F11b7227r40?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyOC4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D), a grocery store such as [Hy-Vee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hy-Vee+Grocery+Store/@39.245277,-94.6483095,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c05f4b3a8f2317:0x4a6d7a11fef83e62!8m2!3d39.2452729!4d-94.6457346!16s%2Fg%2F11_pt8_35?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyOC4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D) or [Trader Joe’s](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trader+Joe's/@38.9713443,-94.6090091,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x87c0e9288ffeb301:0x7edf0a3a3035aef5!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c0e92655ffad75:0xbe62dd8f75ce5056!8m2!3d38.9713402!4d-94.6064342!16s%2Fg%2F1yl46j7_g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyOC4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D), and one indoor place you return to weekly.
* **Indoor defaults:** Winter weekdays are often spent around warm, indoor spaces like the [Main Event Kansas City North](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Main+Event+Kansas+City+North/@39.2417979,-94.654988,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c05f45d76a571d:0xd7deac7bfcf2e45e!8m2!3d39.2417979!4d-94.654988!16s%2Fg%2F11c6f14qbq?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyOC4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D). You'll also have plenty of choices for local breweries in the Crossroads and West Waldo areas.
* **Where you actually spend time:** Even though KC is spread out, most people end up rotating between **1–2 main areas:** commonly Downtown/Crossroads, Midtown, or the [Country Club Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Country+Club+Plaza,+Kansas+City,+MO+64112,+USA/@39.040865,-94.5976004,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c0efb79076fb79:0x401c7f852667e6df!8m2!3d39.0413725!4d-94.5940452!16s%2Fg%2F11g1wp7_gk?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyOC4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D), rather than the entire metro.
* **What can wait:** Exploring every neighborhood, attending summer festivals, or planning weekend trips usually doesn’t matter until **spring**, once routines feel stable and daylight returns.

Depending on how it goes, I would be able to start doing this once a week at a few different locations throughout my city.

Here’s a bit more info- we are getting IKEA Tistorp base cabinets (first pic) with a warm/offwhite/creamy countertop and continuing onto the backsplash (second pic, inspo - we haven’t gotten countertop yet), and we are choosing between the flooring options in pic 3. Our top cabinets in the kitchen will either be matte white or painted in a creamy off white colour that we plan to paint the rest of the home in (think Swiss Coffee from Behr, something like that).

Most of our existing furniture is a blend of MCM and Scandi. We want to implement more MCM elements in our home, but we still love Scandi as well.

We wanted to get custom fronts for our IKEA cabinets but then IKEA told us we would lose our 25yr warranty, so we opted to stay with IKEA fronts.

Our condo is SW facing, gets quite a bit of natural light, but our kitchen specifically is a bit tucked away.

My friend Jennifer is turning 54 TODAY, January 30th, and she is spending it in a way that would break any human heart.
I have known Jennifer for 12 years. She is the woman who always showed up. She is the ""selfless"" one, the ""strong"" one, the one who never asked for a thing while giving everything away. But today, while she battles a brutal cancer diagnosis and the physical exhaustion of chemotherapy, she is discovering a terrifying truth: When you are the one who is always strong, people forget you can bleed.
The Heartbreaking Reality:
Jennifer is sitting home today with $0 to her name. Her immune system is failing, and she is terrified of getting sick because she can’t even afford a bottle of bleach to keep her home sterile.
Her children adore her—they are her entire world. Her son just started his first job 3 weeks ago and her daughter is a full time college student. Her father and brother have given every penny they had until they literally ran dry.
She has reached out for help on her own. She has cried out on social media. And the response? Absolute silence. Zero. Nobody even looked.
Imagine waking up on your 54th birthday, fighting for your life, and realizing that the world has just... moved on without you. Imagine the crushing loneliness of realizing you don't even have $5 for a clean shirt or a warm meal.
I am begging you—don’t let her be right. Don't let her believe she's alone.
I’m not asking for your rent money. I’m asking for the cost of a cup of coffee. If you read this and walk away, she stays in that silence. But if just 10 of us decide that a human life is worth $2 or $5, we can change her entire reality by tonight.
	•	• $2 buys a birthday card she’ll cry over.
	•	• $5 buys the disinfectant that keeps her safe from infection.
	•	• $10 buys a soft, new shirt that doesn't smell like a hospital.
Please. Do not let this mother, this friend, this fighter spend her birthday wondering if her life ever mattered.

1qrdqrf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrdqrf,My Slightly Ghetto Solution to Constant Headphone Swapping,"Like many of you, after some time in this hobby I’ve ended up with… a few headphones and earbuds of different kinds. I like to rotate between them depending on my mood, sometimes different IEM flavors, sometimes switching styles entirely, headphones or flatheads, which I also enjoy a lot.

What started to bother me, though, was the friction of changing setups. Constantly unplugging and replugging things was honestly more annoying than it should be.

So I picked up this small analog/passive switch box (which I mounted under my desk in a slightly ghetto way) that simply routes the audio to three outputs. Nothing fancy, just a clean mechanical switch. Now I can keep three flavors ready to go, IEM, flathead, and headphone, and switch instantly by flipping a switch.

My current chain is:

DAC → Switcher → Three different headphones.

This is how I have it set up right now. I usually rotate which flathead or IEM is plugged in, depending on what I feel like using. At the moment, though, I’m mostly using the Moondrop Old Fashioned, since they’re the newest addition 🙂

Also, hanging them under the desk keeps the desktop clean, while also protecting them from dust and accidental coffee spills, learned that one the hard way. Any clever setups or tricks I haven’t thought about? Always happy to steal good ideas 😄",19,1769797877.0,iems,8,0.91,False

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

\*\*About Me:\*\* Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

\*\*What I’m Like:\*\* Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

\*\*What I’m Looking For:\*\* I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

\*\*Dealbreakers:\*\* tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

For example -- I discovered that the owner of my favorite grocery store has contributed to multiple Trump PACs and GOP candidates. My money has been indirectly funding Trump's re-election!  So I won't be shopping there any more.  I then found another grocery store where they owner has contributed to progressive causes.  I will shop there instead. So I've started making a list of businesses where I want to spend my money and businesses that I will not use anymore. 

So if you can't protest today and you are looking for a way to make a difference, take an hour today and stage your own protest.  Make a list of where you shop and who you call for services. That could be grocery stores, laundromats, dry cleaners, restaurants, coffee shops, plumbers, HVAC companies, mechanics, furniture stores, car dealerships, mortgage companies, financial advisors, accountants, landscapers, car washes, etc.

Do an internet search of who owns the company (""who owns \[*company*\]?"" has worked well enough for me).

Once you have the owner's or owners' name(s), go to the FEC contributions search page. (https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/how-to-research-public-records/individual-contributions/)   Type in the owner's name in the box on the right.  The search is automatically limited to the current year, so you will need to delete those filters (you can just x them out at the top of the results).

If the name is a more common name, you can limit the search by state under ""More contribution details"" at the bottom of the sidebar.

Each state also has their own campaign contribution database, so be sure to search that as well.

You will see who you're funding, and you can decide if you want to continue to fund it.

That is one thing you do that will make a tangible difference.  It's all well and good to be opposed to what Trump and his enablers are doing, but if we are blindly funding it, are we really opposed to it?  Vote with your dollars.

# Quick snapshot

* **Category:** High‑stimulant pre‑workout
* **Servings:** 20
* **Serving size:** **1 scoop (22.1 g)**
* **Stimulant level:** **Very high** (400 mg caffeine + additional stimulants)
* **Flavors (varies by availability):** Pina Colada, Cherry Mango, Green Apple, Sour Blueberry, Tropical Mango

If you’re new to “hardcore” formulas or you’re stimulant‑sensitive, this is **not** a casual daily driver.



# Supplement Facts (per 1 scoop / 22.1 g)

* **L‑Citrulline — 10,000 mg**
* **L‑Tyrosine — 4,000 mg**
* **Beta‑Alanine — 3,200 mg**
* **Caffeine Anhydrous — 400 mg**
* **2‑Aminoisoheptane (DMHA) — 300 mg**

# What each ingredient is doing (plain-English)

# L‑Citrulline (10 g)

Commonly used to support **blood flow/pumps** by increasing nitric oxide availability (indirectly via arginine). **10 g is a large dose** relative to many mainstream pre‑workouts.

# L‑Tyrosine (4 g)

An amino acid involved in catecholamine production (dopamine/norepinephrine). Often included for **focus and “stress-resilience”** during hard training.

# Beta‑Alanine (3.2 g)

The classic **“tingles”** ingredient. It supports muscle carnosine over time (typically requires consistent intake), but acutely it’s mostly the noticeable paresthesia for many users.

# Caffeine Anhydrous (400 mg)

This is a **high** caffeine dose by itself. If you take a full scoop, treat it like your main caffeine source for the day.

# 2‑Aminoisoheptane (DMHA) (300 mg)

A strong stimulant often described as adding **drive/urgency** beyond caffeine. Effects and tolerance are highly individual.

# N‑Phenethyldimethylamine Citrate (300 mg)

A phenethylamine‑type stimulant used for **mood/drive** in some formulas. Human data is limited compared with staples like caffeine.

# Alpha Yohimbine / Rauwolscine (2 mg, 90%)

Potent stimulant/adrenergic ingredient that can feel “sharp” and can be **jittery** for some users (especially stacked with caffeine). This is one of the ingredients most likely to separate “advanced stim users” from everyone else.



# Who this is (and isn’t) for

**More likely to be a fit if you:**

* Have experience with higher‑stim pre‑workouts
* Want a **fully disclosed** label with aggressive stimulant support
* Train earlier in the day and can tolerate long-lasting stimulation

**Probably NOT a fit if you:**

* Are new to pre‑workouts, or you’re caffeine‑sensitive
* Train late afternoon/evening (sleep disruption risk is real)
* Have blood pressure/heart rhythm concerns, panic/anxiety issues, or you’re on stimulant/adrenergic meds (talk to a clinician first)
* Are **drug-tested** (see notes below)



# How to use it responsibly (harm-reduction > bravado)

* **Start with ½ scoop** for your first use.
* Take **20–30 minutes pre‑training**.
* **Do not exceed 1 scoop in 24 hours.**
* **Do not stack** with other stimulant products (fat burners, extra yohimbine/rauwolscine, high-caffeine energy drinks, etc.).
* Track your **total caffeine intake** for the day (coffee + energy drinks + pre-workout adds up fast).
* If you feel **chest tightness, dizziness, abnormal heartbeat, or severe anxiety**, stop use and seek medical advice.

Not medical advice — just common-sense guardrails for a heavy formula.



# Sport testing / compliance note (important)

If you compete in drug‑tested sport (or even if your job requires testing), be cautious. Some stimulants on labels can be treated as prohibited substances by anti‑doping programs, and supplement use is a common cause of adverse findings.

When in doubt: **avoid** high‑stim products and stick to third‑party tested options.



# Common “what will I feel?” expectations (very individual)

People typically report some mix of:

* Strong energy + alertness
* “Locked in” focus
* Elevated mood/drive
* Increased sweating / thermogenic feel
* Beta‑alanine tingles

Common downsides (especially at full scoop):

* Jitters, nausea, GI discomfort
* Elevated heart rate / feeling “wired”
* Anxiety/irritability
* Sleep disruption



# Community check-in (helpful comments format)

If you’ve used Maniaco, drop:

1. **Dose** (½ or 1 scoop)
2. **Timing** (minutes pre‑workout)
3. **Workout type** (lift/HIIT/etc.)
4. **Pros/cons** (focus, pumps, side effects)

That’s way more useful than “hits” / “doesn’t hit.”

Today he called, I said I'm tired. He asked when I'm ""cutting cake."" I said maybe tomorrow.

He then:

-Told me which cake to buy from which shop and which café to book (a lounge one I don't feel like going to)

-Called me rude for not organizing this already

-Said I'm cheap and that's why I haven't done it

I told him I was just planning simple cake and coffee at a quiet café. He insisted on his way.

I've told him I'm exhausted multiple times. He keeps pushing.

Now I'm dreading tomorrow before it's even happened. Just counting the hours until it's over.

Jesse was on Snap making his morning dAd fUeL🙄 coffee, getting ready for another full day of solo parenting while Farty finds reasons to hide from her children in closets (or in bathrooms). He was talking about Farty making her “poop juice” aka her morning coffee as she is seen awkwardly walking back and forth with a creepy look on her face in the background. 🤢 first of all TMI. Secondly, the fact that he continues to blast her on social media for farting and pooping is diabolical. Good thing the majority of her followers are bots. 😅

Also according to Jesse, “the hottest girls have tummy issues, we wouldn’t be married if you didn’t.” Farty is too dumb to catch on he just subtly admitted that he’s only with her because she’s “hot”(subjectively) and whatever perks being with a “hot” girl brings. They are both fools!!

Lastly, I wonder if they lowkey got married at a courthouse or something and that’s why Jesse is able to constantly leave and re-enter Canada, because I don’t see how else he could.

If you’re into good conversation, a few laughs, or even some lighthearted banter, send me a message. No pressure, just curious to see who’s out there and maybe make a new connection.
