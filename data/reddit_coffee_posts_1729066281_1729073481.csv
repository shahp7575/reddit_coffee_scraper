Hey, fellow coffee enthusiasts (or caffeine addicts‚Äîno judgment)! I‚Äôve recently realized that sitting in a coffee shop alone and pretending to enjoy the ‚Äúaroma notes of citrus and regret‚Äù is only fun for so long. So, I‚Äôm on the lookout for someone who‚Äôs down to grab a coffee and engage in deep philosophical discussions, like: why is the large cup called a ‚Äúgrande‚Äù? Or why does that one barista always look like they know something we don‚Äôt?

I‚Äôm all about cozy caf√© vibes, awkwardly spilling sugar packets, and trying to look cool while sipping on something with way too many syllables in its name. Bonus points if you can help me decide if this latte art is a swan, a leaf, or a Rorschach test for hipsters.

Let‚Äôs meet up, sip some bean juice, and mock the menu prices together. If you‚Äôre up for some good conversation over a cup of something unnecessarily complicated, send me a message. Just be warned: I‚Äôll probably order a brewed cup of coffee because to me it‚Äôs all about caffeine than coffee!",1,1729073073.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

","When I first noticed it in 2022 it came with intense stomach pain and apparently I had a lot of gas. An endoscopy showed I had gastritis. The medicine I got from the doctor helped me. It's called rebamipide. 

I didn't really have any other issues until a whole year later when I traveled and ate a bunch, got crazy stomach pain the first day. Took Gas X and it went away. 

Now this past week I've been feeling full? bloated? I think full would be the better word - I just woke up full and feeling achey in the tummy, without even having eaten anything. I got another endoscopy and I just have a ""slight"" case of gastritis I was told, which is weird cause it's lasted the longest it ever has. But no intense pain, so that's good I guess. 

I have tummy issues otherwise - maybe IBS? Coffee makes me go to the bathroom right away and spicy food annihilates me. Sometimes I'll have random diarrhea but nothing alarming. 

I'm not sure what foods to eat and not to eat. My doctor just said spicy food and foods that are ""stimulating"". 

I just need some pointers on how to take care of this - what foods do you guys usually avoid? 

I love avocado and chicken salad with oil and vinegar - should I not be having vinegar? Should I be cutting things out COMPLETELY? 

Also, have you all had similar symptoms to me like just feeling ""full"" for a week or something? I started taking medicine again yesterday and it still hasn't gone away so I'm a bit worried.

For 1:15 ratio, grind size of 45 clicks on 1zpresso Q, somehow managed to extract 280ml of coffee, may be it got a bit strong for my taste bud and I did mess up with timing,   the grind size got too coarse for this method I guess because the extraction was taking time.

It's bitter at first sip itself and then the orange/peach notes pops up, not too acidic at all, little bright and fruity, then I get subtle hints of black tea. Basically this was such a complex cup of coffee for me because all these while I had been using drip brew bags and I have seen a very huge distinction, you can say bitter/herb-like and then the sweetness which is low, more of bitter orange peels and peach, yes I did find the jaggery and henceforth the syrupy velvety texture in between, the jaggery was found from aroma and flavour notes.

But is it supposed to stink like tobacco? My whole mouth smells like tobacco, I'm going on drinking water, the usual smoke when inhaled and it feels dry(not my taste buds though), and I don't even smoke, but I never got this after-taste when I had it from drip brew bags, FP or even from Moka Pot.

But I'm truly happy because it was more of the bitter sweet iced tea without ice in it. The roast date was 24th August so almost 2 months later with my last cup of coffee brewed.",0,1729071558.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.5,False

I‚Äôve been having some trouble with my Saeco Gran Aroma SM6585/00 coffee machine. For a while now, I‚Äôve noticed a puddle of water under it.

To investigate further, I‚Äôve placed the machine on risers to observe the situation and pinpoint the source of the leak. Water is dripping from the front left part of the machine (see video). At first, there‚Äôs a light drip when starting the machine during the pre-wash, then it intensifies while brewing coffee, and there‚Äôs a very slight drip again during rinsing after shutting off.

There‚Äôs a small puddle behind and under the drip tray, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the source, as the machine has two holes underneath the tray that don‚Äôt seem to be leaking. The water appears to be coming from 1-2 holes on the left side, which aren‚Äôt connected to the interior (underneath the drip tray). The interior here is separated by the casing.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this problem? Is it something that can be fixed on my own (standard amateur skills)? I ordered the machine in April 2022, so it‚Äôs just out of warranty now. :(

","# The Breville BES920XL Dual Boiler that gives you commercial features and performance at home use price



Espresso perfection requires precision temperature and pressure control that is delivered consistently every time. And¬†[Breville Double Boiler](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/breville-bes920xl-dual-boiler-espresso-machine/) - BES920XL¬†Espresso Machine does exactly that by always making you the perfect coffee.



At the heart of this machine is its dual stainless steel boiler heating system. The espresso boiler, for the espresso shot, is PID temperature controlled, while a separate steam boiler offers instant and powerful steam on demand. So you can extract your shot at the right temperature, delivering optimal flavor, while simultaneously steaming your milk to cafe quality. What‚Äôs more, there is another element in the group head, ensuring the entire system maintains a consistent temperature.



The Dual Boiler also features an Over Pressure Valve (OPV) which limits the maximum pressure throughout the extraction, preventing bitter flavors in the shot. It also offers a true low pressure pre-infusion, which gradually increases the pressure to gently expand the grinds for an even extraction.



But there‚Äôs much more to this machine for the coffee geek. Brew temperature and pre-infusion pressure and duration are all programmable.





# Features | Breville Dual Boiler Espresso Machine BES920XL



The Breville BES920XL Dual Boiler offers commercial features and performance. You can expect to make Perfect Espresso consistently every time.

Dual stainless steel boilers and dual Italian pumps for simultaneous espresso extraction and steaming

* Over-Pressure Valve (OPV) limits extraction pressure; Flexible Shot Control

1g4v4ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1g4v4ow/two_weeks_in_the_good_and_the_bad/,Two weeks in: The good and the bad,"Doc prescribed me (25f) 20mg two weeks ago after I came very, very close to offing myself. Had a breakdown in front of my parents and I think I begged my dad to help me find something that could actually quell the anxiety and despair I've been feeling.

From the very next day I felt perkier. But I think this might have also been a placebo affect. I wake up with a panic attack, and only calm down a little while after taking my tablet. This used to happen before I started fluoxetine, btw. I was constantly in a state of on-verge-of-tears, straight up sobbing or just kind of vacant. 

For context, the industry I work in crumbled so I have to switch fields and I feel so far behind because I want to start earning proper money and I want to save and end up looking after my parents while also building up my own life. My depression (turns out it's been almost a decade since I've been going through it) was undiagnosed and it got worse over time, college was the lowest point in my life and I felt like it slipped even further just before I started fluoxetine. 

I felt exponentially better since I started my medication. I have gone on walks, I started water plants and keeping up with my chores, and I have been able to handle conversations and other people without breaking down. Everything was manageable (I want to say that fluoxetine numbs the sadness but I still have this recurrent voice in my head that rattles off everything that is going or can go wrong. I am not panicking anymore, but at the same time, I feel deeply uneasy) until yesterday where I had a phone call with a close relative who mentioned something innocuous that set me off.

I spent yesterday evening upset at my mother, and blamed her fear as a reason that's held me back throughout my life (while this is true in some sense, I still don't believe the fault lies with her. I should have stood up for myself, instead I let everyone dictate my life and ended up becoming quite the shut-in)

This led to an argument which left my mum in tears and it's only today that I feel any regret at all. Last night had me feeling just a bit vindicated, but I'm horrified right now. 

I don't know where I'm going with this exactly,  but fluoxetine helps in many ways, yes. It definitely gave me an energy boost. But it's also numbed my emotions and made me a bit more reactive but in very infrequent bouts as compared to my previous recurrent state of rage and despair.

I feel like I eat a bit less, I seem to not have much of an appetite, and I am a tea enthusiast,  but lately, the idea of caffeine doesn't sit well with me. I had a bit of coffee today and I feel weirdly keyed up. Even though I've never actually been affected by caffeine before.

Been sleeping a lot more (which is good for me because I was averaging three to four houses a day initially) but I do get up a but too late for my liking (I used to get up at 6:30am, but now it's at 8am, sometimes every 8:30 - 9:00 am.

Getting more things done, but I haven't been able to do my commissioned work (in my field, I still feel awfully disillusioned) but I'm hoping I can change that soon, so I shall at least have some side income.


Anyway. That's about it. I am glad I'm more productive and less upset, but I still feel like a vegetable.  It should take another four to six weeks to fully set in, however.",1,1729070104.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I have gotten my hands on a used Elektra Microcasa Semiautomatica. Quite the beautiful machine! To complement it I have bought a new Eureka Specialit√†.

I have tried six different types of coffee (100% arabica and different robusta blends). It doesn't matter how I dial the grinder or how much coffee I put into the basket, the end result is always tasteless and overwhelmingly bitter. Interestingly, with all beans I have tried (roasted between months and two weeks prior to grinding) the coffee tastes exactly the same. There is NO coffee aroma whatsoever, not in the smell nor in the taste.

Could the machine be in need of a deep clean?  
How would I proceed to said clean? I watched the YouTube videos of Stefano's Espresso Care, where he starts the disassemby by removing the central screw on the shower screen. I can't even get that screw to budge! I am quite mechanically inclined, but this seems to be beyond me.

I have been researching a lot but cant figure out any proper recipe to create filter coffee in bulk 

So i am ordering a traditional manual filter coffee machine - 5Ltr, one used by people in south. 

I figured out that 80:20 ratio is preferred, but what is a preferred brand of filter coffee powder that is used in Chennai (i am considering cothas to start with), but again i need suggestions. I will order in huge quantitites so if you know a good manufacturer please let me know.

Next what is the ratio of coffee powder: hot water that we pour in the filter.

I am very much an occasional casual player. I don't study, I don't practice. I play a 20-30 segment of Geo with my online students once or twice a week- 8 year old Chinese kids (who are getting very good at vibe guessing). In my own time, I just log in every now and then and play some duels. But I am a Geoguessr content fiend. I watch CG, Jake and Zigzag videos the minute they are dropped. I bow to the yaplord Debre and sip morning coffee to the RC's song of the day playlist. But I am a chronically 600-800 Gold player who plays duels like every 2nd week with dreams of one day vibe guessing my way to Master. Plonkit enjoyers will beat me 8 times out of 10.

  
But I've made a huge mistake. I made 2 guesses that I shouldn't have made. 

I made this post as a reference for my inevitable unban appeal. 

Jokes aside, maybe having read this and watched the replay, you'd say I'll be fine, standard Arg guess, lucky Portugal guess. But the zooming in the Arg round looks like a cheater, when I fat finger zoom in the wrong continent and then last second switch (something I see rainbolt doing all the time). And the Portugal round I pause camera for way too long at certain moments and some how get off the most insane guess of my life. Let me even confess that I had no idea that I was even in the right country for either guess (I didnt see the big Arg flag!).

Maybe this can be a post to bring attention to the Overwatch reporting. Someone might look guilty and be innocent. I saw a few videos of the report system and I dont think the pro players understand the difference between ""insufficient evidence"" and ""guilty"".

He gets to talk to adults all day,, drink his coffee hot, go to the bathroom when he wants and enjoy a commute in silence/listening to a podcast. What's not to enjoy?

When I went back to work after my first it was one of the most relaxing times I'd had in a year. Every person I know who has been the default/SAH parent for an extended period of time (like from more than a few hours to a week) says that work is a break, for all the reasons above and more.

He's never taken them both together on his own for more than 2 hours at a time.

He keeps saying he would be happy to, and I'm sure he would, but that's easy to say until you do it.

I know I need to say sorry because it really upset him. But I stand by what I said, it's what I think. He thinks the opposite, like I have this lovely life trundling to baby classes, walking in the sunshine and having coffee with friends.

1g4ulxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/RingConn/comments/1g4ulxh/ringconn_gen_2_compared_to_garmin_vivomove_style/,RingConn Gen 2 compared to Garmin Vivomove Style,"Hey everyone

Just wanted to share my experience with the RingConn Gen 2 after a few days of use, compared to my Garmin Vivomove Style watch (which I‚Äôve been using for about a year).

Similar Measurements

Most of the metrics are quite comparable. For example, yesterday‚Äôs step count was almost identical: RingConn: 6077 and Garmin: 5963. Heart rate readings are also quite close. Although they don‚Äôt match perfectly, I believe RingConn provides a good baseline for tracking trends and deviations, which is more important than 100% accuracy.

Sleep Tracking

The sleep tracking on the RingConn Gen 2 is much better. It accurately detected the two hours I was wide awake last night, which my Garmin missed for the first hour. Time in bed is also spot on.

Activity Tracking

However, the RingConn seems quick to categorize activities as ‚Äúmoderate.‚Äù It appears to rely more on heart rate than actual movement, so even having a cup of coffee or a stressful email triggers moderate activity. Consequently, RingConn registers double the amount of activity compared to my Garmin.

App Statistics

The RingConn app lacks some of the statistical I find useful in Garmin Connect, such as:

- Auto detection of activities like walking, running, and cycling, along with a timeline of activities during the day. I cycle to and from work.
- The number of stairs climbed daily.
- Estimated distance walked based on step count.
- Body battery measurement, indicating energy levels based on rest and activity throughout the day.
- Ability to overlay statistics such as heart rate data with other graphs like activity intensity or stress index.
- The option to add and track additional information like weight over time.

Conclusion

Overall, I appreciate the RingConn‚Äôs design and the improvement in sleep tracking, but it falls a little short in other areas compared to my Garmin watch. I am a little underwhelmed and not sure if RingConn can replace my Garmin Watch as I originally planned. 

I think RingConn will be good for people who are new to health tracking, but a little too basic for people already tracking with a watch or so.

1g4ugma,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1g4ugma/a_dream_that_my_dad_died_suddenly/,A dream that my dad died suddenly ,"Context: This dream was set in the present. My dad did a lot of things this year that I'm really proud of, he's working on himself, exercising and eating better. He's a much better and happier person. I don't live with him, so I text him every day, sometimes we speak on the phone and I visit for a whole weekend every 2-3 weeks. Our relationship really improved over the past year since we've started getting along more, and now I actually look forward to hanging out with him and seeing what he's up to. I do love him, but we're not a family that expresses their emotions a lot verbally. But I show him, I spend time with him, talk to him about his life, talk to him about my life, I cook for him, make him coffee, buy him sweets and things he likes. He's very appreciative of me and I'm very appreciative of him and our relationship evolved a lot over the past few years. I would say he's my best friend.

My dream starts when I find out that he died. He responded to my text last night and I somehow find out that he had a heart attack and died. And I'm devastated and don't really know what to do with myself. The dream goes around and around with me forgetting about the fact and then finding out again. I don't have a concept of time and I just feel bad and like I didn't do enough for him. 

All of a sudden my girlfriend and I are in his house (the house I grew up in) and everything smells like him and reminds me of him, but the house is empty, it's cold and it has no life in it. The house is big and has a lot of stuff in it so I keep thinking about a thought that I had a few months ago (I had it in reality and it was about all the stuff in the house that I'll have to sell/donate/throw it away when he dies. The thought wasn't malicious in any way, I don't want him to die, it was just a thought but I guess it stuck with me more than I knew). And in the dream I'm terrified because I feel guilty that the thought caused it, and that I somehow predicted the death with the thought.

I keep walking around the house, looking at things and I figure out that he finished a project (renovating his bedroom) that he has been doing for some time. I feel even worse because he finished it and didn't get to enjoy it for long. 

I see some things in the bedroom and figure out my sister and his husband have moved in - to my knowledge, it's been a few days since he died. I'm incredible angry about this because I feel like it's disrespectful to the man.

I go through our texts and I text him random things. I'm crying as I'm doing all of this. I'm venting to my girlfriend and just crying and days are just passing by. I feel incredibly sad and the dream seems to go on for a long while.

I finally wake up and remember that I woke up a few times but the dream just kept continuing when I'd go back to sleep. I feel devastated and I just checked and he texted me last night, so all is good, I hope. 

The dream was so realistic and sad and I had a feeling I cried in my sleep because my eyes were red and kinda swollen when I woke up.

On another note, lately I've been dreaming of packing a lot in different circumstances. I have two backpacks/suitcases/bags full of things and I'm just figuring out what should go in which one. There's no stress involved, I'm going slowly and figuring out as I go, it's actually fun for me. I read that it's about changes in life. If this could have something to do with this current dream, I'd love to hear it!

I've read a lot of things that this could mean but I have a feeling there are specific elements in my dream that I would be very grateful if someone interpreted. Thank you so much.",1,1729066994.0,DreamInterpretation,8,1.0,False
