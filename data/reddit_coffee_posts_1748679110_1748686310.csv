1kztn56,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kztn56,Pour over coffee water using Tesco Ashbeck and Lotus drops,"Hi all, trying to get great water for light roast pour over coffees using Tesco Ashbeck as the base and adding drops of Lotus Mg and Ca. What recipe would people suggest for 1L of ideal brewing water? 

If I add 2 drops of Mg and 2 drops of Ca is that good? 

My logic is

Calcium (Ca) mg/L:
   * From Ashbeck: 17.0 mg
   * From 2 drops Lotus Ca: 2 drops * 1.80 mg/drop = 3.6 mg
   * Total Ca: 17.0 + 3.6 = 20.6 mg/L
 * Magnesium (Mg) mg/L:
   * From Ashbeck: 5.0 mg
   * From 2 drops Lotus Mg: 2 drops * 1.09 mg/drop = 2.18 mg
   * Total Mg: 5.0 + 2.18 = 7.18 mg/L

So output would be 

* General Hardness (GH): ~81 ppm (as CaCO3) 
 * Alkalinity (KH): ~38 ppm (as CaCO3)
 * Sodium (Na): 10 ppm
 * Calcium (Ca): ~21 mg/L
 * Magnesium (Mg): ~7 mg/L
* TDS - 141


Thanks a lot!

I‚Äôve met some of my best mates on random nights out, male and female, also I‚Äôm not someone who sleeps around or looks for one night stands, I just enjoy the night and go home.

She‚Äôs been going through a tough time and I said rather than text why don‚Äôt we talk it out over a coffee, not thinking anything of it as I meet friends for coffee all the time.

Anyway, we meet up yesterday and she was really stressed and upset so I suggested going for a drive and chilling on a beach where we could talk without other people being able to overhear. So off we went and again we talked about serious stuff but also made each other laugh in equal measure. Still didn‚Äôt think anything of it, we‚Äôd both been quite clear that neither of us were looking for a relationship.

We were at the beach for a couple of hours and she said she was hungry, there was a really nice restaurant (not expensive, just a nice vibe) nearby, so I suggested going there and she agreed, saying she‚Äôd wanted to go there for ages but hadn‚Äôt got around to it. So off we went.

Come the end of the meal, I wanted to cheer her up a little and I knew she was struggling a little bit financially, so I paid, not really a big deal, I take my friends out and they reciprocate from time to time.

Now, obviously she‚Äôs been having a rough time of it, so I didn‚Äôt want to compound it by pushing her off and running away screaming. But now I‚Äôm trying to find a gentle way of reiterating that I‚Äôm not looking for anything right now.

I have a boomer business partner who's letting me do all the work. At the end of the day, it's a good thing, because if this guy took more initiative and tried to be more helpful, it'd end up in a catastrophe. Still, it'd be nice if I weren't the one exhausting all of of mental and physical energy 24 hours a day in regards to running this business. 

I had to go out of town for a bit, for work. When I get back to the office.. Little things are out of place, tons of missed calls on the phone, an overall display of ""No one straightened this place out for a week."" Oh, and there were a few gum wrappers thrown onto my desk. I called out the gum wrappers politely. He apologized , I moved on. Later in the day, I'm working away, and he's horsing around, he works of course but it's not with discipline, it's alway scatter brained and he always talks about his ""stress."" It's always about his stress and life sucks and Millennials are so irresponsible blah blah you get how boomers talk. It doesn't matter who else around is stressed.  He mentions wanting more work this week. He is pissed because we didn't receive phone calls Monday - Wednesday.. (I was still out of town then) He decides to go get coffee down the street. I take a minute, and check that phone. 5 missed calls Wednesday.. so he actively ignored the phone. He comes back and I told him he needs to call the numbers back if he's wanting to do more. Then I say that these little things aren't just for me to do and he needs to start raising his hand a little more for stuff like this. 

He gets quiet then exploded later about how I'm the one that's so irresponsible, there was dust on the tile around my desk.. very different from actively putting trash on top of a desk. He's ""Doing the best he can"" all the time. BS! I told him that's not true, he lets me do things a lot, and constantly is saying ""You do it"" in other words. Here's another thing too.. when he sees something maybe he's not ok with is he Mr Diplomatic and Intelligent? As if. Constant attitude and chip on his shoulder. 

This guy was gone because of surgery for over a year, what did he do? He came in and helped with the trash a few times. Never offered to maybe give the tax guy a check, never offered to order any supplies, when asked for help it was ""You do it"", answer an email, nothing. His surgery was debilitating, but not debilitating enough for him to have had it redone 2 times because he was doing things as normal, like moving furniture. 

I'm losing my focus while writing this, and home it's communicated well.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

## Key ‚Å¢Features Analysis

The lotus energy ‚Å¢drink ‚Å§boasts several key features that distinguish it from its competitors.

**Lotus Plant Adaptogens**

A defining ‚Å§characteristic‚Å§ of lotus‚Å£ energy drinks is their ‚Äçincorporation ‚Äåof adaptogens derived ‚Å¢from‚Äã the lotus flower and other botanical sources. ‚ÄãThese adaptogens are purported ‚Äåto help the ‚Å§body‚Å£ manage stress ‚Äåand ‚Äåmaintain homeostasis, possibly leading to a more balanced and sustained energy‚Äç lift. The exact blend and concentration of adaptogens may vary among different lotus energy drink flavors and product lines, but the presence of these ingredients is ‚Å£a‚Å¢ core element of the‚Å§ brand's‚Å§ identity.

**Natural Caffeine‚Äç Sources**

Unlike many energy‚Å£ drinks that rely on‚Å¢ synthetic caffeine, lotus energy drinks primarily derive their caffeine ‚Äãfrom ‚Äågreen coffee beans. This‚Å¢ natural caffeine source is often perceived as‚Äã providing a smoother ‚Äãand more gradual energy increase, ‚Äåreducing the likelihood of sudden spikes and subsequent crashes. The quantity of caffeine‚Äç per serving‚Äå typically falls within the‚Äã range ‚Äçof 80-180mg, making it comparable to a cup of coffee.**Reduced Sugar Content**

In ‚Å¢response to growing ‚Äåconsumer demand for‚Äã healthier ‚Å¢beverage options, lotus‚Äç energy drinks generally feature a lower sugar content than‚Å¢ many traditional energy ‚Äãdrinks.‚Å§ Many varieties are sweetened with natural alternatives‚Äå like stevia or erythritol,‚Äå further reducing the overall caloric load. This makes lotus‚Äå energy drinks a more appealing choice for individuals watching their sugar‚Äå intake ‚Å§or seeking a healthier energy‚Äã boost.

**Variety of Flavors**

Lotus energy drink distinguishes itself with a wide array of flavors. This‚Å£ goes beyond just the standard fruit flavors - their line includes fusion flavors like Blue‚Å§ Lotus, ‚ÄåPink Lotus, ‚Äåand even varieties like White Lotus. This allows consumers to find a flavor‚Å£ profile that suits ‚Å£their ‚Äãindividual preferences‚Äå and tastes, contributing ‚Å§to a more ‚Å£enjoyable and personalized consumption experience.‚Äç The‚Äå versatility of flavors ‚Å¢also encourages‚Å¢ experimentation and‚Äã the creation of custom drink combinations‚Å§ at cafes‚Å£ and beverage retailers.

**Enhanced Vitamin and Antioxidant Profile**

Many lotus energy ‚Å§drink‚Å£ formulations are fortified with vitamins and antioxidants, further enhancing their perceived health benefits. Common additions include B vitamins, which play a crucial role in energy metabolism, and antioxidants‚Äå like vitamin C, which help protect the body against free radical damage. These added ‚Å§nutrients can contribute to overall well-being and further differentiate lotus energy drinks‚Äã from their less health-conscious counterparts.

**Hydration ‚Å¢and Refreshment:** The formulation of lotus energy drink is designed to be refreshing and hydrating, making‚Äã it a more enjoyable beverage option than some of its more intensely‚Äã flavored and artificially sweetened competitors. ‚ÄçThe ‚Äãaddition of natural fruit extracts ‚Å§and lower ‚Å£sugar‚Å§ content contribute to a‚Äç lighter and less syrupy ‚Äåmouthfeel, promoting better hydration and‚Äã overall satisfaction. This benefits people working long hours outside or in environments that are dehydrating.

**Healthier Alternative:** With its focus on natural‚Å¢ ingredients, ‚Äåreduced sugar content, and added‚Äç vitamins and antioxidants, lotus energy drink positions itself‚Å§ as a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks.This can appeal to health-conscious‚Å£ consumers‚Å¢ who want an energy boost without compromising their dietary goals ‚Äçor overall well-being. This perception of a healthier choice‚Äå can contribute ‚Äçto greater consumer ‚Å£confidence and long-term product loyalty.

# CHAPTER 1: Nathen

You would think I‚Äôd have outgrown my habit of storming into places like I own them, but no, life has a funny way of making you revert to old habits. That‚Äôs exactly what I did as I slammed through the front door, rainwater dripping off my soaked clothes and leaving a trail of wet footprints behind me. The storm outside had been bad enough to make me contemplate curling up in a ditch rather than dealing with this, but somehow, I‚Äôd thought being inside would be better.¬†

I was wrong.¬†

The sight of him hit me like a slap to the face. There he was. The same smug, entitled jerk I thought I had left behind in high school, now lounging on my couch‚Äîno, scratch that, his couch. His stupidly long legs were stretched out, his feet propped up on the coffee table like he didn‚Äôt have a care in the world. And the audacity of it? He was sipping a steaming mug of something while I stood there looking like a drowned rat.¬†

‚ÄúSeriously?!‚Äù I snapped, throwing my drenched bag onto the floor. A satisfying splat echoed in the room. ‚ÄúYou were supposed to pick me up!‚Äù¬†

My voice bounced off the walls, but he didn‚Äôt even flinch. Instead, he calmly turned his head, the corners of his mouth twitching upward in a smirk that made my blood boil.¬†

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said, his tone so casual I wanted to throw something. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here.‚Äù¬†

I stared at him, mouth hanging open. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here?‚Äù I parroted, my voice climbing an octave. ‚ÄúI was standing in the rain for an hour, waiting for you! You said you would come get me!‚Äù¬†

He set his mug down with the kind of exaggerated slowness that only someone with a death wish would dare. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say when I would come get you,‚Äù he replied, stretching his arms behind his head like this was the most logical excuse in the world.¬†

If steam could physically pour out of someone‚Äôs ears, I would have looked like a malfunctioning cartoon character. My hands clenched into fists as I glared at him, my mind racing with every colorful insult I could throw his way. The nerve of him! But then again, why was I even surprised? He was the same guy who used to knock my books out of my hands in the hallway, the same guy who spread that rumor about me in sophomore year. And now he was here, in my house‚Äîokay, technically his dad‚Äôs house, which made it his house, but that wasn‚Äôt the point.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre unbelievable,‚Äù I muttered, shaking my head as I kicked off my soaked shoes, sending water droplets flying.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù he said, leaning forward to grab the remote.¬†

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù I hissed, still fuming.¬†

‚ÄúFor not leaving you out there all night,‚Äù he replied, flashing me a grin that made me want to launch the nearest decorative pillow at his head. ‚ÄúCould‚Äôve been worse, you know. Could‚Äôve locked the door.‚Äù¬†

I let out a disbelieving laugh, the kind that comes out when you‚Äôre so angry you can‚Äôt even find words. ‚ÄúWow. Thanks, Nathan. You‚Äôre a real hero,‚Äù I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.¬†

He chuckled, the sound low and infuriatingly relaxed. ‚ÄúGlad you noticed.‚Äù¬†

I wanted to scream but instead, I stalked past him, heading toward the stairs to my room. My clothes were clinging to me, and the cold was finally sinking into my bones, but I wasn‚Äôt about to let him see me shiver. Not after this.¬†

‚ÄúOh, and Mia?‚Äù he called after me, his voice taking on that irritatingly teasing tone he used to use when he was about to say something that would ruin my day.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I snapped, whirling around to glare at him.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a little something‚Äî‚Äù He pointed to his face, mimicking a smear across his cheek. ‚ÄúRight there.‚Äù¬†

I swiped at my face, mortified to find a streak of mascara running down my cheek. Of course, I looked like a raccoon. Of course, he noticed. And of course, he had to point it out.¬†

I didn‚Äôt dignify him with a response. Instead, I turned back around and marched up the stairs, my wet clothes making an embarrassing squelching sound with every step. Once I reached my room, I slammed the door shut behind me and leaned against it, closing my eyes and taking a deep breath.¬†

This was going to be a nightmare.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt even been here for up to a week, and he was already driving me insane. I had known moving in with my mom and her new husband would be an adjustment, but no one had warned me that adjustment would come with Nathan. Nathan, who apparently now had the title of ‚Äústepbrother.‚Äù Nathan, who clearly thought that title gave him free rein to make my life miserable all over again.¬†

I peeled off my wet clothes, tossing them into a heap on the floor before grabbing a towel and wrapping it around myself. As I stood there, shivering and trying to process the disaster that was my life, one thought kept running through my mind:¬†

How the hell was I supposed to survive living under the same roof as him?

# CHAPTER 2: Justice

The wet clothes clinging to me were the first thing that needed to go. I peeled off my drenched hoodie, grimacing as it stuck to my skin before landing on the floor with a splop. My shirt underneath didn‚Äôt fare much better‚Äîit was cold, clammy, and completely see-through.¬†¬†

My jeans were the worst. They clung to my legs like they had something to prove, making me twist and tug like a fish caught in a net. When I finally got them off, I kicked them toward the growing pile of wet clothes. My socks followed, soggy and gross, leaving me standing in nothing but my underwear. I shivered, rubbing my arms for warmth as I took a towel and made my way to the bathroom.¬†

The bathroom was tiny but cozy. It had one of those clawfoot tubs that looked charming but took forever to fill, a mirror that always fogged up no matter what, and a radiator that only worked when it felt like it. I reached out to twist the faucet, letting the water run until steam started to rise.¬†

I rummaged through the cabinet for my favorite lavender-scented bubble bath. The rain might‚Äôve turned me into a miserable puddle of frustration, but lavender always had a way of making things feel less awful. I poured a generous amount into the tub, watching as the water foamed and turned cloudy.¬†

Once the tub was full, I stepped in cautiously, the hot water stinging my frozen toes at first. But as I sank in deeper, the warmth wrapped around me like a hug I didn‚Äôt know I needed. I let out a long sigh, closing my eyes for a moment.¬†

The tension in my muscles began to melt away as I leaned back, letting my hair soak in the water. I ran my fingers through it, untangling the knots left behind by the rain. The smell of lavender filled the small space, calming me in a way nothing else had that day.¬†

As I scrubbed the day off my skin, my mind wandered back to him.¬†

Nathan.

He was now my stepbrother. Life had a cruel sense of humor.¬†

I tried to push the thoughts away, focusing instead on washing the grime from my arms, my legs, and everywhere else the rain had touched. I scrubbed until my skin felt raw but clean, like I was wiping the day off and starting over.¬†

After what felt like forever, I finally pulled the plug and watched the water swirl down the drain. I stepped out carefully, wrapping a fluffy towel around myself before grabbing another for my hair. My reflection in the mirror was fogged, but I could still make out the streaks of mascara smudged under my eyes. Lovely.¬†

Back in my room, I picked out a soft pair of sweats and an oversized T-shirt‚Äîcomfort over style was the motto of the night. I rubbed ointment into my arms and legs, the lavender scent still lingering in the air. It was part of my nightly ritual, one of the few things that made me feel like I had control over my life.¬†

Once I was dressed, I grabbed my books and notes from my bag. I had exam on psychology, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to bomb it. I set everything up on my desk, lighting a small scented candle for ambiance because, hey, if I was going to study, I might as well do it in style.¬†

I had barely gotten through the first section when the sound hit me like a slap to the face.¬†

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM.

I froze, pen in hand, as the walls vibrated with the thundering bass of music coming from downstairs. It was so loud I could feel it in my chest. I gritted my teeth, closing my book with a sharp snap.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me,‚Äù I muttered, pushing back my chair and stomping out of my room.¬†

I followed the noise down the hall, the volume increasing with every step. By the time I reached Nathan‚Äôs room, it was practically deafening. I didn‚Äôt bother knocking‚ÄîI threw the door open, my anger outweighing any sense of personal boundaries.¬†

Nathan was sprawled out on his bed, his phone in hand, completely unbothered by the noise that was shaking the entire house. He looked up when I walked in, raising an eyebrow like I was the one interrupting his night.¬†

‚ÄúSeriously?!‚Äù I shouted, motioning toward the Bluetooth speaker on his desk. ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he yelled back, clearly unable to hear me over the music.¬†

I stormed over to the speaker and slammed my hand down on the power button, plunging the room into blessed silence. ‚ÄúI said, what is wrong with you?‚Äù¬†

Nathan sat up, his lips quirking into that infuriating smirk of his. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMy problem?‚Äù I repeated, my voice dripping with disbelief. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to study, and you‚Äôre over here acting like you‚Äôre hosting a rave!‚Äù¬†

He leaned back, resting his hands behind his head. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt realize I needed your permission to listen to music in my house.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOur house,‚Äù I shot back, crossing my arms. ‚ÄúAnd maybe next time, you could turn it down to a level that doesn‚Äôt make the neighbors think there‚Äôs an earthquake.‚Äù¬†

He shrugged, clearly enjoying how much he was getting under my skin. ‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù¬†

I stared at him, waiting for an apology that I knew would never come. When it became clear he wasn‚Äôt going to say anything else, I turned on my heel and left, slamming the door behind me.¬†

Back in my room, I flopped onto my bed and let out a frustrated groan. Living with Nathan was going to be the death of me. I was already tired from the long day, and all I wanted was a little peace and quiet to focus on my upcoming exam.¬†

But, of course, Nathan wasn‚Äôt done being a pain.¬†

The music started again. No, blasted was the right word for it. It was louder this time, so loud I felt the vibrations rattling through the walls and straight into my skull.¬†

I groaned, squeezing my eyes shut. ‚ÄúUnbelievable,‚Äù I muttered to no one in particular. He was doing this on purpose‚Äîhe had to be. There was no other explanation for this level of obnoxiousness.¬†

For a split second, I considered going back to his room to yell at him again, but I knew how that would end. He would just smirk at me with that irritating, too-sure-of-himself look, throw some sarcastic comment my way, and turn the music up even louder out of spite.¬†

Nope. Not worth the energy.¬†

Instead, I grabbed my pillow and smashed it over my face, letting out a muffled scream. This was my life now. Living under the same roof as my high school bully turned stepbrother, enduring his constant torment, and trying to keep my sanity intact.¬†

But then, just as I was contemplating whether or not my pillow would make a good weapon, I heard it.¬†

Click.¬†

The sound of a door opening. Not just any door‚ÄîNathan‚Äôs father‚Äôs door.¬†

I froze, straining to listen as footsteps echoed down the hallway. My heart skipped a beat. This was it. Sweet, sweet justice was about to be served.¬†

Sure enough, the footsteps stopped outside Nathan‚Äôs room. There was a pause, followed by a sharp knock on his door.¬†

A few seconds later, the music stopped abruptly. The sudden silence was so jarring that it took me a moment to process it.¬†

I sat up, blinking in surprise. Did...did that actually work?¬†

A minute passed, then two. The music didn‚Äôt come back on. I couldn‚Äôt help the smirk that spread across my face. ‚ÄúFinally,‚Äù I whispered to myself, leaning back against my headboard.¬†

It didn‚Äôt matter what Nathan‚Äôs father had said to him‚ÄîI could imagine it was something gruff and to the point, the way he always spoke‚Äîbut the result was the same. Peace and quiet.¬†

I opened my textbook again, settling into a comfortable position. For the first time all evening, I felt like I could actually concentrate.¬†

# CHAPTER 3: Milk

The glow of morning light seeped through my curtains, prying my eyes open against my will. I groaned, burying my face deeper into the pillow, but there was no escaping it. Morning was here, and so was another day of dealing with‚Ä¶him.¬†

Dragging myself out of bed, I stretched until my joints popped, shaking off the last remnants of sleep. My to-do list was already running through my head: get ready, eat something, and survive the day. At least today, I had an exam I was kind of looking forward to‚Äîpsychology had always been my escape, a little pocket of sanity in the chaos of life.¬†

I grabbed my towel and toiletries, making my way to the bathroom. The tiles were cold under my feet, and the mirror was still slightly foggy.¬†

Turning on the shower, I let the water heat up while I brushed my teeth, the familiar minty flavor waking me up further. Once the steam started filling the bathroom, I stepped into the shower, letting the hot water cascade over me. It was bliss, washing away the grogginess and whatever tension I still carried from yesterday‚Äôs drama.¬†

I lathered up with my favorite citrus-scented body wash, the sharp, zesty smell waking me up even more. My hands worked through my hair, scrubbing out the tangles and feeling the suds slide down my skin. As the water rinsed away the soap, I tilted my head back and closed my eyes, savoring the warmth for just a few more moments.¬†

After drying off, I moisturized and grabbed my go-to outfit: a pair of dark-wash jeans and a soft, cream-colored sweater that hugged me just right. I added a simple pair of sneakers‚Äînothing fancy, just comfortable enough to get me through the day.¬†

Then, I reached for the necklace my best friend had given me for my birthday. It was a delicate silver chain with a tiny charm shaped like a star. ‚ÄúFor when you need a little light in the darkness,‚Äù she had said when she gave it to me. I smiled at the memory as I fastened it around my neck, the cool metal resting against my skin.¬†

Satisfied with my reflection, I grabbed my bag and headed downstairs, already planning out my breakfast. A bowl of cereal and some milk‚Äîquick, easy, and exactly what I needed to start the day.¬†

I froze as soon as I stepped into the kitchen, my eyes landing on him. He was leaning casually against the counter, the fridge door still open beside him. In his hand was the gallon of milk, tilted up as he took a long, deliberate swig straight from the bottle.¬†

I narrowed my eyes, my stomach sinking as I realized how little milk was left. Barely enough for a splash, and that was before he started chugging it.¬†

‚ÄúNathan,‚Äù I said slowly, trying to keep the irritation out of my voice. ‚ÄúAre you seriously drinking straight from the bottle?‚Äù¬†

He lowered the milk, licking a stray drop from his lips. ‚ÄúWhat? It‚Äôs just milk.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just milk. It‚Äôs breakfast.‚Äù I motioned toward the cereal box sitting on the counter. ‚ÄúMy breakfast, specifically.‚Äù¬†

He followed my gaze to the cereal, then back to the milk in his hand. A slow, infuriating smirk spread across his face. ‚ÄúOh, you wanted this?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äî‚Äù¬†

Before I could finish, he raised the bottle again, tipping it back and draining the last few drops. The sound of the empty bottle sucking in air was like nails on a chalkboard.¬†

I stared, dumbfounded, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and set the now-empty gallon on the counter. ‚ÄúGuess you‚Äôll have to find something else,‚Äù he said, his smirk widening as he walked past me, brushing my shoulder on his way out.¬†

I clenched my fists, my jaw tightening as I glared at his retreating back. ‚ÄúYou fucking asshole,‚Äù I muttered under my breath, seething as I slammed the fridge door shut.¬†

How can someone be so fucking shameless.

God, I hate him!

# CHAPTER 4: Fucking Childish

‚ÄúHow can he be so fucking childish?‚Äù I muttered, my voice dripping with frustration as I walked out of campus with my best friend, Tanny. The late afternoon sun warmed my face, but it did little to soothe the irritation bubbling in my chest.¬†

Tanny glanced at me sideways, her dark curls bouncing as she walked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about Nathan again, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWho else?‚Äù I threw my hands up in exasperation. ‚ÄúHe drank the last of the milk this morning‚Äîon purpose! And then had the audacity to smirk about it. Who does that?‚Äù¬†

Tanny snorted, the corner of her mouth twitching in amusement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre surprised. You‚Äôve been telling me for days that he‚Äôs basically a grown man with the emotional maturity of a toddler.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI guess some people never grow up.‚Äù I grinned, shaking my head. ‚ÄúBut seriously, what did I do to deserve him as a stepbrother? Karma‚Äôs gotta be real because I‚Äôm paying for something in this life.‚Äù¬†

Tanny let's out a soft laugh. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, nudging me with her elbow, ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs time you start thinking about an escape plan. How about getting a part-time job and saving up to move into your own place?‚Äù¬†

I sighed, tugging at the strap of my backpack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about it. Believe me, I‚Äôve thought about it a lot. But I‚Äôm just not ready for all the expenses and responsibilities of living alone right now. Not when I‚Äôm still in college.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair,‚Äù Tanny said, brushing a curl away from her face. ‚ÄúBut wouldn‚Äôt it be worth it? Just imagine‚Äîno Nathan, no milk drama, no loud music keeping you up at night.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTempting, but there‚Äôs no way I would be able to find a decent, affordable apartment this close to campus. Everything‚Äôs either overpriced or a total dump.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I get that. Rent around here is insane. And you would probably end up with some weirdo roommate who steals your food anyway.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù I said, heaving out a sigh. ‚ÄúAt least with Nathan, I know what kind of pain I‚Äôm dealing with. Moving out would just be trading one headache for another.‚Äù¬†

Tanny chuckled, linking her arm with mine as we strolled down the sidewalk. ‚ÄúAlright, fair point. For now, I guess you‚Äôre stuck with your man-child stepbrother. But if you ever change your mind, let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm great at apartment hunting. My cousin found this killer deal on a place last year, and I swear it was all thanks to me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou mean the place with the broken heating and the landlord who took six months to fix it?‚Äù I teased, raising an eyebrow.¬†

Tanny shrugged, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. ‚ÄúDetails, details. It had good lighting and free parking. Priorities, Mia.‚Äù¬†

I laughed despite myself, the tension easing from my shoulders as we turned the corner toward the little caf√© where we usually stopped after classes. The smell of fresh coffee and baked goods wafted through the air, and my stomach growled in response.¬†

‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù I asked, as we stepped inside and joined the line at the counter. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you want to move out if you could?‚Äù¬†

Tanny made a face, tucking her hands into the pockets of her jacket. ‚ÄúHonestly? Probably not. My parents drive me crazy sometimes, but at least they let me focus on school. Plus, free food is hard to beat.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù I admitted, glancing at the menu even though I already knew what I wanted. ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre both stuck for now.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBut stuck together,‚Äù Tanny said with a wink. ‚ÄúAnd that makes all the difference.‚Äù¬†

I smiled, feeling a little lighter as we placed our orders and found a table near the window. The sun was beginning to dip lower in the sky, casting a golden glow over the street outside. For the first time all day, I felt like I could breathe again.¬†

Tanny stirred her latte lazily, her hazel eyes flicking toward me as she leaned back in her chair. ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said casually, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the deal with your other stepbrothers? Still haven‚Äôt heard from them?‚Äù¬†

I shrugged, picking at the edge of my coffee cup. ‚ÄúNot much to hear, honestly. Most of them study out of state. You know, the whole ‚Äòpursue your dreams far away from the chaos‚Äô thing. They‚Äôre probably living it up while I‚Äôm stuck here dealing with Nathan‚Äôs bullshit.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLucky them,‚Äù Tanny said with a smirk, taking a sip of her drink. ‚ÄúBut wait‚Äîhow many stepbrothers do you have again? Isn‚Äôt it, like, three?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFour,‚Äù I corrected, rolling my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, I know‚Äîit‚Äôs ridiculous. A literal basketball team of brothers.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre not all like Nathan, right?‚Äù Tanny pressed, her curiosity clearly piqued.¬†

I hesitated, tapping my fingers against the table. ‚ÄúNo, not really. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶different. Most of them are actually decent. They‚Äôre just not around much. College, internships, jobs‚Äîthey‚Äôve all got their own stuff going on. They‚Äôll probably swing by after their semester ends, though. Family gatherings and all that fun stuff.‚Äù¬†

Tanny raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúFun? Is that what we‚Äôre calling it now?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOkay, fine,‚Äù I admitted, slumping back in my chair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more like forced bonding time with people I barely know anymore. The last time we were all in the same room, I think I was still wearing braces. I never knew there would be a moment where I would be calling them my stepbrothers.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo... what‚Äôs the dynamic like? Are they cool?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶mixed,‚Äù I said, choosing my words carefully. ‚ÄúIts been a while but some of them were cool. Like Adrian‚Äîhe‚Äôs the oldest, and he‚Äôs always been the responsible one. You know, the type who actually acts like an adult.‚Äù¬†

Tanny nodded. ‚ÄúAnd the others?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs Noah,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a little more laid-back. Kind of the ‚Äòchill, let‚Äôs just go with the flow‚Äô guy. Then there‚Äôs Jordan, who‚Äôs basically a walking, talking ball of energy. He‚Äôs more like Nathan. Likes to push buttons for fun, but at least he‚Äôs less petty about it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLess petty than Nathan? That‚Äôs not saying much,‚Äù Tanny joked, making me laugh.¬†

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù I said, shaking my head. ‚ÄúAnyway, they‚Äôll all be here eventually. Until then, it‚Äôs just me and Nathan holding down the fort. And by ‚Äòholding down the fort,‚Äô I mean he‚Äôs doing everything in his power to drive me insane.‚Äù¬†",1,1748684761.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I've mostly followed the Dortania guide to the letter (I think) to create the EFI but while I can get the USB installer to boot and install the macOS installer on the new SSD, it crashes instantly when rebooting to the macOS installer. Worth nothing that I can boot back into Big Sur with my new EFI just fine.

I've got a lot of things to double-check and I've only glanced at the logs so far, so I'm not so much looking for help on fixing this (yet) but rather need a sanity check on CPU/GPU spoofing, since it doesn't seem so well documented in the guides, (unless I missed something) : spoofing the CPU and iGPU.

 I'm using iMac19,1 smbios. Three things I'd like to know:

\- I'm using the dGPU for output, should I use the headless coffee-lake id for the iGPU or should I rather stick to headless kaby-lake id? I've tried both, didn't solve the main issue but both booted successfully to Big Sur...

\- Any other smbios worth trying out? I've seen MacPro7,1 getting thrown around a lot but the CPU seems very different...

\- I've followed the KabyLake guide to create my config.plist, except obviously for the smbios section, but should I rather be using the Coffeelake guide as baseline?

**Config is i7-i7700 cpu, hd630 igpu, rx480 dgpu, z270 motherboard (ASUS TUF).**

1kzta0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsideIndianMarriage/comments/1kzta0q/navigating_love_marriage/,Navigating Love Marriage,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) have been dating for almost 4 years. A year ago, I had to push him to talk to his parents about marriage. There was a lot of back and forth due to horoscope issues and cultural differences from both sides. His mom was particularly concerned that my kundli showed anger issues. They eventually decided to meet my parents after almost 7-8 months of discussions. They had the condition that I had to spend time with them before they met my parents. The first day went fine, but the next day over lunch, they started questioning me in a rather interrogative way: Will you be able to manage the household with so much cultural differences, Will you be willing to move everywhere where he goes, will you be willing to settle in their city etc to some of which I replied negatively"" The whole ordeal felt very odd and even rude at times. In between this questioning when I was looking at my boyfriend for assurance, his dad asked him to go get coffee as if to make sure I am isolated. I was shocked, and my mood naturally changed and I even sort of complained to my boyfriend a few times for the rest of the day. His parents were keeping a close eye on me the whole time. He mostly stayed silent and later justified it as normal parental caution, adding that his parents noticed my ‚Äúanger issues‚Äù because my behaviour shifted. The next day when they met my parents, his parents behaved in a superior, condescending manner throughout. There were language barriers and I had to manage most of the conversation by translating and speaking on my parents' behalf. His mom asked if I will be ready to do Puja according to their traditions to which I replied as politely as possible that it will be overwhelming to me as I am not used to such practices at my home. To which his mom replied that I was disrespecting elders by saying no. His parents didn't let my bf speak much and neither did he try to speak up the whole time. The situation became tense and humiliating, forcing my family to end the meeting

Despite this, I and my boyfriend reconciled after few weeks mainly due to my efforts after a lot of arguments. When I questioned him about his behaviour that day, he said he couldn't do anything as he felt unsure of marriage and only proceeded due to my pressure. We dated again for another 3-4 months and this time he said he felt ready to talk to his parents again. He tried to talk to them stating that he was sure about me. They had too many concerns this time. They felt like I am not very family oriented, they wanted someone who would cook and take care of the household responsibility so that my bf could focus on earning. They felt I would be indifferent to them as well as I am not very social and that I won't talk to his mom as I didn't like her.

I have always wanted to take these decisions amicably by splitting the responsibility more or less equally as even I wanted a career and didn't want to involve his parents. They were telling him that she should be willing to do all this for you if she really loved you. And my bf also seemed to slide with them regarding wanting traditional roles in marriage as he was earning much higher than me and comparatively more driven and career oriented. But he was willing to compromise this after a lot of discussions. Even then he seems to backpedal on this after every discussion with his parents.

As they were very against going ahead with this marriage, he said I will have to try and fix the relationship with his mom also. But I felt it was too much to ask from me as I had been humiliated enough by them and didn't want to interact with them again. When I gave him an ultimatum, he firmly said he can't go forward without his parents approval and said that we both have different ideas about marriage.

What hurts is how easily he seems to give up, especially when he seemed great and understood wanting equality when everything was going smooth. I am also confused if I‚Äôm wrong for wanting distance from his parents. How is he behaving so indifferent as soon as his parents starts talking to him? At the same time, even if I try my best now, won't this behaviour from their side make my life harder in the future.",2,1748684727.0,InsideIndianMarriage,3,1.0,False

Am i the problem?,"I‚Äôm 18M and I‚Äôve been dealing with some stuff for a long time now, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just laziness, burnout, depression, ADHD, or something else. I am starting to think the problem is me being lazy.

I‚Äôve stopped feeling guilt about things I used to care about ‚Äî university, gym, responsibilities, etc. I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything productive anymore. Most days I just want to lie in bed, game for hours, or maybe go out with friends , but then go right back to my screen or bed.

When I try to study, I either can‚Äôt start or can‚Äôt focus. I end up reading the same thing over and over and absorbing nothing. Even if I manage to force myself to sit down i always try to find anything else to do. I forget small details, like what someone just said or where I put my keys or phone. Exams are getting close, but I haven‚Äôt opened a book. Deep down I believe I will be ready when the time comes ‚Äî even though it‚Äôs happened before in the first university semester and I failed 3 subjects. (Computer Engineering if anyone cares)

I also get really sleepy whenever I try to study, even after coffee. And when I talk to people, it sometimes feels like I‚Äôm not even there or not in my brain.  talking nonsense mid-conversation.

I also tend to chase cheap dopamine activities, i even started smoking here and there and that is something i never thought i will ever do in my life, i am also addicted to something else i would not like to mention but you can pretty easily guess.

Are these symptoms linked to ADHD? Depression? Something else? Or is this just a phase that will pass? I genuinely don‚Äôt know if this is a real problem or if I‚Äôm just imagining it.

Would love to hear if anyone else has experienced something like this.

The room was cold. Not from the air conditioning, but from the hot tension seeping from every corner of this room and the gaze of the person sitting in front of me.

I sat uncomfortably on a metal chair, my body was stiff and my fingers fiddled with the hem of my blouse, the one Damon had bought for me on my last birthday. I tried to force myself to stay composed but my heart was beating wildly in my chest like any seconds from now it could leap out, but I kept my chin up. I had to be strong‚Äîfor him.

Across from me, Vivienne Sterling sat with the same effortless poise I had always admired and feared. Her red lips curved into something that looked like sympathy, but I knew better. She wasn‚Äôt a woman who dealt in kindness. She dealt in power. And right now, she was holding mine in the palm of her hand.

‚ÄúElara,‚Äù she said, her voice smooth, practiced. ‚ÄúYou and I both know how this ends if we don‚Äôt act quickly.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. ‚ÄúDamon didn‚Äôt do this.‚Äù I said feeling the nausea that had been with me for weeks now roll around my tummy. But I did my best to remain calm.

Vivienne let out a small sigh as if she was dealing with a naive child. ‚ÄúOf course not. But the evidence says otherwise. And if this goes to trial, the prosecutors will tear him apart. The board will remove him as CEO. The media will drag the Sterling name from here to Japan through the mud. Everything he‚Äôs built, everything you have worked for will be gone.‚Äù

I clenched my fists beneath the table. This was a nightmare. A cruel, twisted nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake up from.

The charges against Damon were serious‚Äîcorporate espionage, embezzlement, fraud. I had seen the reports, the falsified bank statements linking him to stolen company funds. But it wasn't true. It had to be wrong. Damon wasn't perfect ‚Äì God knew we'd had our fights ‚Äì but he wasn't a thief. Someone was framing him, trying to destroy him. And now, his mother was here, the great Vivienne Sterling, asking me to be the solution.

She slid a document across the table, a sleek black pen resting on top.

‚ÄúIf you confess, the trial will never happen,‚Äù Vivienne continued, her voice patient, as if she were explaining a business deal rather than asking me to ruin my life. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll serve a short sentence. We‚Äôll make sure of it. And when you‚Äôre released, Damon will be waiting. We‚Äôll protect you. You‚Äôll have everything back.‚Äù

I barely heard her. My eyes were locked on the paper in front of me, the words blurring together.

Confession of Guilt.

A single signature, and I would become the villain. The one who stole millions from Sterling Enterprises. The trusted employee who siphoned money from the company that feeds her. The one who betrayed the man she loved.

‚ÄúElara.‚Äù Vivienne‚Äôs voice softened, almost gentle. ‚ÄúDamon needs you.‚Äù

And that was all it took. That statement was the key to unlock everything. Because Vivienne and I both know that I would do anything for him. Anything to protect the man who had shown me what love could be, who had believed in me when I was nothing but a junior accountant with big dreams and a secondhand suit.

I reached for the pen, my fingers trembling as I pressed it to the paper. With a deep breath, I signed my name.

The moment the ink dried, the door swung open.

Two uniformed officers strode in, their faces devoid of emotion. One of them pulled me to my feet, his grip firm but not rough.

‚ÄúElara Quinn, you are under arrest for corporate espionage and embezzlement.‚Äù

My breath hitched. Even though I had agreed to this, hearing those words made it real.

I turned to Vivienne, looking for any sign that this nightmare is going to have a happy ending, but she was up on he r feet , smoothing the invisible wrinkles from her tailored silk blouse.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of everything,‚Äù she said, her expression unreadable. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight it.‚Äù

I nodded, even as cold steel cuffs wrapped around my wrists.

It was fine. It would be fine. I told myself.

This was the price of love. This was what it meant to protect someone more than yourself.

The officers led me out of the interrogation room, my heart trying to match pace with my quickening steps. The hallway seemed endless, lined with reporters who erupted into chaos at my appearance. Questions flew like arrows, camera flashes exploded like lightning in a summer storm. But none of it mattered.

Because at the end of the corridor, standing like a statue, was Damon.

His emerald eyes, the ones I'd woken up to countless mornings, locked onto mine. But there was no relief in them. No gratitude. No trace of the love we'd shared just yesterday.

Only cold, seething rage that turned my blood to ice.

My pulse stuttered. ‚ÄúDamon‚Äî‚Äù his name escaped my lips like a whispered prayer.

He didn‚Äôt say anything.

Didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt fight for me.

He just turned his back and walked away as if I had meant nothing. As if I hadn‚Äôt just given up my life for him..

The world tilted. My legs nearly buckled, but the officers kept me upright.

No. No, no, no. I screamed in my head. This wasn‚Äôt how it was supposed to go.

He was supposed to understand. He was supposed to know I had done this for him.

But he believed I was guilty.

He believed I had betrayed him.

The police pushed me into the back of their truck, the first sob ripped from my throat the moment the door slammed shut at my face. My bison was blurred by tears as I couldn‚Äôt hold it in any longer.

Then all of a sudden, nausea hit.

A violent wave rolled through me, my stomach twisting painfully. I barely had time to turn before I threw up, my entire body shaking.

The officer in the front seat swore, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúYou okay back there?‚Äù

I wiped my mouth, a taste of bike bitter on my tongue as my hands were still trembling.

The nausea that had been a constant thing in my life for the past weeks. The morning sickness that I‚Äôve been ignoring. Even the dizziness and the deep-bone exhaustion.

Realization slammed into me like a towing truck.

I wasn‚Äôt sick.

I was pregnant.

And I was going to prison. Fuck!

# CHAPTER 2: PRISON OF BETRAYAL

Elara's POV:

I stopped counting the days when I hit ninety-eight.

Time doesn't move right in prison. It stretches like taffy, pulls you under like quicksand, warps your mind until you can't remember what freedom felt like. The days blur together in an endless loop of metal doors clanging, guards barking orders, and the constant, suffocating weight of knowing you're trapped.

The prison walls held more than just concrete and steel ‚Äì they held broken dreams and bitter truths. I used to be somebody. Elara Quinn, rising star at Sterling Enterprises. The woman who'd captured Damon Sterling's heart. Now? Just another number in an orange jumpsuit, trying to survive each hour without breaking.

At first, I clung to the Sterlings' promise like a lifeline. They'd get me out. They had to. This was all part of some elaborate plan, some necessary evil to protect the company. To protect Damon.

But months crawled by, and no one came.

Now I wasn't just prisoner 247891. I was the pregnant one.

And in here, that made me prey.

The cafeteria reeked of industrial cleaner and desperation. I balanced my tray carefully, keeping my movements measured despite the extra weight I carried. Seven months of growing life inside me had changed my center of gravity, made me vulnerable in ways I couldn't afford to be.

""Getting pretty round there, Princess.""

My fingers tightened on the metal tray, knuckles going white.

Monica Ruiz. Former gang leader, current prison queen. A woman who'd learned early that violence was power, and never forgot the lesson.

""Just leave her be,"" someone muttered from the crowd, already bored with today's entertainment.

Monica's lips curved into a predator's smile. ""I'm only looking out for her. Prison's no place for a baby."" She leaned forward, voice dripping false concern. ""Maybe you should take care of that little... problem before it gets worse.""

Rage burned in my throat like bile. Three months ago, I would have fought back. Would have shown her exactly why I'd climbed to the top of the corporate ladder before thirty.

But I had something else to protect now.

I turned away, dignity the only shield I had left.

The tray hit the floor before I took two steps.

Cold slop splattered across my jumpsuit, chunks of whatever-it-was sliding down my belly.

Laughter exploded around me like shrapnel.

I caught my breath, hands fisting at my sides. My baby kicked, strong and angry, like they knew. Like they were ready to fight too.

Don't react. Don't give them what they want.

Monica's grin widened. ""Whoops. Guess the floor's slippery.""

I wiped mashed potatoes from my face, met her eyes, and said nothing.

Because pride wasn't worth dying for.

But my baby was worth living for.

The guards called me to visitation that afternoon, their voices bored and cruel as always.

Hope fluttered in my chest like a trapped bird. Had Damon finally realized? Had someone told him‚Äî

The hope died when I saw who waited behind the scratched plexiglass.

Leo Carter sat ramrod straight in his off-the-rack suit, all sharp edges and careful calculation. I remembered him from Sterling Enterprises ‚Äì the intern who watched everything, who learned faster than anyone gave him credit for.

""Why are you here?"" The words scraped my throat raw.

Leo studied me with eyes too old for his face. ""I know what really happened.""

A laugh clawed its way out of me, bitter as prison coffee. ""Do you? Everyone seems to know what happened except me.""

""I know you didn't do it.""

Four words. Just four words, but they hit harder than any prison yard beating.

Leo leaned forward, voice dropping low. ""The numbers never added up, Elara. The security breaches, the timing ‚Äì none of it makes sense. Not with someone like you running things."" His jaw clenched. ""You were set up. And I think I know why.""

My hands shook under the table.

""I can help,"" he pressed on. ""I have resources, connections. If we work together‚Äî""

""Stop.""

He frowned. ""What?""

I forced steel into my spine, into my voice. ""I don't need your pity, Leo. Or your help.""

""This isn't pity, it's‚Äî""

""I signed a confession,"" I cut him off. ""End of story.""

The silence stretched between us like razor wire.

Finally, Leo nodded, but his eyes said he wasn't done. ""If you change your mind..."" He slid a business card across the table. ""Call me. Day or night.""

I left it there.

Some hope is more dangerous than despair.

That night, they called me to the phones.

A privilege that had to be bought. Which meant only one person could have arranged it.

Vivienne Sterling.

The receiver weighed a thousand pounds as I lifted it. ""Hello?""

""Elara."" Her voice was silk over steel, unchanged by the months since she'd orchestrated my downfall. ""I have news you should hear from me.""

My stomach twisted. ""What news?""

A pause, perfectly calculated for maximum impact.

""Damon is getting married.""

The world stopped spinning.

""What?"" The word came out strangled.

""To Sienna Calloway,"" she continued, each word another nail in my coffin. ""The wedding is next month. He's moving forward with his life, dear. You should do the same.""

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think.

""He wants nothing to do with you or... that mistake you're carrying.""

My hand curved around my belly, protecting my child from her poison.

She kept talking, words designed to cut, to wound, to destroy.

But all I could hear was the sound of my last hope dying.

Damon hadn't been waiting.

Hadn't been searching for the truth.

Hadn't been fighting for me.

He'd replaced me.

The phone slipped from numb fingers.

Back in my cell, reality crashed over me in waves.

I sat on the thin mattress, staring at concrete walls that had seen thousands of broken dreams before mine.

And something inside me changed. If I ever get out of here, I wouldn‚Äôt beg for explanations, instead, I‚Äôll burn the Sterling Empire to the ground.

The pain started two weeks later.

Sharp and twisting, like knives in my gut. I doubled over on my cot, panic rising hot and fast. Not yet. Not here. Not like this.

""Help,"" I called, but the word was lost in the endless noise of the cell block.

Time twisted, stretched, compressed.

By the time they dragged me to the infirmary, black spots danced at the edges of my vision.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry wasps. Voices floated around me, distant and meaningless.

Then the pain doubled, tripled, became my whole world.

I screamed.

And as consciousness slipped away, I had one last thought‚Äî

Please let my baby live.

# CHAPTER 3: RISING FROM THE ASHES

Elara's POV

The sun was too bright.

After a year in fluorescent hell, natural light felt like needles against my skin as I stepped through the prison gates. My body was a stranger to me now ‚Äì too thin, bones pressing against flesh that hung loose on my frame. The clothes they'd given me might as well have been sacks.

One year.

Three hundred and sixty-five days of grime that no shower could wash away. Of hunger that gnawed deeper than my stomach. Of threats whispered in dark corners by women who'd lost more than their freedom. One year of watching my daughter grow through steel bars until some faceless committee decided I'd paid enough for a crime I never committed.

Livia stirred against my chest, her tiny fingers clutching my shirt like she understood everything was about to change. Again. She was my anchor, my reason to keep breathing when that cell threatened to suffocate me.

The bag over my shoulder might as well have been empty. A few papers, baby clothes, and memories I couldn't seem to let go of. I took a step forward, then another, each one harder than the last.

No money. No home. No family.

Some twisted joke this freedom was ‚Äì trading one prison for another.

I walked until my feet screamed.

The city lived on without me, like I'd never existed at all. Same streets, same crowds rushing past with their perfect lives intact. But I wasn't one of them anymore. Prison strips away more than time ‚Äì it takes the illusion that you ever belonged.

Glass towers stretched toward the sky, mocking me with memories. Through windows, I caught glimpses of my old life ‚Äì designer heels clicking on marble floors, security badges swinging from expensive blazers, everything I used to be.

My legs shook with each step. The last meal ‚Äì if you could call it that ‚Äì had been yesterday's prison leftovers. Pride kept me moving, but pride doesn't feed a baby.

Livia whimpered, the sound cutting straight to my soul.

""I know, baby,"" I whispered, pressing my lips to her forehead, still soft and perfect despite everything. ""I know.""

I tried to keep going, but the world started to spin.

Too many hours without food. Too many sleepless nights.

My knee buckled.

The ground rushed up to meet me.

Livia's cry pierced the air as I twisted, making sure she landed on top of me.

Then darkness swallowed everything.

I woke to something I'd forgotten existed ‚Äì comfort. Real comfort, not just the absence of pain.

My eyes snapped open, heart racing.

Soft lamplight painted unfamiliar walls in amber. Clean sheets smelled of lavender, not industrial bleach. For a moment, I thought I was dreaming.

Livia.

Panic shot through me until I saw her ‚Äì safe, sleeping, wrapped in a blanket that probably cost more than everything I owned.

The door opened with a gentle creak.

Every muscle in my body tensed, ready to fight.

But it was Leo Carter standing there, hands casual in his pockets, watching me with eyes that saw too much.

""Good. You're awake.""

My voice came out rough. ""Where am I?""

""My place,"" he said, like it was the most natural thing in the world. ""You passed out on Fifth Avenue. Lucky I happened to be there.""

I stared, trying to make sense of him. This was the same Leo who'd always been too smart for his own good, but something had changed. The restless energy had settled into quiet confidence. Power worn like a second skin.

""Why?"" The question scratched my throat.

His mouth quirked up. ""Because asking if you needed help would've been a waste of breath.""

I looked away from his knowing gaze. ""I don't need‚Äî""

""Bullshit.""

The word hit like a slap.

Leo's sigh filled the room as he stepped closer. ""Tell me you have somewhere else to go.""

My jaw clenched so tight it hurt.

The silence stretched between us, heavy with truth.

He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture so familiar it ached. ""I'm not looking for anything in return. No conditions. No debt. Just... stay. Get your feet under you.""

Something cracked in my chest.

Trust was a luxury I couldn't afford. The last time I'd given it away, it had cost me everything.

But Livia made a soft sound in her sleep, fingers curling into her blanket like she was holding onto a dream.

And God, I was tired. So tired of carrying the weight alone.

So I whispered the word that would change everything: ""Okay.""

I didn't waste a single day.

Leo offered shelter, not charity, and that's exactly what I needed.

I worked like I was running out of time. Maybe I was. Every moment not spent with Livia was invested in rebuilding myself from scratch.

Night after night, I absorbed everything I could about the new business landscape. Market trends, emerging tech, startup strategies ‚Äì the world hadn't stopped evolving while I was gone.

During the day, I took whatever work I could find. Freelance consulting for small businesses. Writing code until my vision blurred. Building a reputation one project at a time.

I lived for my daughter, but I worked for the day I'd take back everything they stole from us.

And Leo? He became something I never expected ‚Äì an ally who didn't flinch from my darkness.

He didn't just give me a room. He pushed me past my limits, challenged every assumption, forced me to think bigger.

""You've got more raw talent than most of the C-suite idiots in Manhattan,"" he said one night, watching me debug a complex trading algorithm. ""Stop playing small.""

I met his gaze in the screen's reflection. ""I'm not playing at all.""

And I wasn't.

Three years transformed me into someone else entirely.

The mirror showed a stranger in a tailored black blazer that cost more than my old monthly salary.

The broken girl who'd collapsed on the street was gone.

In her place stood Elara Quinn, CEO of Phoenix Technologies.

Self-made billionaire. Digital revolutionary.

The woman who made Sterling Enterprises look like a relic.

I turned away from my reflection to watch Livia, my beautiful girl, now three and full of life, playing with her favorite teddy on the bed.

Her smile lit up the room. ""Mommy pretty.""

Love and fierce protectiveness surged through me.

I knelt down, smoothing back her dark curls. ""And you're my little warrior, aren't you?""

Her giggle was pure sunshine.

After kissing her forehead, I stood, smoothing my jacket. ""Ready to travel with Mommy?"" She answered with a man eager nod that cause me to smile even more.

Leo lounged against the doorframe, arms crossed. ""Sure you want to do this?""

I met his steady gaze. ""More than I've ever been sure of anything.""

His smirk held equal parts pride and danger. ""Then let‚Äôs go show them what rising from the ashes really means.""

I grabbed I and my daughter‚Äôs traveling box, walked out into the morning sun with both Livia and Leo on my side, and boarded a private jet to New York.

To Damon Sterling.

To revenge.

1kzt0ve,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzt0ve,Mastering Consent: How to Communicate in Your Sex Life,"Hey r/OneXIndia,Let‚Äôs talk about something super important for a healthy and enjoyable sex life: consent and communication. In India, where cultural norms can sometimes make these conversations feel awkward, mastering how to discuss boundaries, desires, and comfort levels with your partner is a game-changer. Whether you‚Äôre single, dating, or in a long-term relationship, clear communication builds trust and makes intimacy more fulfilling. Here‚Äôs a guide to get started, plus I‚Äôd love to hear your tips and experiences!

A. Why Consent and Communication Matter: Consent isn‚Äôt just a one-time ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs an ongoing, enthusiastic agreement between partners. Good communication ensures both you and your partner feel safe, respected, and heard, which can lead to better connection and pleasure. In the Indian context, where sex talks can feel taboo, learning to navigate this respectfully is key.

B. Tips for Mastering Consent and Communication

1.Start the Conversation Early: Bring up boundaries and preferences outside the bedroom, like over coffee or during a chill moment. Try something like, ‚ÄúHey, I want us to feel totally comfortable‚Äîwhat do you enjoy or feel okay with?‚Äù This sets a relaxed tone.

2. Be Clear and Direct: Avoid vague hints. If you‚Äôre comfortable with certain acts or want to try something new, say it clearly (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to explore [X], what do you think?‚Äù). If something‚Äôs off-limits, state it confidently (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into [Y], but I‚Äôm open to other things‚Äù).

3. Check In Regularly: Consent can change, even during intimacy. Ask simple questions like, ‚ÄúIs this okay?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you enjoying this?‚Äù It shows you care about your partner‚Äôs comfort.

4. Listen Actively: Pay attention to your partner‚Äôs verbal and non-verbal cues (e.g., body language, hesitation). If they seem unsure, pause and ask, ‚ÄúDo you want to keep going or take a break?‚Äù

5. Respect Boundaries Without Judgment: If your partner says no to something, respect it gracefully. A response like, ‚ÄúThanks for letting me know, let‚Äôs try something we both love,‚Äù keeps things positive.

6. Use Humor to Ease Awkwardness: In India, where sex talks can feel heavy, light humor can help. For example, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs make a deal: we both say what we‚Äôre cool with, no judgment!‚Äù

7. Learn to Say No Confidently: It‚Äôs okay to set your own boundaries. Practice phrases like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for that, but I‚Äôm happy to do [Z] instead.‚Äù It‚Äôs empowering and builds mutual respect.

8. Educate Yourself: Check out resources like online sexual health platforms (e.g., Love Matters India) or books like Come As You Are for tips on communication and intimacy.

C. Navigating Cultural Challenges in India: 
Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîdiscussing sex can feel tricky in India due to cultural taboos or family expectations. But small steps, like having private, honest chats with your partner or seeking advice from trusted sources, can break the stigma. Consent isn‚Äôt just about avoiding harm; it‚Äôs about creating a space where both partners feel valued.

D. Questions for the Community

1.How do you bring up consent or boundaries with a partner without it feeling awkward?

2.Any go-to phrases or approaches that work for you in these conversations?

3.How do you handle cultural pressures or shyness when discussing sex in India?

4.Any Indian-specific resources (apps, websites, or helplines) you recommend for learning about sexual communication?

Let‚Äôs keep this respectful and share practical tips to make our sex lives safer, happier, and more connected. Thanks for contributing to an open and healthy discussion!",18,1748683679.0,onexindia,11,0.95,False

Had to use pre-ground coffee in a pressurised basket until I got a grinder that could grind for Espresso. I was previously using a De'Longhi KG79 for filter coffee.

After having a lot of my time wasted by someone selling a used Niche Zero online (would've been about $300), I gave up and bought a Baratza Encore ESP.

Just with that machine its changed my morning coffees x100. Im still dialling in my bag of coffee. Its difficult as Im the only coffee drinker and only have 1 drink a day so its been a slow process and unless its coming out a watery mess I dont want to waste it.

I've managed to get it to a 1:1 ratio so I need to grind slightly coarser however the taste is great, lots of flavor and smooth. So im wondering after a few more days of adjusting, will a 1:2 shot taste a lot better and in what ways?

Additional question: I've got beginner level equipment here compared to a lot of you and havent even fully dialled in my coffee and its still some of the best I've had. Can it get that much better?

So TLDR: I really like my 1:1 shot and dialling in takes me a while as its 1 drink a day. Will a 1:2 shot taste a lot better?",1,1748683588.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Some important background information, I'm a mature undergrad student (29f), and we met during a university event. We began working together on a project, but I wasn't directly reporting to her. She is older, I think in her early 40s, but I haven‚Äôt asked for an age. 

I felt safe with her, and I suppose I began to _fall_ for her. Not once did she do anything inappropriate, but overtime I found myself drawn to her intelligence and to her kindness. She probably views me in a strictly maternal capacity, but I'm crushing on her. 

I know it's a common experience to have feelings for your professor, but this is the first time it's happened to me. This is also _the_ experience which caused me to question my sexuality in adulthood. I come from a religious and conservative family, and I've suppressed my sexuality my entire adult life. It's been surprise, after surprise, after surprise. 

We've also met up for coffee, and I can't help but wonder if she knows. I've tried my best to conceal my feelings, but I suspect that she might be aware.  _(There was an incident when were working on the project)_

She is the one of the most supportive professors I've met, and I don't want to jeopardise our professional relationship _just because_ of a stupid crush. She has a male partner (although I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs bi), but even if she didn't or even if they were open, nothing could ever happen between the two of us ‚Ä¶ right? 

Or nothing _should_ happen between the two of us?

There was this guy, probably in his late 30s, who seemed all cheerful and nice to the friend he was with but then got super short with the barista when his order was taking a bit longer. Like, total switch in demeanor once he was at the counter. Got me thinking about how we often unconsciously project our mood or sense of status onto the folks serving us. 

I wonder why some people feel the need to act superior or more impatient when the only thing that‚Äôs changed is who they're talking to. Maybe it‚Äôs the whole power dynamic? Since they‚Äôre in a position of 'customer', they might feel like they have to assert some kinda authority. It's like that thing where people‚Äôs true colors show depending on how they treat someone who's not directly in their 'circle.' 

Maybe it's about feeling like they need control in a stressful day by being a bit more confrontational? My friend once mentioned it‚Äôs similar to that, where folks who perceive themselves as higher status tend to have less patience for things like service delays.

The subject, namely myself, embarked on a brief yet intense course of exposure to meticulously curated social media content (read: scrolling Instagram while sipping coffee). The ocular reception of successive images of others' life milestones‚Äîranging from seemingly ubiquitous vacation photos to the hallucinogenic crispness of perfectly plated brunches‚Äîalways starts with a mild physiological response: my heart rate ticks up approximately 2 beats per minute, signifying Phase 1: Engagement.

This preliminary phase gives way to the second, more volatile phase where I initiate a semi-conscious schema for resource comparison, tentatively dubbed 'The Compare and Despair Hypothesis'. During this phase, neural pathways associated with self-perception become activated. If quantified (hypothetical, but bear with me), it feels like subtracting my current life satisfaction index by an arbitrary variable 'z' (representing perceived peer success). The sorcery of cognitive dissonance commences.

Curiously, I noted that during Phase 2, there's a peculiar cyclical loop where hard-earned logical reasoning ('I don't even like avocados that much') clashes bravely against longer-standing emotional responses ('Why does her toast look so life-affirming?'), producing a 'twitch feed contra-affirmation' phenomenon. The disquieting crescendo of perceived inadequacy peaks when encountering hyperbolized 'influence' content, which I've set at an intensity level of 7 on my 'Jealousy Gauge', unexpectedly measured against the emotional availability of my cat's affection as a surprisingly firm counterbalance.

Concluding this experiment in quantifying momentary jealousy, it appears that the most compelling variable in modulating my jealousy index remains the availability of logical self-reappraisal, though humor does help knock it back down by at least 0.5 'ego units'. Perhaps avoiding elaborately crafted external narratives could be beneficial... at least until post-coffee contemplation periods resume.

My PCP referred me, I didn't necessarily want to be but they also referred me to therapy w a LCSW too. After 2 sessions with my psychiatrist she asked me if id done any drugs and I was honest cause I had lapsed after a two weeks abstinence and done a bump the day before. Anyway I told her I don't do it all the time, just occasionally sometimes a few more times, sometimes less but sometimes when I'm in crisis I turn to it.
So, when I say that she kind of gives this tiny bit of an eye roll with a full stop of what she's doing with some kind of breath thing blown out and says in a very strict tone "" Well you're gonna have to get help it can affect youreds"" and I said Ok. 
After I left her office and a couple weeks later looked aty medical records,I find my record of my visit with her full.pfberrors and lies and that its grossly embellished with things she did after I left and I can't believe how badly she lied. There are a least 15 statements and errors in the record and I am PO'd .How can a healthcare provider get so much wrong and the btch of it is she taped the whole thing on her personal phone and said I consented to ""ambient listening"" and I did no such thing. She told me when she grabbed that phone she was turning it off. I think she lied. She had that session w me over quick and before I got downstairs from checking out of the appt and making my next one, she was out of the building leaving before me. I absolutely don't want to go to another psychiatrist. There's all kinds of things she did to me that she stated I agreed to. She took my meds from me but wrote that she had taken them because I told her I had lapsed and she never said that. She cancelled out all my meds but stayed I would come to her for 6 months dropping each time and being sober before I got my meds back. 
Well, it only took the eye roll and little breath sound for that session to be over in my mind. A couple days after I left it kept wearing on me how she acted plus the thoughts of having a social worker as my therapist after drugs were admitted to didn't sit well with me because I'm not being forced into anything by medical professionals and I'm certainly not being railroaded or took to court. I'm having a crisis and I trusted these people but I have a feeling I can see where this was going and it wasn't good. I think they were aiming for trying to questiony capacity and run me into legal issues. So I cancelled my sessions due to some transportation issues I was gonna have in getting there from them on and I haven't been back. I asked my PCP for telehealth but I don't want to continue w a psychiatrist or talk therapy. I'd rather discuss my issues w my preacher. I don't agree with therapy anyway.
Now my insurance company is giving me every inkling it's gonna drop me and I am wanting to send this psychiatrist a letter about how she needs to correct everything I wrote down that she lied about or just got plain wrong. She wrote stupid sht in there like that I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and I don't and never have and we never even had a discussion on it but she said I ADMITTED it, like it is a bad thing. What am I on probation cause she gave me consequences by taking my meds but she never told me this to my face she did all this after I left, or after I cancelled her one. I know she could tell I got upset after her little outburst at me cause I started crying and wouldn't talk anymore. I am such an emotional wreck from the events that put me at the DR anyway, I certainly can't handle any more sht. I'm just still such a wreck.
I'm afraid if I send the letter she will retaliate and tell the cops or the judge I was using. Should I ask for these corrections cause I don't want to stand for a bunch of lies, errors and embellishments.

I do like nice graphics, but tbh I prefer smooth experience over graphics. (For example, I really liked Wu Long Fallen Dynasty even though lots of ppl criticised it looks like ps3 era) 

I do not have that much time as before when a teenager, given work, wife (who supports me gaming in free time nevertheless) 
Now, my life situation have further changed a lot, as I have become a father. 

Now to sum up. I do like to play, I do not need to do it daily, I have more important matters that give lots of joy, but still I like to play for a while. 
I have recently been reading and watching a lot about handheld consoles. I was wondering if it could be better option for me now. 
I was thinking, I could play short sessions when kiddo is sleeping, I could play it on a sofa as I like. Even better I could take it up, make a coffee and play on my balcony on a summer morning/evening. 

I am waiting for this Asus-Xbox partnership. If they really make the UI more convenient this could be great. Alternatively maybe I'd go with Steam Deck or Rog Ally (but Steam deck seems better having option to resume and play) 

What's your thoughts on the matter? Anyone in similar situation? Could handheld really proof to be more convenient then home console?

Well, this is a new one. Ordered some Stagg filters expecting, you know, actual filters. Instead I apparently received someone's avant-garde interpretation of ""deconstructed coffee brewing.""

These things look like they've been through a paper accordion factory. I'm half expecting them to unfold into a crane or spell out a haiku about extraction ratios.

Part of me wonders if this is Fellow's secret beta test for ""textured brewing surfaces"" and I'm an unwitting guinea pig. The other part just wants filters that don't look like expensive crumpled napkins.

So, fellow caffeine addicts: do I embrace my new role as a coffee filter origami artist, or do I politely ask the seller why my filters went through what appears to be paper martial arts training?

I'm going to show you cheap and affordable food and snacks. Something to cheer us up!  
This week I've been really depressed, both about my health and the doctor's response at my last appointment. When you turn 50, life really becomes more sensitive and less intense. Before, you took things more calmly and didn't worry as much. When you reach adulthood, you start thinking about everything and worry a lot. That depresses you. So, cheer up!

¬°Hola! Bienvenidos a un nuevo video. Muchas gracias a los nuevos suscriptores de mi canal.

Esta semana he estado muy deprimido, tanto por mi salud como por la respuesta del m√©dico en mi √∫ltima cita. Cuando cumples 50, la verdad es que la vida se vuelve m√°s sensible y menos intensa. Antes, te tomabas las cosas con m√°s calma y ya no te preocupabas tanto. Cuando llegas a la edad adulta, empiezas a pensar en todo, y te preocupas mucho. Eso te deprime. ¬°As√≠ que, √°nimo!

I am impressed with its sound quality. The ANC is acceptable for me; I still can enjoy my music fully when sitting in a coffee shop located in a crowded department store. Actually, I am also fine in the same situation with the off mode. The pass-through mode is also good. The remaining one thing is to see how good it performs in the plane. That has to wait for a month. However, I have some questions as follows:

1. I feel that the sound quality is getting better and better. I am not sure if this is normal or not. I listened to the same song with the same mode, and it sounds fuller gradually from day one. Does anyone else feel the same?

2. I use it with my iPhone 16 ProMax with Apple Music. I read somewhere that when you listen from an iPhone wirelessly, the maximum quality you get from the song is the lossless level. But I saw a song which shows ‚ÄúHi-res Lossless‚Äù even when I connect it wirelessly, and the sound quality is also quite good. My question is what really is the limit of the S3 sound quality when used wirelessly?

3. Are there any differences between the songs labeled ‚ÄúHi-res Lossless‚Äùand ‚ÄúDolby Atmos‚Äù ?

4. If I want the best possible sound quality while using wired connection between my iPhone and the S3, what should I do? And how much better is that method when comparing with using the B&W-supplied usb cable which comes with the box? 

I like Fusion jazz, Blues and ‚Äò70-80s pop songs.

Even typing it out feels weird, like I‚Äôm about to break some rule I don‚Äôt understand. But here I am. I guess I just need to see if anyone else has felt something like this.

It happened at exactly 2:16 AM. I know that for sure because I had just checked my phone. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I was lying there in bed, scrolling through the usual endless feed. Everything was normal until suddenly it wasn‚Äôt. The room didn‚Äôt get cold. Nothing jumped out of the shadows. It was like the whole world took a really long pause.

It was so quiet, it hurt my ears. I didn‚Äôt notice the silence at first. It was more like the background hum of everything‚Äîmy fridge, the cars outside, the wind‚Äîjust faded out. Even the glow from my phone screen seemed kind of muted. For a second I wondered if I‚Äôd lost my hearing or if maybe I was dreaming.

I got up, feeling stupid and restless, and walked over to the window. The street outside looked like a photograph. A car was stopped right in the intersection, headlights catching the mist. I swear I saw a cat in mid-leap just above a trash can. Nobody moved. Nothing moved. I remember tapping the glass just to see if anything would react. Nothing did.

I started feeling unsettled, but it wasn‚Äôt fear exactly. It was like something was watching to see what I‚Äôd do. I wandered out of my room, walked through the apartment. All the clocks were stuck on 2:16, not just my phone. The red digits on the microwave, the ancient wall clock in the hallway, my wristwatch I never wear‚Äîeverything frozen.

I kept going, out into the hallway. Every door was closed except one down at the end. I know my neighbors and that door is never open. I walked toward it, telling myself I was just curious, not completely losing it. The air felt thicker the closer I got, almost like walking into a steam room. My skin prickled.

Inside that open doorway, it was pitch black. Not a normal darkness, but the kind that makes you feel like if you step through, you won‚Äôt come back. Standing right outside was this little kid. I‚Äôve never seen her before. She looked up at me, almost bored, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Not a question, more like a statement she didn‚Äôt care if I agreed with.

I said something dumb like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù She smiled, the tiniest little grin, and said, ‚ÄúThis is the space before morning. Most people sleep through it, even if their eyes are open.‚Äù I asked her if I was dreaming and she shrugged, picked up a piece of chalk from her pocket, and started drawing shapes on the hallway wall.

It hit me then that I could feel my heart pounding, my breath in my chest, the floor under my feet. I was there, actually there, in a way I don‚Äôt remember feeling in years. She drew a circle, looked up at me again, and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. When it starts again, you‚Äôll remember.‚Äù

I wanted to ask her what she meant, but before I could, I blinked and the lights came back. The clocks ticked forward to 2:17. The street outside was moving again. The fridge kicked on. My phone vibrated. It was like nothing happened, except everything felt different.

Today, everything has a kind of shine to it. People made eye contact on the sidewalk. I noticed a bird‚Äôs song and actually listened. My coffee tasted stronger. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it except that now, I‚Äôm paying attention. I keep thinking about that kid and the way she said I‚Äôd remember.

I don‚Äôt know if any of this makes sense. Maybe I finally lost it. But if you‚Äôre reading this, and you felt something weird last night, please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one. Even if you just noticed the silence, or the way the world seemed to pause.

Maybe we just woke up.

I keep replaying that moment, standing in the hallway, trying to remember the exact way she looked at me. It‚Äôs like some part of me has been waiting for that feeling my whole life‚Äîthe sense that there‚Äôs more, and that ‚Äúmore‚Äù isn‚Äôt some big revelation or secret knowledge. It‚Äôs just this, right here. Being present. Actually seeing the world instead of just moving through it half-asleep.

I‚Äôm not saying I understand what happened. Hell, maybe nothing did. Maybe it‚Äôs all a trick of a tired mind and a weird night. But something deep down feels different. Things are sharper. Realer. I notice little kindnesses, tiny details. People‚Äôs faces look new.

So here‚Äôs the honest part: If you‚Äôve been waiting for a sign, for some moment to say ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôm finally ready‚Äù‚Äîmaybe this is it. I think I am. I‚Äôm tired of living on autopilot. I want to notice things. I want to actually be here, even if it‚Äôs hard.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you felt that same pause, or even if you just want to believe that waking up is possible‚Äîlet‚Äôs just agree, right now, to not sleepwalk through whatever comes next.

Maybe this is what it means to finally be awake.

If you‚Äôre with me, leave a reply. Even if it‚Äôs just to say you saw the same thing, or you want to. I don‚Äôt want to forget, and I don‚Äôt want to be the only one. Maybe that‚Äôs how it starts.

It was nothing crazy, he just lashed out, threw things around and told me to sleep on the couch. He left the day after  without a word and a few days after that  he told me he wanted a divorce. For the 3rd time in 1 year. I was devastated. I cried a lot. He deleted me on facebook, and put his relationship status as seperated. In the mean time a friend of mine told me he was seperating from his wife, and I told him I get what he was going through, that i was in a similar situation. He asked me to meet for coffee, I said yes and we talked. Mostly about our situation, especially about his. Since then he has been texting me almost daily. At the beginning i wasn't sure why, i thought he might feel lonely... but now I know he has interest for me. Unfortunately I do, too. Today I told him I like being around him, but that i am still married and in a delicate situation and that I won't start dating anyone or doing anything.
My husband, well..
...since he came back he acted like nothing happened, he gave  effort to reconcile and tells me he loves me. I am in a lot.of pain, I don't understand what is happening and I struggle talking about it..I am.trying to find a job, the be financially more independent. I just cant act like nothing happened, my husband doesnt really want to talk about what happened when I try to talk about his divorce threats.. but what is really laying heavy on me is that I am texting with a male friend that I see almost daily, since we train at the same gym. I feel so guilty and extremely anxious, and I wish I would have never met him for coffee and talked about my situation at home. It was very naive from me and my guilt is huge.

So, I got down at Al Qusais Metro Station this morning, and as I was waiting for the 13 bus, I noticed a stray cat nearby. It was obviously thirsty and hungry, but there were no shops or facilities around other than a petrol station up the road and the usual metro vending machines and a general store. I started looking for a water dispenser the free ones you often see in public spaces. I spotted one in front of the metro entrance, but it was completely broken down. The only options left were the vending machines, but my bus arrived just then, and I couldn‚Äôt afford to miss it.

I‚Äôm and Indian Expatriate who grew up in Kuwait, and one thing that always stood out there was the abundance of free water dispensers often Ice cold water and every building, even at the edge of private properties. Sometimes, you‚Äôd even find free fridges stocked with drinks and snacks to help people beat the heat. It wasn‚Äôt a government thing, just the community stepping up.

1kzs6nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzs6nm/i_27nb_am_in_love_with_my_friend_29m_who_has_just/,I (27NB) am in love with my friend (29M) who has just moved away. Seeking advice on how to move forward given the circumstances.,"This is a long story (see end for summary). 

I (27NB) moved countries six months ago for a grad school program. Through a series of very sweet coincidences, I ended up meeting my friend (29M) just two days after I arrived in the country. He asked me to go out for tea/coffee with him, but I told him it would have to wait until the next week, as I was busy with moving activities until then. We spoke over text every day that week until we could finally meet up. 

It became very quickly obvious that we were attracted to one another, and that we also had a great personal connection with shared values and interests. He was upfront about the fact that he would be moving in six months, to another city in the same country (about 80 minutes and fairly cheap by plane). We decided that the connection was worth pursuing despite this, until the time came for him to move. He was clear about not wanting a long distance relationship afterwards, and I respected that.

For the past six months, we‚Äôve spoken every day and spent nearly every weekend together. We became very close with each other, both physically and emotionally. With him, I feel a sense of childlike joy that I thought I wouldn‚Äôt get to feel again. I realized that over the course of our six months together, we had developed a beautiful relationship that wasn‚Äôt just rooted in attraction, but genuine friendship. I feel like he could be the love of my life, and also the best friend I‚Äôve ever had. I come from a past of complex relationships (some of them abusive) and what I have with him is unlike any connection I‚Äôve had before. He makes me feel calm and safe, and was very supportive when I shared my past trauma.

We discussed a couple months ago and decided to remain friends after he leaves. However, as the time approached to say goodbye, it was clear that we both were feeling sad for our time together to end. On our last day together, I told him the truth about the depth of my emotions for him, but also maintained my respect that he didn‚Äôt want to pursue the connection long term. 

He responded by saying we could continue speaking and could video call one another. He also suggested that I come to visit him and that he could come to visit me. We cried together and I gave him a poem I wrote about him before we parted ways.

The thing is, at the end, he was questioning his decision to move and he didn‚Äôt seem confident about not wanting to continue our relationship after he leaves, while I had been preparing for a clean-ish break. I didn‚Äôt tell him this, because I didn‚Äôt think it would be sensible, but I would have completed the rest of my academic year here and worked remotely in his city to be with him, if that‚Äôs something he was open to. 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering what the best way forward would be from now on? I‚Äôm absolutely devastated that he‚Äôs gone, and definitely want to continue being friends, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs healthy for us to be video calling and visiting one another now that our relationship has come to a close. On the other hand, he could just be conflicted and need more time to figure out what he wants to do. 

So, should I continue connecting with him more regularly/intimately and visiting with him, with the hope that he has a change of heart about being together long term? 

And, should I have told him I was willing to move cities to be with him, if he was open to it? 

TL;DR my (27NB) friend (29M) and I had an intense short term relationship for six months before he moved to another city. We care about each other deeply, are attracted to one another, and are also great friends. Should I try to keep up a relationship with him now that he‚Äôs leaving, should we stay friends, and/or should I tell him I‚Äôm open to moving to be with him, if that‚Äôs what he wants?

For context, I have the Priority Pass Select membership through my Chase Sapphire Reserve (CSR).

First stop: Medell√≠n (MDE)I was flying domestically and had two lounge options: The Lounge and The Harmony Lounge, both located on the third floor between Gates 1 and 2. I chose The Harmony Lounge because of its more inviting exterior‚Äîand I was pleasantly surprised. Despite its small size, the lounge was quite comfortable. Amenities included:
* Coffee from a standard lounge machine
* Bottled soft drinks
* Self-service alcohol
* A selection of fruits and sweets
* Pasta and soup (which I didn‚Äôt try as I had eaten beforehand)

Next stop: Santa Marta (SMR)This is a much smaller airport, and there‚Äôs only one lounge available: The Lounge. It's extremely compact but still provides a welcome break from the crowded terminal. Offerings were similar to Medell√≠n:
* Pasta, soup, and light snacks
* Bottled drinks and coffee machine
* Self-service alcohol
* A QR code linking to a small food menu:
    * Lunch options: pasta with meat or rice with meat
    * Dinner option: grilled ham and cheese sandwich (basic but tasty)
There‚Äôs a good YouTube review of this lounge if you're curious to see just how small it is. If you have Priority Pass, it‚Äôs worth stopping by, but I personally wouldn‚Äôt pay out of pocket for access.

Layover: Bogot√° (BOG)Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have time to visit any lounges during my layover here, so I can't share any insights.

I didn‚Äôt encounter any wait times at either lounge and was able to bring one guest with me on each visit.Feel free to ask if you have any questions about these two lounges.",0,1748680081.0,PriorityPass,1,0.5,False

1kzs26j,https://i.redd.it/ka9mae89u24f1.jpeg,Wild Mushroom Magic - Dehydrate & Powder Power!,"Today, we're diving into the amazing world of wild mushrooms! These nutritional powerhouses are packed with flavour and can elevate your WFPB meals to the next level.

Once you've got your hands on some beautiful, safe wild mushrooms, what's next? Well, fresh mushrooms are amazing, but they don't last forever. That's where our trusty Ninja Airfryer comes in! Today, I'm going to show you how to easily dehydrate wild mushrooms and then transform them into an incredibly versatile and flavourful mushroom powder. This stuff is like magic dust for your WFPB kitchen!

Full video guide here‚Ä¶ https://youtu.be/n0Lm1hJVn8g

Part 1: Why Dehydrate Wild Mushrooms?
So, why bother dehydrating? Great question!
 * Preservation: Dehydration extends the shelf life of your precious mushrooms by months, even up to a year if stored properly. No more worrying about them going slimy in the fridge!
 * Concentrated Flavour: The dehydration process intensifies that amazing umami flavour mushrooms are famous for. A little goes a long way!
 * Nutrient Retention: While some very sensitive vitamins might slightly decrease, dehydration is generally a great way to preserve most of the mushrooms' nutritional goodness, like B vitamins, selenium, and potassium.
 * Versatility: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated for use in soups, stews, and saut√©s, or, as we'll see today, powdered for an instant flavour boost.
 * Space Saving: A huge basket of fresh mushrooms shrinks down significantly once dried, saving you precious pantry space.

Part 2: Prepping Your Wild Mushrooms for Dehydration
Hibby: Alright, let's get these beauties ready for their drying session.
 * Cleaning is Key: Wild mushrooms can be a bit... earthy. Avoid soaking them in water if you can, as they'll absorb too much moisture, prolonging drying time. A soft brush, a damp paper towel, or a quick rinse followed by thorough patting dry is usually best. For some varieties with lots of nooks and crannies, a very quick dunk and immediate dry might be necessary.
 * Slicing for Success: Uniformity is your friend here. Slice your mushrooms to a consistent thickness. I recommend about 1/4 inch or roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Thicker slices will take longer to dry, and uneven slices mean some bits might be damp while others are overly dry.

   * Pro Tip: For smaller mushrooms, you might be able to leave them whole or just halve them. Use your judgment based on their size and density.

Part 3: Dehydrating in Your Ninja Airfryer

Now for the magic of the Ninja Airfryer! Most Ninja models with a dehydrate function work brilliantly for this.

 * Arranging on Trays: Lay your sliced mushrooms in a single layer on your Ninja Airfryer's dehydrating racks (or air fry basket if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre using ‚Äì though racks are better for airflow). Don't overcrowd them! Good air circulation is crucial for even drying. You might need to work in batches depending on how many mushrooms you have.

 * Setting the Temperature: We're aiming for a low and slow approach to preserve those nutrients and flavours. Set your Ninja Airfryer to the Dehydrate function. The ideal temperature range for mushrooms is typically between 110-125¬∞F (or about 43-52¬∞C). Check your Ninja's manual for its specific dehydrate settings, but this is a good general range. If your model has a specific ""mushroom"" setting, even better!

 * Time to Dry: This is where patience comes in, folks! Dehydrating mushrooms can take anywhere from 4 to 10 hours, sometimes even longer, depending on:
   * The type of mushroom (some have higher water content).
   * The thickness of your slices.
   * The humidity in your kitchen.
   * Your specific Airfryer model.
 * Checking for Doneness: Start checking your mushrooms around the 4-hour mark, and then every hour or so after that. They're ready when they are ""leathery"" to ""crisp"" dry. They should feel dry to the touch and snap easily if you try to bend them (especially if aiming for powder). If they still feel pliable or damp, they need more time.
   * Important: It's better to slightly over-dry than under-dry, as any remaining moisture can lead to spoilage.

Part 4: Conditioning & Storing Your Dried Mushrooms
Hibby: Once your mushrooms are perfectly dehydrated, there's one more important step called ""conditioning.""
 * Cool Completely: Let the dried mushrooms cool completely before storing.
 * Conditioning: Place the cooled, dried mushrooms into an airtight glass jar, filling it about two-thirds full. For the next few days, shake the jar once or twice a day. This helps to distribute any residual moisture evenly among the pieces. If you see any condensation forming inside the jar, the mushrooms aren't dry enough and need to go back into the dehydrator for a bit longer.
 * Proper Storage: Once conditioned and confirmed dry, store your dehydrated mushrooms in airtight containers (glass jars are perfect) in a cool, dark, and dry place. Away from direct sunlight and heat. Properly stored, they can last for many months, even up to a year!

Part 5: Creating Wild Mushroom Powder.
Okay, team, now for the really exciting part ‚Äì transforming these flavour bombs into an incredible mushroom powder! This is where the culinary magic happens.
 * Ensure They're CRISP Dry: For powder, your mushrooms need to be absolutely cracker-dry. If they have any bend or chewiness, they won't powder well. If needed, pop them back in the Ninja on dehydrate for another hour or two until they snap.
 * Choose Your Weapon (Grinder):
   * Spice Grinder/Coffee Grinder: A dedicated coffee grinder that you use only for spices is perfect for this. Don't use the one you use for coffee beans unless you want mushroom-flavoured coffee (or vice-versa!).
   * High-Powered Blender: A good quality blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec, or even the Ninja blender attachment if it's powerful enough) can also work, especially for larger batches. You'll need to use the smallest blending cup if possible for finer results.
 * Grind in Batches: Don't overload your grinder. Work in small batches for the finest, most consistent powder.
 * Pulse and Grind: Pulse a few times to break up the larger pieces, then grind until you achieve a fine powder.
   * Safety Tip: Let the powder settle in the grinder for a minute or two before opening the lid to avoid a mushroom dust cloud! You can even drape a damp paper towel over the lid as an extra precaution.
 * Sieve: For an ultra-fine powder, you can sift it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any larger bits. These can be re-ground or just tossed into your next soup.

 * Storing Your Mushroom Powder: Store your beautiful homemade mushroom powder in a small, airtight jar, again in a cool, dark, dry place. It's even more susceptible to moisture than whole dried mushrooms, so a good seal is vital. It will last for months, retaining amazing flavour.
Part 6: How to Use Your Wild Mushroom Powder (WFPB Style!). 
Now for the fun part ‚Äì how do we use this incredible WFPB flavour enhancer? The possibilities are endless!

 * Soups & Stews: Whisk it into broths for an instant depth of flavour. Amazing in lentil soup, bean chilli, or vegetable stews.
 * Sauces & Gravies: Adds a rich, savoury, umami kick to your plant-based sauces and gravies. Perfect for mushroom gravy without needing fresh mushrooms!
 * Seasoning Blends: Mix it with other herbs and spices to create your own unique seasoning blends for tofu, tempeh, roasted vegetables, or potatoes.
 * ""No-Cheese"" Sprinkles: Combine with nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt for a savoury sprinkle over pasta, popcorn, or salads.
 * Burgers & Loaves: Add a tablespoon or two to your homemade veggie burger patties or lentil loaves for an extra layer of deliciousness.
 * Dips & Spreads: Mix into hummus, cashew cream, or bean dips.
 * Bread & Savoury Bakes: You can even incorporate a little into savoury bread doughs or muffin recipes!

Seriously, this wild mushroom powder is a game-changer for adding complex, savoury notes to your WFPB cooking without any oil, salt, or processed ingredients if you choose. It‚Äôs pure, concentrated mushroom goodness!",0,1748679602.0,foraging,0,0.4,False

Part 1: Why Dehydrate Wild Mushrooms?
So, why bother dehydrating? Great question!
 * Preservation: Dehydration extends the shelf life of your precious mushrooms by months, even up to a year if stored properly. No more worrying about them going slimy in the fridge!
 * Concentrated Flavour: The dehydration process intensifies that amazing umami flavour mushrooms are famous for. A little goes a long way!
 * Nutrient Retention: While some very sensitive vitamins might slightly decrease, dehydration is generally a great way to preserve most of the mushrooms' nutritional goodness, like B vitamins, selenium, and potassium.
 * Versatility: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated for use in soups, stews, and saut√©s, or, as we'll see today, powdered for an instant flavour boost.
 * Space Saving: A huge basket of fresh mushrooms shrinks down significantly once dried, saving you precious pantry space.

Part 2: Prepping Your Wild Mushrooms for Dehydration
Hibby: Alright, let's get these beauties ready for their drying session.
 * Cleaning is Key: Wild mushrooms can be a bit... earthy. Avoid soaking them in water if you can, as they'll absorb too much moisture, prolonging drying time. A soft brush, a damp paper towel, or a quick rinse followed by thorough patting dry is usually best. For some varieties with lots of nooks and crannies, a very quick dunk and immediate dry might be necessary.
 * Slicing for Success: Uniformity is your friend here. Slice your mushrooms to a consistent thickness. I recommend about 1/4 inch or roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Thicker slices will take longer to dry, and uneven slices mean some bits might be damp while others are overly dry.

   * Pro Tip: For smaller mushrooms, you might be able to leave them whole or just halve them. Use your judgment based on their size and density.

Part 3: Dehydrating in Your Ninja Airfryer

Now for the magic of the Ninja Airfryer! Most Ninja models with a dehydrate function work brilliantly for this.

 * Arranging on Trays: Lay your sliced mushrooms in a single layer on your Ninja Airfryer's dehydrating racks (or air fry basket if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre using ‚Äì though racks are better for airflow). Don't overcrowd them! Good air circulation is crucial for even drying. You might need to work in batches depending on how many mushrooms you have.

 * Setting the Temperature: We're aiming for a low and slow approach to preserve those nutrients and flavours. Set your Ninja Airfryer to the Dehydrate function. The ideal temperature range for mushrooms is typically between 110-125¬∞F (or about 43-52¬∞C). Check your Ninja's manual for its specific dehydrate settings, but this is a good general range. If your model has a specific ""mushroom"" setting, even better!

 * Time to Dry: This is where patience comes in, folks! Dehydrating mushrooms can take anywhere from 4 to 10 hours, sometimes even longer, depending on:
   * The type of mushroom (some have higher water content).
   * The thickness of your slices.
   * The humidity in your kitchen.
   * Your specific Airfryer model.
 * Checking for Doneness: Start checking your mushrooms around the 4-hour mark, and then every hour or so after that. They're ready when they are ""leathery"" to ""crisp"" dry. They should feel dry to the touch and snap easily if you try to bend them (especially if aiming for powder). If they still feel pliable or damp, they need more time.
   * Important: It's better to slightly over-dry than under-dry, as any remaining moisture can lead to spoilage.

Part 4: Conditioning & Storing Your Dried Mushrooms
Hibby: Once your mushrooms are perfectly dehydrated, there's one more important step called ""conditioning.""
 * Cool Completely: Let the dried mushrooms cool completely before storing.
 * Conditioning: Place the cooled, dried mushrooms into an airtight glass jar, filling it about two-thirds full. For the next few days, shake the jar once or twice a day. This helps to distribute any residual moisture evenly among the pieces. If you see any condensation forming inside the jar, the mushrooms aren't dry enough and need to go back into the dehydrator for a bit longer.
 * Proper Storage: Once conditioned and confirmed dry, store your dehydrated mushrooms in airtight containers (glass jars are perfect) in a cool, dark, and dry place. Away from direct sunlight and heat. Properly stored, they can last for many months, even up to a year!

Part 5: Creating Wild Mushroom Powder.
Okay, team, now for the really exciting part ‚Äì transforming these flavour bombs into an incredible mushroom powder! This is where the culinary magic happens.
 * Ensure They're CRISP Dry: For powder, your mushrooms need to be absolutely cracker-dry. If they have any bend or chewiness, they won't powder well. If needed, pop them back in the Ninja on dehydrate for another hour or two until they snap.
 * Choose Your Weapon (Grinder):
   * Spice Grinder/Coffee Grinder: A dedicated coffee grinder that you use only for spices is perfect for this. Don't use the one you use for coffee beans unless you want mushroom-flavoured coffee (or vice-versa!).
   * High-Powered Blender: A good quality blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec, or even the Ninja blender attachment if it's powerful enough) can also work, especially for larger batches. You'll need to use the smallest blending cup if possible for finer results.
 * Grind in Batches: Don't overload your grinder. Work in small batches for the finest, most consistent powder.
 * Pulse and Grind: Pulse a few times to break up the larger pieces, then grind until you achieve a fine powder.
   * Safety Tip: Let the powder settle in the grinder for a minute or two before opening the lid to avoid a mushroom dust cloud! You can even drape a damp paper towel over the lid as an extra precaution.
 * Sieve: For an ultra-fine powder, you can sift it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any larger bits. These can be re-ground or just tossed into your next soup.

 * Storing Your Mushroom Powder: Store your beautiful homemade mushroom powder in a small, airtight jar, again in a cool, dark, dry place. It's even more susceptible to moisture than whole dried mushrooms, so a good seal is vital. It will last for months, retaining amazing flavour.
Part 6: How to Use Your Wild Mushroom Powder (WFPB Style!). 
Now for the fun part ‚Äì how do we use this incredible WFPB flavour enhancer? The possibilities are endless!

 * Soups & Stews: Whisk it into broths for an instant depth of flavour. Amazing in lentil soup, bean chilli, or vegetable stews.
 * Sauces & Gravies: Adds a rich, savoury, umami kick to your plant-based sauces and gravies. Perfect for mushroom gravy without needing fresh mushrooms!
 * Seasoning Blends: Mix it with other herbs and spices to create your own unique seasoning blends for tofu, tempeh, roasted vegetables, or potatoes.
 * ""No-Cheese"" Sprinkles: Combine with nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt for a savoury sprinkle over pasta, popcorn, or salads.
 * Burgers & Loaves: Add a tablespoon or two to your homemade veggie burger patties or lentil loaves for an extra layer of deliciousness.
 * Dips & Spreads: Mix into hummus, cashew cream, or bean dips.
 * Bread & Savoury Bakes: You can even incorporate a little into savoury bread doughs or muffin recipes!

Seriously, this wild mushroom powder is a game-changer for adding complex, savoury notes to your WFPB cooking without any oil, salt, or processed ingredients if you choose. It‚Äôs pure, concentrated mushroom goodness!",2,1748679497.0,airfryer,1,1.0,False
