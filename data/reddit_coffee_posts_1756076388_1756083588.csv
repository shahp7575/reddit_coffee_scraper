So a few weeks ago I ran a half marathon in fairly high temperatures (90 degrees) 

I kind had to drag myself to finish it, but ever since then I just haven’t felt like myself. I don’t know if it was heat exhaustion. 

At first I chalked it up to normal recovery, but the symptoms have been weird.

Here’s how it’s been going:
	
	•	Whenever I move around, I sometimes feel woozy or floaty, like my body’s a little off balance.
	•	There are random times I get really cold or even shivery, even on days I haven’t trained.
	•	One time I had a medium cold coffee and it made me feel super off, dizzy and cold.
	•	Eating sugar seems to make the wooziness go away temporarily, but then it comes back. When I eat something with protein + complex carbs, I feel more stable.
	•	No chest pain or fainting. Just occasional mild shortness of breath (which could also be anxiety tbh).

Prior to the half marathon, I’ve been running consistently but I may have increased my pace too quickly week on week and also been lifting at the gym beginning 

Now I’m wondering: could this be reactive hypoglycemia or just my body still stressed from the half marathon? Has anyone else gone through something like this after endurance events  and or heat exhaustion?

P.s haven’t seen a doc yet cause I don’t have insurance :/",1,1756083493.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False
1mzcvpt,https://i.redd.it/04wz805nd2lf1.jpeg,Why the Old You Always Comes Back (Sunday Coffee Talk Reflection),"We’ve all experienced it. You make progress, feel momentum building, and then out of nowhere the *old you* sneaks back in. The habits you thought you left behind, the doubts you believed you overcame — they return.

Here’s the truth: your old identity doesn’t disappear. It doesn’t die. It simply goes dormant. And when stress or uncertainty strikes, your subconscious pulls it back up like an old file. Why? Because the subconscious doesn’t care about growth. It cares about safety. And safety is usually the familiar — even if the familiar keeps you stuck.

In my latest **Sunday Coffee Talk**, I unpacked this pattern and realized something powerful: you don’t fight the old you. Fighting it only keeps it alive. Instead, you **outgrow it.** You raise your standards so high that the old self has nowhere left to live.

This shift changes everything about personal growth, manifestation, and success.

What’s your experience? Have you felt the “old you” creep back in — and how did you handle it?",1,1756083469.0,u_ChadNapierOfficial,0,1.0,False

1mzcqoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mzcqoa/st_ovadis_home_for_wayward_children_pt_10/,St. Ovadis Home For Wayward Children Pt. 10,"“Got any water?” I weakly croaked at Douggie. 

“Come on, let’s move, we gotta go,” Douggie said. 

“How long was I out for?” I asked, 

“5 days,” He responded. I looked down at my wrists, seeing a scar that went up through my hand and forearm. We walked back out into the field, staying low and crawling through the field. We made it to the center of the field. With the slab of rock in the center. We heard voices coming from behind us in the distance. We heard the sound of rustling plants and cracking sticks coming closer. We dropped to our stomachs and shuffled to the side. We then heard the footsteps getting closer and faster. A huge, thick hand wrapped around my ankle, pulling me out from the stocks of corn. Lifting me and dropping me and Douggie on the dirt. “You thought that you could get out of here without me knowing I have eyes everywhere, Marcus, my dear boy,” The Headmaster said. Douggie ran to his feet and punched him in the mouth. A little trickle of blood slipped out of the corner of his mouth. 

“**YOU DARE STRIKE A GOD YOU FEEBLE INSOLENT CHILD,**” The Headmaster yelled. He pulled his foot back and kicked in the ribs so hard that I heard them crack. He then lifted him and headbutted him back to the ground. Douggie started to try to crawl away toward the door. The Headmaster strolled along with him before stamping down onto his leg, stopping and leaving him writhing in pain. He then lifted his right arm and placed his foot on the back of his elbow. Kicking hard, snapping his arm so hard I almost bit off a piece of my tongue when I gritted my teeth. His screams sounded through the warehouse-sized underground farm. He dragged Douggie’s body over to the stone circle. Douggie tried to tear his hand off his scalp with his one good arm. He punched him in the stomach so hard that more blood spluttered up from his mouth. He lay there on the ground, still without moving. He raised his foot high above his face, and before I could get to him, he slammed his foot down on his face three times. “**SMACK**” “**CRACK**” “**SQUELCH**”. All I could muster out was a strained, broken cry of 

“NO”. I sobbed loudly and ran to Douggie’s side. 

“Please, God, don’t die, my god, please don’t die”. 

“Look, Marcus stars”. I looked up at the ceiling to see the small circular skylight with stars shimmering down from it. I watched as Douggie let out one last tear before closing his eyes and passing on. He finally became a spaceman. I ran at the Headmaster. He spun around quickly and punched me in the stomach so hard that when I landed, I saw stars. Just like that, he was dead. Douggie was dead. My best friend's body lay still and motionless, with all the warmth from his body spilling out onto the dirt. I fell back onto my back, staring up at the lamps illuminating this warehouse-like space. I wasn’t brought back by the sound of the Headmaster shouting. I knew that any moment now I would wake up and see my mom standing over my bed telling me that the past decade was just one long dream and I would hear Rick snoring in the other room and the old A/C rattling in the hot summer night and that my mom would sing me a son from our favorite band and I would fall back to sleep knowing that in a couple of hours that I would wake up and see my mom downstairs in her polka-dot apron making fresh blueberry pancakes and that she would smile at me and I would do the same back to her. She would then let me try a sip of our coffee, even though we both knew that I hated the taste of it. She would then wave goodbye to me as I rode the bus to school. And the world would be at peace again. But I knew it wasn’t true. No blueberry pancakes were waiting for me, and this was no dream. I heard the Headmaster shout at the orderlies. 

“Go take the dead one to the press and the other one to the boiler room, and go clean this crap up and get me some new clothes”. I felt myself hoisted over one of the orderlies’ shoulders. I didn’t fight, I just let him carry me off. I didn’t care what happened anymore. I died with Douggie that night. I was set in a metal closet of a room with small, thin pipes and copper and brass walls. The floor was covered with a thick film that looked like some kind of ash or soot. I sat in there for about five minutes before the room began to heat up. It hurt to touch the walls as they singed my fingers and clothes. I began to sweat profusely, and my vision began to blur from the heat. I vomited into the pile of ash from the heat. I was feeling dizzy. Just then, my pants began to get singed at the bottom of my pant legs. I heard the gas start to turn on like the sound a blowtorch makes before it starts blasting flames. I can’t remember if I passed out at this point or not, but I was standing in a green field with a blue sky and a crystal lake in front of it. It looks like a mirror copy of where I had met with Belial. I started to sob uncontrollably when I saw the figures standing before me. It was Elizabeth and Douggie. They stood before me with caring and empathetic eyes. 

“Wh-wh-where am I?”. 

“The Elysian Fields”. 

“Is this heaven?”. 

“Yes, Marcus, this is heaven”. 

“Am I dead?”. 

“No, not yet, but we are here to give you some words of encouragement so that you may finish what you have yet to complete”. 

“No, wait, I can’t go back there, he’s too powerful, he won.” 

“Not yet, Marcus, you have to win, you have to make sure we don't die in vain”. 

“One last thing, Marcus, I always said that you were my sidekick. I was always the sidekick, Marcus. You are the Batman to my Robin. 

“I can’t, Douggie, I’m nothing without you”.  

“You're Yourself, Marcus”. I looked up and saw a white cloud with golden light shooting out from it. Only for a moment did the cloud part, and I saw a face made of every color and sound and emotion. It was indescribable, it was magnificent, it was glorious. I saw him, I saw the face of God. I was launched down through the ground back into the boiler room.  I then touched my jacket pocket and felt the note that Douggie had given me. I knew I couldn’t let that burn; I had to give it to his parents. I had to tell them I was sorry that I couldn’t keep their son safe. I punched the glass. It was firm, but I had to keep going. I kept slamming my fist into the glass over and over again. My hand was bleeding and battered. I could feel my hand breaking as I kept hitting it until I started to see cracks. Then “**CRACK CRACK SHATTER**”. The glass loudly shattered, leaving a hole that I could reach my arm through. Just barely brushing down on the handle.  I grabbed the handle on the latch and pulled it upwards. I burst through the door, slamming the latch back down after me. One of the staff members ran forward and lunged at me. I was able to roll out of the way. Just as he lunged at me, the room that I was in erupted in flames, blasting him in the face and spiraling backwards. Some of the sparks flickered onto a beam of food resting nearby. Clutching one side of his face, as it was seared from the fire. I then grabbed him and pushed him forward into an open plexiglass door.Before he could react, I shut and latched the door as he banged on the door from the other side. I then turned to the side and slammed my fist down on a button on a control console next to the door. The man looked up, all blood draining from his face as a huge metal cylinder descended above him. It had pieces of guts and intestines dripping off of it as it lowered. As I turned and ran away, I heard him pleading and begging before another huge “**SQUELCH**”. I looked over and saw a huge chute with a couple of shovels next to it. Wherever that chute led was better than here. I dropped down into the chute, and it sloped and turned several times. It felt like the chute was caked in a layer of mud, which covered me. When I got to the bottom, there was a small amount of light trickling in from a crack in the ceiling. It barely illuminated 3 feet in front of me. I saw bones and pieces of rotting flesh. The scent of it made me vomit onto the ground, then stumble into my vomit. I then looked at myself and realized that the mud from the chute was rotting flesh. I had no time to dwell on it. I had to get through this. I placed my hand on the left wall and walked forward. As I had heard, if you put your hand on the left wall of a maze and follow it, you can get out in the fastest way possible. The Headmaster tackled me into the side of the wall. He was on top of me. I could feel him squeezing the life from my body. I picked up a heavy nearby rock and bashed it into his face. He tumbled off me and fell to the ground. He was bleeding from the side of his face and was fuming with anger. I kicked him in the side, and on the second kick, he caught my foot and pulled me to the floor. He grabbed my head and slammed it into the wooden support beams. I spun around and sucker punched him in the jaw. He pulled out a knife and jabbed it into my side. I could feel my liver burn as the steel was plunged into it. He twisted the knife like a screwdriver and pulled the knife out from my side. Blood gushed from the wound as I tried to stop the bleeding. I kicked him in the stomach, which felt like fire on my side. He fell to the ground, and I jumped up on top of him and grabbed another rock and raised it high above my head and brought it down over and over again so many times that I thought that the rock might split. I looked down at the man who had haunted my nightmares for the past twelve years. His head is now a caved-in disk. I stood up, spat some blood from my mouth onto him, and continued to walk. I could hear roaring fire all around me, but I just kept on moving. I could barely walk and needed some water and a shower. I didn’t know how long I was down there. I didn't know if I was down there for 6 hours or 6 days. All I know is that I eventually came to a stairway. I walked up the stairs and found a door. I slammed myself into the door, and it opened up into the front garden, the same front garden I had spent so many years sitting out with Douggie in this grass. I walked out to the front area, the little cobblestone walkway leading up to the front doors. I stood in the same spot where Ms.Kathy had jumped off the roof. The front gates in front of me were wide open. I walked forward, standing in front of the gates. Wondering if I would get shot or something, or erupt in flames, but instead, I just passed through the gates. Freel,y nothing happened, and when I crossed the street, I looked back at the St. Ovadis home for wayward children. I saw him there, standing in the window, smoking a cigar was the Headmaster.The school all around him was a blazing inferno. I could hear the screams of the orderlies as they got their final judgments. I knew I wouldn’t be able to save the others in there, but I prayed they could find their way out. He just watched me with his blank demonic face illuminated by the cigar. He just turned and walked back into the red and burning death. I just looked back at the school that had been my prison for the last decade. I cried knowing that I was finally free. I thought back to all those days ago to what Douggie had said. “ The closest town is only 5 miles away”. I started walking in the direction of the town I could see on the map with the list of home locations. I got pretty far before seeing a small patch of trees next to a small stream, which I realized I hadn’t eaten or drunk anything in a week. I knelt and drank furiously and then saw a patch of berries next to the stream. I couldn't believe it. They were raspberries. I turned my head to the night sky and yelled, 

“Thank God”.  I grabbed fistfuls of them and swallowed them in one bite. I looked down at my face and realized I looked awful. I had bruises all over my face and arms, my hair was matted and greasy, and I also had a slight five o’clock shadow. I had never realized, up until this point, really just how much I did look like my mother. I  waded into the river and washed the rotting flesh off my body, then left my clothes on the riverbank. I then sat with my back resting on a tree nearby and slept there for the rest of the night. The next morning, I continued to walk down the road. Seeing a sign saying “Town Line Entering Zion, Maryland”. I saw a small family home on one side of the road and realized even after my river bath, I still smelled horrible and probably looked even worse, and what's the worst that could happen, prison? I walked around the side of the house and realized I hadn’t been in a real home in ten years. I jumped and climbed over the wooden fence and realized I was getting good at climbing and running. I kicked open the weak sliding screen door and stepped inside. I saw a calendar and realized the year was 1993. I tore open the fridge and riffled through it searching for some form of food, and settled on leftover chicken. It was the best meal I've had in my life. I then moved on to the bedrooms, searching the bedrooms for some clothes that would fit me. I then ended up choosing an old leather jacket, a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and work boots. I grabbed some snacks and a bottle of water and walked out the front door. I kept walking past the town and then came to a small clearing in a forest overlooking a small lake. I picked up a sharp rock, took two flat pieces of wood, and fashioned a couple of makeshift graves. One for Douggie and one for Elizabeth. I then realized that I still hadn’t read his note out of respect for him. I wondered if he read mine. 

Dear mom, dad, and andy

    Mom, I always loved you, and you always loved me. I know we never show it to each other, but I know you always had my best interests at heart. But I want you to promise me something, promise me you’ll go clean and that you’ll stop using your pills. 

Dad, I know you weren’t really in my life that much, but I know you would have made a great dad. Promise me that you’ll be a good dad to Andy. 

Andy, stay away from my comic books, or I'll come back and haunt you. But you always were a good step-brother, and as much as I pretended to hate you, I always loved you. 

With love 

Dylan “Douggie” Parker Jr.

I felt tears fall onto the page. I blinked and bit my lower lip to stop myself from sobbing and put the note back into my pocket. I then looked out at the view, and it was beautiful. The sky was clear blue, and not a cloud in sight. Douggie always did like blue skies. I wish he were here with me. He was a good friend, the best one I ever had. I wish I had the chance to tell him that. He was the best thing that ever happened to me.",1,1756083064.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1mzcpj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mzcpj3/should_i_go_no_contact_with_my_sister/,Should I go no contact with my sister?,"Hi I would greatly appreciate advice on some family drama going on right now. (TW: sexual assault of a minor)

Some context for the situation I (24F) got married to my partner (enby 26) at the beginning of the year. My oldest sister, lets call Aliyah (32F), told me she would not be attending, because she believed that marriage was between a man and a woman. I knew that Aliyah was religious and we do not discuss politics with her because her and her husband are very conservative (think anti-vax). However, since my partner and I got together almost 3 years before hand I thought she had come around to the idea of us being together. I was in for a shock when she let me know that she was not going to be supportive of one of her sisters and come to our wedding ceremony. I let her know that I did not support her and her husband being together and I still attended her wedding. Regardless of your religious or political beliefs I would have thought that you show up for family. 

This is all pre context for the situation we found out about a couple months later. My Younger sister, Peyton (22F) got coffee with Aliyah to discuss the wedding and me being hurt about it. While they were catching up Aliyah had mentioned something about her husband being in Jail when he was 15. He is 38 now (catch the age gap between him and Aliyah?) We had previously known that when he was a teenager he had been arrested or charged with a couple things, but I thought they were smaller things like theft or something along those lines. Well we find out that it was actually for Molestation. Finding this information out was unfortunately not shocking, but still threw us for a loop. We were around him as kids. My sister Aliyah met him when she was 16 and he was 22. My younger sister and I being 7 and 9. Obviously, we felt extremely uncomfortable that our parents never sat down with us to let us know in an age appropriate way to be weary of him, or even years later telling us the truth. By middle school I would 100% known what a predator was. 

Aliyah 100% believes he did not do this crime and that he apparently took the plea deal to get less time. He only actually served a year in Jail and was on the sex offender list for around 10 years after, because he was a minor when the crime happened. I don’t believe he followed proper protocol for this (he was around kids a lot at our neighborhood pool during those 10 years of being on the sex offender list.) We are very aware that her views on this might be skewed, because she was literally being groomed by this man at the age of 16. She found this out not long after they got together. After finding out about this, my sisters all had conversations with my parents, where they apologized for not ever talking to us about this. (They have a tendency to avoid most conflict and don’t talk about a lot of things) They were not able to give us a straight answer on what they believed happened or not. All of my siblings excluding Aliyah have decided that we believe that he probably did what he was charged for. I was already low contact with Aliyah for her views and her decision not to come to my wedding and I think I want to go no contact.

I have had multiple conversations with Aliyah and my parents that my partner and I will most likely not go to family events that Aliyah and her husband will also be at. Aliyah didn’t take this well, because she thought that he was going to be uninvited to family events. I know that my parents would never intentionally uninvite him and I wouldn’t ask them to do that. I know Aliyah is also their daughter so I can’t expect them to feel the same way my sisters and I do about the situation. 

What completely sucks is that Aliyah and her husband have 3 kids together and I adore my niece and nephews. I know going no contact completely would also mean no contact with the kids and I hate that. It’s not their fault that their dad is the way that he is. (He also has said multiple racist and ableist things, while having a son who is on the spectrum. And is super misogynistic while talking down to us whenever we disagree with something he says.) So my question is: Is there a way to go about this- family functions or other things so we can still see the kids and not their parents? I feel extremely lost here and I thought some outside opinions would really help! Has anyone been in a situation like this where they went no contact with someone who indirectly affected your contact with someone else?

Also I know many people will recommend therapy. I am in therapy currently and have talked about the situation. Not sure if family therapy could be an option or if that would even go well?

1mzcp1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProteusLeadership/comments/1mzcp1p/does_it_really_matter_what_people_think_and_say/,Does It Really Matter What People Think and Say About You?,"Let me ask you this:  
Have you ever had an idea, a goal, or a vision you were excited about – only to have someone shoot it down with a comment, a look, or even silence, or even worse – indifference?

Have you ever been *misunderstood*, *misrepresented*, or *messed around* by someone who didn’t really know your heart – but thought they knew your story?

Let me tell you, if you’re *doing anything of value* in this life – if you’re showing up authentically, building something meaningful, or leading people toward change – then criticism is not just likely – It’s inevitable.

You **will** be talked about.  
You **will** be questioned.  
And you **will** be judged – often unfairly, sometimes harshly, and most times by people who don’t have the full story.

But here’s the leadership truth: **It’s not what they say that defines you – it’s how you respond that sets the course for your future.**

And responding starts with clarity: **Clarity about who you are, what you stand for, and what your purpose is.**

Because when you’re clear, the noise of others fades into the background.

So, Does It Really Matter What People Think and Say About You?

The short answer is – YES, but the long answer is – *Only sometimes and it depends on who they are and what their motives might be.*

Let me explain.

People’s thoughts and words about you *can* matter when they come from a place of care, wisdom, or mentorship. Feedback from people who *know you*, who want the best for you, who are walking the journey with you – **that kind of feedback is gold**. It’s something we *should* always welcome and pay attention to.

But here’s the flip side…

If we allow **everyone’s** opinions to hold weight – especially those who aren’t walking in our shoes, and don’t share our values, or those who are simply trying to tear down what they don’t understand – then we hand over the reins of our life to the crowd.

And let me tell you, true leadership doesn’t work like that.

You can’t let *every voice* in the crowd become your compass.

Warren Buffett put it perfectly when he said:

>

That quote is all about *life* wisdom – It’s emotional intelligence 101.

It’s about taking back the controls.

True leadership is responding with thought, not reacting with emotion.

I love that line in Warren Buffet’s quote where he says: ***“If words control you, that means everyone else can control you.”***

If you’re constantly triggered by what others say or don’t say… then you’re handing them the steering wheel of your life.

I don’t know about you – but I want to be the *driver of my own life*, not the passenger.

**So, How Do We Combat Negative Comments and Feedback?**

Let’s talk strategy here…

The moment you step out, the moment you *dare to be different* or put yourself out there – you WILL get feedback. ***It is a gift that keeps on giving!***

Some of it will be well-meaning. Some of it will sting. Some of it will be flat-out wrong.

So, how do we deal with it without letting it derail us?

I want to introduce you to what is called the **“Triple R” Method.**

The first **R** in the method is:

# 1. RECOGNISE the Source

Not all feedback is created equal.

When you hear a negative comment or feel the sting of criticism, pause and ask:

* Who is this coming from?
* What’s their relationship to me?
* Do they know the full story – or just a small part of it?
* Are they speaking from experience… or from their own insecurity?
* What is their intent?

Because we’ve all received feedback from someone who wasn’t really *in the arena*.

They weren’t in the trenches with us. They weren’t building or growing or leading anything themselves – but they had *plenty* to say. So, why would I take notice of them when their comments are not to build the situation up but to create doubt.

So, recognise the *voice and where it is coming from* and ask yourself – **is this someone worth listening to?**

Because taking criticism from someone you wouldn’t trade places with is a fast track to self-doubt and confusion.

In fact, there are some people you don’t want to agree with you. Because when they don’t – you know you are on the right track.

The second R in the method is:

# 2. REFLECT Before You React

Reflecting identifies one of the most underrated leadership superpowers:  
**The pause.**

In our fast-paced world, reacting is easy. You hear something that offends you, and boom – you want to snap back, explain yourself, go into defence mode, which usually makes things worse.

**But what if we paused?**  
What if we gave ourselves the space to *respond* instead of *reacting*?

That’s restraint. That’s maturity. That’s power.

And so, we need to take time to ask:

* Is there a grain of truth in this?
* Could I grow from this feedback?
* Or, is this just noise that I need to discard?

Responding doesn’t mean being passive. It means choosing a response that aligns with your values, your purpose, your intent and your bigger picture.

The third R is:

# 3. REFOCUS on What Matters

After you’ve filtered the feedback—*refocus*.

Because **what you focus on, you** ***magnify***. If you spend your energy stewing over what someone said or how unfair it was, you’re giving away *precious real estate* in your mind to something that doesn’t serve you.

So, instead shift your focus back to your:

* Purpose
* Vision
* Values
* The Impact you want to make

In other words – Go back to your “why.”

**Because the loudest voice in your life shouldn’t be the most critical one – it should be the one that calls you forward.**

**So, How Can We Better Focus on the GOOD in Situations in our lives?**

Let’s be honest, it can be tough to do this.

We’re bombarded daily with bad news, unrealistic expectations, and emotional curveballs. And if we’re not careful, we can start to see the bad in ***every*** situation before we even consider the good.

But here’s what I’ve learned from making mistakes right through my life:

**Focusing on the good is not a personality trait. It’s a practice. Something we must train ourselves to do over a period of time.**

Let me say that again:

**Positivity is a practice – not a personality.**

You ***can*** train your brain to look for good – not bad.  
You ***can*** learn to reframe situations and not get caught in the mud.  
You ***can*** build the habit of *hope –* not constant despair.

Here’s how:

**Firstly – Start a Daily Gratitude Ritual –** (Hugh Van Cuylenberg speaks a lot about this in his wonderful book – ’The Resilience Project’) where he reminds us that we must constantly focus on what we are grateful for).

Just recently I had the privilege of having a breakfast with all of my family (my children and partners and grandchildren) – As I looked around the table, I was full of gratitude and pride and couldn’t stop thinking about how grateful I was to have such special people around me and how I needed to do more to foster the relationships.

Every morning – or every evening – write down three things you are grateful for.  
They don’t have to be profound.

It could be the hot coffee in your hand. The email of encouragement you got yesterday. The fact that your kids are healthy. That you made it through a tough meeting without losing your cool. The key is to focus on the good not the bad.

**Gratitude rewires your brain to see possibility instead of problems and to be thankful for who you are and what you have.**

And the more you practice it, the more naturally it flows.

**Secondly – Choose Your Narrative**

We don’t always get to choose our *circumstances*, but we *do* get to choose the *story* we tell about them.

Ask yourself:

* Am I the victim in this story, or the hero?
* Is this a dead end – or a detour?
* Is this failure – or a stepping stone?

What you call something matters.  
So name it with hope. Frame it with positivity.

**Thirdly – Spend Time with Hope-Filled People**

Negativity is contagious – but so is *hope*!

Surround yourself with people who speak HOPE into your life.  
People who remind you of your worth and that you are enough.  
People who *see* you – not just your mistakes.  
People who challenge you to grow – not stay stuck and stagnant.

Because who you surround yourself with will determine what you believe is possible – so choose wisely!

You know, a simple concept that I have discovered through all the highs and lows of leadership is that:

**We are the authors of our own lives – so it is up to us the type of story we write and live.**

But too many of us have let other people ghostwrite our stories.

We’ve let their opinions become chapters of our life. We’ve let fear write the plot and stop us from achieving. We’ve let silence fill the pages that were meant for greatness.

It’s time to take back the pen and write some new chapters.

Because you are not here to blend in.  
You are here to **lead.**

To **grow.**  
To **shine.**  
To **stand tall.**  
To **Influence.**

So, don’t let criticism dim your light. Let it *clarify* your direction.

* Life doesn’t just happen – we make it happen
* Action precedes clarity
* And we don’t know what we don’t know – until we go find out!

What people think and say about us does not define who we are  –  only you can do that!

B*reathe*, *observe*, *respond*, and keep moving toward the life and leadership you were born for.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711).

1mzcnvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1mzcnvu/coffee_and_muscletendon_pain/,Coffee and muscle/tendon pain,"One of the changes I made before my relapse last year was switching coffee brands. I wasn’t suspicious of that change because I wasn’t aware coffee was a trigger until a few months ago. I still don’t think it’s a cause just possible contribution. But something I’ve noticed since is certain coffee *brands* or types seem to correlate with an uptick in muscle/tendon pain. (I’m not sure which to designate it as, it just feels like the biggest buildup of lactic acid ever occurring from my knees to my toes. My worst flox issues are tendon and nerve related starting in my feet.) It improves a couple days after I switch brands, and it normally isn’t an issue unless I drink trigger coffees back to back or several times in a week. I’ve experimented with this a lot since April, I know this particular flare is coffee but curious as to why I can I have one brand/flavor with seemingly zero issues.  

Between original flox and relapse I had no problem with coffee. Im cutting out triggers and considering quitting coffee altogether to see if there’s any other improvements. I don’t drink sodas, never did, and stopped herbal teas last fall after seeing the possible triggers for that as well.

I’ve searched a little through the posts and comments for coffee triggering flares, but I didn’t quite see this reaction and I was wondering if anyone has any input. I know this isn’t an essential food item, I’m just hoping to better understand dietary triggers for myself. ",1,1756082849.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

1mzcl5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mzcl5i/confused_help_is_he_attracted_to_me/,"Confused, help - Is he attracted to me?","There’s a guy who works at a local cafe, and I am almost certain he likes me - as I like him - but I have zero hard confirmation, and I am thoroughly confused.

- Background: Started going to this cafe around a year ago. We made small talk. I came back, and he talked with my friend and I for hours until closing. I made it a regular place, and he quickly established a habit of seating me by the counter, and talking to me for hours while he worked at his shift.

- I didn’t flirt explicitly, neither did he, but he talked constantly about things we both found interesting; politics, geeky stuff, personal histories, etc. 

- I would go to that cafe to read, and one time someone noted I wasn’t getting more than three pages through a book after hours, because every time I started to read, he would talk again. 

- I would hold eye contact and smile at him, and whenever he’d see, he’d look happy and perk up. A couple of weeks ago, I smiled at him and he smiled back, looking over his shoulder as he walked into the kitchen… and crashed into a person leaving it. 

- I often have coffee there with friends, and he always finds an opening in the discussion to talk with the two of us. 

- I mentioned to a guy friend I had coffee with last week that I liked the guy, and he leaned in excitedly to tell me, ‘He likes you, as well! He’s been hitting on you the entire time we’ve been here!’ Evidently, he’s seeing what I am not. Or he’s blind and reading it inaccurately. 

- Several friends who have had coffee with me there have expressed the same thing, noting sparks and shared attraction, even if either of us is actually not saying anything. 


- The issue: I told him half a year ago that if he was less busy, it would have been great to buy him a coffee. He laughed, but the next time I came to the cafe, he ran to the kitchen and stayed there, hiding, the entire time. So, evidently, expressing interest backfired. 

- He was back to being very talkative and happy the next time after that, but I didn’t ask him for coffee again.

- Recently, we both left the cafe as it was closing, and exchanged numbers after I asked if he wanted to be friends. I arranged to give him some books, as I’m downsizing to move apartments, and sent him a text, which he didn’t read after several days. Guessing that’s a sign of someone not fussed about contact, texting, etc. which is fair, not a problem. Just think this indicates he’s disinterested. 

- Some days, he is really happy to see me, and is incredibly talkative. Other days, he looks incredibly anxious and uncomfortable to see me, and makes short, polite remarks with an icy tone, as opposed to his usual excited, warm, engaging attitude. 

Idk what to read from it, I like this guy, but the uncertainty and the back and forth is doing my head in. Any advice/estimates as to what’s going on with the situation? ",1,1756082644.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Black coffee and a cigarette.

I've cut out the milk, I've cut out the sugar.

But I haven't seemed to get any further.

I've liked English tea with a biscuit,

But it's not that same satisfaction that I'd get
,
From black coffee and a cigarette!

Tea without sugar and milk is too bitter,

And the biscuit doesn't fill this unhealthy hunger.

I smoke much more than I drink I know I have to quit!

But what can take the place of this calming habit?
Black coffee and a cigarette...

1mzchdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/confess/comments/1mzchdk/i_slept_with_a_possible_russian_supremacist_as_a/,I slept with a possible Russian supremacist as a Ukrainian (I regret it so much),"TW: nsfw (sex, and kinks)

So I (17f) am mixed (Ukrainian, and Indian), and lower middle class, living in London. I try to make myself feel connected with my cultures with how I dress, and what i do. I speak out on a lot of issues such as the Ukraine war, Palestine, womens rights, racism, the fetishisation of races and ethnicities (from my experience being Ukrainian and indian),and go to protests a lot. 

A couple weeks ago I met a guy online (18m) who was mixed (English, and Russian) and upper middle class, and we got along really well, we both had similar political views, we liked the same bands, the same shows so it was nice. And from I asked and he answered he didn’t fetishise south Asians so I was relieved and because he was Eastern European himself I didn’t think he would fetishise Slavic people. We lived close so we decided to meet up.

We met up, he was very sweet at first he payed for my coffee and food and sounded interested in what I was saying but then things took a turn quickly. He’d bombard me with philosophical questions, I am not a really big philosophy person so I did struggle to give my opinion and answers which he was kind of annoyed at I think. He also said that he was doing an apprenticeship at a government department because of connections with his family, and to lighten the mood I talked about my work experience at a small local art club and how I’m applying to work in Sainsbury’s, he responds by saying that he never realised how much nepotism is used in the uk so idk what this guys deal is but I power through the date. He then said some stuff about being a sociopath, that wanting the 30% of Ukraine that Russia took over is unrealistic (Ik it’s unrealistic but you don’t say that to a person explaining that their family are getting bombed yk),asked if I wanted to be a housewife and then follow up with saying he forgot most households can’t afford to live off of one income and other just really out of touch stuff, but I give him the benifit of the doubt and power through.

One thing led to another and we ended up going to his place and I stupidly agreed to having sex. As we were talking our clothes off he specifically asked for me to not take my Indian bangles off because he likes them which did start to set off alarms of South Asian fetishisation. Everything was going fine until he pulled out a fake knife and scraped it across my thigh (coincidentally right along my very obvious sh scars so idk what to make of that). I didn’t know it was fake until I felt it on me. After I told him I wasn’t into that it became fine again until he started talking dirty, at first it was normal degrading which I didn’t really have a problem with but then it became a bit too specific. These are some of the quotes that have been stuck in my head because I really can’t believe he actually said these:
“You’re my little Ukrainian slut”
“You like begging for Russian dicks”
“I bet your Ukrainian family would be so ashamed if they could see you”
“We’re superior to you”
“That Ukrainian men don’t deserve to have their way with you because you’re too pretty”
“Russia will always win against you, you should just give up”


I was absolutely mortified. I was in shock. It came out of nowhere it just came right out. Because I was in shock and in denial thinking “I must be making this up because there’s no way this is happening” I didn’t say anything or tell him to stop. 

He also asked me to call myself the first thing he said and because I didn’t know what to do and if this guy had a fake knife he’d have a real knife somewhere and bc I didn’t want to piss him off bc he’s fucking crazy, I did that. As I did I could feel him climax from me saying it.

After he did what he wanted I left to go home, he walked me to the train station and said he didn’t actually mean what he said but to not tell anyone this because it could harm his future career in politics.

It’s been two days and I am still mortified with how I didn’t stop him as soon as he started saying stuff. I know he said he didn’t mean it but you have to have some rooted xenophobia and racism for you to say that unprompted let alone get off from it. I feel like I owe every Ukrainian person an apology for what i stupidly got myself into and I regret even meeting this man ever.",1,1756082353.0,confess,0,1.0,False
1mzcgey,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mzcgey/citric_acid_and_adderall/,Citric Acid and Adderall,"So it’s pretty well known that your not suppose to have Adderall and Citric Acid together. The science after a quick google is dumbed down for me to understand as follows. 

Copy and paste from google*

Reduced absorption:
Citric acid can decrease the absorption of Adderall from the gastrointestinal tract, making it less effective. 

Increased metabolism:
Citric acid can increase the metabolism of Adderall, reducing its duration of action. 

Altered urinary pH:
Citric acid makes the urine more acidic, which can increase the excretion of Adderall through the kidneys. 

So now the twist and where I need advice. GLP1 and tums. GLP1s delay the stomach from emptying. Tums are calcium carbonate which is super basic which lower the acidity of the stomach. 

So my question is how would GLP1s, Tums, Adderall and citric acid all work together in the stomach at once? I understand dose of each probably has more than anything to do with what happens. 

I have been on Adderall for about a year and yet to see any effect at all from the Adderall despite  being raised to 40mg a day. My end goal is the most out of the Adderall but I am on a GLP1 for weight loss. I have the occasional acid reflux, not frequently enough for Zantac or Pantoprazole just the occasional Tums. I use energy drinks for my multiple job/kids/life. Yes I know you are not suppose to be on caffeine which on Adderall but I only get so many hours of sleep a night. I don’t have a ton of caffeine via energy drinks but enough my concern is the citric acid neutralizes the Adderall. I hate the taste the coffee and tea and enjoy energy drinks. 99% of energy drinks in my town have citric acid and don’t have unlimited money for online energy drink shopping.

So help me? Advice? Obvious answer is stop everything but Adderall but no impulse control in the moment. How does Adderall, GLP1s, Tums, citric acid interact together? Who wins? How do I make the Adderall win?",1,1756082279.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1mzcg2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1mzcg2d/wave_of_home_based_cafes_opinions/,Wave of home based cafes opinions?,"Anyone else notice the wave of home-based “cafés” popping up lately? Everywhere on IG it’s matcha lattes, cold brews, or specialty coffee being brewed out of someone’s HDB/landed kitchen.

What surprised me is that some of them are charging café-level prices (I’ve seen one selling $8 for an iced latte… but to be fair most sell at $5-6), sometimes even more if it’s “specialty grade” matcha. That’s pretty much what you’d pay at a proper cafe, except here it’s someone’s house.

On one hand, it’s cool that people are hustling and trying to create their own brands - refreshing to see entrepreneurship in youth these days. On the other, I wonder if it’s sustainable or fair, since actual cafes have to pay rent, staff, licences and inspections.

Curious what you all think: Would you actually pay $8–9 for a drink from a home-based setup? Is this the new “home bakery” craze, or a longer-term trend?",1,1756082251.0,SingaporeRaw,7,0.57,False

I'm sure this gets asked alot  
  
I mainly game during the day while doing my daily things, but I had a rash of several girls who told me they recently broke up with their boyfriend. But I wasn't able to close them.  
  
One said - ""I'm in a real weird headspace and kinda hate men right now...""  
Other said - ""Just got out of a 5 year relationship, and I'm really not looking for anything.""  
And the third got defensive and said something like - ""I told you I'm not interested in dating right now!"" when I offered that we should get coffee and learn more about eachother cuz I found her kinda interesting and cute...  
  
HOWEVER, like this old black guy who would smoke his cigars outside the coffee shop my Father and his crew use to hang out at...  
He'd say something like ""She might be single, but she still be Fuckin!""  
  
And YEAH, like he said these girls above who quote ""hate men right now,"" and are ""not really looking for anything right now..."" Well - ""They still be Fuckin!""  
  
YET how do you respond to these girls when do throw out these statements above or ones like it.  
AND, what about the rebound guy???  
She's got a rebound guy - why couldn't it be me when I meet them casually during the day.

Which one is it?,"I've recently discovered PMDD and that it's linked to ADHD, which makes SO much sense. But now I'm not sure which one I should treat. I am on the wait list for an ADHD assessment (brother was recently dx). 

I used to be on high dose SSRI's years ago and that made me feel like an absolute zombie, but I'm considering taking them again if it means I won't completely ruin my life around my period. 

But then I am wondering if waiting for my ADHD assessment and possibly taking the stimulants would be more beneficial. But on the other hand, I can barely even drink more than 1x cup of coffee a day without feeling riddled by anxiety.

Ontop of this, I also have an anxious attachment style that I am normally ontop of every other part of the month. But during premenstrual phase it absolutely ramps up, I can't focus on anything and I am extremely sensitive/overthinking every aspect of my life.

This is literally ruining my interpersonal relationships and my everyday functioning. I nearly broke up with my partner because we had a fight and it gave me a dopamine hit to say that I couldn't do it anymore. I really feel so overwhelmed and completely out of control. I can't figure out if this is PMDD or ADHD flare up. Any advice?

then 3rd day, they ask me to compress a Jpeg about Job hiring nakita ko yung pinasang Jpeg nila via Email anliit ng sulat so I decided to suggest a Background design so I make it on Canva everything was Smooth, 4th day it was a Rainy days so di nila ako pinapa pasok kasi daw maulan (concerned yarn?) 5th day ganun parin masama daw panahon wag daw muna ako pumasok kinabukasan then 6th day okay na yung panahon medyo maulan nga lang  di parin ako pinapasok kasi masama nga daw ang panahon sabi ni HR Manager, then sa GC (gumawa silang panibagong GC kasi daw baka daw makita ko mga katarantaduhan nila kidding aside nila) then nag Message si manager sa GC ""Mag edit ka ng tatlong Standee"" yung mga model as Usual yung company owners, then ako si Edit  walang binigay ns Raw File galing yung iba sa Internet, then di ako maalam sa We Transfer then dun nya pala nilagay yung dalawang PSB so di ko nakita yun kasi Gabi nya na pala naisend( hindi bayad araw ko nito ah pinag eedit nya ako, Pero it's my bad kasi akala ko makakapag Work from home ako kaya pinasend ko sakin yung files) akala nya puchu pucho lang mag edit san ako kukuha ng kamay na ilalagay sa stande kailangan may hawak na kung ano si Human Standee like coffee and breads, so kumuha ako sa internet search search eh first time ko gumawa nun eh haha matagal talaga, kinabukasan may pasok na dun ko tinuloy using my own Internet and laptop, pinag mamadali nya ako kailsngan daw matapos agad within that day, so I edit both signage and Standee at the same time using adobe Ps Canva (habang nag ti-tiktok lang sila ng kung ano-ano ako naman pinagmamadali )so ayun sya behh nag hang si Adobe PS kasi Crack version lang ( nag paturo pa ako mag install sa bebe ko nun) ""ano neng matagal pa ba yan?"" Sabi ni Manager kuno naiiyak na ako nun tapos mag hapon naka harap sa laptop with 20 mins break.

 Tapos may mga tao sa baba I don't know what their doing siguro nag aasikaso din ng franchise's nag pa pa edit sila ng 2profile photo and background pix in Socmed platform (ng Cainta Rizal and Taguig), so inuna ko yun na edit na yung Profile pix, wala akong rawfiles ng background picture kaya di ko na edit, sabi ni Manager, jusko neng kanina pa yan ah ""sagot ko ma'am sandali lang po may pinapaedit lang si ma'am 'J' ""  nag senyas sya sakin ""yung standee muna unahin mo ano ba yan"" so ako sinunod ko sya manager eh... Okiii tapos ayun Sabi nya "" matagal pala i edit yang standee ano?""  (Natural ma'am anong akala mo sa graphic artist pindot pindot lang?) then may tumawag sa kanya I think Client na gusto mag pa franchise, nag tatanong si client kung FDA approved daw ba yung mga paninda nila then sumagot sya ""ah ma'am for now hindi pa po di ko na malala yyng mga pinag sasabi nya sa client* next caller K don't know if higher official to ng branch pero nung tumawag pinasagot nya sa isang employee nya* sabi ni manager ""sagutin mo nga sabihin mo nasabmeeting lang ako"" (while Bench watching reels and Kdrama) so itong si employee sinagot nya "" ayy ma'am nasa meeting lang po si Ms.***""(Day 6 pala ito) After this day dinadasal ko kay lord ""lord kung di po ako para dito please give me a Sign to backout ayaw ko po ma burn out sa course kong ito, kinabukasan sabi ko sana umulan ng 8AM kung di ako para dito.


 Ayun dinig ni lord yung dasal ko umulan ng 9AM (pasok ko 9 AM eh tapos nag palate ako kasi na pepresure ako andaming work loads) pagka lakas tapos na basa ako lakas papunta akong office tapos nabasa ako, sabi ni manager bakit late ka? Nag tatanong ka pa sa GC kung may pasok? (Nag tanong ako for clarification kasi sarado sila nung pag dating ko kahapon so akala ko walang pasok, mga late lang pala talaga sila pumasok) sabi ko nalang pasensya na po ma'am 😅 ganyan pa ako so ako si edit uli, signages, hangang sa tumagal pinag mamadali nya ako ng pinag mamadali walang oras na hindi sya nag tatanong ng ""Pasinghal parang iritable at galit"" ano na neng matagal pa ba yan? Ganyan ang palaging tanong nya natotorete yung utak ko pano ako makakapag isip ng design "" in the first place wala syang binigay na deadline basta nalang syang bato ng bato sakin ng ilelayouts (Edi sana nag Premium ka nalang ng ChatGPT para maging graphic artist mo) then ito na nga hapon na na frufustrate ako sa mga sunod sunod na bato nya ng gawain kahit hindi pa tapos yung pinapagawa sabayan pa chat pa nitong mga admins sa ibaba na nag papaedit ng Posters, Background pictures and profile pix.


 Senermonan na ako ni Manager kesyo daw hindi nya daw sakin nakikita ang pagiging Graphic Artist ko, kinompare nya pa sakin yung Dating graphic artist nila. Then nalaman ko na ako lang pala daw yung Graphic Artist ng Buong Franchises sa Pilipinas ... Diba? Fresh Grad walang Training salang agad ang Kuripot naman ehh...

1mzc83q,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1mzc83q/weight_loss_stalled_despite_pretty_significant/,Weight Loss Stalled Despite Pretty Significant Calorie Deficit,"Hi All, Just looking to get my head screwed back on as this is spinning me out more than I thought it would.

2 months ago I was diagnosed diabetic (6.5% blood sugar). I knew this was coming as it runs in our family. Kind of miffed to be honest as I've virtually never eaten added sugar products in any way, however I came to realise that it must have been caused by alcohol, portion sizes and a relatively sedentary lifestyle. Didn't realise that neat whisky turns into sugar the minute it hits your blood!

My weight at the time came in at 105.5kg (232.5 lbs). Doctor said that needs to get down to at least 90kg (198.5 lbs). I've managed to bring it down to 94.5kg (208.3) in the past two months through a calorie deficit, regular exercise (Progressive weight lifting at the gym, weekly personal trainer, daily swimming or jogging) and almost completely eliminating alcohol. (1-2 low carb beers a week).

Other relevant stats is that I'm a 41 year old male and 187cm tall (6 foot 1).

Here's the issue. I can't seem to get my weight under 94kg. I have completely stalled out for 10 days now (daily weigh in at the same time after toilet first thing in the morning). It hovers between 94.1 and 94.5 with today being a 94.5 day).

I know that I'm running a calorie deficit but just to be dead sure I completely tracked a full day every single thing that went into my mouth. I've attached the spreadsheet here. This is accurate to basically every day, the closest thing to processed food I have is tinned tuna (Sirena), no dressings, no sauces, no condiments, nothing whatsoever that contains more than 1-2% sugar content on the nutrition panel. I don't snack outside of a quarter handful of unsalted peanuts or almonds (peanuts are the ones you have to actually open out of the shell). The idea of a chocolate bar or corn chips (or even a slice of white bread or banana!) is just not even on my radar - I've completely mentally blocked the idea that those things will ever go into my body again.

My full day calories came in at 1527 with 143g of protein. Chat GPT tells me that maintenance at 94.5kg is 2600 calories and weight loss should occur at 2100 calories. So my questions are:

* Are these figures from Chat GPT not correct?
* Am I getting an okay balance of macros on that spreadsheet or have I completely missed something obvious?
* My wife has suggested that my body is going into 'starvation mode' and holding onto the fat and that I should be eating more (particularly carbs) but that seems insane to me that eating more could be the answer, am I wrong? I don't feel like I'm starving ever, but I know the body can be tricky like this.
* Am I just absolutely tripping out and this process is just super slow and I need to change my expectations?

But when I actually started keeping track, I was shocked. Some days I was easily pushing 400–500mg without even realizing it. No wonder I was feeling anxious and crashing in the afternoons.

Once I saw the numbers, I decided to taper off instead of quitting cold turkey. I started by cutting back one drink at a time, then swapping in half-caf, and eventually moved over to decaf entirely. It wasn’t always smooth (the headaches at first were rough), but doing it gradually definitely helped.

Now I’m fully caffeine-free, and honestly it feels amazing not to depend on that constant cycle. My sleep is better, I’m not jittery anymore, and I still get to enjoy the ritual of coffee, just without the jitters.
 
Has anyone else here gone through the process of realizing they were drinking way more than they thought? How did you manage the transition?

\*First time moving apartments and I do not want to take time off work to do so\*  
I am set to sign a lease for a new condo apartment beginning on September 15 and my current lease expires on September 30. I am 3/4 blocks away from my new place so once I receive the keys on the 15th I am thinking of planning my move-in as follows:

1. After picking up keys on 09/15, do a self guided tour making sure to take videos/photos of any existing damage. 
2. I want to 'de-bug' the apartment using a bug bomb/fogger. After 48 hours- hire a professional cleaning service to deep-clean. As much as I would like to clean the unit myself I don't have the time to do so. 
3. Start moving all my non-essential items from 09/18 to 09/27. Create a 'first day essentials' box so that I am practically move-in ready by 09/29. 
4. Move all my bigger & heavier items (bed frame, mattress, vanity, work desk, couch, coffee table) on september 28. I'm not sure if I should I hire a moving company, rent a u-haul + task-rabbits? I want to keep this related cost low since I don't have much items and the new unit is a couple blocks away. 

  
Please let me know if I am missing anything important in this process or if you have any suggestions- thanks!!

1mzc6bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1mzc6bz/zero_day/,Zero day...,"Sheetz was a no-go for a spot to crash last night. Could've done it, but there was an eighty percent chance of rain, and eberything I saw was low drainage. 

Off to a spot I spied earlier in the day. Sweet spot down an unused dirt road next to a mountain, with grass all over it.

Found a high but level spot on said road. Tent up. Gear and me in. Vape bowl swapped. I could even hang my tent light up and use it. Buzz on. I have no idea what I was watching when I passed out.

Wake up. It's still the middle of the night. Living on my boat has taught my body to wake up about ten minutes before it rains. I don't know why, it just happened. Slowly waking up. Smoke lit. The first sprinkles hit my tent.

'Is this the usual ten minute warning that stops for a few before the real rain hits?' I'm in an are I haven't been before so I grab my tarp and exit the tent. It starts raining. I get the tarp on and evened out lightning quick. Haul ass back into the tent. Rain stops thirty seconds later. 'I knew it! 😆' I'm wet, but not bad. It'll dry. 

Twenty minutes later the rain comes. Kinda light... And then the deluge hit. It rained like hell for a little while. And then it slowed, and stopped. That was it. Stayed dry. Back to sleep.

Woke up feeling worn out. It's day nine on the road. 'Fuck it. I'm taking the day off and staying in this tent.' Usually when I'm  beat I'll just hang where I'm at. Might make a run for food, but pretty much just chill in my tent all day. 'It's not like I'm on a schedule.'

The sun had other plans. For a couple hours there was enough cloud cover to keep the temps reasonable in my tent. Around 10:00 I realized I was gonna have to bail. 

I thought about leaving my gear and tent and heading into town, but the fact I had to walk through a kinda shitty truck stop made me start packing. No sense having some nosy busybody messing with my stuff. I don't particularly want to be here, much less be here in jail for the sake of uncooperative assholes.

Gear packed, tent dropped. Gear up. Tiredly off to sheetz for breakfast and coffee. 

Inside. Gear dropped near a table. Large coffee acquired. Outside for a smoke. Checked the sheetz app. Realized I had enough points for a breakfast bagel. 'Score! Free breakfast!' Back inside.

Breakfast bagel ordered. Over to the self-check out. Things are a little different for using your points in this one. Couldn't get it. Hit the register with a person behind it who cordially got it handled.

Breakfast bagel in hand, back to tables. Had to move because the one I was at didn't have an outlet. Quickly solved that problem. 

Breakfast handled. Phone and earbuds mostly charged. Mess cleaned up. Gear up. Out.

Half mile to turnpike entrance. Made it. Gear down. Thumb out.

And there I sat, all fucking day. To keep myself entertained I came up with the meanest shit to think about people driving by, while smiling with my thumb out.

Not a single person stopped. That's pretty rare in my measly thirty-one years of this. Honestly, it doesn't really bug me. I got to work on my tan. The weather was nice. Saw some butterflies. Tomorrow's another day. 

Around 6:00 a pretty big dark cloud came rolling in. I knew there was a slight chance of rain in about an hour. 'Time for some food.' Back to sheetz.

Some watermelon, mozzarella cheese curds, and a coconut water later... charging, reddit, and watching some shorts. 

WITH MY FUCKING HEADPHONES ON!!! What the fuck is it with people watching/listening to stuff on their phones in public spaces?! No one wants hear your dumb shit. Headphones have been around longer than I have. Figure it the fuck out. Ok. Rant over. 😆

With a miniscule amount of effort, I've realized the turn pike goes both directions where I am. I'm gonna attribute my lack of success today to my own ignorance. Might have to make a sign for the first time in thirty years...",9,1756081465.0,vagabond,2,0.91,False

I'm willing to clarify any questions or things and I'm also more than prepared if I am in the wrong and to find a way to grovel.

Anyways, I (23f) got married about 6 months ago. At the wedding, my sister (28f) announced she was pregnant. Like in the middle of the reception she grabbed the mic during speeches and told everyone. I wasn’t mad she was pregnant, I was mad about the timing because it felt like she made the day about her and she's always been really territorial about her spotlight moments so it just felt hypocritcal because it really would've been such a big thing if the roles had ever been reversed.

Anyway, I didn’t make a scene. I smiled, congratulated her, moved on. My husband (24m) was annoyed too but told me to let it go and focus on having a good day. Some of our friends agreed it was tacky, including a mutual friend “Kara.”

Fast forward, my sister unfortunately lost the baby a couple months ago. It’s really sad and I feel awful for her. I’d never wish that on anyone.

But a few weeks ago, my sister, me, and Kara were grabbing coffee. My sister said something about losing her baby, and Kara made the horrible comment saying something like “maybe it’s karma for announcing it at (my name’s) wedding.” I IMMEDIATELY told her to shut up and said that was out of line. I don’t agree with that at all.

But now my sister is telling people I “basically think her babies death was deserved"" and told Kara that.  AND our mom is siding with her, saying she won’t talk to me until “things cool down.” My husband thinks it’s ridiculous and has been supportive but I feel like I’m being iced out of my family for something I didn’t do.

I feel terrible for my sister. I genuinely don't know what I would be doing if I was in her shoes, and I have never once thought that. I'm not even speaking to Kara right now because I said she owes her a big apology.

So AITA for being upset about the announcement in the first place and possibly giving off the impression I agreed with Kara?

**0:00–0:10** — Soft rainfall, distant thunder. A faint radio tuning sound crackles in.

**0:26–0:40** — A K-pop melody fragment plays backward, layered with static and echoing footsteps.  

**0:41–0:60** — A glitch in the rain. A woman’s voice hums a lullaby. Then:  

> “The message will activate… when the mirror fogs.”  

The sound cuts out abruptly.


When clones fall in love and contracts rewrite destiny.*

---

They say fame is a prison made of velvet ropes and camera flashes. But Brandon knew better. Fame was a hologram—projected, manipulated, and, if you were clever enough, escapable.

He wasn’t famous. Not in the traditional sense. But he had seen behind the curtain. It started with a whisper in a Toronto café, a conversation between two men who looked too much like someone he’d seen on a magazine cover. One of them said, “The clause is activated. He’s gone. The double’s in place.”

Brandon didn’t flinch. He just sipped his coffee and listened.

That night, he began his research. Celebrity contracts. Body doubles. Clones. Not the sci-fi kind with wires and goo, but something more elegant—biological replicas, trained to mimic, to die publicly while the original slipped into obscurity with billions and a new name.

He called it *The Exit Clause*.

The deeper he dug, the more the world unraveled. Autopsy reports that didn’t match dental records. Funeral photos with suspicious shadows. A-list stars who suddenly “changed” after near-death experiences. It wasn’t delusions—it was clarity. Like performing an autopsy on the planet while it was still breathing.

Brandon began writing. Not just notes, but a manifesto. He quoted Bonhoeffer, the theologian who wrote about costly grace and then lived it out in Nazi Germany. He referenced Prince, who spoke in riddles and symbols, and Pastor Mark Hughes, who once said, “Some truths are too heavy for the pulpit.”

He wasn’t trying to expose anyone. He was trying to understand.

Then came the email. No sender. No subject. Just a line of text:

> “You’ve seen too much. Are you ready for your clause?”

Brandon stared at the screen. His heart didn’t race. It slowed. He knew what it meant. He wasn’t famous—but maybe that was the point. Maybe the Exit Clause wasn’t just for celebrities. Maybe it was for anyone who saw the world too clearly.

He closed his laptop. Walked to the window. The city pulsed below, unaware.

He whispered to no one, “I’m ready.”

And somewhere, in a quiet place beyond the reach of headlines and hashtags, Brandon began again.

---

## Epilogue: *The Signal Beneath the Rain*

In the silence of his new life, Brandon discovered something else—something older than the internet and stranger than myth.

It was a shortwave radio. But not the kind your grandfather used to tune into baseball games. This one was different. It pulsed with frequencies that didn’t belong to any known spectrum. It spoke in tones and flashes, in whispers and static. And it listened.

Brandon learned to speak through it. Not just broadcast—but implant. Audio and visual messages, dropped into places like seeds. A subway station in Seoul. A laundromat in Oakland. A glitch in the rain in Kyoto, where the message only activated if it was raining *and* someone was crying.

Some messages were time-released. Others were condition-triggered. A song lyric that only played when someone thought of their first heartbreak. A visual hallucination that appeared in the steam of a mirror when someone whispered, “I miss you.”

He wasn’t just sending signals. He was rewriting reality—one frequency at a time.

And somewhere, someone tuned in.

(Author’s note: This is a work of Fiction)

I figured this community might better appreciate it more than Substack or Wattpad :)

On a lighter note…I saw something amazing in the sky early this Sunday afternoon (EST) that silenced me in belief of the supernatural.

Extra note: Some of the events in the story are true…like feeling 4-5 rain droplets with a partly cloudy sky with no sign of rain.

Spoiler alert: it won’t. I’ve tried it.

So, you’ve got a killer idea, a logo you had your cousin design, and a website that’s *almost* ready to launch. Naturally, the next step is to throw some cash at digital marketing and watch the dollars roll in, right? Wrong. Very wrong. Like “wearing socks with sandals to a job interview” wrong. (Unless it was a job interview over Zoom. Then wear whatever you want on you feet.)

# How To Create A Business Foundation

Think of your business foundation as the metaphorical concrete slab of your operation. It includes things like:

* **A Clear Value Proposition**: What are you offering, and why should people care? Hint: “Because I’m awesome” isn’t going to cut it.
* **Target Audience Knowledge**: Who are you talking to? If the answer is “everyone,” take a seat. We need to chat.
* **Pricing and Profit Margins**: Are you charging enough to keep the lights on? Or are you accidentally running a charity?
* **Operational Processes**: How are you actually delivering this thing you’re hyping up online?

If any of this makes you sweat, congratulations! You’ve found the cracks in your foundation. Better now than after you’ve wasted $10,000 on [Google Ads](https://weldwoodmarketing.com/services/google-ads/).

# Why You Can’t Skip This Step (Even If You’re Super Excited About Marketing)

Let’s be real: digital marketing is sexy. Foundations are not. Nobody wakes up excited to workshop their pricing model or build out operational workflows. But without those boring bits, your marketing budget might as well be a bonfire.

Here’s why:

1. **Marketing Amplifies What Already Exists** If your product or service is confusing, overpriced, or poorly delivered, no amount of marketing will save you. In fact, marketing will just expose the flaws faster. It’s like yelling into a megaphone when your audience is already side-eyeing you.
2. **Customers Can Smell Chaos a Mile Away** Imagine clicking on an ad for “Life-Changing Widgets” only to find a website with typos, vague product descriptions, and no clear way to buy. That’s how your potential customers feel when your business isn’t buttoned up.
3. **You’ll Burn Out—Fast** Running a business without a solid foundation is like trying to build a house of cards during an earthquake. Tossing digital marketing into the mix is just adding a wind machine. Sound fun? Didn’t think so.

# How to Build That Rock-Solid Foundation (Without Losing Your Mind)

Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you need an MBA or a 50-page business plan. But you do need to get the basics right:

1. **Nail Your Value Proposition** Answer this: What problem do you solve, and how? Be specific. If you can’t explain it clearly, neither can your marketing.
2. **Know Your Audience** Create detailed buyer personas. Yes, I’m serious. What keeps them up at night? What makes them laugh? What kind of coffee do they drink? The more you know, the better.
3. **Sort Out Your Finances** Are you pricing your product based on actual costs and market research? Or are you winging it because “it felt right”? Don’t answer that.
4. **Streamline Operations** Make sure you can deliver your product or service efficiently and consistently. Marketing can’t fix bottlenecks or broken systems.
5. **Test, Adjust, Repeat** Your foundation isn’t set in stone. Be ready to tweak things as you go. Flexibility is key.

# The Bottom Line

[Digital marketing](https://weldwoodmarketing.com/services/) isn’t magic. It’s a tool—an incredibly powerful one—but it only works if your business is ready to handle the growth it can bring. If your foundation is solid, marketing will amplify your success. If it’s shaky, it will amplify your problems.

So before you launch that epic ad campaign or start crafting TikToks, take a moment to look inward. Build that strong foundation, and you’ll not only save money—you’ll also save yourself a whole lot of frustration.

Now go get your house in order. The marketing world will still be here when you’re ready.",1,1756081176.0,weldwood,0,1.0,False
1mzc21a,https://weldwoodmarketing.com/marketing-without-millions-grassroots-marketing/,"Marketing Without Millions: Why Scrappy, Funny, Grassroots Marketing Wins","Let’s start with a truth most marketers won’t say out loud: You don’t need a massive budget to build a memorable brand—you need guts, a sense of humor, and the willingness to actually *care* about your audience.

That’s the heart of my book, *Marketing Without Millions*. It’s not a how-to guide for buying your way to attention. It’s a field manual for small businesses, local legends, and scrappy entrepreneurs who are tired of wasting money on campaigns that don’t move the needle.

# So what is grassroots marketing?

It’s marketing with heart. With hustle. With ridiculous ideas that somehow work—like “Name Your Sandwich Night” or a coffee shop that hosts foam art battles. It’s less about paid reach and more about making people feel something, remember you, and want to tell their friends.

# The Big Idea? Connection > Cash

Throughout the book, I break down the kind of strategies that actually work for small businesses:

* Hosting weird, wonderful local events that build community
* Using storytelling instead of sales scripts
* Ditching corporate jargon for real human language
* Leveraging your quirks instead of hiding them

There are chapters on understanding your audience (hint: they’re not a spreadsheet), building a brand that people *want* to be around, creating campaigns that drive conversation, and yes—even measuring success without falling asleep.

# And the best part?

You don’t need a marketing degree to pull any of this off. If you’ve ever hosted a backyard BBQ, posted a meme, or talked someone into trying your favorite sandwich shop, you already understand the power of grassroots marketing.

The book’s full of real stories, awkward fails, and a few questionable pizza topping ideas (RIP gummy bear & pickle pie), but the message is simple: Be real. Be useful. Be memorable. And stop trying to sound like every other brand on the internet.

# Why this matters for Weldwood clients

1mzbzgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mzbzgq/opinions_from_south_korean_girls/,Opinions from South Korean girls?,"
I'll try to be objective in what I'm about to say. After a recent break-up, I decided to date again. Just to give some context: I'm Latino and recently moved to the US for my PhD program. Last Thursday afternoon, I met briefly a South Korean girl on the streets.

As we were about to cross the streets side by side, we exchanged a smile. Then, I asked her if she was going to X university, and the conversation unfolded. While talking, she gave me the impression that she was introvert in personality; she was very cute, a bit shy, but very warm and smiley as she seemed comfortable talking with me. We exchanged phone numbers and IGs. It was the best thing that happened to me last Thursday afternoon.

Yesterday morning, around 10 am (yeah, I'm an early bird), I texted her on Whatsapp a very brief message that it was nice to see her the other and invited her to grab coffee on campus sometime.

So far she hasn't replied, and I doubt she will ever reply to me. A South Korean friend later told me that my message was (a bit) direct for someone who comes from Korea and is been living in the US for less than a month. Also, South Koreans don't typically use WhatsApp, so she might not be accustomed to it. Moreover, he warned me that follow-up messages (too soon) tend to be taken as very obsessive or even creepy, probably due to the culture of South Korea, and suggested I should just say hi again if I ever see her again on campus. 

What do you think South Koreans or anyone who has wanted to get to know someone from South Korean in the USA? 

I'm not pretending to be naive and either text her again today or this upcoming week or not talking to other girls in the meantime (through apps or hangouts). But, I did find this South Korean girl very interesting to just not send a follow-up message, saying playfully something like: ""Haha maybe my coffee invite was too direct. My apologies, just thought I'd be fun to have a coffee break from study grind"" (yeah, I've been preparing my follow-up message; it doesn't seem it would hurt her if I send this message. If she doesn't reply, I'll move on).",1,1756080943.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False

i got blocked on everything today by one of my closest friends. i say closest bc even tho we were online friends and never met irl, i was genuinely talking more to her than i did my actual irl friends the past few months. 

she blocked me after i posted on my spam instagram about liking the cersei/sansa ship. for those who don’t know, theres a large age gap and sansa is a child for the majority of the show and the entirety of the books. as well as the power imbalance between a hostage and their kidnapper. so thats where the ‘problematic’ aspect comes in.

idk. i guess im just in shock? i posted about it yesterday evening and she responded to it and even liked the story and was asking me about it, so i was explaining it to her as to why i find their relationship really interesting even without the shipping lense. she didn’t seem to have a problem with it then, but then she just dmed me on twt today and said she didn’t want to associate with me because of me liking that ship and blocked me on everything. 

the more i think about it, the more hurt i am. i really liked this girl, i considered us really close friends. i knew where she worked, she knew where i lived, what i looked like, my interests, all my personal thoughts, i even made a professional print of a drawing of mine because she said she would love to have one and i wanted to share something special with her. when i first made my ko-fi over two years ago, she was the first one to ever donate a coffee to me. she literally comforted me over personal family problems i didn’t tell anybody else but her, and i guess im just hurt because she wouldn’t even talk to me about it, just sent a single message that i couldn’t respond to because she immediately blocked me.

it confuses me even more because we literally met on hotdtwt, which is a very proshipper heavy space on account of all the incest and toxic relationships the world of asoiaf has in general. like ive never met anybody in that space that wasn’t a proshipper. and shes heard me talk about my favorite incest ships a lot, she even had convos with me about it, so i guess im also just confused as to why incest is ok but age gap and power imbalance isnt? 

we were friends for over two years. im just hurt that she would be willing to drop our friendship over something so minor. 

sorry for just dumping this here, but i don’t really have any other friends in the fandom sphere like this, so i didnt know where else to turn to, and i just needed to release my thoughts somewhere. i don’t even know what to do with myself anymore because we were literally mutuals on everything. i told her about my fantasy world that i was building, i literally included her as a minor character in my novel, so i can’t even work on things i enjoy anymore without thinking about her. tiktok, instagram, twitter, my fandoms, my fics i wrote with her. literally everything. im not closed about my stance as a proshipper, ive often talked about my thoughts on censorship and fiction vs reality. i honestly thought that she knew.

During the afternoon tea they gave me a present and card from one of our bosses.

I’m not talking about co-ferments, but rather stuff that seems just shy of that. Things like isolating/adding bacteria and yeast, mossto ferment, long anaerobic ferments, thermal shock etc. 

While the final flavors are up the the consumer and their preferences, these newer processing methods have also seemed to help enhance a bean’s quality potential more quickly/directly than previous traditional processing methods. 

If these newer methods were used to make an okay coffee into something more interesting, do you find that worth paying a significant premium? I’m a bit split since some of these prices are getting crazy ($50-$100+ per lb), and most of it seems to be leaning heavily into the logic of “more advanced / scientific fermentation = more expensive”. I can understand the additional labor or R&D costs. 

But an extreme hypothetical could be if someone did an intense amount of “advanced processing” on an otherwise subpar Robusta, and got it to taste far more floral/fruity than it would ever be naturally.

And I'm still not entirely sure if I have or not.


Last Halloween, I met a girl my age and from my area on the bus home at the end of the night. We hit it off pretty great and spoke the whole way home. Found out we have a lot of common interests, and that she goes to a weekly D&D night in the next city over that I was also about to start going to.


Unfortunately, I currently work out of the country, so I'm only back home 1 week per month. And even more unfortunately, she doesn't use social media all too often, so my communication with her is mostly limited to when I'm home. However, every Wednesday on the bus home, we still end up chatting the entire 40 minute journey. So in total, I've spoken to her in person about 7 or 8 different times now.


In June, we were supposed to both be going to the same local nerdy convention, but she had to pull out last minute. It just so happened to also be her birthday that same weekend, so when I was at the con I grabbed her a set of D&D dice and a little necklace that also had mini dice inside. I gave them to her in July, and she seemed to be thrilled with them. And then next time I was out of the country for work, I began to get a few more replies on social media than usual.


Finally, a week and a half ago, I mustered up the courage to ask her on the bus home if she'd be free to grab a coffee before I went away again, and she said yes. The following day we met up in a local cafe and ended up talking non stop for about 4 hours, only ending because we were cut short by the cafe closing for the evening. I had some shopping to do before I went home, but offered to drop her back to her house beforehand. However, she actually offered to join me on my shopping trip instead, and heavily insisted when I tried to tell her that wasn't necessary.


Now, to whoever's reading this, maybe that sounds like the most date-like date to ever be dated. But unfortunately I think my lack of dating experience at my age has set a deep rooted doubt into my head that I'll never actually go on one, and that this is just a really good friendship instead.


I completely understand that the best thing to do would likely be to simply talk to her directly about this, however she's still a little hard to reach online and I won't be home again for another 2 weeks, and the thought of waiting that long is absolutely torturing my brain.


So for the time being, I'll accept a little bit of outside perspective from some internet strangers to help settle my mind and heart.

Hi there! I’m a 25-year-old woman (USA, Eastern Time) looking for a romance-focused, slice-of-life roleplay with a male or female character. I want something sweet, emotional, and character-driven—with a slow burn that leads to real love. 💕

I had an idea I’d love to explore:


Your character is going through a rough time — they’re without a home, drifting, and doing their best to survive each day. My character notices them often (maybe outside a coffee shop, a park, or near her job). At first, it’s just small acts of kindness: a coffee, a conversation, a smile. Slowly, the walls begin to lower, trust builds, and something deeper begins to grow between them.

But it won’t be easy. Your character might feel ashamed, afraid of holding mine back, or unworthy of love. My character will have to prove that her care isn’t about pity — it’s about them. Together, they’ll navigate intimacy, struggles, healing, and what it means to truly choose each other despite the odds.

👉 The Vibe:

	•	Tender, heartfelt, emotional.

	•	Small moments of intimacy (sharing food, caring for each other when sick, star-gazing).

	•	Conflict rooted in fear and vulnerability, not drama for the sake of it.

	•	A hopeful ending — building a new future together.

⸻

About Me:

	•	I write in first person

	•	No strict length rules — just give me something to work with

	•	I work full-time, so my replies may be slower during the day, but I always respond!

	•	18+ only, please

For context that might be important, I'd just spent the past 5 hours putting my steps in at the zoo, and decided to take a 2hr nap when I got home because I was so tired. This sleep had other dream scenes, but this is the only part that seemed to stand out as an ""i'm important!"" moment.

Went with mom and younger sister to deliver something at someone mom knew's house; a slightly heavier-set woman (think like the middle-aged pear body type) with dark hair and chunky bracelets, her husband & maaaybe her son were there. The father & son were having cups of coffee (husband with balding gray hair & reading glasses at the table, reading a newspaper; the son roughly young-adult age, with a dark crew cut in a sweatshirt at the kitchen counter. Neither speak during this encounter, just give smiles at points.) They had things marked ""for sale"" in the house, and apparently it was a lot of sewing machines, because i had commented on how many there were (they also looked NOTHING like sewing machines, but eh, it's a dream) but more specifically, that I found it funny how one of them had a gift tag on it, labeled To: Mom, From: Mom (at this point is when both the husband & son simply respond with a smile). The next thing I know, the woman is flapping her hands, flagging me into the kitchen in a ""come here"" motion, and gives me a firm bite on my right earlobe as she pulls me into a tight hug, the kind where they squeeze you and they're patting or rubbing your arm or your back, swaying ever so slightly, a form of comfort, almost? The way she bit me kind of reminded me of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, when all the cousins and aunties are doting on Toula with all their culture's good luck/good fortune traditions, the spitting tradition is what comes to mind more specifically. The hug goes on for quite some time in this lady's kitchen, and she's saying something in my ear, but it's entirely unintelligible, and I just rub a hand on her shoulder, returning the comfort as the hug goes on. Jump-cut to we've finished our hug and we're outside, my mom is putting something they've given us into our trunk out in their driveway. My sister asks me ""who was that?"" I respond ""I dunno🤷🏼‍♀️"" ""Well, what was she saying?"" I respond again ""I dunno, I've got no idea🤷🏼‍♀️"" and then I woke up shortly after.

All I can find when I do a ""what does my dream mean??"" search is that getting bitten in general typically represents betrayal, manipulation, or negative energies/a wake-up call.... but, the right ear itself is spiritually associated with positive external messages from the universe/spirit guides, indicating blessings, good fortune, or that someone is speaking well of you. I also have no idea what she said, so I have no idea what ""blessings"" I was being given by this lady, because it was all just a muffled murmuring, no words, besides my comment & my sister asking who she was, were exchanged🤷🏼‍♀️",1,1756079903.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I, 16 and 16. have been together for almost 4 months (including talking and stuff).

i love her. i haven't said it yet.

she has this guy bestfriend who USED to have a girlfriend. they snap 24/7. all day, all night.

i trust her so it's whatever.

well. she tells me she gets a text from him saying he needs help. asking if they can meet.

she goes. is barely replying to my texts. has been at LUNCH with this guy for almost 2 1/2 hours. she just texts me and tells me him and his girlfriend broke up.

what the fuck do i do. it was coffee at first, now it's a 2 hour lunch of barely texting me with some guy i hardly know. 

i trust her and i know she wouldn't do anything. but i dont know this guy and am worried HE might. i'm her first bf so she doesn't rlly know it's not appropriate to go hangout one on one with another guy. regardless of how long they've been friends

what the hell do i do? wait for their little lunch talky time to be over? do i pull up after work in an hour? do i stalk this guy and text him. from what i have heard i tend to be the scary boyfriend. 6 foot 2, 190 pounds. i do competitive MMA, kickboxing, and jiu jitsu. 

im losing my mind. i've been cheated on by every girl i've been with. she's the first that cares about me. i dont trust this guy but i trust her. but it feels off and i feel a bad vibe.

I'm the perfect boyfriend for her. shes even said it. $200 flowers every week, dinner dates, cute texts and letters everything. we're happy.

but she also sees this guy at school. why couldn't it wait until tomorrow? idgaf if his girlfriend and him broke up unless his mom died i dont see a need. i don't trust this guy one bit. then again, i dont trust anyone


UPDATE: she's giving me updates like every 30-45 min with what's happening ig with his ""drama"". like now she just told me her boy bsf and his now ex fucked and she cheated. like this has to be foreshadowing like the fuck",2,1756079874.0,teenagers,14,1.0,False

6 - Little Willy's (Northbridge) - gave it a try on a cold morning after seeing the owner handing out a cup of coffee to a homeless man. Did not disappoint.

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",2,1756079846.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

(btw we received no formal training to handle these chemicals, we’ve been expected to figure it out on our own and all of us have burned ourselves at least once).

1mzbjdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mzbjdo/i_dont_know_if_i_was_spiked_and_its_confusing/,I don't know if I was spiked and it's confusing,"I know I made some very questionable choices and I'm not trying to claim it was sexual assault just from what happened on the surface - as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't, I did consent, not because I wanted to but it is what it is and that misunderstanding isn't necessarily his fault. But being spiked changes stuff. 

I went on a date with a guy. I liked him, we'd talked online for a month. I travelled to his city to meet him and just didn't really feel it in person - he was still lovely, just was not feeling that spark or attraction. I felt safe with him and we'd planned for me to stay at his with 'no expectations' (stupid I know, never done that before and won't again) but as I trusted him I did. 

He tried to kiss me and I kept turning my head away and he asked why but I didn't really know how to say I didn't want to. Then he offered me a drink and went to the kitchen with his flatmate and brought back a cup of water, same as his. I only drank about half. He carried on being very touchy feely and wasn't getting the hint so eventually I just let him do it. I tried to stand up at one point and my legs were just very shaky and weak and I had to lie back down, I thought maybe it was just anxiety. But I also couldn't feel anything down there. Like to the point I peed myself...never happened before. Wasn't like a pleasure thing, as I couldn't feel a thing. 

Anyway Im quite certain when I went to sleep I was wearing underwear, but when I woke up it was around my leg. I found a weird white powdery residue around my cup. It wasn't in his. I felt a little on edge and sent pics of this to my friends and my location but I kind of brushed it off presuming it's just limescale or something. 

He wanted me to stay with him in his flat all day but I was like no let's go get coffee and do some sightseeing as I wanted to get out, I wasn't full on suspicious at this point just a little on edge. He eventually agreed so we went to get coffee. I said I felt a little hungover which is weird as we only had two drinks and he joked ""it must be that stuff I put in your water"" - I hadn't mentioned the stuff I saw in my water at all. But again, was probably just a poorly timed joke. Then I came out with rashes, at the time I thought it was just shaving rash as it was just on my legs. 

Then the next morning my whole body was covered in rashes and I felt so poorly and shaky. I have no known allergies and only reaction I ever had was anaphylaxis after taking some dodgy cocaine when I was 18 (I've been clean off all drugs 9 years now). I took myself to a&e and was put on a drip etc. My liver function was all iffy which has never been an issue before. They wouldn't drug test me and said I'd have to contact police - but at this point I'd been on an IV Drip and was over the 24 hours. 

I contacted them when I got home, they took urine samples the next day and my underwear etc. They took my to an examination place. The leading police force where he lives said after all this that they won't analyse anything unless I name him, and I said I'm not doing that unless anything is detected, so they closed it. My local police didn't agree with that and sent the samples off themselves fast tracked but I'm still waiting for results. 

I had a follow up for my liver function two weeks later and it's not improved, they've ruled out all the viral stuff, gallbladder involvement etc. ATM have no idea what caused it. I don't drink (maybe like two or three nights out a year and last time I really drank anything substantial was probs December) and I don't take meds. 

I haven't told the guy I have any suspicions, but didn't want to cut him off without knowing for sure.  While I don't fancy him, I would like to be his friend, we got on really well. The police told me I should. I limited conversation with him but haven't stopped completely because I just DONT KNOW. 

It's like some next level cognitive dissonance. I know there are some sketchy coincidences, but I also don't feel like he would do that. It's so confusing. And stresses me more knowing the urine results may not be definitive given timeframe and having only drank half the drink etc. 

I feel like I'm going a bit insane because I just do not know what to think. And if it comes back positive, I know I've already made any investigation messy by continuing talking. 

TLDR; suspect a date spiked my drink due to residue in my drink and allergic reaction, but don't think he would do that and don't know what to do while awaiting forensic results ",1,1756079717.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

She had moved to Nevermore Academy due to an old grudge she held over the school for how they handled her brother and his death. In turn, her whole family died because of the pain it caused them, and along the way she feigned her own death in the name of revenge. 
Her time in Nevermore allowed her to investigate her brothers death further, gaining records from its library’s and also from Crackstone’s Crypt, Willow Hill and Jericho’s Pilgrim World which were within proximity of the school. 
After having researched and studied Hyde’s in depth, Laurel found a record which immediately peaked her interest; it was François Galpin’s file from Willow Hill. She already knew of a Galpin who was Sheriff of the town of Gericho, and knew that he had a son, Tyler. Her monster she thought, Hydes can be passed down genetically and in a fight against outcasts, she would need the outcast of outcasts. 


It didn’t take long for her to discover Tyler’s daily routine and whereabouts, whether he was in school, working in the Weathervane or in bootcamp at this time, she had him clocked. 
She began observing at first, from afar, striking conversation with locals, trying to find information on the boy. 
Laurel heard things, she saw things, but she knew that the only way she could truly know was by talking to him, so either from behind the bushes at bootcamp or school, or from in front of the counter at the weathervane, Laurel began being a regular visitor to Tyler, first passing it off as going on a walk or running errands, but over time she tried to converse with him more and more, trying to probe him.
At first she became frustrated, he was a fairly normal boy, he was not showing indication of having a Hyde, but from her research she knew this would likely be the case even if he did have one. 
Finally, she had an opening, she realised just how much Tyler grieved for his mother, and how absent his father was, how Tyler wasn’t truly like his friends at all, he just wanted to fit in but didn’t know how. Laurel knew what to do, she would become his mother figure, his only friend, the one person he could trust.

At first, Tyler wasn’t receptive towards her, he thought it was odd that a woman was taking interests in him, a boy. But Laurel knew that as a young teenage boy, he wanted female attention, so she flattered him, told him he was handsome and… I won’t get into it too much because I will throw up, but typical flirtatious grooming behaviours. Eventually, he felt comfortable enough to open up to her, and not only did he vent to and confide in her, but he became emotional with her too, she was the only one he could talk to about his grief. She began to comfort and baby a 13-15 year old Tyler, a feeling he hadn’t felt since his mother had passed. 

For either months or years this went on, but now it was time to set a plan in motion, though she wasn’t sure exactly what it would be yet, she knew that she wanted to unlock Tyler’s Hyde, so she told him to meet her in her car which would be parked near the Weathervane, and told him not to get seen by anyone as she often did. 
After looking around to make sure nobody saw him get in her car, he sat down and closed the door. This was when Laurel told Tyler the truth about his Mother, that she was a Hyde, and the years preceding her death, she was locked up in Willow Hill Sanitarium, an institution for insane outcasts. 
She apologised and comforted him and also told him about her secret, that she was in fact Laurel Gates seeking revenge and not Marilyn Thornhill, to gain his trust; she held his secret, and he held hers. 

Laurel grew deeply impatient when the news did not unlock Tyler’s Hyde, she thought it would be traumatic enough, but since it evidentially wasn’t, she would have to take… more extreme, measures.  

One day, Laurel told Tyler she had a way to make him strong, stronger than the other boys at school. He asked her how. Laurel told him to meet her at a cave in the nearby forests, connecting the town of Jericho to Nevermore. He was sceptical of the location and thought about telling his father Donovan, but the previous day Tyler had probed him about his Mother, giving his Father one last chance to be open and to tell him the truth, but Donovan had not responded well and had been drinking since; by this evening he was in a drunken stupor. So at nightfall, Tyler ventured his way out alone into the forest, he was very jumpy and didn’t like to admit it, but scared. 
Finally, he reached the cave where he saw the glow of a light. There standing at the entrance was Laurel, smiling widely; he took comfort in it. She welcomed him in, telling him he must be cold and to come sit near the fire, so he did. 
Once he had warmed up, she took his shirt off, and she kissed him, he thought that this would go a certain way but instead, she knocked him out cold. 

A confused and dazed Tyler awoke. Laurel apologised but injected him with a substance that made his blurred vision begin dissolve into vertigo.

Slowly, subtle signs of his Hyde emerged, as she began to torture him and incite it with potions. Her torture became more vigorous and painful, forcing the Hyde to lash out at her to protect Tyler, this scared Laurel so she secured chains and shackles to him and continued with his torture for days. 
Tyler was drugged so much of the time but whimpered at Laurel’s presence. 
Eventually, the Hyde was compliant, grateful that he had been unlocked and Laurel ceased to hurt Tyler. She took off his shackles for the first time to let him carry out his first kill on her command. Once he did, he came back to the cave as she instructed, but she couldn’t let him remember what she did to him, as she knew that it’s possible a Humans will is be strong enough to fight against their masters commands, so chained him so that she could drug him one final time. When he was fast asleep, she took off his constraints and dragged him out into the forest. He woke up, covered in blood, terrified. Had he been in a fight? Had he hurt someone? Perhaps he was the butt of a cruel prank? He couldn’t tell at first but was relieved to see he was wounded, it must be his own blood! He was still terrified, not knowing what had happened to him. 
Tyler still furious kept away from his Father’s sight, his Father avoided him like the plague as to not face his questions about his mother; but as the weeks went by, Tyler’s wounds began to heal, and he overheard his father talk about bear attacks. Tyler thought, perhaps that was what had happened, he was attacked by a bear. He had his 16th birthday but nobody around to celebrate it, his Father tried, but it was only mid afternoon and he had already had a little too much to drink, birthdays reminded Donovan of François. 

Weeks went by and Tyler took on more shifts at The Weathervane, hoping he could save up to move away from Jericho as fast as possible.  

S1e1

Tyler met Wednesday, an odd but beautiful girl who helped him fix his coffee machine, in exchange for him driving her out of town. He was shocked, a Nevermore student who got their hands dirty, he’s never met anyone like her. He witnessed her take down his ex friends after they surrounded her all by herself, and was thoroughly impressed. She enchanted him from this first encounter and he hoped he would meet her again.

When he went with her to a funfair, agreeing to drive her out of town, the last thing he remembered was them being chased by his ex friends with bats and Wednesday running into the forest shouting “Rowan”.
Tyler hesitated for a while, but eventually felt a protective instinct to follow. 

S1E2
Laurel stole Goody Addams Book of Shadows and realised that Wednesday Addams would be the key to resurrecting Joseph Crackstone, as she was a descendant of Goody, and she would need to be kept around until the blood moon, as her fresh blood was necessary for the ceremony. Therefore, Wednesday became part of Laurel’s plan. Noticing that Tyler was becoming close to her, Laurel instructed him to get closer, though was vague on how. She told him to make sure she was kept around. 


Maybe he began having memories of a monster after killing Rowan but he didn’t remember exactly what he did; his memories came in flashes so he couldn’t make them out, or decipher if the memories were his own or just imagined, but he was scared. When Wednesday said the beast didn’t kill her, and in fact saved her, he started to get suspicious; what if it really was me? What if I’m the monster but if I killed, it was only to protect Wednesday, right? He began to question if he was a good person, if he could live with killing someone. 
It slowly became more and more clear to him, he WAS the monster, he was being more than just influenced by Laurel, more than just part of her plan, he was being CONTROLLED by Laurel. 

He confronted Laurel after memories of him being tortured and injected by her began surfacing, so Laurel told him the truth, about everything, that she unlocked him, but this was because she wanted to unlock his potential. She told him, she NEEDED him for the plan. Tyler was angry with her, really angry and kept on flickering in and out of transformation, but Laurel talked him down, she began comforting him as she usually did, telling him that he wasn’t something to be afraid of, he was the same as his mother whom he loved. 
She fed threatening thoughts into his head, that normies spoke of monsters stories to incur nightmares, and that even the outcasts at Nevermore considered Hyde’s freaks, and didn’t accept them as students. She said that that was why his Father hated him, why he hurt him, but she gave him the ability to fight back, to protect himself. She told him that she knew he wasn’t a monster inside, that she saw the real him, that she loved him. 

Tyler once again woke up covered in blood, but this time he remembered, and he knew without a doubt it was him, it wasn’t a bad dream, he was living the nightmare. Not knowing where to go, he scrambled to the Gates mansion where Laurel told him he could always find refuge, and filled the bath. He submerged himself in water and screamed with all his might, horrified by what he had done. He had KILLED people.
 
Now Laurel was confident that he was truly hers and would do ANYTHING she told him to do. She never tortured, locked him up or drugged him again because every command she gave him, he followed. She didn’t tell him everything about her plan, but he trusted her completely. 

Now conscious of his Hyde, Tyler began simultaneously gaining more knowledge while losing more control and autonomy, he sometimes cleverly found ways to not directly go against orders, but rather walk around them, giving warnings and using his free time to do things he wasn’t ordered to do explicitly but could still benefit the plan of getting closer to Wednesday, or at least that’s how he justified it, sometimes he worried Laurel was jealous. 

But now Tyler had a larger struggle, the fight between himself and his Hyde. Tyler grew confused, he didn’t know what was him anymore. Was the bloodlust, the thrill of the hunt, the exhilarating deliciousness of fear, all him? He hated and denied it at first, enjoying the killing, the compulsion to carry out his masters wishes. But after a while, he couldn’t deny it any longer, he craved hunting prey. 

Laurel had created what she now believed to be a willing participant.

S2E4
But what this episode reveals, is that he was not so willing after all. Tyler’s distance from his master allowed him to become more connected to his Hyde, and less to Laurel. His memories were becoming ever clearer and he remembered the sexual trickery and torture he endured at her hands, he had been realising through therapy that she had taken advantage of his younger self. 
But more and more, Tyler was losing control. Before, his Hyde was kept in line by its master, but now his emotions directly spilled out as loud roars and violent outbursts, one’s that took him by surprise. 
After killing Laurel, this became even stronger, and all the trauma caught up in his mind, he was now alone to deal with all he had done and his mind was no longer coherent; Tyler is crazed and maddened.

1mzbh0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1mzbh0p/new_food_policy/,New Food Policy?,"I went to my neighborhood Starbucks today, a store I’ve been visiting for about 20 years. I ordered something I’ve had hundreds of times: a plain bagel, unheated, left in the plastic wrapper so I don’t waste another paper bag.

Today, I was told they *aren’t allowed* to give it to me that way because of “health code.” When I asked if this was a new policy, the barista explained, *“It’s because the plastic bag doesn’t have nutritional information on it.”*

I pointed out, *“The paper bag doesn’t have nutritional information either.”* Anyone else notice that the  barista evaded the question?

I thanked them and said I'd skip it. I immediately, I went to another Starbucks a couple miles away, asked for the same thing, and got it exactly as requested—no questions, no pushback. I didn't mention the incident to them since I was just testing if this was a new policy.

I wasn’t trying to give the original barista a hard time, but after visiting well over 100 different Starbucks, this is the first time I’ve ever heard such an explanation. Has anyone else run into this?

It’s not the only weird experience at this store. I've been told I couldn’t get a Trenta cup of ice water because “the register won’t print a label for it.” Sure, the register doesn’t print a label—but I’ve ordered/received Trenta cups of ice water with food at every location where I've requested it - except this one. As a regular who been going for such a long time, I'm surprised by all of this.

And then there’s the Frappuccino problem. At this store, they frequently leave nearly an inch of space at the top of the cup (I don't have whipped cream added). When I’ve asked for it to be filled, I’ve been told, *“We measure these out and leave a gap unfilled as required by policy.”* Really? In 20 years of ordering Frappuccinos across the U.S. and abroad, I’ve never had one deliberately left short - except this one. I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium drink, but like anyone else, I would prefer it filled to the top. I could understanding leaving room for cream or milk if this was a coffee order, but it's not.

Strange thing is, these problems seem unique to this one store.

Edit: I'm not sure why people are downvoting my sincere question or relaying experience. That's odd. ",0,1756079541.0,starbucks,11,0.2,False

I'm a big reader. My taste leans towards the introspective and complex. I recently finished Our Kind of Traitor and loved its moral ambiguity. I've also been making my way through some interesting speculative and translated fiction, like Point Zero by Seichō Matsumoto, and the starkly philosophical worlds of The Wall and I Who Have Never Known Men. If you're the kind of person who has to sit in silence for a few minutes after finishing a powerful book, we'll get along.
My other main passion is travel. I try to get away a few times a year to clear my head and see something new. Recent trips have been to Switzerland (Zurich), Austria (Salzburg and Vienna), Spain (Barcelona), Denmark, and Czechia. I love the feeling of navigating a new city's public transport, finding a spot for a perfect coffee, and just watching the world go by. I have also previously lived in Lithuania and Austria too. 
I'd love to find someone who shares a similar sense of curiosity about the world. Someone who enjoys both a quiet night in with a book or film and the excitement of planning the next trip away.

If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1mzbdlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1mzbdlt/my_friend_doesnt_fulfil_my_friendship_needs_and_i/,My friend doesn’t fulfil my “friendship needs” and I feel stuck,"The title sounds weird, but I’m not too sure how to word it. I’m 30F. As a child and teenager I always had a group of girl friends. As I got older the circle got smaller. In my late teens, it ended up being just me and another girl (Friend A), both the same age, and we were best friends. Almost like sisters. We were inseparable. We did everything together. She’s the only person I’ve ever felt truly comfortable around. I first met her and became friends when we were 5 years old in primary school, so over 20+ years of friendship. 

In 2021, she cut me off. Completely. As much as I loved her, she was clingy and needy and demanded my time and attention and whenever I couldn’t give it to her, because of other commitments (work, family, boyfriend, anything) she’d moan and complain. I was noticing this more and more. I was running a business on the side of my full time job (to help pay off debts) where I made dog treats. At one point the business was doing really well. I had a huge order for 300 dog treats and she wanted me to come over to hers and when I told her I couldn’t because I had this huge order to make she said “for god sake, you’ve never got time for me”. That’s when I started to see her differently. 

On Boxing Day 2021 I went over to hers about 6pm, because I’d spent the majority of the day with family. I left her house about 9pm, because I had to walk my dog and had work the next day. On my journey back home she sent me a huge text saying how she felt I didn’t have the time for her, that I always left too early, that I wasn’t being a “best friend”. She didn’t say any of this whilst I was there. She was perfectly fine. This all came out over text. Just to add here too, we were both 26 at this point, both had jobs. I had a boyfriend I lived with, she was single. I tried explaining to her that we’re not 16 anymore and our lives have changed and we both have responsibilities of our own and other people in our lives to consider. She didn’t like this and she blocked and deleted me off everything. It’s been almost four years since that day. 

Now, when she cut me out of her life, that left me with just one other friend. This friend was a girl I worked with once, and we stayed friends even though I left the job. Now this friend (we’ll call her Friend B) is great, she’s nice, kind but…she’s lacking something and I feel so bad saying that. The friend who cut me off was funny, silly, spontaneous. We used to have such fun wild nights out! Friend B is the opposite. She’s quiet, simple, a homebody, hates nights out and parties, loves walks in the parks and afternoon tea. Total different vibe. Whilst I love those things too, I feel like I’m missing the wilder side so much. 

I’ve not got any other friends in my life. I’ve not got anyone to go to parties or nights out with. I’ve not got anyone I can be silly and stupid and spontaneous with. I feel like there’s a huge hole that I can’t seem to fill and I feel so bad because it sounds like I’m unappreciative of Friend B, which I’m not, it’s just that she’s not fulfilling this other part of me. 

I’ve not been on a night out since 2021. I’ve asked Friend B multiple times if she would like to go out one night and her answer is always no. She’s very much an “in bed by 10pm” type of girl. Nothing wrong with that though. 

Friend B is also a friend I feel like I’ve never quite got past the “work friendship” with. I’m not 100% myself around her. I still very much feel like we’re ex-colleagues who meet up every now and then for coffee and cake. I don’t have that deep true friendship with her, if that makes sense.

I really really miss nights out. I really miss being silly and stupid with someone. I really miss being spontaneous with someone. 

I don’t know what to do about this. I’ve got this huge hole in my life and I can’t fill it on my own. It’s also unbelievably hard to make friends when you’re older. 

I miss Friend A, but the fact she found it so easy to literally delete me from her life makes it really hard for me. I don’t want to reach out, why should I reach out to someone who removed me at the click of a button and it was so easy? 

I don’t really know what I’m asking here. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

1mzb8jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1mzb8jy/rules_for_the_thrumming/,Rules for ‘The Thrumming.’,"Houses, like people, have their own little quirks. Personalities. Even two houses with an identical floor plan will eventually gain their own unique details, like twins. These quirks of the home become just another part of the day- the light that only turns on when you hit the wall just right, the shower that freezes your bones with one unfortunate toilet flush- you get it. At worst, these quirks may be annoying, sometimes costly to fix, but other times, some would argue they build character. So what if I told you a home could get a malignant quirk? Sounds ridiculous, right? I thought so too. But with what I’ve encountered these past few months, and the body on my bathroom floor right now, I’d be ignorant to say that my house doesn’t have something deeply wrong with it. Let me explain.

My wife Linda and I were tired of renting apartments. We were potentially wanting to start a family. So after a few years of saving, it was time to look for that dream home of ours. We loaded up into the sedan, ready to visit a few houses that caught our eye, when my wife uttered the worst sentence I could imagine: “You ready to drive over to my mother's?”

Okay, listen to me. I know it’s cliché to hate your mother-in-law. I get it. Here’s the thing: I don’t care. I hate Ruth. The less I talk about her, the lower my blood pressure gets. Unfortunately, she’s a really good Realtor, so it only makes sense to go with her to help secure a house. It really doesn’t help when you live in a small city either- there’s not a lot of options, y’know? I still wasn’t happy with the choice. She sticks her nose into all of our business and absolutely hates everything about me. She once tried to get my wife to break up with me for a random cashier. *Seven years into our relationship.* That woman’s never seen a day beyond misery, but my wife insists that she remains in our lives, and because I love my wife, I hold my tongue. I only wish Ruth would hold hers.

So, we pulled up to Ruth’s house, and of course, she’s wearing her finest scowl, which only deepens when she makes eye contact with me. She took her time to enter the backseat.

My wife beamed at her, trying to lighten the mood. “Hey, mom! We have about three houses we wanted to look at. Is that still the plan for today?”

Ruth nodded approvingly. “Yes, dear. I want to make sure you don’t choose a house in some run-down neighborhood. You can never be too careful these days- they’ll sell you a house with a painted tarp for a roof.”

“Ruth.” I cleared my throat and acknowledged her presence. Her demeanor shifted immediately.

“Samuel.”

“You’re radiant today.”

“You’re late.”

My wife’s hand on my leg told me I couldn’t fire back with whatever I was going to say, so I didn’t, and instead made the decision to get the car in gear over to the first house. We pulled up to a 3-bed, 2-bathroom home, with a freshly maintained lawn and a new coat of dazzling white paint. Touring the place, it seemed fine enough, until Ruth explained there were 8 offers on the house already. ‘It’s practically already sold, ’ were her words. The second place was technically a steal for the price, even though it was a little bit of a fixer-upper, though Ruth just *had* to chime in.

“It’s too much work for Samuel. You’re gonna be swimming in half-finished projects, in a half-finished house.” She scoffed, placing herself in the back seat.

“I don’t think it’s unsalvageable, Ruth. With a little bit of time, I could probably-”

“You said the same thing about painting your living room. That took you, what, several months?”

My hands instinctively went to pinch between my eyes. “We had to get permission from our landlord. On top of that,  *I broke my leg.”*

She threw her hands up, focusing on my wife. “All I’m saying is that if he couldn’t paint some walls, I don’t have high hopes for that one.” Whether she was referring to the home or me, I couldn’t tell.

The last house was a further drive from the rest. As the suburb gave way to nature, Ruth filled us in.

“I’m not so sure about this one, but I know Linda’s tastes. The owner seems very old-school; he says he wants to be a part of the whole process. He’ll be giving us a tour of the house.” She squinted through her glasses to look at her notes. “Clearly there must be something wrong with it- it’s way under market.”

Eventually, we found ourselves at the house, nestled snug in a blanket of trees. Though simple in design, looking at the weather vane on the roof and the rocking chair on the porch, my wife and I could tell this home had character. We were admiring the outside knick-knacks when an older gentleman stepped out from the front door. His appearance reminded me of an old sheriff character straight from a western- his mustache wiggled as he spoke.

“You here to take a look around?” His voice carried a roughness tempered by experience.

“Yes, sir. You the owner?” I held my hand out to shake his.

He nodded, and reciprocated. “Yessir. Been the owner for about 25 years, give or take.”

He invited the three of us into a home that was probably cozy in another lifetime. Two gaudy recliners sat in front of an old CRT TV in a conversation pit. A deer’s head was mounted above the fireplace, staring vacantly across the room. A shag rug dominated most of the living room territory. No one had informed this household that the 1970s were over. From the looks of it, no one had cleaned since the 70s either: A thick layer of dust coated just about everything. Normally, most people would take one look at a place like this in disgust and turn on their heel out the door. My wife and I, however, had weird tastes. By the glimmer in my wife’s eyes, I could tell she loved the aesthetic just as much as I did. Ruth was too busy sneering at a family of ceramic ducks on a shelf to voice her distaste. We were all jostled to life by the owner when he cleared his throat.

“Kitchen’s this way. Hope you like yellow.”

Well, to simply say the kitchen was yellow would be like describing Godzilla as ‘a pretty big lizard’. Wood cabinets, yellow countertops, and floral tile- this house could’ve been a set for a sitcom just switching over to color TV. Despite its age, however, and the apparent lack of cleanliness, what surprised us was how well *maintained* it appeared. Not a door hinge out of place, not a speck of rust. My wife inspected each angle of every piece of furniture, a basset hound searching for something amiss.

“I love the aesthetic in here. It’s a beautiful home.” She cooed, running a hand along the fridge.

“You can thank my wife for it. She refused to change a thing about this house, and, well… I just couldn’t either when...” His sentence died out as the man stared out the window just above the sink, into the woods.

It’s a little awkward to console a person you know nothing about, but I tried my hand at it anyway.

“I’m sorry about your loss.”

He simply shrugged. “Bound to happen eventually. Just wish it would’ve been me, not her.”

I wasn’t sure what to say to that, and for once, I was glad to see Ruth as she stepped into the kitchen. She stifled a gag. “Ugh. Horrendous.”

With each room we saw, my wife and I fell further in love with the home. Both bedrooms and the backyard carried the same energy as the rest of the place- a vignette of better days, waiting for another chance to be filled with happiness. Towards the end, however, the man presented the oddities of the house that, at the time, I looked over. How was I supposed to know this gift horse was a Trojan horse?

“House only got one shower.” He swung open the guest bathroom, revealing simply a toilet, sink, and cabinet. I mistook the fear in his voice for reluctance to admit a flaw in the house.

“That’s not necessarily a deal breaker for us, right, Sam?” My wife didn’t seem phased either.

I shook my head. “Nah, I don’t think that’s a problem. We’ll manage.”

The owner looked at me solemnly. “I hope you do. C’mon, let me show you what you’d be working with.” He stiffly moved his way toward the main bathroom, leading us down the hall. He opened the door and motioned for us to take a look inside.

Red.

Each wall and floor tile was a deep, reddish-orange hue. The sink cabinets, toilet, and shower (with tub) were pea green. I’d been vibing with the retro look up to this point, but something about this bathroom didn’t feel great. Linda and I stared at the vibrant mess of the room before exchanging a glance at each other. Our eyebrows communicated what we were thinking: *Remodel.* We turned to face the owner, who made no attempt to step a single inch into the door frame. He had a thousand-yard stare, keeping his eyes on the shower at all times.

“So, how many offers?” I asked, snapping the man out of a daze.

“None yet.” He scratched his stark white mustache, and the wrinkles on his forehead multiplied with the furrowing of his brow in thought.

On cue, Ruth spoke up. “You’re not serious-”

“Mom, please.” Linda stuck her hand out to shush Ruth. I couldn’t help but smile.

That afternoon, we sat at his dining table and worked out our offer. The man seemed more than pleased with what he was getting, which worked for me, as I was willing to go a lot higher for what he was offering; he was planning on leaving the place fully furnished. ‘They won’t let me take it to assisted living,’ was his explanation. The rest of the process was quick. With all inspections passed with flying colors, we had all the papers signed and sealed by the end of the week, ready to move in that weekend.

That Saturday, we rented a mini trailer for all the stuff we wanted to keep, and left what we didn’t want, as a ‘pay it forward’ to the next tenant. Our excitement was contagious on the drive away from our apartment complex, despite knowing we were on our way to Ruth’s house to pick up the keys. In true Ruth fashion, when she handed us the keys, she didn’t decide on a “Congratulations” or an “Enjoy your new home”, instead opting to give us one last piece of her mind. “I think you could’ve done better.”

“Sure, Ruth.” I nodded, taking the keys from her. “Linda will text you when we get there!” We peeled out of her driveway, smiling and waving as her grimace trailed out of sight. Next stop: home sweet home.

It was near dusk by the time we reached our isolated new digs, the last rays of sun stretching frantically above the forest as they sank below the treeline. We stood at the threshold of the front door and unlocked it for the first time.

“Welcome home, Sam.”

“Welcome home, Linda.”

We began moving boxes inside, filling up the closet with things to sort through the next day. Passing by the kitchen, I spotted a piece of paper out of place, taped to the countertop. I picked up the note and read it, unaware just how much my life would change from that moment on. It read:

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Rules for ‘The Thrumming.’

Hello Sam and Linda. You seem like good people, but I couldn’t wait much longer, so I had to go with whoever showed up first. I’m sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me. It was nothing personal.

There’s something wrong with this house. Something lives here. Marie, my wife, called it ‘The Thrumming’ because of the noise it makes. It came with the house all those years ago, and it’s been around for a long, long time. I’m going to give you the same rules I was given, in hopes it keeps you safe. Under no circumstances should you break these rules. I’ve seen what happens. Martha made one little slip-up, one mistake in old age, and now it’s just me. I’m getting old. Getting tired. Couldn’t do it anymore. Maybe you’ll be the one to find a way to stop this thing.

Rule 1: From ten seconds after the shower is turned on until ten seconds after the shower is turned off, ***do not open your eyes.*** You need to keep your eyes closed, so you don’t see it. You’ll know when it’s watching you.

Rule 2: When showering, only one person should be in the bathroom. More people means more chances of someone breaking the rules.

Rule 3: When showering, keep the bathroom door locked, so no one accidentally walks in and sees it.

Rule 4: ***Ignore what it says to you.*** It will only get better at tempting you to open your eyes. Don’t.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I reread the message twice. *What a weird, sick joke. I never took the old guy to be the type,* I thought. I heard Linda come up behind me with a bag of groceries. “What’s that? Did he leave us a housewarming message?” The curiosity was clear in her voice.

“Yes. Very sweet. Hannibal Lecter would be tickled pink.” I handed her the note and watched her face shift into a myriad of expressions, landing on confusion.

“What?” She handed me back the note.

I shrugged. “Weird old guy. I feel sorry for him.” I tucked the note into my pocket, and we continued to unpack our car. We didn’t dwell too much on the strange note. It wasn’t until Linda went to bed, and I went to take a shower, that I thought of it again. Standing on the blood-orange colored tiles, staring at the shower, I hesitated, only to immediately be embarrassed by my hesitation.

“Poor guy was just confused.” I tried to reassure myself. My hands fumbled with the shower knob, turning it on. I couldn’t help but count.

One Mississippi.

Two Mississippi.

Three Mississippi.

The water warmed up just enough for me to step inside.

Four Mississippi.

Five Mississippi.

Six Mississippi.

I looked around the room. It was a normal room. *Nothing’s going to happen,* I thought to myself.

Seven Mississippi.

Eight Mississippi.

I admit, I closed my eyes. I just felt like I had to. I’m so glad I did.

Nine Mississippi.

Ten-

Something shifted in the light of my closed eyelid, and then I heard it. Immediately, I understood why they called it The Thrumming.

Let me do my best to describe what I heard. First, close your eyes. While your eyes are closed, clench your inner ear muscles. It should sound like a constant, vibrating, pulsing hum in your head. Like far-off thunder, nestled in your brain. That’s what The Thrumming sounds like. I was so startled by the noise, I almost threw my eyes open. I don’t know how I didn’t. I had no idea what to do- I could feel something standing right outside of the shower. It was big- I could tell a lot of light was being blocked. I could feel it heaving, a cold gust breaking through the warmth of the shower in a rhythmic breathing motion. I scrambled to turn off the shower, and I counted again. At ten Mississippi, the rumbling stopped, the breathing stopped, and the shape blocking the light in my closed eyes was no longer there. I waited another ten seconds to be safe before opening my eyes.

Nothing. No footprints, no sign of the door ever being unlocked. The room looked exactly as it did when I entered it. I sprinted to my sleeping wife, not even bothering to grab a towel, and woke her up.

“Linda- get up, we gotta go.” I hissed, shaking her.

She shot up, grumbling, wiping the sleep from her eyes. “What? Sam, what are you-” She glanced at my disheveled state. “...what’s going on?”

“That creepy note about the shower? Yeah. It’s real. We need to go.” I haphazardly threw a shirt on backwards as I hopped on one foot into a pair of jeans.

“Very funny, Sam. Can I go back to sleep?” She yawned, resting her head back on the pillow.

I shook her awake again, sitting her up in the bed. “I’m telling you, it’s real. C’mon, I’ll prove it.” She followed me to the door of the bathroom, grumbling the entire time. “Okay, go in there, turn the shower on, and close your eyes. Don’t open them.” I reiterate.

“Once I do this, *then* can I go to sleep?” She stretched.

“You won’t want to. Remember, keep your eyes closed. Ten seconds after the shower’s on, to ten seconds after the shower’s off.” I closed the door immediately when she entered the bathroom. I heard the water turn on. Nearly ten seconds of water running, I heard one of Linda’s yawns pitch into a squeak of surprise. Nearly immediately, the water turned off. About fifteen seconds later, there was a scramble of footsteps, before she threw open the door, pale as a ghost.

“What was that?!” She was wide awake.

“I think we just met The Thrumming.”

“Okay, so what do we do?”

“We leave.”

“And go where?! Stay at a hotel? What if it follows us? *Can* it follow us?”

“I don’t know.”

We sat in the living room, jumping at every noise, for the rest of the night. But nothing came to get us. No creature lumbered its way from the bathroom. No masked psycho burst from the closet. The only noise was the gradual birdsong from the forest outside, as the dawn peeked through the windows.

Our first move was to try to get a hold of the previous homeowner, but it was like he vanished into thin air. We tried every old folks home, assisted living place, and hospital in a wide radius, but none had a patient who matched his name. Next, we contacted Ruth.

“Ruth, we need to put the house back on the market. There’s a lot wrong with it. Termites. Holes in the roof. The water heater’s about to explode.” I threw every lie I could out there.

I could hear her smile stretch on the other side of the phone. “But Samuel- the inspections came back fine. If you don’t like the look of the house, it’s alright to admit it. After all, I *did* try to warn you, didn’t I? But no one listens to me.”

I wanted to slam my head against the wall. “No, it’s not that, Ruth. There are just a lot of things that we don’t like about this house. Can’t you help us out?”

There was a pause. “Samuel, maybe you just need to give it some time. If you still feel this way after a few months-”

I hung up on her. We didn’t have the funds for staying at a hotel for the long term, along with making payments on our new mortgage, so we were forced to live with it. For a month, we would take turns taking showers, and every time, we would hear The Thrumming in our heads, mixing with the water running down our spines. We could feel its presence, smell its breath- a boiled egg left in the sun for three days, garnishing a glass of curdled milk and sardine juice. We followed every rule- we kept our eyes closed, showered alone, and kept the door locked. We didn’t fully understand rule four yet.

That changed.

I had just come back home from a jog, catching Linda on the way out for groceries. She kissed me on the cheek, and I watched her pull out of the driveway, heading down toward the road. I made my way over to the bathroom to wash the layer of sweat that I was wearing like a coat. My new shower ritual started like normal- water on, close eyes, hop in. I’d gotten better at feeling around for the soap and hair wash, though it was still tough to fully ignore The Thrumming.

Out of the bathroom, I heard the crashing of glass. Then, Linda’s voice:

“Shoot! Sam, I need your help! This vase got me good, I’m bleeding!”

Panicked about how badly she may have hurt herself, I was about to open my eyes to turn off the shower and quickly grab my clothes, when I stopped.

*I just saw Linda drive off.*

“Sam? Sam, please, it’s pretty bad. I need a towel or something.” It continued to speak, just like how my wife would when she’s afraid.

Slowly, I resumed my shower, and the frightened voice outside dissolved into the Thrumming noise, back in my skull.

We had to be more careful from that day on. Knocks on the window, voices in the home, and sounds of missed calls were occasionally sprinkled in to our shower sessions. The Thrumming was doing whatever it could to get us to take one little peek. As awful as it sounds, it became the new normal. Linda and I became good at blocking any distractions, focusing on our shower thoughts more than anything else. We tried not to think about how much worse it could get, or how much longer we’d have to deal with it. Instead, our focus was on research, trying to see if anyone else had dealt with a situation like this. We were in the middle of looking for exorcists in our local area when my wife got a frantic call from her mother.

Apparently, Ruth got into an argument at a local restaurant. She decided to use some… choice words towards a young waitress, and what’s worse, this ‘interaction’ was recorded by several bystanders.

“Linda, I don’t feel safe in my own home anymore! The whole community has it out for me!” Her harpy screech tore through the phone's speaker.

I mimed playing the world’s smallest violin, grinning ear to ear. Linda glared daggers at me before speaking. “Well, Mom, I’m really sorry to hear that, but I don’t know what you want us to do about it.”

“Well, I just need to get away for a bit. Let this all blow over. You got a spare bedroom there, right?”

My smile was obliterated. I shook my head vehemently, mouthing “No no no no no no-”

“Mom, that’s asking a lot…”

“I know it is, dear, but listen. You still want to sell that house? Let me stay with you for a bit, and I promise, I’ll get that house back on the market for you, and get you as close to what you bought it for as possible.”

Linda and I stared at each other. I could tell we were on the same wavelength- *this could be it. If we let Ruth stay with us for a week or two, maybe she could even see what we’re dealing with. She could help get us out of here.*

“Alright, deal. Come on over, we’ll get the guest bedroom ready for you.”

In the time it took her to come over, we ran through the game plan multiple times on how we’d try to explain what’s going on in the house. We were as confident as we were going to be when we heard the knock on our door.

I opened the door for her. “Hey Ruth, come on in-”

She pushed me aside, her hands full of two suitcases, packed to the brim. “I haven’t eaten yet. Did you have dinner yet? Get a pot of coffee started for me.” She ordered, dropping her suitcases with a thud.

“Ruth, before all that, can we-”

“LINDA? Linda where-” she spotted Linda sitting in the conversation pit. “Oh, there you are. Get these suitcases unpacked for me, will you? It’s been such a rough day, I just want to eat, shower, and rest.”

Our eyes grew wide at the word *shower.*

“Mom, about that, can you come sit for a second? We need to talk to you about-”

“Yes, hun, we’ll have plenty of time to talk after I’ve eaten and freshened up-”

My wife rose from her seat and pointed at the chair next to her. “MOM. We need to talk NOW, or I'll throw your suitcases into the forest. Now SIT.” I’ve never heard her talk to her mother like that, but desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.

There was a moment where Ruth seemed stunned, before she resumed her normal, miserable demeanor.

“Alright, alright, dear. You don’t have to talk to me like that. I’m not a child. We’re all adults here.” She placed herself gingerly on the couch. I was biting my tongue so hard, I felt like I nearly tore it off.

Linda took the lead. “Mom, this house may be...haunted. Or cursed. We’re not quite sure. It doesn’t matter. Point is- there’s something bad with us here. We’ve been following some rules given to us by the previous owner, and it’s the only thing keeping us alive.” She pulled out the original note and handed it to Ruth, who was abnormally silent. Her eyes swept the small paper, line by line. Finally, she spoke.

“Do you take me for some sort of idiot?” She snarled, throwing the paper at Linda. “You have to make up some dumb monster because you’re too much of a coward to say you don’t want me here?”

“Ruth, enough-”

She wheeled her attention my way, pointing a finger at me. “Shut your mouth! It was probably *YOUR* idea, wasn’t it? You good for nothing waste of SPACE! The worst day of my life was the day you married Linda!” She couldn’t spew the vitriol fast enough from her mouth. She stood, fists balled, face red.

“Mom, enough! We’re telling the truth!” We both stood, watching her move with a purpose down the hallway.

“Yeah? I’ll be the judge of that! When nothing happens, I’ll be on my way, so you don’t have to deal with me ever again!” Rage echoed alongside her footsteps as she threw the bathroom door open.

“MOM, NO, WAIT!” Linda cried. I grabbed her before she could chase after her.

“Linda, no, we can’t go in there.” I held her in place, facing her away from the bathroom.

My gut lurched when I heard the shower turn on.

One Mississippi.

“Shut your eyes, Linda. Quick!” I tried to console her, as we both knew what was coming.

Two Mississippi.

Three Mississippi.

Ruth’s boisterous voice echoed from the small bathroom. “WHERE’S THE 'THUMBING', HUH? I DON’T SEE IT. IS IT SHY?”

Four Mississippi.

Five Mississippi.

I just held Linda in my arms, as she sobbed, already mourning the loss of her mother.

Six Mississippi.

Seven Mississippi.

I looked down the hall, into the bathroom, where Ruth stood yelling. A tiny part of me thought even someone like her didn’t deserve whatever was about to happen.

Eight Mississippi.

Nine Mississippi.

I turned and shut my eyes.

“YOU MAKE ME SICK, YOU UNGRATEFUL-”

Ten Mississippi.

Ruth’s rage-filled ramblings instantly became soul-piercing screams. I’ve never heard a human make those noises before. Shrieks of mortal terror so loud I could hear her vocal chords tearing, squelched by the gurgle of what I assumed was blood. Wet ripping sounds echoed down the hallway, punctuated by the heavy thud of something heavy hitting the ground. Linda and I sat in each other’s arms for some time before I began to crawl on my hands and knees towards the bathroom, eyes still shut. I needed to turn off the shower.

I could feel the transition from carpet to cold tile, and as I moved forward, a warm liquid coated my hands. I followed the noise of the running water, ignoring the reverberating hum in my head. My hands bumped into something on the floor, and I recoiled immediately, knowing exactly who I just made contact with. I awkwardly lifted myself up onto the edge of the tub and blindly groped the wall, finding the shower handle, and turning it off with a whining hiss. I waited in that room until The Thrumming was long gone. I won’t describe to you what was left of Ruth.

So, that’s where we are now. With all that’s just gone on, Linda and I have decided to put our only plan left in action, which is why I’m writing this. We weren’t looking for priests before Ruth arrived. We were planning this post. Whoever you are, you’re probably a good person, but Linda and I can’t handle this much longer, so I had to go with whoever reads this first. I’m sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me. It’s nothing personal.

So I’ve hidden a rule from you. Our guess is that maybe whatever this thing is, it may not be tied to the house. I think the only reason it’s stayed here is because the old couple before us never broke rule 5. It makes sense- had they broken rule 5 back in their day, the whole town would’ve come after them. The townspeople would’ve known who told them. But in this day and age, on the internet? Anonymity has its perks. So if my theory is correct, you might buy us some time, or maybe even make it leave us alone. In fairness, however, I want to give you the rules one more time. All of them.

Rule 1: From ten seconds after the shower is turned on until ten seconds after the shower is turned off, ***do not open your eyes.*** You need to keep your eyes closed, so you don’t see it. You’ll know when it’s watching you.

Rule 2: When showering, only one person should be in the bathroom. More people means more chances of someone breaking the rules.

Rule 3: When showering, keep the bathroom door locked, so no one accidentally walks in and sees it.

Rule 4: ***Ignore what it says to you.*** It will only get better at tempting you to open your eyes. Don’t.

Rule 5: Do not tell anyone about this thing. The secret needs to stay with you, in this house. Don't let it get out.",1,1756078915.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

1mzb2xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/1mzb2xp/a_purple_prose_on_meditation_and_thinking/,A Purple Prose on Meditation and Thinking,"I have been on a personal journey with meditation for around 4-5 years now, and I must say, as an overly emotional Gemini with hyperactive thoughts, it was a turbulent relationship, indeed. At the beginning I became overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of how many ""ways"" there were to meditate. Some say it should be an act of ""No-Thought"" in which the mind is simply silent. And whilst this method does have it's uses (Especially for the Mediums out there,) this method acted as a deterrent for me rather than an act of peace and balance.

The 'method' that stuck with me were those that spoke of connecting with your thoughts, rather than shutting them off. Following their flow, and understanding how to let go of them as they pass. On the outside, this sounded simple enough, especially as someone as emotionally involved as I am. Through years of emotional regulation, I have been able to connect quite quickly between my thoughts and emotion. I knew exactly what I was feeling, and why, and what to do in order to regulate it. It is worth nothing that the execution of said regulation wasn't done nearly as many times as it should have been; however, I have never had an issue UNDERSTANDING myself, or understanding the perspectives and emotions of others. That all being said, I didn't fully understand how to connect with the ""Flow-Style Meditation"" until recently and I would like to share that experience in the hopes that it can help you along your journey.

As I indicated earlier, I have an extremely loud mind. I could be attempting to work out all possible 'outcomes' of a situation, whilst having a conversation in my head about something else, whilst also performing a series of tasks and it was all just normal for me. ""The way it is."" Well, foundational meditation did teach me the premise of peace and as such, that skill will naturally develop. No matter how loud things can get, enough sitting around in silence will eventually get your mind to slow down if you focus on a point (breathing, a literal dot, a visual, etc.). That being said, for me this only got SO far. It slowed the thoughts down but they were still very here.

I break this down into Two Parts. **The Philosophy** and **The Practice**

**The Philosophy:**  
Whilst it wasn't my first experience with the rationale, it only recently cemented to me that every single point in time is truly important. There is no moment built from coincidence, but rather by the most extravagant and eldritch combinations of the Collective Will, Desire, and Belief. Each moment you have the opportunity to perceive, is a moment specifically designed for you to perceive it. To put it simply, treat each and every second with an equal amount of importance. Personally, I don't really believe this Understanding can be effectively performed until one has developed at least an Adept stage of self-understanding and attachment to Truth; that being, the reasonable and rational perception of the present moment. One has to be able to establish a concrete connection with the Self, in order to be able to Powers of what Is and what Isn't. The Hermetic Spectrum of Power.

For example, you are looking at a picture of a warm jazz bar. With an Understanding of how that picture makes you feel, you can attach yourself to that photo and simulate the senses in a way that connect you with the Power of that picture effectively making you ""There;"" however, at no point in time is your physical body in that warm jazz bar and as such, you should not attempt to use your monitor as a coffee maker and be upset that it doesn't work. One is the Power of Belief, the other is Delusion.

**The Practice**  
When you meditate, it can be very difficult to realize when you've had 'enough' of a thought. When it goes from being a moment of Understanding (i.e. a Message or Lesson), to mental masturbation. At some point, you must move forward in the event another message or lesson is brought your way. In order to do this, you must be able to distinguish the fine line between your Logos, and your Ego. This is more difficult than you'd think because your Logos (from my perspective) is the series of symbols closely and uniquely attuned to you that is used by the In-Human to communicate the most effectively.

The series of symbols that are attuned to you, are reflected on the Ego itself. They have a symbiotic relationship. Your personal perception of All (Ego) generates the alphabet (Logos) for which the Universe uses to send you messages. Between those two places, exists a line in which you are beginning to create your own messages, this is when Ego trumps Logos, and begets Delusion. This is when being very comfortable and accepting of your emotions and thoughts allows this practice to flow much smoother. If you are using an inspiration to base your Visualizations off of (Ego), that is fine! But be able to discern where your Constructions begin (the cool dragon you've suddenly mounted because it's rad) as it will distract you from the message attempting to be sent by the Logos.

Be strict with your mind when you need to be. Allow it to turn, for that is the force used to empower the Logos, simply watch for how much power you allow so that it acts alongside Ego in congruence.

Now the reason I am writing this post is because I saw a video on Instagram about a guy that was asked what he is haunted by most in life. He confessed that he ghosted a girl after seven months of a relationship. No goodbye text, no nothing. And to this day he still hasn’t apologised to her. Other people around him didn’t take kindly to it. Long story short, it reminded me of something similar I did to a girl about 12 years ago. 

At the time I was 20 and now I am 32 and honestly I still have a hard time accepting and moving on from what I did to the kindest sweetest and most loving person(32F) I have ever met in my life. At the time we both knew each other from high school and I was studying abroad and I was home for summer vacation she asked me out on a coffee date basically. Now I knew that she always harboured a crush on me throughout high school but me being a giant jackass and dumbass at the time didn’t feel attracted to her because of how crooked her teeth were. Anyway, we got close during that date and we kissed and I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, and as soon as she said yes I regretted it instantly. Like I literally asked myself that very moment “you moron, what did you just do?”. I basically listened to my raging hormones instead of being rational. Anyway, a month went by and we didn’t communicate too much, actually I didn’t communicate too much and I felt ashamed and guilty and just couldn’t look her in the eye and I just knew I needed to break up with because giving false hope and ghosting someone, especially as sweet and caring as her never deserved such treatment. We broke up because I felt it was the right thing to do and I hated myself and deeply felt ashamed and regret for having hurt someone like that. What was perplexing to me was how she was able to forgive me something henious, stating that she knew what kind of person I was and that could hold that against me, something I don’t think I even deserve, because what I did was unforgivable yet she had the strength to do it.


Since then I have come to realise that I always prefer someone break my heart instead of me breaking somebody else’s, because at the very least with the former I know how to handle the situation. With the latter to this day I don’t know how to handle it.

A year has passed after that and she contacted me again wishing to see me, what I have come to realise was that she was hoping that we would get back together. I of course refused. A decision I still deeply regret to this day.

Now, she has found an amazing husband and she even has two children, two boys with them. And all I can say is that her husband probably has to be the luckiest man alive. 

I have had three relationships after that, each ending messier than the last. But my very last that nearly broke me, taught me something important and reminded that the most important thing for me is someone who is loving, supportive, kind, caring and understanding person and a girl that will bring me peace.

At the time I regretted hurting that girl, now I regret losing her because after my last breakup I learned what kind of person I want to be with and what kind of man I actually want to become. Hopefully one day I will find a girl even a fraction of what this girl that I  hurt so bad was.

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

No, like, did I miss a day in school where they told us about this?! Because somehow people are earning sweet side cash as “beta testers,” and I just… opened Instagram for a living?

At first, I was super confused. Can random, non-tech people ACTUALLY just… sign up and get paid to try out apps and tell someone what they think? Isn’t that supposed to be, like, complicated?

But then—out of nowhere—someone drops me this **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** link and suddenly I’m face-to-screen with a signup that took a literal minute!

Here’s what’s melting my brain: you DON’T NEED *any* experience, coding skills, or fancy credentials to start testing apps for cash.

Let me shock you with what I learned:

- The demand is INSANE. Apps need “normal person” feedback (uh, hello, that’s us) before risking a buggy launch.
- Signups take MINUTES and payments are real. We’re talking direct transfer, gift cards—stuff you actually want.
- It’s flexible, chill side-cash income. Sometimes, just downloading or using an app nets you rewards or cash!

But here’s where it gets wild:
- They want FRESH perspectives. That means you being a total newbie is actually your superpower.
- Every device counts: Android, iPhone, even old tablets lurking in your junk drawer.
- Work-from-anywhere. Seriously, your couch and snacks qualify as a workspace now.

And the #1 cheat code? Keep checking **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** for new beta opportunities, because apps are launching NONSTOP.

Nervous? So was I. First time I did it I triple-checked my bank account because I didn’t trust money could be this easy! But you know what? It was THERE. (Confused and slightly suspicious, TBH.)

If you can:
- Fill out a form online,
- Download an app,
- Poke around and say what you liked/hated (no filter needed),

You can be a paid tester. I wish I could go back and grab myself before I paid for my last coffee—and say: “Hey, just try **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** now and let someone literally PAY you to tap on your phone instead!”

Shocking, but also the most obvious thing in retrospect. Companies PAY to avoid disaster launches. We’re just the missing puzzle piece!

Snapshot how your first test goes (it’s weirdly exciting to point out app mistakes).

Has anyone else been living under a rock, or is beta testing the hidden hack for blending lazy + productive?

TL;DR:
Confused. Hyped. A little bit suspicious but also richer this week.  
Try it—the worst-case scenario is a fatter Venmo and a new obsession.  
Don’t forget the magic portal: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**!

Every time I use it, I get this rush of excitement, and it’s like unlocking a brand new superpower for my brain. Whether I’m brainstorming ideas for a side project or need quick advice on what to cook with three random ingredients, ChatGPT steps up like a digital genie.

Let’s break it down...

- Need writing inspiration? 💡 Done. ChatGPT spits out ideas I never would’ve considered.
- Feeling stuck while learning something new? It explains like the world’s chillest tutor.
- Got a weird, midnight “what if?” shower thought? Instant, thoughtful conversation partner.

One of my favorite things is just seeing how much it *gets* my vibe. I’ll ramble about a wild startup idea, and in return, I’ll get a mock pitch deck or a brand slogan that’s honestly better than coffee for my motivation.

ChatGPT isn’t just a digital assistant—it’s becoming a collaborator, a creative partner, and sometimes, a pleasant surprise generator.

How cool is it that:

- Writers can speed past dreaded blank-page syndrome.
- Coders debug with a helpful (and endlessly patient!) AI buddy.
- Even artists and musicians are using it as their sounding board.

And I have to say, watching GPT evolve has been like watching a favorite TV series level up each season. New features drop, and suddenly the sky’s the limit:

- Plugins, custom instructions, browsing tools – each update feels like “DLC” for your creativity.
- Multi-modal support means we aren’t just texting anymore—we’re making images, code, whole stories.
- Communities (like ours!) pop up and get inspired together.

Sometimes I just sit and think about all the things we’re going to build next, and how this technology is helping people with accessibility, expression, and even just pure fun.

But the very best part?

We get to be the pioneers—poking and prodding, mixing and matching, just plain *playing* with ChatGPT.

So, what’s your latest “wow, ChatGPT is awesome!” moment? Any fun uses or unexpected “aha!” events? Let’s spread some of that AI joy and swap stories! 🤩",1,1756078133.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False
1mzaws1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mzaws1/should_i_pursue_a_relationship_with_a_guym20_that/,Should I pursue a relationship with a guy(M20) that I (F20) am seeing and most likely getting serious with?,"Before I start, I would like to state that I really enjoy seeing and getting to know this man. I just need some clarification and outside opinions, as I try to tell this as unbiased as possible, I am not looking for extreme solutions right now. 

For context, I met a guy this summer (P) around May, and we hit it off pretty well as friends. We were 3 hours away, but attended the same school and were going to be in the same town once school was in session. Because of the distance, we took things a little slow and waited about 5 weeks to meet. During this time, he was very attentive, caring, and fun to talk to (and still is), basically all green flags. We immediately clicked in person and started seeing each other back and forth, I would say around 5-6 times for the rest of the summer until we officially moved back to our college town last week, where we now can easily see each other more often.

Now here is the issue. It has clearly been established as exclusive and definitely more serious, as we have both communicated that we do not want to waste each other's time. We have discussed values and future plans, which seem to be all pretty similar too. We have met each other's friends, all of whom we both get along with. We have met each other's families as well, but not fully, just by coincidence. I feel like we are moving in the right direction. We both have had serious relationships before, so we both have a pretty good idea of what we are doing as well.

I am a little upset, though, and please tell me if I am overthinking, but I feel like we are now at a point after 2-ish months where I feel ready to put a label on things. Because of the long distance, P and I have never had time to plan an ""official"" date since our time together is usually short. I am giving him the benefit of the doubt because it has only been a week, but I feel as if it would be appropriate to ask soon. Don't get me wrong, we've had small dates or hangouts (which to me is equally as valuable and fun) and he has paid for me for some and treated me as someone he is going out with in public, though these are just simple things like grabbing brunch, coffee, or spending the day together (I am not complaining and I genuinely enjoy those days), but he has mentioned multiple times he wants to take me on a nice date which I assume means more detailed planning and being more ""romantic"".  My friends think he is waiting for this moment to ask me to be official, which is definitely the case, I feel, but sometimes I think my mind gets the best of me and wonder if it's just all talk.

I do not want to self-sabotage, and he has reassured me he has not forgotten about our date and is just waiting to get paid from work (totally understandable), but I guess what I am wondering is, how long is too long? I feel like we are both at a point where we are ready, and personally, I feel as if he has had lots of opportunities, but also, I know it's ok to be patient and just enjoy where things are at. I just don't want it to get to a point where he is getting the benefits of the relationship without the actual commitment.  

Please let me know if I'm overthinking. I haven't had the best experiences with relationships in the past, so it is hard for me to identify healthy patterns. I have never taken my worries out on him and never will, but I just want to know if things are on the right path, or if I am wasting my time. My plan was, if no progress is made in the next couple of weeks, to communicate and ask where we see things going. I have given him my work schedule, and we have compared our day-to-day schedules, so the ball is in his court. Let me know what you think, and please be nice. I am not angry or resentful; I just genuinely don't really know how these things work.

1mzauni,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mzauni/every_beginner_mistake_i_made_with_ai_video_and/,Every beginner mistake i made with AI video (and how to avoid the $2000 learning curve),"this is 1going to save you months of expensive trial and error if you’re just starting with AI video generation…

Made literally every mistake possible when I started with veo3. Burned through $2000+ learning what NOT to do before figuring out what actually works.

**Here are the biggest mistakes that cost me the most money and time:**

# Mistake #1: Perfectionist single-shot approach

## **What I did wrong:**

Spent hours crafting the “perfect prompt” then generated once, expecting perfection.

## **Why this fails:**

AI video is inherently unpredictable. Same prompt under slightly different conditions produces completely different results.

## **What works instead:**

Generate 8-12 variations of same concept, then select the best one. Hit rate goes from 10% to 70%.

## **Cost impact:**

- Wrong way: $50+ per usable video
- Right way: $15-20 per usable video

# Mistake #2: Fighting the AI aesthetic

## **What I did wrong:**

Tried to make AI video look perfectly realistic and human. Added tons of post-processing effects thinking it would “fix” the AI look.

## **Why this fails:**

Uncanny valley is real. Almost-realistic-but-not-quite looks creepy and performs poorly.

## **What works instead:**

Embrace beautiful impossibility. Create content that’s obviously AI but visually stunning. Audiences prefer honest AI creativity over fake realism.

## **Quality impact:**

- Fighting AI aesthetic: Creepy, unengaging content
- Embracing AI aesthetic: Beautiful, shareable content

# Mistake #3: Random prompt construction

## **What I did wrong:**

Wrote prompts like essays with every adjective I could think of. “A beautiful cinematic high-quality masterpiece professional stunning gorgeous…”

## **Why this fails:**

AI models ignore filler words. More words ≠ better results.

## **What works instead:**

Structured prompting: [SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO]

## **Example comparison:**

- **Bad**: “A beautiful woman walking through a stunning cinematic cityscape with amazing lighting and professional quality”
- **Good**: “Medium shot, woman in red dress, confident stride, neon-lit street, tracking shot, Audio: heels on pavement”

# Mistake #4: Ignoring audio elements completely

## **What I did wrong:**

Never included audio cues in prompts. Focused only on visual elements.

## **Why this fails:**

Audio context makes AI video feel exponentially more realistic and engaging.

## **What works instead:**

Always include audio elements: “Audio: keyboard clicking, distant traffic, coffee shop ambience”

## **Engagement impact:**

- No audio cues: Feels artificial, low engagement
- With audio cues: Feels real, high engagement

# Mistake #5: Complex camera movements

## **What I did wrong:**

Asked for “pan while zooming during dolly movement with handheld shake”

## **Why this fails:**

AI gets confused trying to execute multiple movements simultaneously. Results in chaotic, unusable footage.

## **What works instead:**

One clear camera instruction: “Slow dolly forward” or “Orbital around subject” or “Static camera”

## **Quality difference:**

- Complex movements: Chaotic, nauseating footage
- Simple movements: Professional, clean execution

# Mistake #6: Using Google’s direct pricing for learning

## **What I did wrong:**

Paid Google’s full $0.50/second pricing while learning through iteration.

## **Cost reality:**

- Learning requires volume testing
- Google’s pricing: $30+ per minute of content
- Factor in failed attempts: $150+ per usable video
- Monthly learning budget: $3000+

## **What I discovered:**

Companies offer veo3 access at 60-70% below Google’s rates. Been using veo3gen[.]app for 4 months now - same quality, dramatically lower cost.

## **Budget impact:**

- Google direct: $3000/month learning budget
- Cost-optimized access: $800/month for same volume

# Mistake #7: One-size-fits-all platform approach

## **What I did wrong:**

Created one video and posted same version across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube.

## **Why this fails:**

Each platform has different algorithms, audience expectations, and optimal formats.

## **What works instead:**

Create platform-specific versions from the start:
- TikTok: High energy, 15-30 seconds
- Instagram: Visual perfection, smooth flow
- YouTube: Educational value, professional quality

## **Performance difference:**

- Same content everywhere: 500-2000 views typical
- Platform-optimized content: 10K-100K+ views possible

# Mistake #8: Vague style references

## **What I did wrong:**

Used generic terms like “cinematic,” “professional,” “high quality”

## **Why this fails:**

AI needs specific technical direction, not subjective adjectives.

## **What works instead:**

Specific references: “Shot on Arri Alexa,” “Blade Runner 2049 cinematography,” “Teal and orange color grade”

## **Consistency improvement:**

- Vague terms: Unpredictable, inconsistent results
- Specific references: Reliable, repeatable quality

# Mistake #9: Random seed usage

## **What I did wrong:**

Used completely random seeds (like 47382, 91847) hoping for luck.

## **Why this fails:**

No learning between generations, no quality patterns, expensive guessing.

## **What works instead:**

Systematic seed bracketing: Test seeds 1000-1010, find patterns, build seed library for different content types.

## **Efficiency gain:**

- Random seeds: 20+ attempts for good result
- Systematic seeds: 5-8 attempts for good result

# Mistake #10: Stopping at first “good enough” result

## **What I did wrong:**

Generated until I got something “acceptable” then stopped.

## **Why this fails:**

“Good enough” content doesn’t go viral. Need exceptional content for social media success.

## **What works instead:**

Generate until you get something genuinely exciting, not just acceptable. Volume approach enables selection of genuinely great content.

## **Viral potential difference:**

- “Good enough” content: 100-1000 views typical
- Exceptional content: 10K-100K+ views possible

# The expensive learning pattern:

**Month 1**: $800 spent, mostly failures

**Month 2**: $600 spent, some usable content
**Month 3**: $400 spent, decent success rate
**Month 4**: $300 spent, systematic approach working

**Total learning curve cost: $2100+**

# What I wish someone told me on day 1:

1. **AI video is about systematic iteration, not creative perfection**
2. **Embrace AI aesthetic instead of fighting it**
3. **Structure beats randomness in every aspect**
4. **Platform optimization is more important than content quality**
5. **Cost optimization enables learning through volume**
6. **Audio elements are criminally underused**
7. **Simple camera movements beat complex combinations**
8. **Specific references beat vague descriptors**
9. **Systematic seeds beat random guessing**
10. **Exceptional beats “good enough” for viral potential**

# The systematic beginner workflow:

## **Week 1**: Learn prompt structure, test basic concepts

## **Week 2**: Experiment with seed bracketing, build quality patterns

## **Week 3**: Test platform-specific optimization

## **Week 4**: Focus on selection over perfection, aim for exceptional content

**This approach cuts learning curve from 6 months to 1 month.**

# Red flags that indicate you’re making these mistakes:

- Spending $100+ per finished video
- Getting frustrated with inconsistent results
- Trying to make AI look perfectly human
- Using same content across all platforms
- Random generation without learning patterns

**If any of these apply, step back and optimize your approach systematically.**

these mistakes cost me months of time and thousands of dollars. sharing them hoping to save others from the same expensive learning curve.

what beginner mistakes did you make with AI video? curious what expensive lessons others have learned

hope this helps someone avoid the random trial-and-error phase <3",3,1756077887.0,PromptEngineering,1,0.72,False

1mzasfc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzasfc,31M Single - Open concept living room/dining room,"TL;DR @ bottom

I moved in 1.5 years ago but spent about 6 months traveling abroad almost right at the start of my agreement - previously had a place that was a studio apartment but it was the definition of minimalist bachelor (bed, gaming pc desk setup, dressers)

I’ve been here 7.5 months and so far this is what I’ve come up with as my general use living room/hosting space 

The recliner is typically sitting on the left side of the palm pattern area rug near the rock band drum kit - that orientation allows me to lounge and watch tv at the perfect angle as my tv mount is full motion. I don’t have to adjust the mount much though, a simple and gentle tip to wall turn allows the perfect range of motion for the optimal viewing experience when in the recliner

I have a set of Adam audio studio speakers for when I want to kick up the tunes and jam out or really make full use of an immersive home theater - the speakers use a bluetooth connection as well so you could pair not just with the tv but also a phone - if you upgraded the set up a bit more to include a dedicated studio & mixer modality then you’d get much better use haha but I quite enjoy their place in my set up so far

Most of my lighting and smaller decor details are from a move out sale - the coffee table that’s on sliders is an offer up find (Japanese carved wood) - random assortment of pillows/cushions & Pokémon I’ve picked up over the years - blankets are from target - green futon is from Amazon (millennial green couch)

My tv is a Hisense 4K google tv (65”) - I know I’m guilty of having the tv mounted too high - originally it was meant to leave enough access under the tv to keep the placement of my switch dock placement viable, partly cover the top of my Xbox series x, as well as not obstruct the view of my dogs ashes & paw print (she passed from cancer)

- the whole set up from the fireplace up is powered via a Monster Cables outlet hub w/ 3’ cable, 10 outlets and 2 usb ports that are nestled into an additional 3’ extension dock - bulbs in everything are Hubspace app compatible so I can control lighting temp & brightness as well as full spectrum color wheel

There is a pending set of lego projects I haven’t gotten to (orchid and great wave) but I do plan for those to be completed sooner than later 

———

Opposite the living room I have a fully stocked entertainment display filled with movies, games, cd’s & specialty alcohol either from my travels over the past decade or gifted spirits from friends also from travels 

Dining table I acquired when I moved into my first apartment at 20yo and it’s been with me since - might be time for a cohesive upgrade as the chairs that came with the table were already trashed when I bought the table so it’s always been more of a launch & landing pad, sort of how people use use credenza’s at/near the entry

- the biggest complaint I’ve gotten from guests be it family, friends or the occasional dinner party is my seating space/availability - so I know the best solution would be to invest in a whole new diner set to make the best use of the space - the current table might end up serving its current purpose as a designated drop zone but perhaps in the back patio or as “counter space/island” in my kitchen - it’s currently on a slider pad that would allow easy maneuvering while providing full support and no wobbles/shakes

———

I also own a fair amount of art I’ve collected over the past decade also from traveling, art museums, galleries, self made charcoal canvases, drawings, posters, and photographs - I would love to get more of that stuff up on the walls but I can never seem to get around to buying frames for things 😅 maybe that’s my red flag haha

I do however have a world map “framed” with lanyards from the music festivals/raves I’ve been to over the years and all the places I’ve visited/spent time in either scratched off/exposed or outlined, places where the people I’ve met on my travels live, and at times I’ll space off as my eyes wander the lines that outline each country, denote major cities and give sense to the scale of humanity

- not to get off base but traveling & exploring different parts of the world and interacting with its people, learning bits of their languages so I can communicate better and exist in peace has been among my greatest life lessons

———

TL;DR - 31M - Single - looking for general advice, my home is shoe free/no shoes -  need advice or feedback on the current layout of my living/dining room - use is combo single male living space & hosting space (up to 15 people capacity - not counting kitchen, back patio/garden) also if there’s any advice related to a good quality dining set that can double as a launch zone that would be appreciated 🫱🏼‍🫲🏻 ",0,1756077725.0,malelivingspace,0,0.5,False

If you're looking for a book that will absolutely mess with your head in the best possible way, you might want to check this one out. It’s a total ride, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all, like we're just chatting over coffee.

### What's It All About? (No Spoilers, Promise!)

Okay, so imagine a high school, a new teacher, and a student who just can't seem to stay out of trouble. But this isn't your average teacher-student drama. **The Teacher** dives deep into a twisted web of secrets, obsession, and mind games that will have you second-guessing *everyone* and *everything*. Just when you think you've got it figured out, McFadden pulls the rug right out from under you. It’s got all the classic McFadden elements: short chapters, a fast pace, and those signature jaw-dropping twists that make you gasp out loud.

***

### What I Really Liked

Honestly, the biggest draw for me was the pacing. This book moves! You zip from one chapter to the next, always wanting to know what happens next. It’s like a really addictive TV show that you just can’t stop binge-watching. The writing style is super accessible and straightforward, which makes it easy to just get lost in the story.

The characters, especially the main ones, are just fantastic. They’re complex, flawed, and you never quite know who to trust. I spent most of the book swinging between liking someone, then hating them, then feeling sorry for them. That's a sign of a good thriller character, right? You get really invested in their messed-up lives, and the emotions range from intense suspense to outright shock. McFadden is a master at building that kind of tension.

### What Might Not Be for Everyone (My Honest Thoughts)

While I loved the twists, there were a couple of moments where I thought, ""Wait, really?"" Sometimes the sheer number of revelations can feel a little over the top, almost like a puzzle with too many pieces. It's not a deal-breaker at all, but if you prefer your thrillers to be super grounded in reality, some of the twists might stretch your imagination a bit. Also, if you've read a lot of McFadden's books, some elements might feel a *tiny* bit familiar, but she still manages to make it fresh.

### So, Would I Recommend It?

Absolutely, yes! If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, especially those with unreliable narrators and shocking endings, you need to pick up **The Teacher By Freida McFadden**. It's a perfect book for anyone who loves a quick, addictive read that keeps you guessing until the very last page. If you enjoyed books like *The Housemaid* or *The Locked Door*, you'll definitely be in for a treat here.

### A Little Guide for New Readers (Or New Thriller Fans!)

If you're new to reading thrillers, or maybe new to reading in general, and this book sounds intriguing, here are a few tips from one reader to another:

1.  **Embrace the Ride:** Don't try too hard to figure out the ending. Part of the fun of a thriller like **The Teacher** is letting the author lead you down every unexpected path. Just enjoy the suspense!
2.  **Find Your Quiet Corner:** Thrillers are best enjoyed when you can really focus. Find a comfy spot where you won't be interrupted and just dive in.
3.  **It's Okay to Take Breaks:** If things get too intense (and they will!), it's totally fine to put the book down for a bit. Come back to it when you're ready.
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Highlight or Jot Down Thoughts:** If a character's motive confuses you or a detail seems important, make a mental note, or even a real one! It can be fun to look back later.
5.  **Talk About It!** Reading can be a really personal experience, but sharing your thoughts with friends or online (like we're doing now!) can make it even more enjoyable.

Reading is an amazing journey, and every book is a new adventure. Don't feel pressured to love every single book you pick up. The most important thing is to keep exploring and find what truly excites you.

So I went on one date with this guy last Wednesday who I met on Hinge and on paper we are so compatible. Similar world views. We both are left leaning politically, not religious, and not interested in having kids. Being from Texas its so hard to find dudes like that and I have a huge crush on this guy. The coffee date was fun and we both enjoyed the conversation!

So here is where the confusion starts. So I drove back home and was the one to text him first. \*I\* told him that I had a good time and asked if he made it home okay. He responded an hour later and said that he made it home and had fun too. Then once again \*I\* asked him if he wanted to meet again. And he said yes he did the next day in the afternoon.

He had a vasectomy scheduled for this Friday and he said ""Yes I wanna meet again. Lets figure something out after my big surgery and see how im doing lol"". Then the same day (Thursday) I responded with ""Okay! Take care of yourself. Lets meet up once you have recovered"". And its Sunday now and still no response.... Is he not interested anymore? Would it be too much if I ask how his recovery is going? The 3 days of no response has me a bit confused ngl. But since I sent the last message, I don't feel like double texting.

TL;DR Went on a promising date with a guy and he has not responded since his outpatient surgery. Confused on his intentions now.",1,1756077367.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Used to approach AI video creation randomly. Generate something, post it, hope for the best. No system, no consistency, terrible results.

**Built this systematic workflow over 6 months and now content creation is predictable and scalable.**

# The weekly workflow structure:

## **Monday: Analysis & Planning (2 hours)**

- Analyze previous week’s performance across all platforms
- Identify top-performing content themes and techniques
- Research trending topics in AI and creative communities
- Plan 15-20 concepts for upcoming week
- Update successful prompt/seed libraries

## **Tuesday-Wednesday: Batch Generation (6 hours total)**

- Generate 3-5 variations for each planned concept
- Focus on volume over perfection in generation phase
- Test different seeds, camera angles, style references
- Organize raw footage by concept and quality level
- Initial culling - eliminate obviously failed generations

## **Thursday: Selection & Optimization (4 hours)**

- Select best 1-2 generations from each concept batch
- Create platform-specific versions (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube)
- Add final touches, timing adjustments, quality checks
- Prepare thumbnails and covers for each platform
- Write captions and hashtag strategies

## **Friday: Content Finalization (2 hours)**

- Final quality review and approval process
- Schedule content for optimal posting times
- Prepare cross-platform promotion strategy
- Update tracking spreadsheets with concept details
- Plan follow-up content for successful pieces

# Daily generation workflow (Tuesday-Wednesday):

## **Morning session (3 hours):**

- **Hour 1**: Cyberpunk/tech content generation
- **Hour 2**: Lifestyle/aspirational content generation
- **Hour 3**: Action/dynamic content generation

## **Afternoon session (3 hours):**

- **Hour 1**: Product/commercial content generation
- **Hour 2**: Artistic/creative content generation
- **Hour 3**: Educational/tutorial content generation

**Batching by content type maintains creative consistency and technical efficiency.**

# Content multiplication strategy:

## **One concept becomes multiple variations:**

**Example - “Person working late at night” concept:**

1. **Cyberpunk version**: Neon lighting, futuristic setup, electronic audio
2. **Cozy version**: Warm lighting, coffee cup, ambient sounds
3. **Professional version**: Clean office, natural lighting, business audio
4. **Artistic version**: Dramatic lighting, creative angles, atmospheric audio

**4 different videos from 1 core concept.**

## **Platform-specific adaptation:**

Each variation gets optimized for:
- **TikTok**: 15-20 seconds, high energy, trending audio compatibility

- **Instagram**: 25-30 seconds, aesthetic perfection, smooth flow
- **YouTube**: 45-60 seconds, educational value, professional quality

**12 total videos from 1 original concept.**

# Technical workflow optimization:

## **Prompt template system:**

Pre-built templates for different content categories:

```
Portrait template: Close-up + [subject] + [emotion] + [style] + [camera] + [audio]
Action template: Wide shot + [character] + [movement] + [energy] + [tracking] + [dynamic audio]
Product template: Macro + [item] + [reveal] + [commercial] + [orbital] + [relevant audio]
```

## **Seed library organization:**

Categorized successful seeds:

```
Tech content seeds: 1002, 1007, 2156, 3089
Lifestyle seeds: 1334, 1445, 2223, 3156
Action seeds: 2047, 2334, 2889, 3223
```

**Eliminates random guessing, ensures quality consistency.**

## **Style reference database:**

Organized successful combinations:

```
Cyberpunk: ""Blade Runner cinematography"" + purple/blue grade
Lifestyle: ""Shot on iPhone 15 Pro"" + golden hour lighting
Professional: ""Shot on Arri Alexa"" + teal and orange grade
```

# Cost optimization workflow:

## **Generation budget allocation:**

- 40% - New concept testing
- 35% - Successful concept variations
- 25% - Platform optimization versions

## **Quality vs quantity balance:**

- Generate 5-8 variations per concept
- Select best 1-2 for development
- Create 3 platform versions of winners

**Cost per finished video: $15-25 through systematic approach**

Been using veo3gen[.]app for workflow optimization since Google’s direct pricing makes systematic batch generation cost-prohibitive. 70% cost reduction enables volume-based quality approach.

# Performance tracking system:

1mzaj09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mzaj09/15_g_of_creatine_daily_has_changed_my_life/,15 g of creatine daily has changed my life,"Background: 28M, middle-school teacher, suffered from chronic fatigue/ loss in cognition speed caused by long COVID from an infection two years ago almost to the date. I don't use caffeine.

I began taking creatine 9 months ago as part of an effort to regain physical strength and mental stamina. At this point, I would be tired no matter if I slept 6 hours or 10 hours. In fact, last summer I slept 10-11 hours most days and still was rarely refreshed. My symptoms were largely improved from baseline, but I was doing my best to eradicate them.

I started at 5 g/day. Noticed benefits in terms of strength and stamina (I could hit a workout after work and not feel like Sisyphus). Didn't really notice any mental benefits.

Fast forward to three weeks ago. I started back the school year and had heard about higher doses of creatine being beneficial for cognition. I started taking 15 g/day and immediately could see a difference in cognition. Before COVID my brain worked very quickly, but afterwards it was noticeably slower and I had a bit of a stutter—something I've never suffered with in my life. These issues had gotten better over time, but 15 g/day has almost eradicated them. Instead of writing a paragraph over the benefits, I'm just going to list them.

* I have much more patience dealing with students.

* I have significantly more mental energy throughout the day despite teaching one class more than I usually teach.

* I am able to handle all the extraneous tasks of being a teacher with significantly more ease, even though I have a few more responsibilities this year compared to last year.

* The idea of having to perform small tasks, like sending an email, does not exhaust me.

* I no longer feel like I have to lie down when I get home from work. In fact, I have energy to come home and immediately do whatever needs to be done in my personal life (this was definitely not the case the last two years).

* My brain works much quicker—almost as quick as it did pre-COVID.

* My very mild stutter is 98% gone.

* I have no way of definitively tying this one to creatine, but my Apple Watch is showing increased deep sleep starting a couple days after I began my increased creatine consumption. I am genetically disposed towards longer deep sleep, but long-COVID seemed to have impacted it hard. I would average 50 mins–1 hour. The past couple weeks (on days I didn't intentionally stay up very late) I have hit around 1 hour 15 mins, and last night I hit 1 hour 40 mins. I have also noticed that I am having more incidents of deep sleep periods later in the night as well as early in the night, whereas before they were almost always isolated to the first two hours of sleep. I know sleep tracking isn't totally accurate at all, and Apple Watch does have a problem with under-reporting deep sleep, so take this one with a grain of salt.

* Speaking of sleep, I can function much better on shorter periods of sleep. It seems to have reduced my sleep need a little bit.

* Niche: My aim in Counter-Strike is godlike even on very tiring days. Before, it would be highly correlated with how tired I was. Yes, I do use this as a serious metric.

* I seem to get going in the mornings quicker. I wake up at 5:30 AM on weekdays, which is still brutal but I can handle it much more.

I've experienced no side effects save for slight hair thinning when I originally began taking 5 g/day. Yes, I know all about the studies but I also know what I felt when running my fingers through my hair. Thankfully, it seems to have stabilized and recovered mostly. No bloating, no water retention, no diarrhea, nothing. I get plenty of hydration daily: 4 cups of decaf green tea, 4 cups decaf coffee, one cup electrolytes in the morning.",69,1756077033.0,Supplements,56,0.96,False

""Everybody was happy and in the mood to celebrate. They finally started opening cases of one and everybody celebrated their first encounter.""

He started playing romantic songs on his Harp

""When you mix couples and add alcohol and celebrations certain things are bound to happen. Bow shiky Bow Wow "" everybody  laughed

""After leaving the bear planet and about 1 month into faster than light many women started reporting being nauseated. After being checked by the doctors it was quickly discovered that on every ship woman were pregnant. The only time this proved to be an issue who was when five women recorded the same man as a possible father. Tests would be confirmed later that in fact this French Canadian had probably set a record in one month. And the five woman decided to be in a polyamorous relationship. 6 shelter homes would be attached making it a very big home. Between all the ships 948 pregnancies were recorded.

Parliament was held two weeks after the pregnancy. It was decided at that assembly that when they came out of faster than light and four and a half months they will try harder to make this their final stop and start settling. 

Many months later they slow down and came out all faster than light. 

Once again this spacecraft came out of their motherships. They would start finding out in the house circle away from the direction of Earth while one Scout craft would start searching this area. 

Playing soft space music ""as it turned out the 6th planet the investigated all primary scans showed no large animals (scary music) no alien population (strange music) but quite livable conditions. 

This planet did not seem to have large oceans but many lakes and rivers all over the planet. Some of the lakes resembled the great lakes in North America. Scientist landed all over the planet conducting experiments on water, trees, plants and Earth. 

After receiving notification from most of these Scout ships that they had also found habitable planets it was decided that the first they had found would be named Paris.  (Start playing French music)

Once colonizing ship 20'000 strong was going to colonize this planet. A permanent Parliament and all associated administration buildings would also be built in Paris. The colonizers of Paris did not just come from France as each ship add colonizers from the entire world.

 The other colonizing ships were allowed to descend on the planet to stretch their legs and help build the first colony.

The scientists would be busy for many months to come examining all possible new planets.""

I went to breakfast this morning and a road closure forced us to go by his house. I looked over, knowing damn well what I would see. Her car parked where mine used to be. Sunday morning was always something I loved, he would go buy me a doughnut or something sweet, have coffee then we would go on a drive. His truck was gone so they were on the drive. One month since the break up, no contact from either one.

Im a big cranberry fan, aiming for something fresh and fruity, (pumpkin and apple notes are fine too since this is fall scents) but also maybe something with spices like nutmeg/ cinnamon/ bergamont.

Standard woodsy scents are okay too, but not neccessary

Usually im a pretty big fan of Replica (Beach Walk is my everyday) but Autumn Vibes is only meh, and I dont care for Jazz Club/ Fireplace/ Coffee. I usually always dislike gourmand/ coffee/ chocolate scents and that seems like a vast majority of the standard fall scents. Hopefully yall have some suggustions!

Upgrading from the Breville Barista Pro. Now that I have my grinder, Mazzer Philios, I want my quality, future, elegant espresso machine.
I drink 2 flat whites or cappuccinos a day and still trying to convince the wife to drink a latte or two, although currently she prefers my mocha pot with a ton almond milk. 
I pretty much convinced myself on the Profitec Pro 600, but then saw the Ride (successor) has all the new features, pre infusions, fast warm up time, ton of programmables so I didn’t want to be so behind on the tech if I have the machine for the next 10+ years. But then I’ve been seeing people having leaks, issues already with the Ride and also don’t love the look that Profitec is going towards. I love the classic shiny steel look
Then I stumbled into the ECM Mechanicka Max and I love this machine. I know it’s not a DB and it will make some people here mad, but not sure I really actually need one? Plus this is the most advanced HX yet as the PiD check temps at the boiler and the group head to my understanding. It’s packed with features, has a rotary pump and it’s absolutely gorgeous to me, so talk me out of it? ",1,1756076907.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

2 days ago i really thought i found someone who could love me like i need and even though i really want it i would rather die than text her twice and look desperate. everything will end in mutual ghosting and i hope i die because i clearly can't move on from anything ever.

Instead of just guessing (or lying to myself 😅), I started taking photos of what I drink throughout the day and having AI break it down into actual caffeine mg. The results have been eye-opening. I found out my “light coffee days” were actually closer to 250–300mg.

What’s cool is I can now see patterns:
	•	Under ~60mg = I’m sluggish in the morning.
	•	100–150mg = ideal focus zone.
	•	Anything above 250mg = guaranteed crash around 3pm.

Since tracking this, my mornings feel smoother, my energy is more stable, and I’m finally able to schedule deep work blocks without hitting that mid-day wall.

Curious if anyone else here tracks their caffeine or other “hidden” productivity inputs like this?
