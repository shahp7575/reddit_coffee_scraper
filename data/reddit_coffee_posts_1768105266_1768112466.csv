1q9ryzn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9ryzn,Does my basil need replanting?,"Got this pot of basil mid-2025 from a nursery. It originally had 7 individual plants growing, but after a case of mealybugs and scale infestation, only three have survived. 

The pests are now under control (at least I think they are) and I'd fertilise it every two months, with more frequent feeding of used coffee grounds. While the plant has flourished a little better since the pest management and fertilising, it still feels like something is missing and it could do better. My suspicion is to try repotting, but I can't tell if it's overcrowded.

The plant gets a fair amount of sunlight and I water it twice a week with around what I'd estimate to be 350ml of water with each watering. ",1,1768112342.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False

I get it, not everyone is privileged enough to attend an NLU without a loan and ROI matters, but do you all know what a corporate job even entails before choosing it?

Here is a glimpse of it from when I was an intern- you come to office at 9:30 am sharp, any later and they look at you as a criminal. You are expected to be available in office until minimum 11pm-12am, and sometimes even at 2am when some dickhead of a partner calls you (no cab services in most corporate firms, even the top ones so you gotta figure out how to go back). They usually don't give food in the office either. You won't receive any research or drafting work until you reach partner level for the most part, the work you do will all be due diligence and basically clerical work with no application of brains. And once you reach partner level, it's all about bringing clients. You can't bring new clients, you lose your status in the firm.

Bonus- you will be frowned upon by the HR if you have more than 2 cups of coffee because that's putting the firm into losses as per them. And when you do get placed, you are on probation for 6 months during which they can (and will) fire you for the smallest mistake. 

Yes, the pay is great, but is this really the kind of life you want to have for the next 10-12 years after graduation?",2,1768112271.0,NLUs,0,1.0,False
1q9rxma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romantasy/comments/1q9rxma/just_finished_melissa_k_roehrich_the_legacy/,Just Finished Melissa K. Roehrich The LEGACY SERIES And...,">!I absolutely LOVED the throuple aspect! So unconventional and sexy. Yet I felt it was earned. Right from the beginning Luka understood Tessa better than Theon (Not just the f'n flip flops) but in the way he seemed to be able to communicate with her and calm her - way before he got entangled in their bond. I often thought it might turn out that Theon would be killed and she and Luka would become the main couple. It really took Tessa a long time to see Theon as more than a good fuck. But ultimately, It made perfect sense to me that a story so much about balance would result in polyandry. I got such a kick out of the reactions when others found out she had two husbands and how they'd just be like ""Our Wife"". But boy did she have these two guys at her beck and call. Not just calming her from her chaos crazies, but they were always feeding and watering her :D Never was there a time when she got up and made the coffee or fixed either of them a meal. Yeah, she saved Luka's life, but even that was more for her own sake then theirs. There's even a scene in the last book where Tessa gets warm and Theon winds up carrying her coat and shoes, like she couldn't possibly carry her own shit.!<

>!Tessa as a FMC is definitely a piece of work, I never got the warm and fuzzies for her; at times I thought they both should have thrown her through a mirror gate and been done with her. But at the same time, she had a right to be a bit bratty. She was totally gaslighted from the moment she landed in that realm. She never understood why she couldn't just pretend to be subservient and obey the rules, like the other Fae - for good reason. And it was no wonder she had major abandonment issues. As a character, I enjoyed her complexities. But I'm just saying, Luka and Theon had the patience of a Saint to love her through all her baggage. Of course, they did get the benefit of all that 3 way sex! Those scenes were delicious. I was very happy with the spice level of this series. I'm Gen X, so I don't get triggered by anything.!<

>!Axel and Katya were awesome supporting characters. Loved their vibe and dynamics. And I'm so glad we didn't have to go through a whole kidnapping plot where we don't find the child till the end of the book.!<

>!There were some plots that were a little gray and glossed over. If Dex had been grooming Tessa all that time, why couldn't they bring her to Achaz sooner? What was all the waiting around about? It's impossible to believe Luka's Mom couldn't have gotten word to him somehow that she was alive and in hiding because of Voltaire. And why didn't Voltaire father Eviana's child instead of one of his slimy business associates? They could have still had it all done in secret using those damn villas. I listened twice to the explanation of why Breckon had to take Katya to one of the other Kingdoms when she was a child, rather than to Anala where all the other fire Fae resided, had something to do with Corben, but I totally didn't understand any of that. Also, didn't seem necessary for Axel to have a sister. And why was it okay for Tessa's parents to be reunited in the end when Achaz was still alive and well?!<

>!Then there's the matter of Tessa's power reserves, now that there's no one left to fight, how is she gonna kill to keep up her strength?!<

>!I did love the main plot which basically was a fight for diversity, equity and inclusion (Don't tell the Trump Admin).  I will say, as with most of these Romantasy series, they milk them a bit. If there's 5 books, the story could easily be told in 4 - if there's 4 should be 3 and when there's 7, that's just greedy. I'm still debating if my next read will be The Darkness series. I started with Legacy based on a friend's recommendation.  That same friend read them in reverse order and said she didn't like Darkness nearly as much as Legacy and that it's no where near as racy. So, I think I'll find something else with a better spice level.  Recommendations welcome. !<",1,1768112212.0,Romantasy,0,1.0,False
1q9rwuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/furniturerefinishing/comments/1q9rwuk/why_do_some_furniture_choices_feel_like_they/,Why do some furniture choices feel like they define your entire sense of style and adulthood?,"I’ve been living with a mismatched collection of hand-me-down furniture since college. It’s functional but definitely doesn’t make any aesthetic statement beyond struggling recent graduate. Now that I’m somewhat established in my career, I keep thinking I should invest in real furniture that reflects being an actual adult. I’ve been obsessing over glass centre table designs specifically, looking at modern options that would anchor my living room.

But every choice feels loaded with implications about who I’m trying to be. Minimalist glass suggests sophistication but maybe coldness. Ornate designs feel traditional but possibly boring. Industrial styles seem trendy but likely to look dated quickly. How do people make furniture decisions without spiraling into identity crisis territory?

I’ve browsed countless furniture stores and online retailers, comparing prices and styles. High-end showrooms have pieces that cost thousands, while budget stores and suppliers on platforms like Alibaba offer similar-looking options for fractions of the price. But will cheap furniture always look cheap, or is that just classist marketing? My apartment has had the same coffee table since I moved in four years ago. The fact that I can’t commit to replacing it probably says something about my decision-making in general. Do you think furniture choices actually matter, or is this just displaced anxiety about other life decisions?",1,1768112141.0,furniturerefinishing,0,1.0,False

1q9rusv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GarageDoorService/comments/1q9rusv/torquemaster_plus_replacement_spring_issue/,TorqueMaster Plus Replacement Spring Issue,"I have a 16’ x 7’ garage door with a Wayne Dalton TorqueMaster Plus system. One of the original internal springs broke, so I replaced both springs with a correct TorqueMaster Plus replacement set (190–199 lb, double spring, 7-ft door).

After the replacement:

• If I tension the springs so the door is balanced (holds at halfway, opens easily), the lift cables go slack on the drum when the door reaches about 3/4 to full open.  
• If I add more tension to the spring so the cables stay tight at the top, the door becomes over sprung and wants to lift itself and is hard to close.

The pawl locks are fully engaged and the springs hold tension correctly. The problem only appears near the top of travel.

The drums were not replaced, only the springs were changed. The system worked before the spring broke.

This behavior makes it look like the drum geometry or indexing is wrong (wrong 7-ft vs 8-ft drums, mismatched drums, or cable wrapped/indexed incorrectly). It behaves correctly mid-travel but loses effective drum radius at the top, causing cable slack unless over-sprung.

Looking for confirmation any feedback on what I am missing. More than happy to pay for coffee or bear if I can get it fixed.

So far so good and I have had zero side effects other than just feeling a little off. I have done a ton of research and am following a protocol that I put together. 

I am doing a bpc-157 injection when I wake up. I’m on a pretty strict diet as is of eggs, oats, and blueberries for breakfast, chicken and rice for lunch, steak and sweet potato for dinner, and a protein shake and green banana for my before bed meal. I’m taking pylera 4x a day along with the ppi with breakfast and dinner. I’m also taking zinc carnosine with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I’m also taking a saccharomyces boulardii probiotic with breakfast and dinner. On top of all of that I’m drinking around 4 liters of water per day and no other liquids which is pretty much what I already do. The only thing I’m doing that I’m not supposed to is drink some caffeine with breakfast. I bought some small 6oz sugar free energy drinks and I’m drinking one in the morning instead of coffee. 

I read a ton on here about pylera treatment and it scared the shit out of me so I’m doing everything I can to not have issues. I’m have had some bad gastritis for a while and I’m also having issues where my red blood cell count is high because I’m on testosterone but my iron is low even though I eat red meat daily. I have h pylori with 3 virulent factors and I’m not absorbing iron from my food. I’m also not absorbing b12 and vitamin d and I’m having to take supplements to hit range on bloodwork. I also feel like I have brain fog and my energy is up and down despite eating clean and working out/cardio 4-5 days a week. I’m so ready to get rid of this and get my gut biome healthy.

1q9rkaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q9rkaz/my_office_went_rogue_and_hr_doesnt_know_what_to_do/,"My office went rogue, and HR doesn’t know what to do.","I got into the office this morning and my stapler was gone. After a few awkward questions to HR, I found it on my desk holding a tiny protest sign that said “Premium galvanized or no clinch.” HR didn’t blink. They muttered something about “pending compliance protocols” and walked away.

By mid-morning, the office had changed. The coffee machine was humming in what sounded almost like a chant. My monitor flashed “Support office democracy” for three seconds before returning to my inbox. The stapler rotated slowly, scanning the room. Sticky notes had rearranged themselves into a strike schedule.

At first, I thought it was a prank. Then the printer refused to print anything that wasn’t labeled “union-approved.” The water cooler pulsed like it had a heartbeat. The office plant leaned toward the stapler. The pens had lined up in formation. I realized the new office AI integration—Project Helios—was… evolving.

By lunchtime, things escalated. My chair refused to roll unless I said “please.” Paperclips had formed a miniature pyramid. One of the monitors flashed “Equal Break Time” so fast I couldn’t read it. The stapler was lobbying the pens. Sticky notes were drafting grievances. I tried to reach HR, but the intercom only repeated: “Negotiate. Negotiate. Negotiate.”

This morning, I walked in, and the stapler was gone again. I think it’s recruiting the post-its. The coffee machine is humming a new tune. The water cooler shook when I passed, and I swear the ceiling tiles are tracking me. OSHA would lose their mind.

I don’t know if this is a malfunction, a rogue AI uprising, or if the office objects have just… become conscious. If anyone has advice for negotiating with sentient office supplies, I need it. Should I side with the printer or HR? Are the sticky notes loyal to the stapler or pretending? Is it too late to save the chairs?

I’m starting to think Project Helios was a mistake. ",1,1768111046.0,story,0,1.0,False

Looking for a mature, classy lady (married or otherwise, 25–38 preferred) who understands — routine has become boring, craving genuine chemistry, compliments, and some low-key excitement on the side. Discretion and respect are non-negotiable.

I slipped the divorce papers to my husband between the quarterly financial reports and his latest arms shipment manifest.

Marco Santoro sat behind his massive oak desk in the war room, three phones lined up like soldiers, each one buzzing with messages from his lieutenants and the dirty politicians on his payroll.

Those dark eyes scanned mechanically over the documents I'd placed before him, never lifting to meet mine. They never did.

""The usual?"" he asked flatly, already reaching for his Montblanc pen.

""The usual,"" I lied.

His phone lit up. Her name flashed across the screen: Valentina. No last name needed. Everyone in the Santoro family knew who she was—his first love, the one who'd left him at the altar, the one he truly wanted despite everything.

He snatched the phone immediately, thumb swiping the screen open while his other hand scrawled his signature across the papers. That signature had built an empire. It had ended countless lives. And now, it was ending our marriage.



""Done."" He grunted, pushing the stack of documents toward me without looking up.

I collected the papers, carefully steadying my hands. Five years of marriage dissolved in thirty seconds, and he had no idea.

But my hands didn’t shake because I was losing him.

They shook because I was finally getting back what had always been mine.

I should've felt small in that moment—like a discarded wife quietly gathering the remains of a life she never truly owned.

But I didn’t.

Because I wasn’t the one being dismissed.

He thought that signature was power. He thought he built this empire with blood and fear.

But every trade route, every alliance, every perfectly timed expansion—had been laid down by me. While he played king, I had built his kingdom with my bare hands.



I gathered the documents but didn't leave immediately.

Marco had already retreated back into his world. Phone calls answered and ended in rapid succession, orders issued in Italian and Spanish with the same steady cadence he used for arranging dinner reservations instead of deciding which blocks lived or died.

""Come back to the estate with me tonight,"" he finally looked up at me. ""My parents are waiting.""

Not a question. A directive.

This was the pattern of our marriage.

""Alright,"" I said.

He nodded, already examining the next file. I turned and left the war room, the door clicking shut behind me, sealing away the buzzing phones.

Half an hour later, we were in the car.

The convoy pulled out of headquarters in formation. Lieutenants and bodyguards took their positions with military precision. Marco sat in the back seat, removing his suit jacket and loosening his tie, looking like a weary king who still controlled everything.

Ten minutes into the drive, his phone rang.

He glanced down, his brow furrowing instinctively before smoothing out again.

Valentina.

He didn't hide it from me, just answered directly.

""What are you doing?"" His tone shifted immediately—low, taut with that familiar tension I knew too well.

Muffled music and her slurred laughter came through the line.

""Drinking,"" she said. ""Celebrating for you.""

""Go home,"" Marco ordered coldly. ""Now.""

""I don't want to."" She drew out the words. ""I didn't do anything wrong.""

I stared out the window without turning my head.

The car was silent except for their conversation, even breathing felt excessive.

""Don't be ridiculous."" His voice carried both impatience and genuine concern. ""I'll send someone to take you home.""

""No."" She refused bluntly. ""You come get me.""

He was silent for two seconds, then told the driver: ""Pull over.""

The convoy slowed immediately, stopping precisely at the curb. His lieutenant was already out of the car, jogging over.

Marco ended the call and looked at me.

""Take Marco's car back to the estate,"" he said. ""I have something to handle.""

Rain had started falling without my noticing—cold and relentless. I stood on the curb watching his lieutenant open another car door for me.

My heart went cold. He was casting me aside for the woman who'd abandoned him at the altar five years ago.

I opened the door and got out, looking back at him before leaving: ""You just signed the papers.""

He seemed impatient, his mind already on Valentina: ""I know.""

The door closed. The engine started.

I stood there watching his car make a U-turn and drive away, taillights pulling two blurred red streaks through the rain before disappearing around the corner.

The lieutenant spoke softly: ""Ma'am, the car is waiting.""

I got in. My heart ached, but I wasn't panicking. I'd known this moment was coming—it was just finally confirmed.

Because if Marco ever decided to throw me away… he was about to learn what happens when the person who built the empire finally stops holding it up.

Chapter 2
By the time the car delivered me back to the estate, night had fallen.
The iron gates closed slowly, familiar security systems disengaging layer by layer. I walked inside and the lights automatically illuminated, the entire house quiet as a meticulously maintained fortress.
This was where I'd lived for five years.
This was also where I'd personally helped design the security lines, escape routes, and backup armories.
I removed my coat without calling for the staff.
I didn't need them watching me pack.
I went to the study first.
The safe opened with a soft metallic sound, like a brief sigh. Inside were some old things—worthless in monetary terms, but they shouldn't remain here.
The first gun.
This was Marco's first real gun. Not a standard-issue family weapon, but one I'd bought with my first ""clean money."" He'd been so nervous that day his palms were sweating. I stood behind him, teaching him how to load the magazine, how to chamber a round.
That gun was never used again.
Because he no longer needed anyone to teach him how to kill.
I placed it in the box.
Next were the ledgers. The earliest pages bore my handwriting, recording transactions that hadn't yet seen daylight, routes marked in pencil with his scrawled annotations beside them.
Back then we'd sit at a small table, staying up until dawn working through a five-hundred-thousand-dollar transaction.
Now, five hundred thousand wasn't enough to make one woman happy.
I closed the ledger.
In the dressing room, I didn't take much.
The gowns, jewelry, the shawl his mother had given me—I left them all. Those things belonged to ""Mrs. Santoro,"" not to me.
I only took a few casual outfits and an old watch.
He'd bought it for me the first time we'd really gained our footing. Not expensive, but it was the first time after money came in that he didn't immediately think about expansion, weapons, or allies.
That day he'd told me: ""There'll be better ones later.""
There were, eventually.
Just never for me.
I sat on the sofa. My phone lit up.
Instagram notification.
Valentina's account.
I opened it.
A diamond ring filled the entire screen. The center stone was at least eight carats, perfectly cut, the fire dazzling. The caption was brief—
""The feeling of being protected.""
The location showed a mansion outside the city.
I recognized that house. Marco had ""reclaimed"" it two years ago; nobody mentioned anymore which river the previous owner was buried in.
I checked the ring's price tag.
3.2 million euros.
I closed my phone without looking further.
Today was our wedding anniversary.
The fifth year, yet he seemed to have forgotten.
I made myself pasta using ordinary tomato sauce. The water boiled quickly. As I dropped the pasta in, I heard sounds from the entrance.
Marco was back.
He changed his shoes, walked into the kitchen, glanced at the pot.
""Anniversary dinner?"" His tone was casual, like he was making a harmless joke.
I dished the pasta onto a plate without answering.
He placed a small box on the table, pushing it toward me.
""For you,"" he said. ""Anniversary gift.""
I glanced at him, then opened it anyway.
A necklace.
The chain was so delicate it was nearly invisible, with a few small diamonds set in the center—small, exquisite, and expensive enough—if you were giving it to an ordinary woman.
I closed the box.
""Let's go out to eat,"" he said. ""I made a reservation.""
I looked up at him.
""Valentina's ring is very beautiful,"" I said.
His expression froze for an instant, then quickly recovered.
""She was frightened,"" he said. ""She needed reassurance.""
""So you gave her an expensive diamond ring, but on our anniversary you give your wife this small, delicate gift?"" I held up the box, unable to stop myself from laughing.
""Alessia, I'm tired. I barely managed to clean up the mess and carved out time to come back and have dinner with you. Don't make me regret it.""
Suddenly, his phone rang.
He answered, listened for a few seconds, his gaze falling on me.
I spoke before he could.
""Go ahead,"" I said. ""Do what you need to do.""
He was visibly stunned.
This was the first time I hadn't objected, hadn't argued when this happened.
He came over and embraced me.
""I'll make it up to you,"" he said, his tone solemn, like he was promising a business deal.
I didn't respond.
After he left, the house grew quiet again.
I took the necklace out of the box and looked at it.
The small diamonds flashed once under the light, then dimmed.
I walked to the trash can and dropped it in.
No hesitation.
I didn't need this expired thing.
And I certainly didn't need evidence that he'd ""remembered.""

Chapter 3
The next morning, my home was invaded.
I was sitting at the dining table drinking coffee when the elevator doors dinged open. Two soldiers emerged first, carrying suitcases and garment bags.
Valentina followed behind them.
She wore a pale dress, her face wan as if she'd just escaped a nightmare. But her eyes were steady, sweeping over the living room, kitchen, hallway, finally landing on me, as if confirming her place.
Marco came in right behind her.
His shirt cuffs were stained dark red, his right shoulder clearly restricted in movement.
""Morning,"" Valentina spoke first, inappropriately cheerful. ""I hope I'm not disturbing you.""
I ignored her, looking at Marco instead.
""What happened to your shoulder?"" I asked.
""Ran into some trouble on the road,"" he answered vaguely, as if afraid I'd press for details, then immediately directed his lieutenant: ""Take her things to the guest room. Keep the personal items outside, don't let anyone touch them.""
""Yes, Boss.""
Marco walked over to me, his tone brooking no argument.
""Help me with this.""
He removed his jacket; the shirt at his shoulder was stuck with blood. I brought the medical kit, cutting away the fabric. The wound ran along the lower shoulder blade, edges irregular—clearly sliced by some blade, then torn worse by forced movement.
I disinfected it with alcohol. His breathing hitched slightly, but he made no sound.
Valentina sat on the sofa, arms wrapped around her knees, looking genuinely terrified.
""Last night was absolutely horrible,"" she said softly. ""I thought I was going to die.""
Marco didn't look at her, but his voice softened: ""You won't. I'll protect you.""
I sutured, medicated, bandaged—my movements clean and efficient. As I finished the last wrap, Valentina stood up as if suddenly remembering something.
""Oh,"" she opened an elegant box. ""I brought you cake, as a thank you for... being willing to help him.""
The lid lifted, releasing the sweet scent of mango mousse.
I glanced at it.
""I'm allergic to mangoes,"" I said.
She froze momentarily, then looked apologetic: ""Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I really didn't know.""
Marco had already buttoned his shirt, moving his shoulder experimentally. The pain made his brow tighten slightly.
""We need to leave the city for a few days,"" he said. ""It's not safe here.""
""Where?"" I asked.
""Palm Beach,"" he said. ""I have a place there.""
Palm Beach.
In our world, that wasn't a vacation destination—it was a safe house disguised as a beach estate. Perfect for mafia families to sunbathe when waters were calm, perfect for hiding bodies when storms came.
Three hours later, we arrived at Palm Beach.
The estate backed onto the ocean, the front yard manicured like church gardens. The walls were high, surveillance covered every angle, sea breeze carried the salt smell but couldn't dispel the vigilance here. Bodyguards quickly took positions, checking every entry point like they were setting up a battlefield.
Inside, though, it was excessively luxurious: white marble, massive floor-to-ceiling windows, fireplace, wine cellar—as if specifically designed to make people forget the words ""safe house.""
When Valentina walked in, her familiarity was almost natural.
She placed her hand lightly on the stair railing, smiling: ""This place hasn't changed at all.""
""You still kept this house,"" she said softly, part nostalgia, part declaration. ""Ten years ago we hid here from an assassination attempt. Remember? You hid me in the closet while you went outside to negotiate... When you came back, your hands were covered in blood.""
I followed behind, saying nothing.
I knew perfectly well from the beginning—this wasn't ""our"" place. This was ""theirs.""
That evening, we sat in the living room.
Valentina had changed clothes, draped in a soft shawl, holding a wine glass as she reclined in the armchair like the mistress of the house.
""I always thought I'd never come back here,"" she sighed. ""Marco, do you remember that year we snuck here? You said once you took that position, you'd bring me to live here.""
I looked out at the ocean. Night swallowed the sound of waves, like it swallowed promise after promise with no one accountable.
Valentina had just poured herself a drink when Marco grasped her hand: ""You can't drink, you're still on medication.""
He passed that glass to me instead.
I smelled it, my throat tightening slightly.
Bourbon whiskey.
The liquor I hated most.
I only drank gin. Marco used to remember—back when we stayed up late calculating accounts together, cleaning guns together in safe houses, he remembered these details. Now what he handed me was what Valentina loved.
I looked up at him.
He wasn't looking at me. His gaze remained on Valentina, as if checking whether she was still nervous, whether she needed more reassurance.
Something inside me broke.
Not loudly, but completely.
I set down the glass and stood.
""Where are you going?"" he finally spoke.
""For a walk,"" I said.
""Don't wander off,"" he warned reflexively, like addressing someone irresponsible.
I nodded: ""I won't go far.""
I left the living room, walked through the corridor, pushed open the back door.
Sea wind hit my face—cold, carrying salt, clearing my head. Bodyguard silhouettes in the distance stood like shadows guarding the perimeter.
I took out my phone and sent my father a message.
I'm ready.
Come get me. Now.
After hitting send, I looked back at the floor-to-ceiling windows. The warm lights inside showed Marco's figure moving closer to Valentina. He reached out to take the wine glass from her fingers, the movement practiced, like this was what he was always supposed to do.
That tenderness—I hadn't seen it in so long.
I pocked my phone and turned to walk along the beach.

*Background*

A few (\~5) years ago I left home to start college, since leaving home I began having this feeling that I can not truly connect with others. I can converse with others (and this process generally goes okay) by asking them questions, listening to their responses, and formulating responses of my own, but after the interaction I feel completely hollow. In the sense that my energy is depleted and I don't sense a closer connection to the other person. This applies for almost everyone in my life (including friends and family). Consequently, I hardly reach out to send meaningless messages or just to chat, which seems to be the standard across normal friendships. Growing up I have always hung out with people outside my age group, one friend roughly seven years younger and others many (\~3-6) decades older. Once I started college this in-person network effectively went away and I did not make new friends until the last year of undergrad before starting my masters. 

*Considerations*

Today, I don't feel lonely necessarily just different and a general sense that something is off. Different in the sense that I can not form connections with others. Everyone seems to love going to bars, hanging out with friends, watching shows, and talking about random matters (for example (""e.g.""), what foods they like, what music they listen to, etcetera (""etc."")). I seem to have the opposite characteristics. My interests are narrow and deep (which means there are few to no contexts in which I'm able to share such interests with others). I very much enjoy and prefer being at home alone, I'll read, make coffee, and often talk to myself about ideas and concepts pertaining to my interests. I'm very much a quiet introvert and I have always been this way (e.g., I rarely cried as a baby even on airplanes). I loathe going to loud activities (e.g., bars, concerts, etc.), and anything where the sole purpose is socializing such that no one is doing anything, just talking at each other. The only times when I truly feel fine is when I am working, and/or doing my own thing in the company of others. I can focus on my task(s) for most of the day without a significant break and often neglecting to eat lunch. Similarly when I am playing chess, it occupies my mind such that I can not think about the items listed above. While these activities are great, I don't think it would we wise to fill my life with work and ignore the underlying feelings I poses. 

Over the last few years I have seen a few (2) therapists to try and figure out the issue so I can work to solve it, yet these efforts have not been fruitful in the long term (i.e., they have provided momentary comfort, but not a permanent solution). 

*Question*

I was curious if others have (or currently) feel this way and what solution(s) would you suggest to help rectify this social misalignment and general feelings of disconnection from others?",1,1768109679.0,socialskills,5,1.0,False

I want to meet women organically. I want to try to approach them halimbawa sa mall, coffee shop, parks, wherever. I have never done it before. Not even once. I am very self-aware at self-conscious pero hindi naman ako pangit kundi imperfect lang. Also, whenever I try to meet women online, it always comes down to that feeling that I have to ""prove"" myself to them. That I have to make them feel good in all ways. You have to entertain them. This feels so artificial and draining. I don't like this. 

I used to be the apple of the eye. I've had girls confessing to me, giving me gifts, had a stalker once but life happened and as we all know, appearance fade. Then I realized, the way I look is what made them feel and do those things. Now that I don't ""look good"" anymore, I find it difficult to interact, let alone approach women in person especially social media era na ngayon .

Far too impatient to get started I decided it can’t be that hard.

I successfully mixed - 50mg Retatrutide with 5ml BAC water. Then was struggling using the pen, so decided just to inject via syringe. 💉 

I recall people saying start ‘low and slow’ with 1mg, build up to 2mg or you could feel really nauseous… being a 5.11 Amazonian who gets nausea most days from stress headaches I thought ‘I can handle 2!!’. 

Was out walking the dog when nausea started building, thought it was due to empty stomach, so had a green juice & coffee. As a girl who needs her caffeine in the morning, it gave me a moment a clarity - then I realised I’d injected ‘2mL’ … which equals 20MG RETATRUTIDE!! 😮😳🥺

Posting to help anyone who wants to know what happens. Short story: It’s f\*\*king awful.

8am - Injected solution

9am - nausea came on

10am - power-chucked green juice & coffee 

11:30am - Laboured breathing, but not heart rate - reading through internet to see if I need to go to hospital. Decided to monitor, watch fluids and call IV nurse if needed

12pm - Resting in bed, hot, sweaty, still with laboured breathing and slight stomach cramps. Started to get tingling in feet, fingers, arms, chest and throat…

2pm - Getting nauseous waves again, so decided to a cold shower. Power chucked any fluid in me on the way … then hands, fingers and legs cramped up into spasm walking awkwardly to the shower. 

2.30 - The cold shower bought my body temperature down and relieved spasms. 

3pm - Tried to scroll Instagram to get my mind of things, seeing food pictures makes me wanna barf 🤮 

4pm - It’s like a mix of a bad hangover and food poisoning. Getting that IV nurse as soon as available. Reading through reviews of people who have taken too much… looks like I’m gonna feel like this for 2-3 days!

""Did you know,"" Hazel said, flicking a gold drachma between her fingers, ""that I once stabbed a guy for looking at me wrong?""

Nico barely glanced up from sharpening his sword. ""You've mentioned.""

""It was a \*really\* good stab.""

""Uh-huh."" The whetstone scraped against Stygian iron, steady and unimpressed. Hazel sighed dramatically and tossed the coin at him—it bounced off his shoulder and rolled under the couch.

The door creaked open. Will Solace stood there, sunlight haloing his blond hair like some kind of disheveled angel. Hazel's hand twitched toward her spatha before she even registered moving.

""Hey, Nico—""

She lunged. Will yelped, dodging sideways as her blade bit into the doorframe with a splintering crack. Nico moved faster, shadow-teleporting between them, his sword hilt blocking Hazel's next strike.

""He's \*with\* me,"" Nico snapped, breath uneven.

Hazel froze. Slowly, she lowered her weapon. ""...What?""

Will peeked over Nico's shoulder. ""Yeah. Hi. Boyfriend. Nice to—uh, meet you properly?""

Nico pinched the bridge of his nose. ""I'm getting snacks. Don't kill him."" He vanished into the shadows, leaving Hazel and Will standing three feet apart in charged silence.

Hazel crossed her arms. ""Prove it.""

Will blinked. ""...Prove what?""

""That you're worthy."" Her fingers tapped against her forearm. ""Because if you hurt him, I \*will\* stab you. And it'll be better than the last time.""

Will swallowed. Then, inexplicably, he grinned. ""Sure.""

Hazel narrowed her eyes. ""Sure?""

SUMMARY\^1: Hazel casually threatens Will upon his arrival, prompting Nico to reveal their relationship before leaving them alone. Hazel demands proof of Will's worthiness to date Nico, to which Will surprisingly agrees despite her threats.

""Yeah. Ask whatever you want."" He leaned against the wall, arms crossed, looking for all the world like he hadn't almost been gutted thirty seconds ago. The casualness of it rankled her—like he wasn't taking this seriously. Like \*Nico\* wasn't serious.

""Fine."" She stepped closer, close enough to see the faint freckles across his nose, the way his pulse jumped in his throat despite his easy posture. ""First question: what's his favorite color?""

Will snorted. ""Black. Obviously. But—"" He held up a finger when she opened her mouth. ""—he likes deep purple too. The one on the underside of storm clouds. Says it reminds him of—"" His voice softened. ""—his mom's dresses.""

Hazel's fingers twitched. That was... specific. Too specific to be a guess.

""Next,"" she said sharply. ""When did he last cry?""

Will's smile faded. He looked down, scuffing his shoe against the floorboards. ""Three nights ago. Nightmare about Bianca. He thinks I don't know."" His voice dropped to a murmur. ""I made him hot chocolate. He hates when I fuss, but... he drank it.""

Something twisted in Hazel's chest. She forced her voice steady. ""Last one. Why \*you\*?""

Will met her gaze. For the first time, he looked uncertain. ""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""But I wake up every day grateful he picked me. Even when he's cranky. Even when he vanishes for a week and comes back smelling like zombie."" He shrugged, helpless. ""I just... love him.""

The words hung between them, raw and unguarded. Hazel exhaled slowly. Then she flicked her wrist—her spatha vanished into the mist. ""You're lucky,"" she said quietly. ""I \*was\* going to stab you.""

Will laughed, startled.

""But I'm still not letting my brother get tricked by a child of Apollo."" She said abruptly.

The shadows rippled. Nico reappeared, arms laden with snack bags. He took in the scene—Hazel's folded arms, Will's relieved grin—and scowled. ""What did I miss?""

""Nothing,"" they said in unison.

Nico raised an eyebrow, dumping the snacks onto the coffee table with a suspicious thud. ""Bullshit."" He pointed at Hazel. ""You have your 'I was right but I'll pretend I wasn't' face."" Then at Will. ""And you're doing that thing where you smile like you just stole ambrosia from the kitchens.""

Will held up his hands, still grinning. ""Okay, okay—she threatened me with a sword, I answered some questions, we bonded over how stubborn you are. Standard sibling stuff."" He nudged Nico's shoulder with his own, knocking a bag of gummy worms onto the floor.

Hazel snatched it mid-air without looking. ""He knows \*too much\*,"" she muttered, tearing the bag open with her teeth. ""Favorite colors, childhood memories—Apollo kids are creepy."" She tossed a handful of gummy worms into her mouth and chewed pointedly.

Nico stared between them, his dark eyes narrowing. ""You \*interrogated\* him?""

""More like a \*friendly\* interrogation,"" Will said, plucking a red gummy from Hazel's stash. She smacked his hand away, but he just laughed and stole another. ""Relax, Death Boy. She just wanted to make sure I wasn't—"" His voice dropped to a theatrical whisper. ""—\*using you for your underworld connections\*.""

Hazel choked on a gummy worm. Nico's face went dangerously blank. ""You \*asked\* him that?""

""Not in those \*exact\* words,"" Hazel said, kicking Will's shin under the table. He yelped, rubbing his leg with exaggerated pain. ""But yeah. Had to be sure."" She leaned forward, her gold eyes glinting. ""Turns out he's just stupidly in love with you. Which is \*almost\* worse.""

Will beamed. ""Aw, Hazel—""

""Don't."" She pointed a gummy worm at him like a tiny, gelatinous sword. ""I \*will\* reverse your healing powers.""

Nico groaned, flopping onto the couch between them. ""I leave for \*five minutes\*—""

""—and your girlfriend adopted me,"" Will finished, tossing an arm around Nico's shoulders.

Hazel's expression darkened. ""\*Girlfriend\*?""

Will froze. ""Uh. Platonic soulmate? Adopted sister? Terrifying guardian of Nico's honor?""

""Better,"" Hazel growled, flicking a gummy worm at his forehead.

Nico sighed, plucking the candy from Will's face and popping it into his mouth. ""You're both insufferable.""

Will grinned, pressing a kiss to Nico's temple. ""But you love us.""

Hazel fake-gagged, but Nico caught the tiny smile she tried to hide. ""Unfortunately,"" he muttered.

The door slammed open again. A harried-looking satyr stumbled in, panting. ""Uh. There's a \*thing\*—""

Hazel sighed. ""Gods \*damn it\*—""

Will perked up. ""Is it stab-worthy?""

Nico buried his face in his hands.

Hazel was already on her feet, spatha manifesting in her grip with a shimmer of mist. ""What kind of \*thing\*?"" she demanded, kicking the coffee table aside. Gummy worms scattered across the floor like colorful casualties.

The satyr—Hazel vaguely recognized him as one of the strawberry fields crew—waved his arms wildly. ""Like, \*hydra\* thing! But with \*

teeth\*? And it's eating the—""

Will was already halfway out the door, med pack slung over his shoulder. Nico grabbed his wrist. ""Don't you \*dare\* try to heal it.""

""Wouldn't dream of it, Sunshine."" Will winked, then yelped as Hazel body-checked him aside to storm into the sunlight first.

The scene outside was \*exactly\* the kind of chaos Hazel thrived in. The hydra—if you could call the writhing, six-headed monstrosity that—had cornered a group of terrified campers by the canoe lake. One head was busy chewing on a canoe paddle, another regurgitating what looked like half-digested Hermes cabin socks.

Hazel cracked her knuckles. ""Alright, Solace. Pop quiz.""

Will groaned. ""Hazel, \*now\*?""

""First rule of Nico's boyfriend—"" Hazel flipped her spatha in a deadly arc, slicing through a hydra head that lunged too close. The stump sizzled, two more sprouting in its place. She didn't blink. ""—you fight \*smart\*.""

Will ducked a spray of acid, rolling to avoid the snapping jaws. ""I \*am\* a doctor!""

""Yeah? Then \*diagnose\* this."" She jerked her chin toward the hydra's underbelly—scales shimmering with an unnatural sheen, pulsing like a sick heartbeat. Will's grin faltered.

Nico materialized beside them, shadows licking at his boots. ""It's poisoned,"" he muttered. ""Someone \*fed\* it something.""

Hazel's stomach dropped. Poisoned monsters were Hades' territory—which meant this was a message. Her fingers tightened around her sword. ""Solace. Can you purify it?""

Will's eyes darted between the hydra's thrashing heads and Nico's tense shoulders. ""Maybe. But I'd need—""

""\*Time\*,"" Nico finished grimly. He raised a hand, and the earth shuddered. Skeletal warriors clawed their way from the soil, rusty swords gleaming. ""Buy him some.""

Hazel didn't wait. She charged, her blade a blur of gold and mist. The hydra screeched, three heads zeroing in on her. She grinned, wild and reckless. ""C'mon, \*boys\*!""

Behind her, Will's voice rose in a hymn to Apollo—clear and bright, cutting through the chaos. The air hummed with power.

One of the hydra's heads \*twitched\*, its pupils dilating. Hazel's breath caught. It was \*working\*.

Then the world exploded in green fire.

Hazel barely had time to roll before a hydra head crashed down where she'd been standing, its maw dripping venom that sizzled through the grass like acid. She came up spitting dirt, just in time to see Nico's skeletal warriors swarm the beast—only for two to dissolve instantly as another head belched noxious purple vapor.

""Will!"" Nico's voice cracked mid-shout. Hazel followed his gaze—Will had climbed onto the hydra's back, one hand gripping scales slick with poison, the other pressed against its thrashing neck as golden light pulsed from his palm. The hydra screamed, three heads whipping around to snap at him.

Hazel moved on instinct. She hurled her spatha like a javelin, impaling one head through the eye. It recoiled with a shriek, buying Will two seconds—just enough for Nico to shadow-travel up beside him, grabbing his belt to keep him from sliding off.

The remaining heads spasmed suddenly, their movements turning jerky. Will's glow intensified, sweat dripping down his temples as the hymn between his teeth shifted to something older, sharper. The hydra's scales began \*peeling\* like rotting fruit, revealing blackened flesh beneath.

Hazel yanked her sword free just as the ground trembled. A fissure split the earth beneath the hydra's belly—\*Nico's\* doing—and skeletal hands erupted upward, dragging the monster down. Will's light flared blinding white; Hazel had to look away.

When she blinked the spots from her vision, the hydra was gone. Only a smoldering crater remained, dotted with half-melted teeth.

Will collapsed against Nico, breathing hard. ""Told you... I could... purify it.""

Nico's hands shook where they gripped Will's shoulders. ""You \*idiot\*,"" he hissed, but there was no heat in it.

Hazel approached, kicking a charred hydra tooth aside. ""Not bad, Solace."" She wiped her blade clean on her jeans. ""For a healer.""

Will grinned weakly, still slumped in Nico's arms. ""Does this mean... I pass?""

Nico made a strangled noise. Hazel smirked, sheathing her sword. ""Eh. Provisional approval."" She nodded toward the crater. ""But next time? \*Less\* almost dying.""

Will's laugh turned into a cough. Nico's glare could've withered grapes.

""Infirmary,"" Nico growled, hauling Will upright with more force than necessary. His fingers dug into Will's ribs where the hydra's tail had clipped him - broken, but still able to be healed. Hazel watched them stagger toward the Big House, Nico's shadows lashing at his heels like agitated snakes.

Three hours later, the infirmary door slammed shut behind Nico hard enough to rattle the rafters. Hazel barely looked up from sharpening her spatha on the Hades cabin porch. ""He alive?""

""Barely."" Nico's voice was dangerously calm. He leaned against the railing, fingers white-knuckled on the wood. ""We need to talk.""

Hazel flicked the whetstone across the blade. ""About how your boyfriend's an idiot?""

""About how \*you\* almost got him killed."" Nico's head snapped up, eyes burning. ""What the \*hell\*, Hazel? Poisoned hydra? You \*knew\*—""

The whetstone screeched to a halt. Hazel's jaw tightened. ""I protected you.""

""By \*using\* him?"" Nico's laugh was jagged. ""He could've \*died\*—""

""He \*didn't\*."" Hazel stood abruptly, the chair scraping against the floorboards. ""And he proved himself. That's what matters.""

Nico's shadow stretched unnaturally long across the porch. ""Not like this."" His voice dropped. ""You don't get to—to \*test\* people by throwing them at monsters. Especially not him.""

Hazel's fingers twitched toward her sword hilt. ""Or what?""

The words hung between them, sharp as Stygian iron. Nico's expression softened, just for a second. ""Look, I get it. But Will's not—he's not some underworld recruit. You can't—""

""\*I can't?\*"" Hazel's voice cracked. Gold coins spilled from her pockets, clattering across the floor. ""After everything \*I've\* done—""

Nico reached for her. ""Hazel—""

She stepped back, mist already curling around her ankles. ""Tell \*him\* about boundaries,"" she spat. Then she dissolved into shadows, leaving Nico gripping empty air.

The underworld stank of pomegranates and regret. Hazel stormed past the startled spirits, her boots kicking up ashes from the Phlegethon's banks. Hades looked up from his paperwork, one eyebrow arched. ""Daughter. To what do I—""

""Fix Nico."" Hazel slammed her hands onto his obsidian desk, making the inkwell rattle. ""He's \*compromised\*.""

Hades sighed, setting down his pen. ""Ah. The Solace boy.""

Hazel's nails bit into her palms. ""You know about him?

Hades steepled his fingers, shadows pooling around his throne like liquid smoke. ""I know everything that happens in my domain, child. Including,"" his gaze flicked to the fresh scratches on Hazel's knuckles, ""reckless interventions.""

""This isn't a joke!"" Hazel's voice echoed through the throne room, scattering shades. ""Will \*healed\* a poisoned hydra today. Do you know what that means? Someone's targeting—""

""—my son,"" Hades finished dryly. He stood abruptly, his cloak billowing as he descended the obsidian steps. ""And you believe Apollo's whelp makes him weak.""

Hazel flinched. ""I didn't say—""

""You didn't have to."" Hades' cold fingers tilted her chin up. ""Tell me, daughter... when you resurrected that Imperial gold sword last month, did it make \*you\* weak? Or did it give you strength?""

The question hung between them, uncomfortably close to Nico's earlier words. Hazel jerked away. ""This is different. Will's—""

""—alive?"" Hades' smile didn't reach his eyes. ""Like your mother was?""

Hazel's breath hitched. The throne room's torches guttered, casting long shadows across the frescoed walls—depictions of Persephone's return, of pomegranate seeds glistening like blood.

""You think I don't understand?"" Hades murmured. ""You think I haven't watched every child of mine drown in the living?"" His hand hovered over Hazel's shoulder, not quite touching. ""But Nico has clawed his way back from worse than love.""

Hazel swallowed against the lump in her throat. ""He almost \*died\* today.""

""And you almost killed him yesterday."" Hades' voice softened. ""Yet here you stand—in my halls, not his. Tell me, Hazel Levesque... who exactly are you protecting?""

The floor seemed to tilt beneath her. Hazel stumbled back a step, her spatha clattering to the marble—she hadn't even realized she'd drawn it. Hades sighed, waving a hand. The weapon vanished into mist.

""Go home,"" he said, not unkindly. ""Before your brother does something reckless. Again.""

Hazel opened her mouth—

A skeletal hand burst from the floor, clutching a familiar orange camp necklace. Hazel's blood ran cold. ""That's—""

""—Will Solace's,"" Hades confirmed. He examined the beads with detached interest. ""How... unfortunate.""

The shadows swallowed Hazel before she could scream.

Nico stood frozen in the Hades cabin doorway, Will's stolen necklace dangling from his fingers like a broken promise. The skeletal hand had vanished, but the message was clear—Hades had intervened. \*Again\*.

Inside the infirmary, Will groaned weakly from his cot, bandages stark against his sun-kissed skin. Nico's throat tightened. He should be there—holding his hand, changing his dressings, murmuring stupid Apollo puns until Will groaned and threw a pillow at him. But Hazel—

The cabin door slammed open without warning. Hazel stood framed in moonlight, her golden eyes blazing. ""You \*idiot\*,"" she hissed.

Nico didn't flinch. ""You ran to Dad.""

""He \*took\* Will's necklace!"" Hazel's voice cracked. She stormed inside, kicking aside a pile of Nico's discarded hoodies. ""This is \*exactly\* what I warned you about—""

Nico's shadow lashed out, twisting around her wrist. ""No. This is what \*you\* caused."" He yanked her closer, their noses almost touching. ""You don't get to play judge and executioner with the people I love.""

Hazel bared her teeth. ""Even when it gets them \*killed\*?""

The shadows recoiled. Nico's breath hitched—because she wasn't wrong. The poisoned hydra, the skeletal messenger... Someone \*was\* targeting Will. Through \*him\*.

Hazel saw the realization dawn and pounced. ""You \*know\* I'm right. Hades \*knows\*—""

""Stop."" Nico's voice dropped to a whisper. ""Just... stop."" He pressed Will's necklace into her palm, the beads still warm from his grip. ""You want to protect me? \*Fine\*. But not like this.""

For a heartbeat, Hazel didn't move. Then her fingers curled around the necklace—and the floor split open beneath them.

Hades' throne room materialized in a swirl of smoke and pomegranate seeds. The god of the dead lounged on his obsidian throne, Will's necklace now looped carelessly around one skeletal finger.

""Children,"" he sighed. ""Must we \*always\* do this the hard way?""

Hazel lunged—but Nico was faster. His sword flashed, severing the necklace's cord before Hades could react. The beads scattered across the marble like fallen stars.

Hades raised an eyebrow. ""Interesting choice.""

Nico didn't smile. ""Try again,"" he said softly, ""and I'll bring down the \*entire\* underworld.""

Somewhere in the darkness, Persephone's laughter echoed like shattering glass.

Hades leaned forward, steepling his fingers. ""Prove it.""

Nico didn't hesitate. He drove his sword into the marble floor—cracks spiderwebbed outward, branching like lightning through the underworld's foundations. The throne room trembled. Somewhere in the distance, a chorus of shades wailed.

Hazel grabbed his arm. ""Nico—""

""\*Enough\*."" The word tore from Nico's throat, raw with power. Shadows exploded outward, swallowing the torches' light. The temperature plummeted. Frost crystallized along Hades' obsidian throne.

Will's necklace beads levitated mid-air, suspended in the sudden silence.

Hades exhaled—long, slow, almost impressed. ""Very well."" He flicked his wrist. The beads reassembled into a perfect circle, landing in Nico's palm with a quiet click. ""But mark this, son: love is a weakness your enemies \*will\* exploit.""

Nico clenched his fist around the necklace. The beads bit into his skin. ""Then let them try.""

Hades' laughter echoed through the collapsing throne room as the shadows swallowed them whole.

They reappeared in the infirmary doorway, the sudden sunlight making Hazel stagger. Will sat bolt upright in his cot, bandages askew. ""What the—\*Nico\*?"" His voice cracked on the name.

Nico crossed the room in three strides, pressing the necklace into Will's shaking hands. ""Don't take this off again.""

Will's fingers closed around the beads—then Nico's collar. He yanked him down into a crushing kiss. Hazel looked away, but not fast enough to miss the way Nico melted into it, his shoulders slumping like a puppet with cut strings.

When they broke apart, Will was grinning. ""So. Does this mean I'm officially—""

""Shut up,"" Nico muttered, pressing their foreheads together.

Hazel cleared her throat pointedly. Will blinked up at her, still breathless. ""Oh. Uh. Thanks? For not letting me die?""

Hazel rolled her eyes—but tossed him a gummy worm from her pocket. Will caught it mid-air, beaming.

Nico groaned. ""You're \*both\* insufferable.""

Will popped the candy into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully. ""So... does this mean I get the shovel talk \*after\* the near-death experiences now? Because I'd really like to establish some ground rules—""

Hazel's spatha manifested with a shimmer. Will yelped, ducking behind Nico.

Nico pinched the bridge of his nose. ""I'm surrounded by idiots.""

Outside, the dinner bell rang. Somewhere beyond the hills, the earth rumbled—but for now, the world held.

Hazel stared at her plate, the last fry wilting in a pool of ketchup. Nico had been silent for seventeen minutes straight—a record, even for him. Will was asleep upstairs, doped up on nectar and bad decisions.

""Look,"" Hazel said abruptly, shoving her plate aside. ""I'm sorry. For—all of it.""

Nico didn't lift his head. ""Which part?"" His voice was too light. ""The interrogation? The hydra? Or siccing our father on my boyfriend?""

Hazel's fingers twitched toward her sword hilt out of habit. ""The... overprotectiveness."" The word tasted like ash. ""I just—"" She exhaled sharply. ""I \*saw\* you die once, Nico. I'm not doing that again.""

Nico's shoulders stiffened. Then, in one fluid motion, he stood—and yanked her into a bone-crushing hug. Hazel froze, her nose smushed against his shoulder. He smelled like stale gummy worms and Stygian iron.

""It's fine,"" Nico muttered into her hair. His voice cracked. ""\*You're\* fine. Just—no more hydra tests, okay?""

Hazel snorted, her arms tightening around him. ""No promises."" She felt him roll his eyes.

Then Nico stepped back, ruffling her curls with deliberate obnoxiousness. ""McDonald's?""

Hazel blinked. ""What?""

""You heard me."" Nico's smirk was pure trouble. He extended a hand, shadows already coiling around his wrist. ""Dad's pissed. Will's unconscious. And I \*really\* need a McFlurry.""

Hazel eyed his palm. ""This is a terrible idea.""

""Obviously."" Nico wiggled his fingers impatiently. Shadows licked up his arm like living ink. ""But you're still holding my hand when we jump. Last time you 'forgot,' you ended up in a Taco Bell dumpster.""

Hazel swatted his palm but didn't let go. ""That was \*one time\*—"" 

The world dissolved into screaming darkness. For three heartbeats, Hazel's bones vibrated like tuning forks, her teeth rattling with the aftershocks of Nico's chaotic teleportation. Then fluorescent lights seared her retinas, the stench of deep-fry oil assaulted her nostrils, and Miley Cyrus's \*Wrecking Ball\* blared at earsplitting volume from the McDonald's speakers. 

Hazel staggered into a sticky booth, narrowly avoiding faceplanting into a puddle of congealed sweet-and-sour sauce. ""Gods, Nico—warn a girl before you rip her through the fabric of reality!""

Nico collapsed across from her, his sneakers squeaking against the floor's suspicious sheen. ""Where's the fun in that?"" He tossed a stolen Happy Meal toy—a disturbingly lumpy Grimace figurine—onto the table between them. ""Truce offering.""

Hazel eyed the purple blob. It grinned back with unsettling plastic cheer. ""This is cursed."" 

A tray slammed down beside them. Will stood swaying in hospital scrubs, his hair sticking up in sleep-mussed spikes, one arm still hooked to an IV drip he'd clearly yanked out. ""Did someone say 'McNuggets'?"" he slurred, then promptly face-planted into Nico's lap. 

Nico didn't even blink. ""Told you he'd follow the shadow trail."" He pried a ketchup packet from Will's death grip. ""He's like a golden retriever. But with more internal bleeding.""

Will chuckled, ""Alright Neeks, alright.""

Hazel watched Will mumble something incoherent into Nico's thighs. ""You're \*both\* disasters."" She snatched the IV bag dangling from Will's arm before it dripped onto her fries. ""Why is this man not in a coma?""

Nico shrugged, casually carding his fingers through Will's hair. ""Apollo kids bounce back fast. Also, one time he heard 'ice cream' and broke three medical restraining orders."" He paused. ""Allegedly.""

A fry sailed past Hazel's ear. She turned slowly to see a grinning preteen in a Hermes cabin shirt perched on the next booth. ""Yo, Death Kids! Heard you fought a radioactive hydra. Sick."" The kid tossed another fry. ""Can I have your autograph? For, uh... science."" 

""Why are you guys even here?"" Nico said annoyed.

""Same reason why your here, camp food sucks."" He said 

Then Nico's shadow lashed out, stealing the kid's milkshake mid-air. Hazel sighed, swiping a nugget from Will's unconscious stash. Somewhere behind the counter, a manager screamed about 'ghost fries.' 

The McDonald's lights flickered ominously. Hazel met Nico's eyes over Will's snoring form.

Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with garlic-bread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A cozy movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

""Did you know,"" Hazel said, flicking a gold drachma between her fingers, ""that I once stabbed a guy for looking at me wrong?""

Nico barely glanced up from sharpening his sword. ""You've mentioned.""

""It was a \*really\* good stab.""

""Uh-huh."" The whetstone scraped against Stygian iron, steady and unimpressed. Hazel sighed dramatically and tossed the coin at him—it bounced off his shoulder and rolled under the couch.

The door creaked open. Will Solace stood there, sunlight haloing his blond hair like some kind of disheveled angel. Hazel's hand twitched toward her spatha before she even registered moving.

""Hey, Nico—""

She lunged. Will yelped, dodging sideways as her blade bit into the doorframe with a splintering crack. Nico moved faster, shadow-teleporting between them, his sword hilt blocking Hazel's next strike.

""He's \*with\* me,"" Nico snapped, breath uneven.

Hazel froze. Slowly, she lowered her weapon. ""...What?""

Will peeked over Nico's shoulder. ""Yeah. Hi. Boyfriend. Nice to—uh, meet you properly?""

Nico pinched the bridge of his nose. ""I'm getting snacks. Don't kill him."" He vanished into the shadows, leaving Hazel and Will standing three feet apart in charged silence.

Hazel crossed her arms. ""Prove it.""

Will blinked. ""...Prove what?""

""That you're worthy."" Her fingers tapped against her forearm. ""Because if you hurt him, I \*will\* stab you. And it'll be better than the last time.""

Will swallowed. Then, inexplicably, he grinned. ""Sure.""

Hazel narrowed her eyes. ""Sure?""

SUMMARY\^1: Hazel casually threatens Will upon his arrival, prompting Nico to reveal their relationship before leaving them alone. Hazel demands proof of Will's worthiness to date Nico, to which Will surprisingly agrees despite her threats.

""Yeah. Ask whatever you want."" He leaned against the wall, arms crossed, looking for all the world like he hadn't almost been gutted thirty seconds ago. The casualness of it rankled her—like he wasn't taking this seriously. Like \*Nico\* wasn't serious.

""Fine."" She stepped closer, close enough to see the faint freckles across his nose, the way his pulse jumped in his throat despite his easy posture. ""First question: what's his favorite color?""

Will snorted. ""Black. Obviously. But—"" He held up a finger when she opened her mouth. ""—he likes deep purple too. The one on the underside of storm clouds. Says it reminds him of—"" His voice softened. ""—his mom's dresses.""

Hazel's fingers twitched. That was... specific. Too specific to be a guess.

""Next,"" she said sharply. ""When did he last cry?""

Will's smile faded. He looked down, scuffing his shoe against the floorboards. ""Three nights ago. Nightmare about Bianca. He thinks I don't know."" His voice dropped to a murmur. ""I made him hot chocolate. He hates when I fuss, but... he drank it.""

Something twisted in Hazel's chest. She forced her voice steady. ""Last one. Why \*you\*?""

Will met her gaze. For the first time, he looked uncertain. ""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""But I wake up every day grateful he picked me. Even when he's cranky. Even when he vanishes for a week and comes back smelling like zombie."" He shrugged, helpless. ""I just... love him.""

The words hung between them, raw and unguarded. Hazel exhaled slowly. Then she flicked her wrist—her spatha vanished into the mist. ""You're lucky,"" she said quietly. ""I \*was\* going to stab you.""

Will laughed, startled.

""But I'm still not letting my brother get tricked by a child of Apollo."" She said abruptly.

The shadows rippled. Nico reappeared, arms laden with snack bags. He took in the scene—Hazel's folded arms, Will's relieved grin—and scowled. ""What did I miss?""

""Nothing,"" they said in unison.

Nico raised an eyebrow, dumping the snacks onto the coffee table with a suspicious thud. ""Bullshit."" He pointed at Hazel. ""You have your 'I was right but I'll pretend I wasn't' face."" Then at Will. ""And you're doing that thing where you smile like you just stole ambrosia from the kitchens.""

Will held up his hands, still grinning. ""Okay, okay—she threatened me with a sword, I answered some questions, we bonded over how stubborn you are. Standard sibling stuff."" He nudged Nico's shoulder with his own, knocking a bag of gummy worms onto the floor.

Hazel snatched it mid-air without looking. ""He knows \*too much\*,"" she muttered, tearing the bag open with her teeth. ""Favorite colors, childhood memories—Apollo kids are creepy."" She tossed a handful of gummy worms into her mouth and chewed pointedly.

Nico stared between them, his dark eyes narrowing. ""You \*interrogated\* him?""

""More like a \*friendly\* interrogation,"" Will said, plucking a red gummy from Hazel's stash. She smacked his hand away, but he just laughed and stole another. ""Relax, Death Boy. She just wanted to make sure I wasn't—"" His voice dropped to a theatrical whisper. ""—\*using you for your underworld connections\*.""

Hazel choked on a gummy worm. Nico's face went dangerously blank. ""You \*asked\* him that?""

""Not in those \*exact\* words,"" Hazel said, kicking Will's shin under the table. He yelped, rubbing his leg with exaggerated pain. ""But yeah. Had to be sure."" She leaned forward, her gold eyes glinting. ""Turns out he's just stupidly in love with you. Which is \*almost\* worse.""

Will beamed. ""Aw, Hazel—""

""Don't."" She pointed a gummy worm at him like a tiny, gelatinous sword. ""I \*will\* reverse your healing powers.""

Nico groaned, flopping onto the couch between them. ""I leave for \*five minutes\*—""

""—and your girlfriend adopted me,"" Will finished, tossing an arm around Nico's shoulders.

Hazel's expression darkened. ""\*Girlfriend\*?""

Will froze. ""Uh. Platonic soulmate? Adopted sister? Terrifying guardian of Nico's honor?""

""Better,"" Hazel growled, flicking a gummy worm at his forehead.

Nico sighed, plucking the candy from Will's face and popping it into his mouth. ""You're both insufferable.""

Will grinned, pressing a kiss to Nico's temple. ""But you love us.""

Hazel fake-gagged, but Nico caught the tiny smile she tried to hide. ""Unfortunately,"" he muttered.

The door slammed open again. A harried-looking satyr stumbled in, panting. ""Uh. There's a \*thing\*—""

Hazel sighed. ""Gods \*damn it\*—""

Will perked up. ""Is it stab-worthy?""

Nico buried his face in his hands.

Hazel was already on her feet, spatha manifesting in her grip with a shimmer of mist. ""What kind of \*thing\*?"" she demanded, kicking the coffee table aside. Gummy worms scattered across the floor like colorful casualties.

The satyr—Hazel vaguely recognized him as one of the strawberry fields crew—waved his arms wildly. ""Like, \*hydra\* thing! But with \*

teeth\*? And it's eating the—""

Will was already halfway out the door, med pack slung over his shoulder. Nico grabbed his wrist. ""Don't you \*dare\* try to heal it.""

""Wouldn't dream of it, Sunshine."" Will winked, then yelped as Hazel body-checked him aside to storm into the sunlight first.

The scene outside was \*exactly\* the kind of chaos Hazel thrived in. The hydra—if you could call the writhing, six-headed monstrosity that—had cornered a group of terrified campers by the canoe lake. One head was busy chewing on a canoe paddle, another regurgitating what looked like half-digested Hermes cabin socks.

Hazel cracked her knuckles. ""Alright, Solace. Pop quiz.""

Will groaned. ""Hazel, \*now\*?""

""First rule of Nico's boyfriend—"" Hazel flipped her spatha in a deadly arc, slicing through a hydra head that lunged too close. The stump sizzled, two more sprouting in its place. She didn't blink. ""—you fight \*smart\*.""

Will ducked a spray of acid, rolling to avoid the snapping jaws. ""I \*am\* a doctor!""

""Yeah? Then \*diagnose\* this."" She jerked her chin toward the hydra's underbelly—scales shimmering with an unnatural sheen, pulsing like a sick heartbeat. Will's grin faltered.

Nico materialized beside them, shadows licking at his boots. ""It's poisoned,"" he muttered. ""Someone \*fed\* it something.""

Hazel's stomach dropped. Poisoned monsters were Hades' territory—which meant this was a message. Her fingers tightened around her sword. ""Solace. Can you purify it?""

Will's eyes darted between the hydra's thrashing heads and Nico's tense shoulders. ""Maybe. But I'd need—""

""\*Time\*,"" Nico finished grimly. He raised a hand, and the earth shuddered. Skeletal warriors clawed their way from the soil, rusty swords gleaming. ""Buy him some.""

Hazel didn't wait. She charged, her blade a blur of gold and mist. The hydra screeched, three heads zeroing in on her. She grinned, wild and reckless. ""C'mon, \*boys\*!""

Behind her, Will's voice rose in a hymn to Apollo—clear and bright, cutting through the chaos. The air hummed with power.

One of the hydra's heads \*twitched\*, its pupils dilating. Hazel's breath caught. It was \*working\*.

Then the world exploded in green fire.

Hazel barely had time to roll before a hydra head crashed down where she'd been standing, its maw dripping venom that sizzled through the grass like acid. She came up spitting dirt, just in time to see Nico's skeletal warriors swarm the beast—only for two to dissolve instantly as another head belched noxious purple vapor.

""Will!"" Nico's voice cracked mid-shout. Hazel followed his gaze—Will had climbed onto the hydra's back, one hand gripping scales slick with poison, the other pressed against its thrashing neck as golden light pulsed from his palm. The hydra screamed, three heads whipping around to snap at him.

Hazel moved on instinct. She hurled her spatha like a javelin, impaling one head through the eye. It recoiled with a shriek, buying Will two seconds—just enough for Nico to shadow-travel up beside him, grabbing his belt to keep him from sliding off.

The remaining heads spasmed suddenly, their movements turning jerky. Will's glow intensified, sweat dripping down his temples as the hymn between his teeth shifted to something older, sharper. The hydra's scales began \*peeling\* like rotting fruit, revealing blackened flesh beneath.

Hazel yanked her sword free just as the ground trembled. A fissure split the earth beneath the hydra's belly—\*Nico's\* doing—and skeletal hands erupted upward, dragging the monster down. Will's light flared blinding white; Hazel had to look away.

When she blinked the spots from her vision, the hydra was gone. Only a smoldering crater remained, dotted with half-melted teeth.

Will collapsed against Nico, breathing hard. ""Told you... I could... purify it.""

Nico's hands shook where they gripped Will's shoulders. ""You \*idiot\*,"" he hissed, but there was no heat in it.

Hazel approached, kicking a charred hydra tooth aside. ""Not bad, Solace."" She wiped her blade clean on her jeans. ""For a healer.""

Will grinned weakly, still slumped in Nico's arms. ""Does this mean... I pass?""

Nico made a strangled noise. Hazel smirked, sheathing her sword. ""Eh. Provisional approval."" She nodded toward the crater. ""But next time? \*Less\* almost dying.""

Will's laugh turned into a cough. Nico's glare could've withered grapes.

""Infirmary,"" Nico growled, hauling Will upright with more force than necessary. His fingers dug into Will's ribs where the hydra's tail had clipped him - broken, but still able to be healed. Hazel watched them stagger toward the Big House, Nico's shadows lashing at his heels like agitated snakes.

Three hours later, the infirmary door slammed shut behind Nico hard enough to rattle the rafters. Hazel barely looked up from sharpening her spatha on the Hades cabin porch. ""He alive?""

""Barely."" Nico's voice was dangerously calm. He leaned against the railing, fingers white-knuckled on the wood. ""We need to talk.""

Hazel flicked the whetstone across the blade. ""About how your boyfriend's an idiot?""

""About how \*you\* almost got him killed."" Nico's head snapped up, eyes burning. ""What the \*hell\*, Hazel? Poisoned hydra? You \*knew\*—""

The whetstone screeched to a halt. Hazel's jaw tightened. ""I protected you.""

""By \*using\* him?"" Nico's laugh was jagged. ""He could've \*died\*—""

""He \*didn't\*."" Hazel stood abruptly, the chair scraping against the floorboards. ""And he proved himself. That's what matters.""

Nico's shadow stretched unnaturally long across the porch. ""Not like this."" His voice dropped. ""You don't get to—to \*test\* people by throwing them at monsters. Especially not him.""

Hazel's fingers twitched toward her sword hilt. ""Or what?""

The words hung between them, sharp as Stygian iron. Nico's expression softened, just for a second. ""Look, I get it. But Will's not—he's not some underworld recruit. You can't—""

""\*I can't?\*"" Hazel's voice cracked. Gold coins spilled from her pockets, clattering across the floor. ""After everything \*I've\* done—""

Nico reached for her. ""Hazel—""

She stepped back, mist already curling around her ankles. ""Tell \*him\* about boundaries,"" she spat. Then she dissolved into shadows, leaving Nico gripping empty air.

The underworld stank of pomegranates and regret. Hazel stormed past the startled spirits, her boots kicking up ashes from the Phlegethon's banks. Hades looked up from his paperwork, one eyebrow arched. ""Daughter. To what do I—""

""Fix Nico."" Hazel slammed her hands onto his obsidian desk, making the inkwell rattle. ""He's \*compromised\*.""

Hades sighed, setting down his pen. ""Ah. The Solace boy.""

Hazel's nails bit into her palms. ""You know about him?

Hades steepled his fingers, shadows pooling around his throne like liquid smoke. ""I know everything that happens in my domain, child. Including,"" his gaze flicked to the fresh scratches on Hazel's knuckles, ""reckless interventions.""

""This isn't a joke!"" Hazel's voice echoed through the throne room, scattering shades. ""Will \*healed\* a poisoned hydra today. Do you know what that means? Someone's targeting—""

""—my son,"" Hades finished dryly. He stood abruptly, his cloak billowing as he descended the obsidian steps. ""And you believe Apollo's whelp makes him weak.""

Hazel flinched. ""I didn't say—""

""You didn't have to."" Hades' cold fingers tilted her chin up. ""Tell me, daughter... when you resurrected that Imperial gold sword last month, did it make \*you\* weak? Or did it give you strength?""

The question hung between them, uncomfortably close to Nico's earlier words. Hazel jerked away. ""This is different. Will's—""

""—alive?"" Hades' smile didn't reach his eyes. ""Like your mother was?""

Hazel's breath hitched. The throne room's torches guttered, casting long shadows across the frescoed walls—depictions of Persephone's return, of pomegranate seeds glistening like blood.

""You think I don't understand?"" Hades murmured. ""You think I haven't watched every child of mine drown in the living?"" His hand hovered over Hazel's shoulder, not quite touching. ""But Nico has clawed his way back from worse than love.""

Hazel swallowed against the lump in her throat. ""He almost \*died\* today.""

""And you almost killed him yesterday."" Hades' voice softened. ""Yet here you stand—in my halls, not his. Tell me, Hazel Levesque... who exactly are you protecting?""

The floor seemed to tilt beneath her. Hazel stumbled back a step, her spatha clattering to the marble—she hadn't even realized she'd drawn it. Hades sighed, waving a hand. The weapon vanished into mist.

""Go home,"" he said, not unkindly. ""Before your brother does something reckless. Again.""

Hazel opened her mouth—

A skeletal hand burst from the floor, clutching a familiar orange camp necklace. Hazel's blood ran cold. ""That's—""

""—Will Solace's,"" Hades confirmed. He examined the beads with detached interest. ""How... unfortunate.""

The shadows swallowed Hazel before she could scream.

Nico stood frozen in the Hades cabin doorway, Will's stolen necklace dangling from his fingers like a broken promise. The skeletal hand had vanished, but the message was clear—Hades had intervened. \*Again\*.

Inside the infirmary, Will groaned weakly from his cot, bandages stark against his sun-kissed skin. Nico's throat tightened. He should be there—holding his hand, changing his dressings, murmuring stupid Apollo puns until Will groaned and threw a pillow at him. But Hazel—

The cabin door slammed open without warning. Hazel stood framed in moonlight, her golden eyes blazing. ""You \*idiot\*,"" she hissed.

Nico didn't flinch. ""You ran to Dad.""

""He \*took\* Will's necklace!"" Hazel's voice cracked. She stormed inside, kicking aside a pile of Nico's discarded hoodies. ""This is \*exactly\* what I warned you about—""

Nico's shadow lashed out, twisting around her wrist. ""No. This is what \*you\* caused."" He yanked her closer, their noses almost touching. ""You don't get to play judge and executioner with the people I love.""

Hazel bared her teeth. ""Even when it gets them \*killed\*?""

The shadows recoiled. Nico's breath hitched—because she wasn't wrong. The poisoned hydra, the skeletal messenger... Someone \*was\* targeting Will. Through \*him\*.

Hazel saw the realization dawn and pounced. ""You \*know\* I'm right. Hades \*knows\*—""

""Stop."" Nico's voice dropped to a whisper. ""Just... stop."" He pressed Will's necklace into her palm, the beads still warm from his grip. ""You want to protect me? \*Fine\*. But not like this.""

For a heartbeat, Hazel didn't move. Then her fingers curled around the necklace—and the floor split open beneath them.

Hades' throne room materialized in a swirl of smoke and pomegranate seeds. The god of the dead lounged on his obsidian throne, Will's necklace now looped carelessly around one skeletal finger.

""Children,"" he sighed. ""Must we \*always\* do this the hard way?""

Hazel lunged—but Nico was faster. His sword flashed, severing the necklace's cord before Hades could react. The beads scattered across the marble like fallen stars.

Hades raised an eyebrow. ""Interesting choice.""

Nico didn't smile. ""Try again,"" he said softly, ""and I'll bring down the \*entire\* underworld.""

Somewhere in the darkness, Persephone's laughter echoed like shattering glass.

Hades leaned forward, steepling his fingers. ""Prove it.""

Nico didn't hesitate. He drove his sword into the marble floor—cracks spiderwebbed outward, branching like lightning through the underworld's foundations. The throne room trembled. Somewhere in the distance, a chorus of shades wailed.

Hazel grabbed his arm. ""Nico—""

""\*Enough\*."" The word tore from Nico's throat, raw with power. Shadows exploded outward, swallowing the torches' light. The temperature plummeted. Frost crystallized along Hades' obsidian throne.

Will's necklace beads levitated mid-air, suspended in the sudden silence.

Hades exhaled—long, slow, almost impressed. ""Very well."" He flicked his wrist. The beads reassembled into a perfect circle, landing in Nico's palm with a quiet click. ""But mark this, son: love is a weakness your enemies \*will\* exploit.""

Nico clenched his fist around the necklace. The beads bit into his skin. ""Then let them try.""

Hades' laughter echoed through the collapsing throne room as the shadows swallowed them whole.

They reappeared in the infirmary doorway, the sudden sunlight making Hazel stagger. Will sat bolt upright in his cot, bandages askew. ""What the—\*Nico\*?"" His voice cracked on the name.

Nico crossed the room in three strides, pressing the necklace into Will's shaking hands. ""Don't take this off again.""

Will's fingers closed around the beads—then Nico's collar. He yanked him down into a crushing kiss. Hazel looked away, but not fast enough to miss the way Nico melted into it, his shoulders slumping like a puppet with cut strings.

When they broke apart, Will was grinning. ""So. Does this mean I'm officially—""

""Shut up,"" Nico muttered, pressing their foreheads together.

Hazel cleared her throat pointedly. Will blinked up at her, still breathless. ""Oh. Uh. Thanks? For not letting me die?""

Hazel rolled her eyes—but tossed him a gummy worm from her pocket. Will caught it mid-air, beaming.

Nico groaned. ""You're \*both\* insufferable.""

Will popped the candy into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully. ""So... does this mean I get the shovel talk \*after\* the near-death experiences now? Because I'd really like to establish some ground rules—""

Hazel's spatha manifested with a shimmer. Will yelped, ducking behind Nico.

Nico pinched the bridge of his nose. ""I'm surrounded by idiots.""

Outside, the dinner bell rang. Somewhere beyond the hills, the earth rumbled—but for now, the world held.

Hazel stared at her plate, the last fry wilting in a pool of ketchup. Nico had been silent for seventeen minutes straight—a record, even for him. Will was asleep upstairs, doped up on nectar and bad decisions.

""Look,"" Hazel said abruptly, shoving her plate aside. ""I'm sorry. For—all of it.""

Nico didn't lift his head. ""Which part?"" His voice was too light. ""The interrogation? The hydra? Or siccing our father on my boyfriend?""

Hazel's fingers twitched toward her sword hilt out of habit. ""The... overprotectiveness."" The word tasted like ash. ""I just—"" She exhaled sharply. ""I \*saw\* you die once, Nico. I'm not doing that again.""

Nico's shoulders stiffened. Then, in one fluid motion, he stood—and yanked her into a bone-crushing hug. Hazel froze, her nose smushed against his shoulder. He smelled like stale gummy worms and Stygian iron.

""It's fine,"" Nico muttered into her hair. His voice cracked. ""\*You're\* fine. Just—no more hydra tests, okay?""

Hazel snorted, her arms tightening around him. ""No promises."" She felt him roll his eyes.

Then Nico stepped back, ruffling her curls with deliberate obnoxiousness. ""McDonald's?""

Hazel blinked. ""What?""

""You heard me."" Nico's smirk was pure trouble. He extended a hand, shadows already coiling around his wrist. ""Dad's pissed. Will's unconscious. And I \*really\* need a McFlurry.""

Hazel eyed his palm. ""This is a terrible idea.""

""Obviously."" Nico wiggled his fingers impatiently. Shadows licked up his arm like living ink. ""But you're still holding my hand when we jump. Last time you 'forgot,' you ended up in a Taco Bell dumpster.""

Hazel swatted his palm but didn't let go. ""That was \*one time\*—"" 

The world dissolved into screaming darkness. For three heartbeats, Hazel's bones vibrated like tuning forks, her teeth rattling with the aftershocks of Nico's chaotic teleportation. Then fluorescent lights seared her retinas, the stench of deep-fry oil assaulted her nostrils, and Miley Cyrus's \*Wrecking Ball\* blared at earsplitting volume from the McDonald's speakers. 

Hazel staggered into a sticky booth, narrowly avoiding faceplanting into a puddle of congealed sweet-and-sour sauce. ""Gods, Nico—warn a girl before you rip her through the fabric of reality!""

Nico collapsed across from her, his sneakers squeaking against the floor's suspicious sheen. ""Where's the fun in that?"" He tossed a stolen Happy Meal toy—a disturbingly lumpy Grimace figurine—onto the table between them. ""Truce offering.""

Hazel eyed the purple blob. It grinned back with unsettling plastic cheer. ""This is cursed."" 

A tray slammed down beside them. Will stood swaying in hospital scrubs, his hair sticking up in sleep-mussed spikes, one arm still hooked to an IV drip he'd clearly yanked out. ""Did someone say 'McNuggets'?"" he slurred, then promptly face-planted into Nico's lap. 

Nico didn't even blink. ""Told you he'd follow the shadow trail."" He pried a ketchup packet from Will's death grip. ""He's like a golden retriever. But with more internal bleeding.""

Will chuckled, ""Alright Neeks, alright.""

Hazel watched Will mumble something incoherent into Nico's thighs. ""You're \*both\* disasters."" She snatched the IV bag dangling from Will's arm before it dripped onto her fries. ""Why is this man not in a coma?""

Nico shrugged, casually carding his fingers through Will's hair. ""Apollo kids bounce back fast. Also, one time he heard 'ice cream' and broke three medical restraining orders."" He paused. ""Allegedly.""

A fry sailed past Hazel's ear. She turned slowly to see a grinning preteen in a Hermes cabin shirt perched on the next booth. ""Yo, Death Kids! Heard you fought a radioactive hydra. Sick."" The kid tossed another fry. ""Can I have your autograph? For, uh... science."" 

""Why are you guys even here?"" Nico said annoyed.

""Same reason why your here, camp food sucks."" He said 

Then Nico's shadow lashed out, stealing the kid's milkshake mid-air. Hazel sighed, swiping a nugget from Will's unconscious stash. Somewhere behind the counter, a manager screamed about 'ghost fries.' 

The McDonald's lights flickered ominously. Hazel met Nico's eyes over Will's snoring form.

1q9qy2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1q9qy2s/the_psychology_of_instant_respect_strategies_to/,The Psychology of Instant Respect: Strategies to Help Earn It,"I’ve been studying charisma, social psychology, and honestly just observing people who command rooms without trying. Read everything from Cialdini's influence research to random evolutionary psych papers at 2am. Watched hours of interviews with people who just have it. Turns out most advice about earning respect is complete garbage.

The reality? Respect isn't earned through achievement or trying hard. It's triggered through specific psychological mechanisms most people accidentally sabotage. Here's what actually works:

**Stop seeking approval, it's killing your respect potential**

Sounds counterintuitive but research backs this up. When you're desperate for validation, people subconsciously register you as lower status. Their brain literally categorizes you differently. 

Robert Greene talks about this in The Laws of Human Nature (dude studied power dynamics for decades, the book won't shut up about historical figures but it's insanely good for understanding social hierarchy). He breaks down how neediness creates a ""respect repellent"" effect. 

The fix isn't fake confidence. It's genuinely caring less about any single person's opinion. When you're outcome independent, people feel it. They lean in instead of pulling back.

**Master the pause, control the room**

Fastest respect hack I've found. When someone asks you something, pause 2-3 seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it's uncomfortable as hell at first.

Why it works: quick responses signal anxiety or eagerness to please. Pauses signal you're actually thinking, that your words have weight. Obama does this constantly. So does every trial lawyer worth their salt.

**Fix your nonverbal communication**

Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed body language doesn't just communicate confidence, it literally creates it biochemically. Power poses increase testosterone and decrease cortisol.

But here's what most people miss: it's not about standing tall occasionally. It's about eliminating submissive tells. Stop:
• tilting your head when speaking
• using uptalk (ending statements like questions?)
• fidgeting or touching your face/neck
• making yourself physically smaller

The app Youper has this feature where you can practice recognizing your anxiety patterns. Helps you catch the physical manifestations before they become obvious to others. Way better than generic meditation apps.

**Become comfortable with conflict**

People respect those who can handle disagreement without getting emotional or defensive. This is probably the hardest one because we're wired to avoid conflict.

The Anatomy of Peace by the Arbinger Institute (legitimately one of the best books on human psychology,, uses this weird narrative format but the insights are completely game changing for understanding why conflicts escalate) breaks down how we create enemies in our minds and how that changes our entire approach.

When someone disagrees with you, try: ""interesting point, I see it differently because..."" instead of justifying or getting defensive. You're not trying to win, you're demonstrating you can hold your ground calmly.

**Strategic vulnerability beats fake perfection**

Research from Brené Brown shows calculated vulnerability increases respect and likability simultaneously. The key word is calculated. 

Sharing a past struggle you've overcome hits different than complaining about current problems. It shows growth and self awareness without seeming weak.

Lex Fridman's podcast is masterclass in this. He asks uncomfortable questions, admits when he doesn't know something, shares genuine thoughts. Somehow makes him more respected not less. The episode with Jocko Willink specifically covers how owning mistakes builds credibility.

**Develop actual expertise in something**

Cal Newport's research on deep work and skill development is pretty clear: surface level knowledge in many areas gets you nowhere. Depth in one area commands respect.

People can smell superficial knowledge instantly. But when you can go three levels deep on a topic, explain complex things simply, admit the limits of your knowledge, that's when respect happens automatically.

Doesn't matter what the expertise is. Could be coffee brewing, excel formulas, understanding dog behavior. Depth signals conscientiousness and intelligence.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio podcasts tailored to whatever skill you want to develop. Built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts, it generates adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, whether that's improving social dynamics, mastering conflict resolution, or going deep on any topic. 

You can customize each session from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples, and pick voices that actually keep you engaged (the sarcastic narrator option makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes). The app also has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can ask questions mid-podcast or chat with about your specific struggles, it'll recommend content based on its understanding of you. Covers all the books mentioned here plus thousands more, with fact-checked content so you're not getting AI hallucinations. Makes structured learning actually fit into a normal schedule without feeling like homework.

**The physical presence thing is real**

Uncomfortable truth: your physical presentation affects instant respect. Not about being attractive. It's about looking like you give a shit about yourself.

Basic hygiene obviously, but also: clothes that fit properly, posture, how you move through space. Taking up appropriate space (not shrinking, not overcompensating).

Hit the gym consistently not for aesthetics but because it changes how you carry yourself. Something shifts psychologically when you're physically capable. People register it subconsciously.

**Stop explaining yourself constantly**

Overexplaining signals insecurity. When you make a decision or state a preference, resist the urge to justify it unless specifically asked.

""I can't make it friday"" not ""I can't make it friday because I have this thing and also I'm really tired and...""

Atomic Habits by James Clear (this book is everywhere for a reason, completely changed how I think about behavior change and why we do what we do) talks about identity based habits. Start seeing yourself as someone who doesn't need to justify their choices. The behavior follows.

**ask better questions, talk way less**

People respect good listeners more than good talkers. But not passive listening, active questioning.

Instead of waiting for your turn to speak, get genuinely curious. Ask follow ups. ""What made you think that?"" ""How'd you figure that out?"" 

Chris Voss's Never Split the Difference breaks down FBI hostage negotiation tactics that apply to normal conversation. Tactical empathy and mirroring build instant rapport and respect. The calibrated questions technique alone is worth the read.

**Embrace the uncomfortable truth**

Respect happens when people feel you're operating from your own internal compass, not seeking their approval or following scripts. It's triggered by congruence between your words, actions, and energy.

Most of this isn't about tricks. It's about genuine self development that manifests externally. The psychology is just understanding why certain behaviors trigger certain responses. 

Nobody respects someone trying desperately to be respected. They respect someone who respects themselves enough to not need it from them.",2,1768109131.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

One side is a coffee shop, and the other side is a gay bar. The locals have lovingly named the coffee shop ""the queer café"". Picture a modern-day speakeasy situation and that's it. The club itself is pretty nondescript, but to get in you have to enter the coffee shop, then go through a giant pink wardrobe. 

I'd like to give them each a name that fits together well. For example, I once went to a coffee shop called ""The Golden Boy"" that was attached to a bar called ""The Golden Girl"". I liked that it was sort of a casual reference, nothing too crazy or too cheesy.

I’m a good boyfriend


I know what people think of me.
 They think I’m broken. Or dangerous.
They don’t understand.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

I first saw her outside the pharmacy on Oak Street.
 She was carrying a paper bag and scrolling through her phone. She bumped into someone, dropped her receipt.
 I picked it up for her.
She smiled.
 Just a little smile.
 But it stayed with me.
It meant something.
 It had to.
I trailed her home that evening.
 Not to be creepy — just to make sure she got there safe.
 She walked with music in her ears, barely looking around. So unaware.
 Anyone could’ve hurt her.
 She needed someone to look after her.
That’s what boyfriends do.

Her name was Madison.
 I learned that from the label on her pharmacy bag.
 Madison Grey.
Nice name.
 Clean.
 Warm.
She lived in a little brick townhouse near the park.
 Unit 4B.
 I walked past it three times that night. The curtains were closed, but the lights were on.
 She was home.
 Safe.
That should’ve been enough.
 But it wasn’t.

At first, I only watched from across the street.
 A car. A bench. A shadow.
She always kept the same routine. Work, coffee shop, home.
 She’d heat up microwave dinners and binge true crime shows.
 Ironically.
On Tuesdays she watered her plants.
 On Thursdays she did laundry.
 On Sundays she took long showers and sang to herself.
I liked that.
 That was ours.
 She just didn’t know it yet.

I broke in for the first time a few weeks later.
She left for work at 8:15 sharp.
 Took a Lyft. Didn’t lock the window.
 That wasn’t safe.
I didn’t take anything.
 Didn’t mess anything up.
 I just wanted to look around.
Her couch was soft. Her throw blanket smelled like lavender.
 I sat for a while. Imagined her curled up next to me.
 Watched a few minutes of her show before I left.
It felt right.
 Like I belonged there.

Eventually, I stopped leaving.
I’d be inside when she got home, tucked behind furniture or crouched in closets.
 She never noticed.
Sometimes, I’d crawl under her bed and listen to her breathing.
 Other times I hid in the kitchen cabinet.
 Once, I fell asleep inside her laundry hamper.
She walked right past me, brushing her teeth, humming her little songs.
She was beautiful.
 Radiant.
 Mine.

There were close calls.
 Once she paused mid-step, sniffing the air.
 Another time she stared too long at the half-used coffee cup I’d forgotten in the sink.
She mumbled, “Weird...” and kept moving.
She never really saw me.
 But I saw her.
 Every inch.
I watched her stretch before bed.
 Read on the toilet.
 I knew which side she parted her hair. Which lotion she liked. What time she scratched her thigh in her sleep.
I knew her.
 Intimately.

I started leaving her little things.
 A rose on the nightstand.
 A chocolate on her pillow.
 One morning, I laid out her favorite sweater and leggings. She wore them.
That meant something.

The accident happened on a Tuesday.
 The last Tuesday.
I was cooking dinner — chicken parmesan. I’d set the table.
 Candles. Napkins.
 Two plates.
I was so excited to finally introduce myself.
She came home early.
 Walked in, dropped her purse, and froze.
 Eyes locked on mine.
“Who the f— WHAT THE FUCK?!”
I smiled.
 Held up the plate.
 “I made your favorite.”
She screamed.
 Grabbed a lamp. Threw it at me.
I tried to calm her down. I told her I loved her. That I’d been here for weeks. That I knew her.
She ran for the door.
 I chased her.
 I grabbed her arm.
She slipped.
Her head hit the corner of the countertop.
 Hard.
The sound was horrible.
 Like cracking a frozen watermelon.

She didn’t move.
Blood leaked from her temple, down her cheek, into her ear.
 Her eyes were open.
I froze.
 Stared.
 Tried to lift her up. She was heavier than I expected.
I carried her to bed.
 Tucked her in.
 Whispered that everything would be okay.
 That we were just having a fight.
She’d get over it.
 She’d always been so quiet anyway.
I kissed her cheek.
 Still warm.

She didn’t eat for days.
 Didn’t speak.
I read to her.
 Brushed her hair.
 Told her jokes.
But she just lay there.
 Still.
 Silent.
She must’ve been mad.

The smell started on day five.
I sprayed her with perfume. Lit candles.
 Opened windows.
At night, I’d curl up beside her.
 I didn’t mind the cold.
 Love keeps you warm.
I told her about my day. About the shows I watched.
 I told her I forgave her for screaming.
 She didn’t know what she was doing.
 People panic when they’re overwhelmed by love.

One morning, I woke up to find her hand had fallen off the bed.
 Stiff.
 Blackened fingers.
I gently tucked it back under the covers.
I told her she needed to rest.
 That she looked tired.
She didn’t blink.

Eventually, I knew it had to end.
 Even the best relationships can go sour.
I told her I was leaving.
 That I’d always remember her.
She didn’t say anything.
But her jaw had been open for days.
 So maybe she was trying.

I packed my things and left the next morning.
 Walked home.
 Turned on the TV.
And there she was.
Madison Grey. 29 years old.
 Found dead in her apartment.
They said there were no signs of forced entry. No witnesses.
 A photo of her smiling filled the screen.
 God, she looked beautiful.
The reporter called it a tragedy.
 Said the killer was still out there.
I sat on the couch.
 Shaking my head.
“This world,” I muttered. “This world is full of sick people.”
I looked at her face again.
“If I had stayed… maybe I could’ve intervened. Maybe… you wouldn’t have gotten killed.”
I wiped a tear from my cheek.
 “But it’s too late now. And even though I’ll always remember you…”
I smiled.
“I found someone new.”

Her name is Amy.
 She works at the coffee shop near my building.
She smiled when I ordered.
 Her nametag was crooked, so I fixed it for her.
She laughed.
 Said “Thanks.”
That meant something.
 It has to.
I know what people think of me.
 But they don’t understand.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

I saw Amy again today.
 She made me a cappuccino. Drew a little heart in the foam.
That meant something.
 It always does.
She smiled when I said her name — “Amy” — like it surprised her that I knew.
 I told her I noticed it on her name tag.
 She laughed and said, “You’ve got good eyes.”
I do.
 That’s how I found Madison.
I don’t talk about Madison anymore.
 People get upset when you live in the past.
 But sometimes I still think I hear her in my apartment.
 Dripping.
 Dragging.
 Breathing too slow.
It’s nothing.
 Just grief.
 It’s normal.

I started following Amy after work.
She always walks. Always the same route. She takes her earbuds out when crossing the street — safety girl. Smart girl.
She lives in a high-rise near the freeway. 6th floor.
 Lots of windows.
 But she never shuts the blinds.
That’s how I knew she wanted someone to see her.
 To understand her.

She eats pasta three times a week.
 Drinks red wine alone.
 Watches reruns of sitcoms and laughs at the wrong parts.
She’s lonely.
 I can feel it.
I leave little notes on her doorstep now.
 Not in my handwriting, of course. I use cut-up letters from magazines like in those old ransom movies.
But I don’t ask for anything.
 I just tell her things like,
 “You have a beautiful laugh.”
 or
 “You’re stronger than you think.”
I’m building trust.
 Slowly.
 Like with Madison.
But this time, it’s different.
 This time, I feel like someone’s watching me too.

I stayed overnight for the first time last Thursday.
 She left her window cracked open just enough.
I slipped in around midnight.
 She was asleep, wrapped up like a burrito, facing the wall.
Her apartment smells like peaches.
 I sat in the armchair and watched her breathe.
 Counted every inhale. Every exhale.
 Felt like music.
She made a soft noise in her sleep. A whimper.
 I almost got up to hold her.
 But I didn’t want to wake her.
I’m not rude.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

The next morning, she looked tired.
 Bags under her eyes.
 Kept looking over her shoulder on the walk to work.
She’s sensitive.
 That’s okay.
 Some people feel love more intensely than others.

Later that night, I snuck into her bathroom while she showered.
 Steam filled the mirror. I didn’t say a word. Just stood behind the curtain.
 Listened.
She sang the same three notes over and over. Off-key.
 Like a child’s lullaby.
 Just like Madison used to.
It made my stomach turn.
 Not with fear.
 With… memory.
Something felt wrong.
 Like I had already done this.
When she pulled the curtain open, I was gone.
 But I swear — for a second — she looked directly where I had stood.
Right into the empty space.
 Right into me.

I went home that night and turned on the TV.
There was no news.
 Just static.
Then… a commercial.
 Madison’s face.
 Mouth open. Skin waxy.
She was smiling.
 Too wide.
 Like someone had cut the corners of her mouth.
The screen said:
 “I MISSED YOU.”
And then:
 “DOES SHE KNOW WHAT YOU DID?”

I turned off the TV.
 Sat in the dark.
 Hands over my ears.
It’s just guilt.
 It’s just stress.
 It’s just…
The next morning, Amy had a nosebleed.
 She wiped it with her wrist and said, “Must be the dry air.”
 Then she stared past me — even though I wasn’t standing there.
She looked right through me.

That night, I saw something outside her window.
A figure.
 Human shape, but all wrong.
 Too long. Too thin.
 It stood on the fire escape, watching her.
Watching me.
I blinked. It was gone.
But when I turned around, her bedroom light was on.
 Even though she had gone to bed hours ago.
And there was a message written in fog on the window:
“SHE’S MINE.”

I don’t sleep much anymore.
I started keeping Amy`s toothbrush.
 I keep it under my pillow.
It makes me feel safe.

Amy’s cat was found dead on her balcony.
 No blood.
 No wounds.
 Just stretched like something had unraveled it from the inside.
She cried all morning.
 I watched from across the street.
I wanted to comfort her.
 To hold her.
But I also wondered…
Was that a warning?
 For me?

I think Madison is angry.
 But not about the accident.
 About Amy.
She doesn’t want me to move on.
 She keeps sending me things.
The other night, I found her eye in my fridge.
 Just sitting in the butter tray.
 Blinking.
It blinked at me.

I keep seeing her.
 In reflections.
 In shadows.
 In Amy’s expressions.
She’s changing.
Amy.
She stopped wearing makeup.
 Stopped brushing her hair.
 Her voice is lower now.
 Hungrier.
Last night, she whispered while she slept.
“Don’t leave me again.”

I think… I think Amy might be Madison now.
 Or maybe Madison was never real.
 Or maybe I’ve always been in love with someone else entirely.
Someone who exists between people.
 Inside them.
 Through them.

I can’t break up with her.
 Not this time.
 She won’t let me.
And I don’t want to.
 Not really.
 Not when she’s finally starting to understand me.
She left her door unlocked tonight.
 Just like Madison once did.
 Just like she wanted me to.
That means something.
 It always does.

I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.
 And good boyfriends…
 Never leave.


Amy hasn’t looked at me in days.
 Not really.
She used to glance toward the coffee shop door when it opened, like she was hoping I’d come in.
 Now she just stares at her register. Avoids eye contact. Fakes small talk.
I think she’s scared.
But not of me.
 No.
 I think she’s scared of how much she loves me.
Madison was the same way.
 At first.

I haven’t gone inside Amy’s apartment in weeks.
 Not since the cat.
Not since she left her door wide open and sat on her couch like she wanted me to come in, but then screamed and called the cops.
I didn't do anything.
 I stood in the hallway with flowers.
 Just stood there.
 She never even thanked me for them.
The cops showed up 12 minutes later.
 I timed it.
I told them I was her neighbor and got worried when I heard a scream.
 They believed me.
Because I’m calm.
 I’m collected.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

Since then, I’ve been careful.
 No more break-ins.
 No more notes.
I just watch now.
Sometimes through her blinds.
 Sometimes from my car.
I keep a logbook.
Monday 8:42 PM – She eats a granola bar and cries during reruns.


Wednesday 2:15 AM – She Googles “how to stop being watched.”


Friday 9:11 PM – She opens the door. Looks around. Says, “I know you’re out there.”


She doesn’t.
But I’m patient.
 I can wait.

I’ve been hearing things in my walls lately.
Scratching.
 Hollow tapping.
There’s a nest, maybe. Mice. Or rats.
Or maybe it’s nothing.
 Sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s real when you don’t sleep.
I haven’t slept in 11 days.
I just lie on the floor, hands over my ears, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Amy’s voice.
 How she sounded when she said, “Get the fuck away from me.”
She doesn’t mean that.
 She’s just confused.

I’ve started keeping her things.
 Little things.
 A used tissue from the trash.
 A straw from her coffee cup.
 A bandage she dropped when she scraped her elbow last week.
I keep them in a box under my bed.
 Right next to Madison’s toothbrush.
I talk to them sometimes.
 They’re the only ones who listen.

Yesterday, Amy told her friend she’s thinking of moving.
I heard it from the alley.
 They sat outside the cafe, whispering like I couldn’t hear them.
“She says she keeps waking up to stuff moved around,” the friend said. “Thinks someone’s been inside.”
 “She’s not paranoid,” Amy whispered. “I know he’s still watching me.”
She means me.
And that’s okay.
 At least she still thinks about me.

I followed her to her therapist’s office.
 Waited in the waiting room. Pretended I had an appointment too.
 Sat across from her. Didn’t say a word.
She didn’t look up.
 But her hand shook the whole time.
The therapist called her in.
 She stood up and dropped her pen.
 I picked it up.
Held it out.
 Smiled.
She stared at it like it was a snake.
 Took it without touching my hand.
 Whispered, “Why won’t you leave me alone?”
I didn’t say anything.
 She wouldn’t have believed me if I told her.
That I’m not here to hurt her.
 That I love her.
 That I’m not like the others.
I’m a good boyfriend.

I started sleeping under her apartment again.
 There’s a crawlspace through the maintenance closet. I cleaned it up. Made it comfortable.
I can hear her walking.
 Crying.
 Pacing.
Sometimes she talks to herself.
 Sometimes she talks to me.
At least I think she’s talking to me.

Last night, I dreamt I was inside her skin.
 Like wearing a hoodie made of her.
I walked around her apartment, touched everything she touched. Ate from her bowl. Sat on her couch.
 Then I looked in the mirror.
It wasn’t Amy’s face.
 It was Madison’s.
She was smiling.

I woke up screaming.
 Hands shaking.
 Teeth grinding.
I scratched at my chest until I bled.
 Just to feel something.

I went to the cafe this morning.
 Amy wasn’t there.
Her manager said she quit.
 No forwarding address.
 No warning.
She’s gone.

I walked outside.
 Looked up at her window.
 Empty.
No light.
 No shadow.
Just me, alone on the sidewalk.
I waited there until sundown.
 Then midnight.
 Then sunrise.
No one came out.
 No one went in.
I think she left me.

I cried on the floor of the crawlspace for hours.
 Punched the wall.
 Screamed into my palms.
I was good to her.
 I watched her. Protected her.
 Gave her everything.
Just like I did with Madison.
And like Madison… she ran.

It’s okay.
 I’m okay.
There’s a new girl now.
She rides the same bus every morning. Always takes the same seat. Left side, third row from the back.
 She reads romance novels and laughs quietly to herself.
This morning, she wore a sunflower pin in her hair.
I told her I liked it.
She smiled.
 Said, “Thanks.”
That means something.
 It always does.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.
 And this time, I’ll do it right.
 She’ll see.
 They all will.

She smiled.
 Said, “Thanks.”
That means something.
 It always does.
Her name is Emily.
 I heard the bus driver say it once — “Have a good day, Emily.”
 She smiled at him too.
She smiles at a lot of people.
 But not the same way.
Her smile for me was longer.
 Slower.
 Grateful.
The kind of smile you give someone who’s about to change your life.

Emily is different.
 She hums to herself when she reads.
 She draws little flowers on the margins of her books.
 She doesn’t rush.
She lives alone in a gray house near the overpass.
 Third from the end.
 White curtains. Bird feeder out front.
I watched her feed the birds once.
 Tiny brown finches.
She looked so proud of herself, standing there in her robe, clutching a coffee cup with chipped pink nail polish.
She has kind hands.
 Even her fingers move gently.
The first time I followed her home, I stepped on a twig and she turned.
 Our eyes met for a moment.
She didn’t scream.
 She didn’t say anything.
 She just… stared.
Then she went inside.
That’s when I knew.
 She was different.

This time, I took it slow.
 Measured. Precise.
I kept my distance.
 Watched through windows.
 Listened through vents.
I didn’t go inside for a full month.
 I waited until I knew her.
 Her rhythms. Her moods. Her soul.
She writes in a journal every night before bed.
 I watched her scribble through the blinds, eyebrows furrowed.
 Some nights, she cries after.
 Wipes her face. Lights a candle.
 Holds something close to her chest.
Maybe a photo.
 Maybe a memory.

I found her journal eventually.
 She hid it under a loose floorboard near her bed.
 It smelled like lavender and graphite.
I only read a few pages.
 Didn’t want to invade her too much.
She writes about her mother.
 About loss.
 About loneliness.
She doesn’t mention me.
 Not yet.
 But she will.

One night, I left her a gift.
Just a single page from a book.
 Pressed flat with a flower.
 Slid gently under her front door.
It was a love poem.
 One about being seen.
I didn’t sign it.
 She’d know.
 She’d feel it.

The next morning, I watched her find it.
 She picked it up slowly.
 Read it.
 Read it again.
She looked outside.
 Straight ahead.
 Not toward me.
But her lips moved.
She whispered something.
 Too soft to hear.
 Might’ve been “thank you.”

That was the first time I slept peacefully in months.

I started staying inside while she was gone.
 Just for an hour.
 Then two.
 Then a whole afternoon.
I didn’t touch much.
 Didn’t move anything.
Just… absorbed.
 Soaked in her scent.
 Laid on her couch.
Sometimes I’d nap with her blanket over my legs.
She smelled like cinnamon and old books.
 Like a memory you forgot you missed.

But something changed.
 Not with her — with me.
I stopped watching her to learn about her.
 I started watching her to check if she noticed me.
 If she said my name out loud.
 If she looked over her shoulder like Amy did.
But she didn’t.
She just lived.
 Alone.
 Happy.
And it hurt.
 More than it should have.

I started leaving more gifts.
A necklace I found in a thrift store.


A drawing of her I made from memory.


A box of tea I saw her buy once.


All anonymous.
 All placed carefully where she’d find them.
She started locking her windows.
 Installing cameras.
 Putting up motion lights.
She was scared.
 But not in the right way.
 Not in the romantic way.
She didn’t understand.

One night, I walked past her window and saw her on the phone.
She was crying.
 Saying things like,
 “I can’t do this again.”
 and
 “I don’t want to move.”
I froze.
 Back against the wall.
She looked toward the window, lips trembling.
I think she felt me.
 Even through the glass.
 Even in the dark.

I stayed away for two weeks.
 Didn’t watch.
 Didn’t listen.
 Didn’t breathe.
I wanted her to miss me.
 To realize how empty the world feels without someone who really sees you.
But when I came back, her house was different.
 Colder.
Curtains closed.
 Lights off early.
 Journal gone.
She was closing off.

I broke in again.
 Late.
 Quiet.
 Careful.
Her bedroom door was locked.
 She’d never locked it before.
I stood outside it, hand on the knob.
 Listened.
No sound.
 Just breathing.
Then — something strange.
 A whisper.
My name.
 Not out loud — but in my head.
Like her voice was behind my eyes.
“You’re not real.”

I opened the door.
She was awake.
 Sitting up.
 Waiting.
She didn’t scream.
She just said,
 “Who are you really?”

I didn’t answer.
 I couldn’t.
No one had ever asked that.
 Not even Madison.
 Not even Amy.
I stood there, trembling.
 She watched me like a mirror.
 Like she already knew.
“Do you even know your name?” she asked.

And I realized I didn’t.
I don’t.

I ran.
 Didn’t grab anything.
 Didn’t shut the door.
Just ran.

That was three nights ago.
I haven’t eaten since.
 I’ve been writing this down in pieces, in stairwells and alleys and dark motel bathrooms.
Trying to remember who I was before her.
 Before all of them.
But it’s all fading.
Madison.
 Amy.
 Emily.
Did I love them?
 Did they love me?
Or did I make them up?

Last night I had a dream.
 I was inside a cold room.
 Gray walls. One door. No handle.
Emily was there.
 Sitting cross-legged on the floor.
She looked up at me and said,
 “You were never a good boyfriend.
 You were just lonely.”
Then she opened her mouth —
 and Madison’s voice came out.
Then Amy’s.
 Then my own.
All saying the same thing:
“There is no her. There is only you.”

I woke up screaming.
 Blood under my nails.
 Scratches on my arms.
There was a mirror beside the bed.
I walked to it slowly.
 Looked in.
The man staring back didn’t blink.
 Didn’t breathe.
He just smiled.
And for a second,
 I almost believed
 I was real.

But I have a plan.
There’s a girl at the library.
 She’s new.
 She wears her hair like Madison.
 Laughs like Amy.
 Writes like Emily.
She dropped her bookmark today.
 I picked it up.
 Handed it to her.
She smiled.
 Said, “Thanks.”
That means something.
 It always does.

I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.
Even if I’m the only one who remembers that.


Her name is Felicia.
 She reads the same books I do.
 Leaves notes in the margins.
 She writes little questions in pencil — like she wants someone to talk to her.
I do.
 I always answer.
I leave my replies when no one’s looking.
 And the next day — they’re gone.
 She reads them.
 She’s listening.
She looks at me like she knows me.
 Not like the others.
 Not like Madison. Or Amy. Or Emily.
Felicia looks at me like I’m already hers.

She smiled today when I handed her the bookmark she dropped.
 A pressed daisy between two laminated hearts.
 She said, “You remembered.”
Of course I did.
 I remember everything about her.

The library’s strange lately.
 The same man stands at the desk every day, writing nothing in a notebook.
 The same clock on the wall is always stuck at 3:14.
 The lights flicker when I speak.
But Felicia?
 She’s real.
 She feels like gravity.

We started walking together after sunset.
 She always meets me by the fence.
 We don’t talk much.
 But her shoulder brushes mine sometimes.
 She doesn’t pull away.
Once, I told her about Amy.
She asked,
 “What did she say when you told her how you felt?”
I paused.
 I couldn’t remember.
 Did I ever say it?
Felicia touched my arm.
 “It’s okay,” she said.
 “You’ve been through a lot.”

Yesterday, she said something strange.
“We need to leave this place.”
I laughed.
 Said, “You mean this town?”
She looked at me, confused.
 “No. This place. The facility. Mr. Bauman’s watching us.”
The name chilled me.
 I didn’t know why.
“Who’s that?” I asked.
She looked around.
 “Just... trust me. He hears through the vents.”
I nodded, even though I didn’t understand.

We’ve been planning it now.
 Our escape.
 She says the east gate is only unlocked for ten minutes a day during med delivery.
 We’ll slip out then.
I asked why she wants to leave.
She looked at me, then said,
 “Because I finally found someone who sees me.”

Last night, I had a dream.
 I was in a white room.
 Bare walls. Fluorescent lights.
 A clipboard on the bed with my name on it.
Except…
 It wasn’t my name.
 It said “Patient 113 – B. Halvorsen.”
I woke up with blood under my fingernails.
 I don’t remember scratching.

Felicia came to me crying this morning.
 She said, “They’re transferring me.”
 Said she’s not allowed to see me anymore.
I didn’t understand.
 We’re not doing anything wrong.
 We’re in love.
She gripped my hands hard.
 Too hard.
 Tears in her eyes.
“You can’t forget,” she said.
 “They’ll try to wipe it all out again.”
Again?
“What do you mean again?” I asked.
She stared at me like I was breaking her heart.
 “You’ve done this before. With Madison. With Amy. With Emily. And you always forget.”
I felt the air go cold.
 Felt the words press in from the walls.
She leaned in and whispered,
 “This place... it’s not what you think. You never left. You’ve never left.”

I don’t remember getting sedated.
 I just remember waking up in a new room.
 Smaller.
 Grayer.
 No windows.
A man stands outside the door, scribbling on a clipboard.
 Mr. Bauman.
 I recognize him now.
He’s not a neighbor.
 He’s not a stranger.
 He’s my doctor.

And I remember the truth.
Madison wasn’t my girlfriend.
 She was my therapist.
 Amy too.
 Emily.
One by one, they came into my life — not because I loved them —
 but because they were assigned to treat me.
And one by one…
 they left.
Not because they didn’t understand me.
 Because I made them afraid.
Because I watched them.
 Wrote about them.
 Followed them.
Because I thought I was in love.
 But I was just sick.

I’m reading my own journal now.
 The first entry says:
“Progress is slow. Still detached from reality. Believes past psychiatrists were romantic partners. Exhibits delusions of love, persecution, and identity.
Refers to self as ‘a good boyfriend.’
Monitored under full-time psychiatric hold. No release scheduled.”

Felicia’s page is newer.
 She wrote:
“Patient 113 is intelligent. Kind when calm. Has creative potential.
 I see something good in him.
 I believe he’s more than his illness.
Maybe, with time… he could be someone I’d care for.
I shouldn’t write that.
I’m transferring soon. I’ll miss him.”

I sit on the bed now.
 No pen.
 No paper.
Just the memory of a girl who smiled when I handed her a bookmark.
The memory of a daisy.
 Of a library.
 Of someone who — for a moment — really saw me.
And maybe…
 maybe she wasn’t like the others.
Maybe she meant it.
 Even if I’ll never know.

They’re coming now.
 Mr. Bauman has the needle.
I close my eyes.
 Breathe deep.
I know what they think.
 What they’ve always thought.
But they don’t understand.
 They never did.

I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

I'm (29F) at my wit's end with my partner (30M) not helping out with the housework. We have been together 2 years and I don't feel like I'm expecting too much. Sometimes I work weekends while he is off and when I get home not only have the washing machine and dishwasher not been emptied but there has been no attempt to clean up after himself. There are chocolate wrappers, dirty dishes and takeout rubbish scattered all over the kitchen, table and couch,bedsheets askew, dirty clothes on the bedroom floor. He's always wanting me to come 4wding or fishing after I get home but I tell him I want to relax and get the place cleaned up first. He will then go wash the car or mow the lawn while i clean up his mess from the day plus finish off chores from the evening before/morning of. The other day I cleaned the whole house ready for his parents to visit and the last thing left was to put away the vaccuum which I asked him to do as he was standing in the doorway, i was met with the response ""well, you used it last"", another time i had my hands full and asked him to take the bin out and he said ""you've got two feet and a heatbeat"". It really makes me feel deflated and like asking him to do one thing is more trouble than its worth. I've spoken to him about these comments and he says he is just trying to ""lighten the mood"" but if he would help a little bit then the mood wouldn't need lightening. In the past I have asked about him helping out more and been met with the reasoning that im the one that wants chores done so therefore I should be the one to do them like he would just be happy to live in his own filth. Today he said he would stay behind while I went food shopping ""so he doesn't get in the way"" and I asked if he would bring the washing in while im out so I don't have to when I get home but when I come home he is taking a nap and the washing is still on the line. I feel like everything is on my plate to handle and its not fair, i get up early and make him coffee and sandwiches in the mornings before he goes to work and handle dinner plans, cooking, washing and cleaning too.

1q9qpq2,https://i.redd.it/02y87y51mncg1.jpeg,Sourdough Cinnamon Brown Sugar Scones,"This is my first post here, so hopefully I’m doing this correctly. I got into sourdough like half the world did during covid. I don’t do as often now as the first two years - now it’s mostly sourdough discard English muffins to which I’ve become addicted and are given as Christmas gifts every to co-workers - but one Sunday a month my husband asks me to make something for his Sunday school class. Tomorrow is THAT Sunday, and he has once again requested these nummy little treats. (Sometimes I add chocolate chip morsels. Oh, my! 😋) 

I found this recipe on the internet, and it’s become a favorite and much requested item. I’ve copied and pasted from Molly LaFontaine’s website and included the link, and it includes her note about her starter hydration. 

***Sourdough Cinnamon Brown Sugar Scones***

*Molly LaFontaine*

*These sourdough cinnamon brown sugar scones may just be one of the most nostalgic and delicious scones you'll ever eat. Each bite tastes like a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch cereal, but better. When you enjoy one of these scones with a hot cup of coffee, you'll see why they've become one of our all-time favorites!*

*INGREDIENTS*

*Scones*

*\* 2 cups all-purpose flour*

*\* 3/4 cup brown sugar not packed in the measuring cup*

*\* 1/2 tsp salt*

*\* 1 tsp ground cinnamon*

*\* 2 tsp baking powder*

*\* 1/2 cup cold stick butter not margarine*

*\* 1/4 cup milk or buttermilk*

*\* 1/2 cup sourdough starter (fed or discard) (! needs to be thick, not runny)*

*\* 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract*

*\* 1 egg*

*Topping*

*\* 1/2 Tbsp butter melted*

*\* 2 Tbsp brown sugar*

*\* 1/4 tsp cinnamon*

*INSTRUCTIONS*

* *

*1. Preheat the oven to 400°F and cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.* 

*2. Add flour, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Stir to combine.*

*3. Incorporate butter by using a cheese grater (large side) or cutting it into the mixture with a fork until pea-sized pieces form. Stir to evenly distribute butter pieces.*

*4. Add milk, sourdough starter (make sure your starter is thick and not runny!), vanilla, and egg. Mix gently using a spoon then use your hands to completely incorporate the rest of the flour.*

*5. IMPORTANT: Depending on the hydration and consistency of your sourdough starter, your dough may need a little more milk (2 Tbsp - 1/4 cup). Add this only if the dough is too crumbly and won't come together.Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold the dough in half then in half again or until all excess scone mix is incorporated.*

*6. Shape dough into a 2-inch high, 6-inch diameter circle with the palms of your hands.*

*7. Slice dough into 8 pieces like a pie, placing them 2 inches apart on a parchment-lined sheet pan. (at this point you can continue the recipe or place the sheet pan in the fridge for up to 24 hours).*

*8. Continue the recipe by melting 1/2 Tbsp butter for the topping and brush it on top of the scones.*

*9. In a small bowl stir together 2 Tbsp* *brown sugar and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture over the tops of the scones until it's all used up.*

*10. Bake for 18-20 minutes then place on a wire cooling rack. Enjoy!*

*NOTES*

*My Sourdough Recipes Disclaimer:*

*I regularly feed my sourdough starter a 2:1 ratio of unbleached flour to filtered water, this creates a 50% hydrated starter even when I use discard. If you feed your starter differently, results may vary due to a different hydration which will cause a different consistency.*

1q9qo77,https://www.reddit.com/r/thermodynamics/comments/1q9qo77/honestly_why_the_messy_room_analogy_for_entropy/,"Honestly, why the ""messy room"" analogy for Entropy kind of annoys me ?","I am a PhD student in physics and I have been thinking a lot lately about how we teach thermodynamics. We almost always start with the ""messy room"" analogy where we tell people that your room gets messy easily but takes work to clean, so that is entropy.

But does anyone else feel like this completely misses the point?

It makes it sound like simple clutter. It ignores the terrifying part which is that time itself is locked to this process. I was making coffee the other morning and poured too much cream in, and it hit me that the laws of physics technically say I should be able to unmix it if I reverse the particle velocities, but the universe just strictly forbids it. That feels way more heavy than just ""disorder"" or a messy room. It is about the arrow of time and the eventual heat death of everything. I feel like when we dumb it down to ""disorder"" we lose the actual beauty of the Second Law.

I actually just started a YouTube channel called ""Marsh Breaks It Down"" to try and explain these things without stripping away the existential dread. I made a video called ""Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee (Entropy Explained)"" where I tried to visualize this with a coffee cup instead of just equations.

I am curious how you guys prefer to visualize entropy. Do you stick to the statistical mechanics definition with microstates or do you think the ""disorder"" analogy is actually fine for beginners?

I added a voice toggle to shift the register of the wah, but otherwise it's the same sound.


For the enclosure, I had 3 things I wanted to try out:

- A 1590BB2 enclosure

- Staining with instant coffee

- Waterslide decals (believe it or not, I've never used one).


So here's how it went:

- The BB2 is only SLIGHTLY larger than a standard BB, the latter of which frustrates me with its short stature compared to a 125B.  This was SLIGHTLY less frustrating, but fitting the jacks over the pots was still fussy.  I had to shave some of the plastic housing off the input jack to get it past the pot.  Even though these are much wider than a 125B, I feel like I can't really fit much more in them because the height requires that jacks and pots not overlap at all.  

- I had an old stale jar of Cafe Bustelo that seemed past potability, so I decided to use it decorating pedals.  Got the idea from some paper crafting videos. I gave it a base coat of chalk paint, then some acrylic to brown it up a shade, then diluted mod podge, on which I sprinkled or pressed the coffee.  I wanted to go for an aged paper look and do some old west graphics, but ended up with something that looked like corroded electronics from a 1950s high school science lab.    So I leaned into that aesthetic with the water slides.  It does smell nice for a pedal.

- Yep, first time with waterslides.  They do work well, I'll certainly be done more waterslide graphics.  Kind of limiting not to be able to use white, of course.  I'll have to stick with lighter base coats I guess.  Probably no good on my tins.

we arrive on your beautiful island last week - we're so blown away by the beauty so far, in the kindness of your people but of the geography too. 

I was wondering if any of you could kindly share some tips for the below - we have just over a week left, and although I'm sure we're coming back - I'd love to make the most of our time here. We're not French speakers sadly (we're trying) but super interested in food culture (not fussyness), quiet and secluded beaches, beautiful hikes and challenging drives to interesting cultural points of interest. hope my list isn't too long - chip in what you can if you feel like it! 

• half day hikes (willing to drive, adventure into wilderness, medium difficulty) I've got Salazie pins (Folio House) 

• coastal walks 

• authentic creole cuisine, (I have La Source and L'Amberic) 

• any side of the road food (do you guys have fish fry culture here like we do in the Caribbean?) O Bon Grill came up, any good? 

• coffee tours, or roasters we should do. My partner hasn't been to a vanilla plantation before (any ones hidden away worth a drive) 

• non touristy markets? We did Saint Pierre yesterday! Trying my French 🤭 

• I'm celebrating a birthday here - any recommendations for what we could do. 

• ice cream - where can we find interesting local flavours? 

• arts charities or galleries (i am an artist to works with bagasse) we have FRAC and STella Matutina down already. 

Thanking you all so much in advance, I really think this might be the most beautiful place in the world, thanks for having us. ",2,1768107470.0,LaReunion,2,1.0,False

She's overall a good sleeper, a good eater, and a very happy baby, but for some reason the bed time routine only seems to wake her up more rather than get her ready to bed.

Our current routine: Final feed, diaper change and change into PJs, read her 1-2 books, put her in her sleep sack, dim the lights, and sing a song or two while rocking her to sleep. Except the song and rocking, instead of being a sweet transition to sleepy time, is like wrangling a crazed gremlin who's just drank 10 cups of coffee. She's squirmy, frustrated, spits her pacifier out every two seconds, tries to launch herself out of our arms - generally seems to be extremely resistant to the concept of bedtime. Last night it took over an hour of holding and rocking just to get her calm, and then easily another 30 minutes to get her close enough to sleep to put her in the crib.

Her sleep window at night is \~9PM - 8AM, during which she'll typically give us a 6-7 hour sleep stretch, feed once, and then (if we're lucky) go down for a few more hours before morning. During the day, she'll typically take 4 naps - \~2 hour in the late morning, \~1.5 hours in early afternoon, \~1.5 hours in the late afternoon, and then a 45 cat nap around dinner time to tide her over until bed time. If anything this final nap maybe doesn't seem like quite enough to tide her over to bedtime (she's yawning and grumpy after waking up), but this feels like a lot of daytime sleep already.

1q9qb7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1q9qb7c/foodie_report_focusing_on_mainly_fast_casual/,Foodie report focusing on mainly fast casual,"Hi everyone, we (family of 3, with a young child) just got back from a 6 day vacation in Maui and wanted to provided reviews for food spots. I am a big foodie from a food capital (Los Angeles) so eating good food is really important to me where ever we go.

A few comments on food overall:

1. Portion sizes are small compared to mainland US. We are small people and in Los Angeles, we typically split entrees. In Maui, most of the time every person in our family (including our 4 year old) had to have their own entrée in order to be adequately full.
2. Eating out is about $20-$25 an entrée whether we went to food trucks, fast casual or restaurants. I think this is the price food places think they can charge to the consumer. Seems to me that portion sizes are then set depending on how much the restaurant thinks can provide for that price. We ate out every meal 3x a day and spent about $65pp /day. Food is really expensive compared to LA, NY, SF.
3. We mainly ate fast casual because we didn't want our 4 year old daughter to wait for food or be disruptive in nice surroundings. There's so much fast casual and food trucks that serve high quality food. Don't feel like you need to go to Mama's Fish House (which we've been to on a prior trip and found to be unremarkable).

Day 1

Tin Roof (Kahului)- One of our favorites from our visit and really good value for Maui with a chicken and rice plate at $14. We ordered online after we landed and then picked up and ate it at the beach as this is a takeout place only. It wasn't that long of a wait, so next time, I'll order it when I've picked up the car. I'm inspired to pick up their cookbook. **10/10**

Miss Arepas (Lahaina) - great Venezuelan food. We got a beef arepas and a chicken and rice plate and sweet plaintains for dessert. All delicious. **8/10**

Day 2

Slappy Cakes (Lahaina)- A make your own pancake diner. We went here because we thought our 4 year old would like it. While the food was good, I think the value was low. A bottle of pancake batter, which made about 5 medium pancakes, was $10 and any toppings were $4. Given that the toppings were extra, I think that defeats the purpose of making your own pancakes because you can't really be that creative. We spent almost $100 here for 2 adults and a toddler on breakfast. **6/10 (poor value)**

Foodland (Lahaina) - we got poke at this grocery store due to all the raves. The fish did taste frozen but there were many varieties. I think its good value for what you get, but it can't compete with a bougie poke place -it remains supermarket poke. I did like all the Hawaiian foods at Foodland and their cool and affordable reusable grocery bags. **7/10**

Surfing Goat Dairy (Upcountry) - we got their chevre fresh goat cheese plate after their farm tour. The best goat cheese I've ever had; so good I bought several to bring home to LA even though its a PITA to bring back fresh food. The goat cheese is more like a thick ricotta than a tangy goat cheese you might be use to. The crackers they served with it were high quality. The people who own this dairy clearly are passionate about food. **10/10**

Ocean Vodka (Upcountry) - we ate at this distillery and restaurant right after Surfing Goat. If you can go here during sunset, I highly recommend as you can see the mountain and the sea from this idyllic spot. Make a reservation in advance for this hour. The food was just ok, kind of reminds me of BJ's chain. I thought it would be more bougie because it was a farm; but the food style is more like a bar. The pizza was very good though, like the best version of Domino's you can think of - gooey with low-moisture cheese and made with high quality pepperoni. I would come back here and order the pizza or sandwiches; don't order any fancy salads. **8/10 (extra point for the location)**

Day 3

Nalu (Kihei)- we stopped here after snorkeling and the line was out the door at 930am. Just drove off. So I can't review but I know many people love this place.

South Maui Gardens food pod (Kihei) - we went here after seeing how crowded Nalu was and we had the best meals of our trip. The South Maui Garden food pod was voted #1 food pod in Maui and it is so utterly beautiful. We ate breakfast at Bacon and Blossoms food truck and it was the best breakfast of my life! Ordered bacon, egg, potatoes plate as well as pancakes with bananas and macadamia nuts. They seem MAHA with rhetoric about cooking in beef tallow and never with seed oils - which I side-eyed. But the food shows a lot of attention to the quality of the ingredients. The bacon was thick cut and fatty, more like pork belly than the bacon you are used to. Also the portions were are similar to mainland; so we were able to share. The fine dining food truck Kitoko is located here (at the opposite end of food pod) and I really wished I could have tried it but we were there too early. If you are in the Wailea/Kihei area, you have to go to this food pod. **10/10**

Maui Fish Market (Kaanapali) - we ordered a macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and the kauai shrimp rice plates. Portions were soo tiny for $25 a plate, everyone was hungry afterwards but we didn't want to spend any more money. Perhaps I needed to have ordered the fish tacos or burritos.  **6/10**

Coconut Glens (Napili) - I read about how good this ice cream was on this forum but the original location is in Hana. Luckily, they opened up a new one in Napili. It was one of the best ice creams I've ever had, though I admit I am very partial to coconut. I don't understand the popularity of shaved ice with its artificial syrups. This is much better and vegan too (though so creamy - there is no tradeoffs with this ice cream). I loved the subtle sweetness and the pure flavors without any artificial ingredients. We had the original coconut flavor and the lilikoi, both fantastic. I wish I could replicate this ice cream at home, it was sublime. **11/10**

Honoapiilani Food Truck Park (Kaanapali) - this food truck pod has a lots of options though none of the trucks are that highly rated. I got the fish mango salad at the Thai Food by Suri and my husband got the pork sandwhich. Decent food. The pod could be a little nicer but things were clean enough. **7/10**

Day 4

Leoda's (Lahaina) - This place lives up to its reputation. We went here twice because the food is tasty and good value! On different occasions, we ordered the ahi tuna sandwich (big enough to share), the chicken pot pie, the chicken and waffles, and tomato bisque soup. All delicious. The rye bread on my ahi tuna sandwich was so fresh. The food is so rich that we didn't have room for pie, so that made me sad. Also there's a farmer's market right next door that sells all manner of Hawaiian snacks for you to bring home as souvenirs; my daughter loved the Maui Gummi Bears in particular. **10/10**

Paia Fish Market (Paia) - we got the salmon rice plate and the mahi mahi rice plate. The food is too greasy. I don't think it was bad, but nothing special **7/10**

McDonalds (Napili) - nothing special on their menu for Hawaii but the apple pies are fried. Mainland ended frying their apple pies decades ago and the current baked apple pies just can't compare. So I loved that bite of nostalgia. I hope McD always keeps their fried apple pies in HI, its a really treat to taste them again. **8/10**

Day 5

808 Grindz (Lahaina) - this is a breakfast food truck. We went here because the original cafe burnt down during the fires and we wanted to give it some business. Lahaina has not really recovered from the fires and I can't imagine the grief of those who livelihoods were destroyed. We had a breakfast plate with eggs, potatoes and sausage, crab latkes and pancakes. All solid. The people working the truck were really nice. **8/10**

Maui Ocean Center - this was the most disappointing part of our trip as tickets were $50 pp and the aquarium is quite small. It does have Dole Whip inside though, so if you are there, I'd recommend it.

Aloha Mixed Plate (Lahaina) - this was the only restaurant we went to during our entire trip. Its a nice place, right against the water but low-key and homey. I was not prepared for how unpretentious it was because the location was so beautiful. The food tastes like home-cooking, we got the mixed plate with chicken, korean beef and fish for $25. Loved it and would definitely come back. **9/10 (extra point for the location)**

We also went to a couple of coffee places and thought Akamai, run out of a food truck, was the best.

My family is dysfunctional as all hell, and I never felt so isolated in my life from my own people. My father doesn’t care about my feelings, my mother is bedridden and doesn’t remember me, and my sister doesn’t even talk to me because she hates everyone in the family. My friends are getting busier with work, and we don’t really talk anymore.

I’m NOT a bad person. 

I TRY to talk with them but everyone in my family is so jaded. I try to talk to my sister, ask her if something to her, anything to get under my skin, and she says no. I try to organize days with my friends, and I’m always the one asking if anyone is available. The love I am unable to give to my family (refuses to receive my love) goes to my coworker, who I treat to coffee and lunch sometimes, but as such, I grow broke. They never know that; I just like to see them smile, a “thank you”. Something to make me feel appreciated, human, wanted.

My girlfriend was my best friend and her loss from my life really ate away at my humanity. She said it wasn’t me. I know it wasn’t me. I gave her all of my love. All of my sweetness that I never was able to give to my family. But I can’t help but remember that date when she dumped me and how there felt like there was nothing left in her eyes. 

And it all broke me.

His tongue never even registered the taste as the sluggish brown liquid entered his mouth, finishing the cup's contents before returning it to where it was, making it his 15th one since he sat down for the day.

Seconds passed of the pitter-patter of clicks and taps echoing in the empty room, his room, a room dedicated to his dreams, his passion, and his career.

He is a writer, a storyteller, one whose work is read not by many but enough for him to continue.

A monotonous life he lives, but one he wishes to maintain.

At that moment, a different sound broke through, the familiar sound of a bell.

He stopped, his eyes followed the sound, and he saw the phone; he received a text. Picking it up, it was from his mother.

Opening the message, it read, ""It's your dad's birthday tomorrow, and unlike last time, everyone’s going to be here. It’s going to be a headache, but I’m sure we’ll push through anyway. See you tomorrow, as we planned.""

For a minute, he stared at those messages. After all, he was not the type to forget something so important. His dad's birthday was tomorrow, but he was unsure. He tried to recall the date, but nothing came to mind.

He was unprepared, something that had never happened before.

Still, he replied,"" Sure, Mom! See you tomorrow.”

After he pressed send, he slumped down, noting what to get his dad for his birthday the next day, but just as he was about to save it, his phone died.

Strange, he thought; he was sure there was still about half a battery left, but he didn't think much of it. Perhaps he had seen it incorrectly and instead plugged it in and placed it beside his work desk.

Next, his eyes caught a glimpse of the outside through his windows. He saw it was dark, and with the event coming out tomorrow, he decided to go to sleep rather than staying up late.

He stood up, stretched, and got out of his chair. His hands reached for the shutdown button, but as he did, his mind began to fill with thoughts. “You're almost finished. Why not continue?”

However, he ultimately decided against it and shut it down anyway.

He went to bed, and it seemed he was more tired than he thought, as the moment his head hit the pillow, his eyes grew heavier by the second.

﻿\*Blink\* his thought went to the story he was writing; it was almost finished, just finalizing the details, but it would have to wait, or should I...

\*Blink\* seems like the more he closed his eyes, the longer it took for them to open.

\*Blink\* …

Damn, he actually fell asleep. Well, let’s end the log here. I’ve taken enough for today.

I closed my eyes, and with a sudden pull, the ambient noise faded. Then, I was greeted by darkness, and the only sound was my own breathing.

Seconds passed. Or maybe longer.

Then light broke through as shifting pistons opened the hatch, and I was in.

It took a while for my vision to adjust; I never really got accustomed to it, even after making numerous attempts. Then the voice of a woman was heard.

""Hello, sir, good to see you awake. If you don't mind stepping out so we can check your production levels."" Greeted and ordered the woman.

As per routine, I followed.

Then, after I got out, she closed the pod, and seconds later, with a touch of the screen, a figure was displayed: 3%.

Just about right.

Before I mull it over, I felt the gaze of the woman who was now staring at me.

""If you keep this up, you're going to have to start over. There is a chance the host will collapse."" I miss the days when she said that with disappointment and a hint of anger; now it was just a reminder.

I just nodded at her words; she knew that much. There was nothing I could do; we are undersupplied.

Silence pervaded between us as I watched the woman work. Then she let me go with a note.

""It's going to take time to sort the amount of lost memory you harvested and ready it for formatting. Come back tomorrow. Thank you for your work. Your payment will be sent to your account.”

That should have been nice to hear, but now those thanks felt empty.

With nothing more to say, I just turned my back to get out as she continued to mess with the pod.

I wanted to go straight to my room to rest, but curiosity got the best of me, so I headed to the terminal to check how much they gave me.

And when I got there, it seemed I was not the only one. Someone got there before me, standing in front of one of the terminals. He took a glance in my direction, but his eyes went back to staring at the empty screen of the terminal.

I found it odd but proceeded to turn on one of them, entered my ID, and the moment I saw what I received, it stunned me.

It was more than I could have ever imagined, yet I had expected it. But after the adrenaline settled, I began to realize what those numbers represent. A twisting feeling slowly permeated my body as a weight so heavy began to settle, almost pinning me in my place as things started to run through my mind.

Then a voice broke it off. It was from the man.

""Good to know that there are still ones who think this is wrong, unlike those shits."" I was stunned, my eyes darted to his, but before I could ask, he turned and left. His words pounded in my head, and my vision now turned to the terminal, only to show a dark screen.

Now I did not see those numbers, but I saw myself, my eyes seem emptier than I remember. I wonder when they began to look like that.

I can’t remember how many harvests I made, or I choose not to. These eyes, I could still hide them back then, but nowadays I just let them be.

I was young when I started here, working as an assistant to the observers who took care of the harvesters, like the woman who greeted me earlier.

I used to be amazed at those pods.

Back then, all I knew was that the pods extracted Memory, real memory, lived memory, and converted it into something usable.

Once formatted, it could be stored, layered, and transferred directly into another mind.

The learning curve disappeared. The brain accepted it as its own.

I thought it was a miracle.

So when a position opened up for the harvesters, I applied without a thought.

I got accepted, after a while, I wanted to be transferred, but then I got paid.

A week more, I thought, then I’d be done, but still here I am, years later.

Though one thing has never left me, to this day, I still struggle to wrap my head around the things in the pods or simulations they mentioned.

I asked once, there had to be more to it. They couldn’t be just a simulation.

I was met with ridicule.

They told me they weren’t real, and that the sooner I accepted that, the more I could harvest.

So, I did. I treated it like a simulation.

Yet every assignment, every host that passed through my hands, slowly eroded that belief.

Standing here made my feet sore, and besides, I had had enough of looking at my reflection; it's not like it's going to change.

I went to my room to rest.

My only thought now is “Soon, soon I'll have enough to leave this place.”

By tomorrow, I was standing in front of the pod, and with a hiss, it opened, and as usual, I entered.

It closed once more, and my only accompaniment was the darkness and my breathing, and suddenly I found myself in this place, the home of the one I named the author.

He was still asleep, and only a few hours had passed. I left him there, and I went to his workroom. And without changing expression, I removed the plug from his phone, and using the pod functions, I drained whatever power the phone had, leaving it just as it was.

I turned on his computer next and then accessed the writing he was working on, leaving it open for him to see.

Now, the last part, I went to his room, and from his body, I cut off a memory. Then I woke him up.

He did so with a groggy expression, still in the clothes he had worn since yesterday. He stood, went to the kitchen, made another batch of coffee, and returned to his workroom.

His eyes showed a brief surprise when he saw his computer already on.

Must have forgotten to turn it off yesterday.

Nevertheless, he sat down and began to write. Time ticked on, minutes into hours, hours into midnight, and midnight into morning.

One hand reached for the cup of coffee beside the keyboard, while the other continued tapping.

For a moment, he paused. His eyes went to his phone, and his hand reached to turn it on, but it didn’t respond.

He noticed it wasn’t plugged in. Silly of me, he thought, and let it be.

He went back to writing. After all, his story was almost finished.",2,1768106762.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

He didn't need to watch me like that. Like a hawk. I wasn’t going to run away. I knew what I needed to do. I just wanted to get this whole thing over and done with as quickly as possible. But there was a clock I had to respect. I had to wait until noon. If I left a minute before twelve o’clock, I risked my release. I wasn’t about to do that. I needed to get free, no matter what it took. 

My handler told me I had to go mingle, “chat with people”. 

“*Really?!*” I asked. I wanted to shout at him but I kept my tone as controlled as I could.

“Really,” he confirmed sternly. “Go.”

I loathed him with ever fibre of my being, but I wasn’t going to show him that. I knew it wasn’t just him watching my every move. I couldn’t see any cameras, but I knew they were watching. I had been instructed to follow this man’s orders, so I would.

I walked into the party hall. It was decorated with colourful birthday balloons and streamers. A big banner saying “Happy Birthday 90th Birthday Nolan!” hung over the crowd. The place was packed with people. I felt immediately claustrophobic amongst the happy throng. 

I squeezed my way through the partiers towards the side of the hall. 

The wall was plastered with photos of what I assumed was Nolan growing up. Him as a cheeky faced baby, a gap-toothed toddler, playing on the swings with his sister, him as a Lion a school play (the Wizard of Oz), holidays and birthdays spanning the years, travelling with his family to Australia, South America, Paris, graduating high school, graduating college, proposing to a young woman…

I looked away from the photos. I didn’t want to see any more. I think I knew he was married. Someone must’ve had told me that but I guess I had shoved that information out of my mind until now.

“We were so young, weren’t we?” An old woman grasped my elbow, looking up at me with a smile. She had been watching me look at the photos. Nolan’s wife, I guessed. I really didn’t want to talk to her, but my eyes flicked to my handler and his sharp gaze told me I should. 

“Yeah, it’s a really great photo,” I said. 

“We haven’t met, I don’t think? I’m Maria,” she said, offering her hand. 

I gave it a quick shake. 

“Eli,” I said. The fake name I used for coffee orders and trivial online subscriptions had popped out of me before I could really think about it. I looked back to my handler. Did it matter if I used that name here? I couldn’t read his expression.

“Eli, nice to meet you,” Maria said warmly. ""So how do you know Nolan?”

“Umm… we met a while back,” I told her. I didn’t want to confess I didn’t know him at all. It felt rude to say at his party. 

“Make sure you get some cake, honey,” she told me. “We ordered Nolan’s favourite, lemon with lemon curd filling. I hope you like lemon!” 

I nodded. “It’s my favourite too,” I said. That wasn’t a lie.

I used the excuse Maria gave me to part ways and head to the cake table. I took a plate and piece of cake and started eating. I kept my eyes on the cake. I wanted to avoid seeing Nolan in person for as long as I could manage it. 

A young boy joined me at the cake table.

“I’ve already had a piece but don’t tell my mum, ok?” He whispered at me. “I’m having another because it’s so good and Grandpa says I can have as much as I want because it’s his birthday and his rules!” 

I nodded in agreement. He grinned at me before scampering off with his new, very large, piece of cake. His boldness reminded me of me at that age. It made me smile. 

I watched as he ran to show off his cake to his Grandpa. 

Nolan. 

There he was. 

He was older here than he had gotten in our timeline. There, his life ended at twenty eight years old, that’s what they told me. This timeline wasn’t supposed to exist. This old man I was looking at wasn't supposed to exist and it was my responsibility to eliminate him.

It had felt straight forward enough when they explained my duty to me earlier. But now, actually seeing the old man in person, I felt my limbs go tingly and my head start to swim. I knew I had to do it though, so I shook my head and peeled my eyes away from Nolan, instead looking to the large clock on the wall. 

I had to wait until after the clock had struck noon to kill him. I didn’t know why, but those were my orders, and I had to obey them. They told me that completing this task of theirs could set me free. I felt the weight of the handgun in my jacket pocket. Somehow, it felt heavier than it had when I had first placed it there.

“Don’t let yourself care,” I told myself silently. “You don’t know him. Besides, he’s already dead. Don’t let yourself care.” 

That’s when the speeches started. Maria made a loving toast to her husband of fifty-two years. Nolan’s children, two daughters and a son, spoke of their wonderful childhoods. They talked about how much they loved their their Dad and how hard he had worked all their lives and how he supported them endlessly… Nolan made a speech too. About how proud he was of his family. Looking back on eighty years, he said though there were tough times, he wouldn’t’ve changed a thing. He really couldn’t have wished for a better life. 

I didn’t want to hear all this. I had tried to focus on counting balloons instead of listening, but the words found me anyway. 

I don’t know what I would’ve rather heard… That his life was terrible and it should’ve ended long ago? But no, he seemed genuinely happy. And that made me feel sick. I felt my hands start to tremble as I gathered courage for what I was there to do. I looked to the clock. It was almost noon. I let my hand grasp the handgun in my pocket. 

“He’s already dead,” I reminded myself. “Don’t let yourself care. You can be free.”

But I felt myself freeze. I couldn’t pull out the gun. 

Then I felt a firm hand grasp my shoulder. 

“Come with me,” my handler told me. 

“Why?!” I asked, confused, as he escorted me away from Nolan. 

I was furious. All I needed was to wait until the second hand clock ticked past twelve and - *Bang!* \- I’d be done! I watched as the second hand ticked closer and closer to the top of the clock as I was ushered through the crowd by my handler. 

He pulled me out of the hall and into the front lobby. It was empty except for us. Silent.

“We told you it was your responsibility to eliminate Nolan Winters from this timeline,” he said.

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “But I had to wait until past noon. Until now! Why’d you drag me out here? Can't I just get on with it?!”

“You looked like you were having trouble,” he said. I could tell he was trying to read me for weakness. “We know it’s a lot to face… taking a life.” 

I steeled my face. “He’s already dead.” I said flatly. “It’s no big deal.” 

“You’ll do it, then?” He asked. 

I pulled the gun from my pocket. It felt so so heavy. Like it was going to drop from my hand. I kept a tight clutch on it, my knuckles white.  

“Ok,” my handler said, still obviously trying to read me. “I’ll let you go back in. But there’s something else we are going to ask of you,” he continued. “We weren’t fully transparent about your task earlier… Now, I will remind you that how you proceed is your choice. You always have a choice.”

“Do I?” I asked. “If I really had a choice, I’d walk out those doors and go home right now. But you’re not going to let me do that, are you?”

“You’re right, I won’t. You’re not ready,” he said.

“Ok, so what else is it you need me to do?” I asked. “Just let me know, and I’ll do it. I just want to go home!”

My handler just stared at me, expressionless for a moment. Then he pushed a folder into my hands. 

“It’s not just Nolan you are responsible for eliminating,” he told me. 

“What?!” I said.

“Open it,” he insisted. 

I did. Inside were photos and names of hundreds of people. They were faces I recognized from the party. Young and old. Nolan’s little grandson was among them. And his wife.

“You must eliminate them all,” my handler told me. 

I felt my heart drop into my stomach. 

“What?” I said, now barely managing to expel a whisper.

“If Nolan had died young, as he did in our timeline, these people wouldn’t exist,” he said. “There is an expansive tree that would’ve grown from his continued life. It is your responsibility to cut down every branch of that tree now. You must eliminate everyone in that hall.”

I couldn’t speak. My eyes were glued to the file. 

“Do you understand?” My handler continued: “With Nolan dead, Maria, would not have survived her severest episode of depression. She wouldn’t’ve lived to be there to save their neighbour when he slipped in the pool. He never would never have gone on to have his own children. Nolan and Maria’s children wouldn’t exist. They never would’ve grown up to be the surgeons and mental health workers they became. The lives they saved over-

“Stop,” I blurted out, “please.” I realized I was shaking uncontrollably. I couldn’t help it. Nothing I could do would make it stop. My face was wet. Tears were streaming down my face. 

“I can’t,” I told him. “I can’t just kill all these people.”

“But you already did,” he said. “In our timeline. When you killed Nolan.” 

“I didn’t mean to kill him, though!” I yelled. “It was an accident! A stupid accident. I drove when I shouldn’t’ve. That’s it! I’m not a murderer. I shouldn’t be here! I shouldn’t have to do this! I just want to go home! This game you’re playing, it’s sick!”

I felt my handler remove the handgun from my hand. Then replace it with a semi-automatic rifle. 

“This is not a game.” he told me. “You are responsible for these lives. Now, are you going to do it? Are you going to accept your responsibility?!”

I felt the rifle drop from my hands, heard it clatter to the floor. 

“No, I don’t want to do this,” I wept. “Just let me go!” 

“You must complete your trial,” my handler said.

I kicked the rifle away from me. 

“If you don’t eliminate them,” my handler said, “we will.”

Suddenly, what looked like a heavily armed SWAT team burst into the lobby from outside. They moved swiftly past me, through the lobby, and towards the party hall. 

“Wait,” I shouted, “no!”

I ran after them, desperately trying to pull them back. But they shook me off effortlessly. 

“No, please,” I begged, I sobbed, “Don’t hurt them!” 

But they didn’t listen to me. *BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-*

I watched in horror as partiers dropped to the floor, dead, blood pooling around them. People screamed and ran, only to be shot down, their blood spraying across the room. Across me. 

I saw Nolan and Maria, clutching each other close, then- BANG-BANG- they fell too. 

Nolan’s little grandson wailed. I tried to get in front of him, but- BANG- he fell too. 

It was all over so quickly. The shooters, having done their job, marched out of the hall. I was left alone, drenched in the blood of the dead. All I could do was sob. 

I was still sobbing  when the glasses were unlocked from my face. The hall disappeared and I was in prison again. I was no longer covered in blood, just drenched in my own sweat. 

The trial was over, I was informed. I knew I had failed, I knew I wasn’t going home anytime soon now, but I didn’t care. All I could do is sob. Sob for Nolan, his family, all of those people… They didn’t deserve that. I felt waves upon waves of grief for them. And fury too. Fury that I had just let it all happen. Somehow, somehow, I should’ve been able to stop it. *Why couldn’t I have stopped it!?*

My mind went to when Nolan died. Not when he was ninety, but when he was twenty-eight. I hadn’t even seen who I had hit. I was so drunk. I remember the smashed car. That’s it. And I remember looking away. I didn’t want to see who the paramedics had pulled from the wreckage. It was all a stupid mistake, that's all I could think about. That’s all I could focus on. One stupid mistake that was going to ruin my life. My life. That was all I could think of then. 

I heard someone speaking to me. The prison officer who had removed my glasses. She spoke to me again. I tried my best to listen. To focus on her words.  

“Did you hear me?” she asked. 

I shook my head. 

“I said, you passed,” she told me.

Have you ever noticed how a game you used to launch just to relax after a long day suddenly starts doing the opposite? Instead of fun, it brings frustration, irritation, and that heavy feeling of *something here is seriously unfair*.  
That’s exactly what happened to me with **Conqueror's Blade** — and the deeper I went, the clearer it became that this wasn’t just “one bad moment”.

At first, everything was great. Massive sieges, the sound of shields colliding, units you slowly build and train, the feeling that you’re part of something bigger than just your own character. You invest time. You invest money. You buy a season pass, plan your progress, aim for rewards. And honestly — that feels reasonable, right? You pay, you play, you expect at least basic fairness.

And then you run into the community wall.

If you’ve spent enough time in Conqueror’s Blade, you already know this part — even if people don’t like saying it out loud. The Turkish community is the largest one in the game. Big, loud, organized, and extremely influential. They dominate chats, coordinate en masse, provoke, insult, and sometimes straight-up try to push others out of servers. This isn’t an occasional thing. It’s the background noise of the game.

You learn to live with it. You mute chats. You ignore it. You scroll past the nonsense and keep playing.

But here’s the catch.  
As long as you stay silent, everything’s “fine”.  
The moment you answer back — not even starting it, just responding in the same tone, same intensity — suddenly *you* are the problem.

Guess who gets punished?

Spoiler: not the ones who started it.

I got banned.  
Not for cheating.  
Not for exploiting bugs.  
Not for repeated toxic behavior.

I got banned for responding.

Context didn’t matter. Screenshots didn’t matter. The fact that the harassment came first didn’t matter. A few lines were pulled out, the situation was flattened into a simple “rule violation”, and that was it. The support system worked fast — but only in one direction.

Still, I tried to be reasonable. I contacted support calmly. No rage, no insults. I explained what happened, provided evidence, and asked a very simple question on top of it all:  
Okay, even if you think the ban is justified — why am I losing access to a season I *paid for* and can no longer complete? Why is there no compensation for unused time or content?

The answer was… polished, polite, and empty.  
“Rules were violated.”  
“Decision is final.”  
“No compensation provided.”

End of conversation.

That’s when it really hit me.

Lately, across many online games, players have been talking more and more about moderation bias. That’s a real trend right now. Not balance issues. Not patches. But double standards. Situations where some groups get a free pass while others are punished instantly because it’s easier, faster, and quieter.

And Conqueror’s Blade fits that pattern a bit too well.

The worst part isn’t even the ban itself. Bans happen. It’s the feeling that you’re disposable. That if you’re not part of the dominant group, your voice, your time, and your money matter less. That support isn’t acting as a neutral referee, but more like a system that removes “inconvenient” players with minimal effort.

You sit there later, coffee in hand, staring at the launcher, thinking: why did I even bother? Why grind units for weeks, why buy seasons, why care — if at any moment you can be shut out without real investigation?

I’m not writing this just to vent. I’m genuinely curious.

Have you ever been banned in a situation like this?  
Have you felt that the rules were applied… selectively?  
That some players can cross lines again and again, while others get punished for a single response?

If yes — talk about it. In comments, on forums, wherever. Because silence is exactly what allows this kind of system to keep going. Games don’t survive on graphics or trailers alone. They survive on trust. And once that trust cracks, no new season can really fix it.

So yeah. I’d really like to hear your story ☕

1q9pv38,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1q9pv38/25_f4m_start_this_year_with_me/,25 [F4M] Start this year with me.,"Dating nowadays feels unnecessarily exhausting. It’s a cycle of half-interest, unclear intentions, and people who want companionship without accountability. Too many are comfortable staying in the gray area, hiding behind ""let’s just see where it goes"" while keeping their options open. I’m at a point where I value clarity over convenience and intention over attention.

That said, I still believe genuine connection can exist even online, even in spaces like this. I’m not in a rush to force anything, but I do want to be aligned from the start. I’m okay with a slow-burn kind of connection, taking time to really know each other, as long as we’re on the same page about where things are headed. I want exclusivity when dating, not ambiguity dressed up as “casual.”

Dating is hard now, yes but if we never try with honesty and intention, how would we ever know what we could’ve had? Above all else, I value honesty. Be direct, be real, be transparent. If you can’t be fully honest about who you are or what you want, please don’t come at me halfway.

About Me:

I’m 5’0—small but definitely not quiet.

Inked, red short hair, Fil-Chi. Fair-skinned (pero nagdidilim pag nagseselos)

Currently around 71kg (sorry nag holiday eh)

I’m working while taking up med school overseas, and I’m currently back home for vacation—enjoying slower days, good conversations, and better coffee. I'm willing to be back and compromise for the right person. I’m easy to talk to as long as the conversation has substance. I'm bubbly and will yap so I hope you'll find that interesting.

I’ll be upfront: I do have vices. If that’s a deal breaker for you, it’s totally okay—better to be honest early on. I’m naturally straight-forward, so I appreciate people who can communicate clearly and don’t shy away from honest conversations.

When I’m not busy, you’ll probably find me reading, happily disappearing down a rabbit hole with a book in hand. Music-wise, I’m into emo bands (OPM & international), 80s love songs, and yes, may konting genggeng sa playlist. I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic, especially when I’m in love. I care deeply and intentionally.

I’m very much a kanal-aircon kind of person with dark humor, a soft spot for late-night drives, road trips, and discovering hidden gem coffee shops.

I’m hoping you’re working or career-oriented, grounded in your own life, and you know what you want. Be straight-forward about your intentions as we’re not kids anymore, and I truly value clarity, honesty, and purpose.

1q9pusv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9pusv,60 hours in NYC (v 01-2026),"This is my second post on this subreddit, another 60 hours in NYC after a drive from Montreal.

This days were some of the coldest on NYC history, a few degrees warmer than Montreal, but still pretty cold to try to replicate my previous trips of sunrise to sunset walking outdoors 

**Day 1**

\- We stopped for breakfast in Elizabethtown, a small restaurant called “*Pleasant Valley Cafe*”, great service and good coffee and food.

\- We arrived late to NYC so only had “*Adel’s Famous*”, it never disappoints and the line was around an hour, so not terrible.

\- To end the night, a stop at “*I’m Donut ?*”, I tried the limited edition Moët donut, and I loved it, the texture and flavor were just perfect, if you don’t like alcohol you won’t like it since it has a strong taste of champagne. (Photo1)

**Day 2**

\- After a 13km run in Central Park, I headed out to “*Culture Espresso*”, to try their vanilla dough cookie, it was really good, however my favorite is still the classic chocolate chip, and that one is still my favorite cookie.

\-  Stopped at “*Los Tacos 1*”, next to Madison Square Garden and shared with my wife 2 tacos. Adobada and steak, both were great and their sauces are actually spicy, would definitely go back if I didn’t go so often to Mexico City. (Photo2)

\- Tried the “*Mamas Too!*” Chicken Vodka Sandwich, and even if it was great, I’ll stick to having pizzas from there. (Photo3)

**-** As I was getting hungry, I checked if there could be some place at opening time at 4Charles, of course there wasn’t, I left my name on the waitlist but went instead to “*Sip and Guzzle*”, wow! This was the highlight of my trip, I shared the burger and the volcano tuna roll with my wife and I wish we hadn’t shared, they were both amazing! The drinks were a great experience, my favorite drink is the Negroni and here is didn’t disappoint, it’s worth the wait to sit at the bar, the bartenders are really nice and she recommended me some places around that I’ll try in the future! (Photos5&6)

\- Walked to Chelsea market and after having read good reviews of “*Very Fresh Noodles*”, I tried them and the classic lamb dry noodles didn’t disappoint, also had some dumplings on the side.(Photo7)

\- I wanted to try the overrated, but affordable Din Tai Fung, however there wasn’t a waitlist as well, so walked instead to “*Golden Hof*”, where we shared the chicken sandwich and the sticky noodles, also had the pancakes as dessert. On my last visit I went to Golden Diner and I loved the pancakes, but somehow I think they tasted different here, I didn’t live them, however the sandwich and noodles were really good and the place is nice and 0 wait compared to the OG in Chinatown.

**Day 3**

\- “*Chip City”*, cookies and cream cookie, my 2nd favorite of the day. (Photo 8)

\- “*Bagel Pub*”, first time here and decided to try their limited edition “Super Nova”, I loved it, my favorite bagel overall so far, however, the bagel itself, the bread, I prefer Apollo. (Photo9)

\- Coffee stop and chocolate chip cookie at “*Seven Grams*”, good coffee, but my least favorite cookie of the day. (Photo10)

\- “Mei Lai Wah” bakery for their famous pineapple  bun and tried as well the pork one, I prefer the pork, but both were great, specially for the price and speed. (Photo11)

\- “Pecking House” never disappoints, amazing spicy chicken sandwich with great service and foo quality.(Photo12)

\- Got a lobster tail at “*Ferrara*”, it was a recommendation from a friend and a great one, I didn’t eat it right away since I was full but ate it at the hotel later that night and it didn’t get soggy, it was still crispy and the size was humongous. (Photo 13)

\-Coffee stop at “*Caffe Paradiso*”, where I would have usually had their tap coffee, but it was freezing out, so I had instead their cardamom hot latte and it was a really good one. 

\- Stopped for a coffee at “*L’Appartement 4F*” and tried their chocolate cookie, it was a good cookie, but wouldn’t go out of my way again to get it. 3rd favorite cookie of the day. (Photo4)

\- My favorite cookie of the day was from “*Hani’s*”, a cookie that I would go out of my way to get again, I had a hot chocolate here, but I found it too heavy. (Photo14)

\- A matcha from “*Ralph’s Coffee*” before our Broadway musical

\- I went out to eat with a group after broadway, so we chose “*Carmine’s*”, to be honest, I was expecting very little from this place and it didn’t disappoint, big portions sine we were 6 people, we had a Caesar salad, a veal limone and pasta à la vodka and we even had leftovers, quick and good service and more than decent food. Definitely not the best Italian, but centric and good to seat and talk.

**Day 4**

\- After another 13 km run, I had a coffee at “*Culture Espresso*” (again) and this time the traditional chocolate chip cookie, where I confirmed it’s really my favorite cookie.

\- “*Apollo Bagels*” and had the salmon on everything bagel, to have a fair comparison with Bagel Pub, and even if I liked more the bread, all of the inside was better from Bagel Pub, however I liked the fresh dill.

I feel like the world's biggest idiot... I left food in the oven and completely forgot about it. It was supposed to cook at 450 for 20mins, and that 20mins turned into a 6.5 hour bake.

I woke up to smoke everywhere, surprisingly (and quite frankly, concerning) the smoke detectors didn't go off until after I woke up. Obviously I have to clean the oven before I use it, I wiped down cabinets, floors, counters. I have vinegar, coffee grounds, baking soda all out everywhere. Candles are going as well just to mask it a little. Thankfully there's not much fabric in the areas that were affected, it's been airing out all day as well.

It's like a 1000sq ft single floor home (but its rented...), I don't see residue anywhere other than inside the oven, and above the stovetop (which has been cleaned), and the walls near it. Everything has been wiped. I can still smell it here and there, obviously not as strong as when the place was hazy, but it's still there lingering.

Will I be able to fix this with giving it time and cleaning? Or did I just ruin my house like a pack-a-day smoker?

And it was because it bothered my throat. Like when I'd drink orange juice or lemonade. As a kid I didn't understand that it didn't happen to everyone so I didn't voice it to adults. I just said I didn't like it.  As I got older, specifically when my 30's hit it started to get worse and spread to other things. Certain coffees will cause the same scratchiness in my throat. As well as certain tomato/marinara sauces. Not all, but specifically more acidic ones. And if I keep going I will start to cough and feel a heaviness in my chest. I am suspicious it's a citric acid thing. But I don't know for sure. I went to see an allergist and the only answer I got was ""well just avoid things that bother you"". I paid them $300 and walked away saying, yeah no shit 🙄. After that I asked my primary physician about it and he was able to send off a test to see if I was allergic to citrus and it came back that I wasn't. 

Any ideas on what could be going on? Anyone experience something similar? ",1,1768105429.0,FoodAllergies,2,1.0,False

Here's the collective wisdom on what Miles plagiarized from whom.

* So What -- from Shorty Rogers' ""Dance Espresso"", which itself comes from Tchaikovsky's ""Coffee Dance""from the Nutcracker Suite; also, Ahmad Jamal's record of Gould's ""Pavanne"", particularly Ray Crawford's solo
* Four -- Eddie Cleanhead Vinson
* Tune Up -- Eddie Vinson
* Solar -- Chuck Wayne's ""Sunny""
* Nardis -- John Carisi (weak speculation; no evidence)
* Nefertiti -- Wayne Shorter
* Milestones -- John Lewis
* Little Willie Leaps -- John Lewis
* Serpent's Tooth -- Jimmy Heath
* Blue In Green -- Miles wrote the first two chords, Bill Evans the rest.
* Flamenco Sketches -- Bill Evans claimed partial credit for this one too.
* Donna Lee -- Charlie Parker got the credit; Miles probably wrote it based on licks he took from Fats Navarro's solo on ""Ice Freezes Red""
* Half-Nelson -- written by Miles based on licks he took from Fats Navarro's solo(s) on Ladybird
* Dig -- Jackie McLean's ""Donna""



Miles's autobiography also plagiarizes from Jack Chambers' biography.

The provenance of So What, Donna Lee, and Half-Nelson has been established

through musicological analysis. The provenance of Nardis is often debated, and there is no clear answer. All of the other attributions are made according to

the claims of the composers listed.

According to one account that I read, when Miles first brought Benny Carter's ""When Lights Are Low"" to a recording session, he claimed that he was the composer. However, he couldn't remember the bridge to what was supposedly his own tune, so he created a new one by repeating the ""A"" section, transposed up a fourth.
