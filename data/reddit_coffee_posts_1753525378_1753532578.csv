I‚Äôd swiped through Muzz for weeks, premium subscription and all, only to find robotic replies and checklists disguised as profiles. Beauty or brains, never both. I was one uninspired ‚Äúlol‚Äù away from deleting the app when her like popped up‚Äîa tiny spark in the digital void. Curious, I liked back, figuring I‚Äôd give it one last shot.

Her name was Lila‚Äîat least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll call her. Our first chat lasted an hour, words flowing like we‚Äôd been friends for a decade. No small talk, no family ultimatums, just two people riffing on life. By day two, we were deep into The Dark Knight quotes, debating whether Harvey Dent was a hero or a hot mess. Day three, we swapped Instagram handles, and the floodgates opened. Cinema, religion, politics, parenting, even our mutual love for spicy biryani‚Äîeverything clicked, like we were two puzzle pieces from the same box. Ninety-five percent match, I told myself, grinning at my phone like an idiot. She was sharp, educated, a little out of my league with her fancy degree and family business. I figured my gym-honed biceps and quick wit evened the score.

We moved to WhatsApp, and it was electric. Late-night texts turned into love-bombed novellas. I wrote her a sappy poem about star-crossed vibes; she sent back a Suits reference that had me cackling. Every buzz of my phone felt like a hit of dopamine. I‚Äôd get antsy when she was offline, but her replies were instant, articulate, perfect. ‚ÄúIs this what soulmates do?‚Äù I wondered, half-joking, half-hoping.

The voice call was our first reality check. Her laugh was softer than I‚Äôd imagined, a little hesitant, but we traded embarrassing stories‚Äîmy failed attempt at skateboarding, her spilling coffee on a client. It wasn‚Äôt texting‚Äôs fireworks, but it was warm, real. I was still all in.

Then came the meetup. A cozy caf√©, the kind with mismatched chairs and the smell of fresh croissants. I spotted her by the window, her face familiar from Instagram but somehow‚Ä¶ different. We ordered lattes, played Jenga, and I tried teaching her chess. She knocked over the king, laughing, but the air felt flat, like a soda left open too long. No butterflies, no banter, just two introverts fumbling through silence. I didn‚Äôt feel her energy; she didn‚Äôt feel mine. We fist-bumped awkwardly and parted ways.

Ten minutes later, her text lit up my phone: ‚ÄúNot feeling it, sorry.‚Äù I typed back, ‚ÄúSame,‚Äù and that was it. No heartbreak, no longing‚Äîjust a weird void where the spark should‚Äôve been. Like we‚Äôd built a castle in the cloud, only to find it was smoke. Online, we were perfect. In person, we were strangers.

Was it the app‚Äôs fault, hyping up a connection that couldn‚Äôt survive daylight? Or do some sparks just fizzle when you try to hold them? What‚Äôs the weirdest way online dating let you down?",1,1753532451.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1m9rxu5,https://archiveofourown.org/works/58247008/chapters/148326691,I put off reading Numberland and now I‚Äôm crying in my coffee,"I don‚Äôt know why i put if off, okay?

But it ended up being so much more and so different than what I expected. I finished it 4 hours ago (in the middle of the night and yeah, I cried and fell asleep crying and now I have crusty eyes but it‚Äôs the morning and I‚Äôm taking my coffee while thinking about it, rereading my favorite parts and wow.)

I am unwell. I am fulfilled. I am hurting. I am speechless. Stunned. WHAT THE FUCK.

This is one of the best piece of fanfic that was written in the last year. All you can ask for is there. You wanna cry? You will. You wanna laugh? You will. You wanna blush? You will. You wanna gasp? You will. You wanna fall in love with every character? You will. EVEN THE DOG.

It‚Äôs one of the most unique worlds and storyline I‚Äôve seen. This is not a typical hunger games/squid games fic, there is so much more to it, so much depth and unique elements tying it together; the end of the world vibe, the fog, the civil war, the dog, the mystery part of it (iykyk). We have plot twists, we have magic, we have combat, we have foreshadowing and full circle moments, we have intricate feelings of numbness, loyalty, humanity, grief and love. The imagination that went behind writing this is wild.

It is, truly, a hidden gem. Don‚Äôt avoid it like I did! 

If you need to know some information before going in (HEA, the dog, etc.), read the notes before chapter 1, the author is very transparent about everything you could be worried about.

Yesterday I had a small coffee at 3pm and didn't fall asleep before 5 am. I was on vacation with my dad all week and he makes good coffee, so i usually drink coffee for breakfast when i'm with him.

1m9rwoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m9rwoh/what_is_the_coolest_neighborhood_in_pittsburgh/,What is the coolest neighborhood in Pittsburgh?,"I recently moved to Pittsburgh and spent months exploring every corner of this incredible city. After checking out all the neighborhoods, I have to say - the South Side is hands down the coolest area in Pittsburgh.

What makes South Side special is its perfect blend of history and modern culture. The main drag, East Carson Street, stretches for about 15 blocks and is packed with everything from craft breweries to vintage shops. The architecture here tells stories - many buildings still have their original Victorian-era facades from when this was a bustling industrial hub.

I discovered an awesome way to get oriented with the South Side (and Pittsburgh in general) through this double-decker bus tour I took [https://athometouch.com/pittsburgh]. It gave me a great overview of not just South Side but all of Pittsburgh's key neighborhoods. The guide shared fascinating bits about the area's steel mill history and how it transformed into today's entertainment district.

The South Side's character really comes alive at night. The street fills with people hopping between unique bars and restaurants. During the day, you'll find locals browsing through independent bookstores, grabbing coffee at quirky cafes, or climbing the famous South Side Steps for incredible city views.

One of my favorite spots is the South Side Works, an outdoor shopping and entertainment complex built on old mill grounds. It perfectly represents how this neighborhood preserves its industrial heritage while embracing modern development.

Speaking of history, don't miss the South Side Slopes area. These steep hillsides are lined with historic homes built for mill workers, connected by Pittsburgh's famous city steps. It's like an outdoor museum of the city's working-class roots.

The food scene here is incredible too. You'll find everything from traditional Polish pierogies to modern fusion restaurants. The Strip District might be Pittsburgh's official food neighborhood, but South Side gives it serious competition.

If you're planning to explore South Side (or Pittsburgh in general), I highly recommend starting with that bus tour I mentioned. It helped me understand the neighborhood's context within Pittsburgh's larger story, and the upper deck offers amazing views of the city's architecture. You can book it here: [https://athometouch.com/pittsburgh]

Trust me, once you spend some time in South Side, you'll understand why it's considered Pittsburgh's coolest neighborhood. It's got that perfect mix of history, culture, and modern energy that makes a neighborhood truly special.

I've lived in several cities, but there's something unique about how South Side balances preservation with progress. Whether you're a history buff, foodie, or just looking for a good time, this neighborhood has something for everyone.

Remember though, the best way to appreciate South Side is to first understand its place in Pittsburgh's story, which is why that comprehensive tour was so valuable for me when I first arrived.",1,1753532295.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m9rwel,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m9rwel/i_was_never_going_to_fit_in/,I Was Never Going to Fit In,"It's been hard for me thinking that I didn't leave sooner when I realize some things that would always create dissonance between me and the Mormon church. Not only it's teachings but it's culture. 

""Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law."" (1 Corinthians 14:34). I was never going to be quiet, I'm a very outspoken person especially when it comes to defending what I think is right. 

‚ÄúWomen of God can never be like women of the world. The world has enough women who are tough; we need women who are tender. There are enough women who are coarse; we need women who are kind. There are enough women who are rude; we need women who are refined. We have enough women of fame and fortune; we need more women of faith. We have enough greed; we need more goodness. We have enough vanity; we need more virtue. We have enough popularity; we need more purity.‚Äù (Margaret D. Nadauld, ‚ÄúThe Joy of Womanhood,‚Äù Ensign, Nov. 2000, 15). I'd like to note that the meaning of this is not how my mother interpreted it. But she had no problem with thinking that I needed to be weak and soft and pliable. No thanks for the fact that 90% of the yardwork and heavy lifting was done by me. It was a argument that would always be contradictory to her. Be soft, unless I need you to move things. 

""For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."" (1 Corinthians 11:8-9). I was not made for a man, I will not be treated as such. I am not subservient. When I had first left the church and had moved out of Utah, there was a guy talking to one of my friends, friends. He told her ""women are at the mercy of men"". I had not been there when he said it, because if I had heard it I would've kicked his ass, and then would've pinned him while saying ""who's at the mercy of who right now?"". The girl he said this to was missing both her hands to a birth defect. 

I couldn't find anything on this, polygamy... If I got married no one could convince me nor force me to be one of many wives. And if I found out my husband tried to keep another wife from me, I'd bury him. God, the Prophet, anyone really could not command me to do this. My fury would not go unnoticed and if need be I'd wage war against the very Almighty God himself (if you think that's crazy, I would not stop until I win... There is no outer darkness that I would not come back from... There is no getting rid of me, I'd be like a cockroach, and I'd be relentless). 

Growing up in Utah was weird, I didn't notice this until I was older because there were no other ethnic people to talk to. But I realized that there was only certain people that would go on a date with me, and I only went on like three dates in high school because I wasn't attracted to these people (they were like brothers to me it was weird). But as I've gotten older I've noticed that these people had closeted porn addictions and fetishes, or were trying to rebell against their families (good for them ig). People didn't want to date a brown girl in Utah. And on top of this, I can't believe I didn't notice this. It only became clear to me after I got out of my very abusive household. My adopted female caregiver (the Kracken) was extremely racist (I was adopted by a white family), she didn't even know my race. But she would always be like you got to find a nice Polynesian husband. Or any guy that was brown. It was just so weird to me, and she tried to pressure me into a culture that wasn't mine. I did know growing up knowing though that I was part Puerto Rican. And one day I did my makeup a certain way and she asked, ""are you trying to look latina"". And I was like bitch I'm Puerto Rican, I don't have to try to look it. She also bullied my sister's ex boyfriend telling him that she was going to get him and his father deported even though they were US citizens. Also in the MTC I had people that would wrongly guess my ethnicity, and I'd constantly be correcting people.

""Honor thy father and thy mother"". I respect those who respect me. And I'm not going to be lead by people that act like children and never grew up. 

My adopted shitheads, also when I was 13 and my best friend tried to end her life told me that she was stupid. I've never disagreed with them before this, and I'd never been so angry with them. 

I hate the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, I absolutely hate them, and church music... And EFY songs, and David Archuleta. This music is like nails on a chalk board to me, or someone playing with styrofoam. Needles in my ears. I'd much rather listen to Papa Roach, Eminem, Elvy the God, Kid Cudi... Just please no Mormon music üò≠. I also hated Youth Choir, like dear God my voice was not meant to be so insulted (my voice was made for screamo, blues, jazz, or rap). I did find out my biological Dad is half African American. 

My Grandpa was a convert from Catholicism. He and my grandma we're married at 16(M) and 17(F). He didn't convert until later, and he did it for her. But he always drank coffee until the very end. I loved the smell. And on my mission a Sister that I lived with let me try Pero (a coffee substitute), it was so fucking good. I don't drink coffee much now, but I love iced coffee every now and again. I also on my mission tried energy drinks for the first time, whenever I was being bullied by people in the mission I'd buy Chinese food or Sushi and I would get an energy drink (I tried every drink I could get my hands on). 

I had one memory of my biological mom groing up and it's weird because just by smell I can tell exactly what type of cigarettes she smoked. Marlboro, reds, 100s. She doesn't smoke anymore. But anytime the Kracken would stick her nose up to someone smoking, I'd be enjoying the aroma. 

I've always wanted tattoos and piercings. And I have some pretty cool ideas... Too many to share üòÖ. One tattoo I want to get is a Jack of Hearts on my wrist. My grandpa died of cancer when I was 18. They called him jack even though his name was John. And it's in hearts, because he'll always have my heart. There was this one time that my mother was criticizing someone outside a grocery store, she was like ""I feel sorry for her, just look at those tattoos""... Before she said this I had already been admiring her tattoos, like she was so beautiful ü•π.

Say something in the comments and I‚Äôll share.,"I gave up my twenty-billion-dollar inheritance and cut ties with my family, all for my boyfriend of five years, Ignatz.

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.

He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.

When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.

""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""

He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.

He knew. And he still sent me.

I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.

My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.

""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""

Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""

The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.

Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.

""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""

I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.

""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""

""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""

My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""

""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""

I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""

""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""

He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.

""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.

He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""

""I'm pr\*\*nant.""

The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.

Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.

""No,"" he said.

""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""

He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""

I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""

""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""

""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""

He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""

My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""

The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.

""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""

""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""

I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""

Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.

Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.

""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""

His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.

He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.

""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""

Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.

The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.

She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.

""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""

The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.

He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.

I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.

I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.

And then I felt it.

A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.

Don't let me go.

""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.

The nurse turned, surprised.

""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""

I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.

Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.

The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""

The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.

Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.

""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""

""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""

""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""

I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.

I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.

""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""

I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.

""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""

Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.

The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.

There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.

It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.

Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""

Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.

""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""

I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""

He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""

He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.

""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""

I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.

I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.

I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.

Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.

""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.

He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.

""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""

I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.

Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""

Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""

""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""

Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""

For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.

The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.

Then I walked into the kitchen.

Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.

They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.

Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""

""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""

""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.

The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.

""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""

I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.

""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""

My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.

Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""

Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.

""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.

I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.

He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""

""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.

""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""

He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.

My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.

This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.

Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.

I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.

Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.

Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.

I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.

""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""

I had thought he meant me.

Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.

When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.

""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.

""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""

The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.

I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.

Whispers erupted around me.

""Is that her? The stalker?""

""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""

I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.

Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.

I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.

""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.

Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""

She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""

Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.

Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.

I stood there, silent.

Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""

""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""

I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.

He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""

""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""

""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""

""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.

Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.

Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""

I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.

I went down, hard.

My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.

I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.

""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""

He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.

Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.

I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.

With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.

I didn't even look for it.

Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.

I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.

""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.

I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.

""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""

Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.

Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.

My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.

""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""

The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.

Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.

Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.

""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.

Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.

""What are you doing? She's my patient!""

""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.

They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.

""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.

I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.

Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""

I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""

""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""

""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""

There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""

The line went dead.

Hope died with it.

They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.

Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.

No. No, no, no.

Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.

""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""

I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""

""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""

The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.

I was alone.

I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.

When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""

The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.

As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.

I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.

A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.

A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.

I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.

I pressed the call button.

It rang twice.

""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""

""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""

""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""",2,1753532019.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1m9rtia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9rtia,Should I dye this sweater?,"I have been struggling a lot with this sweater, which is the fourth thing I have ever knit. Getting the bottom ribbing to look correct took a lot of trial and error, as well as getting the correct stitch count to make a women's S/XS (I started out with way too many stitches and had to tear it out and re-do) but I am finally happy with it knitting-wise. However, now I am not so sure about the colors. My original plan was to alternate burnt orange 100% wool with leftover 100% wool Noro Ito yarn from several previous projects to use up scraps, but I'm not sure that I am liking the way the orange and other colors interact. I was hoping the orange-brown would make the overall effect more unified and muted, and that the sweater would have an autumnal vibe, but to me the stripes are just looking rather garish and not like fall tones at all. If anything, the yellows and pale greens and pale greys pop even more against the orange- in my opinion in a bad way. Now I am thinking of dying the finished sweater with a brown dye of some sort (RIT? coffee?) to make the entire thing a little bit darker, more muted and more unified color-wise. Thoughts? Is this a terrible idea? Anybody else try something similar? I have just struggled with this sweater too much to want to end up with a finished product that I don't even like enough to wear!!

# ¬†

# Jim shook himself mentally and wished for the millionth time that his beloved wife Belinda was still alive, he needed her wisdom and warmth more than ever now.

# ¬†

# He called his chief of staff and had him call an emergency meeting at four am. Then he quickly got dressed and phoned his in laws to inform them of their granddaughters' disappearance.¬†

# ¬†

# Then he phoned his own parents and told them the same, he promised both sets of grandparents that he would keep them informed of any developments as they happened.

# ¬†

# Jim Hoover took the lift down to the Situation Room and took his seat, the secret service team had already briefed to kitchen about the early emergency meeting, so, they had produced plenty of coffee and toast ETC.

# ¬†

# When the rest of the cabinet staff arrived, Jim Hoover was sat at the head of the table, a half-finished coffee in front of him and a picture of his late wife and his daughter in his hand.

# ¬†

# The last member took his place and then silence fell over the room, all that could be heard was the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner.

# ¬†

# After what seemed an age, Jim cleared his throat and spoke, he said, ‚Äúladies and gentlemen, I apologise for calling you here at such an ungodly hour, but a situation has arisen.

# ¬†

# Yesterday afternoon a plane took off from Washington Dulles airport bound for London Heathrow airport. It arrived this morning at 06:50 GMT.¬†

# ¬†

# It was carrying 539 passengers and crew, but when it landed, the plane was completely empty, everybody on board had vanished,

# ¬†

# It was a direct flight, there were no stop offs en route, so, it is impossible for everyone to disappear like this.‚Äù

# ¬†

# There was a babble of voices around the table, Jim Hoover stood silently watching them, when the noise died down, Jim continued, ‚Äúone of the passengers was my daughter, Emily, she was travelling incognito.¬†

# ¬†

# So, ladies and gentlemen, do you have any ideas about how they could have disappeared.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# Meanwhile back in the UK, Catherine had called her own meeting of COBRA, after explaining what happened that morning at Heathrow Airport, she opened the floor for any suggestions.

# ¬†

# A rather nondescript man wearing a black leather jacket and blue jeans said, ‚Äúthe first thing to do is to put a very tight ring of security around the hanger that the plane is currently inside, if you want, I can get some of my boys down here within the hour.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Catherine nodded and said, ‚Äúthank you Captain Hinde, that would be most helpful.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Captain Hinde took a phone from his pocket, dialed a number, and spoke quietly into the phone, thirty seconds later, he hung up, nodded at Catherine, and said, ‚ÄúDone, a Chinook is picking them up in ten minutes, so they‚Äôll be here in about 45 minutes.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Other suggestions were mentioned, two of them were, check the black box, flight recorder to see if that picked up anything about what happened on the flight.¬†

# ¬†

# The other suggestion was to check the overhead satellites to check the plane‚Äôs flight path to see if that could give any clues.

# ¬†

# After the meeting was concluded, the air crash investigators at Fareham UK were contacted and were asked to send an investigator to Heathrow to remove the black box and analyse the contents of it, but to keep it a closely guarded secret for now.

# ¬†

# In America, they had decided to investigate the personal details of the pilot and crew of flight 0745, while others were checking every inch of its flightpath, by satellite.

# ¬†

# The air crash investigator from Fareham arrived at Heathrow and was escorted to the hanger by two heavily armed police officers,¬†

# ¬†

# which was the second indication that something was wrong, the first was when the investigatory team couldn‚Äôt find any news of a crash at Heathrow.

# ¬†

# To get into the hanger they had to pass through a ring of men dressed in black overalls, wearing full facemasks, and carrying machineguns.

# ¬†

# Once the investigator entered the hanger, he asked one of the police men, ‚Äúwho were those men outside.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# The police man gave a grim smile and said, ‚Äúthey are the hooligans from Hereford.‚Äù

# ¬†

# The investigator, David Parry, said, ‚Äúwho.‚Äù

# ¬†

# The police man said, ‚ÄúSAS‚Äù

# ¬†

# David Parry gulped and turned to look at the plane, it was an American Airline Boeing 747. He climbed to stairs and under the watchful eye of the police officer, he removed the black box, flight recorder.

# ¬†

# This done, he got the Police officer, Barry Roberts, to sign the papers, stated that he had watched David Parry remove the black box from flight 0745.

# ¬†

# David Parry then returned to Fareham to check the black box, he connected it up to the mainframe computer and started downloading the information, once he had taken a backup of the information.

# ¬†

# He called his boss into the room to listen to the play back, the first couple of hours of the flight were silent, then they heard the various control towers picking them up as they flew into their airspace.¬†

# ¬†

# Then there was some radio chatter, but nothing between the pilot and co-pilot, there was no interruptions by the cabin crew bringing them food or drinks.

# ¬†

# There was nothing on the black box from when they left Dulles Airport, nothing from the control tower, or any others that should have spoken to them until they passed them out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

# ¬†

# This news was passed back to the team at Heathrow, they found this strange as well, so, they started checking the plane more thoroughly.

# ¬†

# The head of the flight maintenance team, Joe Rice, called his opposite number at Dulles Airport asking for the records for the last time the plane was serviced.

# ¬†

# After they received clearance from their bosses, they faxed the information over to Joe Rice and his Team, who immediately started checking everything on the plane.¬†

# ¬†

# One of the first things they checked were the engines, listing down the serial numbers, and general condition, etc.¬†

# ¬†

# These serial numbers were compared with the numbers listed in the maintenance log that had been received from Dulles, they didn‚Äôt match.¬†

# ¬†

# So, Joe left his office and checked the numbers himself, they didn‚Äôt match, he even took a photo so he could double check when he got back to his office.

# ¬†

# Back in his office, Joe downloaded the pictures onto his computer and checked them, the numbers definitely did not match,¬†

# ¬†

# then he noticed something that he hadn‚Äôt seen while looking at the engines, they were covered in a light coating of sand.¬†

# ¬†

# Joe thought this was strange, because America Airlines didn‚Äôt usually fly into any Arabic countries, so, he phoned back to Dulles Airport.

# ¬†

# He said to his contact, ‚Äúhave you sent me the details of the right plane.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# His contact, Earl Martell, said, ‚Äúyes, why.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# Joe said, ‚ÄúWell the engine serial numbers don‚Äôt match up. Plus, do you guys fly to sandy countries by any chance.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# Earl paused for a moment and then said, ‚Äúyes, they are the details of the right plane, and no, you are correct, American Airlines don‚Äôt fly to any sandy countries, why?‚Äù

# ¬†

# Joe quickly emailed Earl the pictures he had just taken of the engines of the 747 that had landed at Heathrow that morning.

# ¬†

# Earl swore and said to Joe, ‚ÄúHey buddy, can you sit on this for a while, like ten minutes.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# Joe said, ‚Äúnot really, my guys are climbing over the plane at the moment, and they are going to spot something very soon.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Earl said, ‚Äúok, tell your bosses now, I‚Äôll do the same here. Good luck, the shit is about to hit the fan.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Just as Earl predicted, the shit really hit the fan, both here in the UK and in the USA.

# ¬†

# At Heathrow, the maintenance crews climbed all over the 747 with a fine-toothed comb, checking everywhere.¬†

# ¬†

# After about an hour of searching, an urgent call came over the radio, ‚Äúa body had been found in the electronics chamber, which was located by the front baggage hold.

# ¬†

# Access to the chamber was made by lifting a metal hatch in the passenger deck and descending a steep metal ladder into the front baggage hold, then through that via a panel into the electronics chamber.

# ¬†

# The body was examined in situ, before being removed to the moved to the mortuary at Hounslow for post-mortem.

# ¬†

# This was carried out by Dr Shirley Hooper, she started the post-mortem at 10:30 am, she started off by stating her name and the names of her two assistants, Karen Nolan, and Derek Lancaster.

# ¬†

# They started by weighing and measuring the body, the Dr Hooper spoke into the overhead microphone, ‚Äúthe body is that of a well-nourished white male, approximately thirty years of age,¬†

# ¬†

# There are no visible signs of injuries present on the body, there are a few old scars, these will be photographed and noted, some of these scars look medical in origin,

# ¬†

# Samples have been taken for testing; the brain has been removed for scanning for any signs of cancer or tumours.

# ¬†

# The stomach contents show that the last meal that was eaten was chicken and rice, note to self, check with America as to what the pilot ate before the flight.¬†

# ¬†

# Derek Lancaster made a note to remind himself to check with the Americans, finally the post-mortem was completed, the incisions were sewn up, and the body was placed into a refrigerated drawer to await whatever fate awaited it.

# ¬†

# In America, the flight crews' personal histories were checked into, right back until they left high school, the pilot, Captain James Boyle the third, was a former pilot in the USAF.¬†

# ¬†

# He had served for ten years and left with the rank of Major, he had been with American Airlines for twelve years and had an impeccable flying record.¬†

# ¬†

# The co-pilot was Julie Craker, she had served in the USAF under James Boyle, she was a thirty-seven-year-old black woman,

# ¬†

# She had been with American Airlines for eight years, again with an impeccable record.

# ¬†

# All the cabin crew had been with American Airlines for at least five years, none of them had as much as a mark on their records for being rude to a passenger.

# ¬†

# So, the FBI searched everything about the crew, their search revealed that one of the cabin crew was a lesbian, one of the others had downloaded child porn onto her computer, another one was having an affair.

# ¬†

# But when they checked in to Captain James Boyle the third, they discovered that he was hiding a big secret, a massive secret, he was a closet Muslim.

# ¬†

# For all the years that he had been in the USAA, and had been flying for American Airlines, he had been hiding this major secret from everybody.¬†

# ¬†

# This news shook the FBI team to the core; a committed Muslim was flying the President‚Äôs daughter across the globe.

# ¬†

# The news of this was sent straight to the White house and the message was passed directly to Joe Hoover, he held his head in despair.

# ¬†

# The news sped across the Atlantic to Downing Street and the P.M called an emergency meeting of COBRA to keep them up to date on the latest developments.

# ¬†

# The DNA testing had brought in a familial match, it was for a family living in Scarbough, the family was immediately put under surveillance.

# ¬†

# Their data was accessed straight away, the father was called Brian Sale, he worked at the local garage as a mechanic, the mother was called Jane Sale, she worked as a secretary at the nearby hospital,¬†

# ¬†

# they had three sons, one was called Colin, he was sixteen-year-old and still in at school, the middle son was called Michael, he was eighteen and studying electro engineering at university,¬†

# ¬†

# the eldest was Ben, he was twenty-four, he had studied world religions at Oxford university, but had dropped out, converted to Islam, changed his name, travelled to Pakistan, and lived there for about three years, his parents had no idea of his current whereabouts.¬†

# ¬†

# When Catherine Wright disclosed this piece of news, Captain Hinde said, ‚ÄúClever, using a cleanskin.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Catherine said, ‚ÄúI beg your pardon.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# David Hinde said, ‚Äúa cleanskin, a Caucasian person, who hasn‚Äôt been in trouble with the police, they can get into places that somebody of Asian heritage wouldn‚Äôt be able to, or at least not without a lot of attention being drawn to them.

# ¬†

# I bet when this guy landed the plane, the air traffic controller who spoke to him didn‚Äôt notice that he didn‚Äôt have an American accent, but he certainly would have noticed an Asian accent.‚Äù

# ¬†

# The dental records confirmed the identity of the pilot of the 747 at Heathrow was Ben Sale.

# ¬†

# The next thing to do was the find out how the two planes had been switched mid-flight, so, every inch of the flight was scrutinised, both by the American‚Äôs and the British.

# ¬†

# Both teams came to the same conclusion, the switch must have taken place mid-Atlantic, the last control tower that picked them up on US soil was in Nova Scotia.

# ¬†

# The next control tower to speak to them would be in Ireland, so for several hours they would be out of radio contact with anyone.

# ¬†

# So, the search was narrowed into the vast area of empty ocean, as one agent was heard to say, ‚Äúthis is like looking for a needle in a whole field of haystacks.‚Äù

# ¬†

# The families of the passengers who had been on board flight 0745 were told that there had been a chemical leak on board, necessitating the immediate quarantine of all the passengers and crew.¬†

# ¬†

# The quarantine would be of an indeterminate period, the families would be kept informed of proceedings.¬†

# ¬†

# The search for the missing plane continued, meanwhile, the toxicology report on Ben Sales body found the presence of cyanide,¬†

# ¬†

# So, it looked like he landed the plane at Heathrow, spoke to the control tower, taxied to the right place, parked, then climbed down into the electronic cabinet, took cyanide after cramming himself into a tight place to hide his body his body for as long as possible.

# ¬†

# So, they now knew who had flown the plane into Heathrow, now they just had to find the missing plane with the 539 people on board.

# ¬†

# Experts both in the UK and in America, searched the route taken by flight 0745 for days, then finally, they spotted the flight suddenly descend from 38,000 feet and disappear from the radar and just as suddenly climb back to its original flying altitude.

# ¬†

# It happened so quickly and smoothly, that if you weren‚Äôt looking for it, it would have gone un-noticed.

# ¬†

# The switchover had taken place close to the coast of North Africa, so now the American satellite pictures were very carefully scanned.

# ¬†

# In the middle of the Western Sahara, is a small settlement called Bir Anzerane, it is a small trading post, but there is a large main road that runs past it.

# ¬†

# The satellite pictures showed, parked on the hard packed sand beside the road, was a Boeing 747, bearing the livery of American Airlines.

# ¬†

# They checked with American Airlines, no planes had been sold anywhere in the Western Sahara, plus there weren‚Äôt any airports in that area.

# ¬†

# The plane had been found, now they had to find the passengers and crew.¬†

# ¬†

# The surveillance teams now widened their search by five miles in each direction, but found nothing, so they expanded their search to twenty miles.

# ¬†

# They found a large, tented enclosure not far from an oasis, a satellite was positioned above the camp so that they had a real-time picture of events.¬†

# ¬†

# The footage revealed that there were approximately fifty armed guards, holding the missing passengers, the satellite focused in so closely that they could make out individual faces.¬†

# ¬†

# Stills were saved from the live feed, and these were checked against the passport photos taken at Dulles Airport before the flight took off.

# ¬†

# Within twenty minutes, a message was sent to Joe Hoover at the White House, one of his aides interrupted a meeting he was in to pass him the sealed envelope.

# ¬†

# President Hoover took the envelope with shaking hands, tore it open and read the contents, he let out the breath that he didn‚Äôt know that he was holding.

# ¬†

# And for the first time in about twenty hours, felt that there was a tiny glimmer of hope, he told the rest of the chiefs of staff at the meeting the good news.

# ¬†

# Admiral Paul Mayfield, spoke, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the SEALs ready for action as soon as possible, Joe.‚Äù¬†

# ¬†

# There were no ranks used in staff meetings.¬†

# ¬†

# Joe Hoover said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good idea, we had better link up with the intel boys to get some up-to-date data on what we‚Äôll be facing.‚Äù

# ¬†

# General Carl Cooper of the USAA, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get transport organised, I assume that any possible raid will have to take off from the UK, so, if the seals are ready, we can send them and the kit they need across the pond tonight so, they will be ready for action asap.‚Äù

# ¬†

# Joe Hoover said, ‚ÄúI think that it would be a good idea to get the SAS involved, they are good at this desert fighting stuff aren‚Äôt they.‚Äù

# ¬†

# The meeting concluded with an agreement to get the SEALs ready to fly to the UK that night, Joe Hoover phoned Catherine Wright and informed her about the rescue plan.

# ¬†

# She immediately asked if he needed SAS assistance.¬†

# ¬†

# He said, ‚Äúof course, they would be a great help.‚Äù

# ¬†

# So, it was decided, a four-man team from the SAS would make a HALO jump that night, to do a recognisance of the camp, the guards, and the prisoners.¬†

# ¬†

# So that night, four men under the command of Scotty White, were taken by chopper to Heathrow and they boarded a flight ostentatiously headed for Paraguay, this necessitated a flight across the edge of the Western Desert.

# ¬†

# Once they were over the desert, the four-man team jumped into the inky blackness of the desert sky.

# ¬†

# HALO stands for ‚ÄúHigh Altitude Low Opening.‚Äù Tonight, they jumped from 35,000 feet, all were wearing oxygen masks and thick clothing to combat the freezing temperatures associated with high altitude.

# ¬†

# They were dropped ten miles away from their target and using the guide ropes on the parachutes were able to steer themselves closer to their target.¬†

# ¬†

# As soon as they left the plane, they could see the lights of the campfires marking their target, so they carefully steer towards them.

# ¬†

# When the altimeter was reading 800 feet, they pulled the cords, and their pure black parachutes blossomed above them.¬†

# ¬†

# They landed and quickly secured the area, one facing each direction, once they were sure that they hadn‚Äôt been discovered, Scotty got on the radio and sent a squirt message back to the UK,¬†

# ¬†

# A squirt message is a message that has been compressed and encrypted then sent, it can encrypt the bible down and send it in a message less than 10 seconds long.

# ¬†

# While he was sending the message, Dan Cotton, Billy Staverton, and Andy Broadman, was busy setting up a lying up position, and setting weapons just in case they got bumped.

# ¬†

# They didn‚Äôt light a fire, they knew that they would be on hard routine, i.e. no hot food, or hot drinks, no smoking etc.

# ¬†

# Before dawn, Billy, and Andy, made their way closer to the camp so they could get eyes on, to really log the comings and goings, it was hot lying in a scraped-out position in the sand under a canvas sheet, but they had been through worse.

# ¬†

# After a long day of getting bitten by sand fleas, when the sun went down, Billy and Andy left the scrape and returned to the LUP.

# ¬†

# The information they recovered was quickly sent back to the UK, meanwhile back in America, the SEALs were being flown by helicopter to Hurlburt Field, In Florida for the long flight to the UK aboard a C17 plane, the largest plane the US military possess.

# ¬†

# In the UK, a plan was being made, the SAS were put on standby, the plan was for them to be dropped ten miles away from the camp, complete with land rovers and motorcycles.

# ¬†

# They would land, travel across the desert to the LUP, rendezvous with Scotty and his team, then at three am, silently take out any sentry‚Äôs, take out any sleeping guards that they could, before it got noisy, i.e. somebody started firing.

# ¬†

# The SEALs arrived in the UK, and the following day they were ready to board their flight to the Western Sahara, they were going to meet up with the SAS at the forward rendezvous point.

# ¬†

# The SEALs would come in the left flank and the SAS on the right; the SAS took the side where the guard tents were situated.¬†

# ¬†

# All went according to plan, the two teams crept into the camp like desert wraiths, drifting from shadow to shadow, leaving behind them a trail of bodies.

# ¬†

# Finally, the two teams met at the outside of the prisoners' tents, they were being guarded by three guards, two of them were dozing, one was pacing nervously back and forth.

# ¬†

# Finally, he left his post, walked behind a tree, and started to relieve himself, a shadow rose behind him and silently placed a hand over his mouth¬†

# ¬†

# and stabbed him through the throat, then turned the knife and pushed the blade forward, ripping out his throat, without a throat, the guard couldn‚Äôt make a sound.

# ¬†

# The other two guards were dealt with the same way, then after the camp was secured, they entered the prisoners' tents.

# ¬†

# Inside they found that the prisoners had all been handcuffed the entire time they had be held prisoner, some of the female prisoners had been repeatedly raped.¬†

# ¬†

# Inside the male tent, most of the male prisoners had been beaten, all had black eyes, and other marks of ill treatment.

# ¬†

# In the female tent, they asked that Julie Craker could make herself known, a hand went up and a slim black woman rose to her feet.

# ¬†

# The head SEAL introduced himself, he said, ‚Äúma'am, I‚Äôm James Butler, Lieutenant US Navy SEALs, can I confirm if you are able to still fly.?‚Äù

# ¬†

# Julie forced a smile and said, ‚ÄúYou bet your sweet ass, I can.‚Äù

# ¬†

# James Butler made a call, and a fleet of Chinooks were soon on their way, Meanwhile the SAS were headed towards the town of Bir Anzerane, to take over the small settlement.

# ¬†

# This was soon accomplished, and then they started refilling the giant 747 ready for take-off. Soon the chinooks started to ferry the passengers to Bir Anzerane,¬†

# ¬†

# Julie Craker was among the first to board the plane, she quickly started the pre-flight checks as more and more of the passengers were boarding the plane.

# ¬†

# Among the last to board was a figure who was struggling against his handcuffs, it was a very disheveled looking James Boyle, the captain who had flown the plane when it had left Dulles airport.

# ¬†

# He was unceremoniously dumped in a seat and was strapped into place using cable ties. As he kept swearing and cursing, one of the SEALs shoved a napkin in his mouth.

# ¬†

# As the sun was rising, flight 0745 taxied across to the road, accelerated to take-off speed and lifted off into the morning sun, as the wheel lifted off the tarmac, there was a resounding cheer from the passengers.

# ¬†

# As the plane reached cruising altitude, they were joined by a flight of Eurofighters from the RAF.

# ¬†

# They escorted flight 0745 to Heathrow, as soon as they were within range of Ireland, the control tower said, ‚ÄúWelcome home flight 0745, We‚Äôve missed you.‚Äù

# ¬†

# They landed at Heathrow to a hero‚Äôs welcome, Julie Craker was treated like a heroine, the passengers were escorted off the plane and into a large room where they could phone relatives etc.

# ¬†

# Emily Hoover was taken to a private room where she phoned her father for a very tearful reunion, but the meeting that James Boyle was in was not so pleasant.

# ¬†

# He was taken from the flight, shove into a car with blacked out window and driven to Grosvenor Sq. in central London, to the American Embassy.¬†

# ¬†

# In the basement are several rooms where rather robust questioning is carried out, these rooms are soundproof and as they are part of the American Embassy, they are classed as American soil, So the UK laws don‚Äôt apply there.

# ¬†

# Back at Heathrow, Julie Craker was interviewed about what happened on the flight, during the flight, she was taking a nap, when James Boyle had suddenly turned the oxygen level down causing everybody on board to pass out,¬†

# ¬†

# When she had awoken, she was handcuffed to her seat, and they were flying at about 200 feet above the sea, James was talking to somebody in a language that she didn‚Äôt understand.

# ¬†

# After landing, he maneuvered the plane of the road he had landed on and onto the sand beside it, James then opened the door and several men entered the plane, they were carrying guns.

# ¬†

# We were all taken off the plane and loaded onto lorries, driven across the sand until we reached the oasis, that is where they had set up a camp for us.

# ¬†

# Her voice broke as she said, ‚Äúduring the time we were being held, all of the women were repeatedly raped.‚Äù

# ¬†

# After hearing this, the woman talking to her, opened her arms and gave Julie a hug, as the two stood there, the tears were flowing, from both of them.¬†

# ¬†

# The authorities made arrangements for all the women from the flight were given counselling to get them through the ordeal of 1, being held hostage, 2, being repeatedly raped. Each woman was also tested for any STDs.

# ¬†

# Back in the Western Desert, the SAS and SEALs were clearing up before being extraction back to the UK, the bodies and camp were searched before the two teams left on the Chinooks.

# ¬†

# Before they left, they removed any information they had gathered, then left a laser pointer in the middle of the camp, thirty minutes after they left, a missile guided by the laser pointer impacted in the centre of the camp obliterating everything within a 500-yard radius.

# ¬†

# The chinooks landed back in Germany, refueled, and flew on to the UK. From there the SAS returned to Stirling lines at Hereford and the SEALs after a night's sleep, returned to their base in the USA.

Okay besties, buckle up because I‚Äôm losing my mind.

I met an old school friend today after ages, and we‚Äôre just casually catching up‚Äîuntil she hits me with a plot twist straight out of a Wattpad fanfic:

> ‚ÄúYou know when you left school, there were rumours the topper had a crush on you?‚Äù



I blink. Confused. Laugh nervously.
Because hello? I used to have the biggest crush on him.
Like, heart-skipping-a-beat-when-he-spoke kind of crush.
But I always thought he liked my friend. Every time I caught him glancing over in class, I was convinced it was her. So I let it go, thinking it was all in my head.

BUT WAIT‚Äîplot twist incoming‚Äî
My friend straight up asked him back then, and this boy CONFESSED.
He actually liked me. üò≠ I‚Äôm not okay.

Now my entire memory reel from school is playing in a new light:

That one group project he mysteriously ended up in?

Those subtle glances I brushed off?

How he‚Äôd always sit just close enough to notice me?


I MISREAD EVERYTHING. I was too busy thinking I wasn‚Äôt the one‚Ä¶ when I was.

Here‚Äôs the catch though:
He‚Äôs a ghost now. No social media. No number. Nobody seems to be in touch with him. The universe gave me the most delicious piece of information and then dipped like it was just dropping an emotional teaser trailer.

But despite all that? I‚Äôm weirdly euphoric. This might be the first time I‚Äôve ever found out someone genuinely liked me for who I was‚Äîwithout me trying, without filters, without knowing it.

It makes me feel soft. Beautiful. Seen. ü•π
And yeah‚Ä¶ maybe a tiny part of me is manifesting some random, slow-motion coffee shop reunion where we lock eyes and everything just clicks. Because a girl can hope, right?

Anyway. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever see him again. But damn‚Ä¶ this feeling? I‚Äôm holding onto it. Universe, if you're listening‚ÄîI'm ready for the sequel. ‚ú®üíå

She said like? around 12? Anyway it felt awkward.

Today she got up and made coffee for herself I was on the couch. We said hi. Then we were on our phones. She said do you have any updates on the lift? Am I overreacting to her boundaries or was her delivery unnecessarily rude. I understand needing time for yourself but I felt the way she went about it was quite abrupt and cold.

1m9rsg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m9rsg3/can_you_drive_the_circumference_of_oahu/,Can you drive the circumference of Oahu?,"Just got back from an incredible Circle Island Tour of Oahu, and I need to share my experience. I've visited Hawaii multiple times, but this was hands down the best way to see the entire island in one day.

Many people ask if you can drive around Oahu's circumference - yes, you absolutely can! The island is roughly 112 miles around, and you can cover the main highlights in about 8 hours. While you could rent a car and do it yourself, I found that taking a guided tour was way more relaxing and informative.

I booked this Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) after reading hundreds of positive reviews, and it exceeded my expectations. Our local guide knew every hidden spot and shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture and history that I would've missed driving solo.

The tour started in Waikiki early morning, which was perfect because we beat the crowds at popular spots. Our first stop was Diamond Head lookout - the views of the coastline were breathtaking. Then we visited Halona Blowhole, where waves shoot water up to 30 feet high through ancient lava tubes.

The North Shore was a highlight - we stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and got to try the legendary garlic shrimp from local food trucks. Don't skip this, seriously some of the best food I've had.

Waimea Valley was incredible. The botanical garden has over 5,000 tropical plants, and the waterfall at the end is something else. Pro tip: bring your swimsuit. Swimming under a Hawaiian waterfall is bucket list material.

What really made the tour worth it:
- No stress about navigation or parking
- Expert local knowledge
- All entrance fees included
- Convenient hotel pickup/drop-off
- Small group size (max 24 people)
- Coffee and macadamia nut tastings included

Cost-wise, at $154 per person, it's actually pretty reasonable considering everything that's included. Plus, you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change.

Final thoughts: If you're planning to explore Oahu, this circle island tour is the way to go. It's comprehensive, well-organized, and you'll see way more than you could on your own. Book through this link (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) - they often have special rates and I found their booking process super smooth.

Quick packing tips for the tour:
- Comfortable walking shoes
- Swimwear and towel
- Camera
- Cash for lunch and souvenirs
- Sunscreen and hat
- Water bottle

Trust me, this tour will give you the full Oahu experience in just one day. The combination of scenic spots, cultural insights, and local treats makes it worth every penny.",1,1753531918.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False
1m9rrx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1m9rrx9/luxury_hotel_brands_arent_as_consistent_as_you/,Luxury hotel brands aren‚Äôt as consistent as you think...,"One thing that‚Äôs become super clear to me over the last few years of work travel‚Äîespecially to cities like London‚Äîis that you really can‚Äôt trust brand names alone when booking luxury hotels.

Everyone assumes Aman, Four Seasons, Rosewood, etc. are guaranteed wins. But not all properties are created equal. Some are amazing. Others feel like a dressed-up chain hotel with good lighting and $20 bottled water. I've had FS stays that felt like a dream, and others where I had to chase down someone just to get coffee before 7am.

Honestly, the brand name is just a starting point. You have to go property by property. Reviews, recent management changes, whether it's geared toward leisure or business‚Äîall of that matters more than the logo on the front door.

For incentive trips or team retreats, I‚Äôve even started looking beyond hotels entirely. Private villas, buyouts, charters‚Äîyou get way more control and far fewer surprises.

Just before turning 70, Efren Reyes finally said what he never needed to shout: I‚Äôll be 70 next March. 

I never chased cameras. Never needed bodyguards. 

Never stopped calling it just a game. I was never the loud one in the room. I didn‚Äôt wear gold chains or demand an entourage. I just let the cue speak for me. And when it did, people listened.

I grew up in Angeles, playing pool in dusty halls with cracked balls and cigarette smoke in the air. We didn‚Äôt have sponsors, we had instincts. I learned to aim not just with my eyes, but with my gut. I remember sleeping under pool tables as a kid, dreaming not of trophies‚Ä¶ but of meals. We hustled, because we had to. I was never promised greatness. I just kept showing up. 

At 30, I became ‚ÄúThe Magician.‚Äù They called me that because I made shots no one saw coming. But to me, they weren‚Äôt magic. They were just possibilities others hadn‚Äôt looked for yet.

At 40, I beat the best in the world. Americans, Brits, anyone with swagger. I smiled. Shook hands. Then went home to eat with my family.

At 50, I started losing more. Reflexes slowed. Eyes got tired. But the love for the game? Still sharp. I‚Äôd show up at bar tournaments where half the crowd didn‚Äôt know they were playing with a legend.

At 60, I stopped playing to win. I played to teach. I played to remind the next generation: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need noise to prove you‚Äôre great. Let your cue do the talking.‚Äù

Now, nearly 70, I spend my days watching the sun rise slow over rice fields. I teach kids to line up shots, and sometimes, I let them win. I tell stories, the quiet kind, over coffee and warm pan de sal. 

If I could tell you one thing, it‚Äôs this: A humble life is not a small one. Not everyone needs to dominate. Some of us are here to outlast. To endure. To watch. To teach. To take the shot when it feels right and walk away smiling, win or lose.

There‚Äôs dignity in silence. There‚Äôs wisdom in restraint. And sometimes, the strongest hand on the table‚Ä¶ is the one that knows when to let go. With calm and chalk-stained fingers (Efren ‚ÄúBata‚Äù Reyes, 2025).",2,1753531814.0,billiards,0,1.0,False

Not shrinking violet-just... Quiet. I often felt that I needed to strive to be most talkative, outgoing, visible to see myself as fit in. However, as I have matured, travelled, got exposed to different cultures and gotten time to reflect, I have been introduced to the idea that being introverted is not something that one should look to correct but rather something to understand and take pride in.

I prefer solitary trips, going to the unknown streets, wearing headphones, and getting lost in a cafe where nobody recognises me. I love creating something: websites, concepts, dreams. I am a programmer who cannot live without logic; see beauty in code; and is excited about resolving problems. I am also a highly spiritual individual and faith is what keeps my feet on the ground whenever life seems to be too loud or unstable.

Small moments of happiness are my life: the right soundtrack at work, a coffee that was made exactly right, a time of intense concentration, or a good conversation that does not involve, but jumps right to substance.

After two hours I did and replied. When he called me we stayed in the call after that, one of my shows has begun so I defeaned the call because I was on speakers and I put my phone charging as well. After that, I undeafened said I slept so did he. When we said goodnight. Then after that, in the morning the sound of something talking in the background in the call coming from him, woke me up so I defeaned to go back to sleep. Then he had to argue with me because he was annoyed thinking I'm acting weird because I defeaned he left the call and refused to come back, I literally don't know what I did I just told him I defeaned because some noise woke me up from a deep sleep and my eyes are still closed while typing to him, I told him what's the problem? That he always defean or mute me when my background makes noise or anything like that, he literally told me the day before that the sound of me joining the call woke him up and irritated him next time if I left I don't need to come back until he wakes up. I found that super rude yet I didn't say anything to it. But he had to go like a crazy on me by saying I'm acting weird and suspicious by defeaning and not answering him yesterday for two hours.

1m9rq8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1m9rq8e/does_the_oxo_rapid_brewer_redefine_portable/,Does the OXO Rapid Brewer Redefine Portable Coffee Making?,"The OXO Rapid Brewer, model 8722500, quickly piqued my curiosity when I stumbled upon it. As someone who values a good cup of coffee but isn't keen on waiting forever or relying on inconsistent coffee shops, I decided to give this manual coffee maker a try. After using it daily for the past few weeks, I must admit, there‚Äôs a lot to love about this unique device, but also a few quirks worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This portable coffee maker won me over with its sleek, compact design. It stands at about 10.5 inches tall and is surprisingly lightweight at just over a pound. Tossing it into my backpack felt like carrying a thermos, not a full-fledged appliance, which made it perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle. Its black finish lends a timeless elegance, and the materials feel sturdy and solid. What added an eco-friendly bonus was the use of Tritan Renew in its build‚Äîclaimed to be 50% recycled content, which is a nice touch for the environmentally conscious. From the rainmaker showerhead that ensures even flavor extraction to the built-in tamper, it‚Äôs clear a lot of thought went into crafting this coffee maker.

**Ease of Use**  
Making coffee with the OXO Rapid Brewer reminded me just how satisfying manual brewing can be. It‚Äôs incredibly straightforward: add finely ground coffee, tamp it down, pour water to the fill line, and wait a couple of minutes. For hot concentrated brews, you'd only wait about two minutes, while cold brew does take a little longer‚Äîaround five minutes. Once ready, a quick quarter turn of the pump unlocks it, letting you dispense your brew into the carafe. The locked pump also ensures zero spills during storage or transport. These small features collectively streamline the process, and I appreciated not needing electricity or batteries to operate it.  

**[Check OXO Rapid Brewer price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)**  

**Versatility & Flavor**  
Coffee lovers will find this brewer to be impressively versatile. By producing a concentrated coffee base, it lets you whip up a wide variety of drinks. On a chilly morning, I kept it simple by diluting the concentrate with water for a hot Americano. On warmer days, I loved making iced coffee or cold brew‚Äîit resulted in a smooth, low-acid flavor. Feeling adventurous one weekend, I even mixed up a Vietnamese-style cold brew; the concentrated coffee was simply perfect as the base. Once, my nephew insisted I pour it over ice cream for an affogato dessert, and let me just say, it was a delightful treat. Flavor-wise, the Rapid Brewer doesn‚Äôt disappoint‚Äîa rich, consistent extraction every time, just as promised.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning this coffee maker has been surprisingly easy. With nearly all components being dishwasher-safe (except the pump), there's a minimal hassle involved. I usually rinse the pump with some warm water after each use to prevent buildup, and that‚Äôs about it. The stainless steel filter is a brilliant idea as it eliminates the need for messy paper filters, reducing waste and saving me a few bucks. Considering I despise kitchen gadgets that are complicated to clean, this was a winner for me in this department.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight and portable; perfect for travel or a clutter-free kitchen.  
- Enables brewing of both hot and cold concentrated coffee within minutes.  
- Stainless steel filter eliminates the fuss of paper filters.  
- Outstanding versatility; make everything from an Americano to an affogato.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Coffee preparation can be slightly messy, especially during the pumping process if you're not careful.  
- Since it‚Äôs a manual brewer, it requires a bit more effort and involvement compared to automated machines.  
- Not ideal for preparing large quantities in one go; better suited for single servings.  

**Competitive Options**  
In the realm of portable coffee makers, it's often compared to AeroPress or traditional French presses. While the AeroPress offers a similar compact style, it relies heavily on extra paper filters, which adds recurring expenses over time. On the other hand, French presses may provide a simpler process but lack the rapid brewing mechanism and versatility of concentrated coffee. Where the Rapid Brewer shines is its ability to go beyond traditional methods, offering both speedy brews and the capacity to craft diverse coffee drinks. I noticed the rainmaker showerhead feature also helped with better flavor extraction compared to other manual options, leaving competitors feeling a little outdated.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The price range seemed entirely reasonable given what this brewer delivers. It's a strong investment for anyone who values customizable coffee drinks and needs a portable yet effective solution. When compared to the cost of a month's worth of coffee shop visits, it practically pays for itself. Some buyers might consider automated machines for convenience, but for those who enjoy the process of brewing and have a knack for experimenting with coffee, this coffee maker provides considerable financial and quality benefits.

I grew up in a small town in the Midlands. Dad was a machinist, mum worked part-time at a pharmacy. Money was always tight. I wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúgifted kid‚Äù type. barely scraped through community college doing a btec in plumbing before pivoting into IT certifications and then slowly into software.

Taught myself to code at 22. It started with silly little automation scripts, then freelancing, then building tiny apps. In 2016, I launched a super niche SaaS tool for property managers. Nothing flashy, just handled vendor scheduling, quote approvals, maintenance tickets, etc.

I was solo for 3 years, handling dev, support, billing, everything. Eventually hired one part-time dev, then another. Grew slowly. No VC, no debt, just monthly revenue reinvested into the product. It hit ¬£70k MRR by 2021. Then ¬£180k MRR by 2023. Last year, a bigger firm reached out to acquire it. Multiple offers followed. I sold in March.

Total deal was ¬£14.2M with a clean exit clause. After taxes, advisors, and options I granted to my tiny team, I walked away with ¬£9.6M in cash.

What‚Äôs surreal:

I still live in the same 2-bed flat I bought in 2019. No mortgage. No car loan. No credit card debt. I sent ¬£250k to my folks so they could retire early. I bought my brother a coffee shop he always dreamed of owning. I took 6 friends who stuck with me through the grind to Japan for 2 weeks, my treat.

No Lambos. No watches. Just peace, time, and options.

I‚Äôm currently working on a new app. Might invest in indie devs like me. No rush.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm special. I just kept building when no one cared.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing so far:

Emmi Midtown:

‚úÖ Beautiful building with really great reviews
‚úÖ Amenities are top-notch, and the gym is one of the best I‚Äôve seen so far
‚úÖ Has a community feel with regular resident events 
‚ùå Units are a little smaller - I‚Äôm finding it tough to figure out where my desk would comfortably fit
‚ùå It‚Äôs on Spring Street, which seems like it could get really busy with traffic  

Loria Ansley:

‚úÖ Brand new building with larger units (the A6 floor plan with the seperate home office/den space right next to a window is what drew me in - I work from home so that‚Äôs huge)
‚úÖ Regular resident events and other perks like a run club and wine club
‚úÖ Some unique amenities like a pickleball court and they plan to open a coffee shop in the building in the fall 
‚ùå Still feels kind of empty - only like ~31% occupied
‚ùå Not a lot of reviews to go off of yet
‚ùå Gym is smaller
‚ùå A bit pricier than Emmi

Are my feelings valid?,"Last night I went to bed a little early (around 11) and woke up around 2am. I saw my gfs phone open with her and her freind  Savannah‚Äôs Snapchat open. I wasn‚Äôt going to go though anything just reached to close it for her, until I saw a text from my gf saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been tempted to, there was this guy who came in just to see me. We talked for like an hour and I wanted to give him my number so bad.‚Äù She is a bar tender and I expect guys to hit on her as she is very attractive and that just normally what guys at bars do.

Well I caved and read the rest of the text. Savannah who is in a 2 year relationship has a regular come into the coffee shop she works at and apparently thinks he is really hot. Well she was trying to find him on social media and was telling my gf all about it. I think my gf was trying to relate to her by sharing her experiences of being tempted. Because My gf also said in the text ‚Äú I‚Äôve had a guy with two lambos hit me up, that was very tempting.‚Äù 

I understand that people can be tempted or attracted to other people, it‚Äôs just how things are. But I feel that the line is drawn at that.

1m9rgbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m9rgbl/his_celebrity_mistresss_downfall/,His Celebrity Mistress's Downfall,"I gave up my twenty-billion-dollar inheritance and cut ties with my family, all for my boyfriend of five years, Ignatz.

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.

He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.

When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.

""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""

He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.

He knew. And he still sent me.

I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.

My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.

""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""

Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""

The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.

Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.

""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""

I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.

""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""

""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""

My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""

""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""

I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""

""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""

He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.

""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.

He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""

""I'm pr\*\*nant.""

The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.

Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.

""No,"" he said.

""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""

He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""

I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""

""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""

""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""

He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""

My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""

The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.

""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""

""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""

I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""

Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.

Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.

""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""

His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.

He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.

""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""

Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.

The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.

She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.

""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""

The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.

He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.

I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.

I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.

And then I felt it.

A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.

Don't let me go.

""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.

The nurse turned, surprised.

""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""

I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.

Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.

The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""

The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.

Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.

""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""

""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""

""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""

I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.

I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.

""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""

I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.

""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""

Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.

The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.

There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.

It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.

Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""

Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.

""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""

I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""

He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""

He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.

""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""

I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.

I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.

I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.

Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.

""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.

He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.

""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""

I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.

Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""

Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""

""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""

Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""

For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.

The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.

Then I walked into the kitchen.

Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.

They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.

Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""

""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""

""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.

The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.

""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""

I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.

""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""

My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.

Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""

Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.

""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.

I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.

He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""

""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.

""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""

He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.

My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.

This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.

Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.

I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.

Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.

Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.

I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.

""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""

I had thought he meant me.

Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.

When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.

""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.

""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""

The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.

I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.

Whispers erupted around me.

""Is that her? The stalker?""

""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""

I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.

Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.

I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.

""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.

Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""

She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""

Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.

Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.

I stood there, silent.

Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""

""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""

I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.

He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""

""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""

""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""

""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.

Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.

Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""

I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.

I went down, hard.

My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.

I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.

""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""

He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.

Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.

I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.

With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.

I didn't even look for it.

Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.

I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.

""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.

I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.

""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""

Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.

Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.

My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.

""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""

The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.

Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.

Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.

""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.

Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.

""What are you doing? She's my patient!""

""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.

They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.

""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.

I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.

Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""

I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""

""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""

""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""

There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""

The line went dead.

Hope died with it.

They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.

Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.

No. No, no, no.

Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.

""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""

I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""

""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""

The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.

I was alone.

I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.

When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""

The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.

As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.

I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.

A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.

A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.

I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.

I pressed the call button.

It rang twice.

""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""

""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""

""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""

1m9re55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1m9re55/his_celebrity_mistresss_downfall/,His Celebrity Mistress's Downfall,"I gave up my twenty-billion-dollar inheritance and cut ties with my family, all for my boyfriend of five years, Ignatz.  
  
But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.  
  
He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.  
  
When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.  
  
""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""  
  
He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.  
  
He knew. And he still sent me.  
  
I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.  
  
My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.  
  
""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""  
  
  
Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""  
  
The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.  
  
Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.  
  
""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""  
  
I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.  
  
""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""  
  
""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""  
  
My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""  
  
""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""  
  
I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""  
  
""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""  
  
He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.  
  
""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.  
  
He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""  
  
""I'm pr\*\*nant.""  
  
The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.  
  
Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.  
  
""No,"" he said.  
  
""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""  
  
He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""  
  
I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""  
  
""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""  
  
""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""  
  
He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""  
  
My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""  
  
""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""  
  
The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.  
  
""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""  
  
""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""  
  
I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.  
  
""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""  
  
Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.  
  
Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.  
  
""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""  
  
His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.  
  
He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.  
  
""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""  
  
Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.  
  
The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.  
  
She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.  
  
""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""  
  
The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.  
  
He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.  
  
I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.  
  
I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.  
  
And then I felt it.  
  
A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.  
  
Don't let me go.  
  
""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.  
  
The nurse turned, surprised.  
  
""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""  
  
I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.  
  
Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.  
  
The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""  
  
The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.  
  
Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.  
  
""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""  
  
""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""  
  
""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""  
  
I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.  
  
I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.  
  
""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""  
  
I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.  
  
""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.  
  
The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.  
  
There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.  
  
It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.  
  
Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""  
  
Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.  
  
""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""  
  
I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""  
  
He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""  
  
He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.  
  
""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""  
  
I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.  
  
I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.  
  
I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.  
  
Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.  
  
""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.  
  
He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.  
  
""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""  
  
I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.  
  
Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""  
  
Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""  
  
""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""  
  
Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""  
  
For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.  
  
The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.  
  
Then I walked into the kitchen.  
  
Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.  
  
They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.  
  
Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""  
  
""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""  
  
""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.  
  
The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.  
  
""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""  
  
I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.  
  
""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""  
  
My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.  
  
Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""  
  
Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.  
  
""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.  
  
I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.  
  
He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""  
  
He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""  
  
""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.  
  
""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""  
  
He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.  
  
My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.  
  
This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.  
  
I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.  
  
Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.  
  
Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.  
  
I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.  
  
""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""  
  
I had thought he meant me.  
  
Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.  
  
When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.  
  
""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.  
  
""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""  
  
The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.  
  
I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.  
  
Whispers erupted around me.  
  
""Is that her? The stalker?""  
  
""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""  
  
I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.  
  
Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.  
  
I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.  
  
""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.  
  
Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""  
  
She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""  
  
Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.  
  
Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.  
  
I stood there, silent.  
  
Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""  
  
""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""  
  
I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.  
  
He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""  
  
""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""  
  
""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""  
  
""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.  
  
Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.  
  
Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""  
  
I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.  
  
I went down, hard.  
  
My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.  
  
I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.  
  
""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""  
  
He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.  
  
Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.  
  
I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.  
  
With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.  
  
I didn't even look for it.  
  
Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.  
  
I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.  
  
""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.  
  
I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.  
  
""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""  
  
  
Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.  
  
Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.  
  
My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.  
  
""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""  
  
The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.  
  
Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.  
  
Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.  
  
""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.  
  
Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.  
  
""What are you doing? She's my patient!""  
  
""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.  
  
They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.  
  
""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.  
  
I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.  
  
Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""  
  
I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""  
  
""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""  
  
""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""  
  
There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
Hope died with it.  
  
They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.  
  
Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.  
  
No. No, no, no.  
  
Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.  
  
""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""  
  
I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""  
  
""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""  
  
The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.  
  
I was alone.  
  
I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.  
  
When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""  
  
The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.  
  
As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.  
  
I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.  
  
A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.  
  
A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.  
  
I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.  
  
I pressed the call button.  
  
It rang twice.  
  
""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""  
  
""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""  
  
""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""

Age 21
COFFEE SHOP. LATE MORNING.


The place was small, tucked into a side street off campus.

Maya liked it for the oat milk and the minimalism.

Dashiell liked it because it was quiet.

Predictable.

He sat across from her, fingers wrapped around a paper cup, listening as she talked about her residency rotation.

‚ÄúThey let me shadow an emergency response,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt made me feel like I could do this forever.‚Äù

He smiled.

Nodded.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.‚Äù

She sipped. Watched him.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. 
Just thinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow rare it is to find something that makes sense.‚Äù

She reached across the table.

‚ÄúWe make sense.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer.

But he didn‚Äôt pull away.


----


Maeve and Lachlan sat at opposite ends of the couch.

The room smelled like tea and wood polish.

Fraya sprawled on the rug, flipping through a notebook.

Dashiell stood in front of them with a small box in his hand.

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù 

Maeve asked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good. 
Smart. 
Kind.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I asked.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

He opened the box.

The ring caught the lamplight.

‚ÄúI think I want to build something.‚Äù

Lachlan nodded once.

Fraya looked up.

‚ÄúDoes Joaquim know?‚Äù

A beat.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dashiell said.

‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù


-----



The station was quiet after the callout.

Gear hung still.

Boots drying by the heater.

Coffee burned in the pot-no one drank it.

Dashiell sat in the recliner that was permanently tilted back too far, one boot untied, staring at his phone.

Maya‚Äôs text glowed on the screen:

Dinner tonight at my sister‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt be late this time.

He smiled without thinking.

But the smile didn‚Äôt reach his spine.

‚ÄúShe giving you grief again?‚Äù

That was Trevor, his closest friend on the team.

Dashiell shrugged.

‚ÄúNah. 
She‚Äôs just planning. 
That‚Äôs how she shows love.‚Äù

Trevor smirked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good for you, man. 
You‚Äôve been more grounded since she showed up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

But grounded didn‚Äôt mean rooted.

And Dashiell felt the difference now more than ever.


-----


The table was full of noise-forks on porcelain, stories passed like second helpings.

Maya‚Äôs sister poured wine with one hand, balanced a toddler on her hip with the other.

Dashiell sat between Maya and her dad, nodding in the right places, smiling at the toddler‚Äôs spaghetti-smeared face.

‚ÄúDashiell,‚Äù Maya‚Äôs dad said, 

‚ÄúI keep hearing about you.

Firehouse golden boy, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust trying to keep up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got that look. 
Steady hands. 
Good instincts.‚Äù

Maya slipped her hand over his thigh under the table.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got good taste.‚Äù

Everyone laughed.

Except Dashiell.

He smiled, but something in his ribs pulled tight.


----


The lamp cast long shadows across the ceiling.

Maya slept beside him, turned toward the wall.

Her back rose and fell in the rhythm of someone who trusted the silence.

Dashiell lay flat on his back, wide-eyed.

His mind went to Joaquim-of course it did.

He remembered the way Joa held eye contact when things got uncomfortable.

The way he folded a napkin corner when he was nervous.

The way his voice dropped when he talked about sky like it was church.

He hadn‚Äôt told Joaquim about Maya‚Äôs family dinner.

He hadn‚Äôt told Joaquim about Maya‚Äôs dad.

He hadn‚Äôt told Joaquim about the ring.

Not yet.



-----


The shop smelled like velvet and old air conditioning.

Glass cases glimmered under halogen light.

Rings sat in neat rows, sparkling quietly like they were watching.

Dashiell stood at the counter in his station uniform-boots laced, sleeves rolled.

A nervous bead of sweat formed at the back of his neck.

The clerk, a man in his fifties with soft hands and patient eyes, gestured to a case of engagement bands.

‚ÄúAny particular style you‚Äôre looking for?‚Äù

‚ÄúSimple.

Strong.

Nothing that pretends to be more than it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúClassic solitaire?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

The ring he picked wasn‚Äôt flashy.

It didn‚Äôt scream.

It sat there like it was waiting for the right story.

‚ÄúWant it engraved?‚Äù

Dashiell thought about it.

Thought of Maya‚Äôs favorite quote.

Thought of her laugh.

Then thought of Joaquim‚Äôs silence the last time they spoke.

The way it said, I‚Äôll wait, even if I don‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dashiell said.

‚ÄúI think the story‚Äôs still writing itself.‚Äù

He paid in cash.

-----


Maeve sat at the table grading papers, glasses low on her nose.

Lachlan poured tea.

Fraya scrolled in the corner, pretending not to listen.

Dashiell held the ring box in one hand.

‚ÄúShe makes me feel like I‚Äôm building something real,‚Äù 
he said.

‚ÄúLike there‚Äôs a blueprint and I finally understand the tools.‚Äù

Maeve didn‚Äôt look up.

‚ÄúWhat about the parts that weren‚Äôt on the blueprint?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike the parts you only tell Joaquim.‚Äù

Dashiell went still.

Fraya glanced up.

‚ÄúDoes he even know you‚Äôre doing this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause if I tell him‚Ä¶

I think I‚Äôll see it in his eyes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat I‚Äôm not being honest.
That I‚Äôm building someone else‚Äôs life instead of living mine.‚Äù

Maeve set down her pen.

‚ÄúYou can still love someone and choose wrong.‚Äù

Lachlan added gently:

‚ÄúAnd you can still be brave enough to walk away.‚Äù

Dashiell opened the box.

Stared at the ring like it held an answer.



-----


The apartment was lit by the soft glow of string lights.

Takeout containers lined the counter, pad thai, satay, mango salad untouched.

Maya stood barefoot by the window, her hair pulled back, wine glass in one hand, a record humming faintly behind her.

Dashiell watched her from across the room.

She looked calm.

Rooted.

He felt‚Ä¶ adrift.
But he moved anyway.

Pulled the ring box from his jacket.

Held it in one hand behind his back.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù 
Maya asked.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúDangerous.‚Äù

She smiled.

He didn‚Äôt.
Instead,
He stepped forward.

Took her hand.

‚ÄúYou said something last week. About building a life. 
About knowing what love looks like.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

He got down on one knee.
She gasped softly.
Eyes wide.

Hope full.

And Dashiell?

He smiled.

But his eyes searched the room, like maybe Joaquim was somehow watching.

‚ÄúI want to try,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what comes after. But I want to try, with you.‚Äù

She nodded, tears in her eyes.

‚ÄúYes.
Of course, yes.‚Äù

She pulled him into her arms.

The ring slipped onto her finger.
Music swelled.

And still,
his breath never quite caught.

üîâ ADULT DASHIELL

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt lying.
I just didn‚Äôt realize the truth had already left the room.‚Äù


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã




 The Door He Shouldn‚Äôt Have Opened
Age 21
FIREHOUSE: NIGHT SHIFT ENDS


The scent of smoke still clung to his jacket.

Dashiell unhooked his turnout gear, hung it gently, checked the hooks twice.

His hands ached.

Back sore.

Heart tired.

Trevor, his closest firehouse friend, clapped him on the back.

‚ÄúYou good for tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. 
Maya‚Äôs making something weird with lentils.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan, she loves feeding you like a saint.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou lucked out, bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He meant it.
He thought he did.

----



MAYA‚ÄôS APARTMENT: LATER THAT NIGHT.


The hallway smelled like someone else‚Äôs burnt toast.

He pressed his key into the lock, turned it slowly.

He didn‚Äôt knock.

They‚Äôd gotten past knocking months ago.

Inside,
the living room lamp was on.

Maya‚Äôs coat was still on the back of the chair.

Music was playing, something funky, low, indulgent.

He smiled.

‚ÄúBabe?‚Äù

No answer.

He walked down the hall.

The bedroom door cracked open.
He pushed it gently.

What he saw hit him like the backdraft he‚Äôd trained his whole life to avoid.

Trevor.

On his knees.

Maya.

Hands in his hair.

Both of them froze.

Trevor‚Äôs eyes wide.

Maya‚Äôs lips parted, not in pleasure anymore, but in panic.

Dashiell stepped back.

Once.
Twice.

‚ÄúD...‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù

His voice didn‚Äôt shake.

It stopped.
He turned.

Walked.

He didn‚Äôt slam the door.
Didn‚Äôt say a word.
But inside?

Something burned clean through.

-----

JOAQUIM‚ÄôS APARTMENT. 
ONE HOUR LATER


Joaquim opened the door in sleep clothes, confusion on his face, until he saw the look in Dashiell‚Äôs eyes.

Torn.
Bloodshot.

Open.
Dashiell stepped inside.

Didn‚Äôt say anything.
Joaquim wrapped his arms around him.

Held on.
Tight.

Like he‚Äôd been waiting.
Like he knew.

Minutes passed without speaking.

After an hour.

And then,
The words came.

‚ÄúShe cheated.
With Trevor.

I walked in on it.‚Äù

Joaquim didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to be angry.
I wanted to break something.
But all I could think was:

I wanted to be with you anyway.‚Äù

Joaquim froze.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Dashiell sat down.

Rubbed his face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to build a future that looked right.

But the only time I ever felt safe in it... was when you were in the picture.‚Äù

‚ÄúD-‚Äù

‚ÄúNot as a romance. 
Not at first.
But as a home.

A truth.
A family.‚Äù

He looked up.
Eyes glassy.

Voice shaking.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it.
Let‚Äôs raise kids.

Let‚Äôs build something.

You fly. 
I fight fires.

But we come home to the same table.

You and me.‚Äù

Silence.
Then,
Joaquim:

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Dashiell blinked.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt want part of you.
I want all of you.

I want every version.

The one who kissed me.

The one who ran when it scared him.

The one who just got broken.
I want you.‚Äù

Silence.
Then:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give you all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I can‚Äôt say yes.‚Äù

He walked away.

Tears burning.

Not from anger.

From truth.

But he didn‚Äôt slam the door.
Because he wanted it open.


-----


Age 21
JOAQUIM‚ÄôS APARTMENT. A WEEK LATER


The apartment was clean.

Too clean.

Joaquim stood at the sink, drying the same mug for the fourth time.

The sky outside was bruised with rain.

His phone sat face down on the counter, quiet.

Since he left Dashiell‚Äôs apartment that night,
he hadn‚Äôt called.

Hadn‚Äôt texted.

But his chest hadn‚Äôt stopped aching.

Not because of the menory of the kiss.

Not because of the silence.

But because Dashiell had offered him everything, and he had been too scared to see it.

That night, he opened his journal.

Wrote only one line:

I said no because I was waiting for him to say yes the way I needed.

But maybe he already did.

-----


FIREHOUSE. MIDNIGHT SHIFT


Dashiell sat on the cot, flipping his helmet over in his hands.

The weight of it felt different now.

His phone buzzed.

A photo:

Joaquim at the airport, uniform crisp, standing in front of a small commercial jet.

Caption:

I thought about the table.

I‚Äôm ready to come home to it.

Then:

Yes.

Dashiell stared at it.

Smiled.

Closed his eyes.

Exhaled.

And whispered,
‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù


------



JOAQUIM‚ÄôS BEDROOM. NEXT DAY


They stood facing each other.

No big speech.
No theatrics.

Just two men who had run out of ways to say almost and finally chose to say forever.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs build it,‚Äù 
Joaquim said.

‚ÄúWe will,‚Äù 
Dashiell replied.

They didn‚Äôt kiss.
They didn‚Äôt need to.

They walked into the next room.

Together.

The first bricks of The Promise already underfoot.


üîâADULT JOQUIM

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a wedding.
It was a choice.

And he gave me everything.

Not in the way I asked.

But in the way that mattered most.

And I‚Äôve never stopped saying yes since.‚Äù


‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã


The Table Before the Home.
JOAQUIM‚ÄôS DINING ROOM. EVENING.


The table was nothing special.

Secondhand.

Scratched at the corners.

Wobbled slightly unless you wedged a folded coaster beneath the back left leg.

But tonight?

It felt like the center of the universe.

Joaquim lit a single candle in the center, not for romance, but for ritual.

He poured tea.
Not wine.

They wanted clarity.

Dashiell entered barefoot, fresh from the shower, hoodie half-zipped, hair still damp.

He looked like someone willing.

‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù 
Joaquim asked.

‚ÄúOnly if we tell the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

They sat across from each other.

No playlist.

No phones.

The candle flickered in its little ceramic bowl, white wax, slow flame.

Its light stretched across the table between two mugs of ginger tea and two hands that didn‚Äôt quite touch.

The tea had gone lukewarm.

Neither had noticed.

Joaquim leaned forward, elbows on the table.

His flight jacket hung on the chair behind him. 

He wore an old tank top and grey sweatpants, and his left knee bounced just slightly.

Dashiell sat with his hoodie sleeves pushed up, one hand around his mug, the other loose in his lap. 

His boots were off. 

His breathing had settled.

They were home.

And yet, they were stepping into something they‚Äôd never done before.

They were building the life they‚Äôd always talked around.

Tonight, they‚Äôd talk into it.

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù 
Dashiell asked again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting here, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but we don‚Äôt do things small.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. 
So let‚Äôs do this right.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo flinching.‚Äù

‚ÄúNone.‚Äù

Joaquim exhaled.

Leaned back slightly.

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs start with this:

What do we actually want to build?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a marriage,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut something that holds like one.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething chosen.‚Äù

Dashiell nodded.

‚ÄúI want home.
Something with windows that don‚Äôt break when things shake.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want presence,‚Äù 
Joaquim added.

‚ÄúNot performance. 
I‚Äôve spent too long trying to be enough for people who didn‚Äôt stay.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want us to be that.

I don‚Äôt want distance again.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs promise to never walk out in silence.‚Äù

They both nodded.

‚ÄúRule one,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúNo silent treatment. 
Ever.‚Äù

Joaquim smiled.

‚ÄúRule two: 
no pretending we‚Äôre fine when we‚Äôre bleeding inside.‚Äù

The candle danced.

The list began.

‚Ä¢ Weekly check-ins, even if nothing‚Äôs wrong.

‚Ä¢ Co-parenting values:
     discipline with dignity,          affirmation before advice.

‚Ä¢ No withholding affection, physical or emotional.

‚Ä¢ Sick days are sacred. 
     So is laughter.

‚Ä¢ Alone time is not abandonment.

‚Ä¢ Jealousy is not a weapon.

‚ÄúAnd one more,‚Äù 
Joaquim said.

Dashiell raised a brow.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf one of us falls in love...
With someone else.‚Äù

A pause.

A real one.

The air held its breath.

‚ÄúWe say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven if it hurts?‚Äù

‚ÄúEspecially then.‚Äù

Dashiell nodded, slowly.

‚ÄúBecause secrets corrode the floor we‚Äôre standing on.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

----

The tea had gone cold.

The candle was half-burned now, casting a softer light.

But neither of them moved.

They were too deep in it now.

Too committed to not leaving anything unsaid.

Dashiell sat back, shoulders slumped but open.

Joaquim traced a finger along the edge of the coaster, eyes focused, steady.

‚ÄúYou ever wonder,‚Äù 
Dashiell began slowly,

‚Äúif you‚Äôre choosing someone... because you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever find what you really want?‚Äù

Joaquim met his eyes.

‚ÄúYou mean like settling?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean like surviving.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôve done it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù

‚ÄúNico.‚Äù

Dashiell nodded.

The name didn‚Äôt sting anymore.

It just hung there, like a lesson.

‚ÄúI told myself he was what I wanted.

That the parts that didn‚Äôt fit were just me being difficult.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they weren‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt.‚Äù

Joaquim took a breath.

‚ÄúThe first time I felt peace in my body was in a tent.

With you beside me.

Not touching. 
Not kissing.

Just sleeping in the same silence.‚Äù

Dashiell swallowed.

His jaw clenched.

‚ÄúAnd I still said yes to someone else.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you thought love looked like duty.‚Äù

Dashiell looked away.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù


----

Dashiell stood at the sink, refilling the kettle.

Joaquim leaned in the doorway.

‚ÄúYou wanna hear my biggest fear?‚Äù 

Joaquim said.

‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat I‚Äôll spend my whole life being almost enough for everyone I love.

That I‚Äôll get thanked for showing up but never claimed.‚Äù

Dashiell turned, eyes burning.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been enough for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why was I never the choice?‚Äù

Silence.

Dashiell‚Äôs hand tightened around the kettle handle.

‚ÄúBecause I didn‚Äôt know how to say yes to something that didn‚Äôt ask me to change.‚Äù

The kettle hissed.

Dashiell poured hot water into their mugs.

Joaquim stirred his tea, the spoon clinking softly.

For a moment, neither of them spoke.

The sound of the spoon was enough.

The space between them wasn‚Äôt empty, it was listening.

‚ÄúYou ever think we were too soft?‚Äù 

Dashiell asked suddenly.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike we learned how to hold each other without ever gripping anything too tightly.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying we needed to fight?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm saying maybe we needed to risk more.‚Äù

Joaquim tilted his head.

‚ÄúYou kissed me in a room when we were with those two girls.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen proposed a life to me before you knew what you wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, damn-‚Äù

They both laughed.

But it didn‚Äôt break the moment.

It deepened it.

‚ÄúI think what scared me most,‚Äù Joaquim said, quieter now,

‚Äúwas that I‚Äôd always be the one who felt more.‚Äù

Dashiell‚Äôs face softened.

‚ÄúYou probably did.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it was worth it.‚Äù

‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã



FLASHBACK. FLIGHT SCHOOL LOUNGE.
YEAR PRIOR.

Joaquim sat alone, staring at his solo flight log.

The others laughed across the room, but his hands were shaking.

His fingers hovered over his phone.

A message unsent to Dashiell:

I did it. 
But it only felt real when I imagined telling you.

He never sent it.

But he carried it.

----

PRESENT  APARTMEN. BACK TO TABLE.


‚ÄúI used to wonder if maybe I was reading too much into things,‚Äù

Dashiell said.

‚ÄúLike maybe I was just broken and you were a safe place.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow I know you were home.

I just hadn‚Äôt learned how to unlock the door yet.‚Äù

Joaquim blinked hard.

Looked away for a second.

‚ÄúI think we have to name our fears before we start building anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs name them all.‚Äù

THE LIST OF FEARS

‚Ä¢ Fear of becoming invisible inside a relationship

‚Ä¢ Fear of wanting different things after the kids come

‚Ä¢ Fear of saying ‚Äúforever‚Äù and meaning ‚Äúuntil it‚Äôs hard‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Fear of messing up their friendship

‚Ä¢ Fear of never being enough

‚Ä¢ Fear of being too much

‚Ä¢ Fear of not making space for joy

Joaquim wrote them on a napkin.

Folded it.

Put it under the candle.

‚ÄúWe name them. 
We keep them.

We don‚Äôt pretend they disappear.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike fire exits,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use them. 
But you need to know where they are.‚Äù

They smiled.

And in that smile,

the ground beneath the table finally felt stable.


-----

The candle had nearly burned to the base.

The wax pooled like light that had gone soft with use.

The napkin with their fears sat between them, folded once, not hidden.

Dashiell leaned forward, arms on the table.

Joaquim sat straighter now, shoulders relaxed, eyes focused.

They were no longer naming ghosts.

They were building the house.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just agreeing to raise a kid,‚Äù 
Joaquim said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre agreeing to raise each other through it.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù 
Dashiell replied.

‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt do this halfway.‚Äù

‚ÄúFull circle or nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs start with what never breaks.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt walk out without explanation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe say what‚Äôs true, even when it‚Äôs uncomfortable.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe choose curiosity before judgment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe keep a Sabbath, not religious, but for us. 

No screens. 
No stress. 
Just us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt weaponize silence.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe sleep in the same space unless illness or safety says otherwise.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe raise children to be bold and gentle. 
Neither is optional.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe tell the truth. 
Especially when it scares us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe check in. 
Weekly. 
No exceptions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe build a family where no one has to earn their belonging.‚Äù

Dashiell took out his phone.

Opened the Notes app.

Started typing.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

Joaquim asked, smiling.

‚ÄúBecause this is our architecture.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou gonna email it to our kids?‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn right. 
Day one.

Welcome to the Donnachaidh-Barnes constitution.‚Äù

They laughed.

But there was reverence in it.

-----

The candle had burned low enough that the flame danced inside the bowl.

Soft flickers across their faces.

The night was deep now, no longer just dark, but sacred.

Joaquim leaned back in his chair.

‚ÄúOkay. 
Big stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

‚ÄúMoney?‚Äù

Dashiell nodded.

‚ÄúJoint account for the home.
Kids. 
Food.

Everything else? 

We talk before it becomes a shadow.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo hiding spending.

No secrets in the statements.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if one of us is struggling, emotionally, financially, we say it.
Early.‚Äù

They locked eyes.

This wasn‚Äôt romance.

It was covenant.

‚ÄúWhat about grief?‚Äù 
Joaquim asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve both lost people. 
But not each other. 
Not yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe name it when it shows up,‚Äù Dashiell said.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt armor up.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if one of us goes first,‚Äù
‚ÄúWe stay in the world.‚Äù

Joaquim‚Äôs throat caught.

‚ÄúPromise me that again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe stay in the world.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt touch.

But something breathed between them.

‚ÄúBoundaries?‚Äù 

Dashiell asked.

‚ÄúWe always get alone time.

One weekend a year, solo. 
No guilt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt bring old wounds into new fights.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt badmouth each other to the kids.
Or anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe let each other change.‚Äù

Dashiell‚Äôs voice cracked.

‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs scary.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

They sat with that.

Then:

‚ÄúBut if you change,‚Äù 
Joaquim said,
‚Äúand I stop knowing you,
I‚Äôll relearn.‚Äù

----


Midnight.


The candle had gone out.

The room smelled of warm wax and soft breath.

Joaquim sat with his hands folded, elbows on the table.

Dashiell leaned back in his chair, head tilted toward the ceiling.

The quiet wasn‚Äôt heavy.

It was full.

Like the silence after a symphony.

When the conductor‚Äôs hands are still lifted.

When no one in the room wants to break the spell.

‚ÄúYou realize what we just did, right?‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe got married.
With tea and a candle and no one watching.‚Äù

Joaquim smiled.

It was small.

But it reached every part of him.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt need applause.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe just needed the answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we gave it.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt stand.

They didn‚Äôt hug.

They just remained.

Like bricks after a foundation has set.

I chose not to go back for several reasons. Well, since then I've been trying to get a new job. 

I've applied to countless places, called and have only had like three interviews. Most places outright reject the application.

Well, last week I had an interview for this coffee place. It's a really cool coffee/florist place. And everything seemed like it went great. She said she'd call me this past Wednesday if I got the job. It's Saturday morning and I still haven't gotten a call. 

I get it, she interviewed other people, so one of them probably got it which is fine. But I was actually looking forward to getting this job and I actually thought I was gonna get it. She did say that a position might open up in November but I can't just wait till then. Everyone keeps bringing up me getting a job. Literally fucking everyone especially my grandma. I haven't been able to have one conversation with her where she doesn't bring up a job or school. 

I'm just so tired of all of this and it's stressing me out so badly. I've been depressed a lot lately and it's taking everything in me to just not end it. 

I'm tired of not having a job and I'm tired of not having any money. There's so much pressure coming from everyone that I just get angry whenever people bring up jobs because I'm so sick of talking about it. Even my fucking best friend brings it up if we talk. We don't talk on the phone often but when we do she asks and it's the same thing where I tell her nothing. And I get it, she just curious but then she always makes a comment about how ""you could always work at [her job]"" in the same condescending tone when I've told her multiple times that I can't because it's too far from my house. 

I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm so exhausted of thinking about getting a job and I still haven't figured out what to do about school because I ended up taking a gap year last year (not really on purpose, it was because I dropped out of cosmetology school) and I'm still not enrolled or applied to anywhere.",1,1753530430.0,AdviceForTeens,10,1.0,False

I tell myself that it‚Äôs going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven‚Äôt had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it yet, and that‚Äôs the most messed up part. I‚Äôm eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I‚Äôm a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven‚Äôt always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn‚Äôt until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

‚ÄúHoney! Are you coming down or not?‚Äù Once again, my mother‚Äôs voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, ‚ÄúGood morning, daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?‚Äù His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I‚Äôve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don‚Äôt complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

‚ÄúNo, daddy.‚Äù I don‚Äôt add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I‚Äôm a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I‚Äôm not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

‚ÄúThis is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,‚Äù Mom takes her place across from me, on my father‚Äôs other side, as she sips her black coffee, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.‚Äù

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, ‚ÄúBehave, Ethan!‚Äù

I‚Äôve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad‚Äôs chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it‚Äôs so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

‚ÄúOh! Before I forget,‚Äù Mom turns back to me, ‚ÄúI have a PTA meeting at Eli‚Äôs school this evening. I‚Äôll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, no problem.‚Äù My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. ‚ÄúWill you be home for supper, dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don‚Äôt make it in time.‚Äù I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it‚Äôs no surprise when he doesn‚Äôt make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, ‚ÄúThe train is leaving!‚Äù I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It‚Äôs the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she‚Äôs a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran‚Äôs song, Shivers, my sister‚Äôs favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can‚Äôt help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it‚Äôs times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I‚Äôm afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I‚Äôll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre going, nerd!‚Äù Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù She mimics and then shoves past me, ‚ÄúHow about you accidentally jump off a bridge?‚Äù Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school‚Äôs dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I‚Äôm going to have. Kaylee doesn‚Äôt even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season‚Äôs fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend‚Äôs party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That‚Äôs when it all started; it‚Äôs when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything‚Ä¶you name it‚Ä¶our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn‚Äôt remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn‚Äôt drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn‚Äôt drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn‚Äôt sat well with me, because it wasn‚Äôt like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn‚Äôt find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn‚Äôt heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn‚Äôt want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What‚Äôs one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace‚Äôs bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn‚Äôt until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out.

‚ÄúGet up, get up! We have to go!‚Äù she called out breathlessly, barely glancing in Alina‚Äôs direction as she rushed past.

Alina looked up from her book, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion. ‚ÄúMom, what‚Äôs going‚Äî‚Äù

Before she could finish, Helena was already yanking her off the couch, a whirlwind of energy and determination.

‚ÄúMom! What are you doing?!‚Äù Alina exclaimed, stumbling after her.

‚ÄúNo time for questions!‚Äù Helena shot back, practically pushing her toward the door.

Alina blinked as the sight of a gleaming black limousine parked in front of their house registered in her brain. She froze, pointing at it as if it might disappear if she stared long enough.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Alina said slowly. ‚ÄúWhat is that? And why does it look like something out of a soap opera?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust get in,‚Äù Helena huffed, throwing the car door open.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alina said, crossing her arms. ‚ÄúNot until you tell me what‚Äôs going on. And if you say anything ridiculous, I‚Äôm locking myself in my room.‚Äù

Helena sighed, glancing at her watch. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this, baby. I‚Äôm getting married. Tonight.‚Äù

Alina blinked again. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting what?‚Äù

‚ÄúMarried,‚Äù Helena repeated, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. ‚Äúto the love of my life‚Äù

‚ÄúThe love of your‚Äî‚Äù Alina‚Äôs mouth fell open, her heart sinking. Not again. Not another one of her mother‚Äôs ridiculous, spontaneous marriages. ‚ÄúMom, really? Another one?You are not doing this to me again. Who is it this time?‚Äù

Some long-lost pen pal? The mailman? Did you fall in love with the guy who fixed our plumbing last week?‚Äù

Helena waved a hand dismissively. ‚ÄúHis name is Charles. He‚Äôs perfect, Alina. And this time, I‚Äôm sure‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always sure!‚Äù Alina snapped, ‚ÄúEvery single time, you swear this guy is your soulmate, and it‚Äôs always a disaster!‚Äù

‚ÄúShhh! This time it‚Äôs different,‚Äù Helena insisted.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs exactly what you said the last time! And the time before that! Mom, I‚Äôm done. Count me out of this one. Seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlina, stop being dramatic.‚Äù

‚ÄúDramatic?‚Äù Alina threw her arms up. ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre getting married tonight! And you didn‚Äôt think to tell me until now?‚Äù

Helena‚Äôs face softened. ‚Äú We just made the decision a few hours ago, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, not okay!‚Äù Alina echoed, her voice rising. ‚ÄúMom, this isn‚Äôt some spur-of-the-moment lunch date! It‚Äôs a wedding! With vows and rings and‚Äîoh, I don‚Äôt know‚Äîa whole new family for me to awkwardly navigate!‚Äù

Helena stepped closer, her expression pleading. ‚ÄúBaby, I need you to trust me. Charles is...he‚Äôs different.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always different,‚Äù Alina shot back. ‚ÄúAnd it always ends the same way: awkward family dinners, forced smiles, and me trying to figure out who‚Äôs allergic to what!‚Äù

‚ÄúAlina.‚Äù Helena‚Äôs voice softened, and for a moment, Alina saw the vulnerability beneath her mother‚Äôs impulsiveness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all I have. Please. Just come with me.‚Äù

Alina sighed heavily, her resistance crumbling. ‚ÄúFine. But I swear, if this guy turns out to be a total disaster, I‚Äôm changing my number and moving to where you will never find me again‚Äù

Helena grinned triumphantly and practically shoved Alina into the limo. ‚ÄúThank you! Now, no more complaining‚Äîwe‚Äôre on a tight schedule!‚Äù

\---

At the Boutique.

‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe this,‚Äù Alina muttered, tugging at the impossibly tight dress her mother had picked out. ‚ÄúYou meet a guy, fall head over heels in two weeks, and now we‚Äôre here. This has got to be some kind of record. ‚Äú

Helena, adjusting her own dress, smiled dreamily. ‚ÄúWhen you know, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mom. When you know, you take a breath, maybe think about it for more than five minutes, and then you know.‚Äù Alina glared at her reflection, trying to yank the dress into something resembling comfort. ‚ÄúSeriously, how do you keep finding these people? Is there a secret club for hopeless romantics, or did you just get lucky with another guy who can‚Äôt resist your charm?‚Äù

Helena chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too cynical, sweetheart.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not cynical. I‚Äôm realistic.‚Äù Alina gestured to the mirror. ‚ÄúAnd realistically, this dress is cutting off my oxygen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look beautiful,‚Äù Helena said, her voice tinged with pride.

‚ÄúI look like a stuffed sausage,‚Äù Alina deadpanned. ‚ÄúWhich, by the way, is not the aesthetic I was going for.‚Äù

Helena ignored her, checking her watch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre late. Come on.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mom, seriously‚Äîthis thing is so tight I might need the jaws of life to get out of it!‚Äù

Helena rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll manage. Now move.‚Äù

\---

The limo rolled up to an elegant estate that looked like something out of a fairy tale.

Alina stepped out, wobbling in her heels as she took in the sprawling gardens, twinkling lights, and the small, intimate group of guests scattered around.

‚ÄúThis is...a lot,‚Äù she muttered, tugging at her dress as she followed her mother toward the altar.

Helena didn‚Äôt respond, too focused on the man waiting at the front‚Äîthe groom.

‚ÄúThat's him‚Äù She said smiling so dreamy

‚ÄúHe's an Alpha, thought you didn't like Alphas anymore ‚Äú¬†

‚ÄúJust because James was a dick doesn't mean they all are. Charles is an angel‚Äù

Alina rolls her eyes

‚ÄúMet this guy two weeks ago, and now you‚Äôre marrying him? This is a new low, even for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúCharles is Wonderful, he'll be a great dad to you, You‚Äôll love him.‚Äù

Alina snorted. ‚ÄúEw. Don‚Äôt say that. He‚Äôs not my dad.‚Äù

Helena rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúStop being so dramatic. Just smile and be polite, okay? This is a big day.‚Äù

‚ÄúPolite? I‚Äôm about to pass out in this stupid dress, and you want polite?‚Äù Alina yanked at the fabric, her frustration building.

‚ÄúStop fussing,‚Äù

Alina watched as her mother practically floated down the aisle, her face glowing with happiness. She sighed inwardly. She loved her mom, truly. But this was the fourth time in as many years that she‚Äôd stood by and watched Helena throw herself headfirst into a whirlwind romance.

After the vows were exchanged, Alina tried to make herself as invincible as possible at the reception. She didn‚Äôt want to meet her new stepfather. She didn‚Äôt want to hear the gushy love stories. She just wanted to go home, kick off her heels, and pretend this whole night hadn‚Äôt happened.

Unfortunately, Helena had other plans.

‚ÄúAlina, come meet Charles Grayson,‚Äù she said, dragging her over to a tall, distinguished-looking man who smiled warmly at her.

‚ÄúAlina, it‚Äôs wonderful to meet you,‚Äù Charles said, his voice deep and pleasant.

Alina forced a smile. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry my son couldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù Charles said apologetically. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll meet him tomorrow at dinner. I‚Äôve planned something special for the family.‚Äù

Great, Alina thought. Another stranger to deal with.

But as she shook Charles‚Äôs hand, a strange, fleeting sensation prickled at the edge of her senses. Her wolf stirred uneasily, though she couldn‚Äôt pinpoint why.

Brushing off the feeling, Alina forced herself to smile. ‚ÄúLooking forward to it,‚Äù she lied.

She plastered on a smile that looks like her lip was bending to the left

She wasn‚Äôt stupid‚Äîshe knows who the Graysons are. They practically owned the entire country.

What has her mother gotten them into this time.

# Unexpected

Alina crossed her arms, leaning back on the faded couch as she stared at her mother, Helena, who was pacing the room with determination. Her hands were full of bags, the contents tumbling out slightly from her careless packing.¬†

Helena's energy fills the small living room like an impending storm.

""Mom, I‚Äôm not moving into some rich mansion,"" Alina said flatly, her tone laced with defiance.

Helena whirled to face her, her lips curving into an exasperated frown. ""I‚Äôm not letting you stay here alone.""

""I‚Äôm not a child, Mom!"" Alina protested, sitting upright.

""You‚Äôre my child!""

Alina groaned, throwing her hands up. ""Look, first of all, I‚Äôm an adult. I can take care of myself. Secondly, I‚Äôm not a kid you can just drag around to live with your new husband.""

""Your new father. Your new family,"" Helena corrected with a teasing smile.

Alina cringed, her face contorting in disgust. ""Ew, stop calling him that.""

""Alina!"" Helena‚Äôs voice rose sharply, but there was no masking her excitement.

Alina crossed her arms again. ""Didn‚Äôt you say his son hates you? What kind of family could that possibly be?""

""He‚Äôll come around, and we are not talking about him,"" Helena said, dismissively waving her hand as if brushing away the thought of her new stepson.

""We should talk about him,"" Alina insisted, her brow furrowing. ""He didn‚Äôt even come to his father‚Äôs wedding, and now there‚Äôs this family dinner where he‚Äôs suddenly going to show up? Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.""

""I told you, it‚Äôs nothing serious. Stop trying to change the subject.""

""Okay,"" Alina said, leaning forward with a sarcastic grin. ""Let‚Äôs say your marriage crashes‚Äî""

""Why would you even say that?"" Helena gasped, clutching her chest dramatically.

""Because it always does, Mom,"" Alina shot back without hesitation.

""This time it‚Äôs different,"" Helena said firmly. ""I love this man. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever truly been in love.""

Alina rolled her eyes. ""Mom, you‚Äôve said that exact same line with every single husband.""

Helena‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt falter. ""I‚Äôm serious this time. Charles is the one. My soulmate. My Alpha‚Äî""

Alina snorted, the disbelief clear on her face. ""Sure, Mom. Whatever you say.""

Helena crossed the room and perched on the armrest of Alina‚Äôs chair. Her tone softened as she said, ""Besides, things are going to be different for us now. He‚Äôs already got you a job at his company. You start next week.""

Alina‚Äôs mouth fell open in shock. ""No way! What?!""

Helena smirked. ""Close your mouth, darling. You‚Äôll catch flies.""

""You‚Äôre telling me I have a job at Grayson Enterprises?"" Alina‚Äôs voice rose in disbelief. She had been hunting for months, desperate to land something decent, and now this?

Helena grinned triumphantly. ""Yes. Your momma works fast.""

""Mom‚Äî""

""I need you there too, baby,"" Helena interrupted, her expression softening. ""I can‚Äôt leave you here all by yourself while I‚Äôm staying at Charles‚Äôs house. I don‚Äôt care how old you are; you‚Äôre still my child, and I‚Äôm taking you with me.""

Alina sighed, rubbing her temples. ""Mom""

‚ÄúLet's go shop for what to wear to dinner first then-""

‚ÄúShopping? With what money?‚Äù

Her mother brought out a card smiling. ‚ÄúSay hello to one of my wedding gifts, your momma is rich now baby, get used to it, peasant!‚Äù

Alina rolls her eyes, totally done with her mother.

\---

Later that evening, Alina found herself sitting stiffly at an extravagant table in one of the most exclusive restaurants she had ever seen. The setting was glamorous‚Äîsoft golden lighting, sparkling crystal glasses, and a sense of luxury that felt worlds apart from her reality.

She tried to focus on her wine glass as her mother and Charles exchanged loving glances, oblivious to her discomfort. It was nauseating, really.

Charles broke the silence with a warm smile. ""He'll be here any moment, I'm sorry for his lateness""

Alina‚Äôs grip on her wine glass tightened. The infamous son who supposedly hates her mother.¬†

He's probably going to hate me too.

¬†Wonderful!

Her mother‚Äôs voice cut through her thoughts. ""I'm sure he'll get along with Alina in no time especially since they'll be working together ""

She picked up her wine glass just as the world shifted beneath her.

In the world of werewolves, mating is sacred. The chance of meeting your true mate is incredibly rare.

Most people had adapted to the idea that they might never find theirs. They learned to settle, to form bonds with someone they loved or felt comfortable with.¬†

These bonds weren‚Äôt as intense as the ones shared by true mates, but they worked, allowing for happiness and companionship.

But meeting your true mate? It was undeniable‚Äîlike knowing your own name.

All werewolves carried a similar scent, indistinguishable to others. Until you meet your mate. Their scent would pierce through the ordinary, freezing you to your very core. Their touch would ignite something deep within, electrifying your very soul. When it happened, there was no confusing it.

Alina didn‚Äôt need anyone to explain what was happening now.

The sharp scent of rain mixed with something sweet hit her like a storm, rooting her in place. Her body froze as her gaze snapped to the entrance of the restaurant. The world around her blurred, fading into irrelevance.

And then, he stepped inside.

The scent overwhelmed her, stirring something primal. She wanted to let her wolf loose, to mark and claim him as hers. Her Alpha. Her mate.

His eyes found hers instantly, locking on as if drawn by the same invisible force.

‚ÄúOh, Kyle is here,‚Äù someone said casually, but it barely registered.

The glass slipped from her hand, shattering as it hit the floor.

# Brutal Decision

It didn‚Äôt take long for Helena, Charles, or even the people in the restaurant to understand what had just happened.

Two true mates had found each other.

Alina and Kyle stood frozen, their eyes locked across the room. To most onlookers, it was something beautiful‚Äîa rare and sacred moment when two souls connected by fate finally found each other.

But to Helena, it was horrifying.

She gasped, her hand flying to her mouth, tears welling up in her eyes. ‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling with fear and disbelief.

\---

The drive back to Charles‚Äô mansion was silent, the air thick with tension and confusion.

Once they arrived, Alina was taken to a room with her mother, while Kyle was led to another with his father.

Alina sat on the floor, her back pressed against the wall, tears streaming down her face. Her chest felt heavy, like she could barely breathe under the weight of everything that had happened.

‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù she choked out, her voice breaking.

Helena sat on the bed, tears of her own slipping silently down her cheeks. She shook her head, her voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, baby. It‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù

Hearing the pain in her mother‚Äôs voice shattered Alina even more.

The events at the restaurant replayed over and over in her mind, each moment leaving her raw. She had found her mate.

Her mate.

And her mate was her new stepbrother.

Her mother‚Äôs new husband‚Äôs son.

A fresh wave of sobs racked her body as she buried her face in her hands.

‚ÄúStop it, child. Stop it,‚Äù her mother said, though her voice was weak and unconvincing, trembling as she fought back her own tears.

What was she supposed to do?

She couldn‚Äôt destroy her mother‚Äôs new marriage.¬†

But Kyle was her mate. The one chosen for her by the goddess herself.

Her mate.

Helena got up from the bed and knelt beside her daughter, pulling her into a hug. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out. I promise. Just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt cry anymore,‚Äù she whispered, though the pain in her voice betrayed her.

Alina leaned into her mother, clutching her tightly. She didn‚Äôt know how to fix this. She didn‚Äôt even know if it could be fixed.

\---

Meanwhile, in another room, Kyle sat on the edge of a leather chair, his arms crossed, frustration etched into his features.

Charles paced the room, his face pale and his hands shaking slightly. ‚ÄúKyle, this is serious. She‚Äôs your mate.‚Äù

Kyle scoffed, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt care?‚Äù Charles stopped pacing and turned to his son. ‚ÄúDo you understand what a mate bond is? This isn‚Äôt just some random connection‚Äîit‚Äôs sacred. It‚Äôs fate.‚Äù

Kyle rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúFate? Are you serious, Father? I‚Äôm supposed to drop everything in my life‚Äîeverything I‚Äôve worked for‚Äîand dive into this just because of some bond I didn‚Äôt choose?‚Äù

Charles‚Äô jaw tightened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just ‚Äòsome bond,‚Äô son. It‚Äôs the mate bond. It‚Äôs the strongest connection a werewolf can have.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, I don‚Äôt care! I‚Äôve never been a fan of this whole ‚Äòmate‚Äô thing. Nobody‚Äînot even the goddess‚Äîgets to choose who I spend my life with. That‚Äôs my decision.‚Äù

Charles tried to calm him, his voice soft but firm. ‚ÄúKyle-‚Äù

‚ÄúFather, I have a girlfriend. Someone I‚Äôve known for years. Someone I love. I'm planning to propose to her soon. What am I supposed to do‚Äîthrow her aside because of some magical bond?‚Äù

Charles sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúSon, this isn‚Äôt about throwing anyone aside. This is about‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease stop!‚Äù Kyle interrupted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ending your marriage over this nonsense, Father. But I‚Äôll tell you what I will do. I‚Äôll go to her, and we‚Äôll reject each other. End of story.‚Äù

Charles froze, staring at his son in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat? Are you nuts!‚Äù

Kyle‚Äôs voice was cold and resolute. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll reject her. We‚Äôll both reject the bond, and everyone can move on with their lives. I'm sure she won‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

Nah this was going too far for Charles.

‚ÄúLook, let's just cool off, think about-‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing to think about, let's end it today, now‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just reject her. She‚Äôs your true mate, Kyle, don't do something you'll regret-.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can and I will,‚Äù Kyle said firmly. I don't think I'll be regretting anything father. Let‚Äôs just get this over with.‚Äù

‚ÄúKyle‚Äî‚Äù Charles didn't know how to convince his¬†son. He was heading towards a disaster with this, he could see it.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, father‚Ä¶‚Äù

# Mutual Rejection?

‚ÄúI think it's best if we reject the bond.‚Äù

Alina felt her entire world crumble around her.

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù her mother cried, rushing forward, tears still streaming down her face.

All Alina could do was stare at the man in front of her. Her Alpha. Her mate. Not only was he proposing rejection, but he didn‚Äôt look like he cared. Not one bit. His expression was cold, detached. It was like this bond between them was nothing but a burden he couldn‚Äôt wait to get rid of.

‚ÄúI have a conference meeting in an hour,‚Äù Kyle said, his tone clipped and impatient. ‚ÄúCan we get this over with?‚Äù

Alina‚Äôs heart shattered even more. His words were sharp, uncaring, cutting deep into her already bleeding soul. To him, this bond didn‚Äôt mean anything. He didn‚Äôt care about her.

‚ÄúPlease, just stop! Please, let‚Äôs just stop‚Äî‚Äù her mother‚Äôs voice broke as she begged, but Alina cut her off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said quietly, her eyes never leaving Kyle. Her voice sounded foreign to her, empty.

‚ÄúBaby, what are you‚Äî‚Äù Her mother looked horrified, desperate to stop what was happening.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Mom.‚Äù Her tone was lifeless, her gaze still locked on her so-called mate. The one who was supposed to love her. Protect her. Cherish her. Instead, he was ready to throw her away like she meant nothing.

‚ÄúAre you out of your mind? Charles, do something, please!‚Äù her mother pleaded, turning to Kyle‚Äôs father for help.

Charles stepped forward, trying to intervene. ‚ÄúListen‚Äî‚Äù

But the tension in the room was suffocating, so thick that even their parents' desperate attempts to stop them couldn‚Äôt break through it.

Kyle‚Äôs cold eyes met hers. His expression was unreadable, but his voice was firm when he asked, ‚ÄúYour name?‚Äù

She swallowed hard, fighting back the tears threatening to spill. ‚ÄúAlina Morgan,‚Äù she said softly, her heart dropping further with every second.

This was really happening.

The air around them stilled, as if even the world was holding its breath.

Alina watched him, her chest tight, her breaths shallow. Every part of her screamed for him to stop, to change his mind. But deep down, she knew he wouldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI, Kyle Grayson‚Äî‚Äù He paused for a moment, and for the briefest second, Alina thought she saw something flicker in his eyes. Was it hesitation? Regret? Or was it nothing at all? Maybe she was just imagining it. Maybe she was just desperate for her mate to feel something.

‚Äú‚Äîreject you, Alina Morgan, and our bond to the moon.‚Äù

It felt like the world collapsed beneath her feet.

Pain like she had never known stabbed through her chest, piercing every part of her. Her wolf howled inside her, the sound echoing in her mind, raw and agonizing. Tears spilled down her cheeks, unbidden, unstoppable.

‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù her mother screamed, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúPlease, stop! I said stop‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúKyle!‚Äù Charles tried again, his voice firm but tinged with desperation.

But Kyle didn‚Äôt look at them. His focus was entirely on Alina, as if he were waiting, waiting for her to say the words that would seal their rejection.

Alina‚Äôs knees threatened to give out, her body trembling as she tried to process the unbearable pain coursing through her. The mate bond, the one thing every werewolf longed for, was being torn apart before it even had a chance.

She opened her mouth to speak, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Her throat felt tight, her voice trapped by the sheer weight of her heartbreak.

Still, she forced herself to speak. She had to. There was no other choice.

‚ÄúI, Alina Morgan,‚Äù her voice broke, trembling with every syllable, ‚Äúaccept your rejection, Kyle Grayson.‚Äù

The moment the words left her lips, the pain intensified. It was like a blade twisting inside her chest, ripping apart every connection her wolf had to her mate.

Her wolf let out one final, mournful howl before retreating deep within her.

She feels herself falling, the world turning dark. The last thing she hears is her mother‚Äôs panicked voice screaming her name.

Then nothing¬†

Darkness‚Ä¶.

# A New Mess

Alina looked around anxiously as she stepped into the airport, her eyes scanning the crowd for her mom. The familiar chaos of arrivals, the hum of chatter, and the rolling of suitcases on tiled floors barely registered as her focus remained singular. The past month had been a blur, one she desperately needed, but now she was home, ready to face what she had left behind.

Yes, Alina had left the country. The rejection had been unbearable. She had woken up in the hospital after her mate, Kyle Grayson, rejected her. The pain had been too much to bear, and her wolf had suffered even more. It felt like every part of her had shattered.

One of the doctors at the hospital had gently suggested she take a vacation, a break from everything, to give her wolf the space and time to accept the rejection fully. The idea had sounded absurd at first, but eventually, she realized it was her only option to heal.

Charles Grayson, her stepfather, had immediately stepped in to cover all the expenses, insisting she take as much time as she needed. And so, Alina had left, staying away for more than a month.

Now, standing at the airport, she felt a mix of emotions. She was ready to move on‚Äîor at least she hoped she was.

Her mother‚Äôs scream of delight snapped her out of her thoughts. ""Alina!""

Before Alina could react, her mother enveloped her in a tight hug, tears streaming down her face. ""Oh, baby, I missed you so much!""

Alina hugged her back just as tightly, her own tears threatening to fall. ""Missed you too, Mom,"" she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

Charles stood nearby, watching with a kind smile. Her mother had been right‚ÄîCharles was a good man. He had been nothing but supportive throughout everything. Alina greeted him warmly, smiling up at him.

""Welcome home, Alina,"" Charles said, his tone genuine.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she replied softly.

For the first time in weeks, a part of her felt at peace. Maybe, in some strange way, the rejection had been a blessing in disguise. At least now, her mother could have the happiness she truly deserved.

\---

Later, Alina sat cross-legged on the bed in the room assigned to her in the Grayson mansion. Yes, she had finally agreed to move in. It had taken some convincing, but in the end, she realized it was the best way forward for her family.

Her legs rested on her mother‚Äôs lap as they sat together, talking quietly. Her fingers absentmindedly played with the hem of her sweater as her mother gently ran a hand through her hair.

‚ÄúAre you sure about the job, baby?‚Äù her mother asked, her voice laced with worry.

‚ÄúMom, I told you, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Alina replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get the urge to‚Ä¶ jump my stepbrother anymore. The bond is dead and broken. We‚Äôre siblings now. It‚Äôs best we start getting along.‚Äù

Her mother didn‚Äôt look convinced. ‚ÄúAre you sure, baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúPositive,‚Äù Alina lied. She forced a small smile, trying to reassure her mother. ‚ÄúBesides, it‚Äôs my fault for losing the other position. A company like that wasn‚Äôt going to keep the role vacant forever, waiting for me.‚Äù She sighed, the weight of her words settling heavily on her shoulders.

Charles had reassured her that another position would open soon, and she would be first in line for it. But for now, the only available role was as Kyle‚Äôs personal assistant. His previous assistant was going on maternity leave, and the position was temporary‚Äîjust a few months.

Alina had frozen when her mother first told her about it a week ago. The thought of working so closely with Kyle made her stomach churn. But how long could she keep avoiding him? Their parents were happily married, and she knew they all needed to learn to coexist.

‚ÄúWhen do I start?‚Äù Alina asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil in her chest.

‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äîor whenever you‚Äôre ready,‚Äù her mother replied cautiously.

‚ÄúTomorrow is fine,‚Äù Alina said, nodding.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù her mother asked again, her concern evident in her eyes.

‚ÄúPositive,‚Äù Alina said firmly.

But she lied.

# Thrown in Together

Kyle sat behind his polished desk, trying to focus on the report in front of him, but his mind kept drifting. Alina was starting today. His father had informed him a week ago, and Kyle‚Äôs initial response had been a resounding ‚Äúno.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need a personal assistant, Kyle,‚Äù his father had insisted. ‚ÄúAlina‚Äôs qualified, and she‚Äôs willing. You‚Äôve been rejecting every candidate.‚Äù

Kyle hadn‚Äôt been able to argue. If Alina had agreed to the position, why should he have a problem with it? She seemed determined to move forward, so why couldn‚Äôt he?

Still, he couldn‚Äôt shake the unease that had settled in his chest since learning the news. He had rejected her, and the aftermath had been‚Ä¶ messy. Kyle could lie to everyone else, but not to himself. The guilt of how the rejection had affected her bites at him sometimes.

He also couldn‚Äôt ignore another truth: sometimes, he missed her. It was irrational, frustrating, and confusing. How could he miss someone he didn‚Äôt truly know?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù he muttered to himself, shaking his head. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

When his intercom buzzed, his secretary‚Äôs voice cut through his thoughts. ‚ÄúMr. Grayson, Alina is here.‚Äù

Kyle‚Äôs heart nearly leaped out of his chest. His pulse raced, and he felt an uncharacteristic wave of nervousness wash over him.¬†

Kyle doesn't get nervous, he doesn't do nervous, what the fuck?

He straightened his tie, ran a hand through his hair, and took a deep breath to compose himself.

‚ÄúSend her in,‚Äù he said, his voice calm and clipped, betraying none of the chaos within.

The door opened, and the moment his eyes landed on Alina, his heart slammed against his ribcage.

She stepped into the office with a quiet confidence, her posture straight, her chin held high. She looked stunning‚Äîmore radiant than he remembered. Her sleek hair framed her face perfectly, her eyes sparkling with a determined light.

Kyle‚Äôs head spun, and his composure wavered for just a second. What the hell is wrong with me? he thought, forcing himself to maintain a stoic expression.

‚ÄúGood morning Sir‚Äù Alina said politely, her voice calm and professional.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he replied, his tone neutral as he rose to his feet.

They exchanged pleasantries, but Kyle could barely focus on her words. All he could notice was how gorgeous she looked and how her eyes seemed to shine even brighter now. His gaze involuntarily dropped to her lips before he caught himself.

He clenched his jaw and shook his head slightly, forcing his thoughts back on track.

‚ÄúMrs. Danie will teach you everything you need to know over the next few days,‚Äù he said, gesturing to his secretary.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best, sir,‚Äù Alina replied with a small, confident smile.

‚ÄúMr. Grayson will do,‚Äù he corrected her quickly.

His eyes lingered on her for a fraction too long before he cleared his throat. The air-conditioned room felt stifling, and he realized, to his embarrassment, that he was sweating under his perfectly tailored suit.

‚ÄúYou can leave now,‚Äù he said abruptly, his voice firmer than he intended.

Alina nodded, her expression neutral as she turned and left the office, following Mrs. Danie.

The moment the door closed, Kyle sank back into his chair, his head falling into his hands.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck just happened?‚Äù he muttered under his breath.

Did he really just fucking feel like kissing the life out of his step sister?... The mate he rejected?

He must be insane!

# Second thoughts

Mrs. Daine walked Alina through the large office building, her heels clicking on the polished floors as they moved from department to department.¬†

Each introduction was the same‚Ä¶A polite smile from Alina, a quick nod from the employees, and then they moved on.

‚ÄúThis is Marketing,‚Äù Mrs. Daine said, gesturing toward a cluster of sleek desks occupied by people in sharp suits. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll likely coordinate with them for campaign approvals. They‚Äôre efficient, but deadlines are non-negotiable here.‚Äù

Alina nodded, pasting on a smile that barely reached her eyes. ‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd here‚Äôs Finance,‚Äù Mrs. Daine continued as they stepped into another brightly lit floor. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre responsible for budgets, payroll, and keeping Mr. Grayson‚Äôs projects on track. You‚Äôll be working with them quite a bit.‚Äù

Alina tried to focus, taking in every detail Mrs. Daine shared, but her mind kept drifting.¬†

Can she really do this?

She was really going to be Kyle Grayson‚Äôs personal assistant? She wanted to believe it was a decision she made out of practicality but‚Ä¶

\_\_\_\_

By the end of the week, Alina had managed to settle into her new role. She memorized schedules, familiarized herself with the company‚Äôs workflow, and avoided Kyle as much as she could.

Even though that was impossible since she was literally working directly under him.

Alina tries to stay positive¬†

She reminded herself every morning: He isn‚Äôt your mate. You rejected each other. You‚Äôre just step-siblings now.

But it didn‚Äôt feel that way.

There were moments when she caught herself staring too long or when his scent lingered in the air longer than it should. She hated how her body betrayed her, how her wolf stirred even at the smallest hint of his presence.

She told herself it would pass. She just needed more time.

\_\_\_

On Friday, just as the office began winding down for the weekend, Mrs Daine approached Alina‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúMr. Grayson has requested for our presence in his office.‚Äù

Alina‚Äôs stomach twisted. She grabbed her notebook, smoothing out her skirt before making her way to his office. Mrs. Daine joined her in the hallway, giving her an encouraging smile.

Inside, Kyle sat behind his imposing desk, his expression unreadable. The floor-to-ceiling windows behind him showcased a breathtaking view of the city, but Alina barely noticed. Her focus was on him, on the way he leaned back in his chair, exuding an air of authority.

‚ÄúTake a seat,‚Äù Kyle said, gesturing to the chairs in front of him.

Alina lowered herself into the seat beside Mrs. Daine, her back straight, her hands folded neatly in her lap. She refused to let him see how nervous she was.

‚ÄúSo, Mrs. Daine,‚Äù Kyle began, his deep voice filling the room, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your assessment of Miss Morgan?‚Äù

Mrs. Daine glanced at Alina before answering. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs done exceptionally well. Quick learner, organized, and professional. She‚Äôll do great in this role.‚Äù

Alina smiled politely, grateful for the praise but uneasy under Kyle‚Äôs steady gaze.

Kyle‚Äôs eyes flicked to her for a brief moment before returning to Mrs. Daine. ‚ÄúSo, she‚Äôs ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe is,‚Äù Mrs. Daine affirmed.

Kyle‚Äôs attention shifted back to Alina. His expression was cold, detached, as if she were just another employee and not the woman he was destined to be with by the moon.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Kyle said, turning back to Mrs. Daine. ‚ÄúYour leave begins today. If you finalize your decision to relocate, please inform the company a month in advance. I wish you the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Grayson,‚Äù Mrs. Daine said, standing.

Kyle‚Äôs gaze lingered on Alina as Mrs. Daine left the room. The door clicked shut, leaving them alone.

Alina‚Äôs pulse quickened. She braced herself for‚Ä¶ something. A comment, a question, anything. But Kyle simply flipped through the files on his desk, his expression unreadable.

Finally, he spoke, his tone dismissive. ‚ÄúSee you on Monday, Miss Morgan.‚Äù

Alina froze, the formality of his words cutting through her like a blade. She nodded stiffly, standing and leaving without a word.

The second she was out of his office, she exhaled shakily. Her chest felt heavy, her wolf restless. She leaned against the wall for support, closing her eyes and letting the emptiness of the hallway swallow¬†her.

Can she really do this?

This is really looking like a bad idea.

# Ready To Start

The sun shone brightly as Alina and her mother, Helena, exited the house and headed toward the mall. Helena had insisted they spend the day shopping, claiming Alina needed a new wardrobe for her job. Alina hadn‚Äôt argued.¬†

In the end she didn‚Äôt have the energy to resist her mother‚Äôs determination.

As they walked into the bustling shopping center, Helena was already pointing out stores. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll start here. You need blouses, skirts, slacks, maybe even a few dresses. And shoes, definitely shoes.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù Alina groaned, trailing behind her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a full closet change‚Äù

‚ÄúNonsense! You‚Äôre working as a secretary now. You need to look sharp, professional, and confident.‚Äù Helena paused, glancing over her shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt roll your eyes at me. I saw that.‚Äù

Alina bit back a laugh, shaking her head as her mother marched into the first store.

\_\_\_

The day was filled with Alina trying on clothes, swapping sizes, and Helena snapping photos of Alina in each outfit. They moved from store to store, their arms gradually filling with bags of new office attire.

‚ÄúI think this is enough,‚Äù Alina said as they exited the fifth store.

‚ÄúEnough? We‚Äôre just getting started!‚Äù Helena declared, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm not running a fashion show.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve fooled me with how gorgeous you look in that last dress,‚Äù Helena teased, bumping Alina‚Äôs shoulder.

By the time they finished shopping, Alina was exhausted. She flopped into the nearest chair at a small little restaurant while Helena ordered them drinks and snacks.

As they sipped their beverages, Helena couldn‚Äôt stop herself from watching Alina closely. It had been a few tough months for her daughter. The rejection, the hospital stay, the vacation, the move‚Ä¶ It was a lot for anyone to handle, and yet, here Alina was, putting on a brave face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you to stop looking at me like that. I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Alina said suddenly, breaking Helena‚Äôs train of thought.

Helena feigned innocence. ‚ÄúNow I can‚Äôt look at you anymore?‚Äù

Alina sighed, shaking her head as she took another sip of her drink. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I know what you‚Äôre thinking, and you don‚Äôt need to worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it. I just feel like it‚Äôll be hard working beside him,‚Äù Helena said, her voice gentle but concerned.

Alina rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúWe rejected each other. There‚Äôs no bond anymore. And like I‚Äôve said a million times already, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù

Helena studied her daughter for a few seconds, her expression softening. Finally, she nodded. ‚ÄúOkay, fine. If you say so.‚Äù

The moment was interrupted by someone clearing their throat nearby. Alina glanced up, her heart skipping a beat as recognition hit her. Standing in front of their table was Paul, one of her mother‚Äôs ex-husbands.

‚ÄúHelena,‚Äù Paul said, his tone warm but surprised.

‚ÄúPaul,‚Äù Helena replied, standing to greet him.

The two exchanged polite smiles, and Alina couldn‚Äôt help but notice the slight blush on her mother‚Äôs cheeks.

‚ÄúYou look so good,‚Äù Paul said, his gaze lingering on Helena.

Helena‚Äôs smile grew wider. ‚ÄúOh, thank you. You‚Äôre looking well yourself.‚Äù

Paul‚Äôs attention shifted to Alina, his smile widening. ‚ÄúLook at you, Alina. You‚Äôre so grown now.‚Äù

Alina nodded politely, unsure how to respond. She barely remembered Paul, her mother had been married to him for only four months, and they hadn‚Äôt exactly bonded.

‚ÄúGood to see you, Mr. Paul,‚Äù she said, managing a small smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you both,‚Äù Paul replied. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he handed Helena his phone.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs exchange numbers. It‚Äôs been too long.‚Äù

Helena hesitated for a moment before typing her number into his phone. They chatted for a few more minutes before Paul excused himself and left their table.

Alina turned to her mother, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhy did you exchange numbers with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Helena asked, playing dumb.

‚ÄúI said, why did you exchange numbers with him? I remember you deleting his number after you broke up,‚Äù Alina said, crossing her arms.

Helena shrugged, brushing off the question. ‚ÄúBecause I was hurt back then. I‚Äôm over it now. We don‚Äôt have to be enemies, you know. It‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

Alina gave her mother a skeptical look but decided not to press further. She returned to her drink, mulling over the odd interaction.

After a few moments of silence, Helena spoke again. ‚ÄúReady for work on Monday?‚Äù

The first word that popped into Alina‚Äôs head was no, but instead, she forced a smile and said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Helena studied her daughter for a moment, her eyes filled with motherly concern. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

Alina nodded. ‚ÄúPositive.‚Äù

But as she sipped her drink, her mind raced with uncertainty. She wasn‚Äôt ready‚Äîfar from it. But she didn‚Äôt have a choice.

# Monday Relief

Alina woke up to the sound of her alarm blaring at six in the morning. She groaned, her body reluctant to cooperate as she reached to turn it off. Today was the day‚Äîthe first day of her new job. The thought made her so freaking nervous.

Her mother, Helena, had already been up for an hour, bustling around the kitchen. As Alina got ready, Helena poked her head into her room.

‚ÄúAre you sure about that blouse? Maybe something darker would look more professional,‚Äù her mom said, eyeing her with a critical but loving gaze.

‚ÄúMom, this is fine,‚Äù Alina replied, smoothing the hem of her light-blue shirt.

‚ÄúWell, at least let me pack your lunch,‚Äù Helena insisted.

Alina sighed. ‚ÄúMom, I told you, the office provides lunch.‚Äù

Helena waved her off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to have something from home. You never know.‚Äù

By the time Alina left the house, her mother had handed her a neatly packed lunchbox. It was a small gesture, but it made her feel both cared for and slightly coddled.

\_\_\_

The journey to the company felt like an eternity. Her nerves were a tangled mess, tightening with every step closer to the towering building.

Before heading in, she made a stop at the caf√© across the street to grab Kyle‚Äôs morning coffee. Mrs. Daine had emphasized how important it was to get his order right. ‚ÄúHe likes it black, no sugar,‚Äù she‚Äôd said.

Balancing the coffee in one hand and her bag in the other, Alina stepped into the grand lobby of the company. The atmosphere was intimidating, filled with people walking hurriedly around her, phones ringing, and an air of focus so thick it was almost suffocating.

She made it to her desk without much trouble and took a moment to collect herself before walking into Kyle‚Äôs office.",1,1753530269.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Her name was Piper. All doe eyes and innocent smiles, exactly the type that Damien always loved. He'd been keeping her for over six months now.

Other than me, she was the woman who had stayed by his side the longest.

My friends kept warning me to watch my back. They swore something was different this time‚Äîthat Damien might actually marked her as his luna.

I first met Piper on my birthday, of all days.

I'd been getting nosebleeds since morning, so I dragged myself to the pack doctor. The news wasn't exactly a birthday surprise I'd been hoping for.

""Spring,"" he said quietly, not meeting my eyes. ""Maybe until next spring, if you're lucky.""

I just nodded. ""Okay.""

Death didn't scare me anymore. The pain, though... that was something else entirely.

There were medications that could help, expensive ones that might buy me some comfort in whatever time I had left.

But my accounts were running dry.

So I swallowed my pride and headed to Damien's office.

Of course, Piper was there‚Äîhis brand new ""secretary,"" fresh out of college with her business degree and doe-eyed ambition.

Damien was stuck in some board meeting, so I settled into the waiting area.

Piper kept staring at me like I was some fascinating specimen, whispering to the other staff just loud enough for me to catch every word.

""That's the Luna? God, she looks awful. All dried up and... I don't know, half-dead or something.""

She giggled softly. ""Everyone says I look like her, but come on. I'm way prettier, right?""

I caught my reflection in the glass partition‚Äîno makeup, drowning in an oversized coat, looking exactly as sick as I felt.

Fair point, honestly. I did look half-dead. Because I was.

One of the older secretaries tugged at Piper's sleeve, voice dropping to an urgent whisper.

""She's not done up, that's all.I saw her during the mating¬†[ceremony.Trust](http://ceremony.trust/)¬†me, honey, when she actually tries? Ten of you couldn't compete.""

""And listen carefully‚Äîshe‚Äôs the Alpha‚Äôs¬†[treasure.You](http://treasure.you/)¬†have no idea how much he loves her. You push too hard, and he'll destroy you without a second thought.""

Chapter 2

Word around the pack is that Damien's absolutely crazy about me.

Piper clearly doesn't buy it‚Äîshe rolls her eyes and makes this little scoffing sound under her breath.

She sets down a cup of coffee in front of me, her voice dripping with fake sweetness. ""Celine,luna,how could alpha Damien just... leave you waiting out here like this?""

""It's so weird,"" she continues, tilting her head with practiced innocence.

""Every other time I've come by the office, no matter how swamped he was, he'd drop everything to see me first. Said I was his top priority, you know?""

""Guess I thought he treated all his women that well...""

She smiles then‚Äîthis sickeningly sweet expression that reminds me exactly of myself at that age.

God,how ridiculous!

Thing is, she's not entirely wrong. Damien does treat her differently.

Sure, he had countless mistresses. They're all just props in his little revenge fantasy, tools to get under my skin. He parades them through our house night after night, waiting for me to crack, to finally show some jealousy.

Most of them? He gets bored within days, maybe weeks if they're lucky. Tosses them aside like yesterday's newspaper.

But Piper... she's different. He actually takes care of her.

Sets her up in that fancy downtown apartment, takes her to dinner, shopping, those cute little movie dates.

They look like any other couple in love when they're together.

He gives her money, sure. But he gives her attention too.

I study her face for a moment, then smile gently. ""If you're so important to him, sweetie, why do you think he keeps you as his dirty little secret?""

""Maybe you should convince him to break bond with me and make you his new Luna.""

Her mask slips instantly. Color drains from her face before flooding back in an angry rush.

""The unloved luna is the real mistress here,"" she hisses, leaning closer. ""You're the one who doesn't belong!""

""Just because you knew him first doesn't mean shit. Look at yourself‚Äîyou're old, you're pathetic. What could you possibly offer him that I can't?""

Her coworker scrambles over, probably worried I'll cause a scene or report back to Damien.

But honestly? I couldn't care less.

I made peace with this long ago. I won't get angry over Damien anymore. Won't let him break my heart or make me fight other women for scraps of his attention.

He's just not worth it!

Chapter 3

When the secretary yanked Piper back, she stumbled and went down hard.

The cup shattered against the marble floor, shards slicing deep into her palm. Blood pooled beneath her hand as she cried out.

Through the conference room's glass walls, Damien saw everything.

Every eye in that office watched as our Alpha abandoned his board meeting mid-sentence, scattering papers as he burst through the door. He scooped Piper up like she was made of spun glass, his voice dropping to that dangerous growl.

""Who the fuck hurt her?""

The poor secretary who'd tried to help stumbled backward, face chalk-white with terror.

I couldn't help but laugh. ""That would be me. And she deserved every bit of it!""

Piper's tears were perfectly timed, of course. She clutched at Damien's shirt, voice breaking just right. ""Yes, maybe I did deserve it! Maybe I deserve to be called a homewrecker, a mistress...""

""But Damien, as long as you love me even a little, I'll stay by your side forever. No one can tear us apart.""

Even her confession sounded brave and romantic instead of completely delusional. The girl had talent, I'd give her that.

Damien actually smiled‚Äîsoft and fond in a way I hadn't seen in years. He brushed her tears away with his thumb. ""Hey now, you're gonna ruin that pretty face if you keep crying.""

So yeah. She really was different.

I looked away, suddenly exhausted. ""It's my birthday. I need fifty thousand dollars.""

Pathetic, really. Married for three years, and we didn't even have each other's phone numbers.

The only time I sought him out was when I needed money.

That's how we'd arranged things before the mating ceremony‚Äîhe got my body, I got his money.

He'd always hated me for being such a gold-digger.

But until now, he'd never denied me. Whatever I asked for, he'd transfer double the amount without question.",1,1753529994.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best cactus candles offer a blend of aesthetic appeal, quality materials, and long-lasting fragrance.

**Wax Composition:** The wax used in cactus candles significantly impacts their burn time, scent throw, and overall quality.

High-quality cactus candles typically utilize natural waxes like soy wax, beeswax, or coconut wax. Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burn, sustainability, and ability to hold fragrance well. Beeswax offers a natural honey scent and longer burn times. Coconut wax is another excellent option, known for its clean burning properties and strong scent throw. Paraffin wax, while less expensive, is generally avoided in premium cactus candles due to its potential for soot and less desirable environmental impact.

**Scent Profile:** The fragrance of a cactus candle is crucial for creating the desired ambiance.

Many cactus candles feature scents inspired by the desert, such as agave, sandalwood, cactus flower, or desert sage. The quality of the fragrance oil is essential for a pleasant and long-lasting scent experience. Premium candles use essential oils or high-quality fragrance oils that are phthalate-free and non-toxic. The scent throw, or how well the fragrance diffuses into the room, should be balanced ‚Äì strong enough to be noticeable but not overpowering.

**Design and Detail:** The aesthetic appeal of a cactus candle lies in its realistic design and intricate details.

The best cactus candles accurately mimic the shapes and textures of various cacti species, from prickly pear to saguaro. Details such as spines, ribs, and flowering buds enhance the realism and visual appeal. Hand-poured candles often exhibit greater attention to detail and uniqueness compared to mass-produced options. The color and finish of the candle should also complement the overall design and aesthetic.

**Burn Time:** The burn time of a cactus candle determines its longevity and value for money.

Burn time depends on the size of the candle, the type of wax used, and the number of wicks. Soy wax candles typically burn for 40-60 hours per pound of wax, while beeswax candles can burn even longer. Multiple wicks can provide a more even burn and enhance scent throw but may also shorten the overall burn time. Proper candle care, such as trimming the wick before each use and avoiding drafts, can also extend the burn time.

**Wick Material:** The type of wick used in a cactus candle affects its burn quality and safety.

Cotton wicks are a common choice for their consistent burn and ability to hold fragrance. Wood wicks offer a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, adding to the ambiance. The wick should be appropriately sized for the diameter of the candle to ensure a clean and even burn. Self-trimming wicks are a convenient feature that minimizes maintenance and prevents excessive smoking.

Key features of the best cactus candles include:
* Natural wax composition (soy, beeswax, coconut)
* Desert-inspired scent profiles with high-quality fragrance oils
* Realistic design and intricate details
* Long burn time (40+ hours)
* Appropriate wick material (cotton or wood)

## Core Benefits

Cactus candles offer several practical and aesthetic benefits.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** The unique design and subtle fragrance of cactus candles create a calming and inviting atmosphere in any room. The soft glow of the candlelight combined with the desert-inspired scents can evoke a sense of tranquility and connection to nature. Imagine unwinding after a long day, surrounded by the gentle light and soothing aroma of a cactus candle, transforming your living space into a relaxing sanctuary.

**Decorative Appeal:** Cactus candles serve as eye-catching decorative pieces that add a touch of personality to any space. Their whimsical shapes and realistic details make them conversation starters and focal points in any room. Whether displayed on a coffee table, bookshelf, or windowsill, these candles enhance the aesthetic appeal of your home and reflect your unique style.

**Relaxation and Stress Relief:** The combination of candlelight and aromatherapy can promote relaxation and reduce stress. The warm glow of the candle helps to calm the mind and create a sense of peace, while the fragrance oils can have therapeutic effects. Scents like lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood are known for their calming properties and can help to alleviate anxiety and improve sleep quality.

**Unique Gift Idea:** Cactus candles make thoughtful and unique gifts for friends and family. Their novelty and aesthetic appeal make them a memorable present for any occasion. Whether it's a birthday, housewarming, or holiday, a cactus candle is sure to delight recipients and add a touch of desert charm to their lives.

## FAQs Section

**Are cactus candles safe to burn?**
Yes, cactus candles are generally safe to burn as long as they are used according to the manufacturer's instructions. It's crucial to place the candle on a heat-resistant surface, away from flammable materials, and never leave it unattended. Trimming the wick before each use and avoiding drafts can also help to ensure a safe and clean burn.

**How long do cactus candles typically last?**
The burn time of a cactus candle depends on several factors, including the size of the candle, the type of wax used, and the number of wicks. Soy wax candles typically burn for 40-60 hours per pound of wax, while beeswax candles can burn even longer. Proper candle care, such as trimming the wick and avoiding drafts, can also extend the burn time.

**Can I reuse the container after the candle has burned out?**
Yes, many cactus candles come in decorative containers that can be reused after the candle has burned out. Once the candle has completely cooled, you can remove any remaining wax and clean the container with warm, soapy water. The container can then be used to store small items, display plants, or as a decorative accent.

This was my first time renting a room from someone.
I was actually a home owner for 3 plus years so I do not know the reality of room rentals.
I joined a community called ‚ÄúRoomies‚Äù
and found a room for rent .
The man renting the room took a while to get back to me and was a bit vague in responses.
So long story short, I got the place and moved in.
We built a relationship in the near 3 months I lived there.

I designed & installed a color garden.
I changed out all the:soils and installed over $600 in plants/understory tree/mulch.
I professionally hard edged the property which hadn‚Äôt been done in years and blew out & off all the sand & crude that built up everywhere.

I even hired him for a days work.

Well this man was not what he said he was or the living conditions were super sketchy.
Monster cockroaches, even ran over my hand when I grabbed a coffee filter, just general filth that never entirely gets sorted.
He has multiple people over and someone with him nearly all the time.
People constantly coming by and looking for ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù.-he goes by the name Ghost but his name is Slex.
Some of those people hang around also until they talk to him and a handful of regulars.
I‚Äôll fill you in on all the crazy particulars later in this post with pics of this pigdome.

I had enough and decided to move out.
I only gave him 10 days notice.
I actually lost 4 days because I had to go to a Holiday Inn because he spray painted the bath tub with white spray paint!!
-right after I moved in.
I actually stepped in it and it stunk up the place and was not the correct product for the application.
I lost 4 days of living until the paint dried.

He was completely cool with moving out and said some nice things,
I had a move out date and went there and go took a load with my coffee maker and small stuff.
Most all of my stuff prolly takes up 15sqft if stacked correctly
I got injured working and had to get admitted for 2 days from a gnarly shin injury and infection.
I did not call him before the move out date, I was so tied up with stuff and dealing with the injury.

I called and went back by 10 days later and he changed the locks.
He was being very vague..kinda of jerk‚Ä¶then that snarky juvenile tone in the texts began.
HE WILL NOT ANSWER the phone or speak to me but will answer with his over & over texts.
He had all my belongings, my drivers license, my SS Card, my birth certificate , my guitar, amp, cabinet, years collection of NOS tubes, about $15-18k.
He never called me ONCE and gave my stuff to some girls brother.
He took the time & effort to contact and have someone come and pick up my belongings but didn‚Äôt try to contact me to come and get my belongings .
He has MULTIPLE storage areas completely out of the way of new renters or his daily functions.

He is now bribing me with this girls brother .
He wants money for all the work it was going through my belongings and claims it was difficult..WTF man.

The police will do nothing because he does not have to answer the door or let us in.
I have a pseudo-type Police report because I had them come out and meet me a few miles from the house.
This is so unbelievably insane words cannot express.. just insane.
He still will not meet me, or talk to me on the phone and threatens fo call the police if I come to the house and will NOT ‚Äúhelp ‚Äú me anymore if I bring the Police over there .


Please someone anyone out there in existence..I‚Äôve been ripped off and am being bribed.
Extortion..
Can anyone give me some suggestions?
Thank you so much..damn ‚Ä¶

- Clean your fridge every month or two( depends on how much mess you can make there). 
- Keep a ‚Äúlife drawer.‚Äù Tape, screwdrivers, extra keys, documents, receipts ‚Äî simple as it is.

1m9qvh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/1m9qvh4/tried_everything_for_chronic_postnasal_drip_and/,Tried everything for chronic post-nasal drip and nothing worked,"I'm sorry, I know there are a ton of posts like this already and mine is long-winded. And to be honest, I don't even know if my sinuses are the culprit.

But I've had constant post-nasal drip and subsequent throat clearing for about two years now. It's my only symptom - no sore throat, hoarse voice, cobblestone throat, congestion, cough, nasal discharge, polyps, heartburn, globus sensation, difficulty swallowing, nothing.

Stuff I have tried that has failed includes:

* Nasal sprays: Afrin, Sinex Severe, Simply Saline, Flonase, Sinu-Orega, Nasonex, Xlear, Astepro

* Sinus rinses: Saline, xylitol, Alkolol, baby shampoo, betadine, Lugol's iodine

* Antihistamines: Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra

* Reflux treatments: Omeprazole, Pepcid, Tagamet, Mylanta, Gaviscon

* Other remedies: Salt water gargling, alkaline water (drinking, gargling, spraying), drinking more water, Sudafed, steam inhalation

__________________________________________________

I went to an ENT last month who suggested silent reflux and has me taking 80mg of omeprazole and also suggested dietary/lifestyle changes, neither of which has worked. The changes I made included:

Reducing acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus (including my daily drink mixes that all have citric acid), quitting coffee, reducing spicy foods, not eating a few hours before bed and drinking more water.

Things I could not do or that did not help include: Sleeping propped up (I can only sleep laying flat, I have tried) and chewing cloves (they are super spicy and I couldn't feel my mouth for like an hour - they are disgusting, but I will try making them into tea instead)

___________________________________________________

I recently underwent a sinus CT and am waiting on the results because I also developed chronic sinus pain and have had it since the beginning of the year. I don't know if that is related to the post-nasal drip.

I personally do not suspect LPR because it is not responding at all to treatment and at-home changes. Meanwhile, when I experimented and intentionally ate spicy and acidic things, I found I did not feel worse.

Also, I've noticed that the mucus in my throat seems to change consistency and does not seem related to my fluid intake. It will swap back and forth between being too thick and very thin, but excessive. When it's thick, I might have to try 10-15 times to dislodge the mucus via throat clearing because it kind of feels like there is just enough there to be annoying, but not enough for my throat to ""grab"" onto and cough loose. Other times, I feel the mucus move on the first clear, but there is more of it than normal and I feel like I'm gargling. This happens on an empty stomach and with food, there is no rhyme or reason.

I did have COVID at least once and I have heard some people say this could be a long COVID symptom. I had some other bug earlier in the year that I think was either COVID or RSV that really laid me out for a couple days. But I don't know if there is a correlation.

__________________________________________________

Is there anything left to try? 

My ENT asked me to call back a month into the omeprazole with an update and they want to do a follow-up after hearing the omeprazole has not helped. But I don't know what they're even going to do when the ENT I saw in June said I had legitimately done ""every treatment known to man"" and he had nothing left to suggest. 

But then, he also tried to tell me that he could tell I had LPR by the way my throat clearing sounded and that he could just tell after a one-second glance in my nostrils with his eyes (not a scope) that there was nothing wrong with my sinuses. Sooooo I'm not sure what I'm going to get out of a follow-up aside from another $300 bill.

I still have two months left on my omeprazole prescription and I'll stick it out because Iut I don't know what's left to do. At this point, I would be happy to just treat the symptom itself rather than trying to treat whatever the root cause is.",1,1753528878.0,Sinusitis,1,1.0,False

I did.

My back was killing me, work stress was peaking, and suddenly those ads for ‚Äúluxury massage chairs‚Äù started looking like life rafts.

Spoiler: I did not feel like a genius for long.

**Buying the dream, getting the headache**

I hit ‚Äúbuy‚Äù at 1AM, convinced I‚Äôd finally wake up feeling human.

Next week, a giant box appeared on my doorstep.  
It was heavier than my self-esteem.

Unpacking took two hours.  
Assembly required more brainpower than I had.

By the time I plugged it in, I was sweating and already questioning my choices.

**The first week, honeymoon phase (sort of)**

At first, everything felt new and kind of fancy.

I took pictures. Sent smug texts.

Tried every mode twice.

Sure, the rollers hurt my wallet, but at least my calves were getting crushed in style.

But after day three, the thrill faded.

**Reality check (and the panic spiral)**

The chair took over half my living room.

It made noises that woke up my neighbors.

Programs promised ‚Äúdeep tissue bliss‚Äù but left me sore in weird places.

My cat decided the massage chair was his new $2000 scratching post.

Friends came over, tried it once, and never mentioned it again.

**The bank account pain**

Every new bill was a reminder.

Credit card statement?  
Ouch.

Electric bill?  
Turns out, running a massage chair every night adds up.

I started skipping coffee runs just to pretend I was ‚Äúsaving‚Äù somewhere.

Regret set in, then buyer‚Äôs remorse, then creative excuses for why I still owned the thing.

**What actually helped (and what I‚Äôd do differently)**

* *Do not buy late at night when you are tired or emotional.*
* *Measure your room first. Twice.*
* *Read real reviews especially the angry ones.*
* *Ask yourself if you will use it when you are not feeling fancy or stressed.*
* *Set a budget and then lower it by half before you even look at the ads.*
* *Borrow or rent before you commit. Test in real life, not just in your imagination.*

**How to survive post-purchase regret**

* Sell it sooner rather than later if you hate it. Value drops fast.
* If you keep it, use it every day for a month. Sometimes you grow to love it, sometimes you don‚Äôt.
* Hide your purchase from any friends who love ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù
* Turn it into a charging station, bookshelf, or pet throne if nothing else.

1m9qtvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m9qtvy/on_our_wedding_night_alphas_regret_false_mate/,"On our wedding night | Alpha's Regret: False Mate, True Luna","On our wedding night, I signed a divorce agreement that would take effect in three years.  
My Alpha husband, Ferris, handed me the cold contract, his voice devoid of any warmth:  
‚ÄúI have a beloved partner who has temporarily left me. For the next three years, you will simply take her place as my Luna.‚Äù  
I accepted it all quietly and obediently‚Äî  
Three years were enough for me to plan a perfect exit.  
He sneered, ‚ÄúBoring Omega she-wolf.‚Äù  
When the contract finally expired, he thought I would remain his loyal shadow forever.  
But he was wrong‚ÄîI never intended to stay.  
In the darkness of night, I dialed that long-forgotten number: ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôve accepted the Black Mountain pack‚Äôs marriage proposal.‚Äù  
Later, at the solemn clan ceremony, Ferris watched helplessly as I linked arms with the Black Mountain Alpha, radiant with glory.  
In that moment, the world he had meticulously built crumbled to pieces.  
He finally understood that what he had let go of was not a temporary substitute‚Äî  
but the one and only true Luna destined by fate to resonate with his soul.

""I just sent you a divorce agreement. Alpha Ferris and I signed it on our wedding day three years ago. Could you check if there are any issues?""

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, my fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of my phone.

""Luna, I've reviewed the agreement. Everything looks fine.""

My lawyer's professional voice came through the speaker.

""There's one month left before the three-year term expires. Once it's up, the divorce will automatically take effect. You'll be free to leave the Silver Moon Pack and start fresh.""

""Thank you.""

I hung up and lifted my gaze to our wedding photo on the wall.

In the picture, I wore a pristine white gown, smiling so wide my eyes curved like crescent moons.

Beside me stood Alpha Ferris in his tailored suit‚Äîdevastatingly hands0me, yet not even a hint of a smile graced his features.

Love versus indifference. Crystal clear.

""That day's finally coming. You must be thrilled,"" I whispered to myself, my fingertip gently tracing the cold, sharp lines of the man's face in the photo.

The sound of keys jingling at the front door made me quickly pull my hand back and turn around.

""I'm home.""

I took Ferris's suit jacket as he shrugged it off, then squatted down to help him into his slippers.

My movements flowed with practiced precision, like I'd rehearsed this routine a thousand times.

Ferris loosened his tie, his expression remaining distant.

""Next month's Moonlight Gala for the Silver Moon Pack‚ÄîI need you there as Luna.""

Thinking about that divorce agreement set to activate in one month, my hands paused while folding his jacket.

I shook my head. ""I can't make it.""

""Why not?"" Ferris frowned.

I opened my mouth to explain, but suddenly something clicked in his mind. His eyes turned glacial.

""Is this because I've been spending time with Ashley? Are you jealous?""

""I told you on our wedding day‚ÄîI'm in love with someone else. You said you wouldn't interfere.""

My heart clenched violently, like someone had torn it wide open.

Right. My mate, my Alpha, had told me on our wedding night that he already had a she-wolf he truly loved. He'd only married me to shut up the pack elders.

Not only that, but on our wedding night, he'd forced me to sign an agreement to divorce after three years.

Looking at Ferris's irritated expression, I managed a weak smile.

He thought I was jealous. Throwing a tantrum.

I am merely fulfilling his wish by leaving the Silver Moon Pack next month, so I will not be able to attend the banquet.

He must be ecstatic. Soon he'd be free to marry his true love.

With a bitter smile tugging at my lips, I reminded him, ""Ferris, do you remember the agreement we signed three years ago?""

Three years ago, the Silver Moon Pack and Stardust pack announced their upcoming alliance through marriage.

These were two of the wealthiest and most powerful packs in the werewolf world. With their heirs becoming mates, both packs would reach unprecedented heights of strength and prestige.

I'd harbored a secret crush on Ferris since childhood. Learning I'd become his Luna had sent me over the moon.

But on our wedding night, Ferris handed me divorce papers.

""I'm in love with someone else. Her name is Ashley Carter. Since she's an omega, my father refuses to let her become my Luna.""

His tone was cold, his words brutally direct. ""I need three years to become Silver Moon's true Alpha. After that, no one will dare oppose our union.""

""For these three years, we'll just play the role of husband and wife. Then we divorce.""

That night, I signed as he wished, then cried in the bathroom until dawn.

But less than three months after our wedding, Ashley vanished without a trace after a fight with Ferris.

Ferris went crazy searching for her. He pulled every string, used every connection, but found nothing.

During that period, he'd stay out all night, coming home reeking of alcohol with terrifyingly dark eyes.

Until one night, he stumbled home completely wasted and pinned me to the bed.

His kiss crashed down on me, heavy with alcohol, but he whispered, ""Ashley... why did you leave? Why are you with someone else? Don't you trust me?""

My entire body went rigid. My heart felt like someone was crushing it in their fist‚Äîthe pain nearly suffocating.

So... he'd found her.

But Ashley was with someone else now.

That night was my first time, yet Ferris held me while calling another woman's name until sunrise.

The next morning, Ferris saw the blood on the sheets. His eyes flickered with something unreadable, but he said nothing.

I acted like nothing had happened, preparing his fresh clothes and even gently reminding him about his important meeting before he left.

I pretended everything was fine, but inside, I was bleeding out.

Married for three years, secretly married for three years. The Silver Moon wolves knew their Alpha had taken a Luna, but only a select few knew her name or what she looked like.

I didn't care about any of that. From then on, I became even more careful about taking care of Ferris.

Ferris was always buried in pack business, frequently skipping meals. At night, his stomach would cramp with excruciating pain.

So I'd wake before dawn every day, spending hours brewing medicinal herb soup.

When he was exhausted, I learned massage techniques to ease his tension.

He loved quiet, so I never made noise around him. I hid my naturally cheerful, sunny personality and even softened my footsteps.

Gradually, Ferris seemed to accept me as his mate.

He started giving me small gifts on holidays.

When I fell ill, he'd personally hunt down rare herbs based on the healer's prescriptions.

He'd even hold me close during the night, his palm pressed against my waist, his body heat scorching.

Ferris never mentioned divorce again, as if that agreement had never existed.

I was naive enough to believe that maybe, just maybe, he could learn to love me.

Until three months ago, when Ashley returned to the Silver Moon Pack after her breakup.

Ferris rushed back to her side almost instantly.

He'd take her to dinner, go shopping with her, even cancel crucial pack meetings because Ashley mentioned feeling ""a little down.""

Standing at the window, watching Ferris's car head toward Ashley's apartment yet again, I finally understood.

True love is true love. No matter how much I gave, it could never compete with a single glance from Ashley.

At least the three-year contract marriage was finally ending.

I told myself these three years had been nothing but a dream.

Now the dream was over. Time for me to leave.

""The agreement from three years ago?""

Ferris's voice snapped me out of my memories. I stared at him in shock, my throat tightening.

He... didn't remember the divorce agreement?  
These three years, I'd been counting down every single day, terrified that the moment our contract expired, he'd leave without hesitation.

Yet now, he seemed to have completely forgotten about it.

I opened my mouth to remind him when Ferris's phone suddenly rang.

The moment he answered, Ashley's tear-choked voice came through the speaker.

I couldn't make out her words, but I watched Ferris's expression shift dramatically.

""Don't be scared. I'm coming right now.""

He hung up, grabbed his car keys, and bolted for the door.

In his rush, his shoulder slammed hard into my body.

I stumbled backward, my spine hitting the doorframe with enough force to make me gasp in pain.

But Ferris never looked back. His figure had already vanished through the doorway.

I steadied myself against the wall and slowly made my way back to the bedroom. When I removed my jacket, a dark bruise was already blooming across my shoulder.

I retrieved the first aid kit and silently applied ointment to the injury, feeling like my heart was being carved open with a dull blade, slice by agonizing slice.

I sat on the bed's edge, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside until my phone rang.

Ferris.

""Come to Silver Pine General Medical Center.""

My heart lurched. ""What happened?""

""Just get here.""

When I arrived, I spotted Ferris standing outside the operating room from across the corridor. Ashley was nestled against his ch3st, crying pitifully.

My steps faltered. Something clamped around my ch3st, making each breath a struggle.

""What's going on?"" I approached them, keeping my voice soft.

Ferris looked up at me. ""Ashley's mother has acute leukemia. She needs an immediate bone marrow transplant.""

I blinked in confusion. ""And?""

""We've tested everyone in Silver Moon Pack, including myself. No matches."" Ferris's tone remained flat. ""You have a donation record on file at the medical center. You're compatible.""

My pupils contracted as disbelief washed over me. ""You want me to donate bone marrow?""

""It's your responsibility as Luna.""

Ferris closed his eyes. When he opened them again, only cold determination remained. ""Hold her down.""

At his command, several warriors stepped forward and gripped my shoulders. One pulled out a syringe.

""Ferris Vargan!"" I struggled desperately. ""I already donated years ago‚ÄîI can't donate again! This will kill me! Let me go!""

""If you do this, my father and the entire Stardust pack will never forgive you!""

The warriors hesitated, their grip loosening as they looked to Ferris for guidance.

""You'd tell any lie to avoid donating."" Ferris's voice turned glacial. ""Hold her. I'll take full responsibility for any consequences.""

The warriors didn't dare defy their Alpha. They pinned me down as the needle pierced my skin.

The anesthetic worked quickly. My consciousness began to blur, my strength fading until I couldn't fight anymore.

A healer spoke quietly nearby: ""Alpha Ferris, this surgery requires a family member's signature.""

Ferris took the pen and paper. ""I can sign right now.""

Family member...

My heart clenched violently.

Right. Legally, I was still his Luna.

This was the first time he'd so readily acknowledged me as his Luna.

And it was only so I could donate bone marrow to Ashley's mother.

How fu/cking ironic.

The nurse handed over the surgical consent form. Ferris wrote his name with careful, deliberate strokes.

For some inexplicable reason, his pen hesitated mid-signature, and a sharp pain shot through his ch3st.

Ashley urged him gently, tears glistening in her eyes. ""Are you having second thoughts?""

Ferris's gaze flickered, but he said nothing. He finished signing and watched as I was wheeled into the operating room.

The moment those doors closed, my tears finally fell.

So this was how deeply Ferris loved Ashley‚Äîenough to sacrifice my life for her sake.

Ferris, I'm never going to love you again.

The surgical lights blazed on while the corridor fell silent except for the sound of breathing.

After I disappeared behind those doors, he stood at the corridor's end, staring at that cold, steel barrier for what felt like hours‚Äîlike a caged wolf unable to catch his mate's scent.

He tried to sit but lasted only seconds before springing back up to pace restlessly.

Only when he saw me being wheeled out of surgery did he finally exhale.

""How is she?""

The doctor removed his mask, but his expression remained grave. ""The surgery went smoothly, but the Luna's body is... extremely weak. Recovery will be difficult. She'll need careful, constant care.""

Ferris nodded. ""I'll go see her.""

He'd barely taken a step toward the patient room when a hand caught his arm.

Ashley.

""Ferris,"" she said softly, ""the beta just came from the Werewolf Council. They need you back immediately to handle the border territory dispute. It can't wait any longer.""

""I know you're worried about her, but you're the Alpha. The pack has to come first.""

Ferris's throat worked as uncertainty flashed in his eyes.

Ashley stepped forward, blocking his path. ""Go handle pack business. I'll stay and take care of her. I promise, when she wakes up, I'll be the first thing she sees.""

Ferris nodded and left the hospital with his subordinates.

I don't know how much time passed before I slowly opened my eyes after surgery.

I turned my head with difficulty, my throat feeling like sandpaper. My first instinct was to search for‚Äî

Ferris.

But the person in my line of sight was Ashley.

She smiled at me. ""You're finally awake. Thank you, Aurora. You saved my mother.""

I looked up at her without speaking.

Ashley wiped away tears, her voice thick with emotion. ""I really never imagined... after all these years, Ferris would still love me this deeply.""

She paused, as if lost in memory.

""Do you know? Last year on my birthday, he flew all the way to Paris just to bring me a necklace... It was a design I'd mentioned liking once in passing, and he actually remembered all that time.""

""But I was still angry with him then. I threw the necklace right back at him and wouldn't even let him through the door.""

My fingers clenched violently, nails digging deep into my palms.

I remembered perfectly. Last year, Ferris had told me he was traveling to Mississippi for business negotiations with the Ghost Wolf Pack.

When he returned, he'd brought back a necklace and casually given it to me.

I'd been overjoyed, treasuring it in the bottom of my jewelry box‚Äîtoo precious to even wear.

But it turned out... that was Ashley's reject, something he'd carelessly passed along to me.

Ashley continued, ""And the Christmas before last, I had a huge fight with my boyfriend at the time and posted something really depressing on Instagram. When Ferris saw it, he flew over that same night and stood outside my apartment building all night long. It was snowing heavily, but he just stood there, never daring to come up and knock.""

My heart twisted painfully.

I remembered that Christmas night‚ÄîFerris had been unusually passionate, making love to me seven times straight until dawn.

That entire night, he'd been rough and relentless in bed. Even when his harsh movements hurt me, I'd gritted my teeth and endured it.

Because I thought he was finally starting to feel something for me.

When I woke up the next morning, the bed beside me was already cold. I assumed he'd left to handle urgent pack business.

It turned out... he'd rushed off to see Ashley.

""These past three years..."" Ashley's tears fell again. ""I've been stubborn, deliberately avoiding contact with him. But Ferris never forgot me for a single day. He wrote me a letter every day, even though I never once replied.""

I suddenly found it hard to breathe.

How many late nights had I seen the study light on, thinking he was handling pack affairs? I'd even brewed coffee specially to bring him.

It turned out... he was writing love letters to Ashley.

I'd always believed that at least during Ashley's absence, Ferris genuinely wanted us to become a real married couple.

Now I understood. From beginning to end, it had all been my own delusional fantasy.

The heart I thought I'd finally warmed belonged entirely to someone else.

Seeing Ashley about to continue, I abruptly stood up.

My face was pale as paper, but I forced my voice to remain calm. ""I'm not feeling well. I need to rest.""

A flash of triumph crossed Ashley's eyes. ""Of course, you just had surgery. You should rest more.""

Her footsteps finally faded outside the door.

I lay on the hospital bed with my eyes open, staring at the blank ceiling.

After discharge, I silently packed all my belongings, waiting only for the divorce agreement's expiration.

During this time, I could track Ferris's activities daily through Ashley's social media‚Äî

The surgery had been successful, but he never once came to check on me. Instead, he immediately arranged the finest private room for Ashley's mother, flew in top medical teams from abroad, and personally supervised every treatment plan.

Ashley's latest Instagram post was a photograph.

Ferris knelt on one knee, tying her shoelaces.

Her caption read: \[I'll never meet anyone who loves me this much again.\]

My heart clenched violently. Tears splashed onto my phone screen, blurring the image of Ferris's tender profile.

I remembered how I'd cared for him with the same devotion all these years.

When his stomach troubled him, I'd brew medicinal soups daily.

When work kept him busy, I'd leave the lights on waiting for his return.

Every piece of fruit I brought him was peeled, cored, and cut to perfect bite-sized pieces...

But now he was doing these things for someone else.

I took a deep breath, wiped away my tears, and mind-linked Ferris.

After a long pause, Ferris responded coldly, ""I should have told you not to interrupt when I'm working‚Äî""

For the first time, I cut him off:

""Ferris, let's break our bond.""",1,1753528718.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

My former best friend ""Kate"" (27F) and I were inseparable from middle school through university. She was my maid of honor in my mind long before I was even engaged. When Kate got married two years ago, I took two weeks off work, helped her plan everything, and spent thousands of dollars on her bridal shower and bachelorette.



About a year after her wedding, Kate found out she was pregnant. Around that time I got engaged to my fianc√© (28M). I asked Kate to be my maid of honor and she said yes. Then she vanished. She stopped responding to texts, ignored calls, and never showed up for my engagement party (her husband came alone and told me Kate wasn‚Äôt feeling well). I sent her check‚Äëins, offered to bring her groceries or anything she needed, but she never replied. She didn‚Äôt even like or comment on the pictures we posted from the party or my ring. I figured she was overwhelmed so I gave her space.



Six months went by with radio silence. Meanwhile I was going dress shopping, tasting cakes and making decisions I had always imagined sharing with her. She never reached out. It hurt, but I accepted that maybe we‚Äôd grown apart. Eventually she sent me a message saying she‚Äôd had a rough pregnancy and been suffering from postpartum depression, that she‚Äôd needed to ""hibernate"" and asked to meet up. I was happy to hear she was okay. We went to coffee and she apologized for ghosting me. She cried and said she felt like a bad friend, but then she asked if she was still my maid of honor. I told her gently that I‚Äôd asked another close friend to step in after months of not hearing from her and that my bridal party was already full. She looked shocked and said I should‚Äôve known she‚Äôd be back, that motherhood is hard and I should be more understanding. She even hinted that she expected me to host a baby shower for her now that she was ready to socialize again.



When I told her I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable planning something so big again so soon and that I was hurt by her disappearing act, she got upset. She said I was punishing her for having a baby and that I was selfish for ""making everything about myself."" I reminded her that she had also missed my graduation a few years ago to go on a spontaneous trip with her now‚Äëhusband, so it felt like a pattern of me being there for her and her not showing up for me. She told me to ""grow up"" and that she‚Äôd pray for me. Now she and some mutual friends are blasting me in a group chat saying I‚Äôm being cold‚Äëhearted and that refusing to let her be involved in my wedding is petty because she was dealing with postpartum depression and couldn‚Äôt be there.



Part of me wonders if I should just suck it up and let her back in my bridal party, but another part of me feels like our friendship isn‚Äôt what it used to be and I can‚Äôt trust her to actually show up or not make it about herself. I do empathize with postpartum struggles, but I also feel like she could‚Äôve sent a two‚Äëline text to let me know she needed space.



So, AITA for not inviting my former best friend to my wedding and for not giving her the maid of honor role back?",43,1753528075.0,AITAH,39,1.0,False
1m9qluu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cta/comments/1m9qluu/the_case_for_and_against_returning_conductors_to/,The case for (and against) returning conductors to the L,"When a conversation about safety on CTA comes up, one idea often making the rounds is the return of conductors. Advocates say a second crew member would speed up trains, defuse sketchy situations, and reduce delays. Some have discussed using them to supplement or even replace armed police on our transit system. With smoking on CTA all over the news, maybe they could be an extra pair of hands to help yell at said smokers. CTA‚Äôs very own union has advocated for the return of conductors. Conductors were found on the L for most of its history, and people weren‚Äôt happy to see them go. You still see people grumbling about it today, my favorite facebook post about them was ‚ÄúCTA got rid of conductors in an effort to increase crime.‚Äù Haha, very funny, much boomer humor.

So why did we get rid of them in the first place, and would it be worth it to bring them back?

This will be a fairly long post thoroughly discussing the concept of conductors on CTA trains. Their history, roles, the philosophy behind the ‚ÄúOne Person Train Operation‚Äù or OPTO approach CTA currently uses, how other rapid transit systems in America and beyond view conductors, how we got rid of them, what it would take to bring them back, and what we would get out of it. This subreddit is composed mainly of neurotically pedantic rail fans so if something is incorrect please feel free to correct, disagree, or call me a shill for whatever cause you find most convenient. There is a TL;DR if you want to scroll to the end.

**What‚Äôs a conductor?**

The person driving the train from the head car is often referred to as a conductor. This person is an operator, they operate the train. They used to be called motormen. A conductor, as most rail systems use the term, is a person who operates the train doors, checks tickets and/or collects fares, makes announcements, assists passengers, signals the operator when it is safe to depart, and otherwise helps ensure a smooth ride. Many countries call them ‚Äúguards.‚Äù CTA used conductors from its founding until they were phased out in the late 90‚Äôs.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/g6wbaqj7a7ff1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=74b0ce45b008cd9d183b6a2d08b2fc880c004f51

Conductors were positioned about half way down the length of a train, and worked in full public view. This picture scanned from a Chicago rail fan magazine called First and Fastest, shows where a conductor would set up shop. Circled are the control boxes conductors would use to operate doors. You‚Äôre looking at the ‚Äú#2‚Äù end of a 2600 series rail car, or the end opposite of the motorcab. Their equipment was located on odd numbered cars, before 2000-2600 series trains were overhauled and the boxes removed. They would signal the operator using a buzzer built into the box. This buzzer is still installed on every CTA train, and has its niche uses. You can still see remnants of conductors, like the step they would use while looking out the window, on older cars.

https://preview.redd.it/w5mubiw8a7ff1.png?width=3108&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3b49d781cf90a1f24c9ab4f267c5cd464f5d51

If you‚Äôve sold part of your soul to Zuck and have a facebook account, this video is a fantastic example of a CTA conductor in action: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/120452714691417/permalink/28273999955576649/?mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=H2ur2cv8Pk36PZM1](https://www.facebook.com/groups/120452714691417/permalink/28273999955576649/?mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=H2ur2cv8Pk36PZM1)

Back in the day, CTA trains physically could not run without two crew members. First, the operator used to be tucked away in one-half the space they are now. They had no door control box opposite of them, so if doors opened to the left they‚Äôd have no way to work them. Second, many stations curve in a way where the operator can‚Äôt see down the length of their train from the head car. Somebody could be stuck in a door five cars down and the operator would have no way of knowing. Diversey and Sedgwick on the Brown Line are good examples of this, as is Roosevelt Elevated on the Green/Orange. Third, it was deemed too much work and risk for a single person to do alone, an attitude that persisted up to when conductors were removed.¬†

The Yellow line was the sole exception, being a one-crew operation when it opened in 1964. This line used special cars, the 1-50 series, which came equipped with full-width cabs, allowing the operator to work both sides, and a weird looking farebox built into said cab to assist with tickets when there was no agent at a station.¬†

One fun fact about conductors from people who were around to experience them: Back when conductors were required for a train to function, what happened if you were an operator whose conductor didn‚Äôt show up for work? If there was nobody to replace them, your trip would be ‚Äúdropped,‚Äù and you wouldn‚Äôt go out at all. This would sometimes create a situation where an operator would love their partner because they never came to work, so they got dropped more often. This personnel problem still happens in systems with conductors, where trips can be cancelled if an operator lacks a conductor or vice versa.

**One-Person-Train-Operation, and how it became possible**

One-person-Train-operation, or OPTO - Also referred to as Driver-Only-Operations in other countries - is the philosophy of operating a transit vehicle with only an operator. While cost savings were certainly the motivating factor, CTA switched to an OPTO model around the time many transit agencies around the world were doing the same. Los Angeles has used OPTO since its light rail system opened in 1991. The London Underground gradually converted to an OPTO regime from 1984 to 2000. The Marunouchi Line in Tokyo, which carries over two million riders daily, has been OPTO since 2009. TTC, Toronto‚Äôs transit system, was one of the last holdouts using conductors on its subway trains but has recently phased them out. Paris, Hong Kong, Moscow, the list goes on: two-man crews tend to be a thing of the past on rapid transit systems.

On the CTA, our Orange Line was designed from the start with OPTO in mind. It became the first non-Yellow Line OPTO route when it opened in 1993. The Brown Line followed, then all but the Red and Blue, until finally by the end of 1998 the entire system was OPTO.¬†

What changed that allowed OPTO where it had been impossible before? First was the introduction of full-width cabs, where the operator had the ability to control the doors on both sides. Our 3200 series was the first to be equipped with such a feature, and these trains were all that operated on the Orange Line when it first opened. Some 2200, 2400 and all 2600 series cars were retrofitted with full-width cabs, which is why the earlier picture looks so different compared to a modern 2600.

Second was the installation of CCTV cameras at stations where the operator‚Äôs view is obstructed. Again, you can see these TV cameras at many stations. These cameras range in quality from ‚ÄúServiceable‚Äù to ‚ÄúNot very serviceable.‚Äù Some systems install cameras in the train itself for the operator to reference. Third was installation of modern features like the Passenger Intercom Unit, or PIU, or the button that you pressed in a desperate attempt to stop the man from smoking on your rail car. Fourth is the widespread use of two-way radios for the operator to stay in contact with the control center while leaving the motorcab.¬†

Where conductors still exist, they‚Äôre often in a bitter fight for survival. In New York City, the vast majority of MTA‚Äôs subway lines still need conductors. A small number are OPTO during certain times of the week. Some are equipped for OPTO yet still make use of a conductor. When MTA tries expanding OPTO, they face stiff resistance from the union and riders alike.¬†

One example: MTA‚Äôs ‚ÄúL‚Äù line carries 300,000 people per day, or more than twice as many as CTA‚Äôs Red Line. In 2005, the L line became OPTO-compliant, but OPTO service ended barely a year later due to a combination of passenger safety concerns and extensive lobbying from the transit union.¬†

Those passenger concerns are fairly universal. In Toronto, about 6-in-10 Torontonians disapprove of eliminating subway guards. Is that really what they‚Äôre called? Torontonians? That‚Äôs what it says on this PDF file. It makes them sound like aliens. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to war with the Torontonians.‚Äù And in Sydney, their worker‚Äôs transit union put together an entire brochure coming to the defense of their guards when the New South Wales government purchased intracity trains which could run with only an operator. This brochure could be read exactly like something written here Chicago, honestly: *‚ÄúWe know that many people, particularly women, report that they do not feel safe on our public transport as is. Removing guards will make that an even worse. Guards are the first port of call in the event of an emergency on our trains, and the mere presence of a guard can act as a deterrent to inappropriate or worse behavior.‚Äù*

Chiefly though, unions and workers say it‚Äôs a safety issue. Operating a train is too big a responsibility to leave in the hands of one person. CCTV cameras malfunction all the time, how is the operator supposed to guarantee the safety of their passengers when that happens? A conductor catches things an operator might not, and they make passengers feel safer. When it comes to an emergency situation - such a flooding subway tunnel - having a second person is instrumental.¬†

Proponents of OPTO, which includes many transit advocates, counter that these concerns are misplaced or even counterproductive. They argue that OPTO systems are often just as safe, or even safer, than their two-crew counterparts. From 2012 to 2019, New York‚Äôs subway had an injury/death ratio of 1.54 per million rides. The OPTO-equipped MBTA in Boston had one of 1.44, and Washington DC‚Äôs metro was at 1.36. Chicago‚Äôs was 2.2 if you‚Äôre wondering, lol. The RSSB, the UK‚Äôs rail safety regulator, reports its own studies have shown no increased risk from driver-only operation. Lastly, a presentation from TTC is quick to point out no subway system has ever reverted to two-crew operation on the grounds of safety.¬†

The New York Subway‚Äôs operating costs are also exceedingly high when compared to other systems. Many point out New York is unique as one of the only rapid transit systems in the developed world to still make use of two-person crews, contributing to their unusually high expenses.¬†

But this is not a ‚ÄúShould the MTA keep conductors‚Äù post. Some weird lady once said we all exist in the context of what came before us, and hopefully now you have more context as to why conductors went away when they did, how people felt about it, and how systems have made do. Yes, cost cutting was the primary motivating factor, but the decision to remove conductors was not unique to CTA.

**Adjusting to life without conductors**

The phasing out of CTA conductors does not appear to have been a terribly smooth experience.

The CTA was a different beast back in the late 90‚Äôs. While the last conductors were gone by 1999, the automated announcements we love weren‚Äôt introduced until 2000. PIU‚Äôs weren‚Äôt installed on every train, and Full-width cabs weren‚Äôt fully deployed. The Chicago Tribune quoted one Green Line rider in 1997:

*‚ÄúAt each stop where the platform is in the center (rather than on the outside track), the motorman had to leave his cab, walk across the train, open the window, make his announcements, open the doors, close the doors and walk back,‚Äù Kelner said. ‚ÄúI timed it after a while, and it added about 30 seconds per stop.‚Äù*

The decision to remove conductors was harshly received by CTA operators and riders alike. Some operators opted to switch jobs all together. The very idea of something like stepping off the train, leaving the passengers alone while fixing something, was completely alien. And even then, removing conductors was seen as a concern for late night passengers, with one interviewee saying they‚Äôre more likely to drive later at night, now that they couldn‚Äôt sit in the conductor‚Äôs car.

Over time, things have improved for operators. Whereas for the first few years they would make manual announcements at each stop, the train was eventually blessed with Lee Crooks‚Äô distinctive voice. The task of helping passengers with tickets never fell on operators, and eventually even customer assistants stopped handling cash.

The train would never be *quite* as fast as it was with a conductor manning the doors, but it could get close. When doors open to the right, the operator can open them just as soon as a conductor would have, perhaps a second or so later. When they open to the left, the operator is required to bring their train to a complete stop, walk to the other side of the cab, operate the doors, and walk back. This adds, oh, lets call it five seconds a station. Sometimes more, sometimes less if they‚Äôve had their coffee. And it‚Äôs not a 1-to-1 trade; the conductor would still have to signal the operator that it is safe to proceed.

‚ÄúTroubleshooting‚Äù the train is where a conductor could really make some time. Troubleshooting typically comes in two flavors: The crew turns something off and back on, or they turn it off completely and deal with it at the terminal.¬†

For instance, a train can experience a problem with a parking brake being stuck on. Just like if a car or bike has a brake stuck, it‚Äôs going to drag noticeably, while the smell of brakes and sight of smoke is unpleasant to most riders. When the parking brake is deployed, a yellow light engages on the side of a rail car. So to troubleshoot your 2600 series train, you have to look out the window and find which car still has that yellow light shining. While a conductor is well positioned to find the problem from halfway down the train, the operator has a much more limited field of view. The conductor could simply step outside at a station to find the light. A lone operator has to wait for a curve, ask for help from a passing train, or hope really hard it‚Äôs close enough to see.¬†

Dynamic brakes are what slow the train down from 55 to 6 MPH, before the parking brake kicks in. A dynamic braking failure is especially fun for an operator to find on their own, because they can only find it while the train is in motion. This involves waiting for a curve, putting the train in brake, and sticking your head out the window - playing frogger with oncoming buildings, trees, and signals - to find the defect. You can imagine why a conductor might make this easier.

One more example is a malfunctioning door. A 2600 train manned by a sole operator experiences a door issue: Maybe one is failing to close, maybe a kid pulled a door because they were playing Subway Surfer and missed their stop. Either way, the operator has to physically find that door. The conductor, already positioned halfway down the train, would be able to find it far more quickly and get the train moving that much sooner.

All in all, I think it‚Äôs fair to say a conductor would cut a delay down by a third or half, depending. Or from six minutes to three minutes.

In 2011, the 5000 series train was introduced. These trains are equipped with a computer which tells the operator where the problem is. Now the operator knows they need to cut out the parking brakes in their third car, or reset a door in the fifth, before they even leave the cab. This greatly reduces the amount of time it takes to troubleshoot a problem and helps make up some of that loss from not having a conductor.

Then, finally, there‚Äôs the big benefit when discussing the need for conductors. If something happens, be it a fight, a smoker, or something sketchy, the operator is typically *it.* A second, uniformed employee would make intervening much less risky for CTA personnel, right? This is much harder to put a statistic to.

In 1997, when this same point was a concern, the CTA reported there had been no increase in crime on lines which had eliminated conductors. The MBTA got rid of conductors fairly recently, 2012. If conductors made their system safer, you‚Äôd expect crime to increase without them. In fact, just before the pandemic, the MBTA boasted that the T had experienced its four safest years in history.

Yet, conductors make people feel safer - and sometimes that‚Äôs enough to make people happy. It‚Äôs why people still rush to get into the head car with the operator. That feeling of safety is real regardless of statistics and conductors undoubtedly contributed to that.

**The Modern Conductor**

Lets say CTA decides to bite the bullet and bring conductors back. Money is no object, we‚Äôre doing it live. Conductors today would be quite different compared to their older counterparts, bringing new challenges to daily operations. Nothing insurmountable, but if this is what you‚Äôre advocating for, you should know what you‚Äôre buying into.¬†

First, money is no object but this is going to cost money. In 1997, the CTA said removing conductors would save them $13.8 million ‚Äúin the new year.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear if the Tribune article means conductors all together, or removing conductors from the remaining lines who still had them. $13.8 million in 1997 would be just shy of $28 million today.¬†

Another way to consider the cost: There were 784 qualified rail operators at the end of 2024, per CTA‚Äôs 2025 budget. Call it 800 right now. Let's say we want 600 conductors, three for every four trains. An operator‚Äôs top pay is currently $41.73 / hour. Say conductors make about 75% of that. Our Conductor makes $34 an hour, or about $70,000 per year. They need benefits, so call it $100,000 per operator, per year, for CTA.¬†

That comes to $60 million a year in just payroll. You could get that number down, maybe only the Red and Blue lines will have a conductor.¬†

To put that in perspective, in 2024 CTA budgeted $185 million to buy 208 electric buses. They received $200 million in federal money to purchase ‚Äúup to‚Äù 300 7000-series rail cars, which cost about $1.5 million a pop. They budgeted $189 million to the quarter-life overhaul of 5000 series cars, and¬† just shy of $60 million to a program that would modernize the propulsion systems of 3200 and some 2600 series rail cars. $88.47 million is budgeted for security.

‚Äî-------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have the money, we need to decide where our conductor is going to work. This is overly pedantic but it‚Äôs what you signed up for when you clicked this post. Obviously they‚Äôre not going to be working in public view like they used to, the tools don‚Äôt exist anymore. You‚Äôre going to need to stuff them in one of the motorcabs. Imagine you have an 8-car train. You have two options:

* In the middle of the train like they used to: You would need to remove passenger‚Äôs ability to use the emergency exits on the fourth and fifth cars to keep them out of the operator‚Äôs work space. This may be a benefit or a cost depending on your perspective. This would deeply confuse passengers who try to cross and remove a small amount of space from both cars.
* At the end of the train, like Toronto did: You would remove less space while keeping the train mostly accessible to passengers. However, you would need to install new CCTV equipment as they have the same problem of not being able to see the whole platform at certain stations. Expensive, but certainly doable.

Finally, you need to make a decision: Are you going to *require* all trips to have a conductor, or are you going to allow operators to work alone if one is not available? There are examples of both in various transit agencies. Option 1 will cause trains to be cancelled when conductors inevitably don‚Äôt show up to work. Option 2 will annoy operators and potentially the union.

It‚Äôs finally happened. You‚Äôre a Red Line operator with your very own conductor. What can you expect to be different?

* With a conductor operating your doors at all 33 stations, you can expect somewhere in the neighborhood of 2-3 minutes of time savings per trip from Howard to 95th. For reference, CTA claims a train can get from Howard to 95th in an hour and three minutes.¬†
* You can expect things like losing a door relay to cost you two minutes instead of four; maybe one out of every five trips or so this makes a difference.
* A mechanical issue like a parking or dynamic would take three minutes instead of six; this might help one out of every forty trips or so. This is less of a one-to-one trade. The conductor may or may not be positioned closer to the problem than the operator. And the train is going to tell them where the problem is, anyway.

Passengers may start gravitating towards the fourth or fifth car as they get used to a conductor again. Congratulations, you‚Äôve made history as the first OPTO subway system to fully revert back to two-crew operations.

**Final Thoughts and TL;DR**

CTA‚Äôs decision to eliminate conductors was mainly about cutting costs, but it was also part of a worldwide trend championed by transit agencies across the world. New technologies and procedures have made much of their role *within the context of CTA* obsolete. They used to make announcements; they wouldn‚Äôt do that anymore. They used to collect fares; they wouldn‚Äôt do that anymore.

Imagine the CTA gets thirty million dollars extra a year, with no risk of it going away. Would conductors be the best use for this money? I don‚Äôt think it would be. True, conductors would make service a little faster, more reliable, and likely improve at least the perception of safety. But they would do all of these things poorly compared to alternatives.

* Conductors would speed up the average passenger‚Äôs trip by less time than it takes to microwave a hot pocket. If you want faster trains, removing one modest slow zone per line would be more effective. Might as well spend that money on track maintenance.¬†
* There is limited evidence that conductors would improve safety. I don‚Äôt want this to get sidetracked into a discussion about what *would,* but whatever option you want would be cheaper. If all you want is an unarmed, uniformed presence on the system to be visible and yell at smokers, LA‚Äôs transit ambassador pilot cost $123 million for a five year contract, or $24.6 million per year. CTA actually did have Customer Assistants ride subway trains as quasi-conductors at the tail end of the 90‚Äôs. There is no universe where they'd be operating doors today, though. Advocates have laid a lot of groundwork for an ambassador style program already, some proposals for CTA‚Äôs future included such a thing.
* While conductors would reduce delays during mechanical failures, you might be better off banking that money for ten years and buying a bunch of new trains. Or just hiring more shop workers.

Conductors are easy to advocate for. They don‚Äôt have political baggage, older people have fond¬†memories of them, and they‚Äôre an easy sell to the public. But in an era where we want our transit system to look more like Europe, bringing back conductors would do the exact opposite. It would make Chicago an outlier not only in North America, but across the world. We would be spending more money than we used to, to get an employee that does less than they used to. And it‚Äôs a lot of money, even the smaller $30 million number is nearly 4% of the Fiscal Cliff, on just one item. And their main selling point, what I think could be argued as their *only* selling point, the ability to provide an extra point of safety whether that is real or perceived, is better accomplished with other tools.¬†

Don‚Äôt get my wrong, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the best use for the money‚Äù is not damning criticism. I am not anti-conductor. I do not subscribe to ACAB (All Conductors Are Bad). I do not have a sign that reads ‚ÄúSTOP CONDUCTORS TODAY.‚Äù¬† CTA has certainly spent more money on dumber stuff. Perhaps circumstances could change. CTA has indicated interest in the past - and appears to be making steps towards - running ten-car Red Line trains. Perhaps conductors would make more sense then.

But if you‚Äôre an advocate for public transit and you‚Äôre trying to decide where to spend your energy, I don‚Äôt think two-crew trains are the best choice. You might disagree with that, but hopefully this post has been an interesting read.",6,1753527919.0,cta,1,0.8,False

If you are a senior, you can ignore it or provide your feedback (Most Welcome).

With the rise of AI, I have realised that hiring trends have changed, and the focus is mostly on senior developers. So, I decided to build a project template and picked up a few advanced skills that are needed to level up as a developer. As a junior-mid developer, I didn‚Äôt go deeply into a lot of these highly valuable skills & tools for the first 1-2 years.

Spend 2-3 weeks on this, and I can assure you that your skills will have improved by 30-50% making you feel more confident and also interview-ready, or at least you will have learned and applied many of the important skills. This has worked for me.

I created a project for myself, which I have now decided to share with others as a template. It has a detailed guide of 50+ todos, each with What/Why/How, for this project, broken down into Backend, Frontend, Testing, DevOps & CI/CD, Optimisations, etc. The project is a Todo-Habit tracker, which looks simple at first glance, but it isn‚Äôt (trust me, it‚Äôs good to start when you want to enhance and learn your skills).

Tools & Technologies you can expect to learn while completing this project

* Backend: APIs, middlewares, refactoring, error handling, security, validation, RBAC, billings
* Frontend: Live updates via Web sockets, Framer motion, accessibility, validation & error handling, advanced flows, RBAC, optimisations, handling advanced & complex flows
* Performance: Redis, React Memo & useMemo, virtual scrolling, image optimisations, service worker, error boundaries, API response caching, etc
* Testing: using Jest + Cypress

Some features you will be tackling:

* Sharing Todos or Habits with others
* Web Sockets
* Payments integrations
* Levelling up the UI using Framer Motion
* Redis caching, frontend optimisations, security layer, and middlewares, rate-limiting
* Docker, CI/CD pipelines

The application follows an applied-learning methodology, and some basic features of the application are written as a starting point. It is developed in a very basic way with many missing parts, so that you can jump in and develop them or refactor the existing implementation, thinking like a senior developer.

Important note: this project will serve as a starting point only, with a full guide with 50+ todos categorised in multiple areas. You will have to implement these tasks yourself by applying and searching the internet, or brainstorming with ChatGPT.

I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing is hot flashes. I only think it may be hot flashes because it's begun happening since I lost my boobs and genitals and hair and missed a period etc etc. I had an episode once and it lasted about 10 minutes, and then I had another episode a few weeks later, but now months later I am pretty much constantly feeling the horrible feeling, especially when I should be feeling is the ovulation power-up. Like right now I should be ovulating but instead I am extremely dizzy, and I feel like I'm being wrung out, on fire. It feels kind of like lupus flare or fever or something. It doesn't feel ""hot"", it feels like the acid reflux feeling in your throat except it's everywhere in my body. Also I feel insane and have excruciating anxiety attacks which I have never had before. That feeling isn't at the same moment of the acid burning though. It is just random anytime. And I burst into tears too.

My question is: Can hot flashes be like 50-80% of the day? Where it's more like you have a flash or two of feeling okay/not awful?

Also of course I am wondering if other people experience their hot flashes this way. It's not covid. It's not electrolytes. It's not alcohol coffee candy etc. I have no iron in my body so that could be part of it. Also low white blood cells.

I am a Seoulite and have been living here for more than 10 years. When I first came to Seoul to attend university, I went sightseeing like a tourist. I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Insadong, and Samcheong-dong. I still love those places so much, and whenever my friends from other countries come to visit, I take them to those spots.

But as a Seoulite, I sometimes want to find places where I can truly relax and feel at ease, away from the crowds. Over time, I‚Äôve discovered two of my favorite therapeutic spots in Seoul:

1. Kyobo Bookstore in Gwanghwamun ‚Äì This is one of the largest bookstores in Korea, and I love the comforting atmosphere filled with the scent of books and subtle fragrances from diffusers scattered around the store. It‚Äôs also a great place to browse not only books but also a wide variety of stationery items, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.


2. Cafe Coffee at Works in Center One ‚Äì This caf√© has a calm and cozy vibe, making it perfect for unwinding with a good cup of coffee. I often come here to read or catch up on overdue work, and it‚Äôs especially nice for spending quiet time by myself.

However, the surroundings are clean, and there are plenty of trees, so it‚Äôs also a nice place to enjoy a bit of nature in the middle of the city.

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever describe juicing as peaceful before, but this product genuinely lives up to its reputation for reduced noise‚Äîa feature that immediately caught my attention. Early mornings were no longer about waking up the entire household just because I needed my daily kale-apple juice fix. This machine delivers a calm, almost meditative juicing experience. That‚Äôs not something I thought I‚Äôd appreciate until I experienced it firsthand.

**Compact and Functional Design**  
The sleek, upright structure of this juicer is perfect for my painfully overcrowded kitchen counter. It measures just 8.07‚ÄùD x 10.24‚ÄùW x 12.8‚ÄùH, making it a true space-saver. I‚Äôve had larger, bulkier juicers in the past that felt like design afterthoughts, but this one nestles in neatly between my blender and coffee maker. Its charcoal finish looks modern and clean, even after enduring the occasional splash of beet juice. I also noticed its lightweight build (only 5.64 pounds), which makes it easy to move around when needed. But let‚Äôs be honest, I hardly ever put it into storage because it‚Äôs just that easy to keep out without feeling like it‚Äôs in the way.

**Ease of Assembly and Cleaning**  
One of my biggest frustrations with juicers in the past has been how fiddly they are to set up. BLACK+DECKER nailed it with the easy twist assembly. It‚Äôs intuitive, even for the perpetually sleep-deprived. Taking it apart for cleaning is just as simple. The dishwasher-safe component design is a much-appreciated bonus. Running a quick rinse of the strainer still feels necessary before loading it into the dishwasher, particularly when dealing with pulp-heavy fruits like oranges. The included easy-clean brush has become my new best friend for clearing out bits of pulp and debris before they stick like industrial glue. Having tested this multiple times daily for a week, I didn‚Äôt find myself dreading the post-juice cleanup, and let‚Äôs face it‚Äîthat‚Äôs rare.

**Key Benefits**  
- Quiet operation that‚Äôs genuinely less disruptive.
- Compact upright design ideal for small spaces.  
- Simple twist assembly makes it beginner-friendly.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts and included cleaning brush simplify maintenance.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Its 400-watt motor is surprisingly effective considering its relatively small size. I‚Äôve thrown everything at it, from dense carrots to pears, and the separation between juice and pulp was consistently clean. The single-speed button control might seem too basic for some, but honestly, it did everything I needed it to. Juicing apples took mere seconds, and leafy greens like spinach didn‚Äôt leave me wishing for extra horsepower. The non-drip spout really stood out while transferring the juice to a glass. Just a twist, and you prevent sticky messes‚Äîa small but crucial detail.

That said, the plastic blade material didn‚Äôt immediately strike me as the most durable choice for long-term use. It hasn‚Äôt shown wear yet, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to fare well against extremely fibrous produce over many years. Its quieter performance comes with some trade-offs in materials that feel less industrial-grade.

**Drawbacks**  
- Plastic blade material may not last as long as stainless steel alternatives.  
- Limited to one speed setting, which might feel restrictive for some advanced users.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Having spent time exploring other juicers to compare, I feel there are certainly pros and cons depending on your priorities. For instance, the Breville Juice Fountain boasts faster juicing and boasts a stainless steel build, but it‚Äôs significantly louder and far bulkier. For anyone tight on counter space or working around a family sleeping schedule, that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Omega masticating juicers, on the other hand, offer even quieter performance and better nutrient retention but come at more than double the price. The BLACK+DECKER Quiet Juicer finds a sweet middle ground for casual users who want fresh juice without much fuss.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Investing in this product feels reasonable if you‚Äôre focused on reliability without overly complicating the juicing process. It‚Äôs a straightforward machine aimed at people who enjoy their morning juice but aren‚Äôt trying to live the full-time raw food lifestyle. Competing models at higher price brackets may tempt you with superior materials or more versatility, but the value lies in the simplicity and effectiveness here. You don‚Äôt overpay for bells and whistles‚Äîjust the essentials done right.

Hello, I want to know if anyone ever had similar experiences:

I always enjoyed mythology and old religions, but the things I know about the Egyptian pantheon are near nothing. I know the name of the more ""main-stream"" gods, and I watched the Mummy when I was little... and that is all of what I knew (so really near no knowledge at all). Just for clarification. 
I also remember the dreams vividly, but will not share most of the details, only the things that got my attention the most.

A few years back I took a very big decision, a leap of fate of sorts, since then I have been having Egyptian deities visiting me in dreams and it is way more often that I am going through a very difficult moment in my life. 

The first one was Anubis (about 4 years ago), in the dream I knew it was him. No jackal head, just a man with dark skin in a very beautiful formal suit and he handled me teeth (animal and human if I remember correctly) to keep me protected against ""something"".
 
The second one was also Anubis (3 years ago), now with the Jackal head and traditional outfit and he offered me a choice that I refused at the time. We were at the middle of the desert, in between 4 pillars with many hieroglyphs, but those pillars supported nothing. The dream ended with my refusal.

The third one happened a month ago. I was an investigator looking for a crocodile headed god that disapeared in greece but I could not remember his name at all. So I went to the house of this man that I knew would have info about this god to me. That man was Thoth, no traditional ibis head, but I knew it was him. He took a certain ""liking"" to me and was amused by my questions so he gave me the info I wanted. His house was big and full of big windows so you could see the orange sand outside. It was full of papers and books and coffee mugs in a very disorganized way, but at the same time that chaos made a lot of sense.

The fourth one happened yesterday and it was Osiris. But in the dream I saw him as ""my father"" at first and later in the dream other gods (some who I knew, some who I didn't) indicated to me that he was actually Osiris ""you know who we are so you know who is he"". I had to find him, his body was hidden somewhere. I remember the smell of the body in decomposition when I found him, the blue-ish color of his skin... and he just say thank you and walked away. 

I have no idea why I am having those dreams, and there is A LOT that I confirm is related to their imageries and stories AFTER I wake up and do some good  research. 

If someone can shed some light on why I am having those dreams and if you had similar experiences I would love to know. 

Thank you all. 

Edit: 
I always had premonitory dreams since I was very little, and I always know when I am having one of those. Those dreams feel like the premonitory ones, but there is something different about them I cannot explain. ",3,1753527208.0,occult,4,1.0,False

If you are a senior, you can ignore it or provide your feedback (Most Welcome).

With the rise of AI, I have realised that hiring trends have changed, and the focus is mostly on senior developers. So, I decided to build a project template and picked up a few advanced skills that are needed to level up as a developer. As a junior-mid developer, I didn‚Äôt go deeply into a lot of these highly valuable skills & tools for the first 1-2 years.

Spend 2-3 weeks on this, and I can assure you that your skills will have improved by 30-50% making you feel more confident and also interview-ready, or at least you will have learned and applied many of the important skills. This has worked for me.

I created a project for myself, which I have now decided to share with others as a template. It has a detailed guide of 50+ todos, each with What/Why/How, for this project, broken down into Backend, Frontend, Testing, DevOps & CI/CD, Optimisations, etc. The project is a Todo-Habit tracker, which looks simple at first glance, but it isn‚Äôt (trust me, it‚Äôs good to start when you want to enhance and learn your skills).

Tools & Technologies you can expect to learn while completing this project

* Backend: APIs, middlewares, refactoring, error handling, security, validation, RBAC, billings
* Frontend: Live updates via Web sockets, Framer motion, accessibility, validation & error handling, advanced flows, RBAC, optimisations, handling advanced & complex flows
* Performance: Redis, React Memo & useMemo, virtual scrolling, image optimisations, service worker, error boundaries, API response caching, etc
* Testing: using Jest + Cypress
* In-Code Todos within the files

Some features you will be tackling:

* Sharing Todos or Habits with others
* Web Sockets
* Payments integrations
* Levelling up the UI using Framer Motion
* Redis caching, frontend optimisations, security layer, and middlewares, rate-limiting
* Docker, CI/CD pipelines

The application follows an applied-learning methodology, and some basic features of the application are written as a starting point. It is developed in a very basic way with many missing parts, so that you can jump in and develop them or refactor the existing implementation, thinking like a senior developer.

Important note: this project will serve as a starting point only, with a full guide with 50+ todos categorised in multiple areas. You will have to implement these tasks yourself by applying and searching the internet, or brainstorming with ChatGPT. Don‚Äôt use AI to complete the code of this project if you really want to learn.

I'm a Hopeless Romantic looking for an emotional connection with someone I can call my best friend, my family, my life partner and everything. Someone who understands me, completes me, makes me feel loved, cared for and whole.

Someone I can laugh with, have deep conversations with and care so much about in this whole world as if she is the only person that matters.

I'm a Simple man who treasures every moment of his life. I love Humor, watching wrestling, football, movies, shows, listening to music and going out to enjoy the weather and get a good meal at a good restaurant or a coffee.

When I get time, I like writing my own original songs and stories, make YouTube videos or work on my future Business ideas.

I'm a Muslim by faith but Spiritual. I believe religion. Is one's own personal connection to God so it's just your heart that matters to me. 

If your love is as deep as the ocean and as bright as the stars and eyes that a man can drown in. If your words and conversations provide comfort to my soul and your touch heals my soul, what more can I ask for? That's the woman I want to settle down with.

If you believe you are that woman, feel free to send me a chat. I'd love to know you better and see where this goes.

Also, I live in Massachusetts, United States but I don't mind which part of the US you're from, Europe, Canada or Austrailia. I believe if there's a match and strong love in the future, then true love has the power to close the distance. Where there's love, there's always a way!

1m9qade,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1m9qade/boyfriend_accused_me_of_cheating_im_at_a_loss/,"Boyfriend Accused Me of Cheating, I'm at a Loss","Hey guys. Oh wow it's my first time posting here and I really can't believe it's come to this.

  
I moved to another country and have been dating my S/O for about three years now. I was in an abusive/BPD relationship in the past that was hell to get out of, but I left (not without the stalking, threats, etc) and the move really helped.

  
Fast forward to today. My relationship has been beautiful, but my boyfriend is extremely jealous. I've always been flattered by this but there are times where (only when drinking, admittedly) we've gotten in the sort of fights that are reminiscent of those I would have with my ex. Also admittedly, there has been one time where I lied about hanging out with a group of my roommate's friends when they were over at my house, which included guys, because I didn't want him to get jealous, but the next day I felt so guilty about covering it up that I told him. This was about six months into the relationship. It was just a couple hours and I didn't want to just stay holed up in my room. This was almost a break-up because he assumed I cheated, which I have never done and would never do, but I can see why this would affect him and I worry that he's never moved past it. (I know, I feel so stupid for lying, it's just he was having a bad day and for some reason I just thought this would be easier).

  
Other context: he has a contentous relationship with a baby mother who did cheat on him in the past, and that messed him up pretty good. So I've also chalked these jealousy issues up to that, but overall, I never made the BPD connection. I've encouraged him to start going to therapy and I thought it was helping. 

  
This brings us to last night. My boyfriend was on a staff night out with three of his co-workers, while I was out with my friend and her boyfriend. My friend has been estranged from her brother for a few years, and she mentioned that he was performing in a gig and that they've recently made up so she wanted to go to the gig. I love live music and told him that she wanted to go to a gig, but that I wanted to see him too, so I went to meet up with him and his coworkers (male and female) for a drink. I invited the whole group to come to the gig, because obviously I want my partner and my friends to hang out!

So, we all go, and in the process I mention that it's my friend's brother's band, even pointing him out to the female coworker. We sit and enjoy the music, my friends sitting a bit away and me sitting at a table with my boyfriend and his coworkers. I'm having a great time when all of a sudden the coworkers leave, as the woman's husband is picking her up, and literally as soon as they leave, my boyfriend turns to me, and his eyes completely change, and he starts interrogating me about why I didn't mention it was my friend's brother's band in my texts to him earlier. I had just texted him that we were going to a gig and I would love for us all to meet up at some point, my exact verbiage being ""a gig."" I just say ""I don't know"" over and over because I don't. He is demanding an answer and like refusing to let me break eye contact and saying ""just tell me the truth"" over and over and over. I'm dumbfounded because 1) Who cares 2) Why would I have taken him to a gig if I was being shady at all 3) I did mention it to the larger group.

He starts asking me whether I was hanging out with the brother earlier and what I was doing all day (I went for a coffee with the friend whose brother it is, which is when I learned about the gig, she and I went shopping for a bit and then I went home for dinner). I was texting him the whole time. His thing is that he finds it so weird that I didn't mention this, which sure, if I WAS hiding something, I could see, but WHAT IS THERE TO HIDE????

Anyway, this horrific scene continues for an hour until he says he's getting a taxi (he's never left me like that before), I can't believe my friends are witnessing this, and I go to the bathroom and cry to my friend for awhile. Then my boyfriend comes back, is a bit less angry, and asks to leave. But as soon as we're outside he's walking off ahead. We live in a small city but it's still late, I'm still drunk, and I was appalled that he would just leave me by myself. I stop and smoke a cigarette and eventually he calls me asking where I went. He comes and we sit in silence for a while before ultimately getting a taxi home.

We slept and this morning he wakes me up with more questions, scrolling through our text conversation pointing to where I referred to ""the gig"" and saying how it's so shady and he doesn't believe me. HE ALSO SAYS, ""You didn't even invite us to the gig, \[female coworker\] is the one who suggested it,"" which is SO INFURIATINGLY UNTRUE as I was zealously suggesting we all go listen to the music there, said the name of the place, was so so happy to have everyone meet each other.

1m9q8o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m9q8o8/does_the_cuisinart_dgb850_coffee_maker_live_up_to/,Does the Cuisinart DGB-850 Coffee Maker Live Up to the Hype?,"Using the Cuisinart DGB-850 daily has been an enlightening experience, showing me the quirks and perks of this automatic burr grind and brew thermal coffeemaker. It's not my first rodeo with coffee machines, but this one has a charm of its own‚Äîand a couple of caveats too. This renewed gem promises top-tier coffee making as it rolls the grinding and brewing process into one cohesive operation. Being refurbished didn't bother me much; it's clear they took care to ensure the machine functions like new, which is a huge plus. So how does it stack up to expectations? Let me spill the beans‚Äîpun intended.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker isn't small, but its sleek, silver-and-black aesthetic made it a chic addition to my kitchen countertop. Measuring approximately 10.75""D x 14.25""W x 19.25""H, it may dominate smaller spaces, but I appreciated its presence‚Äîit looks like it means business. The thermal carafe with a comfort-grip handle is my favorite bit; it's functional and keeps coffee warm for hours without compromising flavor. I also noticed the burr grinder's professional-grade quality. Ensuring uniform consistency, it felt like a major step-up compared to blade grinders, which can be harsh on coffee beans. For those concerned about longevity‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry. While it‚Äôs refurbished, the build feels solid and reliable, as though it‚Äôs fresh out of the box.  

**Usability and Daily Functionality**  
Operating it was a pleasant surprise. The extra-large LCD display was more intuitive than I anticipated, allowing for smooth navigation of its 24-hour programmability. The grind control was a dream‚Äîtailoring it for anywhere between four to ten cups was fantastic for a solo morning or weekend brunches with friends. Brew Pause made sneaking a mug mid-brew a no-mess affair, a mercy for my caffeine-fueled impatience. I liked how the burr grinder portion seamlessly dispenses grounds directly into the brew basket, thanks to the ""DirectFlow"" grind feature. A small but valuable touch is the AutoRinse technology, ensuring every bit of coffee ends up in the pot where it belongs, not stuck in the grinder. Pretty handy for lazy cleanups, which I unabashedly appreciate.

**Performance and Flavor Quality**  
Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîall the bells and whistles don‚Äôt mean a thing if the end result tastes awful. Thankfully, that wasn‚Äôt my concern here. With options ranging from regular to bold or extra-bold flavor strengths, I could fine-tune my morning brew like a barista. The half-pound bean hopper with its sealed lid was a gem for keeping beans fresh‚Äîa small yet impactful detail. One weekend, I tested the ‚ÄúGrind-Off‚Äù feature with pre-ground coffee, and it worked just as smoothly. Despite all these wins, I did notice it requires proper tweaking to achieve consistent results with different beans. It‚Äôs not entirely foolproof; you may need to experiment initially to strike the right balance of grind size and water ratio until you hit your sweet spot.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Thermal carafe, keeping coffee warm for hours while preserving flavor.  
- Burr grinder‚Äôs consistency exceeds expectations compared to traditional blade grinders.  
- Grind control flexibility for small or larger batches.  
- Easy programmability, making it user-friendly even for beginners.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Its bulky dimensions can overwhelm limited counter space.  
- Achieving consistency with certain beans takes trial and error.  
- Cleaning the grinder may feel a bit fiddly for more particular users.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking it up against rival coffee makers, such as the Breville Grind Control or Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed, revealed some interesting contrasts. Breville‚Äôs slightly pricier but offers a more robust grind customization system, delivering even more precise results‚Äîbut its carafe doesn‚Äôt retain heat as well. Meanwhile, Ninja‚Äôs versatility with tea brewing puts it in a different category, yet its grinder is far less refined compared to this Cuisinart‚Äôs burr system. What sets the DGB-850 apart is its balance of affordability, solid performance, and focused coffee-centric features that cater to those who prioritize brew strength and fresh grinding while not doubling the budget.

**Cost Efficiency**  
In terms of financial value, this product operates at an excellent intersection of quality and cost-efficiency. The fact that it‚Äôs ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù lowered its price point, so you‚Äôre essentially getting high-end features for an accessible rate. Although setbacks (like cleaning intricacies) exist, the savings more than justify it for coffee enthusiasts unfamiliar with fancier gadgets. What I didn‚Äôt skimp on was grinding quality, and that alone made up for the splashy size.

1m9q82j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOccult/comments/1m9q82j/egyptian_gods_keep_appearing_on_my_dreams_but/,"Egyptian gods keep appearing on my dreams, but this pantheon is the one I know the less.","Hello, I want to know if anyone ever had similar experiences:

I always enjoyed mythology and old religions, but the things I know about the Egyptian pantheon are near nothing. I know the name of the more ""main-stream"" gods, and I watched the Mummy when I was little... and that is all of what I knew (so really near no knowledge at all). Just for clarification. 
I also remember the dreams vividly, but will not share most of the details, only the things that got my attention the most.

A few years back I took a very big decision, a leap of fate of sorts, since then I have been having Egyptian deities visiting me in dreams and it is way more often that I am going through a very difficult moment in my life. 

The first one was Anubis (about 4 years ago), in the dream I knew it was him. No jackal head, just a man with dark skin in a very beautiful formal suit and he handled me teeth (animal and human if I remember correctly) to keep me protected against ""something"".
 
The second one was also Anubis (3 years ago), now with the Jackal head and traditional outfit and he offered me a choice that I refused at the time. We were at the middle of the desert, in between 4 pillars with many hieroglyphs, but those pillars supported nothing. The dream ended with my refusal.

The third one happened a month ago. I was an investigator looking for a crocodile headed god that disapeared in greece but I could not remember his name at all. So I went to the house of this man that I knew would have info about this god to me. That man was Thoth, no traditional ibis head, but I knew it was him. He took a certain ""liking"" to me and was amused by my questions so he gave me the info I wanted. His house was big and full of big windows so you could see the orange sand outside. It was full of papers and books and coffee mugs in a very disorganized way, but at the same time that chaos made a lot of sense.

The fourth one happened yesterday and it was Osiris. But in the dream I saw him as ""my father"" at first and later in the dream other gods (some who I knew, some who I didn't) indicated to me that he was actually Osiris ""you know who we are so you know who is he"". I had to find him, his body was hidden somewhere. I remember the smell of the body in decomposition when I found him, the blue-ish color of his skin... and he just say thank you and walked away. 

I have no idea why I am having those dreams, and there is A LOT that I confirm is related to their imageries and stories AFTER I wake up and do some good  research. 

If someone can shed some light on why I am having those dreams and if you had similar experiences I would love to know. 

Thank you all. 

Edit: 
I always had premonitory dreams since I was very little, and I always know when I am having one of those. Those dreams feel like the premonitory ones, but there is something different about them I cannot explain. ",1,1753526534.0,AskOccult,0,1.0,False

If you are a senior, you can ignore it or provide your feedback (Most Welcome).

With the rise of AI, I have realised that hiring trends have changed, and the focus is mostly on senior developers. So, I decided to build a project template and picked up a few advanced skills that are needed to level up as a developer. As a junior-mid developer, I didn‚Äôt go deeply into a lot of these highly valuable skills & tools for the first 1-2 years.

Spend 2-3 weeks on this, and I can assure you that your skills will have improved by 30-50% making you feel more confident and also interview-ready, or at least you will have learned and applied many of the important skills. This has worked for me.

I created a project for myself, which I have now decided to share with others as a template. It has a detailed guide of 50+ todos, each with What/Why/How, for this project, broken down into Backend, Frontend, Testing, DevOps & CI/CD, Optimisations, etc. The project is a Todo-Habit tracker, which looks simple at first glance, but it isn‚Äôt (trust me, it‚Äôs good to start when you want to enhance and learn your skills).

Tools & Technologies you can expect to learn while completing this project

* Backend: APIs, middlewares, refactoring, error handling, security, validation, RBAC, billings
* Frontend: Live updates via Web sockets, Framer motion, accessibility, validation & error handling, advanced flows, RBAC, optimisations, handling advanced & complex flows
* Performance: Redis, React Memo & useMemo, virtual scrolling, image optimisations, service worker, error boundaries, API response caching, etc
* Testing: using Jest + Cypress
* In-Code Todos within the files

Some features you will be tackling:

* Sharing Todos or Habits with others
* Web Sockets
* Payments integrations
* Levelling up the UI using Framer Motion
* Redis caching, frontend optimisations, security layer, and middlewares, rate-limiting
* Docker, CI/CD pipelines

The application follows an applied-learning methodology, and some basic features of the application are written as a starting point. It is developed in a very basic way with many missing parts, so that you can jump in and develop them or refactor the existing implementation, thinking like a senior developer.

Important note: this project will serve as a starting point only, with a full guide with 50+ todos categorised in multiple areas. You will have to implement these tasks yourself by applying and searching the internet, or brainstorming with ChatGPT. Don‚Äôt use AI to complete the code of this project if you really want to learn.

I am charging a very low amount for this project template, so you can still buy a morning coffee after spending money on this and upgrade your skills.",0,1753526264.0,nextjs,1,0.5,False

Me and my friends got tired of the office rut and started a filter coffee powder business to break out of the routine and make something for our lives. We put a lot of effort to source the highest quality coffee powder, product design, packaging and even got it listed on Amazon.

However, the business is failing to take off. As of now I just have 50 orders in a month from Amazon, which is probably from friends and family. This was very demotivating for us.

Anyway I did a bit of YouTube and Reddit research and came across Lattafa Khamra Qahwa. Pretty much all reviews were very positive for this fragrance. I love coffee and the smell of it so I think that may have been what pushed me over the line. I paid $60 aud for it so not sure if that‚Äôs good or bad? I blind bought it from Amazon so haven‚Äôt smelt it yet and hopefully I made a good decision. 
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

I spent all my days off at the hospital with dad in his previous stay the past 2-3 weeks (the hospital stay before this stay).

But today, I‚Äôm just very, very‚Ä¶tired.

I‚Äôm really upset too, because this is fucking bullshit. 
I love spending time with dad, but today is not like any other day. I really want to just sleep in my chair or bed. I have not had a true day off in months. It feels so unfair. Just work and then hospital with dad. My shitty sibling works from home in her underwear. She sleeps most of the day and only is on the phone for like 4 hours. 
Yet she complains and says I don‚Äôt do enough. Me‚Ä¶who has a physically demanding job and right after that job, I go shower then go to stay with dad and then straight to work again the next day. How is this fair to me and my family? She goes to do family things when she wants to. But me? No.

Anyway, gonna drag myself to the shower now and grab some coffee before heading out. People got no kind of empathy man.

For context, I'm a middle aged woman feeling a bit down on myself atm. Recent business/cashflow stress has led to some stress eating and I'm feeling broke and unattractive, lol. Also, the weird weather sucks. We had originally talked about going to the festival in Kenora today, I really wanted to but I cant atm because of money. (Had a customer back out on a big job AFTER they gave me the go ahead.) Then I decided a relaxing beach day would be just the thing, but the forecast of intermittent T-storms squashed that. My SO is taking me out tonight, but he won't do things he doesn't like. That's usually a non-issue because we like a lot of the same things, but sometimes I wish we could eat ice cream together, go kayaking, or listen to jazz on the Sunset Terrace. (He doesn't like jazz, or outdoorsy stuff or ice cream.) We're gonna do dinner and The Fringe. it will be fine, (I like both things) but I feel like I want something else that sparks joy. I'm ok with something smaller (it's the simple joys) but happy for any suggestions. I went to the mall yesterday hoping to find a shirt that would make me feel cute but no luck.
