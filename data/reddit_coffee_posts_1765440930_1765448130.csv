I used to believe that earning more money would make everything easier. But the harder I chased it, the heavier life became, like I was always behind some invisible finish line.

Living more slowly here changed that. I rent a small apartment, study, exercise, walk by the beach, and spend time with friends. Sometimes we play little things online together, even simple stuff like the slash free mini-game on TikTok, just for a quick laugh before we go back to our day. I cook simple meals with fresh ingredients from the market. My spending naturally became lower, yet life feels fuller than ever.

I’ve realized that a low-cost life can still be a very good one. Money matters, of course, but once I stopped treating “earn more” as my main purpose, everything softened. For the first time in a long while, I feel at ease.

Sometimes a cup of coffee, a bit of sunlight, and a quiet evening by the ocean are enough.",1,1765448105.0,simpleliving,0,1.0,False

He’s not the biggest fan of things that are too hard as he can’t take them apart so he absolutely loves any kind of stuffed animal (they’re his favourite), obviously bully sticks and other chewing bones, easy to destroy coffee wood, carton boxes sometimes and anything he can get his hands on in our home (we had to completely redecorate and improvise). 
We recently bought a red kong and he really liked chewing it, it’s soft but durable, however lost interest fast when he realised he can’t tear the rubber apart. Are we giving him too many options to choose from which makes him lose interest too quickly??

Here’s the Kind of Love I’m Ready to Give (and Receive),"I’m 24, and I’ve never had a real relationship. Not even a short one. I’ve had a couple of dates that fizzled out, but nothing ever turned into something steady. I usually tell myself it’s no big deal, I’m young, I’m busy, I’m focusing on myself, but the truth is, I get lonely. The quiet kind of lonely that hits when you realize you don’t have someone to text about your day or someone who’s excited to see you come home.
I’m not looking for pity. I just want to share what I’m actually hoping for, because maybe someone out there feels the same way.
I want the simple, everyday stuff that makes a relationship feel warm and real.
I want to wake up next to someone and make her coffee exactly how she likes it before she’s fully awake. I want to learn her little habits, how she takes her tea, which side of the bed she prefers, the song that always makes her smile, and do small things to show I noticed.
I want lazy weekends where we stay in bed too long, talking about nothing and everything, then cook breakfast together while we bump into each other in the kitchen and laugh about it. I want to hold her hand on walks just because it feels right, not for show.
I want to listen, really listen, when she talks about her day, her worries, her dreams. I want to remember the little details that matter to her, like her favorite candle scent or the spot on her back that gets sore after a long day, and do quiet things to make her feel cared for.
I want to plan simple dates, drives to watch the sunset, picnics in the park, cozy movie nights with blankets and her favorite snacks, just because I love seeing her happy. I want to text her “good morning” every day and send a silly meme when I know she’s having a rough one.
I want the quiet comfort of knowing someone has my back, and knowing I have theirs. I want inside jokes, shared playlists, and the feeling of coming home to someone who’s genuinely glad I’m there.
I’m not chasing perfection or constant excitement, just the steady, caring kind of connection that grows from small moments. And I promise I’d give that same warmth, attention, and affection right back, every single day.
If you’re out there and you’ve ever felt this kind of loneliness too, I’m right here. I’d treat you like you’re the best part of my life, because you would be.

some days it honestly feels like all the context lives in my head by accident. i’m not the project historian, i’m not a mind reader and i’m definitely not supposed to be the person who remembers every decision someone casually agreed to and then immediately forgot. but somehow that’s exactly what ends up happening.

what gets me is everyone thinks we’re aligned because we were all in the same meeting. but then dev delivers something completely different from what design planned, ops is prepping for a version of the project i’ve never even heard of and leadership is out there pitching a direction we didn’t actually choose. and i’m in the middle trying to pull everything back into the same universe with duct tape, coffee, and whatever patience i have left.

being a PM sometimes feels less like managing a project and more like hunting down the exact moment everything drifted off-course while nobody noticed. i didn’t sign up to be the person constantly asking “ok but why are we doing this?” like some weird cross between a toddler and a detective… but here we are.

Whilst she was talking with me about this, she mentioned that she was going to hang out with some friends on Saturday, which, of course, turned out to be my friends that I had introduced her to earlier on in the relationship.

  
As you can imagine, I was taken aback, and I mentioned to her how, in addition to how weird this is, the same friend had made plans with me to go drinking and then have me sleep at his house this upcoming Friday night after I got done with work. However, he had messaged me last Tuesday, stating that he might be out of town this weekend, so it was up in the air. He never did get back to me, and I found out about my ex's plans with him and another mutual friend through her on Wednesday.

  
After I talked with my ex, I learned that he had reached out to her multiple times after I told him I had broken up with her. Already disgusting, as he had shown me little to no concern. I've known this guy for years, and we've shared some of our most vulnerable moments, so to see this behavior from him after my breakup was disheartening. Suddenly, he grew extremely distant and uncommunicative. He ignored both of my calls today, and when I confronted him in text due to his lack of communication, he essentially made up excuses for what happened.

  
He basically told me that he understood how I felt, but he was ""already in a relationship,"" so his intent ""wasn't that"" if that's ""what I was thinking."" If he were truly in a relationship currently, why was his girlfriend comfortable with him going out to buy my ex food? Seems highly fishy to me! In addition, what intentions? Why does he already know exactly what intentions, when I made no mention of anything? Also highly fishy!

  
He then basically just spewed some bullshit about how he cares about us both and is trying to maintain relationships with us both (CLEARLY lmao) and how the other mutual would be there too so it was okay or something, but it was honestly just a joke. I find it so genuinely crazy how fast some men switch up around their friends when they have a chance to get some action. Not to mention that I had told him I was blocking him before he responded, but forgot to, so essentially, he was arguing with a brick wall as I should've never gotten that message. I also had to uninvite him from my upcoming birthday get-together as a part of that text.

  
It's just so appalling that all this happened, because I genuinely thought so much better of this man. But he's just shown he's a no-good, sorry sack of shit with no morals or values. He can burn in hell.

  
Anyways, I felt like I'd be a fool to not give my ex another chance after being there with me through all that, and for canceling plans with them despite me telling her I didn't care what she did (I did care) and for being so patient with me through it all, because I was highly irritable with the whole situation. She's handled the whole breakup so maturely despite me breaking up with her, and has never once made it more difficult for us. I appreciate her so much, and I feel like she might be ready after the wake-up call that the breakup was. We agreed to start very slow again, just get coffee this weekend, and then she'd take me to see Avatar 3 for my birthday. Overall, I'm very thankful to her for telling me all that even though I broke up with her, and I just think we can manage to make it work this time.

*Where the Odds Are as Frosty as a Finnish Winter and the Drama Is Lightly Toasted*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game for the Ages

Let’s start with the cold, hard stats. FC Lausanne-Sport is the favorite here, with odds ranging from **1.91 (BetMGM)** to **2.05 (DraftKings)**, translating to an implied probability of **47.6% to 51.3%**. KuPS Kuopio, the Finnish underdogs, hover between **3.2 (Bovada)** and **3.6 (FanDuel)**, implying a **27.8% to 31.2%** chance. The draw? A tidy 26.3% to 28.9%, depending on who’s selling spreads.

The totals market is a lukewarm “meh,” with most books pricing the **Over/Under at 2.5-3.0 goals**. The Over is slightly more tempting (1.83-1.91), but don’t expect a fireworks show—this feels like a game where the scoreline could be settled by a single, perfectly timed snowball (more on that later).

### Digest the News: Injuries, or Why Finland’s Weather Is a Sport in Itself

Let’s unpack the “recent news” section, shall we?

* **KuPS Kuopio**: Their star striker, **Eero “The Ice Moose” Miettinen**, is “recovering from a snowball-induced ankle sprain” after a post-practice skirmish with the team’s physiotherapist. Rumors also swirl that their goalkeeper practices penalty saves by fending off reindeer during midnight hikes. (Note: This is 100% not true, but it sounds plausible in a land where people drink coffee like it’s a duty to the state.)
* **FC Lausanne-Sport**: Their top scorer, **Luis “The Human Swiss Army Knife” Garcia**, is “resting his juggling muscles” after a grueling performance at a local fair. Meanwhile, their defense is allege

1pjttq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/1pjttq6/mixed_emotions_about_my_alcoholic_mother_thinking/,"Mixed emotions about my alcoholic mother. Thinking about going no contact, but it's hard and complicated.","I am F25, my mother is 56. I live with my grandma, 86. My mother used to live with us too, but when my grandpa died, my grandma refused to let her come back home because she couldn't handle her episodes without grandpa's support. I think that's the best decision she ever made, although I know it was very hard for her.

Even when my mother lived with us, it was very on and off. She'd be home a month or a few weeks, then go on a bender with one of her boyfriends and we wouldn't see her or hear from her for weeks, sometimes months. Sometimes she would come home when she runs out of money, sometimes police would bring her home, sometimes we would get a late night phone call from emergency clinic that they're taking her to psychiatric hospital on detox becuse she was found lying in the streets, parks, even Church yard one time.

When she was at home she'd bring her men here. Some of them would be inappropriate with me as a child.

I don't blame my grandparents, they raised me and tried to protect me to the best of their abilities, but they were always juggling between me and my mother. They wanted to help her too, and that unfortunately left me vulnerable to some things. But I couldn't be more thankful to my grandma for raising me, being my actual mother figure, being the biggest constant in my life.

Now unfortunately, my grandma is older and she's starting to have some health issues. My mother is still drinking, although now living with her partner. She gets money from my grandma because she can't work. Her bf works, but those are all low paying, gig like jobs. My mother was in a car crash when I was 4 which left her left leg shorter and she gets some benefits. But they mostly live off of my grandma's dime. They come here weekly for their allowance. Her partner doesn't drink so my grandma gives him control of the finances, and he looks after my mother. My mother goes out and begs for money when she doesn't have any and wants to drink. Sometimes she steals, sometimes she manages to borrow but people who respected her enough to land her money are mostly gone from her life. So she mostly begs. Which is painful to think about.

 It's a sick situation really. She is sober for a few days or a week, and her partner goes out to do some work and she gets drunk instantly. And she never gets drunk a little, it's always to the point of passing out on the floor and being completely unable to do anything for herself. She's on psych meds which also plays a part. He often can't leave her alone to go to work because she'll pass out on the street or at home, she hurt herself multiple times but lately it's scary because they have like a fireplace heating and she can burn the house down when she's drink. So grandma basically pays my mother's bf to be her caretaker. 

My fiance lives with grandma and I too. He works shifts, a physically demanding job, sometimes 7 days a week. It's good paying job but exhausting. I work part time to have time to look after my grandma. We can live comfortably in terms of finances, but we have no time to run around town after my drunk mother. I also have guilt for living comfortably while my mother begs, but we give her for necessities, she begs because of alcohol. You can't give her money into her hands because she's spend everything on alcohol. 

She still manages to be sober sometimes, when she's under her partners' constant surveillance. My grandma gets hopeful easily and invites her to lunch or coffee at our place. I hang out with her a little but try to not get too attached. It's hard because when she's sober, she can be fun and smart and nice to talk to. Reminds me of rare moments from my childhood when we would hang out.

I feel like I have to cut her off, for my own good. At some point, grandma won't be here anymore and someone will need to take care of my mother. If her partner starts working, she'll be drunk non stop and police calls would start again, neighbors will call me to pick her up, emergency room will call me... If I want her partner to monitor her, I'll need to pay him to not work. But I want to have my life, I want to save up, I want to have a wedding, to have children. I don't want to be my mother's eternal caretaker. Is that selfish of me? I feel so guilty even thinking about it. I don't know if there's some home type situation for her in my country. I'll talk to grandma, thankfully I have enough time to think about it, but the future scares me. My mother being in my life feels like an invisible prison that limits me of just living. Everything is always about her, we're always worried, you can never leave her alone, etc... I just want not to think about her. But that feels awful and selfish, as I said.

We may have already moved a bit away from what a more traditional Visual Novel would be, but the infinite possibilities that Ren'Py offers are amazing if you forget for a second what a Visual Novel is and simply design the game as you think it would look best.

Anyway, I hope you like our next title, and considering that we've ventured into more complex territory than we've done before, I hope you can give us some help in the future, as we'll surely need it for any technical complications that may arise!",4,1765446884.0,RenPy,0,1.0,False

If you're grinding away at a dead-end job like I was 6 months ago, dreaming of passive income but drowning in $60/month Midjourney subs and sketchy ""AI courses,"" this is your wake-up call.Picture this: A stunning Latina AI girl named Luna Reyes, posting bikini beach walks and gym mirror selfies that rack up 500k–5M views per Reel. No camera. No models. No budget. Just me, my laptop, and Google's hidden gem: Nano Banana (their unlimited free image gen tool via Whisk/Gemini).

I built her from scratch – locked her face with a single seed number, spiced her with freckles and signature poses, animated her into lip-syncing TikToks with Pika Labs (also free), and launched her on IG/TikTok. Week 1: 12k followers. Month 1: $8k from Fansly subs and affiliate links. Now? She's autopilot with a $3/hour VA, and I'm scaling to 3 more ""sister"" girls.

Sound too good? It is good – but only if you execute. That's why I poured every hack, prompt, and backup plan into Nano Banana Harvest Cookbook: AI Influencer Creation for Free. It's not some fluffy PDF – it's the A-to-Z playbook:

Plant the Seed: Exact 5-line prompts for photoreal characters that never break consistency (like Luna's hazel eyes and hourglass vibe).

Spice It Up: 120+ copy-paste poses (safe for Nano Banana, viral AF for Reels) – from coffee shop smirks to private-jet struts.

Go Viral: 30-day checklist to 100k followers, collab DM templates (80% yes rate), and ""if Week 1 flops"" rescue ops (engagement pods + Reddit funnels).

Cash In: Fansly/Fanvue blueprints ($10k–$100k/month stacks), digital product swipes, and full automation for 5–10 girls on <2 hours/week.

Bonuses: Character Bible template, 20 mega-viral Reel poses (1M–20M views each), Pika animation guide, and Whisk mastery (bypass those pesky blocks like a pro).

I tested every step on Luna – no paid tools, no fluff. If a total newbie like me (ex-retail drone) can hit 6-figures, you can too. The harvest is ripe, but the tools are free... forever.

Grab it here before I bump the price: Nano Banana Harvest Cookbook – $47 (or $37 early-bird for the next 72 hours).

Who's planting their first seed tonight? Drop your niche below (fitness queen? Travel vixen?) – I'll reply with a custom prompt to kickstart you.

What should I do?","If you are a hot guy, please tell me I am not delusional, as I honestly think something has changed about me, but I think I just do not really notice, feel free to make fun of me if I am  wrong.

`After living here for 4 years, it finally bothered me a lot so I decided to just do MORE, so more running, more exercise, less eating and generally MORE depressed. I realised I lost 16 kgs in 3 months of time, I stand at 76KG atm I guess.`

After all this, a couple of months ago, I took a trip out of Germany for a few weeks, and I started to have these random, strange encounters with women. Meaning, having chats in coffee stores, a random lady will start chatting and want to make videos of eating things together and asking my plans for the day/week in this city OR just to know me, another lady stared at me too long and just said ""WOW"" in under her breath when I was in a subway, and I was like ""what is happening, maybe people are just nice here"".

And then I came back to Berlin, and the pattern kept repeating, and I still found it strange, like, why are people looking at me?????. I was sitting and waiting for my coffee, and there was this one girl who just left her entire friend group, and we kept on staring at each other, and she got her coffee and left with a disappointed(German??) face and one last look.

Similarly, in the Sbhan, it's always women who will give me a big smile and offer an empty seat and keep on shooting eyes while I sit awkwardly, checking my calculator app. Girls looking back before getting of the train, before the door closes. AND IT JUST KEEPS HAPPENING MOST OF THE TIME.

1pjtk6p,https://i.redd.it/q31eddyopj6g1.png,Took the plunge with an AMBULANCE,"The wife and I bought an ambulance, and we've got about one month to get it ready to live in before we move to another country and live in it for several months! 

It's a 2008 Mercedes Sprinter Diesel automatic with 163,000 km. We bought it from Germany and drove it home in 1½ days.

It's got a built-in 12V system with 100ah battery and inverter. It must also have an AC-12VDC charger somewhere because it has an external shore power connection using a specialized emergency vehicle AV connector (which I plan to either get an adapter for or replace with a standard connection).

I'm planning to change the electrical to 24V and getting 400W of solar. I considered keeping 12V and just replacing the battery and adding an MPPT, but probably the equipment is all fairly old and due for replacement anyway. Hopefully I can re-purpose some existing wiring though. I plan to buy a Victron EasySolar II to handle shore power charging, inverter, and MPPT duties, and a 12-24V DC-DC non-isolated charger to charge from the alternator.

For heating, we plan to install a wood-burning stove. We would also like to be able to use this for some cooking and also to heat some water for soup or tea.

We plan to buy a portable composting toilet, as well as a diesel heater for emergency backup. Appliance we plan on running are a projector (AC), coffee maker/kettle (24V), air fryer (24V), and some kind of air conditioner in the future (either mini split or portable 220VAC we already own). Also a fridge/freezer (probably Dometic 24V).

We will buy a lifepo4 battery with monitor built locally (25.6V from 8x3.2V cells with frame) for about €850.

We also will need to get a faucet for the existing sink, water tanks, and some solution for shower (ideally with hot water). For our bed, plan to build a frame that can be lowered and raised for our current 180x200cm mattress.

Doctors gave me epi pen and steroids and antihistamines which caused heart problems and horrendous anxiety and paranoia. One time after taking prednisolone (steroid) I had this acid rush in my throat, couldn't breath, coughed so much, felt like vomiting and doctors in the UK haven't been able to diagnose me properly, each one of them told me something different (seen like 5 of them between GPs and Hospital and one told me is anxiety another one unmanaged asthma even though I clearly could see that it wasn't asthma - with all due respect I've had asthma since age 4 every day and this was very different, from age 18 until now I rarely had asthma attacks only if I got in contact with something I'm allergic to like grass, another one said is a virus, another one potentially cancer and so on). I went abroad and the doctors there diagnosed me with severe posterior laryngitis caused by GERD and obstinate constipation. These past three months I have been very ill with symptoms like something stuck in my throat, horrendous throat pain, chest pains as if I was getting a heart attack, shortness of breath, swollen painful lymph nodes, horrendous leg pains, headaches, anxiety, unable to swallow anything solid sometimes even liquids, abdominal pain, constant dryness in my mouth, constant postnasal drip and severe constipation to the point that I had to do several enemas whilst eating only mashed almost liquid fruits and vegetables. The specialist told me to change diet and take a licorice supplement after meals (he didn't prescribe ppi or anti acids) and gave me 40 days to get better if that doesn't happen I have to be seen by another specialist that will check all the way down the stomach not just nose and throat like the ENT suggested. In the past year on top of the other colds and allergy like symptoms including CONSTANT post nasal drip I've had chest pains and throat pains which I thought were anxiety and stress related. At the moment my intestine and stomach are better but my throat hurts a lot, lymphnodes are still swollen, can't swallow anything and I've lost 10kg already (I weighed 58kg before being Ill and I weigh 48kg now - I'm 24(F) 5ft tall so I'm still at a normal weight for my height). I'm trusting the ENT that visited me and trying to be patient but sometimes I feel like I'll never go back to being able to eat normally (I'm okay with stop eating some foods even though I love them like tomato, chilli flakes and coffee, I just want to be able to feel like my throat is painfree and be able to swallow solid foods like a normal human and not have my lymphnodes the size of a lemon - mind you the ENT said that lymphnodes are like that for two reasons: extra production of mucus to protect the throat and trying to heal the tissues in my throat that are completely consumed by the acids. Also I have NEVER had classic symptoms like heartburn after eating so I didn't know I had silent reflux for like a year which then became severe GERD). Anyone who's overcome this, could you please advise what did you do and if changes are long term? I need some useful information and advise and reassurance. Thank you for all your time and support.

I have this fantasy of going into a coffee shop and ordering a bunch of things to be served to me throughout the day. Something like ""4 cups of coffee and two cakes and a sandwhich"", to be served to me periodically while I chill in the coffee shop the entire day working on my art or reading or otherwise just relaxing by myself. Perhaps they serve me every 2 hours or something, or when they see that my cup is empty just giving me a refill. I'd be happy to square the bill in advance. 

But while this fantasy is super appealing to me as a kind of mini holiday/self-indulgent treat, I can't help but feel like it's too much to ask the service workers. I get the feeling they don't want me taking up space and hurting their turnover, and they don't want to have to remember an order I made four hours ago! It feels like too much to ask! But at the same time, I know it would probably be fine if I were to just get up and order another coffee every hour and a half. 

What do you guys think? Could I make this fantasy a reality or am I asking too much?

Please be kind. I have worked in customer service. I know what it's like to have entitled asshole customers. This is only a fantasy and I'm content leaving it as a fantasy and I wouldn't be anything other than grateful and gracious to anyone serving me in any context. I understand the work is hard and demoralising and sometimes humiliating. This is just an idea I'm floating, not an indication that I want to sadistically torment coffee shop staff.

We've been together for 7yr, and I really don't want it to be something too useless or boring. So I've been torn between practical and romantic things.  
On one hand, I'm leaning towards something practical, like a good coffee machine (we’re both coffee lovers!) or maybe a robot vacuum to help with cleaning since recently I found the ecovacs X11 seems perfect for our place. These are things we’d actually use every day, so they feel more useful. On the other hand, I’m kind of tempted to go for something more romantic, like custom jewelry or making a scrapbook with all our memories. These kinds of gifts are great for creating those “wow” moments and emotional connections. But I’m stuck, will a practical gift feel too unromantic? And if I go for something purely romantic, will it end up feeling pointless after a while?  
What did you end up choosing for the people around you this year? I’d love any advice or tips you give.",3,1765445042.0,GiftIdeas,4,1.0,False

I have no formal running background except for some cross-country races in middle school, but I have always been involved in sports at a non-competitive level. After high school, I started lifting weights, but in recent years, I have had less time for that due to work.

In May, I began running consistently and signed up for my first marathon. I followed the Hal Higdon novice 1 plan with some modifications: the two shortest runs of the week were easy, the third run was either tempo or intervals (4-6x1km once a month), I did leg day at the gym on Saturdays, and I did a long run on Sundays, initially at a pace of 5:40/50 min/km and later at 5:30/40 min/km. In August, I missed two weeks of training due to travel, but I resumed without any major issues.

I ran two half marathons in September and October, with times of 1:48 and 1:47, respectively. In the last week of October, I peaked at 70 km and then tapered aggressively because my legs were sore. On the Tuesday before the marathon, I ran a 1500m in 5:04, feeling like I had more in the tank as my heart rate peaked at 184 (my max heart rate is 195-200). On November 23rd, I completed the marathon in 3:48:xx (first half: 1:55:xx, second half: 1:52:xx). The race went well, with my heart rate always under control thanks to the ideal weather conditions (0-5°C), although my legs felt tired and heavy during the last ~10km.

I have already signed up for a half marathon in April and I am aiming for a sub-1:37 time. I plan to start the Pfitz 12/55 plan in January, but I am concerned about my muscle recovery, which seems slow despite my young age, good sleep habits, and a healthy lifestyle (no partying, drinking, or late-afternoon coffee) the not so good about my lifestyle is my office job (i spend quite a long time sitting). My muscle recovery is bad especially  if compared to ~5 years ago when i was lifting 5/6 days a week +  playing some pickup basketball. Any suggestion on how to approach this training block?

We had a fun conversation at a music festival, exchanged numbers and texted randomly for a bit before trailing off.

She texted me a few years later, but I was in a relationship so just sent one hello text back and that was it.

A few months after my ex and I broke up this year, I thought about her and texted her out of the blue. I asked her if she wanted to meet up but she was about to travel for several months. We planned to meet sometime around the holidays at the end of this year.

She continued to initiate texts while she was away. When she got back I suggested a FaceTime since we’d been texting for months with no real set time to meet. She wasn’t comfortable with FaceTime and asked to do a phone call instead. On the call we ended up talking for 3 hours, and she asked a lot of intense personal questions, things about life goals, what went wrong in past relationships, family dynamics etc. A little intense for me, having only ever met once 6 years ago, but it was a good call overall. A few minutes after the call she texted me more follow up questions about relationship type stuff. Then the next day asked me rapid fire all sorts of things about what it would be like to date me.

I totally understand wanting to know a lot of info before dating someone. But for me, the most natural sequence feels like chat for a bit, meet up in person to see if there’s any real chemistry there, and then go from there and learn about each other as we go, allowing things to unfold organically.

We haven’t seen each other’s faces in 6 years truly have no idea if we’d even hit it off again in person. The texts today started feeling really unnatural, like trying to run through every potential pitfall and what an entire relationship would be like before even doing something as basic as grabbing a coffee in person. My last relationship started out similarly out of sync imo and it ended up being a huge red flag. I’m feeling like our styles of how to approach a relationship are so different that I don’t really want to meet anymore. WIBTAH for bailing on this whole thing after months of texting?

TL;DR - After months of texting with a woman  I met once 6 years ago, we have a plan to meet for a first date soon.

1pjt7dg,https://i.redd.it/yun7zxlglj6g1.jpeg,Chapter 4 of my story 💚,"I know my story doesnt get alot of attention here but I still enjoy sharing it ☺️
Story down here:
It's 8:00 AM and breakfast, and Anthony is sat downstairs at the kitchen table with his mom and twin brother Terrance.
Anthony is thinking about that dream he had last night about Craig. He only told his mom he liked him just a little bit, but now...it seems alot more. And he barely knows him but he feels so attached already.

""Honey..."" 

Anthony looks up from his bowl of cereal and his eyes face his mother. But it's ok, since he feels comfortable looking at Harriet.

""Are you going to eat your cereal?""

Anthony sighs and looks back down, stirring the spoon in the bowl, trying to process the complex emotions hes experiencing. He has never liked a man this much in his life.

""You ok, Ant?"" His brother asked.

Anthony converts his thoughts into a small frown.

""Um..."" He mutters.

""Mama...""

Harriet looks over at him with a concerned expression.

""I had a dream about Craig last night... and I kissed him."" Anthony says reluctantly.

""Theres not a thing wrong with that, honey."" Harriet said, reassuringly.

""Yeah, we already know you're gay and stuff."" Terrance chimed in.

""...And you have a crush on him, so it's ok."" Harriet says, attempting to make Terrances response less awkward.

Anthony shyly smiles, feeling a tad bit less nervous about it. But still, he wonders, and he lifts his spoon to take a bite.

He takes a glimpse of his reflection in the milk halfway through chewing and notices his hair is almost touching it, and he brushes it out the way. Kind of like... what happened at the cafe. He gets lost in thought about his interaction with him, but still eats. This cereal is good, almost as good as the memory. He finishes everything, and sits up. He walks over to the door, and before he opens it, his mother says across the room, ""Call me if you need anything, I hope it goes well!""

Anthony looks behind his shoulder and smiles, walking out.

He meets Craig at the exact same trail again. As hes approaching him, he is twirling his curls, tugging on his clothes, and the like, and its clear he is fidgeting. He feels excited to see him.

Craig does a small wave at him, and Anthony automatically smiles, but he tries to hide it, blushing.

""Hey,"" Anthony looks up at him, ""Do... do you want to go to the cafe again, by the way?""

The corners of Anthony's mouth turns up as he processes what Craig says.

""Yeah...!"" He looks at him in the eyes a little.

They order lattes like last time, since thats Anthonys favorite.

""Hey, by the way, I wanted to talk to you yesterday but I was busy."" Craig said.

""Busy with what?"" Anthony asked, positively curious.

""Oh, you know, helping my family out with stuff. Mowing the lawn, taking out the trash. Paying the bills. You know, man stuff, for a 19 year old man."" A bead of sweat subtly forms on his forehead at the incredulous response.

""Oh, um. That's fine."" Anthony taps his fingers quietly on the coffee cup.

""Are lattes your favorite, too?"" He says, looking back up at him.

Craig tries to think of a response.

""Im sorry, that was probably boring."" Anthony looks to the side, frowning.

""Oh no, it's just..."" 

Anthony looks at him again, waiting for a response. Craig looks at him and captures a glimpse of his whole entire face. He is enraptured by his beauty and he tries not to make it obvious by averting his gaze slightly.

""Craig?"" 

""My favorite is a macchiato."" Craig looks back down at the table.

""Oh really? Thats my least favorite. It kind of tastes like an espresso to me, it's too bitter."" He giggles.

""Eh, I didn't say you had to like it."" Craig smirks.

""Hey... um, by the way. Can I tell you something?"" Anthony asked.

""What is it?""

""I saw someone on tv last night that looked like you. I think his name was... Handsome Robert. Or, um, Robert.""

""Oh, is he from The Lucky Ones? I watch that! My dad compares me to him all the time. Though, hes alot more skinnier than me, and probably alot more handsomer. I dont know, could Handsome Craig apply to me?""

""Maybe."" Anthony shyly says.

Craig's eyes widen as a subtle blush forms on his cheeks. ""Oh..."" 

""Thanks."" 

Anthony giggles, smiling at him.

""We should come here more, Craig.""

""Yeah, we should. I like drinking coffee with someone like you. You're cool.""

Anthony blushes, kind of thrown off by that comment.

""Is... is he flirting with me?"" He thought.

""Is there something wrong?"" 

""No, I'm fine! Its just I'm heating up a little.""

""Is it really that hot in here?"" He looks around, tugging at his collar.

""Nope, it's just like that for me."" Anthony nervously laughs.

Anthony sits up and awkwardly waddles over to the trash can to throw away his drink. He lets out a sigh.

Craig walks over to him and also throws away his coffee and briefly makes eye contact with him, both becoming shy. 

""Do you need anything?"" Craig asked.

""What do you mean?""

""If... you're feeling overwhelmed by anything, because you seem more overwhelmed than you're burning up.""

""Nope, don't worry about me."" Anthony smiles a little.

""Will we meet here again tomorrow?""

""Yeah!"" He says, quietly excited.

""Maybe we should try some new drinks, like the pumpkin spice.""

""Oh, sure. I just drink lattes each time because I feel more comfortable that way. I just love the same thing over and over.""

""See you tomorrow."" Anthony says, waving at him a little.

""See you tomorrow."" Craig says, almost repeating him but in a more reserved way.

1pjt4zm,https://i.redd.it/84uai2smkj6g1.jpeg,pH Differences in Tea Preferences,"Hey all,

A little while ago I was in a lively discussion in a different sub over whether teeth should be brushed before or after breakfast in the mornings. I was team After Breakfast because tea stains on teeth. Reddit being reddit, a debate ensued. Their argument was that you shouldn't brush your teeth immediately after tea or coffee because of acidity. My counter argument was that milk would reduce the pH making it safe to brush teeth, which...wasn't enough. 

I didn't have enough evidence to back my claim up, and it inevitably got to the point where people got weirdly personal, so the argument was left at me being irresponsible for brushing my teeth after drinking tea - even with milk (lol). 

Had we been arguing about whether to brush teeth before or after drinking energy drinks or sodas, yes, I'd absolutely see where they were coming from, but tea with milk being so acidic didn't seem right. 

Me being the citizen scientist and curious person I am, I recently bought pH test strips for no real reason. As I was making my cup of tea, I was reminded of this debate, and decided to test the hypothesis that milk lowers pH in tea.

As pictured, I took 3 test samples. 1 with water from the tap (filtered, because why not), another with black tea that I had brewed up for 2 minutes or so (not exact), and the same tea when I added milk. 

As you can see, the black tea and water were pretty similar. I did say 4-5 on the black tea one because there were tiny hints of a different colour leaning towards 4, but very subtle differences. 
Milk made the biggest change, I was very confident with the pH of 6 during evaluation.

**Discussion**
Now, the existing pH of our water was a little concerning. I have no idea what would cause our tap water to have a pH between 5-6. 

The findings do support the original hypothesis that milk lowers the pH of tea. It is likely this also applies to coffee as well, however I cannot be bothered right now to look up research on it (lol). 
It is not known whether concentrations or ratios of tea:milk:water would have impacted the results, so more research is needed. 

The experiment findings do not support brushing teeth after consuming energy drinks or other highly food or drink high in citric acid. It is well known that the citric acid can soften teeth enamel, and if brushed soon after consumption, can lead to dental problems. 
A study investigating milk mouth swishes after consuming energy drinks may be intriguing to know the findings.

1pjt4tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1pjt4tw/she_died/,She died.,"My mother- who has suffered with alcoholism and drug abuse for most of my life- died from chronic alcoholism. 

I work in healthcare. Part of my job involves MTPs. (Massive transfusion protocol). More than a few times I've seen people in their 50s-60s get admitted to the hospital for GI bleeds and esophageal varices due to their extensive history of alcoholism. These bleeds are often quick and half the time the patient dies. 

Less than a month ago I remember thinking to myself that I should call my mom and tell her to slow down. That this could happen. She has never taken my previous warnings seriously. It slipped my mind as soon as I had thought it. 

A week later, I missed multiple phone calls from my brother and father. I immediately knew. I had been feeling off all day and I couldn't shake it. I needed confirmation, my father reluctant to tell me said, ""Your mother passed away"". 

Shock flooded my body and the level of grief I felt shocked me even more. I thought I had always mentally prepared for her death but in reality, it was what I feared the most. 

A few days later I spoke with the medical examiner. I had my suspicions that my mother most likely died from a GI bleed or esophgeal varices. He stated that she had vomited a lot of blood and fell unconscious. Someone she knew had started CPR until the ambulance came. They worked on her for over 2 hours before calling it. He told me that given her medical history coupled with the fact that she vomited a lot of blood, he suspected a GI bleed. 

I could picture it. All of it. Flashes of my mother on all fours on her blue epoxy flooring, vomiting up a substance that resembled coffee grounds, only for her to then collapse. I could see someone doing CPR, cracking her ribs, her body limp: only moving from the pulses of CPR. I could see the rush of the ER hovering and working around her, pumping her with blood, pushing epinephrine. I could see the exhaustion of what feels like failure as the medial team is told to stop and the doctor declares time of death. 

I picture all of this while speaking to the medical examiner. Asking him questions that I know he is surprised to hear, realizing that I understand more than most. 

Ever since she passed, a part of me feels like it's missing. Life feels a little more emptier now. I'm so angry at her. I'm angry at her for dying. I'm angry for always being right. I'm angry at the people who enabled her, who were also addicts who didn't care if she lived or died. They just wanted to live in her house and take advantage of her. I'm angry that the little stread of hope I had of   my mother getting clean, died with her that day. I'm angry that no matter how hard I tried to bury, deny or destroy that hope: it was always there. I'm angry that at the end of the day, I'm still that little girl who wanted nothing other than to see her mom get better.

It was dark for a while... and the fun shall continue.



I was texting her last night and I was behaving a little hyperactive. I guess I had coffee which perked me up and I said it's good to be high energy. I have family members who work in cubicles and had or have sedentary jobs. They have to sit a lot. If it were me, I'd be ready to tear my hair out. I'm too hyper.



I said, there's nothing wrong with office work. I'm just hyperactive and ADHD. I remember when I was pursuing accounting in college. You need to be patient and organized. It's a good career, but it's not for me because I'm too manic and scatterbrained.



Somebody asked, about my mother and stepfather, are they hyperactive like you?



I said, ""Yes, they are. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I think my mother and stepfather need mood stabilizing medications, but they have no problem telling me I need to take my meds.""



Somebody asks, ""Are your mother and father intense?""



I said, ""My father is lazy, but my mother is very intense and hyperactive. And my stepfather, he's very intense. Obviously, it was probably his military training, it's his military background.""



I said, ""my father, Papi, Robert Koloski, he's quite lazy, though, unfortunately. I love him, but I would often get frustrated when I was 18 years old. He'd want to sit on the couch while I wanted to run around. But it's okay, though.""



They say opposites attract, but you also need things in common.



And my grandmother on my mother's side of the family was very hyperactive. My grandfather used to say, ""There it goes."" She swam at a pool every day until a very old age. I guess her hyperactivity got passed down to my mother, then the lineage got passed down to me.



Somebody noticed that when I'm in a room full of people, I'm very shy.



I said, ""Yeah, it's true. I'm more comfortable interacting with people ""one on one"" than a whole room of people.""



I asked her, ""Do you think I'm hyperactive? Maybe I'm just more comfortable with one or so individuals.""



Also, something that I wanted to indicate is... obviously, I'm very excited to be meeting new friends. But they are still new friends. They don't know me that well yet. And I'm very excited and hyperactive... I'm really enjoying chatting with them and I'm really enjoying being their friends.



But remember to give them space, to give them boundaries. Don't be overbearing because that typically scares people away. You don't want to be enmeshed with people.



I said, ""if I'm too hyperactive with my texts or I'm behaving too excited to be your friend, I'm sorry. I apologize. I'll chill out. To be honest, in my 20s and 30s, I haven't had many friends, and I'm really excited to be meeting friends. So I'll just calm down. Give you space... but I'm really appreciative of the friendships.""

Hello everyone,

I (40F) don't even know what I expect to get from this, but I do feel very alone as of late. My husband left me 2 months ago, and I am finding out that who I thought were my friends are not.

I have tried joining local groups and even apps like BeFriend or Wink, but nothing is working. I don't understand what's wrong with me or why I cannot make new friends, but I am lonely, and I have no one to talk to... I also have no direct family support, as I live in the UK, but all my family is in Spain. I just need people to have conversations that go a bit deeper than the weather or what you've done at the weekend.

I usually like to read, I do several types of crafts, I like video games and board games, and I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows. However, life has been very dull, and I have not been doing much of anything. Also, I'm pretty sure I'm AuDHD. No formal diagnosis, but the signs are there.

If you would like to connect or think we may have something in common, please reach out and let's talk. I am based in the Hampshire area, so if you are local, I am also happy to meet for a chat and a coffee or a walk.",0,1765443298.0,Needafriend,4,0.25,False

Like a LOT of making out. We go to different schools and were hanging out a lot over the summer for the first time in years. That summer was very eventful and at some point before the kiss had realized we both liked eachother at the same time but it had passed. When i'm drunk, i'm not gonna lie all i want to do is kiss someone and so does she so naturally the idea was already in my mind. Maybe it's just cause im single and alone, lol, but that's how it goes. 
     Anyway, I went on a trip and when I got back let's just say that feeling had been turned up. A week or so later was the party and I had way too much to drink and that's when it happened. Not getting to deep into all those details but all we did was make out and we ended up moving outside for more privacy. 
     So weeks went by without us even talking about it, though we had hung out a few times, until i had a small kickback at my house while my mom was away. Again, more drinking, and we ended up cuddling all night and lots of flirting but not much more. During all of this, while sober (most of the time ik it sounds bad in this 😭) I was very unsure about it all and didn't know how to feel. I felt guilty for not talking to her about it but i am very non confrontational and have anxiety about this and really didn't want to lose a friend. So after that night at my house, she wanted to hang out so we grabbed coffee and walked around a shopping center while i tried to make it as platonic as possible.
     We had hung out a few times after this blah blah blah and maybe a month or so ago we had finally become plainly friends again.
     Then we got drunk again. It was the day after thanksgiving and we were hanging out with friends that were visiting so it was a special occasion. It was great, I felt a bit past tipsy at most, and made it home safe, no kissing happened. Success!! Now I really don't know how but once i was home it hit me like a freight train. I was VERY intoxicated and called and texted many people, including this girl. I poured my heart out, crying a bit, about how unsure i felt about it all and how evil I felt for leading her on. 
      I talked about wanting to kiss her and liking her and how bad i felt for saying that, blah blah blah. I talked about my struggles with romance and why i thought it was hard for me (mostly my parent's divorce while i was very young, giving me a very weird relationship with love/romantic affection) and some other things. 

I just want to know what steps i should take moving forward? my friends suggested to stop talking to her and let the friendship die.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Houston Rockets vs. Los Angeles Clippers: A Tale of Two Tankers**  
*December 12, 2025*

The NBA’s version of a ""Battle of the Bubbles"" kicks off as the Houston Rockets (-9.5) host the Los Angeles Clippers, two teams so deeply entrenched in the Western Conference basement they might as well be competing in the *League of Ordinary Men*. But hey, at least someone’s got to make the losing interesting!

**Parsing the Odds: Why the Rockets Are Favored Over a Team Named After Sea Creatures**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The Rockets are listed at **-800** implied probability (decimal 1.25) per the odds, while the Clippers hover around **+400** (24.4%). That’s like betting on a tortoise to lose a race against a snail—except the snail here is wearing a cast. The spread of -9.5 for Houston suggests bookmakers think this game could be a laugher, though “laugher” is a relative term when both teams shoot like they’re playing in a sandstorm.

Houston’s 9-16 record (.360) edges out LA’s 6-18 (.250), but context is key. The Rockets have clawed out close losses recently, like a drama queen without a script. The Clippers? They’re the NBA’s version of a “404 Error”—present, but functionally useless. Their 6-18 mark isn’t just bad; it’s *poetic* in its despair.

**News Digest: Injuries, Roster Drama, and Why the Clippers Should’ve Stayed in Brooklyn**  
Houston’s biggest “news” is that they’ve avoided catastrophic injuries… so far. Their star guard, Tyrese Maxey (assuming he’s still there in 2025), has averaged 22 PPG on a diet of coffee and sheer will. Meanwhile, the Clippers are a medical marvel. Their starting five has combined for **14 injuries this season**, including a “mysterious” benching of their center for “emotional exhaustion” after watching too many of his teammates miss free throws.

As soon as the doors open, they quietly take their familiar seats — well-groomed, neatly dressed, carrying that calm dignity that comes only with age.

In front of them is a small cup of strong coffee and a glass of cold water. Nothing more. The elderly people talk unhurriedly: they discuss neighbors, health, family, the news, the prices at the market. Sometimes they recall the past, sometimes they argue about politics or football, and sometimes they simply sit in silence — because here, silence is also a conversation.

For these elderly people, such morning meetings are almost a ritual. They can sit for hours, enjoying the start of the day, the sunlight, and each other’s company. And there is something incredibly warm in this: watching life flow gently, and seeing how small habits make each day feel just right.

I'm not sure how to get strong espresso out of the Brera we bought a few weeks ago. 

I've set the grinder to the finest setting but even at the highest strength setting (three bean symbols) the espresso is really weak. 

So far I have only tried [these Lavazza beans](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B000VJ8NEU). Perhaps not the best kind, but they're listed as strength 8 of 10 so I would have expected at least some oomph. But no. 

Would really like to hear from other Brera users about what can be done.

The shaking was becoming more horrendous to endure by the second. In defiance I still kept my eyes closed, desperate to try and block as many of my senses to the noise as I conceivably could. Slowly, surely, and eventually. The shaking of the shuttle died down into something far, far more manageable. It now actually felt more like traditional flight turbulence as opposed to, well, whatever that was back there.

Slowly, I began to open my eyes, when I did, I was greeted with a serene view of space. For a moment I could forget the carnage that was happening on the planet behind us and allow my mind to enjoy the serenity of the silence for a moment.

“You okay?” Sovlin asked.

I softly nodded to him in response, gazing back out of the shuttle window to the planet below. There were more ships now, not arxur ones thankfully. It seems that the Federation had finally responded to the situation, bringing with them a contingent of ships nearly double that of the arxur’s. I watched from afar as they rapidly entered the planet’s atmosphere, engaging the ramshackle vessels of the arxur all the way. I simply stared at the raging battle while our ship progressed further and further away,  before I knew it, I could see the whole planet from my seat, and it was slowly getting smaller with every passing second.

Eventually, it had become a speck on the horizon after almost 10 minutes of traveling straight into the blackness. I couldn’t even tell if there was a battle raging across it any more. I fell back into my seat, my want to view the outside diminished for now, I decided it be best if I get comfortable sitting in this seat, it would be a while before we could get to Aafa, even with an FTL capable ship.

But just as I did, as soft blaring of an indicator came from the cockpit, not one of alarm, but of indication that something was just here, something friendly.

“Sounds like we’re here.” Said the male human clad in blue, who turned his head back to the cockpit in question.

“Send it out Galv. We’re ready to leave system.” They said to whoever was piloting the vessel.

“At once sire.” Came a response, along with the faint click of buttons and levers.

“Umm, what’s going on exactly?” I asked, the human looked back with a smirk.

“We’re at our real destination.” He said. I looked out to space once more, only to see the vast void before me.

“Where is it?” I asked, earning a chuckle.

“Right in front of you. Can’t you see it?” The human said, i looked at him with a clearly concerned expression, unable to ascertain what he meant. I looked out again, and as expected there was nothing.

“No.” I stated back to them.

“Good, that means the cloak is still working, which means the corvette is doing its job correctly.”

Before I could inquire further, a sharp shimmer arched across the windows, casting light throughout the ship. My eyes were drawn towards it, and I stood in utter shock at the sight above me. Floating right above us was a massive ship, that easily had to be at least 10 times the size of this basic shuttle, if not more. Somehow, the massive vessel had stood there completely undetected this entire time. How is that possible!?? How do you hide something that big?

I fell back in my seat, look to the others in astonishment. Sovlin merely looked at me with face that told me he was internally asking ‘First time?’ As if the sight before him was a common one, the adjacent human looked out of his window with a smirk.

“There she is.” He said casually, before turning back to me.

“Our ticket out of system.”

The shuttle began to climb towards the ship above it, an underslung door began to open, and bled light out beckoning us towards it. As we approached it, I noticed a claw descend from the hangar bay, its four digits opened in preparation for our approach.

When we we full beneath it, the claw struck firmly, grappling onto the shuttle with what felt like exceedingly powerful magnets. The shuttle’s engines then came to a stop, and we were raised into the massive vessel proper.

The hanger we were pulled into was a decently sized area, big enough to easily fit a dozen shuttles, but from the size of the craft that I could see within, its clear vessels of our size were not a typical priority. The ones I did see were more heavily armed and armored than our shuttle could ever hope to be.

The shuttle impacted the floor of the hanger with a loud thud, which shook all of us a tad, but from the look on the humans faces i could tell it was standard procedure for them. A voice came from the cockpit, likely the one in charge of the manning the claw stating how we were clear to leave the now landed shuttle.

“See, that wasn’t too bad right?” The male human said looking to me, I absentmindedly scratched the back of my head in contemplation.

“I guess so, my thanks to the pilot for that.” I said, and just as I did the door to the shuttle’s cockpit opened, revealing that aforementioned pilot. When I saw him though, I found myself utterly surprised by the figure now standing before me.

It wasn’t a human, matter of fact, it wasn’t a species I’d ever seen before. Unless there was an undocumented subspecies of gojids with green skin and plates instead of spines, but those chances were so astronomically low they bordered on idiotic.

“Nice flying back there Galv.” The male human stated to the strange sapient before me, his eyes slightly listed over to them, before giving a pronounced bow towards them.

“I live to serve, sire.” They said in a tone that bled with strange sense of nobility and purpose, before quickly rising and heading for the exit hatch of the shuttle which they creaked open bit by bit.

“Surprised?” The blue armored human said to me with a curious expression.

“Very much so.” I stated, pointing to the pilot as he strode outside of the shuttle

“Who- what- who is that? And what are they?”

“He’s a Krev, you can ask him his name later. Don’t worry if you’ve never heard the name before, they’ve kept it that way.” The human said back, only invoking the spawn of more questions rather than answers.

“H-How?” I asked, the human opened his mouth, only for the accompanying one in red to nudge against his shoulder, gesturing to the exit of the shuttle before quickly departing. The blue human watched as they left before looking back to me.

“Tell you what, when we seat ourselves somewhere more comfortable, I’ll answer that for ya.” With that, the human rose from his chair, stretching and popping a few of his bones as he did. The seat was likely very uncomfortable for them, give their general size in comparison to its intended occupants. He turned away from us and left down the passage the female had, descending down a set of stair and into the hanger bay.

I looked to Sovlin, who had already risen from his seat, a hand outstretched to coax me out towards him. I grabbed it, rising from my seat with my pack of items in tow.

""You never told me about other new aliens Sovlin."" I said, the gojid responded with a tiny shrug in response before turning to the exit of the shuttle.

""The existence of a new race of predators was all you wanted to hear about, right?"" Sovlin said while walking out, myself following lightly behind.

""True. But I would have liked to know all the details."" I said following him out of the shuttle.

""I'll remember for next time."" He stated simply.

An announcement then came from the massive ship's speakers, telling us that we would begin 'gating' out of system in a few moments. It dawned on me quite quickly that this terminology was what humans used to refer to FTL travel.

Again, my mind buzzed with more questions that yearned for answers. So I tried my best to keep up with Sovlin, the two humans, and the Krev. I'd certainly get my chance to ask them after all. What else was there to do until we reached Aafa?

“Exodus.”

That singular word had become the spark of a whole new line of investigation. The evidence of multiple spacefaring species utilizing our technologies was already more than we had expected to encounter here, and now to find evidence of another, that even the residents of the planet were unaware of the existence of. To put it in layman's terms, its existence caused quite a ruckus for our division.

As such we were immediately put to work trying to decipher what we could about this apparent forgotten civilization of Venlil. If there were concerns fellow colleagues had or theories to be made about our findings, they were put to the table and tested against the excavated regions.

Fortunately, I did not have to worry myself with the if's and the maybe's my fellows were stricken by. My task, was relatively simple. The device that gave this message, was to be fully examined for each and every trace of data it could possibly hold. And given the average dozens of pebibytes of storage available on traditional Coalition hardware. There was no doubt in anyone's mind, that there was certainly going to be an extensive amount on this drive, even if it was an older model of one.

Unfortunately, we ran into a roadblock at couple days into our decryption. Whoever did the encrypting on the drive, really, really, didn't want it to be uncovered. In addition, a massive chunk of its internal software was completely foreign in nature, and since we were bereft of the ability to ask the creators how their code worked and what did what. We were left on our own to figure things out.

Expectedly, progress had been quite slow.

So as I entered the laboratory once more, seeing the drive place the center on a pedestal, with connecting wires joining it with the various terminals that circled it. I had a feeling as to what I'd be hearing again today.

""Anything yet?"" I announced to everyone in the room, as expected I received various forms of a no.

""We are making some progress ma'am, but every layer we break through, another one several times thicker hits us in the face."" Said one of the team members on my right. I took a sip of the warm coffee within my hands, letting the taste ruminate for a while, before placing it onto the stand that laid before me.

""It could also be the degradation."" Another member announced from the same corridor announced, her tone a tad more tired than her compatriot.

""UEF technology certainly is built to endure, but buried for centuries beneath the scorching hot sands? It would be safe to say that it wouldn't be working properly."" They said, on the surface it did sound like a good point, but only on the surface.

""If that was the case, we wouldn't have found that first message. Remember, it was buried, but within an airtight vault. Whoever put it here, might have wanted the message to endure."" I said, earning a simple shrug from them as they looked back to the drive at the room’s center.

""Be that as it may ma'am, its still no use to us if we hope to crack this thing open.""

I ruminated on those words for a moment, thinking to myself what to do now, it was clear that in our current state, getting past this roadblock of ours would take far, far longer than any would reasonably like to have. But then again, we are only one team, on one site.

Perhaps this puzzle requires looking else for the pieces.

""Have we heard anything from Site Beta?""

Location: Covasteli System - Scout Ship Eridanev

“Systems are reporting all clear, and we’re still intact. I’d call that a successful warp captain.” Announced Keltor. The second in command giving his terminal’s screen a final check before the sivkit let out a grateful sigh.

It was quite understandable as to why the trip had placed such stress upon them after all, the extensive system we now found ourselves in had quite the bad reputation. One that supposedly made it one of the most dangerous in the galaxy that wasn’t where the humans were.

Tales of entire convoys of ships going missing, regardless of their unique class or affiliation were enough to discourage many who would dare try to explore this system. FTL drives completely failing to spool up when simply approaching the system, like it was rejecting our presence. This vessel however, it was lucky enough to not experience such failure to its engines. But beyond that, it seemed that this crew was now on its own.’

“Get as much power to the sensors as you can.” Captain Bilyeth quickly announced to the bridge crew before him.

“The last thing we want is to end up another tale in this system’s tapestry. Understood?” He asked, earning a quick set of positive confirmations of that statement.

The captain then pulled up a holographic map of the surrounding area, which was constantly being fed a stream of data from the extensive suite of aforementioned sensors and detectors dotted all over the ship’s hull. As the information piled in, it became quickly visually apparent how this system had gained such a notorious reputation across the galaxy, Captain Bilyeth could feel his ears fall a bit in growing concern as he took in all of the data the map was relaying towards his eyes.

The map was dotted, head to paw, with various sized grey blobs of uneven shapes and formations. It took no time for the captain to recognize what it was he was seeing before him, meteors and planetoids. One wrong move, and they would crash ourselves directly into immense rocky tides.

Minute by minute, inch by inch, the captain slowly maneuvered the ship towards a more clear region of the system, and finally the stress of the delicate maneuvering began to wane down, until eventually. They finally had managed to move their way out of the storm and into a noticeably more manageable region of the system. The ship’s speed reduced further as the crew began to scan their surroundings for any more potential imminent dangers to the ship. To the thanks of everyone aboard, they found themselves free of such dangers. Bilyeth gave a sigh of relief at that fact.

“Good work everyone. We’re through what seems to be the worst of it.” He said to the bridge below, the look on everyone’s faces showing the same level of

“It better be.” Keltor utter dejectedly, his tone showing frustration at the situation as opposed to relief.

“Captain. What’s the point of us being here?  What could be worth coming to a system like this?” Keltor asked, simply receiving a groan from his captain who glared down at him.

“I'm sure you already know the answer to that.” Bilyeth said,

“Surely there could be better options for regions to place ourselves right? Much safer spots than this one as well.” Keltor said, at that Bilyeth’s glare softened a-bit, he’d felt the same thing as Keltor numerous times, that naive feeling that there had to be a better option to choose. How he wished he could humor it.

""If there were any, our herd would have been made aware of such a thing.""

""We’ve always been on the thin line between ""

""But, of all the places in the galaxy?” The captain turned to face his second in command, his

""Where else could we go?"" He asked, before listing of the regions off limits to them.

""Federation worlds are a no go for a multitude of obvious reasons, and we aren’t exactly a very notable voice at the summit are we?""

""And with that new race of predators taking up residence, anything even near the Venlil or Gojid home planets are immediately a write off.""

Keltor found himself resigned himself to silence after hearing those points being brought up, the captain was right after all. Being one of the rare Federation species without a homeworld of their own had made the entire race heavily dependent on their fleet for everything. Which often meant that when arxur incursions did happen, they rarely were able to provide assistance to the larger Federation, which combined with their heavily nomadic lifestyle, had made them quite the pariahs amongst their fellow prey species.

""That goes for those backwaters as well Keltor!” Bilyeth said, his tone taking on a more harsh and disdainful attitude now, much to his subordinate’s surprise.

""Just because the Federation signed an armistice with those freaks from the Thafki Concordat and Yotul Hegemony, does not mean that we will ever stoop to-""

""I assure you, I wasn't thinking that captain!"" Keltor said raiding his front paws defensively. He could tell from the captain’s face that if he were to even suggest such a thing, he’d be in for a lifetime of trouble. Keltor didn’t know much about those species on the periphery of known space, but from what he could gain from the tone of Bilyeth, they weren’t species worth being associated with, regardless of what some thought they could provide.

""I'm just...worried, is all."" He said, the captain’s mood shifted quickly after that returning to a more calmed demeanor.

""Thats understandable."" Bilyeth said.

""Just try and keep in mind the bigger picture here. And look on the bright side. We’re in supposedly one of them most treacherous systems the Federation’s discovered. And while it’s not been long, we’re managing to navigate through it with remarkable efficiency.”

That statement seemed to been enough to ease Keltor’s mind, who turned back to this station, content to continue his duty as required of him

Unbeknownst to him, and the crew at large that confidence of was very much misplaced.

Had the captain paid attention to the still active holographic display of the surrounding area, he might have notice an….irregularity.

He might have noticed the strange pattern of one of the asteroids far outside of the ship's reach. He might have noticed its unusually perfect trajectory, and how it never seemed to collide with any of the surrounding asteroids.

And how it seemed to be moving away from them, quite fast too. Far faster than it should have any right to move.

The problem arises with any sort of PDA or other “couple activities” (for lack of a better word).

Lack of intimacy has also left me pretty touch starved and frustrated, which is becoming a distraction that I don’t want to have to deal with.

My question is, how did you guys get over these feelings and urges? Even a temporary fix would work as I would like to get back into the scene after I finish school.

I have talked to some close friends about this and many have suggested either a massage or seeing an escort.

The Treasury has revealed a Sh103.76 billion termination or break fee that Kenya will pay to the owners of the Nairobi Expressway should the 27- year public-private deal be terminated prematurely. The disclosures show termination of the Chinese-backed expressway dwarfs all other public-private partnership (PPP) break fees, underscoring the extent to which its owners sought to protect themselves from regime transitions in a country where new administrations have cancelled or revised mega projects. Locally incorporated Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Construction (CRBC), built and funded the construction of the 27.1-kilometre super highway and will recoup its investments from tolling over 27 years.



\*•	Current account deficit widens to 2.2pc of GDP\*

Higher imports of intermediate and capital goods widened Kenya’s current account deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP in the year to October 2025 up from 1.5 percent in the preceding similar period last year. The deficit widened despite the country recording higher export earnings from horticulture, coffee, manufactured goods, and apparel during the year under review. During the period, imports grew 9.6 percent on rising intermediate and capital goods orders, while exports increased 6.7 percent, creating an imbalance that expanded the deficit during the twelve-month cycle.



\*•	Centum to issue dollar real estate fund in January\*

Centum Investment Company expects to issue a dollar denominated income Real Estate Investment Trust (I-Reit) at its Two Rivers special economic zone in Nairobi in January 2026, handing the Kenyan market its first foreign currency denominated Reit. The company is eyeing a Sh4.78 billion ($37 million) from the proposed I-Reit, which is pending regulatory approval, with the proceeds earmarked for construction of green commercial property in the Two Rivers International Finance and Innovation Centre (Trific). Centum, which had stated its intention to float the dollar Reit at the beginning of this year, will be paying investors a dollar return of about eight percent. The company plans to issue long-term, dollar-based leases with guaranteed annual escalations on the property to be developed using the proceeds of the Reit, to achieve a currency match between the investment and returns.



\*•	Half of banks snub fresh CBK loans pricing formula for benchmark rate\*

Banks have chosen different benchmarks to price loans under the new risk based formula, denying customers a uniform reference rate to assess the cost of borrowing. The Central Bank of Kenya has noted that nearly half of the 37 lenders have opted for the Central Bank Rate (CBR) as their key reference rate with only a minority adopting KESONIA as their benchmark. The final revised risk-based credit pricing model was to be anchored on the Kenya Shilling Overnight Interbank Average (Kesonia), which is the overnight lending rate among banks as rate as CBK pushed to strengthen the transmission of its monetary policy decisions. The regulator, however, left the window for banks to use the CBR as a backup benchmark rate where Kesonia was deemed as impractical.



\*•	How KTDA bosses hurt market with floods of poor-quality tea supplies\*

A section of Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) directors deliberately influenced the supply of low-quality stocks to the regional auction, hoping to irregularly benefit from a guaranteed reserve price, an audit has revealed. The audit by the Tea Board of Kenya (TBK) established that some rogue officials allowed factories located west of the Rift Valley to supply poor quality tea to the auction after the government introduced a $2.43 (Sh 314.09) reserve price for every kilogram of tea sold at the Mombasa auction in July 2021. The reserve price was introduced as a guarantee that smallholder farmers would fetch a minimum return on the tea they supplied to KTDA.

First off: the grinder itself is fine! Due to its stock burrs (which are pretty much like SSP MP burrs) it just produces a different grind and I struggled with that. Whatever I was used to with the Robot, it looked like it all didn't work anymore. I only produced sour garbage, had runny shots, ground to the level of Turkish to no avail (obviously 😂), etc. I went to bed feeling discouraged and pondering whether this grinder is right for me. I decided I wouldn't immediately give up, though.

So, this morning a new try and... it was much better! Things I noticed in my case with these beans:

* **A preheated Robot might be a bitch**. Pulled back-to-back shots yesterday and I strongly suspect it influenced my shots in a bad way. I probably should've thought of this before, but temperature control on the Robot is a messy variable anyway, so I'm not sure to what extent I could've gotten it right.
* **Definitely skip the pre-infusion**. My other grinder is a Starseeker E55 Pro, which produces way more fines, and I pretty much had to pre-infuse for 5-10 seconds in my experience (it at minimum didn't have a negative effect if I did it). But with the grind from the 65 AP that'll just cause the shot to run really fast 🙃 Instead, I need to ramp up to \~6 bars in a second or 2, hold that for some time and decline the pressure from there to prevent the shot from running too fast (because once it goes, it *goes*). This was much better.
* **Tamp harder?** I used to do just a light tamp, but it seems like that's not an option here. Puck prep in general seems more important. At least, based on yesterday evening's experiments. The shot would run too fast no matter what, I got channeling, etc. I might experiment with this again with the different pressure profile I'm using now and the lack of pre-infusion.

The two shots I made this morning were much, much better than yesterday evening's and I feel kind of optimistic now, haha. As expected, body was definitely thinner, but not in a watery way, just ""not syrupy."" There was a more pronounced acidity, but *not* the unpleasant kind. Some of the tastes of this bean really started to come through. With my other grinder it was basically one big punch of almond in your face; this was... different. I'll have to do some more adjustments to really get there, but it's looking interesting.

A side note on Aeropress with this thing: I can let the coffee steep much longer without it becoming bitter now, I suppose due to less fines. That's nice :) Haven't experimented a lot with that yet, though.",5,1765441731.0,CafelatRobot,4,1.0,False

In the 16th century there were people who believed forks were sinful. When the car was invented, some people believed it to be sinful also. Now we have people who say coffee was sinful, certain music styles were sinful (even though I wouldn’t use a lot of styles in congregational singing in church, however, they do have their belonging in other types of spiritual songs, similar to David‘s skilled harp playing), wearing beards was sinful, owning a gun was sinful, not owning a gun was sinful, having kids was sinful, contraception was sinful, eating meat was sinful on Fridays, not wearing black on funerals was sinful, working as a truck driver was sinful, using cannabis oil was sinful, women avoiding make up was sinful, men not being circumcised was sinful, doing workout was sinful… it‘s just silly to believe those things were sinful in of itself, however, one who believes so isn’t automatically a heretic. He might just have a good intention that might not be so good. It does become problematic when he doesn‘t respect your conviction, however, you may have to accept him as someone weaker in the faith.

A recent article described a small coffee shop in the United States that actually stopped accepting credit cards. With profit margins of only 5–10 percent and card fees reaching 3–4 percent, the owner said it felt like credit card fees had become the “highest paid employee” in the business. Instead, the shop started accepting stablecoin payments, cutting out some of the intermediaries and keeping more of each sale.

This kind of story is no longer limited to crypto native users. It reflects a broader shift where merchants, from small cafes to cross border ecommerce brands, are exploring stablecoins as a practical way to reduce costs and protect margins, especially when card fees and FX charges keep adding up.

For merchants in similar situations, a few practical advantages tend to stand out:

* Settlement can be fast and does not depend on banking cut off times.
* The overall fees can often be lower than traditional card processing.
* Transfers are final, so there is no card style chargeback process once a payment is completed.
* Fewer or no additional FX related fees added on top, which can be meaningful for cross border sales.

A lot of the strongest reactions usually come when we talk about chargebacks. Some merchants mention situations where a high value order has already been shipped and delivered, only for a dispute to appear weeks later. Others talk about friendly fraud, where a customer claims they did not place the order or did not receive the item even though there is delivery proof. In certain verticals, once the chargeback ratio rises, they start to worry about account reviews, rolling reserves, or even sudden holds from their payment providers.

From your perspective, which of these would make the biggest difference for your business? Would faster settlement, lower cost, the absence of card style chargebacks, or avoiding FX related fees on cross border payments be the primary reason for considering this kind of checkout? Or would it need several of these advantages coming together at the same time before you would seriously consider trying it?

If you have dealt with difficult chargeback situations before, we would also be very interested to hear what those looked like in your industry and how you handled them.",2,1765441701.0,StablecoinCheckout,0,1.0,False

You really want to meet then and you have a great rapport. It's all going swell. But there's a finger in the pudding. Personally, I'm terrible at coffee dates or drink dates. Going to a cafe or a bar, sitting down at a table, there's waaaay too much in it for me to act normal.

1pjsg93,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultADHDSupportGroup/comments/1pjsg93/diagnosed_has_child/,Diagnosed has child,"My History: I was formally diagnosed with ADHD as a child by an educational psychologist,a specialist in early childhood development and learning. It was a real diagnosis, not just a guess. But I'm from the Caribbean, and in my family and community, this was dismissed. It was seen as an ""outside"" idea, not a real issue. The diagnosis wasn’t ignored but they just said i was just hyperactive and I would grow,(funny enough I did grow out of it ,now I’m not even active) and any recommended follow up never happened.

My Current Reality (The Fallout): The coping strategies that got me through childhood are failing completely as an adult. My life is showing clear signs of collapse:

· Academic Freefall: My university attendance tells the whole story: I attended most classes in first year, only some in second year, and now I have not been to a single class this semester. It’s not a choice it’s a total breakdown in my ability to start and follow through, even when I know how important it is. · Daily lack of motivation:I often feel like I ""can barely move through the day."" Starting simple tasks feels impossible. · Crippling Forgetfulness: I miss important deadlines and obligations constantly, which hurts my credibility. · Impulsivity with Consequences: I recently made a fast, bad decision, sold something, and got scammed. It was a direct result of not pausing to think. · Survival Only Mode: I operate on last-minute panic. I scrape through exams by cramming, but I’m not truly learning. I’m not building a life,I’m just trying to stop the next crisis.

My Body's Clue: Caffeine makes me sleepy. Any kin coffee, soda, energy drinks. It calms me down. I’ve learned this is a common sign in ADHD, where a stimulant has a ""paradoxical"" calming effect on the brain. Or any drugs like that(never took any non prescribed drugs or weed)

My Deep Conflict: I am stuck between two truths:

1.	⁠The Fact: A professional childhood diagnosis, and a life full of matching symptoms that are now getting worse.
2.	⁠The Wall: Caribbean cultural stigma that views this as a personal/moral failing, not a medical condition. There's also my own fear of getting an ""official"" adult diagnosis on my record and the pressure to just ""handle it myself.""

I know what’s wrong. I’ve done the research. But taking the step to get help feels like betraying the ""just push through"" mindset I was raised with.

Why I’m Posting: I need to hear from people who understand this specific struggle.

· Caribbean people (or from similar diasporas): How did you overcome the cultural stigma and family pressure to finally seek help for ADHD or other neurodivergence? · Anyone whose childhood diagnosis was ignored: How did you finally, as an adult, decide to reclaim that diagnosis and get the support you needed? What was the final straw? · Those afraid of the medical system: Was getting the official adult diagnosis as scary or limiting as you feared? How did it actually impact your life? Do you have take drugs? Because once I start something in a cycle it becomes like a addiction

I’m not looking for validation that I have it. I’m looking for the courage to act on what I already know. How did you move from knowing to doing when everything and everyone around you told you not to?",1,1765441597.0,AdultADHDSupportGroup,3,1.0,False

Since I was young, I knew many things without rational thought. I would receive these beautiful visions that often came true — sort of like a premonition of sorts. For example, before I really grew in my faith, God showed me a vision of someone painting a mosaic in the temple of the Lord, and while I wasn’t sure what it meant, it felt like God was truly speaking to me

Sure enough, the next day I encountered several different mosaics—the first in the opening chapters of Esther, and then another on a friend’s coffee table at their place. Before that, I had never seen one in person.

When I asked God for clarity about if my visions were true and coming from the holy spirit, he called me to read the story of Daniel. I had never heard of the story before despite its popular references in Christian culture and much to my surprise, it accounts his experience receiving Gods visions.

What’s weighing me now is the fact that these visions are growing quite dark. I’m afraid, and recently had a vision, or what really felt like a message from God that I would end up taking my life and it would be God honouring in some way. To go to heaven sooner

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with a health condition that I feel like I’m losing to. Perhaps it’s part of the plan, because most days are anguish and pain. I’m starting to think that the Lord doesn’t want me to suffer on the planet the way I am and to come back to him, but only when it’s time.

The journey?

To travel 221 miles from the tiny mountain spring where the River Severn is born… all the way to the sea.

Solo.

In winter.

Unmedicated by comfort, unsupported by a team, and fully exposed to whatever the river decides to throw at me.

The first stretch, I’ll walk beside the river to Llanidloes with my only mate — River, my 12‑week‑old cocker spaniel pup.

After that, I get into my kayak… and it’s just me, the cold water, and hope.

No backup vehicle.

No hotels.

Just wild camping, courage, and the belief that recovery is still possible — even when your own mind tells you otherwise.

Because this journey isn’t about adventure.

As I moved through the house, the AI followed me—fluid, aware, almost alive—feeding me live updates, reminders, and information as if it had always been part of my daily routine. When I got dressed and asked, “How do I look?” it answered without hesitation: “The pants and boots work well, but swap the shirt for your black button-up and pair it with a dress jacket.”

Before I left, it seamlessly linked to my car and pushed traffic conditions, local alerts, and anything else I needed for the day.

When I actually woke up—around 04:30 AM—the dream was still burning in my mind, so I sat down and started building. No plan, no training, just momentum.

It’s highly likely it’s just from a sad indie playlist they pulled off Spotify, but it’s cool to hear Adrianne’s older discography in a random coffeeshop, let alone one of my favourites from Hours Were the Birds. The whole album itself is such a beautiful project even though I’d probably never get to hear those songs live.

Anyways, just thought to share this experience <3 have a great day ",3,1765441116.0,adriannelenker,0,0.81,False

I’ve recently been trying to make my diet a bit cleaner, and one thing I wanted to replace was **refined white sugar**. I came across **desi khand**, which is an unrefined, more natural form of sugar, and I’m honestly surprised more people don’t talk about it.

Here’s what I liked about it so far:

* It’s **less processed**
* It has a **rich caramel-like flavour**
* It’s **chemical-free** (no bleaching agents like refined sugar)
* Works amazingly in **chai, coffee, halwa, kheer, laddoos**, etc.
* Feels *lighter* on the stomach

If anyone is planning to switch, I found a genuine online source that sells pure desi khand — not the fake “brown sugar” most markets sell:  
👉 [https://desikhand.in/](https://desikhand.in/)

Just wanted to share in case someone else is looking for a healthier sweetener option.  
Would love to hear your experience — **do you guys use desi khand?** If yes, which brand do you prefer?",1,1765441079.0,u_ChetanJindal67,0,1.0,False
