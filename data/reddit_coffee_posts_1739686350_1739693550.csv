1iqnkq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchDogs_Legion/comments/1iqnkq9/watch_dogs_4_idea/,WATCH DOGS 4 IDEA,"I wanted to share my idea for the watch dogs 4. I enjoy the watch dogs franchise with WD2 being my favorite. I also thought WDL was underrated and WD1 I thought was wasted potential. I'm hoping for watch dogs 4 soon. The idea i had for the watch dogs 4 game is taking place in Japan, Tokyo. I believe this would be a cool city to play in because of how technological advanced Tokyo Japan is and how cool the city digital lights look since Tokyo has so much digital billboards it would be cool to hack them in game. The next game should also include the best hacking with all the previous games hacking features combined. Hackable billboards, cars, drones, atm, civilians, sewers, construction equipment, bridges, blackout,. It should also include the most activities from previous games including the digital trips, racing, driver deliveries, soccer, driver sf, AR games, fight club, darts, boat racing, drone racing.  Add way more customization like WD2 and legion with customizable cars, clothing, haircut, and customizable drones. The ability to parkour around Tokyo with zip lines. Imagine zip line on the roofs of Tokyo it would be so badass and fun. And the ability to traverse on rooftops. A much bigger range for the personal drone. Bring back the rideable drones from legion and make them go up much higher and faster. As for gameplay bring back the HQ from WD2 with multiple unlockable HQ by completing the story and optional unlockable safe houses like WD1. Maybe add the ability to customize them and add much more interiors like WD1/2. Imagine all the cool and creative places we can visit in Tokyo. So much potential. Clothing shops, Kawaii clothing, car dealerships, bars, pawn shops, strip clubs, HQs and safe houses, coffee shops, banks. Maybe add more crine related activities like robberies
 I always have wished for watch dogs game to have this but add the ability to ride the spider bot in free roam. Imagine all the chaos using the spider tank it would be so badass traversing the Tokyo. Bring back focus from WD1 and maybe add new abilities as well like a rage mode from gta v where we get complete invincibility for a couple of minutes or a speed mode where we move super fast. Bring back gangs like in WD1/2 and calling gang attacks on pedestrians and also calling cops as well. The creative idea i had for the next game was making the entire game completely cell shaded and have a anime like art style. Now I know this sounds really goofy but I believe it will fit with this game alot and the watch dogs franchise because it will take place in Tokyo and the art style is will what make it stand out from gta and make it a true competitor. Now imagine a open world cell shaded crime game. Oh yea Watch dogs 4. Now this is the other idea I had since guns are banned in japan what if instead of using firearms we used 3D printed and tapered powered weapons so the devs will have to get creative with the combat and the combat is like sleeping dogs mostly melee and somewhat ranged weapons. Since the guns are banned we have to rely on taser pistols, crossbows, nail guns, flash bangs, 3d printed pistol, 3d printed shotgun, taser rifle from legion,. Or we can also have full out firearms and the gameplay writing can just say oh we smuggled these weapons to japan. Alright these are my ideas for the Watch dogs 4
 Let me know your ideas and feel free to share them. Thank you for reading and I'm hoping and praying for the ubisoft to make the watch dogs 4. ",1,1739693371.0,WatchDogs_Legion,0,1.0,False

Hi internet stranger ! I‚Äôm just a girl (cue the song ) . I‚Äôm hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am .

I am a student, at a new job, won't have health insurance until next month. Ran out of Adderall XR 25mg a couple days ago and I have been struggling. I opened my box of powders and have Pramiracetam, Aniracetam, Flmodafinil, Noopept, and Emoxypine.

I'm planning on taking 30mg Noopept, 80mg Flmodafinil, and 400mg Pramiracetam in the mornings. Then I will take another Pramiracetam or two throughout the day if need be. I'm also going to take Alpha-GPC and Ginkgo Biloba. 

I was wondering if adding Aniracetam or Emoxypine would be helpful/safe. I think I remember Aniracetam not doing much at first, and I only plan on doing this stack for a couple of weeks. 

Also, if any of the doses that I've listed aren't safe, please let me know. 

I was also wondering if I'll be okay to drink coffee with this stack. 

I typically take none of these Nootropics, but I have a few times a couple years ago.

In my current example, my almost 4 year old and I are downstairs at 7am but she‚Äôs refusing to wear trousers (has pyjama top on). 

She‚Äôs whining to have milk first but I said trousers first. This back and forth goes on for a while, still whining, so I leave the living room to have coffee for 15 minutes. 

Come back and still the same power struggle. Tried to explain she needs to put on trousers anyway for going to softplay soon. Tried to explain her legs are cold. Tried to put it on but she‚Äôs strong enough to wriggle out and kick it off. Given up for now. 

How do others handle this? My husband threatens her with naughty step which works, but I do not want to do that. Should I be? 

Is the obvious answer to just let her have milk when she first asked and pick your battles? Or is it better to hold boundaries? Thanks for reading!

1iqna2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/comments/1iqna2s/sagada_2025_updated_trip_report/,Sagada 2025 Updated Trip Report,"Trip Report. My way of giving back sa nakuha kong guidance and tips from generous redditors. ‚ù§Ô∏è

D1
10am ETA sa Sagada. Upon arrival, derecho sa tourism center, bayad fees, attend quick mandatory seminar, pay optional insurance (50-100 lang naman).. Next, punta sa nearest accredited tour agency which is SEGA. There are 5 agencies pero malayo ung iba. Palista bet na tours sa SEGA. Medyo magulo sila kausap, hindi ung parang manila level na agencies na organized ah so manage your expectations.

11:30 Early lunch sa Palengke eateries. Eto recommended rin sa reddit. I missed siguro if may nagmention na nasa 200-300 ang per order dito. Nagulat lang kami kasi akala namin mura since province. Pero masarap naman. Sa Kusinan Mal-ig ata kami if harap nun basta may Sinanglaw sila. Konti lang rin yung local food, puro familiar ones ang nasa menu. Hindi masarap yung brewed coffee. Not sure kung dahil 30php lang ba, pero sa last day namin, we bought brewed rin from resto, hindi rin masarap haha lasang tubig pag nirefill mo cup mo after mo magkape. Ganun ka diluted ang lasa.

Afternoon. Check in sa Andrew & Mary‚Äôs Lodging House. Ok dito, nasa 3rd floor yung admin so hindi nakakaconscious maglabas pasok unlike sa ibang accomm. May heater ang shower, may free bfast, mabait ang attendant. 

After resting saglit, larga na. 1st stop Bana‚Äôs coffee. As highly recommended here. True enough, lasang kape sa manila ang quality. During our entire stay here, naka 3x kami na order at tambay dito. Tried Ube latte (saks lang), Mocha (‚ù§Ô∏è), and Salted Caramel (saks lang). And winner yung boston creme cheesecake ü´∂‚ú® babalikan!!!

Pottery. Walked long and hard (uphill) para marating to haha kasama na rin pa expi sa area kaya we chose to walk. Maganda rin kasi weather so sayang madaliin. ‚ÄúClass‚Äù was quick and straightforward, tama naman ung nagcomment here na halos un teacher na ang gumawa kahit ikaw ang nakahawak sa clay hahaha but good expi na rin. Masarap ung homemade cheesebread nila.

Yoghurt house. Maasim. Di ko bet. Maganda lang pwede tumambay sa veranda at magpeople watching.

Salt N Pepper dinner. Tried Etag Carbonara ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂‚ú® and Etag Isig üéâüí£ winner both. Tie ba. Bonus may pusa silang Cheesecake ang name. Nagpapabuhat ‚ù§Ô∏è

Piitik wines - one of the highlights of our trip. Cool concept talaga. May corner kung nasan ang coin bucket for payment, card terminal at gcash qr code haha masarap un wines. 40 per shot, pwede half. Naka 4 kami each. Hindi sya kita agad from hiway ah need pumasok sa gate. Medyo may ilaw naman so dont worry hehe

D2
Dahil magulo nga kausap si SEGA, we were waiting since last night ng confirmation ng Marlboro Hils and Blue Soil tour namin tom. Pero nung dumaan kami sa office nila at tumawag, sabi wait na lang daw until tomorrow morning. At since malapit lang accomm namin sa SEGA at tourism center, di na kami nagpastress at sabi namin makikijoiner na lang kami sa ibang group kung sakali. So nakaready na kami by 4:30, walang text. We went out sa street, walang ibang maghhike. Hmm we walked to SEGA, walang tao. We called ung nakausap naming local kahapon sa SEGA, on the spot naghanap sya ng available na guide. Lesson is, dont be so stressed, chill lang mga tao dun, so chill ka lang rin haha

Marlboro hills - as a non hiker, swabe naman ito. May short portion lang na ahon na ahon pero since generally ok un road, di mahirap. Didnt see the sea of clouds, na by chance lang talaga makikita daw. Oh well not the end of the world.
Blue soil - mas challenging papunta dito at may pagkapit sa mga ugat ng puno level. So pag di ka fit, medyo pahirapan. Pero worth it pagkadating. üëèüèº

Maglight bfast lang kayo paakyat at may stores naman sa both peaks. Even sa stops. 

Nakauwi na kami sa accomm by 8:30 yata. Ate bfast, napped, then gutom na kami uli. 

Late lunch at Log Cabin. Nabasa ko here na blockbuster to so we thought sakto 2pm na kami kakain. Pero mabagal pa rin sila magserve kahit 2 lang kami na group of 3 ang customers that time hehe pero ok lang. we ordered Menu 1 (ü´∂) and Menu 5 (ü´¢) good ambience.

Next! We booked a Hanging Coffin tour sa SEGA rin, kaso hindi macontact ung kausap namin haha consistent no. So pumunta kami sa tourism center to ask san pa pwede maghanap ng guide. Bawal daw sila magdirect recommend at tinuro kami sa SEGA lol üòÜ so kinoktak nalang namin ung mga number ng ibang agencies sa pamphet (see photo) may isang nagreply at nagbigay ng number ng tour guide. Nakipag arrange kami ng meetup kasi gogora na, nag ok naman. Upon meetup, pamangkin daw nya na college student ang sasama at busy sya haha edi kami ah ganun ok. Tapos pagdating sa entrance ng HC, hinarang kami since hindi nila kilala ung kasama namin. Nagusap sila then sabi samin ng admin, bawal daw ung guide namin at di accredited. So kami ah ok, ano po option kako. Buti meron silang nakastandby na guide doon. Baka talamak ang pamangkin moves kasi. So we‚Äôre very glad to take the offer. Mabait yung guide, si ate Mary. dami trivias, so naisip namin pano kung si totoy ung sumama baka di sya magkwento or di nya masagot mga tanong namin hehe good expi rin. Naging challenging kasi umambon so malamig lalo.

Merienda saga: took trike to Misty lodge. Fave reco rin dito yun. Yoghurt talaga winner ü•á super creamy. Naka 2 order kami haha. Cozy feels, good burger too. Limited lang menu pero ok lang, mukhang namaster nila ung foods dahil dito. Next! Cellar Door. Cool concept ng bonfire with strangers na nagpapa init rin, while beer-ing the cold üòâ nakaka relax.

D3 - last day! Wala ko sepanx at nagawa ko naman ang mga gusto ko matry. Hehe

8am strolled to the street market for pasalubongs. Bought vegie chips (sobrang sarap guys pwede overselling ‚ú®), tinapa & tuyo from LU, ETAG 250-350/pack, sulit at kung san san dish na namin nagagamit, pasta, pancit, as bacon, etc.

10am packup 

12nn lunch at Chow Restaurant (not sa market but may resto talaga lampas Log Cabin), nabasa ko lang rin here. Ok naman food. Lasang normal eatery food sa Manila.

3pm ETD. Pahabol na try ng nabasa sa reddit, Lemon pie from COOP. Pumunta ako sa coop, tinuro ako sa store daw sa sakayan ng bus sa plaza. Ung store sa right ang meron, 50Php ata yun. Mukhang normal na pie. Maasim daw sabi ng kapatid ko. Di ko natry kasi naexcite akong iabot as pasalubong un tapos nahiya ako makikagat since ako me dala hahaha

My reviews:
1. sakto lang ang 4D3N. Kasama na 12hr per way. Beyond this, I think stretched or boring na. Here‚Äôs what we did na happy ako, as a person na experience > rest ang habol. 
2. Hindi pala sleeper bus yung coda lines. Akala ko as in yung nakahiga ka na type. Nakaupo lang na narerecline. Medyo masakit sa balakang. Sulit bumyahe ng 9pm papunta para larga na agad pagbaba. Then 3pm pabalik Manila.
3. Bring cap/bonnet at normal ata nagddrizzle don at generally mahamog. Protect the bumbunan
4. Good coffee can be found sa coffee shops and not everywhere. 
5. Feeling safe ka lagi kahit bukas ata bag mo walang magnanakaw. Mababait mga locals. Given sa tourism industry sila kumikita, baka mas mayaman pa sila sakin na corpo slave at need mag ipon para makatravel haha
6. Mahal pero lasang normal ang foods.
7. Magkakakapit halos lahat ng spots na need mo puntahan. Better sa town center kumuha ng accomm kesa sa malayo. Hassle magtrike kada galaw.
8. Mahaba ung byahe so pwede doon magrest, then experience the place once you‚Äôre in. Nasayangan ako sa oras na doon magrest at less ganap, kasi I can rest naman once I get back sa manila, open ko lang AC ko. Same feels tbh.

""Copy from here""

You know that coffee shop‚Äîthe one where they don‚Äôt even ask your order anymore? You‚Äôre there with your best friend, warm cup in hand, espresso in the air. The conversation? Easy. No stiff monologues, no ‚Äúas per my last email‚Äù energy‚Äîjust real talk.

That‚Äôs exactly how your writing should feel. Not like a corporate memo. Not like a textbook. Just *you*, having a conversation that actually *hits*.

Because here‚Äôs the truth: People don‚Äôt want to be *talked at*. They want to be *pulled in*. They want to feel like they‚Äôre sitting across from someone real‚Äîsomeone who gets it. That‚Äôs the kind of writing people remember. The kind they share. The kind that makes them come back for more.

So how do you do it? Here‚Äôs how.

# How to Write Like a Human (Because, Shockingly, You Are One)

# ‚úÖ Keep it casual, keep it real.

Think about how you‚Äôd explain something to a friend. You wouldn‚Äôt drop a bunch of jargon or talk like a robot. You‚Äôd just *say it*.

* Instead of: *‚ÄúUtilizing strategic methodologies can enhance productivity across various domains.‚Äù*
* Try: *‚ÄúWant to get more done without losing your mind? Here‚Äôs what actually works.‚Äù*

See the difference? One sounds like a business meeting. The other sounds like *you*.

A great way to check yourself? Read your writing out loud. If it sounds weird coming out of your mouth, it‚Äôll sound weird in someone‚Äôs head.

And don‚Äôt be afraid to *break the rules a little*. Sentence fragments? Fine. A one-word paragraph? Cool. Writing should have rhythm. Some short. Some long. That‚Äôs what makes it *flow*.

# ‚úÖ Make it personal.

Stories stick. If you‚Äôre explaining something, don‚Äôt just drop facts‚Äî*bring people into a moment*.

Bad: *‚ÄúImposter syndrome is a common experience.‚Äù*  
Better: *‚ÄúI once sat in a meeting, convinced I was the least qualified person in the room. Everyone else seemed to know exactly what they were doing. Meanwhile, I was hoping no one would notice I had Googled half the terms on the agenda.‚Äù*

See how that *feels* different? When you tell a story, people don‚Äôt just *understand* what you‚Äôre saying‚Äîthey *feel* it.

Use sensory details. What did it smell like? What was running through your head? Was there a weird dude in the background making things even funnier? The more real it feels, the more people connect.

# ‚úÖ Throw in humor (but don‚Äôt force it).

Not everything has to be a joke, but a little personality goes a long way. A self-roast, a well-placed meme reference, or even just a relatable moment (*‚ÄúThis was giving big ‚Äòwhy did I agree to this‚Äô energy.‚Äù*) can make your writing fun to read.

Pro tip: Humor isn‚Äôt just about *what* you say‚Äîit‚Äôs about *how* you say it. A surprise twist, an unexpected comparison, or even just a playful tone can make a sentence *land*.

For example:

* Instead of: *‚ÄúI was nervous.‚Äù*
* Try: *‚ÄúMy heart was pounding like I had just texted ‚Äòhey‚Äô and got back ‚Äòhey.‚Äô‚Äù*

See? Feels different, right?

# ‚úÖ Stay fresh, stay relevant.

Ever read something that felt stale? Like it could have been written five years ago? Yeah, don‚Äôt do that.

If something big is happening in your industry, in pop culture, or even just in the *general vibe of the internet*, bring it in. It makes your writing feel alive.

Not sure where to start? Scroll Twitter (or X, whatever we‚Äôre calling it now). Check TikTok trends. See what people are *actually* talking about. Then, tie it into your topic in a way that makes sense.

For example, if you‚Äôre writing about burnout, maybe you mention that viral clip of Pedro Pascal saying *‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, boss.‚Äù* If you‚Äôre talking about focus, maybe you bring up how people are somehow reading *800-page fantasy books* but can‚Äôt answer an email.

Timeliness makes things hit *harder*.

# ‚úÖ Stick the landing.

Don‚Äôt just *end*‚Äî*leave them with something*. A mic-drop moment, a killer takeaway, or a call to action that actually makes them *think*.

Some ideas:

* A thought-provoking question: *‚ÄúBut hey, maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it‚Äîwhat do you think?‚Äù*
* A challenge: *‚ÄúTry this for a week and see what happens.‚Äù*
* A last, punchy line that lingers: *‚ÄúAt the end of the day, connection beats perfection‚Äîevery time.‚Äù*

You want people to walk away with something that *sticks*‚Äîsomething they‚Äôll remember long after they close the tab.

# The Bottom Line

Forget robotic. Forget boring. Forget trying to sound ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù at the expense of being *human*.

Write like you‚Äôd *talk*‚Äîlike you‚Äôre swapping stories over coffee.

Because in a world drowning in lifeless content, the most powerful thing you can do is be *real*.

Everything was wonderful at the beginning. I‚Äôve thought I‚Äôve met the sweetest, funniest, thoughtful man ever. We used to have a lot of fun together, although I felt that things were moving too fast at certain times. 

Everything was nice, till he started questioning me about my past bf, friends, even getting jealous out o nowhere about a guy I‚Äôve used being friends with. Every week he started to tell me that he dreamt that I was cheating on him or seeing guys behind his back when we were at the beginning. He also asked me why I hide some notifications on my phone from him, even though I was only checking the weather at 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning. 

We live in my apartment and I‚Äôve always reffered it as our home, not mine. It took me long talks to make him understant that he has to help me clean and cook. Now he helps me sometimes with cleaning, but usually I have to remind him to do the things he said he will do. 

If I am late from work he tells me stuff like ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôve stopped to shop‚Äù or ‚Äúthe trip back home was longer than usual‚Äù. He always asks me for pictures, when I get home and if I don‚Äôt answer his messages he calls me. If I don‚Äôt respond, he assumes something bad has happened to me. I must add that his parents died when he was a teenager. 

Fastforward to the last couple of months when I‚Äôve told him ‚Äúno‚Äù to sex because of cramps, or being tired (I have a very demanding job) and he usually gets upset and asks me if it‚Äôs something wrong with him. Once I‚Äôve told him I have an UTI, but he still initiated sex. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to justify why I don‚Äôt want sex. My fault, I guess. 

Last time it was early in the morning and he wanted sex. I‚Äôve told him no, because before coffee it usually lasts too long for me and he usually loses his erection. He got really mad telling me that he can prove me that it‚Äôs not the case. I wanted to leave the room, but he started throwing tantrums. I gave up, got back to bed and we had sex. I felt like an object, abused. 

Now he wants me to forgive him, crying, demanding physical touch. I feel like I am going crazy. That it‚Äôs also my fault for what happened. At the same time, I am feeling controlled and abused, but in a way I still love him. I am really lost. I don‚Äôt know if it was my fault. 

TL;DR: I [F,29] been with bf [M,30] for about a year. I feel he is very controlling and somehow forces being intimate with him. I also feel like it‚Äôs my fault and I am very confused. I don‚Äôt really know how to proceed and how to think about this situation. I feel that he is not inherently bad, but I can‚Äôt shake being uneasy around him now.

Please don't be surprised by the title I promise that I am Frugal üòÅ

Bit of a backstory: I used to buy stuff that I wanted when I still had budget left almost every month. So I didn't spend more than I had but also didn't save a lot. That went on until March last year when I found this supreddit and decides to give being frugal a try. And I love it!!! 
Since then I optimized my spending and still enjoy life. But I am now saving around 40% of my salary every month.
The only thing I've spend money on are my hobbies (Coffee, Photography).

So here is my problem: I have a quite good espresso machine (Lelit Mara X) which I bought used a year ago. Sadly the seller lied to me that he descaled the machine regularly which I found out a few days ago after opening the machine up. So the machine has some problems that can theoretically be solved, but would cost half of the price of a new machine. 
So I will try to fix it myself which I don't have much confidence that it will word tbh.

So I am also thinking about buying a new machine but now want something for life. Something that I can buy and keep for at least 10 years which I will take good care off. And I already wanted a La Marzocco Linea Micra since it came out. I can get a cheaper machine but that would always be a compromise in my head.

So I am now struggling between wanting it and being frugal and justifying the purchase. I can afford it without drying out my sayings or taking up a loan.

1iqn6in,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingInIndia/comments/1iqn6in/get_multiple_dates_every_week/,Get Multiple Dates Every Week,"While majority of the men waste time and money on dating apps or worse, This is how I get multiple dates every week:

1- I go out in high volume areas where people hangout for 30 min to 60 mins
2- I approach girls and start a conversation with them.(How I do it? - keep reading)
3 - If we get along well, then I proceed further and exchange numbers with her, if not, then I move on.
3- Sometimes if she is free, then we even on instant date.. Like a quick coffee or ice cream.
4 - I use online dating apps as an add-on.

I do this 2-3 times a week.

Then when the weekend comes, I have multiple dates lined up.

FAQ - 

1 -What if she freaks out or call the cops?
If you start a conversation in the right way, she will never do that. You are just talking to her not hitting on her, or teasing her. So relax!

2 - What do I say?
I compliment her, or I observe something about her and get the conversation going.. It's simple.

3 - I'm too scared to do this? 
It's normal to be afraid to do this. That's why I recommend start gradually,.start with small talks.

4. Isn't it creepy?
Absolutely not! Girls love it when a cool guy approaches them. Even if she has a boyfriend, she will politely tell you that and even thank you for making her day or talking to her! 

5 - Am I a Playboy for dating multiple girls? 
I sincerely believe you can choose the best partner for yourself when you have options unlike settling with the first one you can get because you don't have any other options.
Sometimes I have amazing long term relationships as well if we have awesome chemistry!

6 - Am I bragging?
I feel the cringe everytime I see posts on reddit M looking for F. Don't do that guys! That won't work! I'm sharing a better way which will resonate with only few of you and I will be the happiest for you! Rest will keep doing what they have done till now

What I found?

90% of guys are failing for the exact same reasons.

Here‚Äôs what I learned (and how you can instantly improve your matches & replies):

üö´ MISTAKE #1: Boring, Generic Openers
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHey‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your day?‚Äù

üëâ FIX: Start with something that stands out. Use their bio, photos, or a playful assumption. Example:
	‚Ä¢	If she‚Äôs holding a dog: ‚ÄúSo if I asked your dog who the better cuddler is, what would he say?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	If her bio says ‚ÄúFoodie‚Äù: ‚ÄúReal question‚Äîdo you judge people based on their pizza toppings?‚Äù

Why this works: People respond to energy, humor, and curiosity. If your opener sounds like a copy-paste from every other guy, you‚Äôre done before you start.

üî• MISTAKE #2: Playing It Too Safe
Most guys try to be ‚Äúpolite and respectful‚Äù (which is good), but they mistake that for being predictable and passive. If your messages are just you agreeing with her and asking boring questions, she will lose interest FAST.

üëâ FIX: Flirt. Tease. Be Playful. Create a fun challenge.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	Instead of ‚ÄúWhat do you do for work?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAlright, let me guess‚Ä¶ you either have a cool job or secretly run an underground fight club. No in-between.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Instead of ‚ÄúWhat kind of music do you like?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ before I answer that, do you judge people based on their playlists? Because if so, this is high-stakes.‚Äù

üöÄ MISTAKE #3: Taking Too Long to Move Things Forward
If she‚Äôs replying but the convo isn‚Äôt going anywhere, you‚Äôre losing momentum.

üëâ FIX: Add some mystery and set up the date EARLY.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou seem fun, but I need a real-world test. Let‚Äôs grab a coffee this week and see if you can keep up. üòâ‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThis convo is too good to waste in a chat. What‚Äôs your favorite spot for a spontaneous adventure?‚Äù

Final Takeaway:
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre struggling with Tinder, it‚Äôs NOT your looks‚Äîit‚Äôs your messaging & energy.
	‚Ä¢	Be different, be bold, and move fast.

1iqn18c,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1iqn18c/met_a_virgin_through_a_fetish_forum_and_im_unsure/,Met a virgin through a fetish forum and i'm unsure how to go about it.,"Hey Im M, mid/late 20's and i've been sexually active and engaged in the fetish communities for some time, so I'm very casual and kink friendly when it comes to sex.  
About 3 weeks ago i found a profile on a fetish forum, of a local F, couple years younger than me, who, according to her bio was new to the scene and interested in a D/s dynamic and going to events. She didn't have any pictures, but neither did I when I first started out, so I didn't think too much about it.

I shot her a message, welcoming her to the site and said she sounded like a genuinely nice person.  
The texting went on for about 2 weeks, where we would exchanged a few pictures, talked about what we were into, but also our vanilla hobbies.  
Though she seemed comfortable talking about all these things, she was quite cautious about stuff like meeting up irl, exchanging personal info etc. (which is totally understandable, it can seem like a bit of a crazy world, when you first get into it)

Here comes the kicker: We've obviously been going back and fourth about desires and experiences, but her stories always seemed a bit vague, so one day i asked her how much she's done before, to which she replies she's a virgin.  
I was obviously a little shocked, and didn't know how to react initially.  
We've been talking together for some times, some days for hours, and on a personal level we were getting along really well, so I didn't just wanna jump the ship, since I like her and I guess everyone is a virgin, until they're not.

I've tried to accommodate it with the upmost respect, telling her she's controlling the pace, and we'll see how things will go.  
It's been about 3 weeks now and i've obviously asked her, why she would seek out her first sexual experience on a fetish forum, and why she hasn't sought it out organically, through friends/parties etc.  
From what she has told me, it doesn't sound like she's struggling with traumatic experiences, religious family or any of the other 'classic' stigmas - she's just very shy and struggle a lot with taking the first steps.

During these talks she's also told me that she have been romanticising finding 'the one' and breaking out of it that way, but judging from her previous experiences, she wouldn't count on it in any near future.  
By nature she also has quite a high libido and genuinely show a lot of interest in the fetish scene, so if she wasn't a virgin I wouldn't have doubted her intentions for a second - also her desire for exploring seems to be a lot greater than her desire to find a partner currently, which makes it all the more complicated for her.

I guess my struggle here is, whether I'm doing the right thing??  
She seems like a really thought out person, with a good grip on her private and social life, so that's helping me a lot, knowing she's not at a low point in her life. We're having tons of fun texting and we're planning to meet up for a coffee some time soon(TM).

In reality I think I would like to hear from others in her shoes, how you view the situation - I'm trying to be as respectful as possible, keeping it friendly until she's ready, and my gut feeling isn't to cut it, but I think it's just a sensitive matter that I wanna know whether I'm handling correctly?",1,1739691031.0,virgin,0,0.67,False

1iqmz5v,https://i.redd.it/izvuva4vdgje1.jpeg,Question about airflow and dampers,"Hello!

I started roasting about a year ago, and got a Japanese sample roaster from Fuji royal (Coffee Discovery). Since I wanted to track the BT and BE temps with Artisan I modified it to use two temperature sensors (RTDs) from Phidgets.

This setup seems to work fairly well, but I noticed the RoR sky rockets whenever I use the sampling spoon or increase the damper (When using the sampling spoon it can go from say 14C to 20C really fast).

Is this normal? Or are the temp sensors too sensitive? (They are set at a sampling rate of 250ms)


Also I am unsure on how to effectively use the damper with this roaster it seem increase the temp drastically. Some Japanese sources I have read say you shouldn‚Äôt touch the damper at all during the roast.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you.

I posted on about my diagnosis here end of October 2024 and got such good tips and learned so much about T2. I‚Äôm sure like everyone else on here, I felt completely shocked and I did not sleep for the first week while I was wrapping my head around it. I kept picturing amputation and all other horrible complications that comes with diabetes. 

My a1c was 13.3 and fasting glucose was 18. Such high numbers but today I got my results back and it went down to 5.9 with a fasting glucose of 5.4. I‚Äôm 34F, 5‚Äô8 and currently 171 pounds. I was 191 pounds in October. I plan to lose 25 more pounds and try to maintain muscle mass. 

I tried going on the metformin however I got sick instantly after 2 days. I got a new doctor and he said he will let me try doing this with strict diet and exercise and see what happens. I started to walk daily during work hours (I go on the treadmill during my lunch) and a light walk on my walking pad at home after dinner. I live in Canada so walking outside at the moment isn‚Äôt possible. I follow a low carb, high protein, high fibre diet- basically keto. I don‚Äôt drink anything but water, black coffee and teas. I also intermittent fast on weekends. For the past month, I added dates as a dessert with some peanut butter and that now has been something I crave and it doesn‚Äôt spike me at all. I‚Äôm learning lots about T2 and I‚Äôm going through a list of foods that will spike me or not but for now I‚Äôm going to continue doing what I‚Äôm doing and see what my a1c will be by May. 

I just wanted to share my story. It wasn‚Äôt easy especially the first month. My numbers were all over the place (I do the finger prick) and it was giving me anxiety. I told myself to just calm down and trust the process. I did notice one thing though‚Ä¶when I got sick or on my cycle, my blood sugar would be high. I fasted one time till 1 pm and it was a 7 when normally it would be a 4. 
This is a lifelong condition, however I will say this new lifestyle has changed my life for the better. I feel healthier and also even happier.

Anyone that is newly diagnosed, just know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Just be determined, consistent and patient. Your health matters. You matter. Be kind to yourself.

1iqmurg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1iqmurg/aio_sil_drank_all_my_expensive_coffee_beans/,AIO - SIL drank all my expensive coffee beans!,"So my wife, son and I (39f), (16m) and (38m) are staying at my MIL house temporarily while our house is being remodeled. My SIL (43f) and her two kids live with MIL also. We are fortunate that there is actually plenty of space but obviously we are sharing the kitchen area with them.

Tonight after the rest of the family went to sleep, I was unloading the dishwasher in the kitchen and putting everything away. 

Previously, I had been gifted a bag of some pretty expensive Columbian coffee beans (which my sister had sent to me from Colombia for my birthday very recently). And I placed them basically near the coffee station or coffee area in the kitchen because there isn't really much storage in the room my wife and I are staying. The bag was sealed and its obvious that its not normal coffee beans that you would find at the grocery store.

So anyway, I'm putting away some coffee cups and I need to move the bag of my coffee. And pick it up only to find it weighs almost nothing - it's essentially empty. The seal is broken and the bag is really lazily closed back up.

I'm really kind of pissed about it because no one mentioned anything about it all or asked me  if it was cool to grind up some of the beans. Yes, everyone knew it was a gift to me because I opened it in front of them.

I know it was my SIL who used it because she is literally the only other one.who drinks coffee at the house. She will normally make a pot of coffee in the morning so she can give her daughter (6f) iced coffee in the morning. Which is the part that pisses me off the most. It's that it wasn't even appreciated. I guess I'm even more pissed off because my SIL is basically a freeloader living rent free in my MIL house and doesn't pay for shit groceries etc. Since we've been staying there we make Costco runs, cook dinner a few nights a week, clean up the kitchen, even pay 500  rent for the last month.

I really feel like confronting her about it tomorrow morning because I'm just really pissed about it. AIO?? Should I just let it slide? Or should I say something about it?

I was with my friend who I had spent valentines with. We went out to dinner and smoked at his place after to watch a movie so I slept over. The next day in the morning, we didn‚Äôt do anything much besides watch more movies and cuddle. We got coffee way later in the afternoon and I didn‚Äôt eat cause I chose not to eat. Bad idea, we went back to his place so I could get my stuff and that I‚Äôd be on my way 'cause I had somewhere to be. We smoked a bit more, and I accidentally ended up choking on the weed and had to cough it out. I instantly got high after that. I quickly got some water to calm down and I sat on the kitchen counter. I was alone for a bit cause he went to the bathroom. After he came back,  he saw I was rocking back and forth. He was still chatting with me and I was responsive although I don‚Äôt remember the convo.  He sat a bit farther across the room, he didn‚Äôt know that when I was leaning closer to the edge that I would fall and soon I did. Apparently, he tried to catch me but he was too late. I fell and was unconscious for two minutes after hitting the floor. He thought I was having a seizure and was trying to wake me up.  Flipping me over trying to shake me patting my back thinking I needed to throw up. What‚Äôs worse his mom came to his house to check on him. I never even met the woman and what a horrible first impression I made being knocked out on the floor. He got up from the floor and went to answer the door. He opens the door to talk to her telling her that he‚Äôs alright to come back later. Making sure she doesn‚Äôt see me through the crack but I‚Äôm pretty sure she did cause I woke up at the time confused. I was asking what happened and I made eye contact to the door window and saw her. I thought it was a neighbor. He heard me and came to my side immediately and tried to keep me awake cause I was going in and out of consciousness. I asked him about her and he said she didn‚Äôt see me but I swear she did. He took care of me for the rest of the hour and made sure I ate, feeding me and keeping me hydrated. I denied any hospital trips. He didn‚Äôt want me leaving and driving on the road just yet so I stayed a bit. But I fucked my face up I fell really hard that I saw a puddle of blood on the floor when I woke up. My lip is torn and swollen and my cheek has a bruise.  I‚Äôm embarrassed it happened, how he had to take care of me, and how scary it must‚Äôve been being in his shoes when I fainted. I‚Äôm worried he might not want to talk or hang out with me again.  After I was fine to drive he walked me out to my car. He told me to text him when I got home and I did and thank him for everything. It happened way earlier today around 5pm and I don‚Äôt know what else to say now. This ruined my Valentine's weekend after we just had a good time and I hope he doesn‚Äôt see me differently.  I don‚Äôt know how to handle this it‚Äôs more venting but any advice would be helpful.

1iqmnss,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1iqmnss/the_coma_prison/,The Coma Prison,"# 1 - THE TESTS

Marcus could hear everything.

The steady hum of the ventilator. The distant beeping of machines. The murmur of voices. He knew they were talking about him‚Äîdoctors, nurses, researchers. They always did.

But he couldn‚Äôt speak. He couldn‚Äôt move. He hadn‚Äôt moved in over six months.

‚ÄúMarcus, if you can hear me, imagine playing tennis,‚Äù said a calm, clinical voice. Dr. Vaziri. She was always the one speaking to him.

He did as he was told. He **thought**¬†about it. The weight of the racket, the tension in his fingers, the sound of the ball striking.

‚ÄúStrong activation in the premotor cortex,‚Äù someone murmured. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs responding.‚Äù

They were scanning his brain. Functional MRI, EEG, maybe both. He didn‚Äôt know exactly.

But he knew what it meant.

He wasn‚Äôt dreaming. He was **here**.

Trapped inside his body.

And he wasn‚Äôt alone.

Next to him, in another bed, was **her.**

Elena.

She had been here before him. She had been trapped longer.

And somehow‚Äî**she knew he was here too.**



# 2 - THE FIRST CONTACT

At first, it was just a **feeling**‚Äîlike being watched, though he had no eyes to see.

Then came the sounds.

Not through his ears, but inside his skull. A whisper, a pressure, like a static signal forcing its way through the walls of his mind.

*You hear them, don‚Äôt you?*

Marcus tried to ignore it. Hallucinations were common in prolonged coma states. The brain **filled in the gaps**¬†when deprived of sensory input.

Except it happened again.

*Lying in the dark is easier when you stop pretending.*

He tried to scream. His body did nothing.

Then he felt something **pressing against him**‚Äîa sensation without touch, a presence bleeding into his thoughts.

She wasn‚Äôt speaking **in words.**¬†It was more than that. It was **her being**, **her intent**, dripping into his mind like a slow infection.

*You should stop struggling. It makes it worse.*



# 3 - The Doctors thoughts

The doctors **had no idea**.

They thought their cognitive tests were **isolated**, that his responses were his own. But **something else**¬†was happening inside their heads‚Äîsomething **the scans couldn‚Äôt explain**.

Could comatose brains communicate?

There had been **cases**. Patients whose brain activity synchronized despite no direct interaction. Neurologists called it **""shared cortical resonance.""**

A rare phenomenon, **not fully understood**.

Some coma patients **became entangled**, their neural pathways **aligning like two tuning forks**¬†placed side by side. If one moved, the other resonated.

But this was different.

Marcus wasn‚Äôt just **feeling**¬†Elena‚Äôs presence‚Äîhe was experiencing her thoughts, her **mind**, like a parasite burrowing into his skull.

And she **wanted him to know she was stronger.**



# 4 - THE ANIMOSITY GROWS

*You don‚Äôt remember, do you?*

Marcus **did**¬†remember. But not everything.

There had been an accident. A **fall**. That‚Äôs what the doctors had said. Severe brain trauma. Induced coma.

Elena‚Äôs coma had been different.

She had **been put under on purpose.**

The doctors never spoke about it when they were in the room, but he had overheard fragments of conversations. Words like **experimental trials**¬†and **classified funding**.

The doctors were **studying them.**

Elena‚Äôs voice slithered into his mind.

*They lied to you, Marcus. You were supposed to die.*

Something twisted in his gut.

*No. That‚Äôs not true.*

*But you can‚Äôt be sure, can you?*

She was **playing with him**.

She enjoyed this‚Äîthis **one-sided knowledge**, the way she fed him just enough to doubt everything.

Marcus tried to pull away, but her presence clung to him, suffocating.

*They want to pull the plug on one of us, Marcus.*

A beat of silence.

*And it won‚Äôt be me.*



# 5 - THE TORMENT

Marcus felt it first as **a shadow in his mind.**¬†A presence that wasn‚Äôt his own.

Then came the memories.

At first, they were **small things**‚Äîhis father‚Äôs voice calling him as a child, the taste of black coffee, the smell of rain on asphalt.

Then they became **wrong.**

His father‚Äôs voice became deeper. Crueler.

The taste of coffee turned **bitter, metallic, wrong.**

The smell of rain was **rotting flesh.**

He tried to push them away, but they weren‚Äôt his anymore.

They were **Elena‚Äôs.**

She was **giving him her memories**‚Äîbut only the worst ones.

Marcus saw flashes of a hospital room. A screaming voice. Restraints.

He felt **needles piercing into his skin.**¬†The slow press of a ventilator tube being forced into his throat.

He wasn‚Äôt sure if the memory was hers or his.

And **that was the worst part.**



# 6 - THE BREAKING POINT

Marcus felt something shift. A sensation like **pressure inside his skull.**

*You‚Äôre getting weaker,*¬†Elena whispered.

She was **inside him now.**

Not just in his thoughts, but in his **sense of self.**

His memories, his identity, his **Marcus-ness**‚Äîshe was peeling it apart, one layer at a time.

And then, for the first time, he asked himself something he had never considered before.

If she had been here first‚Äîif she had been aware all this time‚Äî

**What happened to the person before her?**



# 7 - THE OVERTURE

*You know what happens when they pull the plug, don‚Äôt you, Marcus?*

Marcus didn‚Äôt respond. He had stopped trying.

He couldn‚Äôt shut her out. Every time he fought, she dug in deeper. Every time he tried to **be himself**, she infected him more.

Instead of resisting, he stayed quiet.

But Elena was **always patient.**

*Tell me, Marcus. What do you think happens to the mind when the body dies?*

He had thought about this before. Of course, he had. But never like this.

Most coma patients **fade**‚Äîbrain activity slows and consciousness dissolves. That was the scientific answer.

But if what was happening between them was real‚Äîif **she**¬†was real‚Äîthen the science was **wrong.**

*Who do you think I was before I met you, Marcus?*

His chest tightened.

*No.*

*Who do you think I replaced?*



# 8 - THE HORROR OF IDENTITY

Marcus had assumed that Elena had been alone before he arrived.

That she had spent a year in silent torment.

But now‚Ä¶ now, he wasn‚Äôt so sure.

The way she spoke, the way she **knew things**, the way she **never let him think too deeply about what came before‚Äî**

She was **hiding something.**

*You don‚Äôt understand, do you?*¬†she whispered. *We‚Äôre never truly alone.*

Marcus‚Äôs mind **fractured.**

He felt his own thoughts **slipping**, his identity peeling away. He was **remembering things that never happened to him.**

A **third**¬†presence.

Not Elena.

Not him.

Something **before her.**

And then, for the first time, **he heard another voice.**

*Help me.*



# 9 - THE PAST PATIENTS

Marcus had assumed the coma ward was **for patients.**

But what if it was something else?

What if it was an **experiment?**

What if he wasn‚Äôt **the second person here‚Äîbut the hundredth?**

The doctors said **one of them was deteriorating.**

But was it him?

Or was it just **his turn?**

He felt his own mind **stretching, fraying at the edges**, like something **pulling him apart**, making space.

*For what?*

For **who?**

*Help me.*

The voice was **weaker than Elena‚Äôs**, but it was still there. **Trapped underneath.**

Buried.



# 10 - THE REALIZATION

Elena was **stealing time.**

She had done this before.

Every person who came before Marcus‚Äî**she had taken them.**

Absorbed them. Eaten them. **Made them part of her.**

And the doctors had **no idea.**

They saw the brain scans. The activity. They saw **signs of life.**

But they never considered **who was inside.**

Marcus **wasn‚Äôt deteriorating.**

He was **being erased.**



# 11 - THE LAST TEST

The doctors were preparing to pull the plug.

They stood over him, discussing **viability, funding and ethical clearance.**

Dr. Vaziri‚Äôs voice was soft. **Almost apologetic.**

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll remove life support from Subject 02.‚Äù

Marcus.

Elena **laughed.**

*It‚Äôs already happening, Marcus.*

He could feel it.

His thoughts were **slower**. His memories were **fading.**

Elena wasn‚Äôt just taking over his mind.

She was **becoming him.**

*No.*

Marcus **pushed back.**

And for the first time, **Elena reacted.**

She wasn‚Äôt expecting resistance.

She had done this before, to weaker people. But Marcus‚ÄîMarcus had been **fighting her**¬†since the beginning.

The pressure **shifted**.

The voice **changed.**

Elena‚Äôs presence **shuddered.**



# 12 - THE SWITCH

Elena **understood her mistake too late.**

She had spent **so long breaking him down**¬†that she never considered what would happen if **he broke her back.**

Marcus did what she had been doing all along.

He reached **inside**.

He let her fill his mind‚Äî**and then he pushed harder.**

Elena **screamed.**

Memories poured into him. **Her memories.**

Hospitals. Strapped to a bed. A voice telling her she was ‚Äúnext.‚Äù The doctors calling her ‚ÄúSubject 01.‚Äù The sensation of **losing herself to someone else.**

She had done it before.

She had been **the victim once.**

Marcus **kept pushing.**

Not just into her mind‚Äî**into what was underneath.**

He heard them.

The ones before.

The ones she had taken.

Their voices **rose**‚Äîa chorus of the dead, the erased, the stolen.

And Marcus did what none of them could.

He **tore Elena apart.**

He didn‚Äôt know if she **died**¬†or if she just‚Ä¶ **disappeared.**

But when it was over, **she was gone.**



# 13 - THE FINAL MOMENTS

The doctors removed life support from **Subject 02.**

The ventilator shut down. The rhythmic hiss of air, the artificial breath sustaining him, was gone.

The heartbeat monitor gave one final, long, piercing **beep.**

Marcus **felt it.**

The slow collapse of his lungs. The silence of his blood, stilled in his veins.

Something **was pulling him away.**

He should have disappeared. He **should have faded**¬†like a dream unraveling at dawn.

But he didn‚Äôt.

The doctors hovered over his bed, waiting for the inevitable. The declaration. The documentation. The cleanup.

And then‚Äî

**The EEG spiked.**

A sharp jolt on the screen, a flicker of electricity where there should have been none.

The room went **silent.**

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù one of the nurses stammered.

The EEG lines pulsed **again.**¬†**Stronger.**

Dr. Vaziri frowned, tapping her pen against the clipboard, staring at the fMRI scan. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs still cortical activity.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs clinically dead,‚Äù another voice said. ‚ÄúBut his brain‚Äî‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt finish.

Because the **activity was growing.**

Marcus was **expanding.**

At first, he thought he was losing himself. The way his mind **stretched**, thinning at the edges.

But it wasn‚Äôt thinning.

It was **reaching.**

Beyond himself. Beyond his body.

Beyond the bed.

The hospital room felt **too small.**

He was outside of it, above it, slipping into the spaces between, like liquid seeping into cracks.

And then‚Äî

He **felt someone else.**



# 14 - THE NEXT HOST

It was faint at first.

A flicker. A presence **like a sleeping mind stirring.**

Down the hall.

A **new patient.**

Another coma patient. **Subject 03.**

They were unaware. Open. **Vulnerable.**

Marcus didn't move toward them. He **flowed.**

The same way Elena had **poured into him.**

Only now, he understood what she had meant.

*We‚Äôre never truly alone.*

There was **always another.**

The doctors remained focused on the EEG, on the impossible readings coming from a brain that **should not be alive.**

They didn‚Äôt notice the change.

They didn‚Äôt notice the **new patient‚Äôs fingers twitch.**

Or the way their eyes moved **underneath closed lids.**

Inside, Marcus **smiled.**

He had won.

But it didn‚Äôt matter anymore.

Because he was **never going to leave.**

1iqmnsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1iqmnsa/ive_went_to_a_women_only_event/,I've went to a women only event,"Hey! So yesterday I've went to an event organized by the lesbian club of the LGBTQ+ association of my city, and I wanted to share my experience so for those who're scared of ""invading"" women only spaces and let them know this, you also belong on those places, don't be afraid.

So, the event started with a talk about sexual health on women, dethroning the myth that lesbians can't contract STDs because ""they don't really fuck"", which is a lie, out of 30 STDs that affect humans, all of them can be contracted on lesbian relationships. It was a really interesting chat, mostly centered on cis women but non the less it was good to know. They've shown a latex towel that covers the vagina and you can do the deed, but it's a bit of a drag to use because with the friction it can move.

I've did a couple of questions about trans women on this regard and they had very little information, but still something so I'm not going to complain about it. At the end of the chat, they were answering questions and listening to suggestions, so I gave them some feedback that since this was an LBTI event, they should be more inclusive with trans and intersex people, giving more information about them and clearly state that having sex with a trans woman won't make you less than a lesbian. The doctor in charge of the talk literally went with ""you're right, you've must have felt a little out of place so I'll take that in mind and research more on it for future talks"" and then she gave me a hug. I felt like I've did something good speaking up about it, I was the only trans girl of the bunch but nonetheless, what if they do another one and more trans girls join to the talk? They also deserve to know safety precautions pre and post op, and it could be a really interesting topic for the cis girls to know, to me it was very educational because I didn't knew most of the things they've talked about.

Moving onto the food, the girls brought a little bit of everything to share with everyone, we've been getting to know us a little and discussing about queer stuff, laughing a lot, most of the laughs where caused by my well timed jokes like, someone asked for some scissors to cut the pizza, but there were any, and I've went ""how funny that this room is full of lesbians but there's no scissors"" and they've burst in laughter. A girl asked me how she can be as funny as me and how I'm so funny, I've told her that the key was listening and timing, if you wait for the right moment, it will caught people off guard always, and I've told her that I've did stand up comedy in the past but I was too socially awkward for that lmao.

Coffee time! My favorite part of the day everyday. I've brought brownies that I've made the day before, they've said that they were exquisite, and I've went with ""I'm a lesbian, of course I'll bake good stuff"" and they've cracked their asses once again (for context, in Spanish people use ""bollera"" meaning dyke because they like eating ""buns"" but it also can mean baker)

In the meantime, a singer-songwriter played some songs she wrote about her lesbian relationships, she was quite good on the guitar to be honest, I envy the people who can coordinate playing and singing at the same time, very beautiful lyrics too. When she was done with her repertoire, she improvised with the guitar along other girl who recited the poem Ode To Aphrodite from Sappho, it was pretty cool since those poems where recited along with music.

Final segment of the day, tupperex!! Drilldos!! We've talked a lot about how to set a good ambiance, making good use of the 5 senses, on how these toys aren't a replacement and how they work. The one in charge of this segment passed me a butt plug and I screamed ""I have one of these! But mine's larger and with a jewel instead of a suction cup, this one is puny!"" and once again, laughter cause I can't stop making jokes on everything lmao. Anyway we saw all the stuff, they've answered some questions and wrapped it up.

My final thoughts: I've had quite a lot of fun, I've felt pretty comfortable and I would repeat this again certainly. Nobody gave me weird looks, I was treated like any other girl and quite frankly, the fear that I've had of not fitting in in my head faded away after a few minutes of being there. I truly enjoyed my time attending to this event, and I really recommend going to women only spaces, you're not invading them, you're welcome like any other woman, so don't be afraid cause you're going to have a lot of fun.",7,1739689438.0,MtF,0,1.0,False

1iqmmnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1iqmmnt/you_will_remember_me/,You Will Remember Me,"# 1 - THE FEAR OF VANISHING

There was nothing in the world Alexander Grayson couldn‚Äôt buy.

He owned cities. He owned industries. He owned people.

But he didn‚Äôt own **time.**

And that terrified him.

He was the **richest man in human history**‚Äîhis empire stretched across continents, his name was printed in every major publication, his face was recognizable from the slums of Mumbai to the penthouses of Manhattan.

And yet, as he sat in his silent, private penthouse, surrounded by artifacts of **forgotten rulers**, his hands trembled.

Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Tesla, the emperors of lost civilizations‚Äî**great men**, once worshiped, now nothing more than names in dusty books.

He pressed his hands against his face, feeling the warmth of his skin.

**One day, no one will remember me.**

**One day, I will be gone.**

The thought made his stomach twist. **All his power, all his wealth, meaningless against the crushing inevitability of time.**

What good was an empire if **history erased you like a wave washing away footprints in the sand?**

What good was being the most powerful man on Earth‚Ä¶ if Earth itself **would one day be dust?**

He needed to leave a mark. Not just a name in a book. Not just a statue in a city square.

He needed something more. **Something permanent.**

Something that **humanity itself could never erase.**



# 2 - THE FIVE SENSES

A question burned in his mind for weeks, consuming him:

**What makes something unforgettable?**

The answer came to him in the silence of his study, surrounded by screens displaying his vast empire.

**Perception.**

Humans only remember **what they can sense.**

Sight. Sound. Smell. Taste. Touch.

Every memory, every human experience, is built upon those five fragile inputs.

**Then that‚Äôs how I‚Äôll make myself immortal.**

Not through legacy. Not through history books.

Through the **senses.**

**I will make sure no human being can ever live without experiencing me.**

It was **so obvious.**¬†So **simple.**

If people could **only see, hear, feel, taste, or smell what I allow them to**, I will be a **god walking among insects.**



# 3 - THE RESEARCH BEGINS

At first, it was an intellectual exercise. A curiosity.

Alexander assembled the **greatest minds in neuroscience, AI, genetic engineering, and sensory augmentation.**

He brought in specialists in **neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, and perception science**‚Äîmany of them unaware of what they were truly working on.

The initial tests were **harmless.**

A subtle AI algorithm that could **implant an image into the subconscious.**A frequency manipulation technique that **could make someone hear whispers that weren‚Äôt there.**A scent-based memory trigger that **could make a person think of a name involuntarily.**

Simple. Subtle. **But effective.**

Within months, his private experiments **yielded results beyond imagination.**

A select group of subjects began reporting **strange experiences.**

A businessman in Tokyo, who had never met Alexander, **dreamed of him every night.**A child in Brazil, who couldn‚Äôt read, **wrote his name on a wall with trembling fingers.**A blind woman in London, for the first time in her life, **described his face.**

It was **working.**

**The human mind was more fragile than anyone realized.**

But Alexander wasn‚Äôt satisfied.

These were small, isolated cases.

He needed **scale.**

He needed **permanence.**



# 4 - THE BREAKTHROUGH

Then, a discovery changed everything.

His lead researcher, Dr. Evelyn Park, had been working on **neural resonance theory**‚Äîthe idea that **certain sensory stimuli could imprint themselves at a biological level.**

""What if we could create a perception that **can't be forgotten?**"" she asked during a private briefing.

Alexander leaned forward, intrigued. ""Explain.""

""A sound, a sight, a scent‚Äîif we engineer them at the right frequencies, at the right neural receptors, it won't just be a memory.""

She hesitated, then pushed forward.

""It will be **a part of them.**""

Alexander‚Äôs breath caught. ""You mean‚Ä¶ they wouldn't be able to unsee it?""

She nodded. ""Not just unsee. **They won't be able to unhear, untaste, or unfelt it either.**¬†It will be as real as the world itself. As real as gravity.""

Something clicked in his mind.

**This was it.**

The key to **true immortality.**

**A presence no human being could ever erase.**

He smiled.

‚ÄúMake it happen.‚Äù



# 5 - THE FIRST TEST

The first test subject was a **volunteer.**

A loyal employee. Young. Bright. **Eager to impress the man who ruled the world.**

Alexander watched from behind a glass wall as the experiment began.

A subtle alteration to **visual perception.**

A single **symbol**¬†embedded in the subject‚Äôs subconscious. A mark‚Äî**Alexander‚Äôs insignia.**

‚ÄúTell me what you see,‚Äù Dr. Park asked.

The subject blinked. ""I see the room.""

""And?""

The subject hesitated. A flicker of **confusion**.

""And‚Ä¶ there's something else. Like a logo, but‚Äî""

They frowned.

""Wait. It‚Äôs in the air. No, it‚Äôs on the table. No‚Äî""

The confusion deepened.

""It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ everywhere.""

The researchers exchanged glances.

""Everywhere?"" Dr. Park asked.

The subject‚Äôs breathing changed.

""Yes. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ stop seeing it.""

They **blinked rapidly. Rubbed their eyes. Looked away.**

But the mark **was still there.**

It had become **part of their sight.**



# 6 - THE HORROR BEGINS

The subject's **panic set in quickly.**

""Wait. Wait, I don‚Äôt‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to see it anymore.""

They **clawed at their face**, as if trying to rip the image from their vision.

Alexander leaned closer. **Fascinated.**

‚ÄúCan you remove it?‚Äù one of the researchers whispered to Dr. Park.

Dr. Park paled.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The **mark was permanent.**

The human mind **had absorbed it.**

Even if the subject lost their memory, even if their brain was damaged, even if they went blind‚Äî**they would still perceive it.**

Forever.

Alexander smiled.

This was **only sight.**

**Four more senses to go.**



# 7 - THE NEXT SENSE

Alexander Grayson watched the first test subject writhe in horror.

They **couldn‚Äôt unsee it.**¬†The mark‚Äîhis mark‚Äî**was burned into their vision, fused into their perception of reality.**

Even when they **closed their eyes**, even when they screamed that they wanted it gone, it remained.

It wasn‚Äôt a memory. **It was a fact.**

And it was **unstoppable.**

But **sight wasn‚Äôt enough.**

Alexander leaned back in his chair, fingers tapping against the polished surface of his desk.

""I want sound next,"" he told Dr. Park.

Her face was pale, still shaken from what had happened to the first subject. But she nodded.

""We've already begun preliminary trials,"" she said carefully. ""If we embed an auditory stimulus at the right frequency, we can create‚Äî""

She hesitated.

""A sound that‚Ä¶ follows people.""

Alexander raised an eyebrow. ""Follows?""

She took a deep breath. ""It won‚Äôt be external. It will be in their **perception of silence.**""

Alexander felt a slow smile curl on his lips.

""Do it.""



# 8 - THE SOUND OF ALEXANDER GRAYSON

The **second test subject**¬†was chosen carefully.

A soldier. Someone trained in high-pressure environments, **resilient to psychological manipulation.**

They placed him in a **soundproof room**, monitored by state-of-the-art equipment.

""We're introducing the stimulus now,"" Dr. Park announced.

A subtle hum, barely noticeable, played **beneath human hearing range.**

Then silence.

""Do you hear anything?"" she asked.

The soldier frowned. ""No. Just‚Ä¶ quiet.""

Dr. Park glanced at Alexander.

""Increase the embedding frequency.""

They turned a dial. A subtle shift, **still imperceptible.**

""Still nothing,"" the soldier said.

Dr. Park nodded at her team. They increased it **one last time.**

The soldier flinched.

""What was that?""

Dr. Park leaned forward. ""Describe it.""

The soldier rubbed his ears. ""I don‚Äôt know. I thought I heard‚Ä¶ something. Like a voice, but not exactly.""

Dr. Park exchanged a glance with Alexander.

""What is it saying?""

The soldier hesitated. His fingers twitched. His jaw tightened.

""I don‚Äôt know,"" he admitted. ""But it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs **in my head.**""

Alexander grinned.



# 9 - THE HORROR OF SOUND

They ended the session.

The soldier was free to go.

But an hour later, he came back.

Pale. Sweating. Trembling.

""I need to talk to someone,"" he said. ""I think I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I think something‚Äôs wrong.""

They let him into a private room. Dr. Park sat across from him, taking notes.

""What‚Äôs wrong?"" she asked.

He swallowed hard.

""I hear it. **All the time.**""

""Even now?""

He nodded.

""Describe it.""

His hands **clenched into fists.**

""It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a whisper. Not words, just‚Ä¶ a presence. A **pressure**¬†in my skull.""

Dr. Park‚Äôs hands **shook slightly**¬†as she wrote.

Alexander leaned forward. ""Can you block it out?""

The soldier‚Äôs eyes **snapped to him.**

And for the first time, Alexander saw **real fear.**

""No,"" the soldier whispered. ""It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ **in the silence.**""

Silence wasn‚Äôt silent anymore.

The moment **the world was quiet**, Alexander was **there.**

Not a voice. Not a sound.

A **presence.**

No one would ever experience silence again without feeling him.

Ever.



# 10 - TASTE AND SMELL: THE SCENT OF ALEXANDER GRAYSON

Alexander **knew**¬†that taste and smell were the most **primal**¬†of human senses.

They were tied directly to **emotion, memory, survival.**

A scent could transport a person back in time.A taste could resurrect **long-buried emotions.**

If he could embed himself into **those senses,**¬†then even people who had never heard of him would feel his **presence in their most private, unconscious moments.**

And so, the next phase began.

The first trials were **subtle.**

A harmless chemical designed to trigger a **neural association**¬†in the **olfactory system.**

The results were **instant.**

* A man in Paris took a bite of his steak and **was overwhelmed with grief**‚Äîfor no reason at all.
* A woman in New York drank her morning coffee and felt an **intense wave of nostalgia.**
* A child in Mumbai started crying **without understanding why**¬†after smelling rain.

None of them knew why.

But when asked to describe the **feeling**, they **all used the same words.**

*""Like someone is watching me.""""Like someone is here.""""Like something is in my head.""*

Alexander was **infecting their memories.**

They weren‚Äôt just **tasting**¬†food.

They were **tasting him.**



# THE SMELL THAT WOULDN‚ÄôT LEAVE

Then came **smell.**

It started small‚Äîa faint, lingering scent in the air.

**Something familiar, yet unplaceable.**

People began noticing it in **strange places.**

* A woman in Berlin swore she smelled **the same cologne**¬†every time she walked into a room‚Äî**even when no one was there.**
* A professor in Beijing **couldn‚Äôt focus**¬†because his office always carried the scent of **something human.**
* A man in Buenos Aires sprayed his apartment with **perfume, air fresheners, bleach‚Äî**¬†but the **smell always returned.**

It wasn‚Äôt **rotting flesh.** It wasn‚Äôt **blood.**

It was **something worse.**

Something **unnatural.**

Something that felt like **it had always been there, waiting.**

People who didn‚Äôt know Alexander **were now haunted by his presence.**

Every time they inhaled, they were **breathing him in.**

The experiment had **surpassed his expectations.**

Now, even if they wanted to forget him‚Äî

**Their own bodies wouldn‚Äôt let them.**



# 11 - THE FINAL SENSE: TOUCH

Alexander saved **touch**¬†for last.

Because **touch was the most intimate.**

Touch was **how people knew they were alive.**

Touch was **what people feared in the dark.**

The experiment was supposed to be simple. A neural implant designed to create **a phantom sensation**‚Äîa calculated imprint on the sensory cortex.

But something **went wrong.**

At first, it was subtle.

One test subject, a journalist, **woke up in the middle of the night, trembling.**

‚ÄúI felt someone in my bed,‚Äù she told the doctors. ‚ÄúI live alone.‚Äù

Another man reported **a presence in his home.**

""Not a shadow. Not a person. Just‚Ä¶ something. **Something touching me when I wasn‚Äôt looking.**""

And it wasn‚Äôt just the subjects.

The **researchers**¬†started feeling it too.

The lead engineer refused to enter the lab at night, claiming that **when he turned his back, something pressed against his spine.**

Dr. Park locked herself in her office after hours, but even then, **she felt it.**

A phantom weight. A hand. A breath on the back of her neck.

""Alexander,"" she whispered one day, voice shaking. ""I think we've made a mistake.""

Alexander just smiled.

He **had already moved past mistakes.**

This was **progress.**



# 12 - THE CONSEQUENCES

Then the **failures**¬†began.

People started **breaking down.**

Subjects clawed at their eyes, screaming that they **couldn‚Äôt stop seeing him.**They plugged their ears, but **his whisper was still inside their heads.**They tried to starve themselves, but even the taste of their own saliva **reminded them of him.**They locked themselves in **brightly lit rooms**, but they still **felt his touch.**

It **spread beyond the test group.**

One day, a security guard was found in the lab bathroom, staring into the mirror, whispering, ""He‚Äôs here. He‚Äôs here.""

A week later, **he cut off his own ears.**

Another scientist **sewed her eyes shut**, sobbing, but it didn‚Äôt help.

""It‚Äôs inside,"" she kept saying. ""It‚Äôs **inside.**""

Alexander watched them all with **fascination.**

The experiment **had escaped.**

His presence **was viral now.**

Wherever there was **silence, he could be heard.**

Wherever there was **darkness, he could be seen.**

Wherever there was **skin, he could be felt.**

People who had never met him, never heard his name, **were experiencing him.**

And then the **worst part came.**

They started **whispering his name**¬†in their sleep.

**Even in places where no technology had reached.**

A tribal elder in the Amazon, who had never left his village, **woke up screaming Alexander‚Äôs name.** A child in a Himalayan monastery wrote **Grayson**¬†over and over in a language he didn‚Äôt speak.

The whispers **spread like a plague.**

Not because people wanted to speak about him.

But because **they couldn‚Äôt stop.**



# 13 - THE FINAL HORROR

Alexander **had won.**

He had accomplished what no emperor, no king, no prophet had ever done.

He had **become a part of the human condition.**

A force of nature.

Not just a memory. **A fact.**

No one could live without **experiencing him.**

No one could ignore him.

No one could **escape him.**

And then, one night, in the silence of his penthouse, he heard it.

A **whisper.**

Not on the news.

Not through the walls.

**Inside him.**

He turned, but there was nothing there.

Then, a gentle **touch**¬†on his shoulder.

His blood went cold.

He was alone.

He had **always been alone.**

But now‚Äî

**he wasn‚Äôt.**



# 14 - THE REVELATION

For the first time, Alexander felt **fear.**

He ran to the mirror, staring at his reflection.

But something was **wrong.**

His face looked **distorted.**

Not changed. Not unfamiliar.

Just **wrong.**

Like a **memory half-formed,**¬†like he was looking at an image of himself that had been **altered without his permission.**

He touched his cheek. It was still warm. **Still real.**

But then the whisper came again.

Not from behind him.

Not from outside.

**From inside.**

His own mouth.

**‚ÄúYou are not alone.‚Äù**

The words **came from his own lips,**¬†but he hadn‚Äôt spoken them.

His breath hitched.

He grabbed his phone, dialing Dr. Park‚Äôs number.

She picked up on the first ring.

""Alexander,"" she gasped. ""It's happening to me too.""

His grip on the phone tightened. ""What do you mean?""

A deep inhale.

Then a sob.

""I can't stop hearing you. I can't stop **feeling you.**¬†Even when I know you're not there.""

A long silence.

Then her voice **lowered.**

""It's happening to you too, isn't it?""

Alexander **felt it again.**

That **presence**¬†in his skin.

That **shadow in his mind.**

Something was **watching him from the inside.**

Something that had **never been there before.**

His hands **shook.**

Had he **been so focused on forcing himself into others‚Ä¶**

**That he hadn't realized something had forced itself into him?**

His heartbeat **pounded in his ears.**

He looked back at the mirror.

And for the first time, he saw it.

Not his reflection.

**Something else.**

Something with his face.

Something with **his voice.**

Something that **wasn‚Äôt him.**

His breath hitched.

Then, softly, in his own voice, the thing in the mirror spoke.

**‚ÄúYou are not enough for yourself.‚Äù**

Alexander **screamed.**

Who knew the real threat to job security wasn't a hungry coworker gunning for your position, but instead an algorithm that doesn't even need coffee breaks? Welcome to 2025, where AI isn't just changing the game‚Äîit's rewriting the rules, players, and scoring system. For startups, it feels like playing chess without half the pieces, especially when AI-powered giants like Palantir and Salesforce are making massive market strides.

**Are Startups Doomed in the AI Era?**

Here's the scoop: Palantir, once a name only insiders knew, is now flirting with valuations that challenge even giants like Salesforce. In an AI-driven world, software heavyweights are pivoting faster than you can say ""machine learning,"" and Palantir is at the forefront with its AI platform making Wall Street swoon. Meanwhile, Salesforce seems to be juggling flaming swords, facing criticism over inconsistent performance‚Äîeven as it dabbles in cutting-edge agentic AI.

**Why Palantir?**

Here's the kicker: Palantir's growth strategy includes partnering (not competing) with industry titans like Microsoft and Amazon. This means while Salesforce is dealing with competition from all sides, Palantir's synergistic approach could be what's giving it the edge.

**Looking Ahead: Who's Winning the AI Race?**

Sure, Salesforce has been the office staple‚Äîlike a trusty stapler‚Äîbut sometimes it's the new kid with the high-tech gadgets who really shakes things up. With Palantir poised for greater heights, are we witnessing the birth of a new tech leader?

**Your Thoughts?**

1iqmkr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1iqmkr4/unpopular_opinion_i_booked_an_interior_stateroom/,Unpopular opinion: I booked an interior stateroom on my upcoming Alaskan cruise. Here‚Äôs why. [LONG ‚Äì TL;DR attached],"TL;DR I booked multiple excursions on every port, costing less than half the price of my whole cruise fare and don‚Äôt plan on being in my room except for sleep. It‚Äôs extremely convenient for my daughter‚Äôs sleep habits and I see balconies as an extra excursion I don‚Äôt use: my room is the same deck as the waterfront, I can go outside in seconds for free and have an entire wraparound balcony. The ship has multiple cabins still open due to shoulder season so we get more space to ourselves without crowds.

. . .

I‚Äôll [26F] be boarding NCL Joy 30MAY this year for a 10-Day Alaskan cruise through Glacier Bay with my four year old daughter. This will be my first Alaskan cruise, my first time sailing NCL, but my fifth cruise overall. 

I suppose you‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôm young and cheap and a newbie but I feel I have pretty good reasons and this side of the opinion isn‚Äôt as talked about. I know everyone says Alaska is THE cruise to ALWAYS book a balcony on for the views. And in a way, yes I do agree and I debated it for some time before choosing my cabin. The cruise itself is right before the shoulder season so I got May prices which were actually pretty cheap, my cruise only cost $2600 for the both of us after taxes, fees, and insurance. I don‚Äôt remember the true value difference anymore but believe it was about $700-900 more for the balcony.

I‚Äôve had balcony rooms twice before on Carnival‚Äôs Horizon (Ocean view) and Royal‚Äôs Harmony (Central Park) ships. Both times I was with friends or family and stepped out on the balcony maybe twice for 10 minutes or so in the beginning. As other people used it, the room always became humid and stuffy. I‚Äôm not a stop and sip on coffee for hours with a book type of person. I‚Äôm a city girl, always on the go and I get FOMO. I want to experience everything at least once. And in Alaska, I definitely wanted to experience EVERYTHING. To do that, I‚Äôm a meticulous planner who uses cruise compasses/freestyle daily‚Äôs to plan out my days by the minute to ensure I can hit everything I‚Äôd like to do, nothing overlaps, and I‚Äôm not running down 10 decks for a show just to rush back up 7 decks for a dance party.

You might think this is insane and who wants to plan this much on vacation but I hate surprises and I like to know what I‚Äôm getting into. I want to know the perfect time to make dinner reservations to ensure I can make this show in time to get good seats. I don‚Äôt want to have to think about what I‚Äôm going to wear or where I should go and waste precious time trying to decide; I already have a plan. I have everything I know I wanna do and hit, and absolutely nothing I don‚Äôt. I heavily research everything and don‚Äôt mind watching excursions or shows in advance to see if it‚Äôs worth my time or if my money could be spent elsewhere in advance. Then on the cruise itself, once all the kinks are unraveled, I‚Äôm in full stress free, vacation mode.

On this particular Alaskan cruise, the itinerary includes long port stops ‚Äì 10 to 14hrs at some, which is why I chose it as other itineraries you‚Äôll only get three or five hours at a port. I plan to fully and thoroughly enjoy the ports rather than the ship itself. I plan to be off the ship all day long. I have excursions booked for every single port, some two excursions, and on Skagway I‚Äôve got three! Only one through the cruise line as I had a $50 MAS credit. All my excursions combined, don‚Äôt even equal to half of the amount I paid for my cruise!! I like to think of myself as an opportunist, and since it‚Äôs only myself and my daughter who will also be occupied and busy being whisked off alongside me, I had more funds to budget for all these excursions and some are entirely self-led or self-made. For examples: in Juneau, I found an excursion I‚Äôm interested in called ‚ÄúWhale Watching, Mendenhall Glacier, and Salmon Bake.‚Äù It cost $418 plus tax. I originally wanted all these things but the glacier visit was only an hour and I really want to visit Nugget Falls but not feel rushed and avoid large crowds of the ship. But also, I found a Salmon Hatchery on the way that outside vendors did not offer and the ship had for $129 pp. So I came up with a solution.

I‚Äôm going to be renting a car, driving to the hatchery first as I imagine there won‚Äôt be crowds, driving towards the glacier after those crowds have started to leave out, then park in a downtown Juneau parking lot next to where the Salmon Bake transport is going to pick me up (since I cannot head there myself, you can only book with a vendor.) Within this time, I will have about a half hour to explore the town of Juneau and try some Russian dumplings before the bake. Do the bake, fill the car on gas if needed, then drive back to AJ dock to board all 2 hours before boarding time. In the meanwhile, I have a whale watching excursion booked for Icy Strait Point a few days later. This self-made excursion will cost me maximum $150 with entree prices included. Plus $88 for the bake with discount! Approx. $238 is significantly cheaper than any excursion I could‚Äôve ever booked through someone else.

I see upgrading to a balcony as a type of excursion in itself. You pay for a view that you could very easily get by leaving your room and walking down the hall, out the door for. I don‚Äôt mean it if my tone comes off condescending here, I‚Äôm aware of the older generation and those with mobility issues and anything else impacting convenience. But as a young, abled person with a curious toddler, the Joy offers amazing amenities such as the wraparound waterfront and the observation lounge. Our room is on deck 8, the same as the waterfront so by simply walking outside, we get an entire wraparound balcony for free. We will be off the ship all day surrounded by water and looking at other beautiful wildlife, taking hikes and such so I honestly do not think we‚Äôll feel confined. Moreso, I‚Äôd been checking the cabin occupancy since I‚Äôd recently paid my final payment, and my ship is maybe only 80% or so full as of today. The joy of shoulder season offers less traffic which means I get more space to myself in these aforementioned areas.

As for the claustrophobia, I‚Äôm a small girl and I‚Äôve never experienced it. I hid in cabinets for fun as a child and neither of us has ever experienced seasickness or carsickness. I have taken my daughter on varies sizes of boats and yatchs traveling and flying with her since she was 6 months old. In land hotels, she will not go to sleep if I‚Äôm not asleep too because she wants to play so I always have to pretend to sleep and wait before I can get my own personal time. This needs to be done in bed, I can‚Äôt hold her and rock her on a balcony then get up to move or I‚Äôll wake her. The less distractions, voices, and light, the better. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she‚Äôs great at putting herself to sleep on her own, but on traveling vacations when we sleep together it is always a hassle. For this reason, I‚Äôm requesting split beds which also allows for more walking space in the room. But even then, my pre-made itineraries are filled to the brim and I imagine by these times I‚Äôll be as ready to fall asleep as her.

The very last reason I chose an interior cabin is because I‚Äôm an Army soldier whose unit is currently placed on prepare to deploy orders this year. I can get called at any time. Every one of my excursions are refundable but I do not pay up charge for refundable cruise fares as a deployment is not a valid reason. In the event I get called, I will only be out one paycheck and can easily cancel everything else up to 7 days of the cruise.

And these are the reasons I‚Äôve chose an interior cabin on my upcoming Alaskan cruise.

My husband and I were pretty stoked by this, as we had largely been ignored by our neighbors since we'd moved in (except for one extremely nosy neighbor who deserves his own reddit post due to all the years of crap he pulled). I'll be honest and say that I'd been disappointed not to be welcomed to the neighborhood with a pie or something like I'd seen in movies, so I thought this was finally happening, albeit a year late.

Sunday evening, we walked over to her house and rang her doorbell. The door was opened by a young lady I didn't recognize, who enthusiastically told us to come in, and that the presentation would begin shortly. Presentation?? Husband and I looked at each other, confused, but sat down on the sofa. A few other women arrived not long after, and our neighbor-lady hostess finally made an appearance, asking everyone if they wanted some wine. Husband doesn't drink, and I don't drink on an empty stomach, so we said no. I'm looking around for the food, any food, but all I see is a projector screen set up in a corner of the room. There's brochures for tropical destinations on the coffee table, as well as business cards that have the face of the lady who opened the door on them. 

Husband had been looking at his phone for a while now, and as I'm about to lean over to talk to him, I get a text notification. It's from him! ""This looks like a set-up. We should go."" the text said. I text back ""I think that's too rude. What if she's serving dinner in a little bit?"" (I was hungry and didn't want to leave empty-handed). He texted to give her 15 minutes, and if there was no food served, he'd make up an excuse for us to leave. I nodded to him. Right after that, the lady who opened the door turned on the projector and started her spiel. 

The long and short of it was she was running some type of travel agent marketing job, where you use your social media to get people interested in traveling to different locales, then you'd get a small commission from the company that ultimately did the actual booking, though it looked like the commission was really just points that could be accrued to go on a trip of your own. She boasted that she gets to travel 4 or more times a year due to how many points she's accrued. You also get a kickback for every new ""travel agent"" you got to sign up to do the same thing, and you get another kickback if that ""travel agent"" recruited someone else, and so on and so forth.

The neighbor-lady host sat there smiling and nodding in agreement, and there wasn't an appetizer in sight, not even finger-food or a coffee table bowl of mints or something. I sniffed the air and realized I didn't smell any food cooking.  Exactly 15 minutes after my husband's last text, his phone rang. He answered it, listened for a minute, looked upset and told our neighbor we needed to leave immediately. She protested that we hadn't heard the rest of the presentation, and should stay until it was over, as it was a very special opportunity for us. He said it was an emergency involving my dad, and apologized for inconveniencing her, but we needed to go NOW.

She looked highly upset, but what could she do? We left and crossed the street to our house. Husband unlocked his car and told me to get in. This made me worried that something had actually happened to my dad. He told me no, there really was no emergency, we just needed to leave for a while to make it look real in case she was watching us from her living room window. We went to Applebee's and finally got some dinner. As for the ""phone call"" he'd received, he'd just set his alarm for 15 minutes and changed his alarm theme to the same tune as his ringtone. Very wise.

Our neighbor-lady host has been cold to us to this day. She put a passive-aggressive note in our mailbox the next day that stopped just short of accusing us of lying in order to leave, stating she'd just been trying to give us a great opportunity, and it had hurt her feelings that we didn't want any of it. Husband is indifferent to it all, and it had already been a year of none of our neighbors really talking to us, so I didn't feel much difference in her cold attitude to us. The only time she's spoken to us since then was once towards the end of my pregnancy a couple years ago, where she randomly shouted across the street that she was so excited for the arrival of our baby. She then went right back to being cold to us, so who knows what's really going on with her?

1iqm7nb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqm7nb,Journal 1: Recap and Highlights,"I started journaling on December 31st, 2024. I didn't wait for january because I wanted to start as soon as I had a journal dedicated to writing about my life. I was supposed to get it earlier, but family stuff happened. I also wanted to separate my journaling with New Year's resolutions, I was in it for the long haul. throughout this journal, I averaged about 3-4 individual sides per day.

at first, you can see that my handwriting was messy, as it usually is, but I refined it so that I could fit other words on the top so If I made mistakes or needed to add something I always had available space. I chose the pages shown based on how much I like the doodle and or story belonging to it. I decided that every month I'd switch from pen to pencil to paper etc. to have variety and make the separation of moths easier to see.

when I described myself in my head about journaling I usually thought ""I try to journal daily"" but I'm not trying, I never missed a day, and even when I had barely any motivation to write I always made it a priority to at least have one page full and 1 doodle for 1 day. so I have and will be writing daily. The doodles in my journal relate to the events in my life on that page, when I look back I'll have a better time remembering the events based on the doodles I've made.

when first starting, the people who gave the journal to me wanted me to fill it out by the end of the year, it took me around a month and a half to complete the book, which is cool and all but I had no other journal to switch to, I wasn't panicking but I felt more and more uneasy as I had less and less paper, luckily, I bought three new journals and one other gifted by a family member so that I won't be in the same place I am now, having to limit my writing to just two individual sides of a page.

my goal for journaling is to remember the past, I wish I had started sooner, so many memories I would have loved to go back to. journaling also makes time move slower, I'm able to go back and ""see"" the past. I also want to create a collection of journals.

To document my life with the journal I had to carry it around with me at all times, I made a satchel to hold it, going to make a newer one that doesn't need my belt to stay attached. the journal being close to me also helped my motivation to write.

We‚Äôre CodeManu & Endless Coffee, a small indie team working on Tinkerlands, a survival-adventure game where you explore a procedurally generated magical archipelago, build a settlement, craft gear, and battle monsters - solo or in co-op with friends!

If you joined Steam Next Fest in October 2024, you might remember our demo! We‚Äôre incredibly proud that it was so warmly received, with 4,000+ players online and a spot in the festival‚Äôs top 15 most played demos!üéâ

Since then, we‚Äôve been hard at work on the Early Access version, and we‚Äôre excited to confirm that **it‚Äôs coming on Steam in Q2 2025!** Until then, our [\~6+hours demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3185760/Tinkerlands_Demo/) is still available, so feel free to try it out while we keep expanding the world of Tinkerlands!



We often get asked - **what makes the Early Access version even more fun?** 

Just like in the demo, you‚Äôll start as a shipwrecked survivor on a procedurally generated island. But this time, survival is just the beginning! You'll need not only to gather resources, craft weapons and build your own settlement, but also farm, fish, cook and help locals with their requests - all while uncovering the mysteries of the archipelago. 

Your ultimate goal now? Repair your ship, sail to new islands, battle unique enemies and bosses, and rescue your captain - if you ever want to escape this cute yet dangerous world!

üëÄ Check out our latest trailer showcasing Early Access features: [https://youtu.be/PWOflbS19Ow](https://youtu.be/PWOflbS19Ow)



**So, where are we now?**

We‚Äôre currently deep in development, fine-tuning mechanics and adding new features to make Tinkerlands as fun and immersive as possible:

‚úîÔ∏è Single-player is nearly complete! All new content has been added, visuals have been significantly improved, and everything just needs final polishing.

‚úîÔ∏è Multiplayer is our biggest challenge - debugging co-op feels like a boss fight of its own! But we‚Äôre making steady progress and are on track to have it ready for Early Access in Q2 2025.

First of all, thank you for this group! I have been reading many success stories here that led me to experiment on carnivore diet for the past 7 months.

I took statin for 7 years before I knew about carnivore diet. I stopped taking it when I started carnivore diet. I noticed many health improvements during my carnivore journey - inflammation 90% gone, arthritis less frequent, less getting sick and recovered much faster, brain not foggy anymore, etc.

My usual rotating diets are: Black coffee with butter, eggs, beef with salt (and spices sometimes), fish, lamb and chicken. 80/20 meat to fat ratio. Half-Day Fasting twice a week.

Recently, I did my blood test and the cholesterol readings went up by around 20\~30% (for LDL and TG as well). My previous total cholesterol reading was around 590, 6 months ago. And my recent test results are:

After fasting for 18\~19 hours:

**Total Cholesterol:** 750.2

**HDL:** 68.83

**LDL:** 641.9

**TG:** 190.43

Extra Info: I am 38 years old. Done CAC Test 4 months ago and the result is 0. Kidney and liver test all good.

I am also suspecting that I have Familial Hypercholesterolemia as my parents, aunties and uncles all have high cholesterol and history of heart diseases.

I have read about how cholesterol is not bad, LDL is not bad, large vs small buoyant LDL, living longer, etc. However, most of the examples were using results reading that are not as high as 600+.

So, am just curious, does anyone here or do you know anyone who has similar cholesterol reading as mine that are practicing carnivore diet, and how do they do now? Just want to check if I am doing OK. If not, do I need to change something to improve myself.

In particular, my mouth has been getting drier by the day since it started just three weeks ago. 

My eyes are also getting drier but for now, I am coping with just artificial drops. But the mouth is a big one because I can feel that my teeth are feeling sensitive already upon waking. 

What are some measures I can take? Shockingly, pilocarpine and Evoxac are not available in my country (Australia) so I can't even ask my doctor for a prescription. 

  
I currently use oracoat xylimelts at night and xylitol drops during the day when needed. However, the oracoats aren't working as well as they did in the beginning. 

I also avoid sugar and dairy and try to eat a low carb diet. I brush using fluoride toothpaste twice or three times a day if I have lunch. I also oil pull with coconut oil every night. 

I take fish oil, magnesium, vitamin d, b, c, probiotics, propolis, s acetyl l glutathione, ALA, hyulronic acid, asthaxanthin. 

  
Should I be pushing for something like Plaquenil out of desperation? I know there's no evidence that it slows gland destruction but I am desperate. 

If I go to a dentist, what should I ask for? Some of my teeth already have enamel erosion due to near daily coffee and alcohol intake. 

I am 34M and it is so hard to even try to get cyclosporine prescribed. Apparently a Schirmer's of 2mm and TBUT of 6s is not enough. I actually need to exhibit signs of corneal damage which is just mind boggling. Isn't it sort of too late by then? I might just buy it privately but I'm not sure if that is even possible.

I can feel my salivary glands are somewhat swollen and just did an ultrasound a few days ago. I'll get the results next week hopefully. The rheum said I can do a lip biopsy after that if it looks suspicious. BTW, all my bloods are NEGATIVE. 

  
The worst thing is just sitting around whilst my eyes and mouth get drier and drier by the day. I've also lost my sense of taste and smell over the past few days too. It's a struggle and I am losing hope. 

  
Furthermore, even if the ultrasound/biopsy come back positive for Sjogren's, what then? I doubt my rheum will give me plaquenil unless there is organ symptoms/neuropathy involved. And to add cherries on top, I have bloating, fatigue and trouble sleeping. ",2,1739687135.0,Sjogrens,0,1.0,False
1iqm2xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iqm2xe/how_to_deal_with_an_emotionally_abusive_but/,How to deal with an emotionally abusive but manipulative/gaslighting ex (40M) co-worker/senior? (30F),"I am currently pursuing a specialist degree in medicine in a place far away from home/ family and had an extremely volatile clandestine relationship with a certain senior in the same department since the last 1.5 years. We are from two different religions in a conservative country. Maybe finally openly talking about it somewhere will provide me with come catharsis and closure. 

Before this 'situationship', I was in a stable and relatively happy long term relationship of 7 years with a former batchmate which had become long distance for 3 years with absolutely no sense of direction and no future plans which had led to a mutual break-up. I was loved, protected and so sheltered in this relationship throughout most of my 20s that I wasn't exposed to manipulative men or situationships in general. Being the oldest child and daughter, I've always had to be very responsible and wasn't ever into flings/affairs. I don't know if it's relevant, but I'm mostly introverted and a bookworm with zero social media presence. I'm considered pretty/hot and always have had a lot of people approach me despite my reclusiveness. This guy (1 year senior at work) became good friends with me when I first joined the dept and was extremely kind, helpful with advice and seemed like an overall good person. He had even met my then boyfriend once or twice when he came to visit and they were friendly (he is friendly to everyone). 

This man had a reputation of being a playboy which we heard of from other people, but he would constantly deny it himself. He is well-read and well-spoken, extremely fit and charming but has major depressive episodes. He had tried to flirt with me when I first joined but I had dismissed it as I didn't see him that way, just as an older brother kind of way. After the breakup, we got closer and it started off on an extremely volatile note with flirting, emotional outbursts and him coming to my room to console me at night promising not to do anything sexual but trying to force his way into penetrative sex. I broke it off and spent the next 3 weeks trying to avoid all contact while he constantly tried to gaslight me at work saying that I was an idiot thinking a man wouldn't want sex coming to a woman's room at night. At work I absolutely cannot avoid him because we are a small dept of 8 people in 3 rooms who have to work closely for 3 years. I only told my same age batchmate about the issue because I was having emotional breakdowns outside of work everyday and he was supportive and told me to avoid him as well. 

Now when I write about it, I realize what a massive idiot I was for forgiving him and going back into whatever it was back then. In my defense, I had never met someone as manipulative and charming as this. We would have these cycles of extremely good days and then weeks of no-contact on and off for 1.5 years (while living and working in the same hostel) because he would suddenly do something so incongruous and emotionally/sexually abusive that I couldn't process it. Emotional/verbal abuse included shouting at me for random things, calling me names and calling me fat (my BMI is 19), trying to convince me that I'm extremely stupid and that I'm luckly to be wherever I am right now, that I'm lucky and so very privileged to sleep with him while he can go out and get any girl he wants, listing off all the women texting him and asking him out (which may have been true, I cannot verify), talking about his long list of previous sexual escapades and affairs with smart and beautiful women who still kept trying to get him back (some of this I can confirm as I knew one of them). He has openly shared his history of non-commitment and cheating with most of his previous exes, except for 1-2 women who he deeply loved and had wanted to marry. He made me write parts of his thesis with no credit (the other half was written by his platonic ex). I provided him with notes, books, food and emotional support throughout his final exams and edited and submitted articles for him to research journals (again no credit). He's taken expensive concert tickets from me without paying for it and then spent the entire concert with his male friends away from me. He has never cooked for me, never given me gift (except for candy), never taken me out on a date, never told me explicitly that he loves me. 

He'd constantly say mean and hurtful things, say that I've bad or no friends, and if I tried defend myself he'd say that I AM THE EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE ONE who should be saying sorry to him. I would cook special meals for him, get him little gifts and notes and beg him to take me out (he never did). Sexual abuse included forcing sex acts on me I did not want to perform and apologizing profusely later saying he couldn't hear me saying no or seeing me cry and that he cared for me so much. And after every single episode, I would avoid contact for a few weeks and then forgive him and take him back (yes, only on writing this down am I beginning to see the extent of my 'doormatness').

On the good days, he'd build me up with compliments and career advice and he has even excitedly taken me home to visit his mother and family on two occasions with an overnight stay. He told me I was the first girl to have even bestowed this honour on (probably because I was the biggest doormat out of 30 other women). I've met a few of his old friends and even video called with his sisters who were friendly. On certain days when I was upset or sad for other reasons, he has come to my room with candy, taken a novel off the shelf, held me in his arms like a child while reading me a story till I laughed. He has danced with me to random songs at 2 am, watched so many movies and shows together, read books together. He has always supported my love for outdoorsy activities and reading. He has confided in me his experience of childhood abuse (by his estranged father) and the insane amount of hustling he had to do in the last 10 years to keep his family financially afloat. He has met my parents twice as a friend and speaks highly of them. 

The one condition of this situationship was not going public with him at the hospital and city we lived in currently. I wasn't allowed to tell anyone and neither did he. So I've had to endure 1.5 years of this clandestine affair without the support of friends or family because I cannot tell anyone I'm with him in the first place. He said that this is to actually protect my reputation as being associated with his playboy/ fuckboy image would harm me later in case it did not last and also because the inter-religious pairing would invite outside hate (that is a possibility). He would also never guarantee me comittment and would constantly call and text with his exes who he said were now platonic friends.  Despite this, he assured me that he'd never slept with anyone else in all the time we'd been together (considering all the hurtful stuff he m constantly hurls at me, I believe this is true). He said I'd have to accept all these parts of him and his platonic friendship with his exes if I wanted to be a part of his life. 

The last fight occurred on Feb 14th, where I asked him if we could actually go out for a coffee date outside in the evening. He said yes, then ditched me to go and party with his friends the whole night while calling me once late at night. The next day he said he doesn't believe in valentine's day and we could go out later someday. So I just told him to be merciful for once and just end it. Just cut it off and end it forever. That I was tired. He asked me if I'm sure. I said yes.

This happened in the early morning and then I had to deliver a presentation in the same dept later in the day in front of him which I completely bombed because of the emotional state I was in (and which I cannot tell anyone about). He was giving me this look of pity the entire time and shaking his head. After that I was forced to stay the whole day and watch him interact with everyone else cheerfully, while he was congratulated and feted by others for passing his final exams sometime back. He went out on a picnic with his friends later like nothing happened. 

I've endured this before with a stoic unemotional face at work pretending nothing affects me. I cannot be strong anymore when it's killing me inside. His tenure is about to be over and he was previously considering leaving this hospital but now suddenly he has applied for a one year extension in the same dept. I have pleaded with him to just leave, to be kind to me for once, but he just said that he cannot base his career decisions on my emotional state. And that he would definitely date and see other women here, the same place where I'll be forced to stay 1 more year till I finish my degree. 

TLDR - Was in an emotionally and sexually abusive secret 1.5 year situationship with co-worker and senior who is willingly extending his tenure at our place of work while I'm forced to stay here for my degree.

My dad was not in my life growing up. He was mentally unstable, and an addict (alcohol & pills mostly.) This left me living with my mom, who was also unstable, and caused many traumatic experiences growing up. I know my dad wanted to be in my life, but between his own issues and my mom constantly moving us around with new men my whole upbringing, and hating my dad, it never happened . 
Well fast forward, im two weeks from turning 15, my dads wife had found me on social media a while back. I grew up wishing he could be in my life and not understanding it, my mom would say he didnt want me, that he left me, all this and that. and my moms taken off somewhere so i dont know what else to do. I ask to come to there house. 
Over the year that i lived with him, it was not like my child self imagined it would be. He was a severe alcoholic, he would get agressive or so drunk hed bump into the coffee table and pass out on the floor for the rest of the night. He would get angry with me, he tried to lunge at me once out of anger, but hed also tell me how much he missed me and how hes so happy im back in his life. There was a point he slit his wrists and came in to show me. He told me once that if he lost me again he doesnt know what hed do. Hed tell me about his plans to kill himself, and that hed wait until my youngest brother was 18 (he was 4/5).  I never told anyone bc i was already so traumatized from both parents so id just sit there and listen without knowing what to do about it. 
Well, him and i got in a pretty bad fight one time. Over stupid stuff, i wanted to stay a few extra days with a friend, he thought i was lying about what i was doing. Fight ensued. I left and went back to my moms. We didnt speak much after that. I think i got rid of his number too bc i had gotten a new phone. He wasnt the dad i was expecting, and i just wanted out for a while. 
I went to collect some things from his house, he was clearly very sad. I didnt say much, i was so used to being in and out of houses i was just on autopilot at that point. 
Two weeks after i turn 16, he hangs himself. In the shed, above all the rest of my belongings. He was blackout drunk. No note. Nothing. I found out while staying at a friends house, got a text from his wife and then we spoke on the phone. She didnt want to tell me how he died, but i knew in my heart. She did confirm what i thought. She gave me gruesome details i couldve lived without. This isnt even all the details but the entire situation was traumatizing and i dont think anyone would want extra details anways. 
I still struggle with this, because i KNEW he had plans to do it one day. I KNEW he was depressed, but how was i supposed to help  when i was already in such a bad place mentally due to years of prior trauma, and dealing with a very unstable mother. I left, i did the one thing he had mentioned would break him. Ive even had someone say that yeah that probably was the main reason. It makes me feel so much guilt. And rationally i know if someone already has a plan in mind that its hard to change that, and that his decisions were his own. I dont have parents. I have a dead dad and a mother who i always had to be responsible for. I didnt ask for any of this. What do i even do or say. I KNOW all of the logical answers. I know how to cope and what to do to distract myself. Ive been through years and years of therapy. Ive done the meds and the coping skills and all of that. But at the end of the day the feeling is still there. I guess there's no point to this post really but i feel so alone. ",36,1739687078.0,confession,44,0.85,False

After Soapy‚Äôs little outburst, Tobby was silent the rest of the night. The normal guys came soon after and checked if they were alright before swapping the goods. They even took the ones that got damaged, not too many broken bottles to worry about. Still, silence clung to Tobby. Not a word left his mouth and he communicated when he had to with short nods at best.

It was well past midnight meaning night-kin and other odd-ball nocturnals were active like Tobby. He had an apartment out here, several floors up in one of the neighborhood‚Äôs endless brick tenements. Buildings as tall as cheap trainers' bricks could be stacked, packed to the gills with studio apartments and narrow hallways. To Tobby, his was just a place to sleep, his badge of ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô as an adult.

The mag lock beeped and the door swung open, pushing it with his shoulder as he trudged inside. The clinking sack full of his pay now hung on a wall hook next to the door like he would a coat if he didn't keep leaving it at his mom‚Äôs house. 

He saw well enough in the dark thanks to the moonlight and light pollution bleeding in from his balcony door. The space between four bare brick walls was the most expensive thing he‚Äôd ever owned‚Ä¶ a dark, empty apartment. A small studio one with the illusion of rooms provided by creative faux archways divvying up the space. He tried to be invested in this place but he couldn't bring himself to be. The couch, the TV, the tiny kitchen, and the bathroom‚Ä¶ they were ‚Äòhis‚Äô but they felt so empty‚Ä¶ cold. Like a soulless hotel one stayed at when they missed a flight.

He didn‚Äôt bother with the lights, electing to simply drag himself to his ‚Äòbedroom‚Äô. Closet, dresser, and bed. Also his, but feeling just a little warmer than the rest of the place. He pulled the suspenders off his shoulders, leaving them to hang at his sides before he just fell forward crashing onto the sheets. He finally managed to groan and deflate. His arm and legs were left hanging off the sides as he couldn't be bothered to push himself further up.

Tobby was shutting down, unfortunately, gravity didn‚Äôt care, and he slooooowly slid off the bed until he lay limp on the floor, groaning louder. A hand reached up and felt around for those loose sheets before pulling them down to him. *‚ÄòClose enough,‚Äô* he thought.

Somehow being wrapped in a blanket on a hard floor felt more ‚Äòright‚Äô than anything else right now, like this is what he needed to coax the shadow of sleep. Sadly it was not appeased. He could have guessed it had been what?‚Ä¶ half an hour? Before he surrendered to the ancient question: *‚ÄòAm I asleep yet?‚Äô* Tobby‚Äôs eyes opened with a groan. Nope‚Ä¶ still conscious.

In the deafening near silence, his ears flicked about, picking up every little sound penetrating the walls and windows. The old shi next door left her TV on‚Ä¶ cars going down the street outside, the hum of distant ships passing overhead, and more. The far-off gunshots, the white noise, the thrumming AC, the gunshots, the 15s bickering over food, the gunshots, the ripping of metal, the breaking of glass, the-

Tobby sat up, his dull tired gaze unchanging as he slowly reached up and pulled his tall ears down flat atop his head. It was a futile effort but it dulled the noise for now. He wasn‚Äôt thinking‚Ä¶ just doing what felt ‚Äòright‚Äô. And what felt right right now was grabbing the loose sheets and taking them to the living room 10ft away. He looked down at the rug between his couch and coffee table and just followed the feeling. He laid down. The rug was a bit softer than the wooden floor, and with faint memories of camping in the living room as a kitten, he formed a blanket cocoon in the nook. It felt‚Ä¶ better. At least his mind said so, while parts of his body protested the lack of support, if this was what the shadow of sleep wanted, it was what it was going to get. 

He pulled the blanket snugly around himself, especially over his head to keep those tall ears pinned down to mute the outside world. This is what he nearly died for‚Ä¶ paying rent on a cold, empty apartment. The floor was nice tho‚Ä¶

‚Äî

Meanwhile half a quadrant away‚Ä¶
On the northern borders of Kalikai space‚Ä¶
On the inter-house resort world of Hyal-4‚Ä¶
On a sunset-blanketed beach‚Ä¶
With a very colorful drink in hand‚Ä¶ Was Captain Roka.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs good,‚Äù he said as the service droid following hovered around and deposited the ornate and in his opinion over-teched beach chair in the sand. He dismissed the machine and took a moment to scan up and down the beach. Nothing but him, pink palms, white sand, and the vibrant orange sun reflecting off the sea. ‚ÄòBeautiful~‚Äô

He worked hard for this, having hammered away at his mission schedule until there was a well-deserved two-month gap, allowing him to do as he pleased. It was going to be nothing but him, his condo, all the fruity drinks he could want, and basking his blue scales in the toasty light of this world‚Äôs star. 

He sat down, reclined, adjusted his tail just right, and took a deep breath. The setting sun meant the tide was going out and pulling inland wind with it. Warm light on his scales, cool wind passing around his ear fins. Breathe in‚Ä¶and let it all out with a very‚Ä¶very long sigh as he melted. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ This is perfect, the wind, the water, the su-‚Äù

***BEEP!!....BEEP!!....BEEP!!***

‚Äú-son of a bitch!‚Äù He sat up looking down at the flashing red light on his wrist. With a single tap of the pinky claw of his drink-holding hand, his bracer-like assistant decloaked. The gleaming brass-plated device flashed an alert that he had an incoming call. It could have been something nice, but his heart sank the moment he saw it was interplanetary. Most would just send a message, but only work would burn money on a live hyperlane call. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going‚Ä¶to murder someone‚Ä¶‚Äù Roka groaned before tapping the accept call button. ‚ÄúCaptain Roka cannot be reached right now, he is in the middle of a very important and highly classified mission-‚Äù

‚ÄúNice try Captain Roka, but you‚Äôve already used that one.‚Äù House Liaison Hakar said with a mirthful tone. A voice-only call it seemed, at least that meant he didn‚Äôt need to get dressed. ‚ÄúAre you busy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already know the answer to that‚Ä¶‚Äù Roka lamented and quickly downed the remainder of his semi-frozen rainbow concoction, he'd need a drink for this.

‚ÄúHmm, yes. I can hear the waves and sky rats in the background. So do you want the good news or the bad news first?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust rip the scales out already‚Ä¶‚Äù Roka said, holding the bridge of his snout.

He could almost sense the eyes being rolled on the other side of the call. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being recalled for a very delicate political matter. And before you say it-‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did the prince put his dick in this time?‚Äù The two said in unison though with very different tones. It was a well-known fact that the prince of the House of Love was, is, and always will be a raging xenophile. So when someone says ‚Äòdelicate political matter‚Äô seven times out of ten it means the prince wants to get his claws on the most recent race to pique his interest.

Both Lincal sighed on both ends of the call, but Liaison Hakar was the one to continue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing like that‚Ä¶ yet. This one is more of a xenotarian crisis than anything else. Normally I‚Äôd respect your vacation time and the House of Love would handle this themselves, but everyone‚Äôs favorite ambassador is bad at math.‚Äù

‚ÄúI take it the council messed up?‚Äù Roka asked.

‚ÄúBadly,‚Äù Hakar answered.

‚ÄúAnd how much power did Prince Azzi give Del-zi this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough to violently miscalculate fleet readiness for such an issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how badly did his majesty‚Äôs 34th littlest brother miscalculate?‚Äù There was no pleasant answer to that question.

‚ÄúVery‚Ä¶ He proclaimed to the whole community that the houses would have a fleet deployed to the root region of this crisis within two months.‚Äù

Roka coughed for a moment. ‚ÄúTwo months!?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's what I said when this got pushed onto my desk. But as per usual we have to make it happen somehow, a delay of even a single day will put a scratch on the flawless image the galaxy has of us, then they might start getting uppity again.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you called me on my first vacation in five cycles because‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause after running the numbers, none of the houses will be able to field the required fleet and get it there in time on their own. Thus the princes and princesses have chosen to task reputable inter-house members to handle this. AKA, you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn. I knew being good at my job would come back to bite my tail‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we all. Now I‚Äôd give you the usual thinly veiled threats about how generously funded you are and how you‚Äôre on such good terms with all the Princes, but I‚Äôm going to give you the dignity of skipping that part.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo please, do threaten my free reign to hop around Lincal space as I like, I might be out of the job long enough to take my vacation,‚Äù Roka grumbled hoping the sarcasm came across.

‚ÄúBut that might make you happy~ and we all know we can't have that now can we?‚Äù The liaison jested before continuing. ‚ÄúYou, your ship, and select personnel from each house will serve as the diplomatic arm of the expedition, while the House of War cruiser and support vessels that will arrive soon after shall be the ‚Äòpolicing/militant‚Äô arm of the mission.‚Äù

Captain Roka just reclined back in his beach chair electing to enjoy the 0.2% of his vacation time he got to use while taking this call. ‚ÄúAny mission details I should know about right now? I haven‚Äôt been watching the news lately for obvious reasons.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already sent you a copy of the briefing and dossiers on individuals you need to pick up by certain dates. As for the issue‚Ä¶ ehhh.‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt see it but it was easy to imagine Hakar doing the so-so nod with his head. ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äôs been shaken up by an unexpected smuggling spree again. Some unuplifted race is likely being taken advantage of at the edge of community space and the black markets are being flooded with new guns, drugs, and diseases.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt this happen 30 or 40 cycles ago with the Shasians or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but at least it's not the Cavineri refugee crisis again.‚Äù

‚ÄúSmall blessings‚Ä¶‚Äù Roka muttered. That little incident was over 200 cycles ago‚Ä¶ was he even alive back then? Wow, just having to ask that made him feel old.

‚ÄúIronically the root of the smuggling networks traces back to Salafor of all places‚Ä¶ Ironic isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the‚Ä¶ what was it‚Ä¶?‚Äù Roka tapped a claw on his chair trying to remember.

‚ÄúShasian homeworld.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, lovely. I really wanted to trade my beachside condo for grass, clay, and more grass in every direction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey do have some inland seas. If you're lucky they might be willing to sell you a property where you can make more of those fruity drinks you like so much.‚Äù

Roka held up the wrist with his assistant on it and squinted at the screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called a prism blaster and so help me it's a manly drink and I will throw anyone who says otherwise out of an airlock.‚Äù

‚Äú...I never said it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

A moment of silence followed but the squint stayed. ‚ÄúYou were thinking it‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou have no proof and you don‚Äôt know where I live. Please get your affairs in order and report with your crew to the rendezvous points as soon as possible.‚Äù Beep~

 He hung up. As expected really but Roka still wanted to sigh about it, just to feel a little better. He went to take a sip from the glass still in his off-hand and was reminded just how empty it was. ‚ÄúDamn it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äî

‚ÄúRun it by me again‚Ä¶?‚Äù Tobby requested trying to stretch himself just right and undo the little kinks sleeping on the floor left in his back. Just as he predicted, sleeping on the floor was paradoxically both the most and least comfortable way he‚Äôd ever slept. Cozy and unique enough to fall asleep, but lacking any kind of support to keep one from hurting when they woke up.

Around him, Noah‚Äôs impromptu ship parking lot was being used to retrofit the library truck. The holes were being patched and painted over, metal panels were being installed along the inside and behind the seats, and-

Tobby backstepped as a rather rotund darker-skinned human tossed the now former ‚Äòcenter console‚Äô out the passenger side door. ‚ÄúPlenty of space to stand around in ‚Äòere now boss man. Still wanna go with the door idea or leave it open?‚Äù

Noah pondered for a moment before yelling back, ‚ÄúYeah, put the door in. It'll keep the AC in and stop some bullets.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it.‚Äù The human returned a thumbs-up gesture out the door before waddling back inside.

‚ÄúThanks, Baba!‚Äù and Noah turned back to Tobby. ‚ÄúA‚Äôight, so, it's not as bad as it sounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds pretty bad‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay it sounds bad, but as your very safety-conscious and OSHA-compliant employer let me tell you why it's not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Osha?...‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry about that.‚Äù he waved the thought away with the clipboard in his off-hand. ‚Äú We talked with the guys at the other end of the delivery and agreed after last night‚Äôs attack some changes are in order.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say‚Ä¶‚Äù Tobby squinted. ‚ÄúI could have died.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you didn't~‚Äù Noah shrugged, pushing an earnest smile.

Tobby squinted harder.

‚ÄúOkay, sassy bitch mode it is today‚Ä¶‚Äù He said scribbling something on the clipboard. ‚ÄúLook, if it were up to any other boss you‚Äôd be out there in a shot-up truck waiting to get shot at again, but with me, I got you some safety features,‚Äù he said, putting his clipboard arm around Tobby‚Äôs shoulders and doing a sweeping wave gesture with the other. ‚ÄúAnd just ‚Äòcause those safety features also help secure my ‚Äògifts‚Äô to the Shasian race is just a happy bonus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm so grateful you‚Äôre making everything but me slightly more bulletproof.‚Äù Tobby grumbled before prying Noah's arm off himself.

‚ÄúRight, so once we‚Äôre done giving the truck the old B-17 treatment, you and Soapy can continue to carry out deliveries like normal, except this time...‚Äù He pulled out a little pen-shaped device and gave it a few clicks making the tip flash a bright green light. ‚ÄúOur guys on the other end will signal you with this here light.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? Do you want us to start using smoke signals next?‚Äù

Noah shrugged ‚ÄúIf it works, it works, man. Just assume anyone out there who doesn‚Äôt flash the light is out to kill you and bail. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I get it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm more just wondering why you didn‚Äôt pick a different swap location instead.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCause that would take too long, I‚Äôm already behind schedule on deliveries as is staying back to supe up the truck for you guys. We can get a new location picked next time I get back. Just have faith in the armored truck kay?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Tobby sighed looking back at the truck again, wincing a bit as a metal grinder could be heard from within, making his ears go flat until he pulled out the noise-canceling studs and put them back on his ears. ‚ÄúI am getting so much use out of these things‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGlad you like ‚Äòem, I was considering starting to sell them alongside the gun shipments as a little bonus. A very ‚Äòwould you like fries with that‚Äô approach, but they do cost a fair bit more than everything else I have‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Tobby slowly raised a hand with a finger ready to ask a question‚Ä¶

‚ÄúFries are diced up and deep-fried potatoes‚Ä¶‚Äù

The hand slowly went back down‚Ä¶then slowly came back up.

‚ÄúPotatoes are a starchy root‚Ä¶‚Äù

The hand went-

‚ÄúYes, your physiology can handle them, just not in high amounts. You can probably eat like...1 potato‚Äôs worth in a sitting if I had to guess. No, I do not have one on me, Yes I will ship one in if it'll keep you from asking more questions about them.‚Äù

Tobby glanced around a bit, beginning to wonder if humans had predictive powers, before he decided to test that and bring the hand up again.

Noah just looked at the questioning hand, then back at Tobby, then back at the hand. ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs where vodka comes from.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat isn't what I was gonna ask at all!‚Äù Tobby‚Äôs mental image of psionic humans crumbled with every question.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ shoot.‚Äù

This was harder for Tobby to ask. ‚ÄúI... I umm‚Ä¶‚Äù he glanced around having not wanted to ask Noah this, but here he was. ‚ÄúHow do you‚Ä¶‚Äù He scratched at his neck and tugged at his collar a little as he felt his pulse jump. Eye contact became quite hard quite fast. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think Soapy‚Äôs m-mad at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúMad at you as in you looked at you longer than usual and you started jumping to wild conclusions, or mad at you like you forgot her birthday even though she never told you when it was?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat last one sounds awfully specific‚Ä¶‚Äù Tobby said before shaking his head a bit to focus. ‚ÄúMad at me like there was a breakdown of communication and I‚Ä¶ may have insulted her‚Ä¶ somehow.‚Äù

Noah held the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúPlease for the love of God tell me you didn‚Äôt accidentally say something super racist to her face without realizing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?! No!‚Äù Tobby denied, crossing his arms over and over taking a step back.

Noah gave a small sigh of relief. ‚ÄúOh good, what did you say then?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell..‚Äù he tried to think of how to word this. ‚ÄúWith context and lack of a better way to say it‚Ä¶ she said ‚Äò well screw me, we just survived a drive-by‚Ä¶ aaand‚Ä¶‚Äù Toby paused awkwardly, tapping his fingertips together. ‚ÄúI may have said ‚ÄòI‚Äôd rather not‚Äô. And she got really mad‚Ä¶ and I'd like her to not be.‚Äù He smiled sheepishly.  

Noah blinked and had to lean on a nearby crate, ‚ÄúDamn. Under any other circumstance, I‚Äôd applaud you for the sick burn. You sure it wasn't intentional?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was an accident! And she seemed more pissed about that than actually being shot at!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I would be, too, but I‚Äôm not sane, so you can't really use me as an example there... Hmm,‚Äù Noah murmured, starting to pace for a moment. ‚ÄúI have a solution.‚Äù

Tobby skittered closer, taking Noah by the shirt again. ‚ÄúTell me!! I don‚Äôt wanna spend two months in a truck with someone that wants to skin me and wear me like a hat!‚Äù He pleaded.

‚ÄúJust get her something nice! It's the oldest solution in the book, just don't snot beg all over her or my shirt,‚Äù he answered, trying to pry Tobby off again.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ I uhh‚Ä¶what should I get her?‚Äù Tobby had to think about that one. The only person he ever got gifts for in the past was his mom, and a few poorly attempted goes at those ‚Äòeveryone gets candy‚Äô holidays at school.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I have to ask this violently stereotypical question, but what does she like?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't ‚Äòuhh‚Äô at me! You‚Äôre the one who wants to appease her, you gotta know something she likes if you care that much.‚Äù

Darn him for having perfectly valid points Tobby couldn't refute! ‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked down trying to think, playing back every moment he'd ever seen Soapy like like a squeaky tape, looking for anything beyond the briefest of conversations he could pull an idea from. Last night came to mind though‚Ä¶ she had that book, she always has a book. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs into cosmic horror. Does that help?‚Äù

Noah just looked down at him for a moment. ‚ÄúSeriously?... You know her choice of literature but not like her favorite color or if she likes chocolate or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe only other thing we've ever talked about was Wanderlust, but that's not exactly something I can give her now can I?‚Äù

‚ÄúFair point, fair point. I got something, but you owe me,‚Äù Noah said before turning and walking back up the ramp into his ship.

Tobby, by the powers of curiosity and‚Ä¶ even more curiosity hesitantly followed the human. Oddly this was the first time he‚Äôd ever touched the ship, much less went inside. Atop the ramp, he looked inside to see the open cargo bay had been converted into some kind of cargo/garage/workshop hybrid with various work areas, storage, and secured vehicles. Spacious yet chaotic.

He saw Noah digging through a crate near a door leading to the rest of the ship. Diving in there with his feet off the ground and everything before he came back up and blew the dust off three books. ‚ÄúLet's see‚Ä¶ I think she speaks enough English to understand these,‚Äù he said, showing the three books to Tobby. ‚ÄúYou know what she reads better than I do, so pick one. I got *The Neko-Nomicon, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and Shadow over Innsmouth.*‚Äù

‚ÄúDare I ask what each of those is about...?‚Äù

Noah looked down at the books for a moment. ‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ a cybernetic feline necromancy spellbook, demons, and uhh‚Ä¶ I think this one is about some elder god named Dagon.‚Äù

*‚ÄòNope, Nope, and‚Ä¶ that last one should be fine.‚Äô* Tobby thought, but he had a better question. ‚ÄúWhy do you even have those!?‚Äù 

‚ÄúReasons‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not an answer!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it is, now do you want them or not Mr. sassy?‚Äù Noah squinted.

Tobby slumped, sounding defeated. ‚ÄúThe third one please‚Ä¶‚Äù

Noah tossed the other two back in the crate before handing off the scuffed paperback book to Tobby. ‚ÄúGlad to be of service~‚Äù he said, putting on that salesman smile. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll tell you what every merchant tells guys buying gifts for their girlfriends. She‚Äôll love it~‚Äù

**That** struck a chord Tobby didn‚Äôt even realize was there. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not my-‚Äù

‚Äî

This was a terrible idea. Why in the name of patrons would they send Tobby and her out there *again?* In the same truck, at the same spot, to do the same delivery, again? No matter how Soapy looked at it, last night was a warning. The sha-kai who strafed the truck didn‚Äôt bother to stop and try to steal the delivery, they just sped off. *‚ÄòThey‚Äôre either stupid, well-informed vigilantes, or more likely they just wanted to take a stab at the Wiskitos to get out of the game.‚Äô* Soapy thought to herself struggling to keep any kind of focus on the pages.

She‚Äôd been on the same page for a good twenty minutes having to restart over and over as she kept recalling the night before. It wasn't the first time she‚Äôd been shot at, but it has been a while. Even then she usually had BB or Kaykay whisking her to safety whenever things went bad. This time she‚Äôd been alone‚Ä¶ well not alone, per se, there was Tobby‚Ä¶

Her gaze drifted over to the antsy sun-kin in the passenger seat checking every direction but her own. Every little sound made him flinch to look for the source. Her eyes trailed down to his anxiously bouncing paw and the gun between his legs. 

*‚ÄòPoor guy‚Äôs usually unarmed, last night must have really spooked him if he brought that much firepower. Did Noah give him that or is that what he blew all his money on?‚Äô* Soapy pondered but her eyes kept getting pulled up to that lone ear always pointed towards her. He looked like he was about to piss himself, practically jumping at his own shadow, yet he was still devoting half of his most powerful sense specifically to her‚Ä¶ maybe Tobby wasn‚Äôt even aware he was doing it. Or he just really didn't like her‚Ä¶ Seriously, what did she do?

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the hardware?‚Äù She asked, not looking up from the book she was failing to read. If the ‚Äòactively reading‚Äô look worked last time, it would work again.

Tobby, as expected, jumped at the noise, though just a little harder than usual. ‚ÄúWha-who- O-oh this?‚Äù He stammered, acting just a little too jittery to be the kind of sha she‚Äôd trust with a submachine gun. ‚ÄúI-It‚Äôs for If we get attacked‚Ä¶ again.‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt maintain eye contact with her and he kept glancing down at the gun‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ the bag next to the gun.

‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù She said with all the confidence his answer inspired. ‚ÄúMaaaaybe you should‚Ä¶I dunno‚Ä¶ Give that to me before a moth flutters too close to your ear and you spray the interior of the truck?‚Äù She suggested. Nobody wanted to be reduced to ricochet salsa by the resident nervous guy. She‚Äôd seen bad trigger discipline, and she would forever hold that over Kaykay for shooting himself in the foot.

‚ÄúWhat?! No! I-Im fine, really. Noah made this just for me and I intend to use it‚Ä¶ if necessary.‚Äù

Okay, she had to ask. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take this the wrong way but‚Ä¶ have you ever killed anyone? Or shot at anyone‚Ä¶? Or hit anyone‚Ä¶? Or defended yourself? Like‚Ä¶ Ever?‚Äù She asked tilting her head a bit and looking up from the book now that the ice was broken.

He didn‚Äôt answer for a good long while, biting his lip while his eyes darted around like he was searching for a way out, ANY way out, like a bunny in an iron trap. Finally, he mumbled something‚Ä¶ too quiet to understand but enough to make one of her own ears twitch.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù she pushed.

Another little glance towards her before cringing again. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù He admitted just loud enough for her to hear.

Aaaaand now Soapy knew what she was dealing with, exactly what she expected. A complete and utter needler with no blood on his claws, no training, no discipline, and armed by the mad monkey himself like a Sha-Kai operative. Probably for the shits and giggles of it, too! He was as rattled as any normal civvy would be after getting sprayed like that and surviving.

She must have been wearing her thoughts on her face because, after one glance, he shrank inwards. ‚ÄúSorry‚Ä¶‚Äù

Soapy rolled her eyes ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt apologize, you can apologize after someone gets hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù At least she thought that was something Whiskers would say in a situation like this. ‚ÄúDo you even know how to use that thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ Noah showed me.‚Äù Tobby said, with a voice less confident than the hands that picked the gun up and leveled it with some practiced ease. Took the magazine out, racked it, put the round back in the mag, and slotted it back in. He even knew where the safety was. One wouldn't believe the number of Shasians who don‚Äôt know human guns had them until it‚Äôs too late. Wannabe Sha-kai trying to quickdraw the pistol he just bought only for the safety to still be on‚Ä¶ Natural selection at its finest.

Still that only made Soapy feel a little better, and he kept looking down at the bag. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ did he give you grenades too?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrenades?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, grenades. I assume that's what's in the bag given you keep looking down at it like it's about to blow your dick off.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶‚Äù He shivered. ‚ÄúWas a mental image I really didn't need to see, nor imagine ever again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Jokes about spontaneous explosive castration make you queasy?‚Äù She teased, smirking a bit. 

‚ÄúN-No‚Ä¶ it's just... Graphic.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSays the bookish guy with the gun made to give his fellow sha more gaping holes than a Xosian cathouse?‚Äù

‚Äú... That's another mental image I didn't need living in my head,‚Äù he said, ears going flat atop his head.

‚ÄúTobby?‚Äù She deadpanned.

‚ÄúY-Yeah‚Ä¶?‚Äù He stammered.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the fucking bag?‚Äù She asks so calmly, looking at him with eyes half-lidded in that nonplussed expression.

He got nervous again. ‚ÄúCan uhh‚Ä¶ can we not talk about it? I just‚Ä¶‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt look at her anymore, scratching at his neck and tripping over his words.

Could he have said anything more suspicious? One might start getting wild ideas about why he‚Äôs so nervous all the time and acting like he has such a guilty conscience. One might even start making even wilder assumptions about his loyalties, but he seemed too timid for just plain betrayal. ‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶ No. Just tell me what it is, 'cause the more you try to hide it, the worse the things I'm going to assume are in there.‚Äù

He tensed and she saw his fur stand up in places as he went stuff. *‚ÄòHe‚Äôs afraid, he‚Äôs not just nervous about a repeat of last night, he was legitimately afraid. Why? What‚Äôs he hiding?‚Äô* she thought, looking between him and said bag.

She opened her mouth to threaten him into telling her what he was hiding, but near biological FTL struck again as he just handed it to her and gulped. ‚ÄúHere! I'm not hiding anything, I just‚Ä¶ I don't‚Ä¶‚Äù

She took the bag before he could implode any further. She doubted it was a bomb given how light it was and oddly flexible. Sudden curiosity won out over caution as she opened it and- ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù she blinked looking down at the book in hand. ‚ÄúIt's‚Ä¶ a book? Why do you have one of the books? I‚Äôve never seen you read on one of these deliveries.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt from the back, it's‚Ä¶ for you.‚Äù He tried to explain like he was fighting every instinct not to do so.

‚ÄúFor me?‚Äù She repeated aloud, as it was now her turn to be the confused one looking between him and said book. It took her a second to decipher the cover seeing it was in the human lingua franka‚Ä¶ aka English. ‚ÄúSha‚Ä¶dow oveer- over Inz.. Innsmoth?‚Äù She tried to sound it out as her brain needed a moment to make the jarring swap to English. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you get me a book? There‚Äôs tons of 'em in the back, and I just nab a new one every time I finish one,‚Äù she questioned, looking back to Tobby.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ thought you were mad at me?‚Äù He framed it almost like a question as if even he wasn't sure that was the reason.

‚ÄúWhy would I be mad at you? The only thing I have to be pissed about is you acting like the guiltiest-looking traitor this side of Nykata.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause uhh.. What I said last night.‚Äù he smiled sheepishly, managing to look at her again. ‚ÄúFor which I am sorry.‚Äù he shrank.

‚ÄúWhat you said last night?‚Äù She muttered to herself trying to think of anything he‚Äôd said to warrant this kind of response.

‚ÄúThe whole ‚ÄòI‚Äôd rather not‚Äô bit?‚Äù He tried to point out, forcing that scared smile all the harder as he shrank further. ‚ÄúPlease don't hurt me‚Ä¶‚Äù he squeaked.

Aaaaand it finally clicked. ‚ÄúYou were afraid I was going to hurt you because I yelled at you for all of 0.5 seconds in a knee-jerk reaction to you turning down an offer I didn't actually make? An offer I seldom extend to anyone, by the way. I just thought you were saying I was unfuckable for a moment.‚Äù

He was going to disappear into the seat at this rate, the smile was good though. ‚ÄúOkay, it sounds a little silly when you put it like that.‚Äù *‚ÄòD‚Äôaww now he looked ashamed.‚Äô* ‚ÄúI mean you are, but it might have been a bit rude of me to assume you'd be super mad about me implying to the contrary,‚Äù he said awkwardly scratching at his jawline.

‚ÄúYeah, after I went off I immediately remembered just who I was dealing with. My ego isn't that fragile, I-‚Äù she paused for a moment *‚ÄòHooold up‚Ä¶ what did he just say? Does his piss poor choice of words deceive me or did he just say what I think he said?‚Äô* she thought before squinting at him. ‚ÄúWhat was that last bit?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat it was rude to assume you'd be mad about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, the other thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat the whole situation sounds a little silly?..‚Äù 

Soapy facepalmed. ‚ÄúNo, the middle bit!‚Äù

‚ÄúMiddle bit‚Ä¶?‚Äù He questioned, head tilting a bit in his confusion. 

‚Äú*I mean you are,*‚Äù she repeated for him, trying, poorly, to copy his voice.

He froze but she got her answer anyway, as those tall ears of his flushed red and immediately went flat atop his head. ‚ÄúCute~‚Äù she smirked at the speechless sunspot trying to hide his face. ‚ÄúPretty sure I beat the shit out the last guy who said something that forward, or BB killed him‚Ä¶ one or the other. Probably both‚Äù she suggested tapping a claw on her chin and looking up in mock pensiveness.

Aaand that was the fastest she‚Äôd ever seen Tobby go pale, she better save him before he freaks out too hard. ‚ÄúBuuut, I did just get a new book so I think I‚Äôll let it slide~‚Äù she smugly purred.

Tobby sighed and she could almost see the worry melting off his shoulders. ‚ÄúOh good, I was worried for a second there.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf!‚Äù she continued making him tense again, she clearly wasn‚Äôt good for his heart. ‚ÄúIf you drop by Whisker‚Äôs later sometime before we open. I think I can forgive this egregious and highly unforgivable slight. If I get to beat your ass a little.‚Äù Her evil smirk grew as he started panicking again. ‚ÄúWe sometimes set up a Bap-tal ring in the clubhouse to let patrons and amateurs duke it out for fun. I think we have a set of gloves small enough to fit you.‚Äù She blepped her tongue a little just to taunt him for freaking out.

He had to process for a moment before he finally relaxed again. ‚ÄúS-sure‚Ä¶‚Äù Before glancing down at his hands and then at hers. ‚ÄúMy hands are bigger though‚Ä¶‚Äù He mumbled.

Oh yeah, it wouldn‚Äôt even be a fight. Her ego might not be delicate, but it was certainly getting stroked harder than Xoso‚Äôs finest after that reluctant little compliment. The fact she nearly had to pull teeth to get him to let something like that slip just made it all the more fun. And if she got him in the ring tomorrow, she‚Äôd mark him up good. Nothing says *‚ÄòHe's MY toy‚Äô* like challenging a complete and utter needler to fight just so you can style on them. Oh, she was so looking forward to it!

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here.‚Äù He said, pulling Soapy out of the daydream of kicking his slinky orange ass in the ring to see his ears flick backward. Her ears flicked back too, picking up the heavy engine seconds later. ‚ÄúDid they say anything about bringing an escort this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ why?‚Äù Soapy replied, growing concerned.

Tobby expression fell. ‚ÄúCause I hear a truck and three lighter cars.‚Äù he turned, ears flicking a few more times. ‚ÄúAre they using the green signal light?‚Äù

Soapy looked to the driver's side mirror where between the curves in the remote road and tree stands she caught a growing number of headlights. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFloor it‚Ä¶ floor it now,‚Äù he demanded, getting that stare like he had last night after getting shot at.

‚ÄúWhat? It's a bit far out for them to be flashing that little pen light-‚Äù

Dallas's office Auto Chef is always stocked but we know she's not the one doing it because she never knows what's in it. Same for Peabody. Though I do think she knows what staples will always be in it; coffee, Miras tea, Pepsi, and pepperoni pizza. 

Roarke has made statements in the past eluding to having a certain item stocked for her, but never that he himself stocks it. 

So if Roarke is having her AC stocked, it's likely he'd hand that off to Summerset. 

Summerset is skilled as a thief and I genuinely think he'd do this because it's a funny way to get back at her for all of her hilarious one line zingers she'll throw at him when she gets home.

Does anyone agree? Disagree? 

ETA: As I'm sitting here thinking about this I just had another thought.
