1ghzue1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1ghzue1/random_alaska_observations_from_someone_who/,"Random Alaska observations from someone who usually flies Delta (First Class, vegan, non-alcoholic, and lounge musings)  LONG POST","  
TL;DR: I still prefer Delta (for reasons that are primarily personal preference and circumstance in nature), but Alaska is quite solid, and if Delta pulled out of our home base — SEA — I would have no issues flying Alaska full time.

Flying back from JFK to SEA today, after having flown from SEA to JFk last weekend.  We usually fly Delta, but I decided to status match to Alaska to try them out for the first time since the pandemic.  Flight was cheaper on AS too.

We only fly first class, and as a general rule always check bags.  We are both vegan.  My wife was never a drinker, whereas my drinking days are now over and I don‘t drink.

1.  In-cabin service: about equal to me.  The first class cabin attendant on this flight is superb; the attendant on the flight to NYC was above-average.  I can’t say it’s any better or worse than Delta.

2.  Baggage check-in, SEA: Delta wins, but small AS sample size.  At SEA, I love Delta; first class check-in is as a general rule quite friendly, and the wait is usually quite short.  You’re also closer to the pre-check CLEAR security lane at the far south of the airport, which is generally not busy.

AS had a long line at first class check-in, and only a couple of agents working the first class area; our agent was not particularly friendly.  I realize this is a sample size of one.  I do not like the pre-check security area that AS is closest to, which is hectic.

3.  Baggage check-in, JFK.  This is our first time visiting NYC in a long time, so I don’t have any experience with DL.  The AS first class baggage check-in was amazing, though.  

There was a large group from New Jersey checking in their rifles for a hunting trip to Alaska, with the requisite TSA and police people having to take the gun bags (cases?).  An AS agent noticed the line was backing up as a result, and quickly opened a couple of more desks.

4.  Lounge, SEA: Delta wins (again, small AS sample size).  For AS we visited the D gates lounge.  It was acceptable.  Not bad; not memorable.  Since our flight was over 2,000 miles (2,100 miles?), we got free access although were prepared to pay for a day pass.

Delta at SEA, by comparison, I love.  While it’s always busy, I never find it super crowded.  A larger space than AS D gates, which reminds me of an Escape lounge.  Also, I have both the Amex Platinum card and the Amex Delta Reserve card, so between the two of them I’m covered to get into the lounge free (even with the limits starting in 2025).

I found the AS lounge agents to be friendlier than the DL agents, although that says more about AS than DL — the AS people were unusually nice.

As an FYI, the primary reason I like going to the lounge if only because you are not worn down by the incessant auditory barrage that plagues US airports.  Why can’t we learn from the Europeans and the Asians, who have figured out how to make gate-specific announcements without subjecting the entire terminal to them, and understand that the constant “if you see something, say something” messages don’t improve security.  

And don’t get me started on the airports where the mayors insist on recording a “Welcome to \[city\]” messages that are played back every 5 minutes in baggage claim.  Particularly DFW, where you get both the Dallas AND the Fort Worth mayors.

5. Lounge, JFK.  I can only speak to AS for first class, which was adequate.  Smaller than SEA D gates lounge.  Agent at lounge check-in was super friendly.  Our flight was super early, so lounge was not crowded.

Aforementioned Jersey hunting group was also in the lounge.  They were loud, but the lounge interestingly enough swallowed up most of their volume.  My wife was still annoyed (not a morning person), but I love Jersey folk, and eavesdropped the entire time.  

As for Delta, we connected through JFK on the way back to SEA from Europe a couple of months ago, and got to try out the new Delta One lounge.  I’ll give an unpopular opinion.  It’s over the top in an unnecessary way.  I don’t need a day spa or a sit-down restaurant in a lounge.  I want a clean, large space with ample seating, and friendly staff.

The D1 lounge I feel is just trying too hard.  And much more crowded than I was expecting.  But to each their own.

6.  Vegan food, lounge: Delta wins by a mile.  First, Delta marks all their lounge food as to whether it’s vegan, vegetarian, etc.  Very, very easy for a vegan to nosh at the Sky Club.  Breakfast options can sometimes be slim (but there’s always something), but lunch and dinner are always plentiful.

Alaska, by comparison, was borderline vegan-hostile in its lounge offerings (our phrase for a place that seems to go out of its way to alienate vegans).  Nothing is marked.  I had to flag down an employee and ask.

AS SEA did have a good cowboy caviar on our visit in the afternoon.  AS JFK for breakfast, though … jeesh.  There was fruit.  No cereal (usually the standby in these situations).  I did verify that the granola was vegan, and used the non-dairy milk by the coffee to pour over the granola.  

7.  Vegan food, first class cabin: Alaska, with a caveat.  Delta lets you select ahead of time any type of “special dietary meal” (the options are really quite something — Hindi, various Asian options, etc., in addition to gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, yada yada).  So we always can get a vegan meal (“VGML” in the vernacular).  I usually like it, but it can be plain, and I’ve had the same meal multiple times as well.

For the pre-order meals, my understanding is that Alaska now always has a vegan option, which is on par with the other two “regular” options — i.e., it’s not a special dietary meal.  The meals were more tasty than what we usually get on Delta.  For example, on this flight, we got a turmeric tofu scramble with plant-based chorizo crumbles.

The AS caveat is that everything other than the entree is not necessarily vegan: you get the same thing everyone else gets, whereas with DL, everything on the plate as a general rule will be vegan.  So we got bread which may or may not be vegan, along with butter, and Greek yogurt.  

8.  Non-alcoholic beer, lounge: Alaska wins.  Delta serves Bud Zero, which is meh.  Alaska was serving Athletic in SEA (the bar wasn’t yet open in JFK).  

9.  NA beer in the air: Alaska also wins.  Delta doesn’t offer NA beer on the plane.  Alaska served Best Day (Good Day?  Can’t remember) Brewing beer.  While the style wasn’t my favorite — an “electro lime” Mexican lager — I respect the effort.

So there you have it.  One flyer’s observations.  I’ll close with one comment — on a 5 1/2+ hour flight from NYC to SEA, I cannot believe that there isn’t an airline that doesn’t offer a business class cabin (AS of course doesn’t have one, but DL should offer D1), like you can do from NYC to LAX (and maybe Boston too)?  I think the flight from JFK to SEA is shorter than from JFK to London…",1,1730563684.0,AlaskaAirlines,0,1.0,False

**Diary of Saint Faustina - paragraph 274 - The Weight of the Words**

**274 I sometimes talk too much. A thing could be settled in one or two words, and as for me, I take too much time about it. But Jesus wants me to use that time to say some short indulgenced prayers for the souls in purgatory. And the Lord says that every word will be weighed on the day of judgment.**

This is another good entry from Saint Faustina's Diary for All Souls Day. It's also a bit curious because It begins with Saint Faustina's notion that she's too wordy, implying less words are better. Christ seems to confirm this by telling her to say short prayers for souls in purgatory and the entry ends with Christ telling her, “every word will be weighed on the day of judgment,” which could be understood as more wordy prayer carrying more weight with God. The question becomes, when God weighs each word of our prayer, is He measuring the quantity or the quality of our words?

I tend to be too wordy when praying in my own words, going on unnecessarily with details that God certainly knows better than I do anyway. Ironically though, if I make shorter a prayer for whatever the intentions may be, and then follow up with the longer, repetitive Rosary or Chaplet of Divine Mercy, there is a greater sense of connection to God. Meditating on the intentions of the Chaplet or the mysteries of the Rosary while reciting the prayers creates a greater oneness between intentions and prayer as both seem to become commingled into something greater. The weight of the words become greater and the intentions seem interioraly magnified when not distracted by trying to find one's own best words.

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible**

**Matthew 6:7 And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens. For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard.**

The above verse is often used in an attempt to discredit prayers like the Rosary or Chaplet. It needs to be remembered though that Christ was not speaking of Christian or Jewish prayers in that verse anyway. He was talking about heathen prayers in an age when they would recite numerous names of false deities, hoping that at least one would answer their prayer. The Rosary or Chaplet are obviously different, being repetitive prayers to the One True God, combined with meditations on the intentions of the prayer and on various events in the life of Christ and His Blessed Mother.

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible**

**Romans 8:26 Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For, we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groaning.**

Prayer may always be a clumsy thing for us, trying to interact with a God of Spirit while our own spirit remains distracted by our troublesome flesh. An achy knee, extra cup of coffee or not enough sleep can all mess up our ability to connect with God so anything that stimulates the spirit will exalt our prayer, especially since our spirit is a measure of God Himself in us. I think this is what Paul was getting at in the verse from Romans. Being creatures of both flesh and spirit, I think our words represent the fleshy side of our prayer and our yearning interior self represents the unspeakable groanings of our spirit.

The weight of our words in prayer is intimately linked to their ethereal connection with our God given spirit. And that's not the “human spirit” we hear about so often because humans had no Spirit until God breathed it into us as the last act of our creation. What we sometimes call the human spirit is really a portion of the eternal Godhead, our Father the Creator, with Christ, His Word and the Holy Ghost, our teacher. And when we pray, whether Rosary, Chaplet, or in our own words, those prayers need not be outwardly directed up into heaven but inwardly aimed where human flesh touches the Indwelling Godhead, to be weighed, judged and discerned before God's righteousness and in our own humility.

1ghzrv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_biskwy/comments/1ghzrv1/butter_sugar_bread/,Butter Sugar Bread ,"In what seem to possibly be many months or even years, I had my first butter sugar bread. 

These cheap dollar breads had significant meaning behind it. 

I used to work at a hospital and at the height of my eating disorder, I will hoard these bread. The hospital had plenty of soon-to-expire bread that they give for free in the pantry. I would take anywhere between 6 to 10 of these bread every shift so I could snack on them or use them as binge/purge food. They made calorie counting extremely simple and easy. 200 calories per bread, four a day, plus two cups of coffee. 

But my favourite, one which I loved so much and happen to be the rarest, butter sugar bread. I was the happiest I ever been whenever I see butter sugar bread stocked in the pantry. I loved it so much I would take my time, enjoy every bite and start dancing. I couldn't physically contain this happiness. 

Everybody knows it. In fact, everybody loved me so much that they would look out for any butter sugar bread in the pantry. If there were any, they would instantly run up to the resting area and tell me. Oftentimes, they will even snatch a couple for me. My last day, a dear colleague of mine bought a huge bag of butter sugar bread for me. 

It hurts because I look back at such a dark time of my life and see so much love. I spent what happened to be 8 months of my life, in a place where I needed it most. Surrounded by people who knew I'm deeply mentally ill, who constantly checked up on me, but also deeply loved me enough to show it. 

Bread never tasted the same afterwards. And I can't remember the last time I had a butter sugar bread. 

It was truly the worse of times, and the best of times. I had so much freedom and love, and was shrouded in so much darkness and anger. 

I can't help but feel a gut-wrenching nostalgia. Did I mention there was shift work? Half the time, it was night shifts. I will spend my nights playing game, listening to true crime podcast and talking to others. I felt free in a way that I don't think many get to experience. I worked hard because I wanted to earn enough for my funeral. When I reached that goal, I was lost. I didn't really know what was keeping me going, perhaps my friends.

Even before my now ex boyfriend ended things, I always had a weird connection with this friend. We play dnd in a group every 2 weeks. Our characters often flirt a bit in our sessions. When we talk it feels effortless, incredibly fun, and engaging. Our senses of humor match so well, we reference the same shows and movies and we have the exact same taste in music.

Two weeks after my break up, I met up with him for coffee. He found out it was the day before my birthday so he quickly bought me some random gifts and paid for our lunch. We were originally only supposed to meet for an hour/hour and a half, but we lost track of time and talked for almost 4 hours.

Some notable things that have happened:

\-In a long car ride with friends, he kept complimenting my music. In the end he said something along the lines of me being a ""cool girl.""

\-I ran into him at a concert and he was incredibly stoked and introducing me to all his friends

\-He remembers things I told him months ago and things I posted on instagram from months before. I'll post a song and next time I see him he references the band or the song. He views every story I post regardless of how busy he is. When he was on vacation, he still looked at all of my stories. He actually watches and reads the whole thing. Never experienced a guy doing that this consistently. He'll even bring up reels that I liked when he sees me and say things like, ""I saw you liked this one reel. I didn't know you liked this too.""

\-He compliments my clothes a lot. Tells me I look cool. He smiles at things I have around my house whenever our group comes over, he just compliments things I like very often.

\-One time when we were playing dnd, chips fell down my shirt and I instinctively was cleaning the chips off my chest. I may or may not have pulled my tank top down a tiny bit when I was absentmindedly doing this. When I looked up, he was watching me, checking me out, and laughing at me that I was saving snacks for later.

\-I went to a concert with some of our mutual friends and he brought a lot of friends too. He was so stoked to see me again. When the concert was over, he came up to me and was hardcore pushing me to go to the after party, even holding up the open train schedule to show me how much longer I could stay. When I was first uncertain because I needed to not wait too long to walk my dog, he said, ""your dog doesn't like walks anyway."" He did not push any of the guys to stay. Just asked them if they wanted to join. So I stayed a little bit longer where the party blasted a lot of pop punk. He laughed and smiled at me every time I knew all the words. When I did eventually have to leave, he kissed my cheek. He never did that before.

\-When I brought up that I went on a date last week, he looked a bit annoyed and brushed over it. He

Now he's been seeing someone for a little over a  month. I'm a little bummed and I keep trying to move on from my feelings for him as I do not want to flirt with someone in a relationship, but then I keep I see him again and he does or says something that makes me feel like he likes me too. I have never flirted with someone I know is in a relationship before and it may be weird but the light flirting just kind of alleviates some of my anxiety and gives me a bit of confidence, which I have really needed.

I work full time. I care for my grandmother. I also care for my parents. I don’t have kids or a spouse. When would I have the time?

We have made incredible advances in medical care allowing people live longer, but I often think, to what end? We help people live longer, but do not not have resources in place to make those extra years worth living- in many (maybe most) cases. 

My grandmother is blessed. My grandfather was of the generation that had pensions and good insurance. She is still covered by his fantastic insurance from the company that he worked at for his entire life. He died 15 years ago. That doesn’t happen anymore. I bet she is the last remaining person on that policy for the whole international company. She has people who care and has a nice home. Despite what she says, she has been able to age with comfort and dignity. 

My generation (currently 30-40yo) are not having kids at the same rate previous generations did, a lot of us are single. I don’t have kids. I’m also not married. What’s the plan for us when we get old, sick and infirm? We won’t have kids or spouses to shoulder the burden of caregiving. Our insurance situation sucks. 

Even if we do have kids, we can’t expect them to shoulder the financial burden of this. The economy isn’t what it was when even my parents were working. Everyone is struggling to save. I’m not even going to tell you how much I spent at the grocery store this week for me, my parents and my grandmother- and I cook every meal- make them stretch- no organic- beans, pasta, and I grow as much food as I can afford to grow myself. 

My “retirement plan” includes enough money to do some traveling while I’m still young enough and healthy enough to do it. Then I’ll end my travel tour in Amsterdam, stay a while and sample all the coffee shops, look at art, and when I’m ready. That will be it. 

No state run nursing home for me to be uncared for and bored. Being bored is the worst fate of them all- for me anyway.

1ghzia3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ghzia3/daily_drinker_finally_quit/,Daily drinker finally quit,"TL;DR Mid 50’s, daily drinker for 20+ years, hundreds of failed attempts to quit but I was finally successful (481 days!). If I can do it, anyone can do it.

When I was trying to quit drinking in January of 2023 I stumbled across this sub and it helped me a lot. With that in mind I am adding my story in hopes that someone finds it helpful. If nothing else maybe it takes your mind off drinking for a little bit. Sorry for the length but that’s why the TL;DR is at the top.

I‘m in my mid 50’s and I have been a daily drinker for more than 20 years. I was what some people refer to as a” controlled drinker”. I used to joke that I knew where I wanted to be and I knew what it took to get there. The problem was, that over time, the amount of alcohol it took to get me where I wanted to be kept increasing.

I tried to quit hundreds of times. Sometimes I’d last a few weeks, sometimes a few days, but mostly it would be a few hours. I’d “quit” drinking when I woke up in the morning but then I’d have a beer in my hand by 4pm that afternoon.  That’s where I was in October of 2022, attempting a sober October that would ultimately end at 10 days.

There was something different about that failed sober October for me. For years I had told  myself that I could quit whenever I wanted. But here I was confronted with the recurring truth of my lies. 

The years of abuse were finally catching up to me. I was drinking more and feeling terrible. Physically and mentally I was a mess. I felt that I had lost control and was incapable of making a change. I was stressed out and scared of the situation I had gotten myself into. I was also afraid of telling anyone or talking to anyone about it. I kept it bottled up inside where it ate at me every day. I was in a dark place. That of course led to a lot more drinking through November and into December.

In December of 2022 I started thinking about a Dry January but I was discouraged and depressed. I had no reason to think I would be successful. I also didn’t want to ask anyone to join me because it would only highlight my inevitable failure. So I did nothing.

That’s when I got lucky.

Early on New Years Day 2023 I was included in a group text from some friends. It turns out that they were concerned about their own drinking, they were planning a Dry January, and they wanted to know if anyone wanted to join them. I was thrilled and joined them immediately.

There were 7-8 of us in that group. I don’t know why the idea of me doing a dry January alone, or even organizing a group myself was so terrifying. Nor do I understand why joining others in this effort to quit made it seem so much more achievable. But having a group to talk with, people who were going through the experience together was insanely helpful. I was so thankful for being included and felt their incredible support throughout the month.

That doesn’t mean it was easy. Dry January was hard. It was really hard. It was near daily conversations, and text chats, with people. We talked a lot about why we were drinking, we were rethinking habits, and trying to make a change. It sounds cliche but during January we were all just taking it one day at a time. I had to stop worrying about whether I would make it a month and just focused on getting through the day. It was during this time that I found r/stopdrinking. Reading the stories posted here was helpful and I shared the link to my group.

I had a strong sense of relief as we neared the end of January. Like I had reasserted some control over something I hadn’t had a lot of control of. I felt good and started talking to others about extending the “dry” beyond just January. I also had an ulterior motive. My annual physical was coming up in early February and I like having labs done after a dry month. This was actually my usual MO (method of operation). I cut back on the drinking in January, among some other healthy changes, in hopes my labs are better. So I extended dry January, had my labs done and waited for the results.

Those results came quicker than I had anticipated and they were terrifying. The lab results were bad generally but specifically showed really elevated liver enzymes. They were high, very high. Then I started to wonder, if my liver enzymes were this high after a dry month, how high had they been at the end of December? Getting these results was like a smack in the face. A smack I should’ve expected after 20+ years of this.

You might think that these results would finally push me to be honest with my Dr. about my drinking. You would be wrong. I’ve always been vague about my drinking with my Dr. I would say I had a couple beers, but wouldn’t say the beers were 16oz Imperial IPA’s. I would say I had a couple bourbons, but wouldn’t say the bourbons were triples. Neither one of us is dumb enough to think we’re fooling the other but that doesn’t mean I was honest.

Anyway I got ahead of the conversation by telling him what I had done (quit drinking) and then we chatted about moving forward. He said no drinking and then we’d retest in 6 months and see where we were. 

I should probably mention at this point that I had a 10 day vacation with my family planned for June of that year. This is an interesting point because I was terrified of my elevated liver enzymes, feeling good about a successful dry January, but didn’t want to take drinking off the table for vacation in June? Sadly I still wanted the option. So I planned to get tested in late May and go from there.

With a plan in place, dry January became dry February, March, and April. You might be wondering how I got my mind off the alcohol during this time. Especially because my routine was to get home from work and start cracking beers, then cook dinner, then start in with the after dinner drinks. My daily drinking was evenings doing food prep and eating. Every day.

I’ve always been an active person. I have trouble sitting still so I refocused myself. When I got home from work I would exercise instead of grabbing a beer. When I started cooking I would open a fizzy (flavored/seltzer) water. After dinner instead of bourbon I would have desert, a small bowl of chocolate chips, or ice cream. I started breaking the connections I had between doing things and drinking. I also discovered NA beers during this time. I know NA beers can be controversial but they were very helpful for me when I was quitting. I still enjoy them occasionally at home, with friends or at dinner.

And that’s how the time passed. Quietly with me making positive changes every day. It was never easy but it did feel great. Between January and May I lost about 15 pounds, I was in better shape, I felt better, looked better, was sleeping better, and having regular, solid bowel movements for the first time in a long time. 

I know people will ask so I’ll take a moment to talk more about the positive changes I went through in those months I was cutting out the alcohol. First, the weight started dropping off. Not surprising when you cut out a couple thousand calories of alcohol a day and the associated late night snacks I was eating. Coupled with the exercise I started to feel better, I had more energy, and was less lethargic. My body stopped hurting as much and I lost that puffy look I had cultivated. The bloodshot eyes went away too.

My sleep improved. Throughout this experience I had been afraid of sleep. I had long ago stopped falling asleep naturally. I was really worried that when I stopped drinking I wouldn’t be able to sleep. At the beginning I used melatonin to help me get to sleep but quickly found I didn’t need it. I found out that if I just layed down on the bed and closed my eyes I would fall asleep within a few minutes. I would try to read but never made it more than a few pages before I was out.

And the quality of my sleep improved. When I was drinking I’d toss and turn all night, I’d get up to go to the bathroom several times and this would inevitably wake up my wife. Then she’d have to go to the bathroom and she’d be tossing and turning all night too. Together we’d sleep terribly, waking the other up and making it harder to fall asleep. I’m in my 50’s so I still cannot get through the night without a bathroom break but I’m not tossing and turning like I was. I sleep more soundly, my heart isn’t racing, and as a result my wife sleeps better and since she sleeps better I sleep better. It’s a weird cycle.

So I wake up refreshed instead of hung over. I enjoy getting out of bed and making coffee. I enjoy not being in pain every morning, with my head splitting and my mouth dry. I also enjoy natural bowel movements. Gone are the unpredictable, barely controlled, violent explosive poops I thought were “normal”. I’m no longer listening to my stomach churn and rumble, wondering when I’ll need to run to the bathroom. I’m nice and regular and solid too.  

At the end of May I had the lab tests done again. This time everything was fine. I was happy and the Dr. was happy. But I was left with a choice. Do I start drinking again? Do I stay alcohol free? I struggled with this decision but ultimately decided to try to moderate my drinking while on vacation. I would have a beer with lunch or dinner, after dinner drinks a few times. After 5 months alcohol free it felt a little weird but also good. I was largely successful at moderating and that may have given me a false hope.

When we got back from vacation I kept trying to moderate my alcohol and for a week or so it worked. But slowly that moderation slipped. And every day it slipped a little more. It slipped until about 3 weeks after the trip I was right back to my old drinking routines. 

That’s when I had, what I am calling a moment of clarity. I realized that all those failed attempts to quit through the years were failed attempts to moderate. I finally came to accept that moderation was never going to work for me. I finally came to accept that I was making a decision to continue to drink and that decision was, with certainty, going to kill me unless I stopped. 

And for the first time ever the idea of being completely sober didn’t scare me. My recent success in going alcohol free from January through May gave me a new, positive perspective. I knew what drinking would bring me, I knew where it would lead. I also knew what being sober would bring me, I knew where that would lead. At that point there wasn’t much to decide. I had 20+ years of bad experiences with alcohol, did I really want to go back? Or did I want the freedom and health that being sober brought?

I decided I was done trying to moderate and that I was done drinking for good. I think it’s important to mention that I never felt like I was choosing to give something up. I still don’t feel that way. I don’t feel like I lost something important or good. I didn’t lose anything. I can think back on any one of those 20+ years and think about how bad it was if I want to remind myself why I made the choice I did.

Instead I feel like I chose something better. I chose my life, my family, my friends and my health. And I am happy every day that I continue to make that choice.",2,1730562773.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I schedule as many colonoscopies as possible.  I would do two at a time if it was allowed.  I have two hands, why not use two scopes simultaneously?

All colonoscopy patients end up in one of two categories.  

1. If the colonoscopy was unremarkable: schedule for a follow-up colonoscopy in 6 months.
2. If the colonoscopy was abnormal: refer the patient to oncology or colorectal surgery.  Not my problem anymore!

For esophageal/stomach problems, we have to fully sedate the patient and shove a camera down their throat.  This technique was invented in 1868 and we have made minimal improvements since.

For small-intestinal problems, good luck lol.  We might as well be treating an illness on Mars.  I could order a capsule endoscopy, but insurance probably won’t cover it, and even if they do, it won’t give us much information anyway.

I start my day by ordering dozens of abdominal CT scans over a cup of coffee.  Most aren’t necessary, but I like to make sure that radiology is booked for weeks in advance.  That way, the gastroenterology wait times don’t seem so bad by comparison.

IBD patients: it is so much work having to actually provide ongoing care for these patients.  IBD is inflammatory so why can’t we just refer these patients to rheumatology?  Ugh.

Gastroparesis/dysmotility/Sibo/IBS patients: I don’t know how to help these patients.  This makes me uncomfortable.  Rather than admit that I don’t have answers, I typically prefer to get defensive and/or gaslight.  If I am lucky they will find a different provider.

I sleep well at night knowing that I am able to help my patients manage their symptoms.  Doctors aren’t actually expected to come up with long-term solutions.. right?

 I (24M) recently made friends in two different sports, and things are going great! But so far, we only really connect when we’re training. I’d like to take it further and create a tighter friend group with them outside of practice. I imagine us training together casually, maybe doing something else fun as well. Rather than waiting for someone to step up, I’ve decided to be the friend who plans and initiates.

But now I’m stuck on how to go about it. Should I start by asking for their contact info and see if they’re up for a game in the park? Or would a casual coffee hangout be a better first step?

I’d love to hear your suggestions on how to take these friendships outside of the sports setting!",4,1730562602.0,germany,2,1.0,False

Hey, just coming here for some support or advice. Triggered myself into a DPDR episode and have been having a hard time overcoming it. I’m 26 now &  had a pretty bad episode like 2 & a half years ago where I eventually did overcome it but now it feels like I’m back to square one & that it’s actually worse. Everyday I feel detached or unfamiliar with my surroundings and just in a dream. I feel as if I’m losing so much sense of time and reality like I’m even getting confused on what days of the week it is. Everyday I’m anxious and nervous and scared right now. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this or just some kind words. Feeling really defeated and lost & scared at the moment. Just want this to go away. I miss me, I miss my everyday things and going out w my friends or getting up & having my morning coffee (which I can’t do anymore bc online says cut out caffeine or alcohol and when I do I feel I have another episode bc I already read online it’s not good). I just wanna feel like I’m present again, I wanna look at my friends and my boyfriend and they look familiar or comforting to me. Ugh, like I’m not crazy right lol .. I’m scared I’m gonna lose sense of myself or end up on a psych ward. To give some context I am under a lot of stress prior to this happening, like I’ve been unemployed a few months & money is really tight and I’ve been making a lot of poor decisions lately. I’ve only ever had this like from THC but I triggered myself doing some c*ke at a party & now I’m all messed up again.  I also think I maybe have (self diagnosed) ocd & that’s why these loops happen that I get stuck with idk. I keep reading doomed things are people saying they’re halluncinating or getting psychosis from this and it’s freaking me the hell out and making it so much worse. My biggest fear is that like this reality is not real and I can’t shake the feeling as is. I would say I am getting good sleep but it sucks waking up and feeling like it immediately (this morning). It’s like I have good days or good moments then instantly bam I’m like I’m not real. I just wanna know I’m not alone I guess.. ",1,1730562567.0,Depersonalization,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend needs constant female validation and attention, has a lot of female friends. Was seeing his ex and broke my trust. ","This will be a longer post, as I’d like some objective thoughts.

I met my boyfriend at the beginning of the year and was immediately smitten with him. Everything seemed great—we were in nonstop communication from day one. He was funny, thoughtful, and attentive, always engaged in our conversations. Early on, he began mentioning a female friend, and on our second date, he spoke a lot about her and her complicated relationship. I found it to be an amusing story and didn’t think much of it. He hadn’t mentioned that she was his best friend or that they shared an especially close bond. (More on her later.)

The first three months went well, and he invited me to his vacation home. I agreed, seeing it as an opportunity to get to know him better and deepen our connection by spending uninterrupted time together.

This is where things began to fall apart. On our way there, we ran into another female friend of his. He left me alone for 30 minutes to talk to her without introducing me, which made me anxious. When we arrived at the house, he started avoiding me and was constantly on his phone—unlike when we’d gone on dates before. This struck me as strange, but I didn’t assume anything was wrong. Later that day, when he showed me something on his phone, a message notification from another girl popped up. He quickly hid his phone and left the house, saying he needed to call his father. I followed him, but he insisted on taking the call alone and walked off, leaving me in his house. I was uneasy, but I tried to chalk it up to first-time nerves about being alone together in an unfamiliar place.

The next day, he continued to avoid me. We had no plans, and I spent my time on this beautiful island he loves, mostly alone in the house. We didn’t go for a walk, a swim, or anything. I told him I felt lonely, confused, and wanted to go home. He apologized, promised to give me his full attention, and said he’d stay off his phone. The next day, while we were talking on the terrace, I realized the notifications he’d been hiding were from his ex-girlfriend. He admitted they’d been seeing each other and talking during the months we’d been dating, as she wanted to get back together with him. I was devastated. I packed my things the next day, broke things off, and went home.

The next week, he sent a gift to my office, then called when he knew I’d received it. We started talking again, and I decided to give him another chance. Things were better than ever, but I still felt anxious, insecure, and didn’t fully trust him. This led to frequent fights.

Now, about his friend…

I met his female best friend randomly on one of our dates. She greeted him with a hug around the neck, ignored me, and, after he introduced us, remarked, “Oh, so where were you two lovebirds? You’re not going to a midnight movie, are you?” I was irritated but didn’t say anything. My boyfriend later mentioned that she had advised him not to tell me about his ex, as it “wasn’t my concern.” I found that disrespectful, and I began to dislike her. They spend a lot of time together—coffees, lunches, evening drinks, constant texts and calls. At first, I didn’t say much, but over time, it began to bother me. During a weekend getaway, she sent him drunken videos from a night out with her friends. That felt like a turning point, where their friendship crossed a line. My boyfriend is her go-to support, often hanging out with her and her friends alone. After the videos, she also began sending him shopping hauls and even suggested he should break up with me. I told him I felt uncomfortable with how close they were and that it would help if she apologized and tried to befriend me. She responded by calling me “crazy” and saying she didn’t care about my discomfort.

He’s since started commenting on other women’s looks around me and has more one-on-one hangouts with different women. He even went paddleboarding with a girl on the island. I’m not okay with this. It’s not about jealousy or insecurity; I simply prefer clear boundaries in a relationship. I want my partner to be devoted and to have limits with other women. He’s also begun liking and following random women on Instagram and TikTok. He told me he doesn’t see a difference between men and women and considers everyone “just friends,” with social media as just “pages on the internet.”

As our fights became daily, he told me his ex never argued with him about these things and that his mother thinks I’m making him unhappy by bringing up my concerns. He later admitted he craves constant validation from women and isn’t sure why. Since then, he’s started therapy, cut ties with his female best friend, stopped hanging out with women, blocked his ex, and unfollowed all the girls on social media. I can see he loves me and genuinely wants things to work out, but my trust is gone. I find myself constantly revisiting the past and these situations, and I don’t want to feel like I’m controlling him or forbidding anything.

Should I end this relationship, or is it okay to accept the changes he’s making and his apologies? I’m in a state of constant fear and resentment at even the mention of other women, and I struggle with him talking to or being around women in general. We’re spending less and less time together because of all the arguments. I really love him and felt a deep connection, thinking I’d found my person.

some more info on my roommate: 

she has lived with us on and off since i was 8 years old and has maybe paid us rent/had a job for like 1/4 of that time. same thing with having a car, she likes to get cars and stop paying the payments and drive around with no tag until they eventually repo it. shes a stuck up bitch who came from money and now thinks shes this like all knowing perfect person whos better than everyone else when shes rlly just a bum. one time in my old house she had these two cats (not the same ones as now) and she would keep them in this empty bedroom we had and never cleaned the litter box so they ended up shitting in the room so much to the point where we had to get the carpet removed. also in that same house in her room she secretly smoked cigs in her room (even tho my gma said to do it outside) UNTIL THE WALLS TURNED YELLOWWWW. i dont have my license but i do have a car and we let her use it for a few months until it broke down and it turns out she didn't check the oil a single time bc she thought i was doing it (i had never driven the car before and dont know how to change oil) and then we discovered she TRASHED my car with cigs too. she is constantly trying to provoke me with political stuff to debate with her bc she knows we dont agree on things (you literally cant debate her because she fully believes everything she says is right and gets loud and wont let you talk). she is so fucking loud and never respects when people are trying to sleep (once again i live in a trailer and if you've ever lived in one you would know the walls are THIN so i hear everything). i literally cant even go into my kitchen or bathroom for two seconds before she comes out her room and starts yapping my ear off abt baby stuff idgaf abt or tries to provoke me into debating her. i literally hate leaving my room because of her and over the past few months have become a borderline shut in in here. (i already have rlyyy bad mental health and anxiety so bad im becoming agoraphobic and shes not helping at all) 

the thing with the baby and her daughter being here also pisses me off because like yes i sympathize with the poor baby bc of my cousins shit ass parenting and neglect. my cousin doesn't even want anything to do with the baby and just locks herself in my roommates room so now shes on a couch next to the crib right next to my bedroom door. my house is now divided by babygates bc their cats hate my dog and their cats piss and shit everywhere and it just makes the house feel so cramped. the roommate also did not ask if she could move them in here and then it put us in a situation where my grandma is the bad guy if we said no or kicked them out. THEY DONT EVEN PAY RENT OR ANYTHING AND SHE HASNT HAD A JOB SINCE BEFOREEEE THEY MOVED IN. 

im trying rlly hard to try to find a job to help my grandma with bills so we literally dont lose our house but its so frustrating knowing that im pretty much finna be paying her rent. bc like obviously my grandma isnt gonna ask me for rent bc ive lived with her my whole life but it feels like what im gonna be contributing is just gonna make up for the rent shes not paying (plus now that shes not working my gma pays for her coffee and phone and cigarettes and i dont like thinking about the fact that my money to help my grandma is going to be used on some bum) 

and then i feel guilty for being mad abt this because id feel terrible making a disabled baby homeless so it just sucks bc theres not much we can do. like i don't dislike the baby or have anything against it i just cant with all the screaming and chaos and i just want my house to actually feel like MY house and not have to be locked in my room 24/7 bc i dont wanna interact with them or it (i dont like babies, no i dont wanna hold it, no i dont wanna play with it, no i dont wanna hear abt the her doctors appointments etc. i dont have anything against the baby i just dont wanna interact it it and dont care to hear abt it every time i try to leave my room)

and then like now the babys doctors are going to start coming to my house for physical therapy but its so embarrassing because i recently found out my house stinks like cat piss and we are all nose blind to it. (ik damn well its not my cat because she uses her own literbox and goes outside with me) and then my dog is this big scary looking pit bull (actually a giant baby) and gets superrrr excited and jumps on them or barks and cries the whole time hes in my gmas room. i just hate this whole situation and its so embarrassing and frustrating.


AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS TOO, THEY ARE ACTUALLY SO FREAKING GROSS. LIKE SHE SMOKES CIGARETTES IN THE HOUSE AND IN MY CAR AND LEAVES THEM EVERYWHERE AND WHEN SHE DID IT OUTSIDE SHE USED ONE OF MY GRANDMAS PLANTS INTO AN ASHTRAY. SHE DOESNT CLEAN HER LITERBOX, DOESNT CLEAN UP AFTER HERSELF, DOESNT WASH DISHES, BUT FOR SOME REASON IS DOING LAUNDRY EVERY SINGLE DAY SOMETIMES MULTIPLE LOADS A DAY OR LETS IT SIT THERE SOGGY UNTIL THEYRE GROSS AND NEED TO BE WASHED AGAIN. YESTERDAY I MY LOOFA WAS KNOCKED ONTO THE SHOWER FLOOR IN A PUDDLE OF WATER FULLLLL OF PUBES AND MY RAZOR WAS FULL OF THEM.

I've been searching through google and keep finding conflicting answers, so I figured I'd make a post and see if anyone has solid input. I am a brand new streamer and have an IT background so I'm relatively educated when it comes to tech, however audio is my weak point.

  
I have a Stream Deck +, and my goal right now is to be able to **separate all of my audio and be able to utilize the dials** on my device to adjust everything so I'd have a specific audio source for my game volume, discord volume, spotify, etc. I want to be able to setup a page of dials where adjusting these audio sources would **change the volume for what I'm streaming, as well as a second page that will adjust the audio for me.**

For example, on page one *if I turn up the Spotify volume, it will be a little louder for my stream and then turn it down on the second page to make it quiet in my earbuds*. Or page one I could turn down discord volume so the stream can't hear the chatter, but turn it up on page two so I'm able to heard the voice chat better without affecting stream.

First question is, *would something like this be possible?* Second question is **how would I go about doing it?** I have seen a few suggestions for third party software, but I don't know what would work best or which would be compatible with OBS and the stream deck. 

**Thank you** very much for any advice or input on this, and if there's anyone who is very confident in their ability to set something like this up and can walk me through it via a discord screen share I'd love to buy you a coffee or a beer for your time.",1,1730561820.0,elgato,0,1.0,False
1ghz5fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1ghz5fl/what_do_i_do_now/,What do I do now,"I (24F) have had pretty severe anxiety for as long as I can remember. I get panic attacks when I become overwhelmed, and I can be overwhelmed not only by pressure but also overstimulation. Sometimes just being in a packed store makes me feel like I'm drowning.

I have a lot of anxiety about a lot of things. In many ways I am a capable person, and even when I'm anxious or becoming anxious, I know I have a very convincing mask I wear around others. Such as: talking to a bank teller or asking for directions. These things frighten me but I can push through. I don't tend to doom spiral into panic about most things, but I am constantly overwhelmed when I feel fear. It feels like a truly disproportionate amount of fear. I feel silly about it. I can usually think clearly and not understand why I am scared. And yikes, I feel like I get adrenaline spikes about stupid things for no reason, and the adrenaline lingers! Rude. Ugh, I am kind of constantly crying, probably to get rid of all the excess stress I accrue. I feel gross about it.

I was going to name some stand-out things that I don't fear for context, but as I'm writing this, I realize that it isn't that I don't fear them, and they still give me a lot of anxiety, I just push it down and have to recharge about it later. Lame. 

Anywho,

I recently got my first job ever (been in college, dropped out because,,, anxiety. Wee.). I zone apparel at the local Walmart 5-6 days a week. It has been just one week. I love zoning (tidying the salesfloor products) and I even feel kind of fulfilled completing those tasks, but I have come to realize I can't handle the people. I hate being talked to, I hate being in a loud, people-dense place for 8-9 hours a day. I am exhausted. I want to quit. I feel ashamed that I want to quit. I have had two whole panic attacks this week, and been on the edge a couple more times, and good hell do they remove all of my resolve and energy for days. I don't have downtime to recharge in between shifts and I feel like I have already asked for too many accommodations. 

My wife works at this same Walmart, in a different department. It should be worth noting I can't drive because my largest and most vicious fear is driving/vehicles on the road. I WILL panic if I am in the driver's seat. Some days it isn't easy to be a passenger either. My wife is my angel and she drives me places, and she really enjoys driving, thankfully. 

Anyway, my wife is wanting me to consider what I need and to be nice to myself. She wants me to look for a job that I would not dread AND that I can feel proud of. She suggested remote work. I am going to look into that right after I write this and have some coffee. 

I'll also note that I've been to doctors and therapists about my anxiety. Nobody has really believed me about my levels of anxiety. My therapists have told me to ""just push through"" or have told me that I shouldn't be anxious about whatever I'm talking about, and that's it. They haven't believed me when I told them about my feelings about driving, they just tell me to practice and I'll be fine. I don't go to therapy anymore. My doctors have treated me like I'm blowing it out of proportion. I was diagnosed with mild generalized anxiety and mild depression. I do not feel listened to, but then I wonder if I AM blowing it out of proportion, and they see that, and I'm making things up, and I need to do better at being a person... 
(Just for information, I also have been diagnosed with ADHD and I have medication that really helps for that.)

I feel ashamed to be me. I feel useless, like a burden, like a leech because my father still pays my bills because I am a coward and I can't do anything. It is crushing. I want to be useful. I want to be independent. I want to save up and have the money to purchase a home with my wife. I think my wife is the only person who actually believes in me, and I will not let her down. That is my greatest real fear. 

I just need advice. In general. Job advice, Healthcare advice, motivational advice. 

I need to hear from other people who suffer like this. I realize I don't think I ever really have. I've just been told to grow up or to toughen up. I feel like a child but also like I am actually crazy.

Please. I feel worthless and like a failure and I need ideas on how to get moving again. 
For the record, I'm not prone to self-harm. I am okay, just really mired in self-doubt. I'll be happy to answer any questions.

My special interest is horses however I don’t come from a wealthy horsey family and for anyone who’s not horsey basically its just a really tough industry to get in if you aren’t bred into it or can pay your way into it. My mam was talking about me maybe getting a part time job at a small local coffee shop and it suddenly popped into her head that she has a friend of 30 years with an understaffed racing yard so she shot him a text Thursday and popped over this morning before my riding lesson.

I thought I would absolutely despise it and ask her to come and pick me up after half an hour but I stayed until I actually had to go! If you don’t know much about racing basically the horses are very young (don’t agree with it but that’s another conversation) and 9/10 very very hot. As my horse is very chill and very old I’m not very experienced with hot babies so all the handling I did was minimal. I took a few of the chiller fillies to and from the walker, mucked out some stables with the owners dad, cleaned water buckets, groomed a few, rugged a few, watched a fillies first ride, that sort of stuff. 

As for the social aspect I got on great! This may be weird but I’m actually quite good at talking to adults but struggle with keeping a conversation. The owner, his dad and the other groom copped on and were able to keep it going for me and included me in their conversations which I found really sweet. Racing is far from my favourite discipline but I really liked this yard. Very clean (as far as a mostly family ran yard with 30+ horses can be), all the horses were happy, everyone was very gentle and every horse was turned out at the end of the day when they were done with their exercise. Also there was a horse from America missing an eye which was really cool to see in person! Here’s a picture of a colt named woody who was obsessed with playing with my cap and licking my face.",10,1730561718.0,AutismInWomen,7,1.0,False

Saturday mornings are my favorite. It’s always a slow time, a slow wake up. Casually getting coffee, staying in my PJs, sitting down on the couch to read, listen to music, watch TV, or just sit in silence. if it nicer day, I’ll then go on a walk. But I love how slow it is, compared to my weekdays.

This morning I decide to listen to my music. It is a gorgeous autumn day. I’m in a really great headspace excited for plans with friends later. 

So, of course I choose Gregory. But I choose Gregory like three or four times a week. And I have for the last three years. Other artists come and go in my life. Or some I listen to more than others at times for chapters in my life. But I’ve celebrated some of my happiest days with Gregory playing “Sweet Heat Lightening” in the background. I have also screamed my face off in tears with my last breakup blasting “If I Go, I’m Goin” and “San Luis.”

Day dreaming of all the memories with my current boyfriend, the healthiest relationship I’ve ever experienced. The trauma, continuing to heal through “Appaloosa Bones.” Feeling a sense of connection with the words “I’m glad you found me when you did,” what a profound statement to help me put into words my appreciation for my partner and the gift of a relationship we share with each other. 

I have three tour posters on my wall and nobody ever knows who he is and it’s fun to try explain my love of calm folk/americana followed by “but I swear it’s not country!!” 😅 I am born and raised in the Appalachias of Virginia and I’m sure my love of bluegrass connects memories. The slow banjo brings me back to my childhood as I sit here in my apartment in the city. 

And yes there’s similar artists but I swear the composition and poetry of his music is wildly unique. So watching this artist grow over the years, while also being proud of a complete stranger. Excited to see new fans while also knowing that they will never know his earlier years and those intimate small shows. 

So what I’m trying to say is that I am a fan. And I’ve never really been a fan of an artist this much. honestly, I think Gregory caters to my love and need for calm music due to trauma and my (sometimes shaky) mental health. And that’s fine, that’s life. But oh how I appreciate this man and the beauty he creates. ",9,1730561403.0,GregoryAlanIsakov,2,1.0,False

Filmmaker writing a screenplay. Researching tech, startups, FAANG and specifically interested to meet Stanford students that went to Paly, Gunn or Menlo Atherton with a parent or parents in tech. Comments and DMs also very welcome.","Hello there Stanford students--

Pretty new here so if I don’t follow protocols correctly, I apologise in advance. Feel free to tell me where I’m going wrong.

I’m an English screenwriter, director and producer based in London UK, researching the culture and psychology of tech, Palo Alto and Silicon Valley. Have been been meeting engineers and others in (big tech and startups) in person this week. Am staying in an AirBnB next to Paly / campus, here till Thursday lunchtime.

This is for a feature film I’m writing (working title: SOLID STATE)—currently a revenge psychological drama--and also for a short film to serve as a promo to raise finance.

My last film, [THE ELECTRICITY IN ME](https://directorslibrary.com/01/2023/latest/short-films/narrative-short/the-electricity-in-me/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZxMrbF3AhvH7lBFmFpqmPdw4T6q87DipB-KZusQnEqWa8eaUitQntOboI_aem_9SsPJtk5ttFkINF78stalQ), also a short, was accepted into 23 festivals in total, a number of which were BAFTA/Academy accredited, premiered in HollyShorts Festival at the legendary Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard and won three awards. You can see my films here [www.AESTHETIK.film](http://www.aesthetik.film/).

So--I'm interested in a couple of specifics: 

(1) How having parents in tech (big tech and startups) impacts on family life, if at all. Or maybe you didn't really notice or care.

(2) Parental expectations regarding academic performance, grades, additional activities which would help you get into college.

(3) What the environment is like in local high schools? There are many many posts about the additional pressures there are to attend high school here, as a young person, but as I've found, Reddit posts do not tell the whole story though have been helpful.

So, if people want to take advantage of the offer of free coffee, lunch or dinner, I’d be very interested to hear your insights, even if only for 20 or 30 mins. I know you're busy, so will be as efficient as your schedule requires.

Absolutely no obligation to say any personal details about your family or indeed (as I've been saying to the techs I've met) you don't even need to tell me your name... DMs, comments very (very) welcome also.

Happy to meet on campus, downtown, wherever you feel most comfortable. And, you're very welcome to bring a friend(s) too if you'd prefer. 

thanks in advance

1ghyzis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1ghyzis/help_me_analyse_my_behaviour_at_work_and_at_home/,Help me analyse my behaviour at work and at home. ,"Bit of background:

I'm final year undergrad engineering student. I'm  also doing an internship. The internship is coding related and is hybrid i.e I have to be offline 2 days a week and wfh for remaining weekdays. I live in my college hostel. 



Now to main issue:

I am struggling with being able to do focused work. Main reasons for my lack of focus or rather constant distractions is mostly my loneliness. My brain constantly reminds me how I don't have any friends. (people with whom I can be vulnerable, I do have friends with whom I do things like going out, bantering or working on something)
My brain imagines how certain circumstances from past would have unfolded differently if I had said something different. It reminds me of all the cringe things I did, and tries to make me believe that that's why someone left me. It creates scenarios for the future, these scenarios consists of a version of myself that has survived self harm or is going to therapy and has close friends.

These things occupy my brain so much that it hurts all the time. As coping mechanism my brain keeps me taking back to doom scrolling reddit or YouTube. 
When I say doom scrolling YouTube, I'm just scrolling the home page or jumping videos without actually watching them. This happens when I'm in my hostel room or classroom. 

It gets worse when I'm completely alone in my room. 
I end up watching porn for hours at a stretch, multiple times a day. Like a session can go upto 3-5 hours then I eat something, sleep for few hours then repeat.(Although it's very rare, like couple of consecutive days in 3-4 months, it scares the shit out of me about my future, when I'll be leaving alone in rented house).



A ray of hope:

During working in the office I observed that somehow voices in my brain got quiter. 
My day at office looked something like following:

Arrive around 11, make a list of things I want to work on for the day. Get a coffee and start working. I try to write down whatever I'm doing which helps me not lose track of what I am doing. 
By 12:30 or 1PM I go for lunch with my colleagues, they are very nice people with geniune interest in what they are working on. By 1:30 I'm back on my desk. After this Im mostly able to sustain my focus for couple of hours at a time. 
After every couple of hours I automatically end up taking small break for coffee and I just stretch and walk around a bit. I do this till 6-7 PM. Somehow I'm able to checkout atleast half of the tasks by the end of the day. 
This makes me feel better about myself. It makes me feel that I'm improving and I won't endup going insane  or killing myself. 



Now all I have to do is somehow replicate this when I'm doing WFH. I don't mean to become workaholic, but rather be able to focus on the things that matter in the present. It can be work, or personal project or just hanging out with friends. I want to focus and enjoy these things rather than letting my brain run on autopilot destruction mode. 




Tldr: 

My brain runs on autopilot destruction mode all the time. Which makes it impossible to focus on work , studying or even social engagements. But this chaos almost vanishes when I'm in office. And I'm able to do focused work and achieve goals I set to some extent.
Now I want my brain to act like how it acts like when I'm in office. So I can replace work with my personal projects or social engagements or just personal hobbies like reading.",1,1730561367.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

So - Pebble still working as a watch, and the onboard apps (I use a rugby refereeing app, for example) still working fine, but just as a mini-computer-strapped-to-my-wrist, not as a smartwatch.

I feel as if I’m losing so much sense of time and reality like I’m even getting confused on what days of the week it is. Everyday I’m anxious and nervous and scared right now. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this or just some kind words. Feeling really defeated and lost & scared at the moment. Just want this to go away.

I’ve only ever had this like from THC but I triggered myself doing some c*ke at a party & now I’m all messed up again.  I also think I maybe have (self diagnosed) ocd & that’s why these loops happen that I get stuck with idk. I keep reading doomed things are people saying they’re halluncinating or getting psychosis from this and it’s freaking me the hell out and making it so much worse. My biggest fear is that like this reality is not real and I can’t shake the feeling as is. I would say I am getting good sleep but it sucks waking up and feeling like it immediately (this morning). It’s like I have good days or good moments then instantly bam I’m like I’m not real. I just wanna know I’m not alone I guess.. ",2,1730560991.0,derealization,0,1.0,False

Please put spoilers in comment if you talk the quest after that.

1. Most of companion quest is ""go together"", this is good, I enjoy Harding's >!being excited earth bender and we encourage her during her practice!<. Bellara's >!tinkling obsessed mode because of her family!<, Neve's / Lucanis's >!""date"" in their hometown (so far the sweet kiss coffee is so good loll)!<. I haven't even touched Davrin's and other companions, so excited for it.

2. Varric's reassurance talk is the most enjoyable dialogue I got from this game. >!I didn't remember in the past game we can ask ""was I making a bad decision?"" to anyone and this Varric right here, calling me kid, reassure me that sometimes a hard decision, and it's okay that not everyone agrees with you!<.

3. Bellara and Neve's early conversation.. >!hmm is this some sort of teasing what's gonna happen? There was an option to leave their conversation, but I did stay for the hope they get togehter!<.

4. Bellara and Harding's Banter. Now this one is the closest dialogue that mentions a lore. >!I love how Bellara started singing some lullaby and Harding connected it to her Stone study, this is the kind of banter I'm waiting for, I will keep them together for a while!<. In case anyone didn't get it, you have to trigger Harding's quest, Bellara and Harding should discuss about Alarthan in the kitchen, then take them together during exploration.

5. Oh right! I enjoy how the companions don't just stay in one place at lighthouse, sometimes it could gave them talk with another companions and more banter in exploration.

6. About writing kinda off, maybe they toned down a bit for new players playing the game? And the fact that we can only talk to them if there's quest progress, eliminate the ideas to ask in detail about their background.

Obviously remembering to do it is half the battle, but once I remembered to do it I didn't want to because I hated the aftertaste of the mint, and the weird combination of mint and whatever I happened to eat or drink beforehand. (I do like the taste of mint, but not the mint in toothpaste, and usually it's too minty and it kinda burns a bit for me.) Enter my genius: kid's toothpaste. Specifically chocolate flavored toothpaste. (None of that bubblegum shit, unless you like it, you do you.) I LOVE chocolate, and in my opinion it's not an offensive flavor to have after eating or drinking coffee. It's like having dessert! But you're taking care of your teeth! It's a win win! Because really, the mint doesn't do anything. The mint is a flavoring that we now associate with being clean and fresh, but honestly has no bearing on whether you're actually clean and fresh. The kind I'm trying out and loving is the Theodent chocolate chip flavor kids toothpaste, and it's delicious. I've seen some others on Amazon but I haven't tried those. If you're not a chocolate person, the Boka brand has an orange creamsicle toothpaste that's also really good. Is this an expensive toothpaste? Yeah, kinda. But will it help me take care of my teeth? Hopefully, at least more often than I did before, and I count that as a win. So I'll pay that ADHD tax.",3,1730560020.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

","I have unmediated ADHD, so if I can’t exercise regularly (insert adult responsibilities here), I would drink coffee or energy drinks all day long, thinking that it fulfilled my brains craving for stimulants. ADHD medications overstimulated me and made me irritable, impatient, no sleep, etc. I never suspected that caffeine could be causing the same problems. 

I’ve drastically reduced my caffeine intake in the past month. Down from 400-600mg/day to one cup of coffee with the 5mg of creatine in the morning. What I’ve been realizing since reducing my caffeine, and simultaneously sugar, intakes, is that I am sleeping MUCH better, energy levels are getting MUCH better, irritability is drastically reduced, acid reflux drastically reduced. 

I’m simply amazed. Coffee and caffeine and “sugar free healthy” energy drinks and caffeine loaded pre-workout drinks etc. are thrown in our face daily. It’s so hard to see the light and truth about how fogged up they can make your brain. I’m so happy I found this sub and started my path to caffeine free.

We have had our issues, arguments, fights to the point of almost divorcing so many times but never about infedelities. He is a hard working man. He works in the field with tractors and stuff I know nothing about. He used to work like 3 hours away from where we were living and would only come home on weekends and sometimes, when it got busy, only every 14 days. Until I decided to move to where he was working. He would sometimes work all night.  A couple times when he came home early, he would smell of perfume. I'd ask him about it and he said that he had no idea where it came from and he couldn't smell any perfume and I'd just let it go and didn't think about it anymore.  Recently I have started getting itchy in my private parts and I thought it was anotcher infection. Because of my body's weak defenses, caused by my very poor eating habits through all my teenage years and a little into my twenties, I'm no stranger to UTIs, and have been hospitalized because of it during my pregnancy.  Until one night I noticed some small blister looking appearences down there. But my husband was sleeping so went to sleep too.  The next morning when we woke up, my husband suggested we go buy breakfast cuz he was hungry so we did that. When we got home, I made myself a cup of coffee and a cup of tea for him while I told him about the blisters.  He told me to google it and told him that I did and it said it might be STDs. I told him I don't think it was STDs because that would mean one of us had slept with someone else and he got quiet for a bit.  Then started saying that you can also just get an STD out of nowhere and it doesn't mean there was another person involved and that I probably just got an infection because of the chemicals we works with, which I thought was totally possible. Then he got up, without even touching his tea or the food we had just bought and when I asked him if we wasn't gonna eat, he said he wasn't hungry and got up to go to work.  When I saw him backing up to leave for work without saying goodbye to me or our daughter, I went outside to go tell him goodbye but he was as if lost in his thoughts and just left.

1ghydz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1ghydz8/holiday_season_stress/,Holiday season stress,"Already dreading the holiday season. My MIL just makes it impossible to have a good time. I don't recall her being like this since I met her but definitely there were red flags that I ignored as I hadn't realized. 
Seems she has an idea of what people should do and if they don't do it she gets upset. For example: I spend a week vacation in her house (she lives 500miles from me). Turned out I am allergic (sneezing, coughing, runny nose) to something in her house (which I thought was kind of cool since I had never experienced any allergy previously). My MIL and GF(now wife) took me to store and they recommended some medication for allergy, it made me drowsy and I took a nap in afternoon. MIL took offense to the nap. Sometime later I saw the drowsy warning and told my GF, she explained to MIL and as far as I know that one case ended. 
Throughout the years she has done multiple things that I don't talk to her at all. Seems any time I say something it gets turned around to be used negatively against me. For example: 7 adults 3kids in one bathroom apartment, while just us 3 were in the apartment I mentioned ""if either of you need to use restroom now is the best time, the others will arrive soon"" she took it as 'just because he is a man he thinks he can boss us girls around'. 
She once started telling my wife that guys who travel for work cheat, in front of me. 
As for the cheating, I've never cheated on my wife at any point of our dating, engaged, married lives, 15years with one woman. I used to travel for work and it was messed up for her to go on a rant about traveling guys cheat, to my wife as I returned from a work trip. She didn't say my name and instead used the name of my MIL BIL, my uncle in law. But the timing, plus that work trip was to a country many people consider to be a romantic getaway.
My wife knows all my passwords, and phone/PC pins.
For years she would constantly say that she told me she wasn't giving away her daughter in our wedding, she could take my wife back when she wanted. 
Initially I didn't even read much into the ""taking her daughter back"" story. My wife started to take offense to it, as my MIL would tell that story to everyone. From my wife POV it started to sound like MIL was referring to my wife as a piece of property, which upset me for two reasons (wife is upset and someone insinuating she is property like a pet). As MIL Said that story to someone who has a dark sense of humor, they asked her ""would she? Would she go back with you?"" That was the last time I heard the ""I will take her back"" story.  
She got upset cause my wife got COVID during the out of country vacation that my MIL came with us. 
Last time MIL came visit she said our baby needed a specific hat, which I was shocked and speechless thinking why would my baby need a ""porno hat""? Later my wife explained to me it was a political hat... I'm not against people having their own beliefs on politics and religion. I disagree with multiple friends political views but still am able to hear their POV and state mine and not be offended, but not with my MIL. Regardless, using my baby for a political stunt is not acceptable to me. 
MIL is coming to visit us for thanksgiving. When she visits she seems to expect me to be happy and glad to see her, but I kind of am an AH now and just give her the cold shoulder. I'll ask my wife instead, for example of I am making coffee: ""does your mom want coffee"", yeah MIL is in the room but I don't want to 'Boss her around'.
My MIL thinks that ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" is an acceptable apology to me. She raised her concerns to my wife, my wife told her I was still upset; my MIL just went into ""well then I'm going to keep doing my thing"". Seems thatast visit my MIL tone changed from ""poor me he is ignoring me"" to ""oh well"". 
My MIL acts like the victim while attacking me. I kept on not wanting to upset my wife and would let MIL be rude. But in recent years my wife has started to allow me to ""go off leash"" to her mom. And so I went nuclear once!
My MIL for years made herself sound as she would be part of our out of the country trip. We've been wanting to go visit my family for years but money... One year we did go with the main purpose of the trip visit and spend time with my grandfather that had cancer. I had raised my concerns to my wife but my wife was optimistic and I hoped to be wrong. Horrible vacation it was. The 10humans in one apartment was the least of the issue. A day or two before our return, I saw my wife going through my luggage and I asked her what was she looking for... My MIL passport?!?! No idea why my luggage would be considered high in the list of places.  After the trip my MIL stayed in our house for one or 2 days before going to her house. During her last morning as I am getting my coffee and she is waiting for can to get her to train station, she decided to ""give me a talk"" I was not in good mood; jet lag, no coffee, ruined vacation, now a MIL who wants to victimize herself while making me to be AH, I was about to let her go off and stay quiet then one of dogs started to puke, as I looked to my wife whom was curled up in the sofa looking close to crying. I was then holding a dog over the kitchen sink cursing at my MIL. She STFU when I flipped the switch but once dog finished puking and I put dog on the floor I raised my volume higher. 
My MIL waled out and waited for cab outside, my wife joined her, to say goodbye and such. My wife then tells me ""she doesn't know why you flipped on her and why you were screaming"". 
She also thinks that me getting upset about open scissors in sofa or her stitching needles on floor is me being OCD. To her it can't be me thinking safety of my wife's barefoot in the house or two dogs or the most recent incident our baby grabbing a box of pins/needles in coffee table and dropping them on the floor. 
When she is here, she uses outside voice, she will not stop talking and usually the two things she talks about: negative topics or telling us the same stories; if someone says something she will interrupt them. 
She seems to feed on drama and says a lot of sexist things as well. I really don't appreciate it, especially in front of our 1yo. While the 1yo won't remember it, I don't want this behavior in front of the baby years from now when kids start to mimic people around.
My wife has sided with me most times. My wife doesn't like confrontation and understandably doesn't like upsetting her mom, she has been getting better and standing up for herself. 
On my side of the family, we won't sugar coat anything if something is wrong, we will talk it as it is and tell curse each other as needed. Might go no contact for days or weeks but we end up coming back and either apologize or just not repeating something, which shows respect and shows we listened to each other. 
My MIL wants to have people bend to her and just be ""that's how she is"" but I don't feel like I owe her anything to bend down to her. 
I am not the perfect person and not the best husband but I don't feel like I am as bad as she makes me feel.

Still dreading the holidays. Dreading her imposing to stay longer than what we are comfortable with, dreading the negativity, dreading the no quietness in the house, dreading the confrontations. Wish my MIL was From Hell, at least she could feel warmer... 
I needed to vent. Sorry for long post.     ",3,1730559731.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,1.0,False

I stayed at the Novotel Ambassador in Yongsan. Great hotel, no complaints. I probably would prefer to stay in Myeongdong or Insadong next time just for proximity to more historic sites. I like to add breakfast to my hotel rate as nice hotels have a huge breakfast and you know you’ll start the day with a full belly. I also recommend getting a hotel with a spa so you can do the whole Korean sauna experience. 
The subway and the busses are very easy to navigate. Get a t-card as soon as you get to town and add 15-20k won on it. I think I used about 12k won over five days. I took the airport limousine bus to/from my hotel and it was very easy to figure out with some research before you leave. You buy the ticket at the airport (lower level) and then pay for the return with cash on the bus or they let you pay with a card when you get to the airport. 
I visited several areas: 
Yongsan was kinda lame, not too much going on there expect for…Itaewon, which felt kind a different neighborhood, and was great if you want to drink/party with an international crowd. It did not feel very authentic but sometimes it’s nice to feel a little bit of home. Sidebar….Koreans don’t do small talk and you probably won’t have much luck striking up a conversation with random people. If you’re a social person but not with a big group Itaewon is probably your best bet for the nightlife scene. 
Insadong is great for seeing the palace and souvenir shopping. Definitely has the big city feel to it and you can do all the touristy stuff.
Myeodong is nuts, great shopping, fun markets, seems like it’s the heart of Seoul. If you like adidas or Nike you can make custom clothes at their stores. Arrive before opening to get a time slot. 
Seongsu is super hipster, the Brooklyn of Seoul. It’s the old warehouse district that has become super trendy. Great upscale and vintage shopping with awesome coffee shops. 
Hongdae is great, college area. I did not go this trip but had a wonderful time there before. 
Gangnam/everything south of the Han seems very nice. It reminds me of the northern Virginia area around Washington DC. Great restaurants, feels very upscale, lotte tower is probably worth a visit for the views. 
Other-
I love Naksam park and the walk up the city walls. Amazing views from the top. 
I’ll take some heat for this but overall  the food is just ok. Korean BBQ is amazing, a lot of the sashimi is very good. Street foods are really good. Everything else, for the most part, is kind of blah. 
Must have apps: NAVER is the best for all things map-ish. I used it all the time, especially for transit. Kakao maps was also good and I used it more like a Yelp
to find good places to eat close by. Korea Subway app was very helpful for me as it showed a traditional view of the subway lines all in English. Papago was my favorite translation app which I used to take pictures of things written in Korean so I could see the translation. I never used a language app to try to communicate. Most people spoke enough English to help me along if I was confused.

I’ve been nervous since yesterday because this is a group trip and I’m worried about his drinking and the problem this outing could cause. He assured me it’s ok. So this morning he got upset because I suggested he help me prepare for the trip instead of gaming. I thought I was in a “safe zone” I was ignored. I then asked him several times what he’d like for breakfast because I’m anticipating if he eat a bowl of cereal he’ll quietly be upset about it all day.. he was annoyed I asked him a few time what he’d like. He said he’d eat cereal. I told my son to help mom out by eating and getting some clothes together. Husband says what do you need help with? Then I said you know what y’all can do for me.. take out the garbage and feed the cats. That’s it. He ended up turning off the game getting upset and saying that he feels that he has to turn it off or else I’m gonna bitch?? I told him I don’t bitch.. I actually refrain from doing that as it causes issues when I “complain” I got so anxious because my body and mind know what he’s doing! He’s causing a problem and blaming me so that he can either check out and say he’s not going on the trip or he’ll go and definitely drink too much and blame me! I can’t get a refund I’m so stressed and we have 3 hrs bed we’re supposed to leave. He did in fact say he’s not going. If I leave he’ll just start binge drinking again.

That said, this morning I pulled one of the best shots I’ve ever pulled. The coffee I had been drinking for a week on an expobar tasted so different I wouldn’t have recognized it, which sounds dramatic but it was a dramatic difference. Right after I channeled my wife’s shot and she said it still tasted better, just not as good as mine. 

  I bet a breville with a slayer mod would have been so much better for the price (lmlm slayer mod too), but I also wouldn’t just sit down and stare at my machine.

  It’s been a long journey of a thrift store espresso machine for 20usd, manual rok for 50usd, ascaso dream as a gift, la Cara mínimo lever for 120, expobar dual boiler for 300, and this slayer for **** (I shouldn’t even say).

To give you a little background, my condition was triggered out of nowhere during covid times, back in 2021. I passed all the pulmonology function tests, yet the doctor gave me a steroid inhaler and whatnot. The problem eventually went away on its own. Since then I have been experiencing this condition at least once a year. It comes and goes on its own. I had a session with my psychiatrist and he thinks it’s anxiety and he has put me on Esciptalopram and Etizolam. I think the meds had a mild effect (though these gave me constipation), but two weeks in and I'm still going through this issue. It appeared out of nowhere and it’s hard to believe it’s anxiety when I'm not even anxious. Doc thinks it’s GAD but I believe it could be related to acidity. I noticed my condition got triggered around the time my black coffee intake got increased. Since I have been in this boat before, I'm positive I will get out of it soon. I even have a gastro appointment lined up. But my question to fellow Redditors is whether someone who suffers from the same issue has shortness of breath that comes and goes. I start panting and run of out breath doing little tasks such as cleaning or even speaking for a long time. Any advice on how to relieve symptoms at home while I wait for the appointment?

>!Alright, let’s get real for a sec. The real IIITN clown has been exposed, and yeah, it’s me. No need to argue – I’ve got the full qualifications for this title, trust me.!<

Picture this: assignments piling up, deadlines flying past like they don’t exist, and my productivity sinking to an all-time low while I scroll through Reddit (and like, 12 other tabs) as a “break” from work I haven’t even started yet. You’d think I’d learn from my mistakes, right? Nope. Procrastination is basically my middle name, and distraction? My bestie.

So here’s a typical day for this professional clown:

1. **Wake Up with Big Plans** 🚀: Every day starts with me convincing myself, “Today, I’m gonna be productive.” I make these intense to-do lists, set goals, even visualize being this focused, put-together person. And then… reality hits.
2. **Start “Studying”** 📚: Or kinda. I open the book, so that *technically* counts, right? 15 minutes in, I remember a YouTube video I wanted to watch, and well, there goes the “study session.”
3. **Re-evaluate My Whole Life** 🧘‍♂️: After like 2 hours of not working, I get into this deep existential crisis, questioning why I’m even here and if college was a good idea to begin with.
4. **Convince Myself There’s “Plenty of Time”** ⏳: I tell myself, “I still have a couple of days before the deadline.” Then somehow “a couple” becomes “oh crap, this is due in like 3 hours.”
5. **Panic Mode** 🚨: By the time I *actually* start working, it’s midnight, and I’m frantically cramming like my life depends on it. Nothing beats the adrenaline rush of realizing you need coffee NOW and then finding out there’s none left. Classic clown move.
6. **Barely Pulling It Off** 🎩: Somehow, thanks to dumb luck and caffeine magic, I end up submitting things just in time. I may be a clown, but hey, I’m a clown with flair.

So yeah, if anyone’s wondering who the true IIITN clown is, it’s me. It’s not just procrastination and distractions – it’s a lifestyle of epic self-sabotage with a hint of optimism. Anyone else out there surviving like this, or am I solo in this clown car? 🎪",6,1730558800.0,iiitn,3,0.87,False

We tried dating briefly at the beginning of 2020, but the pandemic and a bit of distance created tension. He became distant, I ended things, and eventually, he started dating someone else. A few months later, he called & apologized for how things ended, and we reconnected as friends due to our shared industry, where burning bridges isn’t ideal.

Fast forward four years, and we coincidentally end up living in the same city. We kept bumping into each other at local coffee shops, chatting casually, and decided to reconnect as friends. Over time, we began hanging out more frequently, but it was purely platonic.

A couple of months ago, we were catching up, and he mentioned his dating experiences. How no one was catching his interest. Since we were talking relationships, I told him I’d been in an open relationship, which was getting messy. He just listened, and nothing came of it. A month or two later, I was fresh out of that breakup, though he didn’t know it yet. He then asked me out for drinks as a thank-you for a work favor I’d done for him.

In early October, we got those drinks and had an amazing night out — cocktails, arcade games, a rooftop bar, and a lot of talking. He was noticeably flirty. I eventually confided in him about my recent breakup, but I asked him not to “make it weird.” He got even flirtier. We ended up back at his place, where he touched my legs a bit, but nothing happened. I fell asleep in his bed, and he took the couch.

The following week, I invited him over while I was house-sitting nearby. We stayed up until 2 a.m., watching my favorite movie I told him he HAD to watch. The whole time, he was being flirty, touching my legs, and eventually acknowledging, “I think we’re both trying to figure out what we want here.” I told him I was down to hook up, but made it clear that, fresh out of a breakup, I wasn’t looking for romance. I wanted to set that boundary so he wouldn’t feel pressured into anything more than fun and friendship.

We hooked up that night. A few days later, he invited me to work with him at a coffee shop. He was casual, just talking like a friend. I asked if our hookup had made things weird and suggested that if it did, we didn’t have to do it again. He replied that he actually wanted to “do that a bunch more times.” So, a few days later, we met for drinks, talked, and kept things light. He asked what I was doing for Halloween and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‘friend’ was going to be the love interest Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn’t the ONLY thing we did. So we didn’t that night.

Since then, he’s been texting pretty regularly. It’s flirty and fun, and he’s sent me songs with lyrics that hint at “playing it cool when you like someone,” which felt a bit pointed.

Our most recent hangout felt almost like a date. We grabbed chips and margaritas, went antiquing, flirted, and even made out a bit in the store. He slapped my butt a few times, and when I asked about his dating life, he claimed he wasn’t on the apps at the moment and seeing anyone (which I took with a grain of salt). He did ask if I liked the songs he sent, and I casually said yes, dropping the topic afterward.

Later, we ended up back at his place, hooked up, and then cuddled a bit. He asked for my opinion on his apartment decor as I walked around the place in his shirt, but soon left as he had to be up early for work. Afterward, he texted me saying, “Sorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.” I joked that he “kicked me out,” adding that I wouldn’t have minded staying over. He replied nervously with, “Well, the world’s our oyster! Who knows what the future holds 😅.” I told him to calm down, I’m just flirting. 

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might actually have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him saying: ‘idk if casual is for me. Not going to lie, I do have a crush. To keep things simple & stay friends, let’s take a step back, maybe pause on hanging out for a bit. Hope you understand.’

He responded: hi hi hi, sorry for taking so long to respond. I honestly think the friendship is a lot more important than the hooking up part, so if we need to take a step back and pause for a little while I’m perfectly OK with that. I’d rather keep the friendship intact, and I appreciate you saying all this.

I jokingly responded: Pardon my French, but why did I say ‘I like you’ cryptically, & you politely said 'k' lol

He then says: I mean I completely understand, but I didn’t mean to brush it off. Because obviously I like you too but I do still feel that taking a little step back is important for the same reasons I mentioned.

I feel like I come across as needy. I’m not looking for a declaration of feelings from him, but I want to see if we’re on the same page. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me too, but I’m not expecting that.

Last Friday the light of our lives, our beloved dim sum developed a chesty kinda cold. Me and dad work together all week and she's now practically at 100%. Not us though. He's got snots coming out of his bloody ears and eyes, bad fever, the best example of cold/flu symptoms you can imagine. Meanwhile I've got the most annoying case of ""everything aches, yet no fever"", snots and congestion for days, brain fog to cover the whole island, I'm an absolute mess. But, I'm more functional than my husband, so guess who's been executive parent the last couple of days. 

Today, she resisted her nap. That was an hour and a half ago. We read all the books, she snuggled up in bed with all the stuffed animals she wanted, nasal spray to help her breathe through the last of her snots, cosy and comfy, yawning and sleepy. But as soon as I get up to get comfy in my own bed/sofa, with my now pretty cold coffee, she wiggles as though I'm trying to cheat her. Out pops her head from her sleep tent and I avoid looking at her. Probably because at that time I wanted solitude and silence to recharge and get ready for the afternoon, probably I was terrified she would jump out of bed and follow me around. I just want to be alone and survive the day. I leave her room while she's awake and I hope as passionately as a football fan for a goal, that she'll put herself to sleep like she used to. I was wrong. 

About 15 minutes after I go downstairs to finish my sorry coffee and mindlessly scroll about in silence, dad comes downstairs with the little one in tow. Tears started rolling down my cheeks and all I could think was ""why me? I'm so ill, I can't fucking cope without that break, why won't she feel my discomfort and comfort me by sleeping?"" Proper despairing thoughts. 

Husband gets dressed and drags his sorry corpse outside to run his errand, won't be back till her bedtime. We kiss him bye bye and she asks me what's wrong, so I explain that I'm tired and I need my quiet time. Since she didn't nap, I can't get my quiet time so she will have to play alone and quietly for a bit. She chews on that for a bit, starts protesting then stops. She climbs on the sofa next to me and proceeds to put herself to sleep, right next to me. She's still asleep and I'm still gobsmacked. 

Stuff like this really gets me wound up, like I didn't abduct her and force her to nap, what happened? What on earth am I supposed to learn from this? What will she take away from this? What on earth?! ",2,1730558713.0,toddlers,4,1.0,False

We met earlier this week and got coffee, then went around town and went to some places like a museum spontaneously. I had alot of fun, and felt quite giddy. We really vibed. Then we walked our dogs together today, and when we parted ways we hugged and he said I was cute.

I'm not sure if I *like him* like him -- he definitely likes me because he's asked about meeting for a third time to get lunch. I'm very emotionally constipated, and completely new to all of this.

Bono Fodell is frail and tired, a tragic ethos somewhere in his 30s who is on a devastating misadventure, seeking exemption from all sense and essence. A failed body and a treacherous psyche with a demented face, sharp nose, and dusky brown hair. He harbors excruciating, bodily discomfort and neverending ache of an incessant psychical conflict.  

Bono wakes up and starts panting for a morning ritual. This dreadful being has no notion of time, nor does he pay heed to the clocks. These machines, he very spitefully calls ‘troublesome tickers’, and yet he possesses about five of them to displease himself.  

Caffeine only adds up to his anxiety and there is nothing more, he longs for breakfast than a shot through the skull. He reaches out and fails to seize the cup, rather spills the coffee onto the table. Helplessly, looking at the fluid slowly seeping down into the cracked floor tile, from a dark to a darker abyss, he pours another. 

He spends his time in a chamber covered with black curtains and mosaic tiles, the other rooms have gradually become too bright to his gaze. Sometimes, he drags himself around the house and no further, to feel worn out and play dead until he feels anxious again. 

Around midday, Bono wants to be splattered on the ground, with his limbs and organs scattered all over, resulting from a fatally long decline. All he gets, however, is a piece of rotten bread, wrapped in spider web and water which one could easily mistake for urine. He quickly unties his neck from the rope he was so thrilled to tighten and hook the other end to a running freight train. Gaging and tearing up, he again splits his jaw broad open, forcing the bread into the mouth and down his throat.  

Bono Fodell fantasizes a spear through his heart, he yearns for the warm embrace of the last rest. His greatest fear, the idea, that this restlessness may not cease to persist, even after death. He spends his evening defending himself from rats which ever-so-often cleave a piece of flesh from his body if he dares fall asleep. The rest of the day is unremembered. 

Awakening from a brief blackout, he pulls a string, slightly elevating the blinds behind the curtain. Morning was, when the blinds came up, regardless of the absence of light. Coffee, poured pot to cup, on the surface, reflects a gloomy face, such is every day. The anguished soul does not know any better but lives by his lunacy. This noise-induced divergence between body and mind has forced upon a void like senselessness. Swayed by the spectre of a deceitful illusion called life, he no longer questions his means to carry the day. 

Bono breathes as he is, and has no other choice. He has long abandoned the notion that what he lives is a perpetual nightmare. For if it is a nightmare, it is the only reality there is.

Thank you!

1. Airport: Metro round trip is €16 and it's valid for 30 days, is this information correct? I found it online but seems it's rarely mentioned here. 

2. ATM: I'm using revolut. I will need some cash as was advised that Meteora is cash only. Is that all ATM in Athens would charge me extra fee?  

3. Travel Pass: I will be staying in Syntagma. Seems most of the sites are walking distance, would not be benefit from any travel pass (even for 5 day pass, I need to take 7 trips to cover the cost). Just wondering why it seems people would still use the transportation pass

4. Acropolis: Is 2 hours sufficient to see everything? I saw the recommended duration is 2 - 3 hours, but I also heard some people finished in 1.5 hours

5. Lycabettus Hill: Would there be some people walking up there or people just take the funicle? Asking because I kind of scared that there's no one around and I just walk alone there. 

6. Bar: I plan to visit a few bars (like Baba Au Rum) for cocktail/wine. Would it be weird if I go alone? 

7. Buy: Apivita (in their experience store), Greece Wine (can be just from supermarket), any other local products recommend?

Day 1 

Arriving airport at around 1pm

Ancient Agora and Roman Agora (if I got times)

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

Photo by LyfeFuel on Unsplash

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

#  [Click to Visit the Official Java Burn Website](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

1ghxuim,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikefit/comments/1ghxuim/help_me_make_decisions_about_my_stable/,Help me make decisions about my stable!,"Hi,

I've posted here before - this is a bit of an update, but also a request to help sort my thinking. 

Context: I had a very aggressive fit on my main drop bar bike, an Endpoint Coffee Grinder M/L and I was finding it increasingly uncomfortable after a period of aging and injuries. 

With help from /u/bikefitadvice and Jesse at MyVeloFit, I think I improved that fit through changing to smaller cranks and adjusting saddle height: [https://portal.myvelofit.com/shared/bebac1f2-21cc-479c-8d9a-e744115cce41](https://portal.myvelofit.com/shared/bebac1f2-21cc-479c-8d9a-e744115cce41)

  
However, the suggestion is still to raise my front end, which I'm at the limit of with the current fork. Jesse has suggested that if I were to get a new bike. I should shoot for ""the same or shorter reach, and at least 20mm more stack."" 

  
Now, prior to this adjustment, unfortunately, I purchased a road frame (a Fairlight Strael in 56R) based on that first, aggressive fit. Contrary to Jesse's conclusions above, it's longer and lower than the Endpoint and I fear I won't ever make it work for me (here it is with an 80mm stem, and still seems too long): [https://portal.myvelofit.com/shared/d0358937-1481-402d-91b9-c2b44ee71041](https://portal.myvelofit.com/shared/d0358937-1481-402d-91b9-c2b44ee71041)

  
So, currently am thinking: definitely sell the Fairlight as I don't think it will work, unfortunately, and either getting an uncut fork for the Endpoint or selling it as well and getting something more upright, like a Mason SLR, a Fairlight in the T size.

* *Standing tall at 6’0” (183cm) with a slim, athletic build. Think of me as a lean, mean trivia machine (more on that later).*
* *I’m an associate lawyer with a Law/Science degree, so I can help you win arguments—or at least tell you when you’re winning them.*
* *I’m passionate about a million things, so boredom is never an option.*

**What I’m into:**

* *Learning new things—I’ve even been on TV for a trivia show!*
* *Socialising and meeting new people. The more, the merrier (unless they’re the type who talks excessively during movies).*
* *Sports—whether it’s kicking a soccer ball around or hitting the tennis courts, I’m game.*
* *Adventures—hiking, museum hopping, or spontaneous road trips? Sign me up!*
* *Movies—action and comedy are my jam, but I’m open to suggestions.*
* *Creative stuff—like graphic design. Who knew being a lawyer could be so artsy?*
* *Staying fit—I work out regularly because, hey, someone’s got to keep the doctors out of business.*

**What I’m looking for:**

* *A kind and compassionate woman who’s driven, takes care of herself, and shares a non-religious outlook on life.*
* *Someone who can laugh at my bad jokes, indulge in deep conversations, and isn’t afraid to dream big.*
* *And hey, nothing personal at all, but I'm only really into Caucasians/Hispanics/Latinos*

Tips?,"My clusters start as an aura of generally 'not feeling well' which usually leads me to lay down, take a shower and/or call out of work. The next moment I can remember is always like 24 hours later after 3-4 TC seizures followed by a prolonged focal seizure. Midazolam nose spray doesn't do much so my wife always ends up calling the ambulance, 3/4th of the time they take me with them to the EMU to get me out of focal status epilepticus with midazolam IV. 

The first week post-seizure I'm completely useless and after that I'm looking at weeks of mental and physical recovery. I'm thankful my seizures are infrequent (once every 3-6 months) but damn. My first 15 years with epilepsy were nowhere near this bad.

I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Have any of you found any tips to prevent the clustering when faced with an aura, improve recovery speed or perhaps something else?

After a terrible year I'm pretty serious about this so I'm a saint when it comes to taking medication on time. Looking at quitting coffee and improving diet/exercise, also in therapy for 'coping with the disease' assuming it's here to stay.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

Am I being manipulated?,"For some context, we live together and have multiple pets (2 cats, 1 dog, 1 bunny) The bunny spends most of the time in one room and often pops his head out wanting to come out and socialize with the rest of us.

Last night I went to the gym after work and my gf stayed home with period pains and offered to get Pizza for us. I came back home, showered, we had pizza and it was all good until we proceeded to watch TV and I grabbed the bunny and brought him to the living room.

The couch usually has a blanket for the dog to lay on and I sat on it hugging the bunny. My gf immediately chnaged her body language and looked mad so I replied, do you not want him here? I feel bad because they all get to hand out with us and he gets treated like a second class citizen in the house. She tells me "" He was out in the yard today so he's dirty"" I say okay and grab him off my neck/chest where I was holding him to put him on the floor but he got nervous and jumped into the blanket.

Immediatly she yells at me at the top of her lungs extremely angry  in succesion "" get him off my blanket! Get him of my blanket!""

  
I sit there in shock (Mind you right before eating I told her I was having heart pains and was anxious, I have also told her several times screaming makes me anxious and I always ask her not to yell)

  
So I get up, put the bunny in the room and tell her Im going to sleep.

  
She gets angry and starts cleaning stuff and I can hear her fuming saying she shouldnt be cleaning by herself and she bought us pizza and starts riling herself up.

  
She then comes into the room extremely angry telling me she did nothing wrong! she bought us pizza and she was pissed and goes on and on and on as I sit there quiatly listening. All I say is "" He jumped and I garbbed him quick, I didnt put him on the blanket on purpose"" She continues raising her voice and cursing. Again, I stay quite. She says "" arent you going to say anything? I say, ""Okay can I speak?"" she immediately closes the room door and leaves. I stay and try to sleep again.

  
She comes back fuming again, cursing and raising her voice, I get up to talk and she immediately shuts the door and leaves. I go to sleep. 

I wake upe arly this morning, feed the animals and make coffee and sit waiting for her to wake up to speak. She gets up and goes ot the kitchen. I say Good morning and she ignores me and saying nothing back. 

  
This is where we are now.

  
She says she did nothing worng. I think she was disrespectful and her reacting was extremely disproportionate and I deserve and apology for being yelled at. I think yelling like that is something a 5 year old does and not a 28 year old. I do not tolarate being yelled at that way and I feel I did the right thing by removing myself from the situation and not engaging in an argument or yelling/curisng at her which is something I always avoid at all costs. 

I love her and shes otherwise a great human being but again, I just dont tolerate being yelled at like that. My mom never yelled like that, we always spoke and I dont want to be in a relationship where we yell like that at eachother. I believe people need to cool down and speak later but yelling should  ahve never happened in the first place.

  
Issue now is shes acting like the victim and giving me the silent tretament after saying she did nothing wrong.

6 am: black coffee, water

7 am – 1 pm: green tea with splash of lemon, black coffee

1 pm: bone broth

3 pm: bone broth

5-9 pm: food

 

It would make my fasting window 16 hours (no calories from 9 pm to 1 pm the next day), and my eating window would be 8 hours, but instead of lunch I would consume bone broth. The brand I use is a water-soluble powder with 65 kcal per 1 tbsp. If I drink two tbsp in the afternoon, that would be 130 kcal.

I’ve tried normal 16:8 for some time, but have not really seen the results I’m after (weight loss and slimmer looking legs). Possibly because I tend to “overcompensate” by eating more during my eating window. I also hate going to bed hungry, so if I can’t sleep because of hunger, I will make a sandwich. Going strict OMAD tends to make me really low energy (which is a given) and also really hangry. I’ve also heard that bone broth is protective of the gut microbiome, and that for some people warm bone broth makes them feel fuller. So I’m thinking of doing it this way, but would like some input on the matter. Perhaps I will still get brain fog and be hangry? Or will it get easier over time? Thanks!

  
Edited to add: I'm thinking of adding a morning walk to this equation, 55 mins during my fasting window. Should I maybe put that close to when I consume the broth, in order to reap the benefits of protein for muscle?",1,1730557890.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.6,False

Got into BJJ and go 4-5 times a week to train. It felt great. I had been smoking for over 20 years up to that point.

Two weeks ago, my wife informed me that our marriage is ending. I kind of saw it coming but it still hurt nonetheless. We've been together over 10 years, married for 6, own a home together, all the good things a couple should do. We just grew apart with changes in career and our kids (we each have a kid from a previous partner and her kid has moved out.)

She went away for the weekend to see a friend of hers back in her hometown so I bought a pack. I've been mostly alone in the house. I just had another one with my coffee this morning and felt disgusted so I threw the rest of the pack away. I have to stay strong for my health and for my 11 y/o son.

I'm not here to get sympathy or anything like that. I just wanted to post to get some thoughts out as I've lurked this community for so long and appreciate hearing stories of others' struggles and realize we're not perfect. So thank you, everyone.

Also, given the way she's been using these mashups of old songs to tell new stories, this analysis is limited to the lyrics she sang last night, not the parts of the songs she chose *not* to include. 

  
The Albatross/Holy Ground/Cold as You/exile

>Wise men once said  
""Wild winds are death to the candle""  
A rose by any other name is a scandal

\--> industry/family/church/whoever told her ""your wild winds (aka queerness) are going to extinguish the flame of your burgeoning career; queerness = scandal.""

>Cautions issue, he stood shooting the messengers  
As they tried to warn him about her

\--> there were signs of queerness, but Wine Moms preferred to shoot the messengers rather than see them

>Cross your thoughtless heart  
Only liquor anoints you  
She's the albatross  
She is here to destroy you

\--> Wine moms can't or won't think about what's right in front of them, and Taylor/the Albatross is... here to destroy them/their view of her.

>I was reminiscing just the other day  
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away  
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time  
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme  
  
Took off faster than a green light go  
Yeah you skip the conversation cause you already know  
Left a note on the door with a joke we made  
And that was the first day

\--> Remembering how it felt at the very beginning, tumbling headlong into the thrill of it all, skipping the conversation about what she's going to have to hide or give up, before the dissonance hit, before the averted rhyme scheme of The Very First Night became too much to ignore

>And darling, it was good  
Never looking down  
And right there where we stood  
Was holy ground

\--> It was magic and special as long as we didn't look too closely at the shaky foundation of it all

>And when that sky rains fire on you  
And you're persona non grata  
I'll tell you how I've been there too  
And that none of it matters

\--> it's all destined to come crashing down, reputation ruined, but... none of it matters

>Tonight I'm gonna dance  
For all that we've been through  
But I don't wanna dance  
If I'm not dancing with you  
Tonight I'm gonna dance  
Like you were in this room  
But I don't wanna dance  
If I'm not dancing with you  
It was good  
Never looking down  
And right there where we stood  
Was holy ground

\--> the Wine Mom contingent has been such a huge part of what's brought her here; she wants to celebrate these fans and all they've been through together; can't imagine dancing without them-- it's all good as long as they *don't look down* at the shaky foundation. Because for all that, it is still special; it's BEEN special for 18 years-- holy ground.

>Crossed my thoughtless heart  
Spread my wings like a parachute  
I'm the albatross  
I swept in at the rescue  
The devil that you know  
Looks now more like an angel  
I'm the life you chose  
And all this terrible danger

\--> The wine moms didn't realize it but all along she-- the idol-- the albatross-- WAS the terrible danger... but maybe that's okay? Maybe they *chose* this terrible danger and they can see her as the devil or they can let her sweep in at the rescue.

>Tonight I'm gonna dance  
Like you were in this room  
But I don't wanna dance  
If I'm not dancing with you  
Tonight I'm gonna dance  
Like you were in this room  
But I don't wanna dance  
If I'm not dancing with you

\--> the internal conflict-- she doesn't want to lose them even though it's painful

>You have a way of coming easily to me  
And when you take you take the very best of me

\--> the wine moms sure do gravitate toward her, it was the path of least resistance, but when they take from her they take the most meaningful parts

>So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something'  
And you do what you want, 'cause I'm not what you wanted

\--> so she starts flagging aggressively; there's infighting, but people stick with their own interpretations of her that THEY prefer if SHE is not what they wanted

>Oh what a shame  
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day

\--> the wine moms who will reject her for her queerness/if she comes out-- what a needlessly sad ending to what started so promisingly

>Just walk away  
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say  
And now that I'm sittin' here thinking in through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you

\--> Telling the wine moms fine, she's done begging for their approval; in reality; the adoration of people who are going to reject the most true parts of herself is a the coldest place to be

>I can see you starin' honey  
Like he's just your understudy  
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me

\--> Especially poignant if you think of this as all the attention being on the ""him""-- the boyfriend-- the football of it all; as if they'd ever go to bat for HER when he's the one they're staring at

>Second , third, and hundredth chances  
Balancin' on breaking branches  
Those eyes add insult to injury

\-->She keeps trying again and again to please everyone-- and to give them hundreds of chances to SEE her--but the eyes are focused on him, on the understudy

>I think I've seen this film before  
And I didn't like the ending  
I'm not your problem anymore  
So who am I offending now?

\--> she's seen how this ends; the wine moms will leave her. Well, fuck 'em, it's over, and now there's no one left to offend.

>You were my crown  
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out  
I think I've seen this film before

\--> they were her kingdom, her glory, but she knows the story here-- once she's out (OUT) she's in exile

>You never did give a damn thing honey  
But I cried, cried for you  
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you  
Died for you   
  
\--  
  
So step right out  
There is no amount of crying  
I can do for you

\--> She is *killing* herself for them and they never did give a damn and it is never, never enough, no amount of dying or crying -- note that that sentiment segues right from Cold as You into exile

>All this time  
I've always walked a very thin line  
You didn't even hear me out  
You never gave a warning sign

\--> she has been trying to walk this very thin line of pleasing everyone, of not being too explicit, but dropping hints--but they didn't even hear her out

>All this time  
You never learned to read my mind  
Couldn't turn things around  
I gave so many signs  
So many signs  
So many signs  
You didn't even **read** the signs

\--> It's been so long, she's given so many signs, and they never learned to **read** any of them-- note that \*read\* is not the original lyric. (We all know who reads her lyrics, who Dear Reader is addressed to-- and who doesn't even \*read\* the signs)

>  
I think I've seen this film before  
And I didn't like the ending  
You're not my homeland anymore  
So who am I defending now  
You were my town  
Now I'm in exile seeing you out  
I think I've seen this film before  
So I'm leaving out the side door  
So step right out  
There is no amount of crying I can do for you  
All this time  
We always walked a very thin line  
You didn't even hear me out  
Cause you never gave a warning sign  
All this time  
You never learned to read my mind   
You didn't turn things around  
And I gave so many signs  
So many signs  
So many signs  
You didn't even **hear** the signs

\--> She's seen how this ends, no amount of crying or sign-giving has ever been enough for them to see, **read,** or **hear** her (I'm pretty sure it's anothe rlyric to change to didnt' even **hear** the signs, but not 100% sure about this.) 

>So oh what a shame  
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Every smile you fake is so condescending   
Counting all the scars you make  
Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you  
  
I think I've seen this film before  
I think I've seen this film before  
So I'm leaving out the side door

\--> in conclusion-- what a shame that her 18-year relationship with these fans is going to end this way-- but now that she's thinking about it, about all the scars the condescending wine mom smiles have left-- she's never been anywhere that cold, and so she's leaving out the side door.

  
To step right out.

1ghxjh9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ghxjh9,No pressure at shower head leading to a damaged brew temp sensor and a lot of questions,"Hello All,

Very much hoping for some help from the wonderful community here as none of the existing posts were able to 100% answer my question and I would like some feedback before buying parts and paying for shipping just to have to re-diagnose and pay again.

So, the story starts 6 months ago when I bought a used unit (No. 0105116463, dated 2004) from a very nice person who let me know that the unit has recently been serviced by a ""friend"" who was not a professional, but mechanically inclined. This is backed up by the fact that all the connections inside the machine are numbered. The unit also sported a filter that sat inside the water tank that the owner said was to filter out lime scale (very common problem in Belgium). Other than the wear marks, it seemed fine and brewed well with the notable exception that the portafilter would not lock 100% in place, it always remains at the 7 o'clock position instead of filling locking in.

After using the machine for several months with no issues, I noted that the flow of water through the puck started going slower and slower. Initially, I wrote this off as too fine of a grind, but recently the machine has been unable to produce enough pressure to even brew a single shot.

After researching, my only thought was that the filter material had migrated into the internals of the machine. After getting the boiler opened up, there was indeed what looked like some foreign material in the boiler, but not enought to cause the type of issues I was experiencing.

Upon reassembly, I accidentally broke one of the spades off of the coffee temp switch. I have a replacement on order, but looking through my disassembly photos, I noted that only one of the spades was even connected in the first place, so even when I reassemble it, I will only have one terminal to connect to the replacement sensor.

So, moving forward, the options seem to be:
- buy an OE replacement sensor, plug the one spade back in and hope the problem is solved
-same as above, but disassemble the whole loom and ensure all the connections are correct
- buy an M4 adapter and a replace the thermostat with a thermocouple as part of a PID build

My main goal is to have the unit running back at baseline performance as soon as possible, but if it makes sense to upgrade rather than replace I'm open to it.

I have provided as many pictures as possible and sincerely appreciate any feedback.

P.S. I see many different temp. values for the sensor, obviously different temps for the brew and steam switches, but is 104 or 107 preferred for the brew switch?

1ghxedt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/RdhTQ9t1fT,Not OP: AITAH for letting my kids loot my brother's house to prove my point. ,"Great petty confetti 🎊

My brother and his family came for a visit last month. My kids and I play with lego and we have fun leaving little dioramas around my house. Just silly stuff like a fight between Ironman and Darth Vader on the loot llama. It's just our way of leaving Easter eggs around the house. 

My nephew really liked them and decided to take a few home. When we noticed they were missing I asked my brother to bring them back. He said that it was just kids being kids and that he would them back the next time we saw each other. 

I saw him for coffee and I reminded him beforehand that I wanted all our stuff back. He ""forgot"" to bring the ""toys"". Okay. Game on. 

We went over to his place for a BBQ. I told my kids that unless all our stuff was returned to us when we got there literally anything in the house was fair game. Like the godless barbarians they are they went to town. When we left I don't think there were any remotes, small electronics, or beer mugs left at his house. I actually  had to sneak the dog back into the house before we left. 

I started getting calls on our way home. I ignored them. 

When I got home I returned his calls. He said a bunch of stuff was missing from his house. I said I would check with the kids. He said that I fucking well knew what happened and that he wanted his shit back. I said I would box it up and return it the next time we saw eack other. As long as we got our lego back. 

He was at my house with my Lego later that evening. He had even accidentally included stuff that wasn't ours. I returned it and his stuff. I told him that this is how we would be dealing with his kid in the future. 

He is pissed off that he had to make a special trip to return my stuff. My parents think that there is a huge difference between an eight year old taking Lego minifigures and a couple of teenagers pillaging their uncle's house.

Sorry for the long post and my English! First a Huge Thank you to everyone in this sub reddit for motivating me to consistently prepare over the past few months. I have around 5 years of overall experience.

Preparation time: 4-5 Months, I used to wonder how people were able to reffer so many resources in such a short time, but now I know this exam will make you refer every possible resource. Especially very less chances that you can skip official study guide unless you have strong cybersecurity experience.

Materials I used:

* Books: [DestCert book](https://destcert.com/cissp/guidebook-2024/), OSG
* Summaries/writeups: [Free isc2 cissp flashcards](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp/cissp-self-study-resources), [Free DestCert summaries](https://destcert.com/cissp-certification-guidance/),  [free cisspprep guides](https://cissprep.net/super-study-guide/), Thor's domain summary guides, Free [Prabh's coffee shots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CcyKOrlKgTdwVUR0lsGjww1uIrxKyr7C/pubhtml), Free Memory palace(only for 1 day), Reddit posts, other free youtube content.
* Practice exams: [Gwen Betty Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/109quI/), Thor's hard exams(only attempted 2 exams), DestCert app(attempted like 200Qs overall), Pocketprep one month subscription(1000 practice questions extremely helpful), LearnZapp one month subscription,[ Insider cloud free practice quiz](https://insidethemicrosoftcloud.com/cissp-practice-quiz/), Quantum exams (a game changer—not compulsory, but helpful for simulating the exam environment; I used it only in the last few days, but the ""answer the question"" mindset really helped in the actual exam).

My Journey:

I have decided to write cissp in Decemeber 2023 and targeted to attempt the exam in september 2024 as I want to give myself enough time for preparation as people told me that this is one of the toughest exam. However, I have not started serious preparation until June/July 2024 as I was focusing on mobile pentest certs, procrastination and other personal works. IMO, **Don't spend more than 6 months on this certification.**

* **June**:  I started with **OSG** and I am not habituated to read books so it did not work for me, I only read 2 chapters on my first try. So, I switched to **Pete Zerger exam cram on youtube** \- It is a great must watch free resource, but it was too much information for me to consume (IMO, use this resource towards the end unless you have strong cybersec experience)
* **July**: I Switched to **Thors Udemy courses**(company provided) Although it is a great resource, I was not able to focus, did not work for me as I got bored too easily. So again I switched to **Linkedin Mike chappel** course, entire July I have spent on this & the 1-3min videos are very good and easy to consume, finally I am able to **digest cissp lengthy material**.
* **August**: After finishing mike chappel course I wrote **Gwen Bettwy practice tests** on udemy. They are good and I only used to score 50-65% & I thought I am not ready to take the exam in Sept and also I learned about CISSP peace of mind voucher so I bought the voucher by cancelling the current exam and scheduled my first attempt on Oct 31. Also referred to some excellent youtube content like **Prabh's,** [**Gwen betty test taking tips**](https://youtu.be/dih4cLy6G_E?si=UVHK0pXbsAWp_Jfl)**, TIA 50Q's etc.**
* **September**: There is a lot of hype for DestCert, so I bought **destcert concise guide in amazon kindle** and started reading it, I was able to read the entire book so easily. I used to read it during commute, layovers, etc. One of the best investment. simultaneously, I took **pocketprep** subscription from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/capm/comments/1384wb8/20_off_pocket_prep_premium/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is a very good resource to identify your weak areas and take notes.
* **October**: Bought **Learnzapp** and I have started giving practice exams and noting down weak topics for which I made my own notes in notion app and sometimes asked **chatgpt** to summarize a topic and give me one liners. I almost took 1600 Q's with 70% readiness score (you get repeated question most of the times even when you select unanswered option)
* **Mid October**: while reviewing weak areas from OSG, I realised that OSG is not really that dry and thought of reading it. This time to my surprise I was able to finish a chapter in 1-2 hours. I used to see a sub heading and ask myself if I know this topic, if yes, I would skip it and move on. Finished reading OSG and made notes on the **exam essentials and unknown topics.**
* **Last few days of October & Quantum Exam**: There is so much hype for **quantum exams** and decided to buy them. Although it is bit costly I wanted to pass this cert on my first try. So I took 3-4 exams in exam mode and 2 in practice mode if I remember correct. This exactly matches with real exam environment. I have to admit that the questions are hard in Quantum Exams and with Quantum I understood how ""answer the question"" helps.
* **2 Days before the exam**: Rewatched Pete Zerger video, Prabhs coffe shots, memory palace, Reviewed DestCert summaries, OSG exam essentials, reviewed my own weak topics notes, etc

**Exam Experience:**

Its more like mix of technical and managerial questions. Although I had to travel 180kms and has only 5-6 hours of sleep in a hotel, I was somehow completely focused during the exam. Some were direct questions, some were scenario based question, I was able to identify 3-4 un-scored questions as they had terminology that I did not see during preparation. If you are well prepared you can straight away eliminate 2 options easily, you only have to choose between 2 options in almost all questions. In the first 1 hour I was able to complete 38 questions and thought I was already late and could not finish 150 questons so I ignored the time and kept answering the questions until I was comfortable with the option I picked.  I particularly remember a feeling that I got at 70th question, I just wanted finish exam and leave the testing center irrespective of result. At question number 99 I saw 38min left and I spent 2min on 100th question and the exam finished. It was such a relief.

**If I have to do it again**:

I would first go through a video content like LinkedIn Mike chappel course -> Watch all DestCert mindmaps to understand interconnectivity -> Read OSG -> LearnZapp or pocketprep or Gwen betty exams or Quantum exams -> exam crams in youtube -> Write Exam & Pass

**Conclusion:** Do your Due Deligence before attempting this certification, because once you start preparation and by the time your self doubt kicks in, you’ll have already invested too much time to turn back. IMO, Do this certification if your work/job requires it.

That's it. Thank you and All the best to everyone and I hope this post helps motivate someone!
