1p242e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CADAI/comments/1p242e2/when_automation_saves_the_day_real_case_from_an/,When Automation Saves the Day — Real Case from an Aerospace Project,"A few years back I was working on an aerospace job that felt like it aged me a decade in a single month. You know the kind of project I mean. Tight deadlines. Moving targets. A stack of drawings on your desk that only seems to get taller no matter how many you finish. One afternoon I watched a junior engineer fight with sheet after sheet of repetitive geometry. Same views. Same notes. Same tolerance blocks. After the third coffee he looked at me like he was physically melting. I knew that look. We have all been there.

This is where automation quietly becomes the hero of the story. Not the sci fi type with blinking lights. Just simple rule based tools that take the grunt work and give you back some brainpower for the real problems.

On that project we had hundreds of similar components. Variants of housings and brackets that shared the same basic structure. If you did everything by hand you were signing up for days of copy paste misery. I had seen this play out enough times in my career to know better. So I sat down with the team and walked them through a small workflow trick I had learned about fifteen years earlier. Set up a template once. Capture the repeatable parts. Link the properties. Let the system build the views and notes for you so you only touch the unique bits.

What would normally take half an afternoon per drawing suddenly turned into fifteen minutes of tweaking. And here is the interesting part. The quality went up. Fewer typos. Fewer mismatched tolerances. No forgotten callouts hiding in the corner like landmines waiting for a manufacturing engineer to spot them weeks later. The junior engineer who had been melting earlier looked at the automated output and said something like: So this is what it feels like to win.

The lesson that stuck with me is simple. Automation is not about replacing engineers. It is about removing the pointless grind that drains your patience and hides your mistakes. Every time I have used it well the team has ended up with more energy for the tough calls the kind that actually matter. And the bonus is that it usually prevents late night fire drills.

Curious what others here think. Where has automation quietly saved your project or maybe even your sanity?",1,1763647650.0,CADAI,0,1.0,False

I was seeing someone in a more casual dynamic in the last few months. To give some context I am 26 year old female and he is 54. We have been going out to coffee dates and have been intimate. I have been trying to move states so I know this current relationship is not something we have agreed to make extremely serious.  I have asked questions about his previous relationships and other things. He gets really defensive and angry when I ask anything. I have heard from him he has this female friend who he babysits her child and he has admitted to helping her buy a car. I have noticed he has been a lot less engaged with texting and our dates are much shorter. I also have noticed he has been extremely mad when I ask if he is seeing anyone else. I have communicated that it is ok to see others as long as we use protection and the person is tested etc. I honestly do not mind if it's another causal dynamic as long as they are being safe sexually. I feel concerned I'm in a home wrecking situation. I feel like he maybe in a serious relationship or engaged or something. Am I being paranoid or do you sense that I could be onto something. I feel like it is crazy to hook up with someone who gets so angry when you are just making sure you are all being safe. ",2,1763647438.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p23t18,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1p23t18/first_time_taking_the_gre_what_helped_and_what/,"First time taking the GRE, what helped and what went wrong (Neurodivergent edition) 165Q 163V- Thank you Greg and Vince","Hello! I took the GRE a couple days ago and scored an unofficial 165Q and 163V, I'm decently happy with the score, considering it was my first run at doing the whole test at once (would not advise), but I do plan on taking it again.

I put a TLDR at the bottom of each section if you don't want to read all this lol.,

I know there are plenty of ""I just took the GRE"" posts, but I wanted to make one for people who need accommodations since things look a little different. For reference, I received time and a half for ADHD and bipolar disorder. I also work 50 hours a week at a very stressful job at a big software/hardware company, and work was at peak chaos.

Some academic background: I am two years post-undergraduate degree. I majored in statistics, but was full blown manic and unmedicated for bipolar most of my undergrad, so I really do not remember much math and felt quite rusty. I am applying to graduate school for biostatistics so I really focused my energy on quant.

# Studying: 

I used Gregmat. Not sponsored, I swear (unless you're offering Greg). Just where else do you get that level of resources for under 10 bucks, I mean, come on. For quant, I did most all of the foundation videos of the two month plan. I switched to Prepswift for certain topics I already knew well, and for strategies. I mostly did quant at first since that was my main concern, then verbal. I attended a few live classes, and tbh would really recommend it for my fellow ADHDers. The ability to interact with a teacher and other students made it easier to focus, and I could ask questions on the fly. I watched the pre-recorded videos in 2x speed, which I would also recommend for those of us attentionally-challenged. In addition to the flashcards on Gregmat, I made my own for any helpful tricks that were mentioned in the videos and tougher problems I did not get correct. 

For verbal, I used the one-month plan videos for TC, then sort of came to a halt due to the fact I injured my back pretty bad. Ended up having to get surgery just 10 days before the test date, also would not recommend. I definitely procrastinated on vocab, and overestimated my pre-existing vocabulary. I ended up using Vince's GRE Vocab cartoons app instead of the Vocab Mountain in Gregmat. The mnemonics and pictures in the app really helped me remember the vocab better. I also wrote flashcards since it is practically necessary for me to write things out in order to remember them.

My bipolar depression is usually much worse this time of year, so I ended up spending way too much money at my local coffee shop, using the food there as motivation to study. But hey, it worked! I'd still probably recommend it for people who struggle to get out of bed sometimes, let alone sit down and study. I also started to wake up very early to study rather than after work. Both my bipolar depression and ADHD are less intense in the early morning, and my brain feels like mush after work.

I didn't spend too much time on the essay- just watched the Prepswift videos for the types of prompts and the outline template. The programs I am applying to really don't care about it, and I am usually very good at essay writing.

I did not at any point fully take an entire practice exam at once which was a big mistake. I also did not do much timed practice. DO NOT DO WHAT I DID. I just could not find the energy and focus to do so with all that I had going on at the time, which isn't an excuse; I'm just being honest.  


**TLDR:** 

**What went right:** 

\- Gregmat, particularly foundation videos at 2x speed

\- Vince's Vocab app

\- Handwriting flashcards

\- Studying before work

  
**What went wrong:**

\- not doing timed practice or full practice exam

\- overestimating my vocab knowledge

\- getting back surgery

\- originally trying to study after work  


# Test day:

I was originally planning on taking the test at home- since the idea of driving to the testing center and then sitting for 3 hours did not bode well with back surgery. After reading some at-home horror stories I decided last minute to take it at a testing center, I think I am glad I did. I could not afford for my test scores to be cancelled for some stupid reason at home. 

Checking in was easy. They had small lockers for me to put my purse in which was great; they even let me go out to get Advil from it when I started getting a migraine halfway through. They had me empty my pockets, show my wrists and ankles, and waved a metal detector around. Very non-invasive, which I appreciated.

Upon starting the test, the screen said I had the standard 1 hr 58 minutes time. I went back out to the lobby to ask if my accommodations were there, since I was expecting time and a half. They were, but for some reason, that intro screen didn't change. Once I clicked past it, the time was correctly reflecting my accommodations.

I recently started concerta (like two days prior), and I think it is what gave me a migraine halfway through. The screen became hard to read at one point, and words kept dancing around. I lowkey felt like it was a lost cause at that point and just wanted to get it done. I'm pretty sure I received the harder second sections for both quant and verbal.

I was grateful to be done, but was absolutely petrified to look at my score. However, since reporting your scores after test day cost an additional fee I forced myself to look. I was pleasantly surprised considering the migraine, but it definitely wasn't quite my goal. If I am able to rake up enough cash to take it again for the couple of universities that have a later deadline, I think I will.

  
**TLDR:**

**What went right:**

\- Taking it at a testing center

\- Having Advil

  
**What went wrong:**

\- starting a new medication just before the exam

\- back surgery

  
That's all folks. Thank you- Greg and Vince!

1p23rdr,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/san-diego-teachers-ice-patrols,Inside the dawn patrols where San Diego teachers track ICE: ‘We have to resist’,"With students terrified and arrests rising, educators turn activists – scanning streets, sharing alerts and defending the right to feel safe

Three teachers drove through a quiet neighborhood in southern San Diego, the sun not yet fully up over the horizon. They drank coffee and talked about their jobs. The start of the school day was still an hour or two away.

Suddenly, mid-conversation, they spotted something: what appeared to be an undercover Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, driving right past them.

To an untrained eye, the unmarked SUV didn’t look out of place among the dozens of other cars lining the residential street. But the educators saw what many might miss: the completely tinted windows of the unmarked Dodge Durango (a popular choice for law enforcement), the small strip of lights near the front of the car, the steel prisoner partition faintly visible inside (dividing the front seat from the back). Sure enough, the SUV’s driver picked up a handheld radio.

Watching this, high school teacher Marysol Duran clicked her own walkie talkie to life.

“We have identified a potential,” she reported to others in her unit, following closely behind. “He is on 39th and Gamma. We will keep close watch.”

Duran, and other members of her organization, are not just teachers. They’re also members of the Association of Raza Educators, a group of activists that regularly patrols southern California streets to keep an eye out for ICE. When they spot undercover agents, who may be in the area conducting surveillance or actively planning to arrest or detain someone, they alert the surrounding community: via social media, group chats – and sometimes a giant megaphone.

The fall morning they spotted the Dodge Durango, the teachers were patrolling a several-mile radius near half a dozen local schools. That choice of location was intentional. Only two months earlier, at least four parents were arrested or detained by immigration officials near schools in San Diego county alone. Outside one Chula Vista elementary school, an undocumented mother, who had allegedly overstayed her visa, was arrested during morning drop-offs as her children watched from the car.

ICE’s San Diego field office did not respond to several requests for comment regarding the suspected undercover vehicle or any other San Diego arrests near school sites.

In the US, children have the right to a free public education from kindergarten to 12th grade, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Although immigration officers were previously limited in their ability to make arrests in or near “sensitive locations”, like schools and churches, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded those Obama and Biden-era guidelines earlier this year. School districts like San Diego unified have passed resolutions that require ICE agents to obtain a warrant before entering school property, but that has not stopped a spate of arrests from happening just off school grounds.

So when the three teachers noticed the potential ICE agent in October, they turned their car around and followed. The Dodge parked and the teachers did, too. Juan Orozco, a high school counselor, watched from the driver’s seat. Duran sat next to him, and Aremi Lopez, an elementary school teacher, clutched a megaphone in the backseat.

After a few minutes, the Dodge sped away without warning. The teachers drove after it.

“Buenos días, compañeros,” Duran reported in a series of live social media updates. “Estamos en la comunidad de Shelltown. Estamos aquí reportando, parte de la Association de Raza Educadores y Unión del Barrio, y tenemos movimiento: un Dodge Durango. Gris.”

She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego. We have identified a Dodge Durango, grey, that has been surveilling our community.”

Fear among students and parents across southern California is at an all-time high, particularly after the supreme court ruled earlier this fall that federal agents can stop and detain residents in Los Angeles simply for speaking Spanish, appearing Latino or working certain types of jobs. Now, there have been instances where students don’t come to school because they, or their parents, are scared to leave the house, Orozco said.

“We live in a state of fear, [whether you’re a] citizen or not a citizen: plumber, professional, mother, grandma, everyone,” he said. “And we shouldn’t live like that.”

But teachers, and a handful of their students, are also quietly and consistently mobilizing in big and small ways: by hosting morning patrols near local schools, organizing know-your-rights seminars, and keeping each other informed about the presence of ICE.

“We said, ‘Hell no, we have to resist,’” Orozco said. “We have to stand for dignity and protect this safe place for us: schools.”

‘They’re coming after all of us’

In the small library of a nearby San Diego high school, 14-year-old Azda* sat across from her sister, 19-year-old Guadalupe*. Behind them, many of the books on the shelves and posters on the wall had activist themes; an illustration of Che Guevara peeked out from the top shelf. In the hallway outside the library, a hand-painted banner read “education not deportation”.

The school is located only a few miles from where the teachers spotted the suspected undercover ICE vehicle just a week before.

And while Azda just started her freshman year of high school there, and Guadalupe her second year of college nearby, the sisters often have more on their minds than other teenagers might.

Because of where they were born, Azda is a citizen, but Guadalupe is undocumented. They’ve always worried that one day ICE may pick up their mother, who is also undocumented.

“I do fear for her,” Guadalupe said of her mother. “But not only just when she’s dropping off her kids at school, it’s every second of the day.”

Growing up, their family had a specific action plan in case of emergency, like other parents in California might prepare for earthquakes or wildfires. But instead, Azda and Guadalupe’s mother prepared them for ICE. If she was deported, their mother told them, they would need to immediately seek help from their aunt, or close friends who lived nearby. Then, to avoid breaking up the family, all of them would need to “flee together” back to Mexico.

Azda and Guadalupe have tried to explain this looming specter of ICE and deportation to their younger siblings, in ways they might be able to understand. When it comes to their little brother, who is four years old, they’ve chosen their words carefully.

“We have to simplify these big concepts to him,” Guadalupe said. “We just say, like, ‘Okay, la migra, they do bad things. They take families – se llevan a las mamás [they take mothers].’”

The language of ICE protests has even worked its way into the four-year-old’s budding vocabulary. He’ll sometimes walk around the house, they said, chanting: “La chota, la migra. ¿La migra, la misma porquería!?” [Or: “Immigration, police, the same garbage.”]

This year, as ICE agents have circled San Diego neighborhoods, businesses and school zones, Azda and Guadalupe have felt perpetually on edge. Everywhere they go, whether to school, or the grocery store, or to hang out with friends, they’ve learned to scan for signs of undercover ICE vehicles: Are those overly tinted windows? Does that SUV have a different kind of license plate?

That sense of unease follows Azda when she goes home, too. As she scrolls through Instagram, reels of dancing and cooking videos bleed into shaky footage of people from around the country being dragged away by ICE. Often, their spouses or children stand off to the side, screaming and crying. But recently, after seeing one of those videos, Azda got angry. She put down her phone and wrote a poem, titled La Migra.

“Todo lo que te digan es una mentira. ¿No saben que esta es nuestra tierra también?” [Or: “Everything they tell you is a lie. Don’t they know this is our land too?”]

Azda’s high school, which is uniquely involved in anti-ICE activism and patrolling, has encouraged her burgeoning sense of advocacy. A majority of the school’s students, if not all, are undocumented themselves or come from mixed-status families, according to staff members there. Azda has attended meetings about how to patrol around her school for ICE, and has walked around her own neighborhood with her aunt to look for “suspicious cars or suspicious people”.

She also recognizes that because she’s a US citizen, unlike her sister and mother, she has an added layer of security when it comes to protesting or being outspoken about immigration issues.

“I don’t feel like I have to do this, I feel like I want to be the one to do it,” Azda said. “Because if I’m not, then who is?”

Guadalupe attends monthly Association of Raza Educators meetings, but thinks her school in particular – San Diego City College – could do more than just hosting a few know-your-rights sessions.

“It’s something that we have to keep actively engaging with. It can’t just be a one-time workshop,” she said. “You can’t just do things by yourself. If something happens to you, you need to have this group of people backing you up.”

As a kid, Guadalupe sometimes felt a gulf between her and her siblings when it came to their differing legal statuses. Now, though, it feels as if they’re all under threat.

“La migra [immigration] and the state are attacking anyone that’s brown. They’re attacking anyone, even US citizens,” she said. “So I don’t feel that division no more. It’s like they’re coming after all of us.”

‘The right to an education’

The three educators on the early-morning ICE patrol agreed: students across different age groups, from high schoolers to younger elementary school students, have had similar responses to the immigration crackdown. Fear, they said, is an equalizing force.

“They’re all stressed, scared,” Orozco remarked from the driver’s seat, before they spotted the undercover ICE vehicle. “They don’t know what this means.”

San Diego has seen far more immigration arrests in 2025 than in years past; three times as many people were arrested by ICE in just the first half of this year compared to all of 2024, NBC reported. More than 50% of the 2025 arrests involved people with no criminal convictions.

But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added. Unión del Barrio, the southern California-based political organization that founded the Association of Raza Educators, first started conducting community patrols to scan for law enforcement more than three decades ago. And the recent supreme court ruling merely formalized the racial profiling that’s been happening behind the scenes for years, he said.

When he was 12 years old, in the early 1980s, Orozco remembers waiting at a bus stop in downtown San Diego. An unmarked white van – with the telltale metal prisoner partition inside – pulled up unexpectedly in front of him. What he believed to be immigration agents got out and threw Orozco, who is an American citizen, in the back.

“And I started kicking and screaming, kicking and screaming,” he said. “Then they pulled off to the side and the two officers said: ‘Say the Pledge of Allegiance.’ I started saying it and they let me go.”

Orozco walked shakily back to the bus. Bystanders were shocked. “It looked like a kidnapping,” he said.

On a policy level, there is some hope on the horizon: in late October, the San Diego city council voted to move forward with an ordinance that, once passed, would require federal law enforcement to have a warrant to access any non-public area within city facilities, including places like recreation centers and libraries. The city’s ordinance does not apply to schools, which are already covered under the school district’s previous resolution.

But the “terrifying” reality, said San Diego councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera, who authored the new ordinance, is that areas like streets and sidewalks just outside of schools are considered public spaces, and “the ability to legislate federal action” in those locations is “just incredibly, incredibly limited”.

“If I could pass a policy that made every school, every street, off limits, I would do everything I could to do that,” he said.

As for the outcome of the teacher ICE patrol in October, the three educators eventually lost track of the undercover vehicle they were following. At an intersection, Duran and Orozco looked left to right, and examined the parked cars in driveways for signs of recent movement. But the Dodge was gone.

As the teachers ended their morning patrol and headed back to their original meeting point, the neighborhood began to fill with families. Parents walked hand-in-hand with their children to an elementary school nearby.

“You see the beauty of our community,” Duran said, watching the scene unfold from the passenger seat. “Just doing what any other human being would do in the United States: taking their children to school because they have the right to a free education.”

With the patrol over, Duran, Orozco and the other educators and volunteers quickly packed up their gear: their mounted car cameras, their walkie talkies, their megaphones.

It was 7am, and they needed to make their way to their real jobs – the school day was starting soon.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’m Darya, I’m from Moldova (yes, it’s a real country 😁), and I decided to start writing a little diary here because I have way too many thoughts stuck in my head.

Today I want to talk about someone very special — my daughter’s teacher. Her name is Xenia. She’s only 21, but honestly, she was born for this job. She’s smart, kind, patient, and the kids absolutely adore her.

In Moldova we speak two languages — Russian and Romanian — and it’s surprisingly hard to find a qualified teacher who speaks Russian. Xenia does. She’s not even from Chișinău, the capital, but somehow we were lucky enough to get her.

My daughter loves her so much. Every morning she asks, “Is Xenia there today?” (our kindergarten has a shift system — one teacher in the morning, another in the evening). And all the kids literally run inside when they see her at the door.

Everything would be perfect… except for one thing: her salary. She earns around $300 a month. Three hundred. It’s insane. You can’t live on that here — not with our prices. A coffee costs $2, a simple dress $20, renting a tiny one-bedroom apartment costs about $200 before utilities. It’s impossible.

So Xenia is leaving. She’s going abroad to find a better life, and honestly, she deserves it. She’s talented, beautiful, smart — she shouldn’t be struggling like this.

But when I found out she was leaving, I cried.
My husband and I talked about this possibility before, but we hoped it wouldn’t happen so soon. I was just… so happy that this amazing person was the one teaching my daughter. And now she’s leaving, and I feel so sad and helpless about it.

What really breaks my heart is that this isn’t just her story — it’s Moldova’s story. Salaries are so low that soon there will be no teachers, no doctors, no young specialists left. Those are the foundations of society. And they’re falling apart.

I truly wish Xenia all the happiness she didn’t get here. Parents appreciated her. The state didn’t.

Thanks for reading. I just needed to get this off my chest.

I got married couple of years ago. We had short engagement and a small wedding. I basically organized the whole wedding for less than two months without any help from my family or friends except from my now husband. To be honest I was okay with the idea of just eloping but my husband insisted that our family and friends should be part of the ceremony. We tried to keep our guests list as tight as possible. So from my side I invited immediate family and only 5 close friends, which I knew from years. However, 1 of those friends was my brother’s ex (34F) lets call her Sharon. 

My brother (37M) lets call him Dave and Sharon separated 5 years before my wedding. He met a new girl (37 F) lets call her Nancy, they got married and had a beautiful baby boy, who was 3 at the time of my wedding. Indeed Dave was the one who introduced me to Sharon, but it turned out that we worked in the same place at the time and we did bond pretty fast. After Dave and Sharon broke up (by the way it was very civilized brake up at least from what I’ve witnessed) Sharon and I kept our friendship going. We went out together, traveled together and I didn’t kept that a secret from Dave or my family. No one did raise any objections. 

When Dave introduced Nancy to the family we welcomed her, we talked a lot over the phone, whenever I was visiting they insisted I stayed at their home (although my parents leave next door) when my nephew was born I was trying to help them whenever possible. Nancy was also aware of my friendship with Sharon but again no concerns whatsoever have been mentioned ever. 

So the wedding came, the day went smoothly no drama. Until a few weeks after the wedding. My father informed me that Dave and Nancy were upset with me for inviting Sharon to the wedding. Up until this moment I honestly didn’t think that this would be a big of an issue. Obviously, I didn’t think they will all become best friends, but since Dave and Sharon had separated quite some time before Dave met Nancy and nighter Sharon nor Dave have made any attempts to get back together, I thought this was baried somewhere in the past and it was ancient history. 
As we were all going to a trip together I used the opportunity to speak to Dave and Nancy and apologized to both if I have caused them any discomfort and I explained that this was not my intention and Sharon was invited to the wedding in her capacity as my friend nothing more. They both excepted my apology and told me everything was fine. 

However, throughout the past 2 years they have been avoiding my husband and me. Whenever we are visiting my parents at my home town, which is 2-3 time per year they refuse to come to dinner, they usually invite us for coffee at their place after the dinner so I can see my nephew but that’s all. Couple of times they even left the city last minute. Whenever they come to the town where I live they don’t call. They even stopped coming to family reunions.

During the evening, my ex-boss called his father (\~80M), and we all spoke to him on speakerphone. Everything seemed totally normal.  
  
His father mentioned that he was planning to visit the city where my ex-boss and I currently live, and suggested the three of us meet up for coffee.  


To tease my ex-boss, I said that knowing him, this meetup might never happen. So I trust the father, and if his son doesn't have time or desire and cancels everything like he often does, I would still be delighted to see the father. That was literally it.  
  
Some context:  
  
My ex-boss is not someone to trust. He never keeps his word. He let me down more than ones. He was disrespectful to me many times and did a lot of gaslighting (which I only recognized years later thanks to our Potato Queen Charlotte, who I absolutely love). I keep minimal contact with him, maybe once a year, because I don’t want to be manipulated again.

I have nothing against his father though. He calls me rarely, but still more often than his son does. He and his wife (his second wife, not my ex-boss's mother) even hosted me for several days during ex-boss birthday festivities, etc. Everything always went well with the father and his family.

I’ve also met the father alone several times in the past: in the previous city we lived in, and even once in my ex-boss’s house when the boss was late and we were supposed to work on a presentation. Nothing weird ever happened.  
  
Back to last night. After that part of the discussion I already mentionned, we all talked a little more with the father, and finally he said that he would come to our city and the three of us would meet up. I said again, jokingly (!!), that if his son don't respect his promice, the father had my number to meet for a coffee as the last time I saw him was 5 years ago (I thought the old man will be pleased to know that someone wants to see him again).  
  
Then we said goodbye and that was it. The evening continued.  
  
  
This morning, I received the following text from the father’s wife who was listening to last night conversation:  
  
  
*Hello \[my name\],*  
  
*I was shocked by your attitude towards \[father's name\] last night, and your repeated insistence on meeting him alone in \[city\]. What do you expect from him? I expect a frank and straightforward answer. Thank you.*  
  
  
I was absolutely stunned.  
  
Am I reading this correctly? Is she implying that I’m trying to hit on her 80-something-year-old husband? First of all, that’s disgusting. Even her son (my ex-boss) is much too old for me according to my personal preferences. And besides that, anyone who knows me knows I have a pretty strong moral compass. I go out of my way to be fair and I would never cheat or help someone cheat. And again… he’s elderly. I see him more like the grandfather I never had. The insinuation makes me nauseous.  
  
So… AITA? And what should I do now? Answer? Block them all? Or both?

AI Monetization Opportunities Expiring FAST!,"Okay, here's a Reddit-style post for your ACA community, focusing on AI monetization and keeping it conversational and engaging:

***

**Subject: Yo, Is Your Content Just…Sitting There? (AI Money's On the Table!)**

Hey ACA Fam,

Ever feel like you're pouring your heart and soul into creating awesome content, but it's just…*there*? Like, not doing anything except collecting digital dust? I feel you! I *used to* feel you!

Seriously, all that work... should be paying you back, right?

But guess what? The AI wave isn't just coming, it's *crashed*! And with it comes some serious opportunities to actually monetize what you're already doing. Thing is, these opportunities aren't gonna stick around forever. (Think limited-time-only burrito bowls…but with cash attached!)

So, what kind of stuff are we talking about?

*   **AI-Powered Repurposing:** Stop manually tweaking content for every platform! AI tools can now take your blog post and turn it into a killer TikTok, a LinkedIn article, and a Twitter thread...all while you grab a coffee (or, you know, work on MORE awesome content!). And guess what? More content = more eyeballs = more opportunity to monetize.
*   **AI-Assisted Content Creation:** Okay, maybe *not* entirely AI-created (we still want *your* authentic voice, duh!). But imagine using AI to brainstorm new ideas, write outlines, or even generate initial drafts. Faster content creation = faster to monetization!
*   **AI-Driven Market Research:** Knowing what your audience *really* wants is half the battle, right? AI can analyze trends and data to help you create content that actually resonates...which leads to better engagement and, you guessed it, more $$$!
*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Think scheduling, social media management, and even answering basic customer questions. Spend less time on the tedious tasks and more time actually creating the content that makes you money.

I know, I know. ""AI"" sounds scary and complicated. But trust me, the barrier to entry is lower than ever. There are so many user-friendly tools out there that can make your life (and your bank account) a whole lot better.

And here's a question I got asked the other day: What if you could just automate the whole darn process?

* Orkhon is married and has a baby coming in 5 months (figured lots of you may be interested in this lmao)

It is compelling enough and just needs to be expanded a little bit more. These are my ideas for a Balatro/Hades/Darkest Dungeon 2 style rogue-like Dispatcher mode.

Every successful call generates cash/approval. Dispatchers must achieve a certain amount of cash/approval to succeed with the shift.

After every shift, Dispatchers gets points depending on their performance. Points can be spent in the middle of shifts on various upgrades

* Upgrading heroes
* Recruiting new heroes
* Training (flying license, personalized upgrades)
* Team building activity (creates synergy)
* Upgrading dispatcher resources (like a better coffee machine)

You can choose different Dispatcher/Team loadouts with different perks and disadvantages.

* Developmental Brand: start with 3 randomized heroes, increased point generation
* Draft pick: Start with a small number of points, recruit heroes from a randomized pool
* Part Timers: Heroes require twice as much rest but generate twice as much cash/approval
* A-Team Aspirants: Twice as much experience gain, when a hero reaches level 5, after a shift, they have a chance to be removed from your team as they are drafted into the A-team. Gain a large number of points for every member recruited
* Workplace Romance/HR nightmare: Heroes are twice as likely to develop synergys, decreased cash/approval generation
* Poached Employee/Lateral Hire: Start with a large number of points
* Open Auditions: Decreased Hero recruitment cost, penalty to experience gained

Every 3rd shift is a boss shift. The amount needed to succeed is exponentially higher and there will be a randomized modifier to make the shift more difficult.

* Heavy rain: Movement of all heroes, including flying heroes, is penalized
* Commitment to Service: Failing to answer a call results in failure
* Riots: Twice as many calls
* Supervillains attack: Risk to injury increased, all calls have increased Combat requirements
* Saboteur: Every call will have a hazard point (the red indicator that can guarantee failure)
* Buddy system: All calls must be answered by at least 2 heroes
* PR Campaign: All calls have increased Charisma requirements, Increased cash/approval requirement
* Puzzler plot: All calls have increased Intellect requirements
* Bombs Everywhere: Calls have shorter call times, All calls have increased Movement requirements

Dispatcher wins if they succeed a certain number of shifts.

1. When ordering coffee (cafe latte/cappuccino) with cake/pastry, the typical way is to bring the cake/pastry first and let the customer to wait, usually 10-20 minutes. By the time the coffee arrives, the cake is already finished. 

2. Coffee is never prepared immediately upon order. No, there is absolutely no hurry to prepare the coffee. It typically takes 15-20 mins to receive it. Normally grinding the coffee, and preparing the coffees serving takes only 60-120 sec (equals to 1-2 minutes), but in India, it takes 10x the time. 

3. When bringing the coffee to the table, the waiter always places it in front of the wrong person. They never use the trick of asking ""Cafe latte?"" and observing which customer reacts to give the cup to the right one. 

4. The waiters are rushing to collect the empty dishes as soon as possible, often even when the customer hasn't even finished yet. Why such a hurry to collect the unfinished dishes, but not feeling any hurry or urgency to serve the coffee on priority basis? Are they signalling I should vacate the table and leave? Though most of the tables are empty...

Food is marvelous. Taste is great! Service is usually good, but these small nuances make me to wonder why there's no hurry to bring the coffee/pastry, but crazy rush to collect the (unfinished dishes) from the table.  ",1,1763645487.0,delhi,0,1.0,False

I am from the US studying in London (England) and I have been renting a flat in Lewisham since September. It has honestly been a nightmare living here, and it's to a point where it's impacting my mental health. I've paid 6 months of rent upfront and have signed a lease for 12 months, I'd just like to move after six months.

For context, I was supposed to move in on the 8th of September, but couldn't because the previous tenants had absolutely trashed the flat and no inspection had been done by the property management prior to me moving in. There was grease and mold all over the kitchen, paint was peeling down the walls and crumbled on the floors from lack of ventilation, the previous tenants left a myriad of trash and personal items that they abandoned. I was obviously angry at the property management but they sent a cleaner the same day to rectify the situation, so I thought everything had been solved and it was best to move on.

The white goods were completely ruined (fridge was riddled with black mold and door was hanging off the hinges, and the oven was caked with grease, charred food, and mold.) They did replace these, but the oven was never installed properly so I had no stove or oven for my first two months of tenancy when I was finally able to get one of their maintenance workers to fix it. He fixed the stove but the oven is still broken.

There were a few items of furniture that were to be included, some of which being dining chairs, that were not in the flat when I moved in. The property manager had told me she would get them delivered. I had asked her for updates on numerous occasions of when to expect them, and would frequently get ignored, left on read, etc. I had been away from the apartment for a couple of days and had received a forwarded message from the property manager about the chairs, stating they were expected 10am-4pm that same day. This message was sent at 3pm, 5 hours into the expected time slot, despite my frequent requests for an update on these chairs. When I entered the apartment, they had delivered the chairs and entered without my notice or consent. They had also broken my coffee table.

I had immediately contacted the property manager and my calls were ignored. I sent her a follow up message saying she needed to call me. After back and forth about this she blocked me on WhatsApp because I was ""messaging her personal number"" despite her number being a business number and never informing me of it being a personal number or being asked not to contact via that number prior to this interaction.

After being blocked, I sent a strong worded email to the management stating all of the unacceptable and downright illegal issues I've had since moving in. They claimed I was in the wrong for harassing them with frequent and out of hours phone calls (calling more than once because they won't pick up the phone or respond to messages, and I called a whopping one time at like 5:30pm.) They said theyre ""noting my behavior"" and accused me of abusing staff. 

I am under constant stress living here, something is always broken with no end in sight to fix it. I feel nervous to contact them about anything, and their reviews on every site match my experiences, so I know it's not a me problem.

I have no break clause in my lease. They've requested the property back after the 12 months is up (likely due to the events above but I'm not sure). I am more than willing to find a replacement tenant for them if need be. I just need to know my rights.)",1,1763645111.0,LegalAdviceUK,0,1.0,False

(ai used because i am in a realm where only thoughts exist)

So yeah, here’s my second transcendental story idea, and it suddenly popped into my head. It’s basically a game for couples. Super simple: whoever wakes up first is the “winner,” and whoever wakes up last is the “loser,” and the loser has to make coffee for both of them. Sounds like a cute cliché, right? But the fun part is the incentives. No matter how much you oversleep—1 hour, 3 hours, whatever—you still have to make just one extra cup of coffee. That’s it. So technically, you get way more sleep than your partner for the same tiny penalty. And if your partner is super competitive and tries to wake up earlier and earlier, that only makes it easier for you to squeeze in another hour of sleep while still paying the same “cost.” So the whole game becomes this weird balance: do you grind and wake up early just to get your coffee made, or do you shamelessly sleep in, accept the L, and enjoy your extra rest because the punishment barely scales? That’s the whole vibe—and honestly, it says a lot about incentives, relationships, and how humans behave when the rules are just slightly rigged.",1,1763645081.0,hyderabad,6,0.57,False

## **COLD OPEN**

**NARRATOR:**  
This is the Smithsonian Institution—  
*the world’s largest museum complex,* home to 19 museums, 21 libraries, 9 research centers, and arguably the highest concentration of mild-mannered superiority on Earth.

Cut to a frantic staff meeting inside the Smithsonian Castle.

**CURATOR #1:**  
Someone stole our rising-star astrophysicist!

**NARRATOR:**  
And this is the Institute for Advanced Study—  
a quiet mathematical paradise in Princeton, New Jersey, where geniuses go to think, argue about tensor fields, and complain about how loud the deer are.

Cut to serene campus. A deer screams in the distance.

**IAS ADMINISTRATOR:**  
We did not “steal” anyone. We poached him quietly and legally, like sea bass.

**NARRATOR:**  
It all started when *Dr. Leo Hennings,* beloved by the Smithsonian astrophysics team, was offered an IAS fellowship.

Cut to Leo packing his office.

**LEO:**  
They just… gave me a chalkboard. A giant one. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.

**NARRATOR:**  
And so the rivalry began.  
Because if there’s one thing smart people hate…

**CUT TO:** split screen of outraged Smithsonian staff and smug IAS fellows.

**NARRATOR:**

# **ACT ONE**

## **INT. SMITHSONIAN CASTLE – CRISIS ROOM – DAY**

**PENELOPE BRIGHT**, Deputy Undersecretary for Cultural Strategy, 40s, brilliant, chronically tired, slaps pie charts onto a smart board.

**PENELOPE:**  
IAS has taken three of our researchers this year. That’s three too many. At this rate, they’ll beat us to discovering—  
(checks notes)  
—“whatever dark baryonic thing we were cooking up.”

**NARRATOR:**  
Penelope was the Smithsonian’s internal glue: a brilliant administrator who had once dreamed of being an archaeologist before discovering she hated sand.

Cutaway: Penelope at age 19 screaming at sand blowing into her tent.

**PENELOPE:**  
We need a counterstrike.

**CURATOR #2:**  
Should we… steal one of *their* scientists?

**PENELOPE:**  
No. Too obvious.

**CURATOR #3:**  
Should we “accidentally” invite their mathematicians to give a talk and then lock the door until they join our staff?

**PENELOPE:**  
Again, too obvious.

She taps the board.  
**PENELOPE:**  
We’re going to win the only way the Smithsonian can:
**a massive, ostentatious, publicly beloved exhibit.**

**CURATOR #2:**  
About what?

**PENELOPE:**  
I don’t know! Space! Dinosaurs! Space dinosaurs!
Whatever makes America applaud us like seals!

**NARRATOR:**  
The Smithsonian had long believed that if knowledge wasn’t public-facing, it was basically hoarding.

The Institute for Advanced Study is dead silent. A chalkboard stands like a shrine.

**DR. ERNST KELLER**, legendary physicist, sits with Leo.

**KELLER:**  
The Smithsonian is upset about your arrival.

**LEO:**  
Should I feel bad?

**KELLER:**  
Absolutely not. They’re an institution designed for the public. We, however, are designed for the pursuit of unbroken thought.

**NARRATOR:**  
Keller hadn’t spoken to a non-academic human being in nine years.  
He was… rusty.

Cutaway: Keller attempting to order coffee.

**LEO:**  
So what do we do?

**KELLER (grim):**  
We respond with dignity.

Beat.

**KELLER:**  
And with a devastatingly polite op-ed.

**CURATOR #3:**  
What about an exhibit on the history of genius rivalries?
Newton vs. Leibniz?  
Edison vs. Tesla?

**CURATOR #1:**  
Smithsonian vs. IAS?

**PENELOPE:**  
No. The public cannot know we have beef with an institution none of them have heard of.

Cutaway: man on the street interview.  
**INTERVIEWER:**  
Have you heard of the Institute for Advanced Study?  
**TOURIST:**  
Is that where they keep the pandas?

Back to scene.

Penelope sighs.

**PENELOPE:**  
Fine. We need a spectacle. Something the IAS can’t ignore.

**CURATOR #2:**  
What if we announce a joint summit?  
Like détente?  
Invite them to a roundtable?

**PENELOPE (suspicious):**  
Why would we do that?

**CURATOR #2:**  
So we can *show off* when they arrive.

**PENELOPE:**  
…That’s actually brilliant.

Penelope and Keller sit across from each other.

**PENELOPE:**  
We propose a joint exhibit celebrating the future of American innovation.

**KELLER:**  
We propose that you cease distracting our scientists with your… flashy dinosaur skeletons.

**PENELOPE:**  
People like dinosaurs.

**KELLER:**  
People like *YouTube*, too. That doesn’t make it intellectually rigorous.

**MINI (to Keller, whispering):**  
Stop antagonizing them, they have fossils.

## **INTERRUPTION**

Leo arrives late, jogging into the room with a backpack.

**LEO:**  
Sorry—train issues.

Everyone stares.

**PENELOPE:**  
Leo.

**LEO:**  
Hi Penelope.

**KELLER (whispering to Mini):**  
This is the one they’re angry about.

**MINI:**  
I gathered.

Penelope softens.

**PENELOPE:**  
Leo… why’d you leave?

He shrugs.

**LEO:**  
Because at IAS I get to think.  
At the Smithsonian… I had to talk all the time.

**PENELOPE (hurt):**  
We thought you *liked* talking.

**LEO:**  
I like the public.  
But I also like… silence.

**NARRATOR:**  
It was the first time either institution had truly heard the other side.

Beat.

**PENELOPE:**  
Fine. We’ll collaborate.  
But only if you promise to return for special events.

**LEO:**  
…You mean the big ones? Outreach? Festivals?

**PENELOPE:**  
Yes.

**LEO (nods):**  
Deal.

**KELLER:**  
We accept the terms.

**MINI (gently):**  
You don’t have to say it like we’re signing a treaty.

**KELLER:**  
We *are* signing a treaty.

**REPORTER #1:**  
Is this a partnership?

**PENELOPE:**  
Yes.

**REPORTER #2:**  
Is there still rivalry?

Looking for an all-round grinder for espresso, milk-based drinks, and filter (batch brew/pour-over). Narrowed it down to **Option-O 01** vs **P80**. 01 has 102 mm burrs, beefier motor, and great workflow; P80 has 80 mm burrs, lower price, and RPM display. Question: How much does burr size matter for my use case? Anything I’m overlooking?

**Hey folks, I need your advice on an upcoming purchase. First things first: I also do batch brew in the morning and pour-over every other day. So, I’m looking for a true all-rounder.**

**A bit of background:**  
I’m coming from a Niche Zero and had the chance to test a Timemore 64 for a while. Surprise: the Timemore was way better for filter coffee than the Niche, who would’ve guessed ;-) Espresso was a bit tricky to dial in, but once set, it was great, just with a completely different profile. The Niche workflow? Nice, but far from perfect. I even played around with 3D-printed discs to force slow feeding. It made a noticeable difference in grind quality. For milk-based drinks, totally fine. But for filter still, I’m grinding 50 g every morning with a ZP6. Delicious, but not practical for daily life.

**My journey so far:**  
Currently I am looking for my personal ""endgame"" grinder. I tried hard to talk myself out of the Weber EG-1 (thanks, YouTube fandom) and succeeded as I discovered the Option-O 01. From everything I’ve read and seen: perfect workflow, consistent results, and a price that’s somewhat reasonable for what you get. I considered the P64 before, but the static issues were a turn-off and it would've been just another step inbetween niche and endgame. The 01 has bigger burrs (102 mm Mizen), an all-round burr set, and the option to upgrade to SSP HU later if I feel like experimenting.

The EG-1? Too expensive for what it offers. So I was set on the 01… until the P80 was announced. Workflow looks amazing, price is aggressive. But: the knocker mechanism doesn’t thrill me, and it’s “only” 80 mm burrs instead of 102 mm.

**Here’s my first concrete question:**  
How much does burr size really matter for my use case? Sure, 80 mm gives me more swap options, but I’m not keen on constantly changing burrs. I assume 102 mm options will expand over time anyway.

One minor gripe: the RPM dial on the 01 just shows 1–9, while the P80 displays actual RPMs. On the flip side, the 01 has a beefier motor, bigger hopper, faster grinding, and those larger burrs.

Titus grinders? Simply too expensive for me and their website is so minimalistic that I don’t feel like spending more time there. The Zerno Z2 is also on my radar, but since it’s not out yet, and honestly, the P80 design appeals to me more, it’s outside my current shortlist.

# Questions for you all:

* Did I miss something important in this comparison?
* Can I safely go for the 01, or is the P80 a better bet?
* What would I lose with the smaller 80 mm burrs compared to the 102 mm Mizens?
* Any real-world workflow differences I should know about?

I'd like someone who's more obsessive than me on this point. 
Honestly, the LDS (Mormon) doctrine aligns a lot with my beliefs. Some say it's a cult, but personally, I fear I'm among the few with a cult mentality because of the bpd black and white thinking mixed with doctrinal rules I believe. I've followed all their rules about health code, chastity, and eternal marriage before, and I always will.

Drinking coffee, alcohol, or tobacco? I'm already paranoid about my appearance, so imagine if I want to make my skin worse by consuming these substances. I don't even drink soda and I don't eat processed foods or pork, for that matter.

Regarding chastity, I have never kissed, nor do I intend to, unless I have the guarantee of dealing with a person who is also chaste and wants to be with me forever.

I could potentially gain experience, but I would quickly become attached and obsessive and if abandoned I would kill myself. So I prefer not to have any.

And that's the main point. I want someone chaste and who wants to share her affection only with me for eternity. 

This is the only way I can imagine relationships. I don't accept compromises.

The problem is that I seem like an extremist even in such religious circles. When literally Joseph Smith used almost the same words I had as a promt on Hinge in doctrine and covenants. 

My relationship goal on hinge 
“I desire a union that will elevate us to the highest level and last for eternity.  A union that can be the beginning of a dynasty.”

D&C:
“If a man marries a woman and makes a covenant with her for time and for all eternity […] will inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, powers, and dominions, all heights and depths […] Then they will be gods, because they have no end; therefore they will be from eternity to eternity, because they will continue; then they will be above all, because all things will be subject to them.”

Either this mindset or nothing.

Unfortunately, I can't connect with people in person due to shyness and insecurity. I'm very successful with numbers on dating apps, but I can't find the right people. Because it's also very important to me that the person I'm dating likes me aesthetically. And I find some who really like me, but they never have the mindset I want.",0,1763644925.0,BorderlinePDisorder,4,0.11,False

1p22zpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1p22zpv/my_solo_trip_to_kazakhstan/,My Solo Trip to Kazakhstan,"I originally posted this in r/Kazakhstan about a solo trip I took to Almaty, Kazakhstan and it got some great feedback so I figured it may be helpful posting this here as well!

I just returned from my first trip to Kazakhstan (August 2025). I wanted to share my experience and hopefully help anyone thinking about planning their trip.

I started this journey in January 2025 after seeing a few Instagram posts and videos about Kazakhstan and Almaty that piqued my interest, and I decided I wanted to go.

**Getting there:** As an aviation nerd, I enjoy flying different airlines, which is why I specifically wanted to fly Air Astana to Almaty. I decided to travel from the US to London Heathrow on Virgin Atlantic. I took advantage of this and opted to coordinate my trip to spend a few days in London. I would highly recommend this if you don't have access to a nonstop flight to Almaty. After a few days in London, I flew nonstop on Air Astana from London Heathrow to Almaty. It was amazing! The Air Astana crew was super kind and friendly, the food was delicious, and they had a cool amenity kit with different themes based on the various destinations and routes they offer. The in-flight entertainment was good. The planes were clean and modern. I recommend flying on Air Astana if you find yourself looking to visit Kazakhstan. They boarded via seat number, not boarding group/zone. In economy, the farther back your seat is, the earlier you board.

**Arriving at the Airport:** The flight landed on time at a remote stand, meaning we had to take a bus to the terminal. Really cool if you are into aviation. The bus took us to Immigration. The process was smooth and quick. They confirmed the city that I was arriving from (London) and stamped my passport! They stamped it on the very last page, which caught me off guard. After Immigration, baggage claim, and customs, you simply exit through goods to declare vs no goods to declare. Once you enter the international arrivals area, there are a number of things going on. You will be approached by folks with lanyards asking if you want a taxi. You do not want a taxi from these folks. A simple ""no thanks"" was enough for them to leave me alone. Here are my tips and recommendations for arriving at Almaty International Airport:

* Go to the Tourist Information Center, which is located to the right as you exit through the sliding doors as you enter international arrivals. They are staffed 24/7. Ask for a ""tourist passport"" and an Oney card. The tourist passport has a ton of helpful info about the city. They also have maps and other awesome things for tourists to help you navigate the city.
* ATMs and currency exchange places are located in the terminal, very easy to find. Get some cash, just a small amount. I ended up getting about $40 USD worth (\~21,000 Tenge). This was more than I needed and lasted the whole trip (I used cards a lot). I'll talk about cards and cash usage further down.
* They do have SIM card places at the airport. I would strongly recommend an e-SIM prior to arrival. My cell carrier has a program allowing for coverage in KZ, so I was able to automatically connect upon landing.
* They have a few options for getting to your accommodation:
   * **Yandex-Go:** This is their Uber, and what I used. It's super easy to use, offered in English, and is safe and reliable. I would strongly advise using this, setting it up prior to your flight, and getting familiar with the basic functions. It's very similar to Uber; I used it to get around the city, and it was great.
   * **Official Airport Taxi:** Although I didn't use it, they do have an official airport Taxi booth. While I can't speak to the price or experience, it is an option.
   * **Bus:** I have seen other travelers take the bus. To my knowledge (and correct me if this has changed since the airport renovation), the bus does not actually come to the terminal. You need to walk down the street to catch it. It's super cheap and takes you to the city center. Definitely a viable option.

**Accommodations:** They have a lot of hotels, Airbnb, as well as unique accommodations on offer. I opted for the Ibis Almaty Jetisu. In my opinion, this was ideally located. Located in the heart of the city, this place offered me the chance to explore many points of interest, with easy access to the Metro and Almaty-2 train station. Additionally, I could use Yandex-Go to reach any place that was out of walking distance. My flight landed at 6 AM in Almaty, and I went straight to the hotel. I was super grateful they were able to get me into a room quickly despite arriving several hours before check-in. I'd opt to pay for the breakfast, which was terrific. Super friendly folks, great location, food was fresh and delicious. I would absolutely stay here again.

**Getting around:**

* **Navigation:** Google Maps worked well for me. There were a few instances where I asked it to navigate me with walking directions from my current location to a specific address, but it had trouble updating as I walked and changed locations. Sometimes it would take me on a much longer route than necessary, but both of these were easily managed. Google Maps does not have transit info for the buses and metro. I also found a few places with hours that didn't match Google Maps. So just be aware.
* **Metro:** The metro was really cool. It is small, only one line, but it was fun and easy to use. Upon entering the station, you'll go through a security checkpoint. It's no big deal; just walk through a metal detector, and you might have your bag searched. You can tap into the station with an Oney card, or you can buy a token at the ticket counter. The ride was 120 tenge (\~$0.22 USD) one way, flat rate regardless of how far you went. No need to tap out at your destination. Just walk through the gates. Each metro station features unique murals or mosaics with different themes, making them worth checking out. The metro is super clean, safe, and easy to navigate.
* **Bus:** The city has buses everywhere. I personally did not find myself in need of a bus, but they are super reliable and readily available. You can use an Oney card to tap on.
* **Walking:** This was my preferred way to get around. I love to walk, and I found Almaty, especially the area around my hotel, to be easily accessible if you prefer to walk.
* **Bikes:** Almaty has a bike share program, but I did not see a single bike share bike. All the stations were empty, and while I saw lots of locals on personal bikes, there were no obvious bike share bikes around.
* **Scooters:** They have electric scooters all over the place. You can rent them via the Yandex-Go app. Be careful because folks will go flying on the sidewalks with little to no warning.

**Things to do:**  
Before I dive into my list of cool things to do, I want to give a huge shoutout to the folks at Visit Almaty, the official tourist department of the city. They have a great social media presence, and I found the videos on Instagram particularly helpful in planning my day-to-day. Check them out as they have videos for all kinds of interests. They also have tourist information centers throughout the city that you can pop into and ask for assistance.

My short list of things to do — this is not by any means everything, just the highlights I enjoyed:

* Zenkov Cathedral
* Koktobe
* Green Bazar
* The Central State Museum of Kazakhstan 
* Almaty-2 train station
* Exploring the various parks
* Soviet building walking tour
* Arbat walking street
* Monuments walking tour

**Cash and Credit Cards:** My Discover credit card did not work, unfortunately; however, I saw the Discover logo on Halyk Bank ATMs, so you should be able to get cash at least. My Visa card worked 100% of the time, so no issues with paying for things. Nearly every place I went accepted cards and just assumed that was how I was paying. That being said, you can still pay with cash, but almost everywhere I went, I had the option for cards, and I never had any issues with using my Visa card. Apple Pay/contactless pay is also readily available.

**Food:** The food was incredible! I would seriously recommend Navat. They have a few locations in the city and a generous menu of Kazakh and regional foods. They are open 24/7, and they do have English menus. There are also plenty of Western brands in Almaty. For me, a highlight in the food scene was the coffee. They have a great coffee shop scene, and the coffee was amazing. TEREZE was a personal favorite. The Green Bazar, a must-see place, features a really cool coffee shop overlooking the main market area: Bowler Coffee Roasters (Kokbazar).

**Safety:** I read a few Reddit posts asking about safety, so I do want to briefly touch on this. The city is safe. As with anywhere, be smart, follow your gut, and don't go anywhere that looks off. At no point in time did I feel unsafe or have any issues. They have police at most tourist hotspots and patrolling the streets. Even at night, the city felt super safe.

**Language barrier:** I also saw some comments or concerns about the potential language barrier. This is my personal experience: Most young people spoke English. At the airport and hotel, it was not a problem. Some older people didn't speak English, but I didn't find it too much of an issue. I downloaded Russian and Kazakh on Google Translate and only had to use it once or twice. I didn't feel that the communication issues were unmanageable; I just needed to be patient, and we would always find a solution. Signage was mixed. A lot of stores had signs in English. Street signs and signs with information would at least have Russian and Kazakh; some would have English. At the airport and hotel, all three languages were present.

**Nightlife:** The nightlife in Almaty was really cool. It was more of a family-friendly vibe vs bar hopping and partying. The walking streets of Almaty come alive, with people gathering with friends and family to enjoy food, watch street performers, and have a great time. It was a serious highlight for me.

**Departing Almaty International Airport:** I wanted to add this in as I had a different experience departing Almaty with Air Astana vs departing London. First, while I was able to check in online via the Air Astana app, I was not able to obtain a digital boarding pass. I was able to do so in London. I got a message saying I needed to collect my boarding pass from the check-in counter. Ok, no big deal, I am one of those people who get to the airport way earlier than necessary anyway. I arrived at the check-in counter, but despite having only carry-on bags, I couldn't get my boarding pass until a specific timeslot. So I hung out landside, exploring both the new international terminal (which is amazing, btw) and the older domestic terminal (which really isn't that bad). For me, this wasn't a huge deal since I like hanging out in airports, but it's something to be aware of. There is a cool airport museum area and plenty of opportunities for last-minute souvenirs at the airport. Once it was time to collect my boarding pass, the process was pretty standard. They'll weigh your carry-on, so just be mindful of that. Security and Immigration checks are conducted, and you get stamped out of Kazakhstan. It is a rather small terminal, so getting there crazy early might not be the most exciting thing. The only two things that I want to point out just so you are fully prepared: some Air Astana flights depart from remote stands, where you board from downstairs (gate numbers are clearly marked). At least, for my flight, the boarding process was significantly less organized. They just started scanning people's boarding passes regardless of seat number or class of service. No announcement or anything. So just be mindful of that. The flight back to London was just as amazing as the one to Almaty — seriously great airline, would recommend.

I hope this was helpful and I really hope you visit Kazakhstan. It's an amazing place and I can't say enough good things about my time there. I'll try my best to answer your questions.

1p22ycp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysphagia/comments/1p22ycp/unexplained_dysphagia_for_5_years/,Unexplained Dysphagia for 5 years,"Hi all,

First time poster and was curious to get everyone’s thoughts on this. I am a 31 year old male who has been suffering from Oral Pharyngeal Dysphagia since 26. It all started one morning when I was drinking coffee and I noticed that liquid was not traveling down the left side of my mouth and throat anymore. At the same time I also noticed shortness of breath (difficulty taking in a deep breath) and horsiness in my voice. 

This all started after I began practicing/singing again(hardcore punk so definitely not great for the vocal chords/throat muscles) so I chalked it all up to muscle tension but I have never been the same since. 

Symptoms:

-Trouble swallowing left side of mouth
-feeling like food is getting caught on that side
-horse/inconstant voice left side.
- and the sensation of nasal regurgitation

I also have some esophageal symptoms, Aerophagia and feeling like food and liquid get stuck in the middle of my chest.

I have seen 4 different neurologist who did not find any evidence of cranial nerve dysfuntion.

I have had a brain mri that was clean, a brain ct that was clean, a mbss which only showed mild stasis in the lower esophagus when swallowing a barium tablet.  

I have had several larynscopies. no lesions or secretion pooling was found so head and neck cancer seems unlikely. I do have swollen lympth nodes pop up from time to time but ultrasounds have shown that they are benign. No visible lumps on neck, I can feel a few when I dig around but doctors don’t notice/aren’t concerned 

The ENT who has been following me who specializes in dysphagia believes I have an idiopathic/functional form of dysphagia caused by hypersensitivity. I am an anxious person but a part of me doesn’t buy this.

I guess my question is, in light of all these tests should I continue perusing an answer? I have accumulated thousands of dollars of debt trying to figure this out and have gotten no where. I just ran a half marathon and placed second in a BJJ tournament so other than my swallowing mechanism I am ironically in the best shape of my life.

I will also add that I believe I have TMJ(tight Jaw and grating noises when chewing) and I have pretty bad forward head posture and had some cervical neck degeneration that showed up on a mri when I was 14. Could this be contributing to the issue?

Appreciate everyone’s thoughts!

Could you give me a feel for the vibe in Soufriere, and what there is to do and see near town and within an hour’s drive or easy day trip? 

Here’s a bit about us and what would keep us happy:
- prefer modest simple accommodations and services over luxurious things like fancy hotels and restaurants or spas
- enjoy sandy beaches for wading and swimming, short beach walks, walks to waterfalls or to spy animals in the forest
- modest accommodations in somewhat quiet surroundings
- a few spots to have a coffee, snacks or simple meals

1p22xki,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p22xki/the_disappearance_of_veronica_clark_in_the_town/,The disappearance of Veronica Clark in the town of Bellmare,"The following report is one submitted by Special Agent Theodore Lewis about his field notes while investigating the disappearance of Veronica Clark in the town of Bellmare. It is the last report Special Agent Lewis would give.

\--Start of report--

17 year old Veronica Clark disappeared from her hometown of Bellmare after informing her parents she was going to meet with her best friend, Donna Wright, on April 15th 1995. When Veronica had not returned by the next morning, her parents had informed the local station before Deputy Palmer called my office to inform Deputy Director Jennings of the disappearance. By 13:00 hour, I had been sent to the town of Bellmare to report on the situation and whether a crime had taken place in the quaint area or if this was another case of a teenage runaway.

When Deputy Director Jennings first gave me the case, I did not understand why the FBI had been called on a possible kidnapping. However, I later learned that the missing teenager's father, Roger Clark, was an important official within his town and his daughter could have taken due to his reputation within the community.

The first place I went after entering Bellmare was to speak to the girl's parents, who were quick to ask me questions about my investigation. When I explained I had just arrived, the mother seemed agitated while the father seemed to be calmer than his wife. He asked his wife to brew a pot of coffee while he pulled me aside, explaining that he believed his wife was overreacting to the situation and that his daughter would be back any time now. I thanked him for his opinion before I began my questioning.

""When was the last time you saw Veronica?"" They shared an glance between the two of them before Mr Clark answered.

""Last night, it was before dinner and she told us she was going to be with a friend instead. It must have been four or five in the afternoon by then."" I wrote down his answer before asking my follow up question.

""A friend? Would that be Donna Wright?"" Mrs Clark nodded, answering my question quickly. ""And have you had any contact with Miss Wright or her parents?""

Her parents thought for a moment before they shook their head, there was a look in Mrs Clark's eyes as her hand moved to cover her mouth.

""Oh God, you don't think Donna could be-"" She didn't finish her sentence, looking at her husband who seemed to have found a similar answer that she had as his eyes became equally wide. Mr Clark stood up suddenly.

""I need to call her father, he's an officer.""

""That is not necessary, Mr Clark, I just ask that you and your wife stay at home in case Veronica or anyone else tries to get in contact with you."" Mrs Clark looked at me with a confused expression.

""Anyone else? What like a kidnapper?""

""Don't say that Rosemary."" Mr Clark told his wife but he appeared to having the same thoughts as his wife. I handed my card with my contact information to Mr Clark before I left their home, moving further in the town to the local high school. I also told Deputy Palmer to find Officer Wright so he could be present while I spoke to his daughter.

I entered the high school and found Donna Wright in a science class with the rest of her peers. I pulled her out of her class and took her to the principle's office as we awaited her father's arrival.

Officer Wright appeared almost an hour later, he was almost drenched in sweat and appeared frightened. When he saw his daughter, he immediately embraced her, a cry escaping him before he composed himself, explaining to me that Mr Clark had called him before Deputy Palmer had told him I wanted to talk to him.

My interview with Donna Wright was short, she was unwilling in giving any answers that could help. I asked if she had been with Veronica last night and she told me she had not left her home or seen Veronica since that morning. I asked if she knew where Veronica had gone and she denied any knowledge. Finally, I asked if Veronica had a boyfriend or had mentioned anyone recently. Donna Wright looked unsure on whether to answer before her father told her to be honest and she sighed.

She told me that Veronica had been spending a lot of time with Tommy. I asked her who Tommy was and she told me she did not know. I asked Officer Wright and after thinking for a while about the name, he told me that the local butcher had a son named Tommy. I asked which class he was in but Officer Wright shook his head, informing me that Tommy was not registered at the high school and was instead taught by his father.

I thanked Officer Wright and his daughter for their help before I left the high school, asking for directions as I entered the butcher shop. The entire shop smelt of rotting meat. The smell of blood had somehow filled the air that should of been cold with how much ice they had. Behind the counter, there was a boy who could not have been older than twenty.

""Are you Tommy?"" I asked, showing him my badge. He did not seem alarmed, in fact, he looked like he was waiting for me to show up.

""I had nothing to do with what happened to Veronica."" I looked at him with a somewhat confused expression.

""What happened to Veronica?"" He rolled his eyes.

""You know what I mean. She told her friend Donna about us and now you think I did something to her cause she's gone missing. Well I didn't, she's probably fine, you know? I bet she's smoking pot with Harry, the slut. Did Donna tell you that? If anything happened to Veronica, Harry would know. They spend so much time together."" I could tell there was a bitterness to his words but I did not continue to talk to him. I thanked him for his help before I left the shop, making sure to take in a huge breath of fresh air from the outside.

From what I learned from Deputy Palmer, Harry Roman was a known troublemaker. Smoking, constant drug busts, the idea of him and Veronica Clark knowing each other was 'unheard of', according to Deputy Palmer. That did not bother me as I asked where I could find him. Deputy Palmer told me he was unsure but he knew that Harry would be in school the next morning as that is when he does most of his deals. I thanked Deputy Palmer and asked him if there was a local motel I could spend the night in.

He pointed me towards the direction of a motel as I went there for a night, taking a file with me to put together any information I could get.

There wasn't a lot so far, but I was hopeful that we would find either a crime scene or evidence of where Veronica Clark was by the next night.

When morning arrived, I left my motel room and returned to Bellmare's high school. I called out Harry's name and was quick to find him when he turned to meet my face. He thought about running before he sighed, turning and putting his hands up.

""Okay, you caught me. I'll stop.""

""I'm not here about that. Veronica Clark, you know her?""

He let out a laugh as if I was being crazy.

""Veronica? Everyone knows Veronica, she's our future prom queen and I may have sold to her a few times, no big deal."" He was shoving his hands back into his pocket. The more time I was spending with Harry Roman, the more I was not enjoying his company.

""You dealed to her, what did you sell?""

He shrugged at me.

""A bit of pot here and then, oh and last week she asked for this root."" I pushed him for more answers.

""A root?""

""Yeah, I don't know, man. I had to buy it from this weird lady in town. But hey, she paid me triple the amount I brought it for!"" He seemed pleased with this. As I wish to continue my questioning, my pager began to beep with a message from Deputy Palmer. I turned off my pager and turned around, moving to return to the station. Before I left, Harry Roman called out to me one last time. ""Hey, there's a party tonight in the field behind the school, you should come! It's going to be wild.""

I made a note to inform the local officers of this drug filled party before I returned to the station, meeting Deputy Palmer who showed me what they had found in a bush on the edge of town.

A blood stained blouse.

""Is that Veronica's?"" I asked, Deputy Palmer seemed upset.

""The shirt is, we still need to get the blood tested."" He looked at me as the blouse was handed to one of the lab technicians to be tested. ""Mr Clark has given us permission to enter his daughter's room, I need you to join us."" I agreed and we all left the station, returning to the the home of the Clark family as we entered Veronica Clark's bedroom.

Her room was rather clean, light pink walls and a fluffy pink carpet on her wooden floors. There were a few posters up on the walls and a mirror standing up on it's own. Her bed sheets were settled on the mattress and folded nicely under each other. I went to her desk, looking at the wooden furniture as I went through each drawer she had. As soon as I got to the lowest drawer, it was locked. I was confused as I looked around her room until I found a small key hidden within her pillow. I was able to use it to open the drawer as inside I found a crumpled up piece of paper. I picked it up and read it carefully.

""Consume Valerian root a minute before midnight covered in the blood of a hoofed animal to find the true answer.""

The note was rather vague but I took it, leaving her bedroom as I moved to where Mr and Mrs Clark were sitting, huddled against one another before looking up at me with an expectation.

I was unable to actually tell them anything but I did have my own questions for them.

""Do you know anyone, a woman, who sells roots?""

A sigh escaped Mr Clark's mouth at my question.

""Yes, Miss Mystery.""

""Miss Mystery?"" His wife nodded as confirmation.

""No one knows her real name, but no one really talks to her. She acts like everything has a soul and she can read people, she's crazy.""

""Rosemary!""

""I'm sorry Walter but it's true! She's a crazy old bat and if she knows anything about what happened to Veronica then she should be treated like the witch she acts like and burned at the stake!""

Mr Clark grabbed his wife's head, burrowing it into his chest.

""I'm sorry about that, Agent Lewis, my wife is just worried about our daughter."" Mr Clark grabbed a pen and paper near to him as he wrote something down quickly. ""Here, she's right on the edge of town. You shouldn't miss her, she never leaves her shop.""

I took Mr Clark's advice and left the Clark residence, making my way to the edge of town until I found a shop labelled ""Miss Mystery's odd shop"". It was getting late by this point and I should of just returned to my motel room, but the time Veronica Clark had been missing was increasing with each minute that went by and I could not waste another second.

Bells jingled as I entered the odd shop, looking around. There were many items I did not understand, it was a whole new world for me and I was unsure on what was happening.

""Greetings Special agent."" I span on my heels, reaching for my weapon until I saw who had called my name. An elderly woman with long white hair, glassy eyes and pale skin. She was wearing a strange purple hat wrapped around her head as she wore a light purple dress that almost hanged off her. She smiled at me. ""I have been waiting for you. Come, sit.""

I took a seat next to her table covered in a dark velvet fabric, looking at her as she sat slowly stirring her tea.

""Are you Miss Mystery?"" I asked.

""Yes, I am. And you are from the FBI. It's been a long time since we've had one of you around here, which girl went missing now?"" Her voice was dry before she brought the tea to her lips, taking a long sip.

""Veronica Clark, I was told that you sold a root to a Harry Roman?""

Miss Mystery let out a hum.

""Oh yes, Miss Veronica, what a lovely young girl. And Harry, I couldn't believe my eyes when he entered my shop. But when Veronica came in a few days later, I understood.""

""So you have seen Veronica Clark?""

She let out a humourless laugh.

""My eyes may look like glass, Special Agent, but I can still see when I need to."" She smiled at me. ""She has gone missing, has she? I cannot be surprised by that.""

""May I ask why?""

Miss Mystery let out a hum as she placed a hand out in front of her, putting it down on the table.

""You have something that can help you understand why.""

I don't know how I understood, but I did. I pulled out the still crumpled paper and handed it to Miss Mystery. She took it, reading it back out loud to me.

""Consume Valerian root a minute before midnight covered in the blood of a hoofed animal to find the true answer."" She frowned as she finished reading the words, shaking her head. ""No, no, that's not right. It's meant to be a minute after, not before. Oh God, no."" She stood up suddenly, taking the note with her with shaky hands as she picked up a piece of Valerian root, coming back over to the table and handing it to me with a closed fist. ""You need to find her.""

""That's what I've been doing."" She shook her head.

""No, she's not somewhere you can see just yet. She's in Bellmare but not this town, but she will be trapped if you do not find her soon."" I was confused but still I listened to her words. ""You must do what she did but after midnight, that is important. A minute after midnight, okay? You must take her out of the other Bellmare before the entity takes her away.""

My pager went off again but I ignored it, looking at Miss Mystery as her eyes kept me trapped.

""The entity? What like a demon?"" I asked, not fully believing what she was saying as I thought about leaving her. Her hand grabbed onto my wrist as I felt her sharp nails dig into my skin.

""No, no demon here. It is a entity, it has been in this town since the beginning, it takes those who are vulnerable and it does not let it go. I know it is still here, I have seen it, I have felt it."" Her eyes were wide and wild.

""Do you have any proof?""

She let out a guttural laugh.

""Proof, look at me!"" Miss Mystery's grip tightened on my wrist as I bit back my tongue. ""I was able to escape but others are not so lucky, I try to warn those who come looking for help to stop what has always been here but I cannot. I cannot!"" She finally let go of my wrist, pushing the crumpled piece of paper back towards me. ""This is your only chance to find her, do it!""

With a snap of her fingers, I found myself walking out of her shop and returning to my car. Night had fallen quickly around as the darkness surrounded my vision. I ignored the night the most I could as I began to drive.

I thought about ignoring what Miss Mystery had said, return to my motel room and return the next morning, but I couldn't. I wanted to but I just couldn't. I looked down at my watch, only an hour until midnight. I sighed, looking back up before I felt my feet moving and my eyes widening. A deer staring back at me. I slammed on my brakes but it was too late, my car crashing against a deer and spinning towards a tree, wrapping around it as I felt my own head spin.

There was pain throughout my body but I ignored it, pushing my door open and escaping the crash as I looked at the front of my car. It was covered in the blood of the deer, the headlights broken and splashed in red. My hand grabbed onto the car to stop my head from spinning, my fingers touching the warm blood as I recoiled, wiping the blood on my shirt as I began to walk away. My legs were stumbling as I focused on the bright light in front of me. My knees buckled under me, causing my body to fall against the cold wet grass as I spat out some blood.

I looked down at my watch, midnight.

With all the strength I still had, I dug deep in my pocket for the root Miss Mystery had handed to me, bringing it up as my eyes stayed trained on my watch. As soon as the hands ticked to a minute past, I clamped down on the root, biting and tearing through it until I could swallow it down. I gulped and sighed, letting my eyes shut as my fingers grazed against my pager once more.

When I awoke, I was in a room that I recognised, Veronica's bedroom.

But there was something wrong with it's appearance, wrong.

The room was must larger, everything stretched away from one another. Her wooden desk was in a broken pile while her bed was a mess of dirt, blood staining her pillow and parts of her blankets. I was able to walk normally without any pain as my feet moved forward, a squelch reaching my ears. I looked down, jumping away as the once pale pink carpet was replaced with a collection of blood and guts. An eyeball in the middle of the mess stared back at me, blinking. I swore loudly before I ran, trying to move away but only feeling more wetness of meat under my feet with each move I made.

I screamed, running once more until I found myself in a different room.

It was colder, darker. I couldn't see any walls or floors but I knew they were there. I looked in front of me as the sound of fingers clicking.

A light shone in front of me, a dark figure staring back at me.

""Hello Teddy."" It called to me, I felt my breath being taken away.

""What the hell are you?"" I asked, shifting to grab my gun only to find it was gone. ""What do you want?""

""Want?"" The figure laughed wildly. ""I want nothing, I need everything."" The figure clicked it's fingers once more as I could see the missing girl, Veronica Clark. She was covered in blood, her nose bleeding and her strawberry blonde hair a mess. She was wearing a pink nightgown as she was shaking, looking up at me with fear in her eyes.

""Veronica? Veronica, my name is Special Agent Lewis, I'm here to bring you home, okay?"" She nodded at me, holding her hair over the lower half of her face.

""She will never leave."" I turned to face the dark figure.

""What did you do to her?"" I asked, my feet moving towards her. She let out a scream, causing me to stop as I watched her hair move upwards, causing her to move further away. I planted my feet back down, her screams ending as I did so.

""Me, nothing but him-"" The figure transformed in front of me, the dark air changing until I saw the figure of Mr Clark in front of me. ""He is a monster.""

Veronica looked frightened at the sight of her father, letting out small sounds of disagreements as she tried to move away from him.

""No, no, no!"" She continued to scream, grabbing at her hair and ripping out parts of it.

""Get away from her!"" I moved forward but the room stretched, causing Mr Clark and Veronica to move with it. ""Why are you doing this?""

""I need to feed, Teddy, I take those who are broken and I give them a life with people who will care for them. Veronica-"" At the sound of her name, the teenager flinched. ""She needs a new life, one away from the problems of her life. Her father, her friends, the ones who say they love her but did not try to save her. I can give her that.""

I thought back to what Miss Mystery had told me as I knew who I was talking to was the entity she had mentioned. I watched Veronica's terrified eyes as I spoke.

""You need to let her go.""

The entity laughed loud, slapping Mr Clark's knee.

""Let her go? She doesn't want to go, isn't that right, sweetheart?"" He grabbed Veronica's chin, forcing her to speak as tears continued to fall down her face.

""Please-"" The entity looked displeased as he pushed her away, throwing her down to the floor with a heavy thud. A sob escaped her as she held her face in her hands until her sobs transformed into laughs, deep giggles that filled the room. Her hands left her face, looking up at me with a chilling smile and wild eyes as the blood that once covered her was gone. Her laughs echoed the room until she let out one last final scream, the noises that escaped her throat becoming raw and her eyes rolling into the back of her head. She slumped to the ground, her body shaking until she fell silent.

The entity grinned.

""See? She's happy to be here.""

I tried to rush forward but the entity clicked it's fingers, pushing me to the ground as it's form changed again, the sight of Veronica Clark placing itself on the entity.

""Oh Teddy, you can't save everyone.""

""Veron-""

""Goodbye Teddy, I'll see you in thirty years.""

With the click of it's fingers, I awoke in a hospital bed. Deputy Palmer was by my bedside, standing up as soon as he noticed my eyes open.

""Special Agent Lewis, how are you feeling?"" I let out a groan.

""I'm fine, what happened?""

""How much do you remember?""

I thought about the sight of Veronica and grabbed onto Deputy Palmer, staring up at him.

""I hit a deer and I saw Veronica, she was trapped, we need to find her."" I tried to sit up but Deputy Palmer stopped me, making me lay back down.

""Special Agent, no, no. You've been unconscious since the crash, we found you on the grass. You messaged me.""

I thought back to the crash, laying on the grass as I bit down on the root, my fingers reaching for my pager. I tried to remember sending a message to Deputy Palmer but I just couldn't. I couldn't remember anything but the sight of the entity looming over Veronica.

""But I saw her, Veronica-""

Deputy Palmer sighed.

""Special Agent Lewis, Veronica is dead."" My eyes widened.

""What, no, how?""

""The blood on her shirt came back positive, our techs say it was too much for her to have survived. We're opening a murder investigation and starting a search for her body.""

""But I saw her! She was in front of me, she was right there!""

Deputy Palmer did not believe me, leaving the room as I laid in my hospital bed, hearing the noises of the hospital machines as I sighed.

I know what I saw, I know it was real.

Veronica is still alive, she's out there trapped in a different world, going through things I could not imagine. If I could find Miss Mystery, ask her for help, I could get her back, I swear I could.

You got to believe me, please, you've got to believe me.

It's the truth.

It's the truth.

It's the truth.

It's the truth.

It's the truth

It's-

\--End of Report--

Special Agent Lewis' report continues for the next ten pages repeating the same phrase. After receiving this message from Special Agent Lewis, he was placed in a psychiatric facility indefinitely and placed on leave from his position in the FBI. The disappearance of Veronica Clark in the town of Bellmare has been given to cold cases as the later murder investigation ended with no body found or suspects arrested. The case will stay with cold cases until a new agent can be assigned.

Any attempts to inform Special Agent Lewis of the update in the case has left Special Agent Lewis screaming out to stop the ""Entity"" mentioned in his report. We have tried to find the ""Miss Mystery"" mentioned in this report but was left empty handed after discovering no one in the town knew of a ""Miss Mystery"" or her ""Odd shop"".

We believe that Special Agent Lewis' consumption of Valerian root caused hallucinations that may have led to his beliefs in seeing Veronica Clark and his later health problems. We believe that a local dealer named Harry Roman may have been the one to supply Special Agent Lewis during his short time in Bellmare.

Deputy Director Jennings apologises for the actions of his agent and promises to make a change to his office.

We apologise for any distress Special Agent Lewis has caused and will do better in the future.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Happiness is a choice and choose to work now and live everyday.

You will find people studying hard, be with them, get your doubts resolved, take suppliments, improve your diet. Sleep 8 hours everyday. Attend the weddings that came along. Increase your strength by creating it's need.

1p22tc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1p22tc9/cheaper_accessoires_recommendation_black_friday/,'Cheap'(er) Accessoires Recommendation - Black Friday Deals?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for affordable wooden options for the portafilter handle and the steam knob. Most of the sets I’ve found are over €100, which feels a bit excessive. How did you find cheaper alternatives? Any recommendations for sellers in **Europe**?

Also, what accessories do you currently use, and which ones did you buy thinking you needed them but later realized they were unnecessary or a waste of money? I’d really appreciate honest opinions. I don’t want to throw money away on pointless stuff.

And one more thing: any cheap way to get a protection cover for the machine? Is there a DIY option? What kind of material or layering works best for a dust- or splash-proof cover?

Thanks in advance for your honest experiences!

1p22t8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1p22t8u/dont_try_to_be_a_hero/,Don’t try to be a hero.,"It was a sunny morning about half eight if I remember correctly and I was sitting there staring out the window waiting for a waitress to come to take my order in this nice quiet cafe. Then again I was in Florida so I suppose I should call it a diner as that’s what it was, hadn’t been there too long before my mind started wandering like it does thinking about home and wondering how long until I think I'll be ready to go back there.

Then I snapped out of it when I heard darling for about the third time next to me, I looked up to see a blonde smiling at me she had her hair up and was wearing the typical white blouse and checkered apron holding a glass pot of coffee, as she could see she finally had my attention she asked if I wanted to look at the menu and I nodded as she placed it in front of me on the table she asked if I would like coffee I said “no but I’ll have a tea if you do any” she gave me a chipper “oh your British” then listed off all sorts of ice teas.

I responded quite blankly “no English tea?” She blinked a few times, probably trying to give herself some thinking time then finally said “oh yeah you brits like it warm, well we can make you some sweet tea” I of course asked her questionably “what's sweet tea?” she gives me a little umm along with a head tilt “well we take some tea bags in a pot with some sugar and bring it to the boil” I sighed and said “that will do but can you bring me some milk with that” and of course she looked at me confused but said of course.


Page 1
I started looking out the window again listening to the four or five other patrons eating and drinking, listening to the cook shouting at the waitress saying “what do you mean English tea” and her replying with “well that's what the customer wants so that's what he’ll have” I managed to finally drown that out by listening to the other waitress making another pot of coffee.

I then remembered that a full English isn’t exactly a thing in U.S diners so I started looking through the menu and found a few things that could make a full English so I just needed to remember scrambled egg and bacon, french toast and potato pancakes… they looked like hash browns to me so I was going to give them a go, my waitress finally came back to me holding a glass coffee pot but with what looked like some strong tea in it.

She placed it down and asked would I like some more milk in that but I just wanted food at this point so I shook my head and said “no it looks great thank you” she smiled at me and asked ""What part of Britain are you from as I can tell your British but couldn't tell from where"" I replied to her ""South Wales"" and she of course had no idea where that was so I quickly explained the layout of Britain and she somewhat understood but I’m positive it went over her head mostly.

I looked for a name tag but she oddly didn’t have one so I asked “what's your name” and she looked down to her chest and squeaked “oh I forgot my name tag again but I’m Wendy nice to meet you” she ended the sentence with an upward inflexion almost like a question so I replied “hello Wendy I’m Steven nice to meet you too” she gave me a smile and said “I saw you looking at the menu does that mean you know what you would like to order?”

Page 2
I looked back down at the menu and said “yes I would like”… then paused as I heard a car quickly pull into the car park and squealed to a stop, I looked out expecting to see someone quickly open a door but nothing. I looked at Wendy and chuckled “someone must be hungry” she gave me a little laugh back as a response, I looked back down at the menu and asked for the scrambled eggs and bacon I heard the car doors open and close three of them I thought, “I umm…"" I say as I’m trying to remember what else I wanted then “oh the potato pancakes” I hear her jot it down quickly and give a little mhm then the door opens.

Wendy looked up and give a friendly “hello folks just sit down anywhere one of us will get to you soon” she looked back at me and I was just about to ask for my french toast when I heard an ever so recognisable metallic drag followed by an even more recognisable metallic click, I hear an accent I haven’t heard in a while an Irish man shouting out ”nobody move” but of course everybody looks up including myself there they were two men and a woman, the taller twitchy one had a sawed-off shotgun the smaller more confident one had a pistol of some kind of 9mm most likely and the woman was grasping onto a switchblade with both hands.

I looked back at Wendy and asked for the french toast, she quickly looked at me with a “huh!?” I was about to repeat myself when I heard a “hey hey!” Along with three footsteps, “shut up the lot of ya” he said while flailing his pistol “in fact all of you put your hands on the tables” he slowly spins on his heels watching everyone putting their hands on the tables and again just flailing the pistol around “now my brother here will come around with a bag and you're going to put anything of worth into it” he demanded confidently.


Page 3
His brother on the other hand looked anything but confident. Thumbling around in his pocket, he eventually pulled out a hessian sack. They started at the far end of the dinner away from me, while the both of them had their backs turned away from me I poured myself a cup of tea and lifted it slightly in a cheers motion to the woman still standing by the door still gripping the blade with both hands I took a sip and smacked my lips together in slight disappointment.

“Well Wendy it's not a proper cup of tea but it’ll do” she looked at me shocked and through gritted teeth she asked me ""what the hell are you doing!"" I looked back at her and said “having a drink clearly”, the man with the pistol span around at us and shouting again for me to shut up and to get my hands on the table. I sighed and placed one hand on the table, as I took another mouth full of tea then placed the cup down on the table. ""Take your hand off the mug"" he asked with a slight hint of frustration.

I placed my hand flat on the table he gave me a look and a slight node before turning around again back to his brother and the people they both had at gunpoint I looked back at the woman and she was just staring at me but when she wasn’t she was looking out the door, so the driver I thought to myself she started staring at me again I give her a come over gesture with my head and she shook her head frantically.

I gave her a little smile and gestured to her again and she shook even harder. I'm guessing the pistol man saw her in the corner of his eye because he turned around quickly, saw she was looking at me and then slapped her. He marched over to me, hit me square on the nose through the whimper of the woman and the scream of Wendy. I heard him say with his heavy Irish accent right in my ear “don’t you look at my girl again or I’ll have you”.
Page 4
I could feel my nose filling up with bloody mucus and my eyes wanting to water but me being me I chuckled and said “she was the one staring at me I just wanted to say hello”, his eyes lit up with anger and with his pistol still pointing at me he turned to his girl and asked if this is true and of course she just shook her head why wouldn’t she when the man that apparently loves you slaps you so hard you start to cry.

“Hey hey hurry up over there as this welshy needs an eye kept on him” he shouts to his brother, I look up at him and ask “so what part of Ireland are you from I can hear it's northern but where?” “Never you mind” he snaps back at me but surprisingly his brother speaks up and says “a little coastal town a half-hour drive outside of Belfast”, the one holding the pistol shouts back at him to shut up and hurry up but again I ask “what's the town called as I know Ireland fairly well”.

Of course the pistol holder tells me to shut up but again the other brother speaks up and tells me the town of Larne I smile and say “oh I know Larne there's a lovely chippy not too far from the church” the pistol holder hits me again this time on my left temple knocking me to the side slightly the brother shouts out “stop Johnny you said this wouldn’t get violent” I looked at Johnny as his anger grew even higher “what the hell are you doing saying my name”, his brother stutters out a “I-I’m sorry but just stop hitting the poor fella”.

“Poor fella” Johnny shouted “he isn’t a poor fella he’s a cocky son of a gun that's what he is” I looked up at him taken back by the punch and the fact I now know his name, “right come here” gesturing to his brother then turned to Wendy and grabbed her by the arm and threw her into the seat across from me she of course started screaming “don't hurt me oh my god don’t hurt me” his brother stood next to him and Johnny took hold of the sawn-off and pointed it towards Wendy. 
Page 5
Wendy started crying and you probably would too if you had two shotgun barrels pointed at your face then Johnny pointed his pistol towards me then stated “right my girl is now going to come around with a bag and finish collecting your valuables and if any of you try anything funny these two are going to die”, his girl trembled as she pulled a smaller hessian sack out of her jacket and very hesitantly started walking towards the table where the brother left off.

I looked at the brother that looked both shocked and terrified the fact he’s holding a gun closer to a person than he probably ever thought he would “hey what’s your name” I say while looking at the brother Johnny leans in screaming down my ear “never you bloody mind what his name is, shut up or I’ll put some lead in your skull you eejit”, I look at his brother again and tilt my head up at him slightly he stuttered out “I-Ian my name is Ian” “nice to meet you Ian I’m Steven” I replied.

Johnny screamed down my ear again “shut the Feck up!” then looked at Ian screaming “why the Feck are you talking to him so damn much you want me to kill this eejit, or are you going to do it” Ian just shakes his head and goes back to watching Wendy, I look at the woman still trembling as she’s holding the knife in one hand and the bag in the other but not moving just looking down at the table, I suppose I had Johnny’s complete attention so he didn’t notice her I look back at Ian “hey Ian you don’t want to hurt anyone do you let alone kill anyone” he didn’t say or do anything as Johnny started shouting again.

“Ok Welshy anymore talk out of you and your brain is going to splatter all over the waitress” Ian finally shook his head telling me enough “hey Johnny you're no killer, wife-beater maybe but no”… bang! Followed by complete darkness, I don’t know how long I was out for but I’m assuming not long as the screaming hadn’t stopped.
Page 6
The loudest was Wendy and so was Ian but screaming about how that shouldn’t have happened there was no need to kill him there was more screaming in the back but I don’t think any of them was from the woman, I finally realised what happened when I could feel my warm blood dripping down either side of my face and pooling on the table as well as the throbbing headache in the back of my headthe damn Irish man known as Johnny shot me in the back of my head.

I fully opened my eyes and just stared at the table until I heard Johnny move he was leaning over me I could feel him looking at Wendy and saying somewhat calmly “right love, if you don’t want to be next you’ll walk my brother to the safe, the register and wherever else you keep money in this lovely establishment” I heard her get up and start to walk away followed by Ian, while they walked Johnny announced to everyone else “this is why you don’t try to be a hero because you end up dead!” I then heard Johnny getting close to me again. I felt him grab my shoulder to tip me up and I knew this was my time.

When he pulled me back into the seat I looked him straight in the eyes and quickly punched him square in the neck I stood up while he stumbled back and trying to aim the gun at me, I grabbed his arm pushing the gun into the air and uppercutting him forcing him to stumble even more he lost his grip on the gun and even dropped it in the process of me wrapping both arms around his head giving it a hard twist then crack… Johnny’s neck broke between my arms and his body fell to the floor like a sack of spuds.




Page 7
I felt all eyes on me but mostly the girls just staring at me not screaming like everyone else but just silently staring, It brought my attention to Ian there he was mouth agape and holding the gun in my direction “hey Ian put the gun down you don’t want to hurt any of those people you don’t want to hurt me and revenge is overrated, by the looks of it you were dragged into this and you had some conditions that clearly got broke this isn’t your fault and all you need to do is put the gun down and walk out”.

“Plus I don’t really want to kill you either”… bad words on my part as that mildly snapped him out of it in the wrong way, he quickly pointed the gun back to Wendy and he started shouting at me “right well maybe a gun won't kill you but I’m pretty sure it will kill her if you get any closer to me”, I sighed “Ian I don’t want to kill you just stop this and walk away and just pretend you weren’t even here”.

I could see the worry in his eyes and my words were sinking in he was genuinely considering it then out of nowhere a sharp pain hit my back I let out a scream in pain as I quickly turned around to face and hit who or what just hit me, I was shocked to see the girl his woman standing there with her knife still in hand but now covered in blood my blood, I was taken aback by the fact that she stabbed me with zero emotion.

She lunged towards me assuming to try and stab me again but without thinking I uppercut her as she stumbled I grabbed the knife and pulled it out of her hand, when she hit the floor I apologised for hitting her I really didn’t mean to it was a reflex then this girl looked up at me with glee… she had a Cheshire Cat smile this was the only other emotion I saw this woman do and it's a large smile from being hit!

Page 8
I looked at her almost in disgust but quickly feeling sorry for this woman and I couldn’t help myself from speaking out loud “how badly messed up are you to smile for getting hit”, I quickly turned and shouted to Ian “what the hell was your brother doing to that girl to make her like this!?” “I-I don’t know” he stuttered out half-heartedly.

“I feel like you do and I really hope you weren’t a part of it” he looked up at me with genuine fear in his eye “n-no I would never” he somehow manages to say to me without wetting himself “he just somehow manipulated her into being like this, no talking back, showing enjoyment when he said sorry for hitting her, practically ra”… “don’t even finish that!” I shouted at him in anger “so you know all this because of one of two reasons, one you were there enjoying it with your twisted brother maybe even beating her yourself or two you were there watching in the background still enjoying it but didn’t want to get involved so which one was it!”

He shook his head “n-no no! It wasn’t like that yes I was there yes I knew what he was doing but I didn’t watch I could just hear I tried to drown it out because I knew I couldn’t stop it from happening or he would turn on me”, he screamed out with tears starting to roll down his cheeks “well then Ian” I said before a large exhale “as I said just walk away you’ve done nothing wrong but you’ll still get locked up for being involved if you don’t”.

He looked at the girl then back at me “I’ll get her to a hospital” I say to try and comfort him I could see his lip start to quiver and waver like he’s trying to speak but nothing until “n-no you can’t she knows too much I’ll still get locked up” “if she talks but she won't will she!” I snap at him “I feel like you might have feelings for this girl but until she gets some help she won’t be able to feel them let alone return them”.
Page 9
He shakes his head “no it's not like that I just don’t want to get locked up because of her talking” he swings his arm around to her pointing the shotgun at her I quickly unholster my Enfield revolver that I was still carrying at the time and pointed it at him square between the eyes, “right you really don’t want to do that or I’ll have to kill you just like I did your brother”.

He looked down at Johnny's lifeless body then back at me still crying but no longer angry just sad almost sorrow then muttered “maybe that's for the best” then bang… I couldn’t do anything he turned the shotgun on himself so quickly I couldn’t even react, the damn idiot actually killed himself and for what not to go to jail or that’s what I thought as I saw his head fly back from the buckshot but no dear Wendy somehow moved fast enough to move his hands just enough that the only thing he shot was the tip of his nose and the ceiling.

While he was out cold most likely from the shock I got him to a hospital to get the buckshot out of his nose and the girl to a different kind of hospital while there I found out her name was Daisy, Ian did get arrested in the hospital but because of a good lawyer or a kind judge or whatever reason he only got six months of probation, not easy probation he was working as road maintenance but it turned into a job after the six months.

Daisy however wasn’t so lucky she was in that hospital for five years before taking her own life, the hospital then shut down due to people finding out how much they were ill-treating their patients… I talked to Daisy about a year after me taking her to that hospital and she told me how grateful she was for me saving her life but I clearly didn’t and I’ve been living with that thought for a little shy of sixty years and will still be living with it for God knows how long.

Are you looking for a story where love grows naturally, one moment at a time? I’m a 24 year old male searching for another person to explore a slice-of-life romance filled with genuine connections, emotional depth, and a slow-burning spark.

Our characters could meet by chance or through shared routines, and over time, their bond evolves into something meaningful. The story would focus on their growth as individuals and as a couple, with plenty of room for lighthearted moments, heartfelt conversations, and emotional twists.

Whether your character is a free spirit, an ambitious dreamer, or someone still figuring it all out, there’s a place for them in this story. Let’s create a relationship that feels grounded, heartfelt, and memorable.

Plot ideas to set the stage:
	1.	The Barista and the Regular: One of us is a barista at a cozy coffee shop, while the other is a frequent customer who always orders the same thing. Through small interactions—sharing a laugh over a bad day, recommending a favorite book, or bonding over the perfect latte—their connection deepens into something neither expected.
	2.	The Bookstore Encounter: A chance meeting in a local bookstore sparks an unlikely friendship. Whether it’s arguing over the best authors or bonding over late-night book discussions, their relationship slowly turns into something more.
	3.	The Late-Night Study Sessions: Two students (or a student and a tutor) end up sharing the same table at a library or campus café during late-night study sessions. What starts as quiet companionship turns into meaningful conversations and a growing connection.

If any of these ideas resonate with you, or if you’d like to brainstorm a new one, feel free to reach out. Let’s create a story that’s warm, heartfelt, and filled with moments you won’t forget",1,1763644314.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False
1p22scx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTherapy/comments/1p22scx/5_tips_for_effective_exam_preparation/,5 Tips for Effective Exam Preparation,"Preparing for an exam is not a piece of cake. You have to absorb a large amount of information, deal with a certain stress level, and often work against the clock. Let’s have a look at some tips to prepare for your exams effectively.

# Identify your weaknesses.

This is the key to success. Only when you know where your weaknesses lie, can you work with them. Sometimes it helps to focus on things you would like to improve. A great strategy is to try to find something you’re good at. If you don’t feel confident when it comes to logical tasks, maybe your strong point lies in remembering things and putting different pieces of information together. Realizing this can become your starting point for planning out your exam preparation.

# Try not to be nervous before your exam.

Easier said than done, right? Exams and stress go together hand in hand. Try a different approach. Take the exam as a challenge. Be excited about showing your knowledge. You can’t avoid being not stressed out entirely, but this way you can at least minimize the stress impact. When you prepare for your exam, enjoy the learning process. Think about it as an opportunity to organize your knowledge.

# Make sure to have enough time for revision.

If it’s a difficult exam you have to study a lot for, make a plan. Write down a list of all the topics you have to study and of all the things that need to be done. Divide the topics of the exam into separate days. This way you can focus on the difficult stuff and manage to do more easier things in one day. In case something happens and you’re not able to follow your plan, you can change it. The important thing is to know what to focus on.

# Try not to learn things by heart.

Sometimes there are still areas you have to memorize by heart. This mostly applies to categories of some subjects. You have to know the categories so that you know where the facts belong to. These categories can be found in linguistics (e. g. types of clauses), biology or medicine (types of muscle tissue), or any other field. These categories can help you to organize your knowledge. If you don’t have to learn anything like that, try to understand the topic you are learning about in depth. Think about a way you can link the facts you learn together. It will pay off. If you have a deep understanding of the topic, the things you’ve learned will stay in your head.

# When studying, think about your well-being as well.

Get enough sleep. After getting plenty of rest, your brain will function more effectively. When you study for your exam, be comfortable. Make yourself some coffee, tea, or any other beverage you like. Use your favorite cup. Organize your desk so that there is not a clutter of things on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is everything you need (e. g. a dictionary or a highlighter). Also, be sure to take breaks. During these, stretch out so that your neck doesn’t go stiff. Don’t forget to eat regularly. Indulge yourself with a good and nutritious snack. You deserve it. You work hard. These things seem to be details, but they matter a lot. 

*Hopefully, you find these tips helpful. Good luck with your exams. Happy studying!*",1,1763644289.0,CollegeTherapy,0,1.0,False
1p22qwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weightlosstechniques/comments/1p22qwn/3500_calories_a_day_it_was_criminally_primitive/,"3,500 calories a day - It was criminally primitive to lose 60 lbs on office job but impossible with an intense physical job","I have only lost 27 lbs in last 4-5 months while working the physical job. Seriously !!! TwentySeven only ! I did gain some muscle mass that I can definitely see, though (those \*\*\*kers are heavy, so it's obviously skewing the scale number even if I dropped my pants size by almost 8)

  
I'm 6'4"", down from 280lbs to 253 lbs. My 6-pack weight is \~235 lbs (wide chest build). At 215, people stop to ask how many months I have to live (true story).

Some numbers from a Calorie Calculator that seem about right for me:

2,600 calories / day - sedantery job - maintenance diet (no gain/no loss)

3,500 calories / day - my current job - easy day  
4,000 calories / day - my current job - hard day

  
Yes. 4,000 calories a day is still just maintenance diet, as ridiculous as that number may look.

No, I can't take off a 1,000 calories on those days, as it's very dangerous. I tried, and survived without harm only by pure luck.

I've tried 2,500 calories on an easy day and it's borderline dizziness - lots of small mistakes, much slower reaction times. Very cranky, very hungry. Not social for more than 2 hours after breakfast.

I absolutely will not repeat 3,000 calorie diet on a hard day - might not survive another one of those. The legs stop working towards the end of the shift on 3,000 calories.

If you ever did one of those 16-hour whole-day hikes - it's like that - your legs/knees simply stop being able to carry you.



While every week the scale is still moving (only about a pound each week), it's pathetically slow. In past, I would have long lost my target weight after \~4 months. And I'm accounting for slower loss by the end, obviously.

With every weight loss I have done over decades, I make permanent adjustment to my diet and thus the time it takes to gain weight back is getting longer and longer - now actually approaching half a decade, which is the longest ever.

I don't eat pizza, drink just filtered water and home-made tea and coffee and basically cook all my food from raw ingredients.

While all my life I worked in an office setting, I've quit the corporate BS and have been working physically last 6 months. It's actually fantastic except for one thing - I can't restrict calorie intake like in an office because it's very dangerous.

In an office, it didn't matter I was starving and dizzy. Now it can kill me or seriously hurt - so I need to have snacks every 2.5 hours (home-made egg/bacon sandwiches and yogurts and cottage cheese) - I need lots of protein as the muscles are definitely sore afterwards. All the muscles - back, shoulders, arms, hamstrings, biceps, quads, glutes.

I was lucky I didn't break my neck 2 weeks ago when backing up and last week almost crushed my wrist because I was hungry, dizzy and yawning - unfocused. 



So, I can't use the fact that I am burning through the calorie like crazy (it's a fast-paced, fast-breathing exercise, basically - kinda like an elliptical - a whole-body exercise).

In the evenings, I don't even have energy to give my Husky a long walk - I barely walk her 90 minutes a day now (get up at 2am to walk her before work) , which I hate but at least in the morning/noon she gets half an hour, but evenings I am passing out and 15-20 minutes is most I can do.





I don't eat dinner on days I work. I may have few oranges a grapefruit and a banana in the evening, but no dinner. Often my last food is at 2pm and next meal is 4am. That's how I lose weight.",3,1763644185.0,Weightlosstechniques,0,1.0,False

Let me tell you about a situation, my situation. 

There's a living room in my house and it has a LOT of wall space and quite a lot of floor space. No TV (for private reasons), a marble fireplace that I don't care for but scarcely have the inclination to remove. Partly because it'll introduce even more floor and wall space, and I have too much. 

I've got a sofas on two of the walls, total of 2 sofas. I'm thinking of putting another sofa in there, total of 3 sofas, but it's only me and my husband so I don't know what good that would do us. I already have a superfluous coffee table in one other corner of the room, it is never used because there is nothing to put on it. I have put a giant rug in there, but even that seems to do nothing. 

Has anybody got any ideas?
We live near Swindon if that helps. 



My husband has suggested we just keep putting sofas in the room until it feels full. But there must surely be another solution. We can't just fill the room with sofas, but then I can't think of a better idea.

1p22hwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunheadprime/comments/1p22hwr/haunted_hills_part_2/,Haunted Hills - Part 2,"“Holy shit, someone was robbing graves!” Carrie yelled at me as soon as I got home the next day.

“What? How did you find out?”

“Scuttlebutt online. Some other night owls saw a person in there, and when they went to look this morning, they found freshly turned-over dirt. Wild, huh?”

“Kinda taking the Halloween thing a little too seriously?”

“Dude?! That’s what you have to say?”

“Gimmie two seconds, Carrie. I just walked in.”

“One, two,” she counted. “Dude! Grave robbers! In Haunted Hills!”

“When you say it like that, though, is it really surprising? That’s like saying cookies eaten by Cookie Monster.”

“Dude? Are you serious? You were right! Someone stole shit from graves! Take the win!”

The weight of it hit me. Someone was stealing from the graves. Holy shit. Who was doing it and why? “Jesus. What graves? They know who was involved?”

“I did some digging - forgive the pun - and it was a bunch of random ones.”

“Weird. I have to assume that if you steal from the dead, you’d plan ahead and pick your spots carefully. Random spots seem strange.”

“The councilwoman you mentioned last night? She’s quoted in the article about how the cemetery attracts a criminal element and all this nonsense.”

“Curious comment as she is ramping up an opposition to the place.”

“Right?”

“This woman is going to make me a goddamn booster for this haunted, fenceless cemetery, isn’t she?”

“Again with the fence?”

“It allows ghosts to roam freely in the neighborhood, Carrie. A true menace!”

Carrie rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if Councilwoman Chambers can turn public opinion around on it and award that Grosso guy the land, she’s going to make so much money.”

“Allegedly.”

“Allegedly,” Carrie echoed. “Isn’t that fucked up?”

“I wonder how Ray is taking this?”

“I bet he’s pissed.”

“Probably. I’m a little pissed, if I’m being honest, and I hate the damn place.”

I saw Crumbs finally making his way out of the room to greet me. He looked depressed, a suicidal Charlie Brown. I called him. He lazily trotted over and stretched for my pets. I gave Carrie a look.

“What’s up with him?”

“He’s been like that all day.”

“Is he bored? Maybe he needs to destroy something. Where’s his new stuffie?”

“He keeps hiding it.”

“What?” I said, laughing.

“Seriously. I found it buried under the pillows in bed this morning. I tossed it to him and went to do some things around the house. When I came back, I saw the doll’s little legs sticking out from the bottom of the pile of clothes you’ve yet to put away.”

“Weird. Wonder what’s up with him.”

“I dunno. Dogs are strange. Circling back to the growing pile of clothes. Where are we with them? Clean? Dirty? In-between?”

“Where’s the doll now?”

She sighed. “I don’t know. Why does it matter?”

“Do you ever remember Crumbs burying anything the entire time we’ve owned him?”

Carrie paused and gave the idea a once-over before shaking her head no. “Not that I can recall.”

“Why this doll then?”

“Maybe he realized it was unsettling, too.”

“I didn’t think you’d have such a vehement reaction to it.”

“What about our years together would make you think I’d love a tiny, realistic, creepy-looking doll?”

She had a point.

We chatted for a bit about our day, moving around the house as we did. As I went into our room, I saw the doll’s legs sticking out from the bottom of the laundry pile again. I yanked it out and shook my head.

“Hid it again, huh?” Carrie said.

“He’s barely touched it.” I turned to Crumbs, who had trailed directly behind Carrie. I held it up to him. “Hey, bud, want the doll?”

I tossed it at Crumbs, who scrambled away. The doll landed face-first onto the hardwood with a thud, cracking its face. Carrie laughed. “I told you. We all hate it. Go put it in the donation pile in the garage.”

So I did. I felt a slight tinge of guilt. Ray had obviously spent a lot of time on this, and it felt wrong to toss it into the garage with the other useless shit we refused to get rid of. I looked at the doll one more time—the crack running right down the middle of its face—and placed it into a box of Salvation Army donations. “Fare thee well, Dolly,” I said, turning back into the house.

Later that night, after Carrie and Crumbs left for the village of Nod, I did a deep dive into local politics. Ray’s suggestion of major corruption within the city had piqued my interest. I started exploring the connections between the developer and the city council and was surprised at what had been reported.

They weren’t hiding that they had a connection, but they kept insisting that everything was legitimate and legal. There was a transparent system in place, and other companies could also bid on the project. But it seemed the other companies in town had all decided not to bid at all. Suspicious at the very least.

This whole affair made me decide to look into the cemetery’s history. I knew little about it other than I hated it and it lacked fences. I quickly learned that the fence thing was because the original plot was a lot older than I’d previously thought. At that time, the place was so out of the way from the town that it wasn’t worth putting one up. Even as the town caught up to the location, nobody associated with it wanted to spend the money.

While that made sense, what struck me as odd was the place's lore. Legend says a coven of witches once gathered where the cemetery now exists. They’d been hunted down and killed by local church officials. Before being burned to death, one of them promised to “poison the well of souls of all who dwell here.”

Townsfolk took that to be the people involved with the witches’ deaths. However, as time has marched forward, the legend has changed. People now suggested that the witches meant no one who’d been laid to rest there would find peace. Their spirits would walk the Earth, forever lost in limbo between the waking world and the great beyond. I thought it all sounded like great fodder for a story, but that was all.

While I was reading and the clock flipped from PM to AM, I heard the squeak of hinges coming from somewhere in the house. I assumed it was just Crumbs making his nightly rounds, but when I didn’t hear the telltale CLIP CLIP CLIP on the tiles, I stood up to investigate. I saw that the door to the garage was ajar. We moved back and forth between the garage so often that it wasn’t uncommon to see.

But I had remembered shutting it. Maybe Carrie went out there to grab a seltzer from the fridge and forgot. But I’d just heard the creaking hinges. Someone had just opened it. I flipped on the kitchen light and looked around, but didn’t see anyone. A sweep of the garage yielded no results either. I was stumped.

I walked back inside and heard the shuffling of feet on the tile. Someone had to be in here. Maybe one of Councilwoman Chambers’s night thieves. I’d rather it be a flesh-and-blood intruder than something I couldn’t see. I could scare away a thief. A ghost, though?

This is exactly why I demanded a fence. Ghost containment 101.

I rushed around our house, checking all three rooms, but didn’t see anyone. I swallowed hard, although my mouth was dry. My heartbeat ticked up as if God were pressing down on the gas pedal. My body shivered, and I could feel a charge in the air. Once again, I heard soft footsteps moving behind me. I turned and didn’t see anything.

The growling nearly made me pass out.

Thank God I didn’t, though, because the growling wasn’t from a hidden demon. It was from Crumbs. He’d dragged his carcass up from his bed and found something he didn’t like in the shadows. I followed where he was looking, but saw nothing. I moved to him and patted his back. What should’ve felt silky smooth was coarse and pointed.

“What do you see, boy?”

I heard the rush of footsteps behind me, quickly followed by the creak of my front door opening. Crumbs barked, and I turned to see the door slowly moving. Inviting the outside world in.

“What the hell?”

I took a step outside. The night air chilled me as my bare feet touched the cold concrete of our small porch. I glanced around for anyone and didn’t see a soul. I shook my head and mumbled curses to myself.

“What’s going on?”

I nearly jumped out of my skin. It was Carrie. Crumbs’s barking must’ve woken her up. She stood in the living room in her oversized shirt and old shorts with both a confused look and crease lines from her pillow on her face.

“I heard someone knocking, or thought I did,” I lied. I didn’t want to worry her, and now didn’t seem like the time to explain everything. Confident nobody was here, I felt fine to follow Carrie to bed. I locked all the doors, said a prayer to whoever was listening, and kissed her forehead. “Your hair is a mess.”

“Come to bed, huh?”

“I am. Crumbs, you’re in charge.”

He hopped onto our couch and lay down, but his eyes never left the front door. He would not move until he was satisfied that things were safe. This actually helped relax me. He’d be our “Oh shit!” alarm if something happened. I walked over and gave him a pat on the head. “Good boy,” I whispered. He wagged his tail in appreciation.

Morning came, and things seemed settled. Crumbs had passed out on the couch and happily greeted us as we zombied out of the bedroom for coffee. Carrie asked about the door again. I told her I was reading all about the cemetery and might’ve freaked myself out. She said that was a dumb thing to have done, which I couldn’t argue - and to avoid reading scary shit before bed. I also decided I’d look into security systems for the house. The rest of the day went off without a hitch.

That evening, Ray was waiting for us at the corner. I saw him from down the street and took my earbuds out in anticipation. I also removed my headlamp to avoid any more comments. Carrie had instructed me to get some dirt on what was going on with the cemetery. I’d honor her request.

“Can you believe this bullshit?” Ray said, tossing Crumbs a small bit of a sandwich. “They’re trying to make this place look like a crime haven!”

“You think the developers are involved?”

“Developers and that witch Chambers. Thieves. Crooks. Liars, the lot of them,” he said, his voice becoming more irritated with each name hurled at his enemies. “Sorry, it just fries my ancient ass to a crisp that these assholes are gonna get away with it. Pardon my French, but the sailor in me comes out when my blood boils.”

“Ce n'est pas un problème,” I joked, my nightly DuoLingo training finally proving its worth. “I get it. You think they’re gonna do something else out there?”

“I guarantee it,” he said. “It’s why I’m setting up plans to catch them in the act.”

“Cameras?”

Ray nodded. “A magician doesn’t reveal his secrets. Just know that if it works, it’ll keep them out of here forever. Be a dead issue for the city.”

He started laughing, and I joined him. Not because I thought what he said was funny, but more because I really didn’t know what this man was capable of, and I wanted to stay on his good side. He’d been in the military and was clearly holding a grudge. How far would he go to keep the graveyard? To keep his family close?

We bullshitted a bit more before he suddenly acted as if he’d been struck by lightning. “Oh, I forgot something! Lemme go grab it,” he said, jogging up toward his garage.

Crumbs and I shared a look, and a simple understanding passed between us. Neither of us wanted to see another doll in Ray’s hands, but as he came bounding out of the garage, we both saw legs sticking out of his closed palm.

“Never gonna guess what I found outside my house,” he said, opening his hand. I saw the cracked face of the doll I had left in the garage. “Must’ve dropped it last night after he left. Found it outside my garage this morning. I patched up the crack on the face.”

My stomach dropped. It was like the ground beneath me dissolved, and I plunged into the Earth’s core. I could feel the heat from the magma. Crumbs must’ve felt it too. He growled at the doll and took a few cautious steps back. Ray looked confused.

“What’s going on, pooch?”

“He, uh, I think he might be afraid of it,” I said. “He kept burying it.”

Ray laughed. “Dogs are odd, huh? You sure you don’t want it, buddy?”

Crumbs growled. I translated. “I think he’s good, Ray. Sorry, he wasn’t more receptive.”

“First rule of toy making is to make what the kids - or pooches - will play with. I’ll put her back on my shelf.”

“Sorry again. I didn’t think a dog that I’ve seen eat poop would have such discerning taste.”

“Eh, it’s okay. Every rejection is a chance to learn what works and what doesn’t. I don’t hold it against you or the good boy there,” he said, reaching his hand down to pet Crumbs. Crumbs took a nervous step forward, sniffed his hand before giving Ray one small lick.

“I think all is forgiven,” I said.

“Good, good. Don’t want any bad blood from good people, er, dogs, too.”

“Want me to monitor the cemetery during the walk? If I see someone, maybe I’ll scare them away.”

“It’s not smart to enter a fence-less cemetery without permission first. They see it as a transgression,” Ray said. I kept waiting for the laugh, but it never came. However, I felt a bit vindicated about my fence stance.

Nodding, I regripped Crumb’s leash. “Then I’ll shout from a distance.”

I left not long after that. Ray had said he needed to finish up his project before midnight. I didn’t pry as to why that was because a little voice in my brain kept saying, “You don’t need to know what nefarious plans this old salt is up to.” I agreed with my cautious inner monologue.

Score one for little voice.

As I rounded the last corner of the cemetery, a fog had settled around us. This wasn’t uncommon, but it didn’t make it any less unsettling. Naturally, my thoughts drifted to the spirits and their supposed transgressions Ray had warned about. My skin prickled as the goosebumps migrated north up my spine. I re-tightened my grip on the leash.

“Crumbs, now would be an ideal time to finally open the pod bay doors and release the escape pods, huh? Let’s not stay out any longer than we have to.”

Crumbs caught the scent of something on the ground. He started snuffling the dirt and pulling me toward the cemetery. I stood firm. “Buddy, just shit on Brady’s lawn. He’s a dick, anyway.”

But Crumbs was stubborn. He kept yanking me into the street, toward the grass of the cemetery. I held firm. “Dude, work with me here.” He refused. He’d caught the scent of something and would not stop. “I’ll give you ten thousand snausages if you stop.”

He didn’t.

I gave him a little more leash to help him track the scent. I didn’t like standing in the middle of a foggy road at the best of times. Doing so outside a graveyard was another level altogether.

Crumbs sniffed and sneezed. He pulled his head up and went stock-still. His attention was laser-focused on something inside the cemetery. I followed his gaze, but in the brief time we’d been standing here, the fog had thickened like it had gained the “freshman fifteen.”

That’s when I remembered the headlamp in my pocket. I turned it on and peered into the fog. The light met the white wall and died on arrival. The light did nothing but invite jokes from old Navy guys. I thought about keeping it on, but when Crumbs started growling, I quickly flipped it off.

This time, when I yanked on the leash, Crumbs relented. Whatever he had been tracking had scared him so much that his bravado dropped. He was ready to be safely back inside our house. I gave one last cautious look into the cemetery. I expected to see nothing but the wall of clouds around me, but in the dim moonlight, I saw a figure walking in the distance.

“Oh shit,” I whispered.

It was a man, and he was moving from grave to grave about a hundred yards from me. He had something slung over his shoulder, but unless I had Inspector Gadget eyes, I’d never be able to make out what it was. I had no intention of interjecting myself into this equation any more than I already had. It was best to let the pros handle this. But since I didn’t think I’d be able to find an exorcist on such short notice, the cops would have to do.

“Crumbs, we’re going solo walk mode.”

I scooped him up in my arms, held him like a football, and did my best Saquon impression. While running, I couldn’t help but marvel at how bad the fog had gotten in the last few minutes. While it wasn’t unusual for this area to get foggy when the conditions were right, I couldn’t remember a time when it was this impenetrable.

Neither could Carrie, who had put her audiobook on pause and come to the window to look for me. As soon as I walked in the door, I could see the relief on her face. She eyed the headlamp in my hands and frowned.

“Why aren’t you wearing it?”

“Follow me,” I said frantically, placing Crumbs on the ground and stomping off towards the garage. Carrie followed behind me, confused but going with it. “You saw me put the doll in the garage yesterday, right?”

“Yes. Why?”

“It showed up at Ray’s house,” I said.

Carrie’s face went slack and pale. “No it didn’t.”

“Carrie, I saw it. Remember the other night when I said I thought I heard knocking? Well, I wasn’t being a hundred percent honest with you.”

“What are you talking about? Are you having an affair?”

“What? No. Please. You think another woman wants to put up with my issues?” I said, pointing at myself. She relented and nodded in agreement. “The other night, I heard the door to the garage open and footsteps walking around the house…then the front door opened and….”

“I’m sorry, what the fuck are you saying?”

“I think...I think that doll is possessed and walked out of the house.”

The shock on her face was instantaneous and deep. I could almost hear her brain popping. This is the kind of information that fundamentally tilts your worldview. Nothing is ever the same. She laughed nervously and then shook her head. “Are you saying the little dog toy doll walked out of our house all by itself? And you didn’t share this with me?”

“I know, but I didn’t want to scare you or have you think I was insane.”

“I’m scared now. Terrified, even.”

“I know I’m an ass,” I said. “Forgive me. Be mad tomorrow,” I said, pulling the donation box from the pile. The doll should’ve been inside. It wasn’t.

“Oh my God,” she said, her hand moving to her mouth. “This can’t be happening.”

“I know. But the other option is Ray broke in and took it back…which is also not ideal.”

“I feel lightheaded. I…I think I need to sit down,” she said, stumbling back. I dropped the box and caught her as her eyes fluttered closed and she passed out. I carried her to the couch and laid her down.

“Carrie, are you okay?”

Her eyes opened, and I was once again staring into those sparkling emeralds. She slowly sat up, her head still spinning. I grabbed her some water, and she downed it in an instant. I refilled it again. She downed that one too.

“Jesus Christ,” she finally said.

“If you know the man, we may need his help,” I said.

Carrie smiled, shook her head, and ran her hand through her hair. “What the hell is going on?”

“There’s more,” I said.

“Of course there is.”

“I saw someone in the fog. In the cemetery. I don’t think it’s a caretaker, either.”

“You think it’s another person trying to make the place look bad?”

“Maybe.”

“How did you see them with this fog?”

“Dumb luck,” I said.

“Why can’t we ever get dumb luck with lotto numbers instead?”

Crumbs started growling and took a few steps toward the front door. Carrie and I locked eyes, concern churning between our gazes. What was out there? The fur on his back was raised like a mohawked punk at CBGBs.

Somewhere in the fog, we heard Ray yelling. I couldn’t make out what he was saying, but he sounded distressed. I looked at the door and back at Carrie.

“I’ll call the cops,” Carrie said. Crumbs was snarling now, barking as if someone was trying to harm us. I’d never seen him this agitated.

“They’ll take forever with this fog,” I said, sighing and resigning myself to my fate. “I should go see if I can help.”

“I’d rather you not.”

“I’d rather not, too. But I couldn’t live with myself if I heard him in trouble, but let fear keep me from helping him. It’s dumb, I know, but….”

“It’s brave,” she relented. “It’s the right thing to do.”

“Hold Crumbs back, okay?”

She whistled, and it broke Crumb’s spell enough for him to sprint over to her. He was still anxious and on edge. He licked her face a few times before turning back to the door. I walked toward it, and he barked at me.

Carrie wiped away a tear. “He’s trying to get you to stay.”

“He’s a good boy,” I said. I hesitantly turned the handle of the front door and pulled it open just enough to look out. It was hard to see anything through the fog. Anything could be waiting out there for me. I shuttered.

Ray yelled again from somewhere inside the mist. I opened the door wide enough to head out and heard Carrie yell. I turned to see a Crumbs-shaped blur dart from her hands, sprint through my legs, and break for the foggy cemetery.

“Crumbs!”

Without thinking, I ran after him. I couldn’t let any harm come to my little dude. Crumbs was barking somewhere out there, but my vision was limited. I knew I had crossed into the cemetery because I was on slick grass and not pavement.

“Oh yes! It’s working!” Ray yelled somewhere in the distance. These weren’t distressed exclamations I thought I’d heard. He was thrilled about something.

Off to my left, I heard Crumbs growling. I turned on a dime and started running toward him. With my vision compromised by the pea soup, my foot caught the corner of a headstone, and I went flopping to the ground. I landed on my chest so hard that it pushed all the air out of my lungs. As I rolled over onto my back and sucked in air, my eyes caught something lying on the grave next to me.

It was one of Ray’s dolls.

He’d placed the doll on its back in front of the headstones. Its dead, glassy eyes staring up at the night sky. You could see the swirls of fog reflected back. Unlike the doll that he gave us, which he said was modeled after his daughter, this one looked older. Maybe it was his wife?

As my brain tried to process everything, I felt someone under me. I rolled off the grave to discover another doll. This one differed from the last two. I glanced at the plot next to me, and there was another, different doll. Same for the next. I had to assume he’d made one for every grave in this row of the cemetery.

Ray yelled what sounded like gibberish, and the fog instantly dissolved down this row of graves. It was as if God himself had cleared a path from on high. Well, God or his neighbor to the south. The rest of the fog remained on either side of me. I felt like an ancient Israelite passing through a parted Red Sea. I glanced down at the opposite end of the clearing and saw where this fog tunnel ended: Councilwoman Chamber’s big, blue house.

It couldn’t have been a coincidence.

In that moment, I clocked that several of the nearby graves all shared the same last name. It was a name I knew because I saw it on Ray’s mailbox every night we did our walk. These must’ve been where his people lay buried. All of his people. Like he had told me, some of these graves dated back to the town’s founding.

“Jesus Christ,” I muttered.

Ray’s voice broke through the fog again. More gibberish, but this time, when he stopped, the ground below me shook. The row of headstones down the clearing all began to tremble and fall over. As they did, wisps of a putrid-smelling green smoke emerged from the displaced soil and swirled in the air above the doll bodies.

The swirling, vile green stench formed a funnel and burrowed into each tiny figure’s chest, infusing the doll with this magical smoke. There was another rumble on the ground, and the fog around the now-exposed row of graves became so dense that I couldn’t see any of the porch lights from the surrounding houses.

That’s when the doll next to me sat up.

It wasn’t alone. All the dolls slowly sat up and looked around. I scuttled to the edge of the fog like a frightened crab, but these dolls paid me no mind. I wasn’t their target. They all stood, turned toward Councilwoman Chambers’s house, and began marching.

Crumbs came zooming out of the fog like a doll seeking rocket and lunged for one of the tiny figures as it passed by me. Before his teeth could sink into the felt, I yanked him out of the air and held on firm. He squirmed, but as I tightened my hold, he relaxed and licked at my face.

I stood, looked back toward my house, and was about to run when Ray emerged from the fog. He must not have seen me, as I had moved to the edge of the six-foot-high fog wall. Ray looked down at his little minions and smiled. He wiped his eyes, and I saw he was crying. He placed his hand on a fallen headstone and nodded.

“I won’t lose you again.”

This felt like a moment I wasn’t supposed to see.

When he looked up, we locked eyes. Shit. If he was surprised, he didn’t betray it. Instead, he nodded at me. “Your doll was my test. I needed to know it would work.”

I tried to respond, but no words formed. What do you even say to that?

“I never intended to harm you. Just needed to know if it was possible. When I found the doll in my driveway, my heart was so full. It was like Rose was back with me. If it worked for her, it could work for them all.”

Crumbs squirmed, and I struggled to hold him steady. The marching dolls were driving him wild. He felt the conflicting dog objectives of joyful play and ride-or-die protection pulling him in different directions. I whispered in his ear to relax him, but it had a limited effect. He was acting how I felt - manic.

Ray nodded at us. “The pooch knows - you protect your family at all costs. In this life and the next.”

I watched as the first few dolls crossed the street and entered Councilwoman Chambers’s yard. As they set foot on her grass, their little bodies ignited into mesmerizing marching green flames. They climbed onto her porch and set it ablaze.

Ray turned and watched the glow. “Protect them at all costs.”

I turned and ran. The fog was still dense around me, but the cleared path made the trek easier. I heard Ray laugh as I burst through the wall of fog at the edge of the street. Carrie was standing on the porch, her hand over her surprised, gaping mouth.

“Hurry,” she yelled.  It was all she could force out. Her mind was taking in several amazing things happening all around her. A horror-movie fog, a green-tinged fire eating away at a distant house, her husband and dog suddenly emerging from a graveyard like something was chasing them. Bad as that was, how much more would her brain break when I told her about the dolls?

Crumbs leapt from my arms and bolted right to Carrie. She scooped him up, and he coated her face with nervous licks. I ran to her, grabbed her arm, and dragged her toward the open door.

“What’s going on?” she asked, her mind reeling.

“You don’t want to know.”

“Should we call the fire department?”

“Might want to call those priests you mentioned earlier….”

About ten minutes later, the fog and the Councilwoman’s house burned away. Firemen were spraying down the last dying embers, while paramedics and police spoke with a few neighbors. I could see Councilwoman Chambers standing near one of the “More Homes Now” signs outside her now burnt husk of a house. Both she and her husband looked dazed.

The only neighbors who hadn’t come outside to watch the fire were us and Ray.

The police initially suspected arson, but they never found conclusive evidence to support that story. I knew the truth, but I wasn’t coming forward to say anything. Not only would they think I was insane, they’d probably try to pin the whole thing on me.

In the weeks since, the city’s desire to move the cemetery had been - for lack of a better phrase - put on the back burner. They seem to have found other issues to focus on. Councilwoman Chambers has dedicated herself to informing her constituents about fire safety.

The lady never let a crisis go to waste.

I still see Ray on our nightly walks. We make small talk, and he always seems to have a treat for Crumbs. We’ve never brought up what happened that night. If I had to bet, I would imagine we’ll never discuss it. Did I have a billion questions? Of course. Every time I saw him, I had to stop myself from blurting out something about black magic or doll making or who those people were to him. But what good would come from burrowing down on the fantastic? Some things are better left unsaid.

What’s the old expression? Fences make good neighbors.",1,1763643506.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

“Ray’s retired. He doesn’t have to worry about keeping banker’s hours anymore. If he wants to stay up all night and bang hookers, he can,” my wife said, as she flitted around the house, decorating for Halloween. “What do you think of my eyeball wreath? Pretty cool looking, huh? Get it? Looking.”

I shook my head. “Very clever.”

“I am very clever, thank you. Why are you keeping tabs on his nightly activities?”

“Keeping tabs makes it seem sinister. It’s not. But when you take walks at night, the landscape looks pretty dull. You tend to notice people working in their lit-up open garages. Especially if it’s a nightly activity.”

“The landscape is pretty dull? We live across from a cemetery. You’re not looking to see if any ‘nightly activity’ is happening over there?” she asked, hanging a four-foot-long mummified corpse in the doorway.

The graveyard in question was one of the major downsides to renting a house in this neighborhood. It had been built nearly a hundred years ago, when the town was nothing but a sleepy village. But as the town grew, it caught up with this final resting place and kept growing. Now, there were rumors that some shady developers had been trying to snatch up the lot, move the graves, and build new homes in its place.

I’ve seen Poltergeist—we didn’t need those kinds of problems.

“One, you know I’m not a fan of the cemetery.”

“Because of the lack of fences around it, I know, I know,” Carrie said, mocking me while hanging up a garland of severed limbs. “Such a strange thing to be concerned about.”

“Ghosts can escape if they aren’t contained, Carrie. Simple cemetery facts. Haunting 101. Everyone knows this.”

“Uh huh.”

“Two, I don’t want to look over there and discover that something actually is happening.”

“I dunno, might be kinda exciting.”

“No, it wouldn’t. Ignorance is bliss, darling.”

“So you’d rather focus your attention on a tinkering old man?”

“What if he’s building a bomb?”

“What if?” she said, sticking bloody fingerprint molds onto the window.

“When Crumbs and I save the neighborhood, I expect a written apology.”

“Crumbs is a dog.”

“A smart dog, ain’t that right, buddy?” I said, trying to call him away from my wife. Crumbs lives in my wife’s shadow. He’s her ride or die. He raised his eyes, looked at me, and lowered them again. I shook my head in disbelief. “I saved your life, Crumbs. She didn’t even want a dog.”

“Don’t fill his head with lies. He needs to stay sharp to be effective during your nightly investigations,” she said with a wink. “Assuming he’s the lead on the case?”

“Hilarious,” I said. “But seriously, what do you think he’s up to every night?”

“Worshipping the devil,” Carrie said. “What else?”

“I’m being serious.” She gave me a look. “Serious-like, anyway.”

“Have you asked him?”

“No, why would I talk to him?”

She rolled her eyes and slapped her hip out of frustration. “Why would you not? If you’re curious why he’s in there and you see each other every night, just ask what’s up.”

I thought about it. Logically, it made sense. “Nah. I’d rather snoop instead.”

She plucked a skull from the decoration tote, held it in her hand, and spoke to it with a faux English accent. “Alas, poor Yorick, why are men?”

“Why are men what?”

“That was the whole question,” she said, playfully sticking her tongue out at me. “Should I put the skull on a pike in the yard or on the coffee table?”

“Outside, definitely. Since we might actually see heads on pikes sooner rather than later, better get used to seeing them now.”

“Won’t the ghosts be insulted?”

“They’ll haunt you, not me. If you can deal with that, I say go for it.”

“Crumbs will protect me from any threat.”

“Not if it interferes with his nap time,” I said, looking at the snoozing dog.

Insulted, Crumbs raised his lazy bones from his dog bed, strolled in between us, and plopped down. Carrie laughed. “See! He knows where the genuine danger is.”

I shook my head at the dog. “I walk you every night, man. A little solidarity, huh?”

He huffed and lay down at Carrie’s feet. I hated to admit he looked cute, but he did.

Little jerk.

Later that night, as I prepared Crumbs for his nightly walk, Carrie came over to me and handed me a headlamp. “Please wear this. I don’t want you or Crumbs getting hit by a car.”

“It makes me look weird.”

“Better than being dead.”

“Is it?”

“What does it matter? You don’t talk to anyone anyway. Unless tonight is the night you finally speak with Ray.”

I gave her a look, kissed her cheek, and took the leash from her hand. “I’ll be back soon.”

“Be safe. I don’t want to be forced back into the dating pool. I did my time already.”

“And you’d miss me, right?” I asked, fishing for a compliment.

“Who else would open all my stuck jars?” she said, rubbing my biceps.

I hit a bodybuilder flex, which made her giggle, and headed out for our walk. I decided she was right. I never speak to anyone, so why not throw on the headlamp? The world in front of me lit up like a supernova. Crumbs looked up at me, and I swear to God, I could feel his judgment.

“Come on, bud. Let’s get going before the ghouls come out of their graves.”

We started our nightly ritual. Crumbs, always excited, slightly pulled me forward. He had to smell all the fresh smells and add a few of his own. I glanced out to my left and saw the polished headstones reflecting the moonlight. I shuttered.

While I hated the cemetery, I couldn’t avoid it either. It was the defining feature of this neighborhood. I’d heard people call this section of town Haunted Hills, which I hated for two reasons: 1) the idea that it was haunted, and 2) there were no hills.

Undeserved alliteration was a crime against the language.

Our strolls walked the boundaries of the cemetery because it was about a mile around and was (not surprisingly) quiet. That was enough of a nightly stroll to keep Crumbs and me in decent shape. We could’ve gone another route, but it would have taken me along a busier road, and sometimes Crumbs forgot how little he was and would lunge at loud cars as they rumbled past. He was trying to defend me, which I appreciated, but I didn’t need the leash flying from my hand and him ending up a spot on the road.

Usually, I listen to an audiobook, but I’d forgotten to charge my earbuds. I had to deal with the noises of the nocturnal world. I didn’t mind too much. A change of pace every once in a while is a good thing.

I spied Ray’s open garage looming at the end of the street, the yellow light bleeding out into the dark. I really didn’t know anything about Ray other than that he was older and worked on something in his garage every night. Beyond that, he was a total stranger. For all I knew, he could be a creature from another realm. I thought back to my grandparents—they knew everyone in their neighborhood. They held block parties every summer. Game nights and potlucks once a month. Had a real sense of community.

Gun to Crumbs’s head, I couldn’t tell you either of my immediate neighbors’ names.

As his place got closer, I felt the anxiety of having conversations with people when all I really wanted to do was zone out. With earbuds in, I could pretend not to hear someone call out and have plausible deniability. But now? If Ray wanted to chat, as old folks are wont to do, I’d be stuck.

That said, Ray never left his garage. Every time I’d walk by, I’d clock him hunched over his workbench, fiddling with something. Why should tonight be any different? If the man was knee deep in some mystery project, who was I to pry?

But as fate would have it, Ray took a smoke break just as we reached his driveway. We glanced and nodded at each other in the way you do while passing strangers on the street - acknowledge but not engage - and I assumed that was it. It wasn’t.

“Trying to guide planes in with that light?” he asked, pointing at my lamp.

I silently cursed Carrie. “Someone has to bring the boys in safely,” I responded.

Ray gave me a polite chuckle. “What kinda dog is that?”

I stopped, silently sighed to myself, and put my mask on. “Crumbs is a mutt, but we think he’s mostly Havanese.”

“He like treats?”

“He lives for them.”

“Hold on a second, I have something for him,” Ray said, heading back into the garage to grab something.

I glanced down at Crumbs, who was happily wagging his tail as if he knew a treat was coming. This dog has ESP with food. Ray returned, cigarette hanging at the corner of his lip, and walked down to the end of his drive. I realized this was the first time I’d seen the man up close.

He was thickset and stout, with ropey arms. He had faded tattoos on his forearms that looked nautical - maybe he’d been in the Navy? His hair was thinning, but it was still black as the night. He had hooded gray eyes, but there was still a spark in them. He looked like he had been a real shitkicker in his younger years, but mellowed with age. As he approached, I noticed he had a piece of hamburger in his hand.

“He okay to get scraps? I can’t eat this whole thing, and it’ll just go to waste.”

Carrie was adamant that I not give Crumbs scraps. She listed all the reasons, and they were valid. But when he turns his cute little face up at you…well…the boy eats. You’d think my loose rules about human food would buy more affection from him. It didn’t.

“Just don’t tell my wife and we’re good,” I said.

“My wife was the same way,” Ray said, laughing so hard it morphed into a smoker’s cough. Without missing a beat, he summoned a green and yellow loogie and spat it on the ground. It landed with a wet splat. I had to hold Crumbs in place so he wouldn’t run over to smell it or worse. Dogs can be gross like that.

“Here you go, pooch!’ Ray said, dropping the small piece of hamburger onto the ground. Crumbs ate it all in one bite. Ray laughed. “Must’ve been hungry.”

“He needs his protein for his nightly walks.”

“I was gonna say, I see you both almost every night. You look lost in your own world most of the time.”

“Sorry. Most nights, I have headphones in. Not purposely being rude.”

“No worries. Most of the time I’m at the bench.”

“Oh,” I said, realizing we were going into full conversation mode now. Carrie would be so proud. “What are you working on?”

“A few dolls for the ‘Save the Graves’ fundraiser,” he said, pointing to the political sign speared into his lawn. “I was a toy-maker for years, and I still make some from time to time.”

“Wow, did you work for one of the big companies or…”

“No, no, no. Those guys turn out cheap plastic crap made overseas. I ran a made-to-order toy business. All natural products, all handmade.”

“That’s incredible. What was your biggest seller?”

“Dolls. Every kid wants one at some point. I love making them, too. Used to model the little girl ones after my kiddo, Rose.”

“That’s sweet. I’m sure she loves that.”

“She did,” he said, his voice catching. “I lost her a few years ago. Cancer.”

“Jesus, Ray. I’m sorry.”

It was still a soft spot for him, but he waved me off and braved through. “Life has a way of sticking it in and breaking it off, doesn’t it?”

I laughed. “Yes, sir.”

“Best part of the job, though, was seeing how excited they were when they got them. Warms my heart. These days, it’s not lost on me that even though my Rose is gone, her spirit lives on in all those dolls.”

Ray looked past me and into the cemetery. I wasn’t Einstein, but I was able to add two and two. His wife and daughter were probably residents in the cemetery. Made his advocacy to keep it around clear.

Wanting to change gears, I nodded at his yard sign. “You really think that development group is going to buy it?”

“I hope not, but I think they’re in the works,” he said. “The developer, Grosso, is related to Councilwoman Chambers,” he said.

“Really?”

“Oh yeah. As thick as thieves, too. She’s complained about it for a while, and now that she was elected, she’s trying to do something about it. Chambers has got enough gumption and no scruples to see it done, too. She lives in the big blue house on the other side of the graveyard.”

“That would’ve explained all the political yard signs last fall.”

“Word is she’s rigged it so her friend gets a plum, no-bid deal. Gonna print money for him, and you know she’s gonna get kickbacks. Whole council is filled with crooks.”

“That all seems super illegal.”

“Seems that way because it is. They’re a bunch of criminals. Want to disturb the dead for what? Cram a few more houses in here? They’re stealing the spirit from Haunted Hills,” he said, exasperated.

“Literally, if they’re successful,” I joked.

Ray smiled. “Suppose so. Sorry if I get a little worked up. Losing them once was hard enough. I don’t need to lose them again,” he said, pointing across the street into the graveyard. “She just moved here a few years ago. My people have been here since the founding. Damn near my entire family line is in there.” He paused and shook his head. “I know it may be weird to want to keep a cemetery near you, but the idea of defiling these folks all in the name of more overpriced homes,” he said, swallowing the string of curse words he wanted to say.

“No explanation necessary. I get it.”

“You want a flyer for the event? Maybe bid on a few items to support the cause?”

“Sure,” I said. “Thanks.”

“Hold on one second,” he said as he dashed back into his garage.

I looked down at Crumbs. His tail was wagging, and he had ketchup on his face. “Bud, wipe that up before Mom sees evidence of our crimes, huh?” As usual, Crumbs ignored me.

Ray came down and handed me a flyer. He also had a small doll in his hand. “I dunno if he likes little toys or whatever, but I have this stuffed plushie doll I made. He can have it if he wants.”

It was a little girl doll with long black hair and sparkling blue eyes. She was dressed in a purple jumper with a smiling sun on the front. She was about twelve inches tall and hand-stitched. It was, without a doubt, the nicest dog toy I’d ever seen.

“Ray, wow, that’s really nice. Thank you. He goes crazy for stuffies.”

“Just takin’ up space in the garage. Rather see it get used than not, ya know?” he said. “Hey, poochie, want the doll?” He tossed the doll up, and Crumbs snapped into action. Even though he was old, he loved stuffies.

He jumped and snagged it out of the air. He landed with a humpf and violently shook the doll. Ray cackled and slapped his knee. “Everyone loves Rose!”

“Testament to your parenting, Ray,” I said, adding, “and to your craftsmanship. Crumbs usually destroys these things within minutes.”

“He’ll have a hard time breaking that one. Top quality material,” he said, petting Crumbs. “I should get back to work. Don’t be afraid to say hi, huh? I’m always out here.”

“Same,” I said, sticking out my hand to shake. His grip was firm. “Have a good one.”

“I’ll try,” he said, turning to walk back to his garage. From over his shoulder, he called out, “Put a bid on one of those prizes. Let’s keep this neighborhood unique, huh?”

“Will do!”

We continued our walk. As we turned the second corner, Crumbs suddenly spat out the doll. He curled behind me, tangling the leash up in my legs. I stepped out from the pretzel, reached down, and grabbed the doll. I held it out for him to retake it, but he balked.

“Okay then,” I said, putting the doll in my zip-up pocket. Half of her body hung out, and it looked like she was going for a ride in a human-shaped car. I wondered what would be more embarrassing, the dolly in my pocket or the headlamp on my head?

I heard someone dragging a garbage can out to the corner in front of me. For a fleeting second, I was worried I’d forgotten it was garbage night, but then I realized it was two days early. When I glanced over at where the sound came from, I saw Councilwoman Chambers standing at the curb.

She was diminutive in stature, but she cast a long shadow. She was put together well and always on…even while dragging a can of trash out to the corner. The air of aristocracy surrounded her - a bubble that only wealth creates.

We locked eyes, and she waved at me. I’d never seen this woman nor interacted with her, so I had to assume this was all for Crumbs’s benefit. When she started walking over, making baby-talk noises, I knew it was. Or hoped it was. Can’t have every politician in our lives with pudding for brains.

“Oh, what a handsome boy! Aren’t you? Aren’t you? What’s your name, handsome boy?” she said to the dog, as if Crumbs would stand up and tell her.

“Crumbs,” I said.

“Aww, why did they name you after a mess? You’re not a mess, are you?”

“Sometimes,” I said. Crumbs, who greeted everyone that came within a mile of him, stayed cowed behind my legs. Councilwoman Chambers came walking towards him, violating my personal space, to pet him. He was not having it. I felt the leash tighten against my legs as he inched away. “I’d be careful. He’s weird sometimes with strangers,” I lied.

She eyed the doll in my pocket, and her entire demeanor changed. “Oh my, did that man give you one of his nasty little ragdolls? He is such a thorn in my side.”

“Why’s that?” I said, playing dumb.

“Let me ask you this, young man. Do you enjoy looking out at headstones every day?”

“I mean, it’s not the worst thing. I’d like to see a fence around the cemetery. Hedges, maybe?”

“Wouldn’t you rather see half a dozen smiling families living their best lives there instead?”

“Would it increase traffic and noise?”

Her fake smile straightened. “Did you know what the police call this cemetery? ‘Junkie Land’. Because of all the illegal activity that goes on during the witching hours.”

“I’ve never seen anyone in there after dark,” I said.

“You have to have heard the voices, right? All hours of the night - especially when the weather turns. Fog rolls in, the criminals gather and plot.”

I almost laughed at the suggestion. Councilwoman Chambers apparently had a turn-of-the-19th-century view of how crime worked. She probably still believed a Gangs of New York-style brawl between the Dead Rabbits and the Confederation of American Natives was bound to break out.

“Here,” she said, reaching into her pocket and handing over a brochure, “give this a once-over and then tell me you’re against my plan.”

“Thanks. I will,” I said. “We should get going. I don’t want to be here when the drug lords roll through.”

I laughed.

She didn’t.

When I got home, Carrie saw the doll in my pocket and was confused. I told her all about my adventures, and she started cackling. “You had quite the little walk tonight, huh? A lot of peopling for an introvert.”

“Now I know how swing voters feel,” I said, tossing the brochure in the trash.

She plucked the doll from my pocket and looked it over. Her reaction was a stir-fry of emotions ranging from disgust to admiration. “If nothing else, he knows how to make a doll. This is high quality.”

“Yeah. Modeled it after his daughter.”

“That’s sweet. I feel bad letting Crumbs de-stuff this thing,” she said, tossing the toy down. But as the doll tumbled toward Crumbs, the dog side-stepped it and crawled to his bed. Carrie looked at me, and I shrugged.

“It was a long walk.”

“I guess so,” she said. “I can’t believe you actually spoke with a neighbor. That’s growth.”

“He was nice. Said to say hi when I pass by again.”

“Are you going to?”

I shrugged. “Probably. Maybe not every time, but I’ll give him a nod if I see him.”

Carrie rolled her eyes. I filled her in on the whole graveyard brouhaha and handed her the flier. She looked it over and made an impressed noise. “I thought you hated the cemetery.”

“Oh, I do. But I hate corporate greed and corruption more. The ghosts have, so far, stayed away from us. But if rich folks are planning to squeeze the last drop out of those headstones, they’ll be a splinter under our nails forever. In this fight, I’m ‘Team Dead Ghouls’ over their living counterparts.”

“Wonder who Ray has buried over there?”

“Said his whole family line. But I think the sore spot is his wife and daughter. Impression I got, anyway.”

“I can’t imagine seeing your dead family dug up and moved because someone bought the land. Seems wrong, right?”

“It does,” I agreed.

“We should bid on something. Support the cause.”

“If nothing else, maybe it’ll get them to add a fence,” I said reluctantly. Going from hating the cemetery to supporting it in the span of an evening felt like emotional whiplash.

“Fences can’t hold back the ghosts,” Carrie said. “Only a young priest and an old priest can.”

“That’s demons, and let’s hope there aren’t any over there, huh?”

“Should we try to contact one?” Carrie asked, her eyebrows raised. I gave her a stern look, and she broke into a smile. “Kidding,” she added.

“You’ve already guilted me into supporting a potentially haunted cemetery. Don’t push your luck with demon jokes,” I said, shaking my head. “Life comes at you fast, huh?”

“Don’t you mean…deaaaaaaaath,” Carrie said, dragging out the word like she was a ghost.

I laughed. “I swear to God.”

“You love me.”

“In theory,” I said. She playfully smacked my ass and gave me her “mean” look for all of two seconds before laughing. “Such a poker face, Carrie.”

“I’m a lover, not a fighter,” she said, wrapping her arms around my waist and pulling me close. “What about you?”

“Check, please,” I said. She laughed again, and we went on our merry way.

At around three that night, Crumbs hopped onto the bed and made his way up to my pillows. He wedged his little body between Carrie and me and the wall of pillows we slept with. Annoyed, I got up to pee. I’d readjust our sleeping arrangements after.

I walked out of the bedroom when something outside the front window caught my attention. There was a glow from a light across the street in the cemetery. There weren’t any streetlights on our road, nor were there any in the cemetery.

At first, I thought my brain might still have been waking up. I gave myself a light slap on the face and realized I was fully functional. That light was out there.

Putting my piss on hold, I peeked between the curtains to get a closer look. Sure enough, there seemed to be someone walking through the graves holding a camping lantern. I watched the orange flame dance in the dark and felt a chill race up my spine. Maybe Councilwoman Chambers had been right about late-night rendezvous?

Whoever was traipsing around the graves was holding something other than a lantern. I couldn’t make out at first, but once it clicked, it made me concerned. It was a shovel. There were only two reasons someone would walk through a cemetery with a shovel: depositing or withdrawing. This didn’t seem like a deposit. Here I thought grave robbing died out around the time Jack the Ripper haunted London’s dark alleys.

“Babe, what are you doing?” asked a sleepy Carrie.

“There’s someone in the cemetery,” I said.

“Mourning?”

“No, potentially stealing.”

“What?”

“Come look,” I said, waving her over.

Carrie yawned and slowly made her way over to the window. I held back the curtains, and she looked out. After a beat, she turned to me. “Is this a joke? There’s no one out there.”

“What?”

“It’s too late for jokes, and I have an early meeting. I’m going back to bed before Crumbs spreads out,” she said, sleepily patting my shoulder. “You come too.”

She disappeared into the room, but I wasn’t ready to let this go. I peered back out at the cemetery. I didn’t see my thief. I thought maybe they’d hidden behind the large oak, but no one ever emerged.

“Fuck a duck,” I mumbled and turned toward the bathroom. Sitting on the ground behind me was the doll Ray had given Crumbs. It almost gave me a heart attack. I was worried for a fleeting moment that I might piss myself. My creep radar was already going off. I didn’t need to add any more blips to the screen.

The doll was leaning against the couch, its glassy, dead eyes staring up at the ceiling. The slight smile looked sinister in the dim light. In the morning, this would just be a dog toy Crumbs carried around like it was his work briefcase. But now? Now it looked like it might start moving.

I walked over to it and nudged it with my foot. It fell flat on its back and stayed still. I felt relief wash over me. I was still safe. I headed to the bathroom and left the doll alone. Before I left, I looked down and muttered, “We’re good people, doll. No haunting, okay?”

Ever notice how some people walk into a room and immediately shift the energy without saying a word? It’s a weird mix of presence, posture, and perception. I’ve seen this everywhere, especially in high-pressure environments like tech meetings in SF, job interviews, or even dating. What’s strange is that the loudest person isn’t usually the one in control. It’s the one who feels most centered. It’s not magic, it’s science, psychology, and subtle signals. But TikTok and IG will have you believe it’s just “acting mysterious” or “mirror their body language.” No. That’s surface-level nonsense.

This post is for anyone who wants real tools to flip social power dynamicsquietly. Tools backed by research, tested in real life, and explained simply from the best books, podcasts, psych studies, and AI tools I’ve found. After years observing confident leaders, therapists, body language experts, and high-status behavior in everything from campus panels to dating psychology, I realized these patterns are learnable.

Silence isn’t weakness when it’s intentional. Here’s how to make it powerful.

1. Hold your gaze 1.5 seconds longer than feels natural  

Not in a creepy way. The key is to be deliberate, not reactive. According to Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy’s work on presence, what reads as “intuition” is often our brain picking up micro-behaviors like eye contact timing and blink rates. High-status people don't dart their eyes around nervously. They scan slowly and make others feel seen. Practice doing this in low-stakes places, like ordering coffee or during Zoom calls. You’ll be shocked how people start to pay more attention to you.

2. Master “active stillness”  

Stillness signals restraint. Neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky found in his primate hierarchy studies that dominant individuals move less and blink slower. Why? Because anxious people fidget. Most of us try to fill silences with useless gestures. Instead, anchor your feet, lower your shoulders, and slow your movements. Breath slower. What feels “awkward” to you actually looks grounded and calm to others. Try this when sitting in meetings: still hands, relaxed jaw, subtle nods onlywatch how people start deferring to you more.

3. Lower your pitchby speaking less  

Voice pitch gets attention, but silence earns respect. Studies from the UC Santa Barbara Communication Lab found that speaking less in group settings can project more authorityif your timing is right. When you pause before speaking, you trigger people’s anticipation. And when you pause after speaking, you trigger their reflection. Combine both. Try the 3-second pause rule: 1 second before speaking, 2 seconds after finishing your point. Bonus: People are 35% more likely to remember what you said. Silence frames your words like gold.

4. Learn from social predators, not social climbers  

Powerful silence is learned best from those who don’t need to prove anything. One of the best breakdowns on non-verbal dominance I’ve found is in the book \_What Every BODY Is Saying\_ by ex-FBI agent Joe Navarro. He explains how confidence leaks out through feet position, shoulder angles, lip compression, and more. One key insight: the most dominant people don’t signal dominance. They act like they already have it. They don’t posture, they occupy. Study animals, elite athletes, and even CEOs in interviews. They aren’t hyperactive. They are precise.

5. Build a daily learning habit around power signals  

Yes, it sounds weird. But understanding human behavior is a skill. And just like hitting the gym, it compounds over time. Start building a 10-min daily learning habit that focuses on high-level social psychology, leadership communication, and dominance cues. Start by subscribing to podcasts like:

    1. Hidden Brain (NPR)  

    Hosted by cognitive scientist Shankar Vedantam, this podcast dives into the unseen forces that shape behavior. One great episode, “The Halo Effect,” breaks down why quiet confidence often earns more long-term trust than charisma. Mind-blowing research made practical.

    2. Modern Wisdom by Chris Williamson  

    Once a reality TV guy, now asking pointed questions to Navy SEALs, psychologists, billionaires and researchers. You’ll find incredibly sharp conversations on social cues, mental models, and behavioral economics. His episode with Robert Greene (author of \_The 48 Laws of Power\_) is basically a masterclass in silent influence.

6. Read this if you want to DRASTICALLY change how others see you  

    \_The Laws of Human Nature\_ by Robert Greene  

    This book will make you question everything you think you know about social power. Greene is known for dissecting human behavior through history, psychology, and strategy. He draws profiles from historical leaders, psychopaths, and revolutionaries to reveal how power works beneath the surface. It’s deep, dark, and painfully accurate. This is the BEST book I’ve ever read on mastering social dynamics without sounding rehearsed. I actually had to pause every 5 pages just to digest how much it wrecked my assumptions. 10/10.

7. Train your mind with smart tech, not doomscrolling  

    Try Deepstash  

    This app curates bite-sized ideas from books and thinkers. It’s great if you want to train your brain to focus on high-level insights in just a few minutes a day. Instead of scrolling IG, read 5 power tips from Seneca or Naval Ravikant. It’s low-effort, high-reward. Use it when you’re waiting in line or commuting.

8. Replace TikTok advice with adaptive learning  

    BeFreed: great tool if you want to be smarter effortlessly. It’s a personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It connects the top knowledge sources from books, research, expert talks, and real-world case studies and turns them into podcast episodes that actually fit into your life. You can chat with it and it builds a personalized and adaptive learning plan based on your unique goals. 

    What I love most: I picked a host with a calm, smoky voice. It feels like getting coached by someone who’s been around. BeFreed even remembers what I’ve listened to, builds a custom learning path over time, and gives me a journaling section that logs my key takeaways daily. It helps me internalize what I learn using flashcards powered by AI. You can pick how deep you wanna go10, 20, or 40-min deep dives. It’s made learning feel like a habit, not a task.  

    Bonus: It already has most of the books and insights I mentioned in this post. You can literally search “power dynamics,” “non-verbal confidence,” or “Robert Greene” and it’ll build a learning plan around that for you. A 1% improvement every day adds up. Replacing 10 minutes of scroll time for learning? That changes everything in a year.

9. This YouTube channel changed how I stand, sit, and lead  

    Charisma on Command  

    If you haven’t watched this yet, you’re sleeping on social power. They break down behavior tactics used by everyone from Obama to Rihanna. The video on “Why Villains Are More Charismatic Than Heroes” taught me more about power presence than any traditional leadership course. It’s digestible, fun, and actually actionable.

10. Slow > loud. Sincere > charming. Present > preplanned.  

    The biggest cheat code I’ve learned? Silent power isn’t about performing. It’s about removing the noise. People trust calm energy. They’re drawn to those who don’t need approval. You don’t have to change your voice or wear different clothes. You just need to carry yourself like your presence alone is enough. And that starts from the inside.",1,1763643271.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

I’m writing this thread hoping someone out there who’s like me has gone through the same problem.","Sorry for the weird title, it feels right in my primary language lol, anyway  
Here is my story.

Since childhood, I’ve had a tendency to overthink anything that feels “odd or negative.” You could call it rumination, whether it’s people’s emotions, behavior, strange events, or basically anything. I kept doing this until I was 29 years old (last october), and it became extreme around age 25.

This behavior affected every aspect of my life, socially, and even in my work (ofc, when I still had an offline job, that was the reason I chose to resign, i just couldn’t focus)

Earlier this month, I started trying to focus on good things. At first, I was confused and even had the weird thought, “What does focusing on good things even mean?” Now it’s November 20th, and I feel very confident that I’ve learned how to do it.

Here’s how I apply this idea of “focusing on good things.”

Let’s say I just woke up feeling down. What do I do?  
I ask myself, What would make me feel good right now? If the answer is food, then I ask, What food makes me feel good and is low-carb? (Im on keto)  
Okay, I eat that food. Then what? I’m currently unemployed, but I have freelance gigs and a YouTube project I should manage. I don’t feel motivated yet. So again, I ask, What would make me feel good right now?  
Maybe scrolling some funny content or playing my favorite game. But then I worry, what about productivity?

This is where “focusing on good things” actually helps my mood. Of course I play my favorite game. And no, I’m not doing anything productive yet. But it feels so good, like the depression and anxiety disappear for a while.  
And when my mood improves, I suddenly can be productive. Ta da here I am being productive.

Another scenario:  
Let’s say I’m annoyed by a stupid neighbor, angry about political news, or mad at my past self. Anything that makes me irritated. Again, I ask, What would make me feel good right now?  
It doesn’t matter if it’s just drinking coffee or lying down for a bit. Once my mood improves, I stop feeling irritated or angry, and I can focus on what’s important today.

Do you see my point?  
It’s like shifting my focus, redirecting myself toward something that actually feels good.

Apparently, I read somewhere that this is what healthy people do. Healthy people don’t ruminate, they just dismiss the overthinking.

It’s crazy that I only started doing this at 29.

I’m not trying to make it sound like this is some amazing breakthrough that makes me super productive or improves every area of my life. I still procrastinate and keep some bad habits. But at least it feels amazing. like being a kid again. Remember how, as a kid, you could easily (easy as im comparing it to my adult version) shift to something that felt good, even when that current moment weren’t great or enjoyable? That feeling is coming back, wohoooo!

However, as most people know, visiting and living with people are often two different things. 

On Great’s property it was no different, but there was also a set of generational rules that we were getting a crash course in. The fact that we now graced every single news cycle at the top and bottom of the hour did little to please the woman who was a grandmother in name only. When you aren't invited somewhere, it doesn't matter how many times you've been invited, you're intruding, we invaded her peace, and her grief as she tried to heal. 

 Her sour disposition had caused her own family to abandon her years ago.. The fading farm house with its chipping paint, dilapidated outbuildings, along with the dried up lake, the busted dam  and overgrown garden showed how quickly heaven could turn to hell following the death of a loved one. To ease her pain, Barbara, or Great as we called her, became a collector of things. Useful or broken, it did not matter she held onto it. How she was able to close her eyes and recall where the most obscure item was, is something that today I still envy. 

She loved collecting stories the most, and I must say Barbara was very effective at disarming someone with her sweet Southern charm. Decades of practice had taught Barbara to not miss any opening and she was able to rub elbows with some very influential people of our times. It was with her help that Brenna and I were able to go undercover in the Society of the White Rose, a posh upscale Atlanta society that catered to the Hollywood refugees. Whether they were fleeing the fires or the taxes it made no matter how, they still ended up in The Hollywood of the South, or as the locals called it Atlanta.

In the rolling hills of Georgia where hillbilly and Hollywood intersect, money mixed with poverty side by side led to the exploitation of some of the most vulnerable in Georgia's society. The poor men living in poverty that were just looking to survive were being locked up while rich men in luxury cars invaded the neighborhoods of the lower class. After all, they only wanted the dope out of their neighborhood, not out of their reach. So, when the young dealers were locked up and the money confiscated another opportunity presented itself.   

In their absence and having bills to pay the struggling, now single moms turned to pick up extra shifts and had billion-dollar corporations nickel and diming her before the Devil came knocking, wearing his suit and tie. They always paid the most for the first time, it was supposed to be special, a way for the lady to catch up on bills, and have some room to breathe. In the end though the money would be her noose, just another innocent villain in a rich man's crime driven by boredom.   

For the longest time, the White Rose went unchecked. After all, the upper levels of any civilization have felt entitled to prey on the poorest since the beginning of time. It wasn't until they made the mistake of targeting middle class families that public opinion turned against them. Even then for enough money, people turned a blind eye, witnesses got amnesia, victims became the villains, and the villains became the victims. Their manufactured honor and media blitz was just another smear campaign against those who could not afford to hand a blank check to a PR Firm to have their name cleared in the eyes of the public court. 

When they targeted a member of Barbara's church though the tides turned, and a generation of pissed off geriatrics called in any IOU from every questionable person they ever encountered, and that’s where I came into the picture.

I remember it all these years later. You see, life often hands you forks in the road and paths to go down, and certain events help shape that journey. For me this was a defining moment and it all started over a sandwich. Seriously a simple sandwich, two pieces of bread that lacked any meat in between and thus by the USDA standards of the time it was not even truly a sandwich, but it led me to where I am now. Writing these words down for the second time in my life and wishing for a chance to do it all again. 

When my phone rang I was down in South MS, and my grandmother had just made some of her famous pimento cheese when my cell phone rang. Seeing as how I was about to eat I almost ignored it, but something in my gut told me to pick up the phone. While I braced for an automated response about my car's extended warranty, I tapped the green button and brought the phone to my ear. 

Instead of the harsh, forced phonics of a speak and spell demon, I was greeted with the soft southern twang of an elderly woman as I finished speaking the word “Hello.”  into the phone.

“Yes, my name is Barbara, and I am looking for Bastion. My grandson, Shawn, gave me this number, and told me to reach out as he might be looking for work.” she replied effortlessly. “The two of them met at the VA sometime ago, Can he still be reached at this number?” The end of the line fell silent as she waited on a response.  

There was only one Shawn I knew from the VA, an EOD tech who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq. As an Airborne Infantry Soldier myself, he and I were able to form a natural friendship as we got to know each other. He was one of the only people at the time who knew I was planning to become an undercover journalist.

 A conversation that took place during small groups as we looked toward the future.  The grippy sock vacation that forced our introduction came following a suicide attempt as my battles with PTSD, and alcholism spiraled downward. When my then long-term girlfriend Eva, a good looking redheaded paramedic told me she fell in love with a coworker half her age she made two mistakes. One she brought him with her to tell me and then they both mocked me to my face. 

The rage unleashed that night showed me how close a woman dances with death when she toys with a man's emotions.The jacked up SUV they pulled up in  was owned by his father. He came out of the truck wielding a mouth that had been sharpened in years worth of Call of Duty chats, and a body that matched. The fire and brimstone he promised as he walked toward me was instead met with the harsh aroma of the smelling salts his coworkers used to revive him. They laughed as he came to, his face scrunched up like a toddler that had just soiled his diaper. The end results of that encounter allowed them both to rate their coworkers skills in the back of a moving ambulance. While I got a chance to take in the sights and smells of the county jail. 

Two misdemeanor charges were the intervention of a nameless veteran, our unspoken recognition of each other from the Veteran Affairs campus and his downgrading the charges a much needed helping hand. Still, I would never be able to own a gun again, but once I made bail it wouldn’t matter. Misdemeanor or felony,  what was the difference?

Even now that was the lowest point of my life.  Made even colder by the fact she went off to play house with a boy in a booster seat at the same time I had to bury my mom. It was two days till I could see a judge and bond out using only my signature. 

Three days later I buried my mom, Carol at Eastlawn United Methodist church in a small but intimate funeral attended by close family and friends.  The cancer that took her was a genetic defect shared by a large portion of the town's population. Off the top of my head, I can think of at least ten different people from the church who had cancer. They all fought the same battle but the results were always skewed.

 Death always won and with that thought in mind I said my goodbyes and headed to The Point. My mom was dead and my relationship was a failure. It had been nine months, three days and fourteen hours, but the beer I cracked open that night was the sweetest most mouth watering Blue Moon of my life. All the flavors mixed with the subtle hint of orange as my entire body sighed in relief. Nine months I held the addiction at bay. 

The welcome comfort of the alcohol chased away the harsh bitterness of the Oleander tea. The petals felt smooth and waxy against my teeth as I swallowed the whole flower. The leaves were gritty and burned.  I knew the plant was poisonous, but lacked a complete understanding of how it would work. So I ate it all and went to war with myself. 

My body revolted as the leaves worked their way down into my stomach.  Mother nature worked in tandem with thousands of years of evolutionary response to force me to throw up the toxic combination. My body fought against my mind as I gritted my teeth. The burn that was spreading to my heart caused me to double over in pain. Weakening me to try and make me give up with my fight. The pills turned to powder as I chased them uninhibited in how much I drank because tomorrow wouldn’t exist. 

When I felt I had consumed enough meaning I had nothing left to drink, and no more pills to swallow.  I laid my head back onto the cold soft sand and looked up at the full moon. The second of that month, I followed its path through the sky that night, and watched as it slowly faded into darkness. 

 I woke up three days later in ICU where I found out Bridge Guy, the local homeless man who kept the bridge on Bayou Cossette clean had called an ambulance for me. He was out of his territory and happened to be searching for cans when he came upon me unconscious aspirating on my own vomit. Instead of a funeral, and a twenty one gun salute, I got a thirty day stay at the VA inpatient ward.

   I had only been out for a few weeks at that time and I remember being excited. The future looked bright and it seemed like my new found brother was looking out for me. Our vow to help one another avoid becoming a statistic included throwing each other's name into a hat for jobs we thought the other might enjoy.         

“This is him, How has Shawn been? Still silently chewing his arm at night to escape Grendel?” I asked with a laugh. I grabbed my sandwich and headed out to my Oak tree. I called it mine, because after hurricane Katrina I pulled it back upright with my car and tied it up on three sides, nursing it back to health. My Uncle thought it was a waste at the time, but to me it was the last remaining tree my grandfather planted. I named her Charlie, and to this day I have never told anyone her name. But twenty years after the storm she was a beautiful majestic oak with a branch span that covered a large portion of the back yard.

 My sanctuary in uncertain times I sat down in a broken but familiar chair adjusting my weight instinctively to aid its now handicapped position. The cackle that greeted me from the other end of the phone and her reply cemented a brief but tumultuous relationship that was responsible for my success later in life. 

“You think for a man who defused bombs for a living he would be able to spot a walking timebomb before he put a ring on it.” A gentle laugh followed indicating that the time for formalities had closed and there was business to discuss. 

“I believe you said something about work. Is this a remote position or something that will require travel?”  That was always the most important part of any job position for me, the ability to change locations at a moment's notice. Something I was conditioned to do from a young age as the son of a Navy Chief. The formidable years of my own adult life in the military reinforced that as normal behavior. However, once I was out of the service the desire to pick up and leave was seen as a major personality flaw, and made finding a woman who could thrive in that chaos hard.

My most recent failure with Eva left me with a burning desire to be anywhere but Pascagoula, and I recall praying that if this job was meant to be it would take me away from that town. The sigh of relief I let out was so audible she was able to pick it up on her end of the phone. She didn’t even acknowledge the momentary interruption as she continued speaking.

“You’ll have to travel and the job might be physically dangerous. You’ll have room and board here, plus all your meals will be covered and 1500 a month for expenses in USD. The employment time is open ended at the moment but upon completion you’ll be paid the total amount of 15 bitcoins. If something should happen to that market we will default to paying you in gold. Roughly twenty two troy pounds paid out in a mixture of bars, coins, and other bullion.” She paused before continuing, “ I won't go over any other details on the phone. However, just for taking the trip and signing a non-disclosure agreement will pay you 5k dollars should you decline the position.”  

Gobsmacked would be an understatement to how I was feeling at that moment. The rush I felt as I comprehended her words and the anxiety they brought had me reaching for my weed pen as I considered a response. 

“How are you related to Shawn, again?” I remember asking her as I stalled for time to think. Had she said anyone else's name I would have already hung up the phone, but I paused curious to see where this would go.

 “I’m not really related to him.” Barbara began. “His father sold my husband some apple pie moon shine in Kentucky. He was a garbage man for the Dixie mafia who brewed some of the best bootleg liquor, and Frank met him while he was doing pipefitter work out there in early ‘73.” I knew the rest of the story but I waited on her to confirm it. The silence seemed to last forever even though it was less than thirty seconds. 

“Shawn's daddy was a true Irishman and had a love for explosives, liquor, and bees in that order. Before too long his daddy, Patrick was trading Frank his moonshine and mead in exchange for the extra pipe that Frank had leftover from some of his jobs. The copper pipe he would bend and fashion for his stills, whereas the steel pipe and caps he would use to fashion crude bombs and make random household repairs.” Her soothing tone told me she was not only remembering the story, but that she was truly there in this moment. She continued her story uninterrupted and hardly pausing. A skill I would later learn she developed because she was often talking and never listening. At that moment though I didn’t know any better and I listened as her story approached its climax. 

“Now if Patrick had a blind spot, it would have been where his wife was concerned. Debbie had ivory skin, gorgeous blue eyes, and freckles that dotted her face in all the right spots. Even as a straight woman in the 1980’s I found myself attracted to her. That was the pull of her personality, her dimples would grab your attention and her smile would draw you in and capture your soul to where she was all you could focus on.”  Barbara paused, unable to continue. I gave her a moment.

Having seen Shawn's mom in photographs I could understand the attraction that she was talking about. Recalling the aged photograph he carried onto the psych floor. He had nothing else on him but the blue paper gown of a man at rock bottom, and the comforting warmth of hospital issued grippy socks.

 The VA staff on the floor and the four man escort of hospital cops that flanked him made an exception to the policy of no outside items for that photograph. None of them were willing to confront the broad shoulder former bomb tech. The remains of a suicidal bender fueled with copious amounts of cocaine magnified his blood shot eyes as he surveyed his new surroundings. 

 I remember sizing him up as he entered. The hoe dust that covered his exposed arms and face was  courtesy of the strippers he bought with the last of his savings. The effects of which made him shimmer like some temu twilight character as the herpes of the craft world made this imposing man look like some Bourbon St caricature.    

The road rash on his face where the cop slammed him on the ground moments before an epic cannonball off of the Hard Rock Casino parking deck in Biloxi was dried and flaky.  With his coked out determination to go out in style his need for fame made him stand on top of the four feet high wall. The Neon lights reflecting down on the street below, he yanked his pants down to his ankles and in the words of my generation, his desperate attempt for normalcy, and his final prayer to the divine  he uttered the sacred words of our times DICKS OUT FOR HARAMBE!!!! The sound of his name echoing down to the busy street of highway 90 caused his casino hoping followers to respond in mass. Shouts of dicks outs and Harambe greeted Shawn and he paused his final test with gravity to enjoy the show. 

This gave the Biloxi PD officer time to grab Shawn and get him secured. Having been looking for a quiet place to fill a gatorade bottle the officer didn’t even have time to put his own dick up. The blurred picture of which made the National News. Word of Harambe’s phallic intervention spread across the internet and donations to gorilla sanctuaries  went up 2000 percent. The offending snort I made at remembering my friend's misfortune jarred Barbara back to the conversation. Overlooking a laugh that I was sure would terminate the interview at that time she continued.                   

“Well Patrick worked the night shift at the mines in Kentucky, and one evening the section he was working in had collapsed halfway down the shaft. Nothing major but the company sent them home,which was a rare event in those days.” She paused and I heard her take a sip of water before continuing. 

“Patrick never carried his house keys on him because Debbie was usually awake with the coffee and breakfast going when he got home. Shawn was only six months old at the time and just then sleeping through the night. Not wanting to wake him, Patrick jumped up on the trash can to tap on the glass and wake up a sleeping Debbie whose bed was positioned right next to the window.

 Not wanting to risk getting shot, Patrick took his time climbing on top of the trash can as he braced himself against the trailer. Careful to not slip and fall he stood up, and the first thing he heard was Shawn crying in the next room over. That was when his eyes focused on the crack in the blind and he saw Debbie riding their next-door neighbor.” she said. “Her head thrown back in ecstasy, Patrick would watch the love of his life defile their marriage bed.  He learned a hard lesson that night on how easy Debbie was. Patrick was loyal to a fault and married to a woman who allowed a  simple smile to  grant an invitation between her thighs.” The disapproval of Debbie's action was apparent in her voice. 

“Patrick called us drunk from the bar, slurring his words and repeating the phrase “He trusted her.” It was a wound that cut deep and had us leaving our farm in Fayetteville to go and check on him. We had just turned into his neighborhood in Kentucky when the explosion cracked our windshield. The Bridge over troubled waters was playing on the radio as I sat there in a daze, my hands grasping my ears from the blast. I watched Frank run inside, his volunteer fire fighter jacket offering limited protection as the flames began to engulf the trailer.  I never prayed harder than at that moment when he came running outside carrying the limp body of an infant.” Her voice began to crack as she went on.

“Debbie, and Dallas, her lover, were both killed in the initial explosion. I watched my husband run back into that trailer twice more. A screaming three year old was brought out first, followed by a caged bird. He ran despite his age as he helped the last survivor come out of the back bathroom. She was wearing nothing but a towel and her hair was dripping wet as she came through the window. The three year old was shouting in a high pitched panicked voice. HURRY JACKIE.” Barbara said her breathing was deep and she was open with her tears as she continued. 

 “Frank sat her down on the ground and focused his attention on the lifeless infant. I watched in silent horror as he worked. The motions were muscle memory for a man who took his family's safety so seriously. My eyes peeked through my hands, and the tears were streaming down my face.” Barbara said. 

“Frank's hands were those of a pipefitter. The muscles of his tan hands stood out in stark contrast against the delicate skin of the small child.  I watched as Frank used two fingers performing CPR with tears streaming down his face. It took twenty minutes for the first responders to make it on scene, when they made it over to where Frank was kneeling on the ground it took three full grown men to break him away from his efforts.” Barbara paused and I remember hearing her rustling for something on her side of the phone.  

The onions in my grandma’s pimento cheese had caused my eyes to water. I don't even know if she put onions in them, but that was my excuse because at the time it didn’t matter how sad the story was. A man wasn’t allowed to cry. I recall having to use the back of my shirt at the time  to dry them while I listened to her clear her nose. She continued, her tone changing as the hard part of her story was coming to a close.

“The official cause of the explosion was an innocent gas leak with no malicious intent. The young infant was a canary in the coal mine, his small stature causing him to pass sometime in the night. Patrick and Shawn came to live with us, and things went along as normal for years. 

Till one night, deep in a fresh batch of Jolly Rancher moonshine, Patrick confessed to Frank that he caused the gas leak. A makeshift timer caused the fatal spark, and any evidence was burned away. Neither of the two men saw Shawn walking up. The darkness and crackle of the fire concealed his movements, Frank said later the rage on his face as he watched Shawn stare down his father leveling the 410/22 rifle combo was something he had never seen before.”  She stopped right there leaving the rest unsaid and waited on my response.

Patrick, his own father, was the first-person Shawn ever killed. Our first night together at the Biloxi VA, I asked him about the picture, and his response caused me to look up from my medicine cup full of pills. “Even whores have sons who love them.” He threw back his pills, swallowing them all in one go, crushed his water cup and disappeared for two days. 

As the only two combat arms guys locked up in a VA psych ward, we spent a lot of time talking. The stories we shared in group highlighted a foreign war that he and I knew little about. The complex health care system cared not only for the War fighters, but also the wounds caused to the support personnel. 

The VA calls it MST or military sexual trauma. It’s a clinical way of saying the word rape. When he and I went to fight, our enemies were dressed as civilians. For them though, their demons often wore the same uniform. 

He and I retreated to the caged-in patio that overlooked the courtyard, giving them their space to heal. I thought it was the Seroquel talking, but it turns out he wasn’t full of shit. Great, his fairy godmother really did exist, and she was offering me a job. If everything he said was true, then the first offer was the only offer. If I declined, I would simply disappear, the only NDA’s she dealt in were permanent and would cause my birth certificate to become a historical document.

I was on the verge of declining her offer when Mrs. Susie’s car drove by. She was late delivering the newspaper that day, and I walked around to the front yard to get it. I asked Barbara for a minute to think while I unrolled the newspaper. The headline instantly made me know I would take the job as my eyes were in disbelief.  

There was my ex-girlfriend Eva and her fucking partner on the front page of The Sun Herald. The headline in big bold font.

 **Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Mississippi**

Fuck this town, I thought at the time as I skimmed the article. It turns out the paramedic team that saved me were my ex-girlfriend Eva and her new found beau. They made the front page for doing their job. Nevermind the fact, they were awarding her for playing the hero in a situation she caused. Our breakup was one of the reasons I tried to kill myself in the first place. Damn, the sex was amazing but the loyalty was lacking. Fuck this town and fuck her was the thoughts going through my head at the time. 

“I can be there Monday if you could email me your address.”  I remembered responding as I threw the paper in the trash can, walking back to the oak tree. We ended the call there and I said a silent thank you to my friend Shawn. 

I told him I wanted to become an undercover journalist, maybe write a book one day. He laughed and told me I should have become a SEAL instead of a paratrooper. With them, securing a publisher was their final evolution of Hell week. I might as well stay with what I knew, and that’s what he helped me accomplish... I wanted to be a writer, but I became something better instead.

A Killer for hire. 

I look down at the confession as it begins to take shape, and I need a break. Not only because my hand hurts but because the death of my wife has started to creep in and penetrate the walls, I had put up in my own mind to protect myself from the inevitable break that is to come when the shock wears off. 

So, for now, my thoughts are my own, and I go to the happier times of my life, the ones that meant the most. I feel I must tell this story in a manner that makes it complete to me, and so for the more intimate parts, it will only be here, told out loud in a quiet whisper in the confines of my cell. A place I can retreat to and be the man I truly was, I can’t break character for the outside world, they always demand a sacrifice, and to them I am Frankenstein’s Monster.

 I won’t get rid of that stigma, it gave the men I had hunted something to fear, their own personal boogie man. I only wish I had the ability to show whoever might find my confession that I am not a monster, but I was once a broken man, and with the support of my family and that woman the world will know as Great they let me heal on that farm in Georgia and took my life in several directions at once.

Here are my questions: Has anyone else gotten sick for days on the starter dose (2.5) and had success avoiding sickness at lower dose? How effective have doses of 1.5-2 been for you?

1p21yzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1p21yzv/how_to_manage_nausea_on_wegovy_or_mounjaro/,How To Manage Nausea on Wegovy or Mounjaro,"One of the most common questions people in Northern Ireland ask when starting **Wegovy** or **Mounjaro** is:  
*“Is the nausea normal, and how do I deal with it?”*

Short answer:  
Aye, it’s normal. And yes, you can manage it.

These injections slow your digestion, calm hunger signals, and keep food sitting in your stomach longer, brilliant for portion control, but a wee bit rough at the start.

Here’s the full NI-specific guide to handling nausea without derailing your progress.



# 1. Start slow and don’t rush the dose

Wegovy and Mounjaro are designed to increase gradually.  
If you jump too fast, your stomach will throw the head up.

**Golden rule:**  
If nausea hits hard after a dose increase, stay on your current dose for an extra week or two.

Plenty of people in NI do this, and it makes a world of difference.



# 2. Eat wee meals, not big ones

Large meals will overwhelm your system.  
Smaller, steady meals keep nausea way down.

Try:

• half your usual portion  
• 4–5 mini meals  
• simple foods early in the day  
• avoid “heavy dinners” late at night

Your stomach is basically running at half-speed, give it half the workload.



# 3. Ginger is your best mate

Proper NI fix this one.

Try:

• ginger tea  
• ginger biscuits  
• ginger chews  
• ginger ale (the Irish one hits better)

Ginger settles the stomach almost instantly for most people.



# 4. Avoid greasy or very fatty foods

These meds slow digestion.  
Grease slows it even more.  
Combine both? Instant regret.

Foods that commonly trigger nausea:

• deep-fried anything  
• heavy takeaways  
• creamy sauces  
• cheese-loaded meals  
• very spicy curries

Not forever, just the first few weeks.



# 5. Cold foods are easier on the stomach

Loads of patients notice chilled food goes down easier.

Try:

• cold chicken  
• smoothies  
• overnight oats  
• apples  
• cold pasta  
• yoghurt pots

The colder the food, the calmer the stomach.



# 6. Stay hydrated, but sip, don’t chug

Being dehydrated makes nausea worse.  
But so does downing a full bottle at once.

Do:

• steady small sips  
• water with lemon  
• diluted cordial  
• electrolyte sachets if needed

Don’t:

• neck a litre at once  
• drink fizzy drinks on an empty stomach



# 7. Avoid lying down right after eating

It slows digestion even further.  
A 10–15 minute walk after eating genuinely helps.

Even a slow shuffle to the end of the street and back works.



# 8. Try peppermint

Peppermint is the second-best nausea fix (after ginger).  
Tea, tablets, or the classic polos, whatever works.

Peppermint relaxes the stomach muscles and eases bloating.



# 9. Watch out for caffeine overload

Caffeine on jabs = nausea for loads of people.

Either:

• reduce coffee  
• switch to milder blends  
• try half-caff  
• or have it *after* food, never before



# 10. The “BLT rule” (Bite, Listen, Trust)

A tiny hack:

**Take a bite.**  
**Wait 1–2 minutes.**  
**Listen to your stomach.**  
**Trust what it tells you.**

If your stomach goes “nope”, don’t push.  
If it stays calm, continue slowly.

People on GLP-1s often forget their hunger signals change, so you have to relearn them.



# 11. If nausea hits suddenly, here’s the quick fix list

NI-tested, patient-approved:

• a ginger biscuit  
• sipping iced water  
• a wee peppermint sweet  
• lying on your left side  
• cold air (step outside)  
• a plain cracker  
• a slow 5-minute walk  
• avoiding screens for a moment

Nine times out of ten, it settles within minutes.



# 12. When does the nausea usually ease off?

Typical NI experience:

• Week 1–2: most common  
• Week 3-4: settles for most  
• Dose increases: symptoms may return briefly  
• Long-term: almost everyone adapts

Your stomach catches up.  
Your brain catches up.  
Your appetite steadying is the whole point.

Nausea usually disappears once the body adjusts.



# 13. When should you get help?

You *should* talk to a clinician if you have:

• repeated vomiting  
• severe abdominal pain  
• no food tolerance for 48 hours  
• dehydration signs  
• dizziness that doesn’t ease

These medications are safe, but like anything medical, oversight matters.



# Final thoughts

Wegovy and Mounjaro nausea isn’t a sign something’s wrong, it’s a sign your body is adapting to a major shift in appetite and digestion.

Most people in NI get through the nausea phase quickly with:

• smaller meals  
• ginger  
• cold foods  
• slow dose increases  
• and listening to their stomach, not fighting it

Once it settles, the results speak for themselves.",1,1763641968.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

Going from “guy who reads too much” to “guy who wrote something” is wild. I hope some of you enjoy it. I also hope some of you cry or yell in anger. Both, if you can swing it.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

CHAPTER ONE

“I hope you know what you’re doing.”

The corgi didn’t move a muscle, the only evidence that it wasn't a statue were a determined “Boof” sound and flinch of its snout.

Its gaze remained locked on the sliding door of the van, reminding Ethan of regal knights from old fairy tales. Its bark, if it could even be called a bark, seemed weak compared to the slobbery, menacing growls coming from outside, making the van feel like a to-go tray filled with a tasty, greasy dinner.

And yet, the small dog looked entirely unbothered.

“Well, alright then,” Ethan grunted as he swung the door open, hoping to catch the wolves off guard.

Before the door was even half way open, the corgi launched itself out of the van like a cannon, vaulting over the closest of the three wolves and landing on the ground facing away from all of them. Ethan for some reason felt afraid for the dog’s safety, as though the dog had been a close friend for years.

Don’t expose your back to wolves!

He was about to yell for the corgi to turn around when it moved. But it didn’t turn around; it started… twerking? Dancing? Whatever it was doing required a lot of butt and hip movement.

All three of the wolves stopped growling, their heads turned to the side like they were working on a particularly difficult puzzle. Ethan could only stare, his mouth open.

After a few moments of silence, he threw his hands up in frustration.

“… the hell?!”

The corgi glanced back with a look on its face that said “Come on man, I can’t keep this up forever.” Anger and confusion vanished as Ethan realized the dog was purposefully providing a distraction.

Chambering a round in his hand gun, he crept out of the van.

The closest wolf, whose fur had a distinct red tinge to it, didn’t even notice as he stopped beside it. Aiming his pistol at the back of the wolf’s head, execution style, Ethan took a deep breath. At the bottom of his exhale he pulled the trigger.

The explosion sent his ears ringing as the wolf collapsed like a bag of bricks, catching a glimpse of whatever bits of skull and brain matter blew out the front before forcing his eyes away.

Growling resumed as the remaining two wolves lost all interest in the corgi and turned toward Ethan, ready to pounce like a dog ready to play, but not nearly as adorable.

The closest of the two, this one with blue fur, launched itself at Ethan. Mid-air, it gathered a faint blue light into its claw. On instinct, Ethan lifted his hand and fired three quick shots, the weight of the wolf barreling into him right as he fired. A slight cold pain numbed his left arm, which probably wasn’t a good sign. The wolf wasn’t moving, which was a better sign.

Dizzy from the ringing in his ears, Ethan decided to hold off on any more shooting if he could help it. Better to conserve his ammo, anyway.

What had happened to the last wolf?

Ethan strained his ears from beneath the weight of the freshly killed wolf, but everything sounded muffled. He couldn’t hear anything other than his own racing heartbeat.

Rolling to the side and shoving the wolf off him, he jumped to his feet, almost falling over as the dizziness settled. With a shake of his head, he looked around. A green furred wolf lay on the ground beside the passenger door of the van, its spine folded backwards. Lying on top of the wolf was the corgi, who looked like it had belly flopped onto the wolf’s back and decided that was a comfortable place to relax.

The yet-unnamed corgi angled its head toward Ethan with a smug look on its face, like Spongebob when he realized Squidward liked Krabby Patties.

“Yes, yes,” Ethan said, breathing out a sigh of relief. “You’re a good girl.”

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

CHAPTER TWO

“There’s nothing quite like a good poop.”

A new man walked out of the rest area bathroom. That’s how he felt anyway — a proverbial weight lifted from his shoulders. Or abdomen, in this case. Ethan reached his hands up to the sky, giving his back a much needed stretch, then headed back to his van.

The particular rest area where Ethan stopped was as good a place as any to get some sleep. He’d driven about ten hours through Texas and was somehow *still* in Texas. Neither New Mexico or Arizona were going to be much better. It didn’t seem to matter, though, as he felt more excited and lighter than he had in a long time.

Not just because of his successful trip to the bathroom.

Friends and family had begun to notice the slump in his shoulders, the bags under his eyes, and general lack of relentless enthusiasm they were used to seeing.

You’d think that someone who’d dreamt his whole life of being in the military would finally find where he belonged; a place where he’d thrive. Turned out four years in the Army had been more than enough for him. Two years would have been the sweet spot. For now, at his wife’s suggestion, Ethan intended on making the most of his newfound freedom.

Plans for the upcoming week filled his head as he climbed into the back of the van, eager to set up his sleep system. With fuel top offs, bathroom breaks, and food stops, he expected to make it to California in two days, right on time for his 30th birthday. He’d hang out with his family and get in as much home cooked food as he could before he set out on his adventure.

What kind of adventure? A backpacking trip across the Pacific Crest Trail. Twenty-six hundred miles of California, Oregon, and Washington wilderness were calling his name, a hike he figured would take him about five months.

*‘That’s a long hike,’* they’d said. 

*‘No way! For real? A couple thousand miles is a long hike? Thanks mom, thanks dad. I never would have realized,’* he’d replied, except not out loud. Only in his head. Whatever, it was fine.

Sarcasm could be therapeutic, sometimes.

Eventually everyone realized he wasn’t joking and started asking real questions. Yes, Rebecca is on board. No, it was her idea in the first place. Yes, they could afford it. No, she and Jack would be staying with her folks. It was as though they assumed zero planning and forethought had been put into the trip.

Ugh, parents. He was a grown man!

To be fair, he understood the skepticism. The most difficult part of this whole trip was that he’d be away from his son for so long. Being in the Army, he was used to not seeing his wife, but his son was still young. It was hard to miss the toddler years.

But they both agreed he needed this. Ethan wasn’t dumb, he knew Rebecca needed it too. He’d become progressively more difficult to live with, so this was as much a break for her as it was for him. Besides, they’d video chat as often as possible and he could fly back to spend time with them as often as needed.

So… in theory, Ethan wasn’t in too much of a hurry.

After four years of being told what to do, he was eager to take his time and go at his own pace. They’d saved up enough money over the past year to not need to work for a while, his recent deployment making it much easier. It was amazing what he could do with a year of tax free income.

Before starting the hike, Ethan looked forward to spending time with his nephews. They were *huge* Pokémon nerds, especially the trading cards. He and his brother, their dad, had grown up playing and collecting them, so he was technically a nerd too.

Ethan had promised he’d battle them in the trading card game, even though he hadn’t owned any cards since the prior Christmas when he’d sent them all to the boys as a gift. After a while, he kinda wished he had kept his cards from when he was a kid. Oh well. Most of the fun came from opening the packs anyway; the excitement that came from the potential in each unopened pack could be addicting.

The plan was to stop at a comic book store the following day to buy a starter deck and maybe a box of booster packs. He’d settle for a Target if he couldn’t find one nearby. Again, technically, he wasn’t in a rush.

Plenty-o-time.

Not quite tired enough to fall asleep, Ethan unrolled his sleeping bag, then opened the tough box in the back of the van. Inside were a few dozen MREs (Meal Ready to Eat) that he had “tactically acquired” from the training room before signing out of his unit on his last day in the Army. They were intended to be used on the hike, but he didn’t feel like stopping for food out in the middle of Texas.

MREs. Bleh.

Still a better option than vending machine food, though he may have been willing to part with a stack of quarters if any of the machines had a Reese’s Snack Cake. Those things were basically crack cocaine.

Ethan grabbed two of the MREs, looking over the names.

One was “Pork Sausage Patty, Maple Flavored”. He mentally gagged as he tossed it back in the tough box. That MRE was the bane of his existence and he wouldn’t wish it upon his worst enemy. Although, he would be happy to trade it to a new soldier who didn’t know any better. That was the kind of harmless hazing he could get behind.

The other was labeled “Chicken, Noodles and Vegetables, in Sauce” which happened to be his favorite.

He tore open the MRE bag and separated the package’s contents. The entree and flameless heater pouch were placed to his left. The small pouches of peanut butter and apple jelly were set to his right, while the applesauce with raspberry puree and bag of Skittles were left next to the accessory packet where he’d dumped everything. The accessory pack was the catch-all for little luxuries a soldier may appreciate: instant coffee, creamer, salt, sugar, matches, moist towelettes, and gum that may or may not be laced with laxative.

Once he had everything out and ready, Ethan took in a mouthful of water from a one liter bottle, then spat it into the MRE’s flameless heater system. A single mouthful happened to be just the right amount of water to activate whatever ridiculously unsafe chemicals were inside to heat his meal. He slide entrée pouch into the hear and stood it upright against the tough box, knowing it would take about ten minutes to properly cook.

That was ingenuity folks. Tricks of the trade.

While he waited, Ethan pulled a manila folder and a pencil from inside the tough box. Holding them in one hand, he closed the lid, then set the folder down on top of the box. He pulled a piece of paper with nine blank playing card sized outlines printed on one side. The boys *loved* drawing out their own custom Pokémon cards, so he’d had the idea to go overboard with his own.

The next ten minutes were spent drawing animals on the cards. Each animal was based on pets he’d had throughout his life, which meant they were mostly dogs. Ethan firmly believed there weren’t enough dogs represented in Pokémon, and games in general, and would fight anyone who argued otherwise.

After finishing each drawing, he wrote names for the creature at the top left corner of the cards. It was all for fun, so Ethan didn’t spend more than a moment on each name. Figuring he’d have plenty of time to fill in the rest of the information later, he left the “attack” sections for most of the cards blank. He did take the time to come up with a few stupid puns.

Who didn’t have time for a quality pun?

When the ten minutes were up, he set aside the paper and pencil and smirked. The kind of smirk that says “Uncle Ethan is crazy”.

*“The boys are gonna love these,”* he thought as he opened the pouch and scooped a spoonful of noodles, appreciating the work he’d done in the short time it took his food to cook.

Ethan fell asleep that night feeling calm and relaxed, knowing exactly what tomorrow held in store for him because *he* was the one who had chosen it.

Tomorrow was a new day.

CHAPTER THREE

“Him? Really? You’re sure this is the Alternate you want to choose?”

The voice was old and grizzled, unconvinced that this was their best choice. There were an infinite number of more qualified Alternates.

“Yes, Father,” responded a younger, confident voice. “You said we need to shake things up with as little direct involvement as possible. Sure, he’s a bit naive and will likely cause himself no end of grief, but he has a perspective I think would have a ripple effect in Aidland.”

The Father chuckled as he looked down at the man’s white cargo van. It was parked at a rest stop along I-20 and was barely wide enough to fit a queen size bed in the back, but long enough to create a small living area or kitchen between the bed and front seats. Not that the man owned any of those things.

Instead of a bed, the man slept in a sleeping bag laid across a thin inflatable backpacking mattress. That in turn was placed on top of a foldable foam sleep mat, which was also meant for backpacking. The only other items in the van were a black plastic tough box, a green backpacking pack, and a large green Army duffle bag that was one extra pair of socks away from bursting.

“Very well, my son,” said the Father. “Give him a bit of a head start, so he’ll be less likely to get himself killed, and pick a place to drop him where he’ll have time to acclimate.”

“Yes, Father.”

The Son thought for a moment, a couple locations in mind, but ultimately he’d already made his decision.

The ground around the van shook as the transition took effect, measuring on the low end of the Richter scale, but the man inside didn’t stir. Still deep asleep, he only grumbled and rolled over. Noticing where the van had been placed, the Father bellowed with laughter.

“Ahhh, I see now why you’ve chosen him. This will be interesting. If nothing else, he’ll get the time alone he’s been desperately grasping for.”

“Thank you, Father. I’m glad you like my choice,” a grin spread across the Son’s face. He peered into the van, his brow furrowed as he considered the challenges the Alternate would face.

Case of my friend who did it on his birthday yesterday.,"For those na may balak magpa-vasectomy, whether tatay ka o maging childless, I wanted to share my friend's story (he asked for it to be shared), who took his NSV for free kahapon from DKT Philippines. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1oizsli/i_got_a_noscalpel_vasectomy_today_heres_how_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from u/[selectacornetto](https://www.reddit.com/user/selectacornetto/) re-affirmed his decision that he made 10 years in the making. Since he doesn't want to share his exact age, he's within 25 to 35 range.

What went:

Happened kahapon sa Mary Johnston Hospital sa Tondo, which by this point is well-known na based on what I saw within the subreddits. He was greeted with a bunch of forms that needed to fill and sign, as per usual naman with free vasectomy programs like this. Mga 11 patients sila kahapon.

Pagkatapos ng seminar/orientation, natawagan na yung first patient. Habang nag-aantay, there were photobooths at may free concessionaires naman.

[eto yung freebies niya sa concessionaires \(siya at yung jowa niya hindi nila bet magka-anak, hence the cookie\)](https://preview.redd.it/4sqizerkge2g1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c73d0bc3f1095e100492ee13e16b7411e7a89f6)

He waited until he was called to sit near the operating area. In his words, nung inoobserve niya yung mga machong lalake na nais maging matest ang pagka-macho nila, tuli ka man o hindi.  Most of the men that na nakalabas sa operating area ay medyo ngalay o halatang parang pilay ang lakad. Siguro mga first 2.5 hours naka-7 patients na yung doc. Ready na siya, suot ang patient gown, bare ang likod, parang nakipag-digmaan 'tong si friend ah.

[dito siya nag-antay bago siya tinawagan](https://preview.redd.it/fzkw69s5je2g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7905b84d032688b13b33f3d333c5b2e8878fb21)

Nung turn na niya pumasok, nag-call ng lunch break muna (at debrief daw) so, habang inaantay niya turn niya, nabigyan naman siya ng chickenjoy. Di niya bet mag-chicken pero ok na may makaen kaysa wala nga naman.

Habang palapit na matapos lunch break, bigla niya narealize na dapat naka-shave fully bare yung scrotum area, pero hindi siya sure kung kasama ba lahat ng pubic hairs (madami siyang pubic hair sa sides). Though na-trim naman niya na malayo sa naging operated area, pinacheck niya parin, at oks naman dahil yung scrotum itself dapat ang as bare as possible. So sa mga takot sa razor dyan, pwede mag-trim as long as hindi matatamaan yung ooperahan, basta't bare ang scrotum.

So, balik tayo sa nangyari sa kanya sa operating room. Knowing sanay na siya sa naturukan, walang issue sa local anesthesia, 5 ata rating niya, moderate daw siya sa pain tolerance. Tapos, eto na simula ang pag-tanggal sa vas deferens niya. Sa accounts niya, mga 5-7 mins natapos matanggal yung right vas niya.

Tapos, etong dumating yung kaliwang vas.

Naka-ilan sabi si doc na ""tsk"" kada kinukuha niya yung kaliwa, pero lagi daw nakakatakas sa kapit ng instrument niya. Kalmado si friend until that point. Kasi napansin niya, wala parin siyang naririnig na ""snip"" sound, siguro what felt like 15 - 20 mins. So, narealize ni doc sa second half na malas siya sa positioning ng kaliwang vas ni friend, so kinailangan niya bigyan ng isa pang turok ng anasthetic bago niya i-attempt uli.

Ang paliwanag sa kanya kaya natagalan sa kaliwa ay dahil yung kaliwang parte ng vas niya ay naka-pwesto sa ilalim, whereas sa kanan ay naka-pwesto sa taas, kaya mabilis.

Fortunately, nakuha ni doc yung kaliwa niya at sure enough, na-sabi na niya kay friend na ""ok na, medyo malaki laki nga lang yung sugat mo sa arte ng kaliwa"". Kabado si friend sa left sa tagal, sa dami ng frustration ni doc na hindi makapitan ang kaliwa, hindi nalang napigilan siya at ng mga assistants niya na tumawa nung nag-mura na friend ko sa kaliwang vas.

Overall, it took him around 25 to 35 mins to complete.

Pagkatapos, nakapag-palit na siya ng underwear niya at syempre, dahil gusto niya tignan yung natanggal para murahin niya na may picture, sinumpa na niya siguro dahil sa sakit at hassle na binigyan ng kaliwa niya. Nakapag-selfie pa nga daw siya kay doc para may maalala sa pinagdusa niya. I think naka-isang buwan na ata ng ""putang ina mo vas"" bago siya masatisfy. Tawang-tawa mga staff at si doc dahil dun.

All throughout puro ""happy birthday"" greetings sa kanya before at after ng procedure. Pano ba naman, napansin sa forms sa birthday niya kahapon.

At ayun, binigyan siya ng freebie care kit (same lang sa picture ng ni-link kong post). Though walang supply nung painkiller, at napansin ata ng mga tao na parang siya ang mukang pinaka-normal tignan maglakad. Halos karamihan daw kahapon mukang may pagka-pilay yung lakad, which is normal after ma-NSV. Dun din niya nalaman sa post-op checks na naswertehan siya na natanggal yung vas niya sa ilalim, dahil may kadalasan na hindi nagiging successful ang vasectomy, dahil sa kung saan naka-pwesto ang vas.

Dun din niya nalaman na there were instances na kapag ginawa sa mobile bus nila, medyo magiging challenging kapag nagkaron ng point of failure sa pag-operate sa NSV. Kaya may konting advantage parin if maka-tyempo ka na sa ospital gawin ang NSV.

Kaya sabi ko sa kanya nung pauwi na siya ""kakaiba ka mag-celebrate ng birthday mo pre"" to which niresbakan ako ""bakit, as if may naka-aalala sa birthday ko na hindi si partner"" (ouch). ""Libre nalang kita pagnagkita tayo, para macelebrate ang pagka-macho mo lalo"". Tas binalik sakin ""basta libre mong kupal ka, much love bro"". Kaya handa ko nalang sarili ko sa hangout namin.

As of today, konting kirot lang ang nararamdaman niya, as expected naman daw, pero pretty much goods siya nagwork. So far, hindi niya masyadong ramdam.

Words of advice galing sa kanya:

1. Be absolute sure na ayaw mo talaga mag-ka-anak kung wala kang balak magka-pamilya. Sa case niya, parehas sila ng jowa niya ayaw magka-anak. Sana all talaga.
2. When shaving, siguraduhin yung surrounding hairs sa scortum area mo at least walang aabot sa area ng ooperahan. As long as your balls are bare, goods na yun.
3. You can still wear underwear before the operation, ensure mo lang na as soon as makakuha ka ng schedule ay simulan mo na mag-wear ng loose underwear, magiging mahalaga yun pagdating sa operasyon. Most likely, that made the difference for my friend.
4. Any 4-wheel vehicle that you can ride is advisable on the way home. It took him 3 hours to get back home, malayo pa siya, all his fellow patients ay mga malalapit lang. Pwede ka rin mag-LRT/MRT kung trip mo, like he did kahapon.
5. Kung may partner ka man, feel free to bring them with you sa site. I think sa case ng friend ko, parang 9/11 ata may kasamang asawa at anak nila (Now that's family bonding)

And that's it. He's happy pala to answer your questions (kasama na tanong on how others viewed him on that) or update on his recover progress. Thanks for reading!

Need perspective.,"I have been casually seeing two guys at the same time, and now things are getting a little complicated.

Guy A and I have been seeing each other for a few months. It’s been fun, light, and consistent, but we’re not exclusive and haven’t had any deep conversations about what we are. He actually previously said he wasn’t prioritizing romantic relationships, so I told him I wasn’t going to chase him and would be focusing on other relationships where there’s mutual effort. A few weeks later we reconnected. He had the trip booked already and said I was more than welcome to join him, so I quickly said yes. But upon reflection, I realized this is a big step, especially since we stopped talking for a few weeks and our first time seeing each other again is for this weekend getaway.

Guy B is someone I started talking to in the period when I stopped talking to Guy A. I’ve only seen him twice, but the chemistry is great and he’s giving me the kind of interest/energy I wasn’t sure I’d get from Guy A. We’ve been texting, flirting, sharing memes — very early-stage connection, but promising. 

Here’s the issue:
Neither guy knows the other exists. And while neither of them has asked for exclusivity, now that a trip is involved, I’m feeling weird. I don’t want to mislead anyone, but I also didn’t think either situation was serious enough to require a big “I’m dating other people” conversation yet. I did tell Guy B about the trip, but have not mentioned it’s with this other guy. It’s so early, I don’t feel like I owe him all the details. 

Since reconnecting with Guy A, he’s putting in the effort I initially asked for when I said I wasn’t going to chase him. Beyond inviting me away for the weekend, he’s asked me to get coffee the day before we go, and even mentioned spending Thanksgiving together since neither of us are traveling to visit family. To me, this is quite a shift from him not focusing on romantic relationships. Previously we had great dates and a great connection, and I’m wondering if the connection scared him so he pulled back. Now that he realized I’m serious about not chasing, I’m wondering if this is him prioritizing actually pursing something serious.

Would love some perspective, especially from people who’ve juggled early dating with multiple people before.",0,1763641787.0,dating_advice,14,0.25,False

1p21wef,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildcampingintheuk/comments/1p21wef/planning_for_winter_camping/,Planning for winter camping,"Since we're now heading into proper winter conditions, and as I've seen several posts both in this sub and the UKHiking sub about dealing with wintery conditions in the hills, I thought it worth posting this as I am currently packing for a weekend in the Lake District.

So how do I prepare for a cold weather camp?

Currently, the forecast for the area I am heading tomorrow is showing these conditions (the temperatures take windchill into account):

* **High temp: -5ºC**
* **Low temp: -13ºC**
* **Wind speed: varying from 11mph-25mph over the course of the day, strengthening a little around midnight for a few hours**
* **Max wind gusts: 40mph**

This information is from the mountain-specific forecast from the Met Office for the particular fell I am planning to spend the night on.

**You can get this forecast here:** [**https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/specialist-forecasts/mountain**](https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/specialist-forecasts/mountain)

You can find further region-specific and peak-specific information from choosing the options further down the page.

I also check **MWIS** for a broad overview of the Lake District area: [**https://www.mwis.org.uk**](https://www.mwis.org.uk)

The forecast, as is usually the case with mountainous areas, is changing on an almost hourly basis, but broadly there's no getting around the fact that it'll be very cold. It's also looking a bit windy.

**So my main considerations are keeping warm and having a sturdy tent.**

As such, in addition to the usual gear I'd bring for any Lake District multi day trip (eg water filter, Garmin Messenger, decent power bank, head torch, first aid kit, poo kit, etc) here's what I am taking:

As much as I hate lugging around a heavy tent, I am taking my **Hilleberg Soulo RL**. This tent is actually slight overkill for these conditions but I tend to be quite cautious so am taking this as it's my strongest tent and will shrug off any 40mph gusts if they actually happen. As the temperatures have been consistently low all week, I am expecting the ground to be hard, so I am bringing some **MSR Carbon Core** nail-style stakes, which are much easier to get into hard ground than others.

My **sleeping bag is a** **Mountain Equipment Helium 600**; the comfort rating for this is -8ºC. This is fine despite the windchill outside, as the actual ambient temperature is forecast to be around -1ºC. Windchill is not a factor inside the tent (in fact, my Soulo is usually around 5ºC warmer inside than outside). I'm also bringing a **Sea to Summit** **liner**. This doesn't contribute significantly to thermal rating, but it does make things a bit cosier.

I am bringing my **Nemo Tensor Extreme sleeping pad**. It has a R rating of 8.5 and is incredibly warm. You can actually feel the warmth radiating back at you from it.

In addition to wearing appropriate layers while hiking, which includes bringing along waterproofs, I am bringing my **Rab Mythic jacket** (a very warm, very packable down jacket), **spare Darn Tough wool socks, Icebreaker wool thermals** for sleeping in, a fleece **balaclava**, and warm **gloves** (in fact, two pairs: a pair of Hestra gloves for hiking in, and a pair of Outdoor Research wool gloves for camp). I am also bringing a few of those **disposable hand warmers** (very useful in winter) and **Turbat down socks** for sleeping in. I also have a pair of booties to wear over my down socks that offer a measure of protection if I have to walk outside of the tent. It gives my feet a break from my boots.

I'm bringing plenty of things to keep me feeling warm and cosy: **coffee, soups**, etc. I'm bringing dehydrated Firepot meals as I can't be bothered cooking in cold temperatures. Eating a warm meal or having a warm drink just before jumping into your sleeping bag really helps.

Due to potentially icy ground conditions, I am bringing a set of **microspikes** for my boots (**Kahtoola EXOSpikes)**, although the map suggests the path on my route is mostly gravelly. But since these are reasonably light at just under 200g, they're worth bringing along. I usually hike in trail runners or Vivo barefoot boots, but because of the potential need for spikes, I am wearing my Scarpa boots for this trip. I also always use poles (**Black Diamond Pursuit**) which help with navigating icy terrain.

Obviously I've invested a fair bit in decent gear over the years and I am not necessarily saying you need all these same brands and models and whatnot. But I figured that people new to winter camping may still find it useful seeing the considerations I am making and the decisions I am basing off them. Some stuff, like different tent stakes, may not necessarily be obvious to people who've not pitched on hard ground before.

I'll also keep my cooking gas canister and water bottle in my sleeping bag to avoid the water freezing and the gas getting too cold to ignite. **Do not leave items vulnerable to the cold in the vestibule of your tent**. I'll also keep my power bank and phone in my sleeping bag alongside me.

I have also specifically chosen a mountain that has a very direct, not steep descent in case anything goes wrong and I need to leave in the night.

**Some other tips:**

As winter camping involves a lot more time spent in the tent, bring something to pass the time. I download films/TV series from Netflix, etc onto my phone. I also sometimes bring my Kindle. Sundown at the moment is around 4pm; so I'm looking at probably needing something to pass at least 5-6 hours each evening.

Bring a lantern for your tent. It keeps your morale up having a cosy, lit space.

If you have the space, bring a bottle to wee in during the night, so you don't need to head out into the cold. I'm a woman so I also bring a pee funnel.

CHAPTER ONE

“I hope you know what you’re doing.”

The corgi didn’t move a muscle, the only evidence that it wasn't a statue were a determined “Boof” sound and flinch of its snout.

Its gaze remained locked on the sliding door of the van, reminding Ethan of regal knights from old fairy tales. Its bark, if it could even be called a bark, seemed weak compared to the slobbery, menacing growls coming from outside, making the van feel like a to-go tray filled with a tasty, greasy dinner.

And yet, the small dog looked entirely unbothered.

“Well, alright then,” Ethan grunted as he swung the door open, hoping to catch the wolves off guard.

Before the door was even half way open, the corgi launched itself out of the van like a cannon, vaulting over the closest of the three wolves and landing on the ground facing away from all of them. Ethan for some reason felt afraid for the dog’s safety, as though the dog had been a close friend for years.

Don’t expose your back to wolves!

He was about to yell for the corgi to turn around when it moved. But it didn’t turn around; it started… twerking? Dancing? Whatever it was doing required a lot of butt and hip movement.

All three of the wolves stopped growling, their heads turned to the side like they were working on a particularly difficult puzzle. Ethan could only stare, his mouth open.

After a few moments of silence, he threw his hands up in frustration.

“… the hell?!”

The corgi glanced back with a look on its face that said “Come on man, I can’t keep this up forever.” Anger and confusion vanished as Ethan realized the dog was purposefully providing a distraction.

Chambering a round in his hand gun, he crept out of the van.

The closest wolf, whose fur had a distinct red tinge to it, didn’t even notice as he stopped beside it. Aiming his pistol at the back of the wolf’s head, execution style, Ethan took a deep breath. At the bottom of his exhale he pulled the trigger.

The explosion sent his ears ringing as the wolf collapsed like a bag of bricks, catching a glimpse of whatever bits of skull and brain matter blew out the front before forcing his eyes away.

Growling resumed as the remaining two wolves lost all interest in the corgi and turned toward Ethan, ready to pounce like a dog ready to play, but not nearly as adorable.

The closest of the two, this one with blue fur, launched itself at Ethan. Mid-air, it gathered a faint blue light into its claw. On instinct, Ethan lifted his hand and fired three quick shots, the weight of the wolf barreling into him right as he fired. A slight cold pain numbed his left arm, which probably wasn’t a good sign. The wolf wasn’t moving, which was a better sign.

Dizzy from the ringing in his ears, Ethan decided to hold off on any more shooting if he could help it. Better to conserve his ammo, anyway.

What had happened to the last wolf?

Ethan strained his ears from beneath the weight of the freshly killed wolf, but everything sounded muffled. He couldn’t hear anything other than his own racing heartbeat.

Rolling to the side and shoving the wolf off him, he jumped to his feet, almost falling over as the dizziness settled. With a shake of his head, he looked around. A green furred wolf lay on the ground beside the passenger door of the van, its spine folded backwards. Lying on top of the wolf was the corgi, who looked like it had belly flopped onto the wolf’s back and decided that was a comfortable place to relax.

The yet-unnamed corgi angled its head toward Ethan with a smug look on its face, like Spongebob when he realized Squidward liked Krabby Patties.

“Yes, yes,” Ethan said, breathing out a sigh of relief. “You’re a good girl.”

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

CHAPTER TWO

“There’s nothing quite like a good poop.”

A new man walked out of the rest area bathroom. That’s how he felt anyway — a proverbial weight lifted from his shoulders. Or abdomen, in this case. Ethan reached his hands up to the sky, giving his back a much needed stretch, then headed back to his van.

The particular rest area where Ethan stopped was as good a place as any to get some sleep. He’d driven about ten hours through Texas and was somehow *still* in Texas. Neither New Mexico or Arizona were going to be much better. It didn’t seem to matter, though, as he felt more excited and lighter than he had in a long time.

Not just because of his successful trip to the bathroom.

Friends and family had begun to notice the slump in his shoulders, the bags under his eyes, and general lack of relentless enthusiasm they were used to seeing.

You’d think that someone who’d dreamt his whole life of being in the military would finally find where he belonged; a place where he’d thrive. Turned out four years in the Army had been more than enough for him. Two years would have been the sweet spot. For now, at his wife’s suggestion, Ethan intended on making the most of his newfound freedom.

Plans for the upcoming week filled his head as he climbed into the back of the van, eager to set up his sleep system. With fuel top offs, bathroom breaks, and food stops, he expected to make it to California in two days, right on time for his 30th birthday. He’d hang out with his family and get in as much home cooked food as he could before he set out on his adventure.

What kind of adventure? A backpacking trip across the Pacific Crest Trail. Twenty-six hundred miles of California, Oregon, and Washington wilderness were calling his name, a hike he figured would take him about five months.

*‘That’s a long hike,’* they’d said. 

*‘No way! For real? A couple thousand miles is a long hike? Thanks mom, thanks dad. I never would have realized,’* he’d replied, except not out loud. Only in his head. Whatever, it was fine.

Sarcasm could be therapeutic, sometimes.

Eventually everyone realized he wasn’t joking and started asking real questions. Yes, Rebecca is on board. No, it was her idea in the first place. Yes, they could afford it. No, she and Jack would be staying with her folks. It was as though they assumed zero planning and forethought had been put into the trip.

Ugh, parents. He was a grown man!

To be fair, he understood the skepticism. The most difficult part of this whole trip was that he’d be away from his son for so long. Being in the Army, he was used to not seeing his wife, but his son was still young. It was hard to miss the toddler years.

But they both agreed he needed this. Ethan wasn’t dumb, he knew Rebecca needed it too. He’d become progressively more difficult to live with, so this was as much a break for her as it was for him. Besides, they’d video chat as often as possible and he could fly back to spend time with them as often as needed.

So… in theory, Ethan wasn’t in too much of a hurry.

After four years of being told what to do, he was eager to take his time and go at his own pace. They’d saved up enough money over the past year to not need to work for a while, his recent deployment making it much easier. It was amazing what he could do with a year of tax free income.

Before starting the hike, Ethan looked forward to spending time with his nephews. They were *huge* Pokémon nerds, especially the trading cards. He and his brother, their dad, had grown up playing and collecting them, so he was technically a nerd too.

Ethan had promised he’d battle them in the trading card game, even though he hadn’t owned any cards since the prior Christmas when he’d sent them all to the boys as a gift. After a while, he kinda wished he had kept his cards from when he was a kid. Oh well. Most of the fun came from opening the packs anyway; the excitement that came from the potential in each unopened pack could be addicting.

The plan was to stop at a comic book store the following day to buy a starter deck and maybe a box of booster packs. He’d settle for a Target if he couldn’t find one nearby. Again, technically, he wasn’t in a rush.

Plenty-o-time.

Not quite tired enough to fall asleep, Ethan unrolled his sleeping bag, then opened the tough box in the back of the van. Inside were a few dozen MREs (Meal Ready to Eat) that he had “tactically acquired” from the training room before signing out of his unit on his last day in the Army. They were intended to be used on the hike, but he didn’t feel like stopping for food out in the middle of Texas.

MREs. Bleh.

Still a better option than vending machine food, though he may have been willing to part with a stack of quarters if any of the machines had a Reese’s Snack Cake. Those things were basically crack cocaine.

Ethan grabbed two of the MREs, looking over the names.

One was “Pork Sausage Patty, Maple Flavored”. He mentally gagged as he tossed it back in the tough box. That MRE was the bane of his existence and he wouldn’t wish it upon his worst enemy. Although, he would be happy to trade it to a new soldier who didn’t know any better. That was the kind of harmless hazing he could get behind.

The other was labeled “Chicken, Noodles and Vegetables, in Sauce” which happened to be his favorite.

He tore open the MRE bag and separated the package’s contents. The entree and flameless heater pouch were placed to his left. The small pouches of peanut butter and apple jelly were set to his right, while the applesauce with raspberry puree and bag of Skittles were left next to the accessory packet where he’d dumped everything. The accessory pack was the catch-all for little luxuries a soldier may appreciate: instant coffee, creamer, salt, sugar, matches, moist towelettes, and gum that may or may not be laced with laxative.

Once he had everything out and ready, Ethan took in a mouthful of water from a one liter bottle, then spat it into the MRE’s flameless heater system. A single mouthful happened to be just the right amount of water to activate whatever ridiculously unsafe chemicals were inside to heat his meal. He slide entrée pouch into the hear and stood it upright against the tough box, knowing it would take about ten minutes to properly cook.

That was ingenuity folks. Tricks of the trade.

While he waited, Ethan pulled a manila folder and a pencil from inside the tough box. Holding them in one hand, he closed the lid, then set the folder down on top of the box. He pulled a piece of paper with nine blank playing card sized outlines printed on one side. The boys *loved* drawing out their own custom Pokémon cards, so he’d had the idea to go overboard with his own.

The next ten minutes were spent drawing animals on the cards. Each animal was based on pets he’d had throughout his life, which meant they were mostly dogs. Ethan firmly believed there weren’t enough dogs represented in Pokémon, and games in general, and would fight anyone who argued otherwise.

After finishing each drawing, he wrote names for the creature at the top left corner of the cards. It was all for fun, so Ethan didn’t spend more than a moment on each name. Figuring he’d have plenty of time to fill in the rest of the information later, he left the “attack” sections for most of the cards blank. He did take the time to come up with a few stupid puns.

Who didn’t have time for a quality pun?

When the ten minutes were up, he set aside the paper and pencil and smirked. The kind of smirk that says “Uncle Ethan is crazy”.

*“The boys are gonna love these,”* he thought as he opened the pouch and scooped a spoonful of noodles, appreciating the work he’d done in the short time it took his food to cook.

Ethan fell asleep that night feeling calm and relaxed, knowing exactly what tomorrow held in store for him because *he* was the one who had chosen it.

Tomorrow was a new day.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

CHAPTER THREE

“Him? Really? You’re sure this is the Alternate you want to choose?”

The voice was old and grizzled, unconvinced that this was their best choice. There were an infinite number of more qualified Alternates.

“Yes, Father,” responded a younger, confident voice. “You said we need to shake things up with as little direct involvement as possible. Sure, he’s a bit naive and will likely cause himself no end of grief, but he has a perspective I think would have a ripple effect in Aidland.”

The Father chuckled as he looked down at the man’s white cargo van. It was parked at a rest stop along I-20 and was barely wide enough to fit a queen size bed in the back, but long enough to create a small living area or kitchen between the bed and front seats. Not that the man owned any of those things.

Instead of a bed, the man slept in a sleeping bag laid across a thin inflatable backpacking mattress. That in turn was placed on top of a foldable foam sleep mat, which was also meant for backpacking. The only other items in the van were a black plastic tough box, a green backpacking pack, and a large green Army duffle bag that was one extra pair of socks away from bursting.

“Very well, my son,” said the Father. “Give him a bit of a head start, so he’ll be less likely to get himself killed, and pick a place to drop him where he’ll have time to acclimate.”

“Yes, Father.”

The Son thought for a moment, a couple locations in mind, but ultimately he’d already made his decision.

The ground around the van shook as the transition took effect, measuring on the low end of the Richter scale, but the man inside didn’t stir. Still deep asleep, he only grumbled and rolled over. Noticing where the van had been placed, the Father bellowed with laughter.

“Ahhh, I see now why you’ve chosen him. This will be interesting. If nothing else, he’ll get the time alone he’s been desperately grasping for.”

“Thank you, Father. I’m glad you like my choice,” a grin spread across the Son’s face. He peered into the van, his brow furrowed as he considered the challenges the Alternate would face.

“Show us what kind of man you are, Ethan Farris.”",1,1763641703.0,fiction,0,1.0,False
1p21vrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1p21vrg/update_i_told_my_bestfriend_shes_not_the_only_one/,"Update: I told my bestfriend, she’s not the only one in a relationship!","I am 21F using my throwaway account because my friends follow my main one.

So yesterday me and my friends planned to grab a quick snack in our university cafeteria, and one of my friends said she can’t come since she has to grab lunch with her boyfriend. To give some context: we are a trio friend group, and the friend in question (let’s call her X) studied with me in the same school before university, so we share a lot of history. We are also in almost all the same classes. The other girl in the trio (S) doesn’t share many classes with us, so basically me and X are together almost all the time in class.

Six months ago, I met with a major accident which left me in a wheelchair temporarily. I still use the wheelchair for longer commutes, but I’m improving with rehab. Despite everything, we three are good friends. X got into her relationship soon after college began, and from the outside it seems very dysfunctional. Her boyfriend is extremely lazy and makes her carry his bag most of the time, but whatever works for them. We don’t discuss relationships because her relationship always caused strain in our friendship. Also, S just had her breakup, and I’m in a long-distance relationship for 4 years.

Now X is very involved with her boyfriend. She started missing classes, almost stays at his home all day until she has to go home, uses our names as excuses (saying she has college even on Sundays), and goes to his home because he calls her to “study together” — but from what I hear he just sits around watching TV while she studies. Her reasoning is that she loves him so much and feels comfortable with him, but what we see is he’s isolating and controlling her. X used to study really well, but after getting into this relationship her grades dropped and she’s barely passing because she spends all her time writing HIS assignments and recording HIS notes. Even before this, whenever we plan on going out, she says that he may call, so she always cancels.

Yesterday, since I can now walk short distances and my birthday is in 5 days, I thought I could treat both of them to thank them for the emotional support during this hard time. I want to emphasise that I did not ask much help from either of them at all — I arranged my own accommodations, I managed almost everything alone, and in the past 6 months I have probably asked them for help like 2–3 days total. Even when I genuinely needed support, I didn’t depend on them much.  
There was even one time when I asked X to have lunch with me because I couldn’t go to our usual lunch places due to being in a wheelchair and I didn’t want to eat completely alone in the classroom. She usually goes to her boyfriend’s home for lunch, but that day she came, sat with me, and then kept complaining loudly to everyone passing by that “it’s so unfortunate” that she has to sit there and have lunch with me. Mind you, it wasn’t even an isolated place — it was right outside my classroom, and three other classmates (with whom I don’t even talk) were already having their lunch there, so she wasn’t even alone with me. I felt so small and embarrassed.

So when I invited them both to the cafeteria (which is less than a 2-minute walk), she came with S and immediately asked till what time we were planning to stay. I said I don’t know, it depends on how fast the food comes. Then she asked if I would sponsor her boyfriend’s food, for which I declined and said I don’t have enough cash for all four — our café is priced high, even a basic coffee costs triple the normal amount.

She then said okay and told S she would be back in a while. S asked where she was going, and X said she was going with her boyfriend to grab lunch. I replied that this is the first time in 6 months we are actually sitting together for lunch. Even before my accident she always refused saying “my bf may need me.” This was a rare occasion.

She then said, “I’m not going to eat lunch with him, just buy lunch with him and come back,” which sounded stupid. So I said, “He has his own vehicle, he can buy his lunch.” She replied, “This is what we do, we do everything together. You guys would only understand when you both have real relationships.”

That clearly shocked both of us. Mind you, this is her first relationship, she is like the 4th+ girlfriend of her boyfriend, S just had a breakup from a 2+ year relationship, and I am in a 4-year long-distance relationship. So I got mad and said she’s not the only one in a relationship.

She got mad and left. She came back after 30 minutes and I paid for her food anyway, but didn’t engage in any conversation with her. She didn’t apologize.

1p21ty5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyingPeople/comments/1p21ty5/how_to_study_well/,How to Study Well,"# Things You Should Know

* To study productively, create a daily study schedule, organize your desk, backpack, and study materials, and rewrite your notes to make study guides.
* Study at a quiet desk or table and remove any distractions, like phones. Take short breaks, alternate subjects, or have a healthy snack to avoid fatigue.
* Attend your classes and ask your teacher or study group questions about your assigned reading, notes, or key concepts.

# Create a study space

**Set up your study space.** It’s great if you have a desk for studying, but a table will also work great. Make sure your space has good lighting and remove any clutter or distractions that might break your focus. Place the materials you need to study, like pens, highlighters, and a notebook, near the area so they’re handy.

* It’s okay to switch up your study spot if that’s more convenient for you. For instance, you might like studying at the library or a coffee shop sometimes.
* Play music while you study so it's more fun. Create a playlist of songs that inspire you but aren't distracting. You might try instrumental music if you get distracted easily, but it's okay to listen to whatever you like.
* **Reader Poll:** We asked 460 wikiHow readers which study space they found most effective for staying focused and productive, and **48%** of them said, **a quiet library cubicle.**

# Create a schedule

**Create a daily study schedule for yourself.** Rather than trying to do all your studies in 1 day, plan to study a little every day. Start by choosing the time of day when you feel the most focused. Then, decide which subjects you’ll study each day. Keep your study schedule in your agenda or somewhere you can see it every day.[^(\[2\])](https://www.wikihow.com/Study-Well#_note-2)

* Everyone has a different time of day when they feel most energized. You might find that you learn best early in the morning, but it’s also possible you might like studying right after school or before bed. Do what works best for you.
* If you participate in sports or activities, keep these in mind when planning your studies. Let’s say you have sports practice every day after school. You might decide it’s best to study for an hour each evening before bed and an hour every morning before school to accommodate your sports schedule.

# Organize your materials

**Organize your study materials so it's easy to find what you need.** You probably have a lot to do, so you need to spend your time wisely. Keep all of your papers, notebooks, texts, and writing utensils in a specific place so you don’t waste precious study time looking for them. This way you can quickly pull out what you need and get started.

* For example, you might keep your pencils, pens, highlighters, and erasers in a pencil pouch in your backpack. If you also have a desk at home, you could keep a cup of them on your desktop. Try using colorful pens for notes you write for yourself so it's more fun.
* If your instructor sends handouts and readings in digital files, save yours to a Google Drive that you can access from any device. This way you’ll always have what you need.
* You could use a hole-punch to add holes to handouts, readings, and other paper items so you can keep them in a binder. As another option, you could keep them in a folder. Pick a binder or folder that has an image you like on it! You might even decorate it.
* Keep books or notebooks in your bookbag or beside your study space.

# Remove distractions

**Remove distractions so you can stay focused on your studies.** You’ll have an easier time focusing if there aren’t distractions around. Ask the people around you to not disturb you while you’re studying. Additionally, turn off your TV and silence your phone so you won’t be tempted to check it.

* If there’s clutter nearby your study spot, you might want to remove it if you find it distracting.
* Try using a productivity app or website that can block social media and other distracting apps or sites during your study time.

# Review your notes

**Review your notes at the end of each school day so everything is fresh.** You'll likely need to re-read your notes a few times before they start to stick in your mind. Set aside a few minutes every day to go back over what you learned in all of your classes. It doesn't need to be a big block of time.

* Look for a few minutes of downtime, like when you're waiting for the bus, sitting on the ride home, or waiting for your after-school events to start.

# Focus on key concepts

**Focus on key concepts rather than minor details.** It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you’re studying because there’s so much information to learn. You don’t need to memorize your notes and textbook to do well in class. Instead, study the main points that your instructor pointed out in class. Then, figure out how the minor details and examples in your notes or text help you better understand the main points.

* In English class, you could start with a story’s theme. Then, you might look for ways the author used literary devices to support that theme.
* In math class, you might focus on the formulas you’re learning and how to use them. Later, you can figure out how the specific math problems your teacher gave you help you practice.
* In History class, you might focus on the social and historical factors that lead to war rather than specific dates and people.

# Read key notes out loud

 **Read key information out loud to help commit it to memory.** Reading aloud can help you remember something better, so use this strategy for important points. Go somewhere you won’t disturb anyone else. Then, slowly read your notes or the text to yourself to see if it helps you remember it.

* You might also try reading aloud when you’re having trouble understanding something.

# Tailor your studies to your learning style

**Incorporate activities that fit your learning style.** Figure out which learning style fits you most. Visual learners absorb more information when they can see it, auditory learners take in information by listening, and kinesthetic learners engage more with movement. Personalize your study sessions by using your learning style.

* If you're a visual learner, you might highlight your notes or text. You may also try incorporating a documentary or slideshow into your studies. You might also like drawing a mind map so you can represent what you're thinking visually.
* If you're an auditory learner, you might try singing your notes, reading aloud, or listening to your text on audiobook.
* If you're a kinesthetic learner, try acting out your notes or walking around while you read or listen to an audiobook. Physically manipulating flashcards or drawing a mind map might also work for you.

# Make connections to preexisting knowledge

**Look for links between what you’re learning and what you already know.** Sometimes you might feel like what you’re learning in class has nothing to do with your real life, but that’s usually not true. Making connections between what you’re learning and what you already know can help deepen your understanding of the material and may help you remember it better. Try to brainstorm links between what you’re studying and something you’ve experienced.

* For instance, maybe you used math to determine the area of your walls when you were buying new paint.
* Similarly, you might think about how the characters in a story you’ve read relate to people you know in real life.

# Create a study guide

**Rewrite your notes with extra information to create a study guide.** Making a study guide helps you review the material and gives you something to review in future study sessions. Start by typing your notes into a blank document. Then, use your textbook and online resources to add to your existing notes. Additionally, answer questions from your textbook or ones that come to mind as you study.

* This is a good way to study because it requires you to take an extra step past reading your notes and textbook. Reading, thinking, and writing are ingredients essential for an efficient study session.
* You might prefer to hand-write your notes. Keep a set of colored pens or markers just for this. It'll be more fun to rewrite your notes if you use special supplies.

# Take a break

**Take a 10 to 15-minute break every hour you study.** You want to use your time wisely, so you might think breaks are a bad idea. However, trying to focus on your studies for too long can cause fatigue. Instead, schedule breaks into your study sessions so you can burn off a little steam. When you come back, you’ll be refreshed and ready to pick back up where you left off.

* If you feel like you get distracted easily, you might try the Pomodoro technique instead. Set a timer for 25 minutes and try to study that entire time. Take a 2- to 3-minute break, then start the next session. Do a total of 4 study blocks, with short breaks between them. After the 4th block, either stop studying for the day or take a longer 15-minute break before you start another study block.
* Use your breaks for something that energizes you, like getting a snack or going for a short walk. Don’t turn on your TV or a video game because it might distract you.

# Eat a healthy snack

**Eat healthy snacks to energize your mind.** Snacking while you study can help you stay focused and might help you study longer. Just make sure you choose healthy snacks over junk food. Keep your snacks near your study space or grab them when you take a study break. Here are some snacks that can help you stay focused while you study:

* Fruit
* Almonds
* Popcorn
* Trail mix
* Carrots and hummus
* Dark chocolate
* Greek yogurt
* Apple slices and peanut butter
* Grapes

# Alternate subjects

**Alternate subjects so you don’t get burned out.** Try not to study 1 subject for too long because you’ll probably get bored after a while. Unfortunately, this can make it harder for you to remember what you’ve studied. Instead, set time limits for how long you’ll focus on each subject, then switch to something else.

* For example, you might decide to study Math and English on Monday afternoons. If you have 2 hours to study, you might study Math for 45 minutes, take a 15-minute break, then study English for 45 minutes. You could spend the final 15 minutes doing a self-test or review.
* Do the subject that interests you least first so you'll be more excited to switch topics.

# Make flash cards

**Make flash cards for the information you need to memorize.** You can use flash cards for most subjects, and they can be a great tool for testing yourself. Use flashcards to learn vocabulary, mathematical formulas, historical dates and figures, scientific facts and processes, etc. You can make your own cards or print some online. Then, flip through your cards to test your knowledge.

* Making the cards yourself is super beneficial because you’ll have to write out all of the information you’re learning when you create the cards.
* You can find pre-made flashcards about many topics on the website Quizlet.

# Make a mind map

**Create a mind map to organize the information you’re learning.** Mind maps can help you make connections between what you’re learning. Start by drawing a circle and writing the topic inside the circle. Then, draw spokes away from the center circle and draw circles at the end of each spoke. Inside those circles, write the main points you’ve learned about the topic so far. Keep branching off of each circle you draw with new facts and details about the topic.

* Try looking up example mind maps online to see how others have used this technique to study.

# Use online resources

**Use online tutorials if you’re struggling with the material.** You might not understand every subject right away, and that’s totally okay. Luckily, you can find study guides and video tutorials online that can help you study better. Look for study help as soon as you start having trouble so you can get the help you need.

* For instance, Khan Academy has a lot of video tutorials you can watch for free. You can also find videos on YouTube.

# Get a full night of sleep

**Sleep 8-10 hours a night so you’re well-rested.** Teens aged 14- to 17-years-old need at least 8 hours of sleep every night for good health. If you are sleep deprived, studying will feel like a chore. You won't learn nearly as much information sleepy as you will after a good night's rest.

* If you’re 18 or older, you need 7-9 hours of sleep each night, while kids who are 6- to 13-years-old need 9-11 hours of sleep.

# Test yourself

**Test yourself to review what you’ve studied.** At the end of each study session, set aside 15-20 minutes for a self-test of the material. Do a practice test if you can, but you can also flip through your flashcards or block off parts of your notes to see if you can remember the information. This can help you retain more of what you studied and helps you identify the material you need to study again.

* Ask a friend or family member to quiz you if you can. Have them ask you questions about the material and check your answers.
* Take a practice exam using questions from your study guide or example tests online. This will help you identify any areas you need to review again.
* If you're wrong, go through the correct answers.

# Avoid cramming for tests

**Don’t cram for tests because it likely won’t work.** Like most people, you’ll need a few days for the material to really sink in, so studying a bunch the night before a test likely won’t work out. Chances are, you’ll forget most of what you study during your cram session. Instead, stick to the study schedule you made for yourself so you can learn a little at a time.

* You probably have friends who brag about how cramming works for them, but you don’t know what’s really going on behind the scenes. Ignore what other people say and do what’s best for you.
* Try planning something fun and relaxing for the night before your exam, like a bubble bath or watching your favorite movie with a friend. This way you'll have something to look forward to that might motivate you to stick to your study schedule.

# Teach someone else the material

**Teach the information to others to help deepen your understanding.** Explaining something to someone else helps you retain the information better. Give a short lesson about what you’re currently studying to a classmate, friend, or family member. Then, ask them if they have any questions about the subject. Do your best to answer the questions.

* If you get a question you can’t answer, find out the answer so you’ll fill in that information gap.
* If you’re sharing with a classmate, take turns “teaching” each other. This way you’ll be getting double the information!

# Weave in physical activity

**Be active during your study breaks to improve your focus.** Cardio activity boosts blood flow, which helps your brain work better. Additionally, being active may help improve your memory. Try going for a walk, doing jumping jacks, or dancing to your favorite song during your study breaks.

* Pick an exercise you enjoy so your study breaks are fun.

# Join a study group

**Start or join a study group to learn from each other.** Study groups help you all learn better because you can share different ideas and explain the material to each other. Ask your classmates to form a study group with you, then schedule meetups at least once a week. Do your best to stay on task so you can get the most out of your study sessions.

* Ask each study group member when they’re available so you can pick the perfect time for your study group. For example, you might arrange to meet after school in the library every Tuesday.
* If you’re all busy with after-school activities, you could schedule a study session in the library or a local coffee shop every Saturday at noon.
* It’s okay to meet more often than once a week if your schedules allow.

I’ve bootstrapped a startup, taught tech to thousands, and now split my time between campus case discussions, weightroom therapy, and discovering new filter coffee spots. My happy weekends are bookstores, board games, indie films, street food, and long walks where the conversation wanders further than we do. Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can’t stop thinking about this week—economics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1—your pick.

Boundaries:  safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

If any of this resonates, send a thoughtful opener: your city, a recent idea that shook you, and a niche hill you’d die on. I’ll go first—mine change often, but right now: “Speed is a habit; depth is a practice.” I reply best to messages with curiosity, clarity, and a little wonder.

So yesterday me and my friends planned to grab a quick snack in our university cafeteria, and one of my friends said she can’t come since she has to grab lunch with her boyfriend. To give some context: we are a trio friend group, and the friend in question (let’s call her X) studied with me in the same school before university, so we share a lot of history. We are also in almost all the same classes. The other girl in the trio (S) doesn’t share many classes with us, so basically me and X are together almost all the time in class.

Six months ago, I met with a major accident which left me in a wheelchair temporarily. I still use the wheelchair for longer commutes, but I’m improving with rehab. Despite everything, we three are good friends. X got into her relationship soon after college began, and from the outside it seems very dysfunctional. Her boyfriend is extremely lazy and makes her carry his bag most of the time, but whatever works for them. We don’t discuss relationships because her relationship always caused strain in our friendship. Also, S just had her breakup, and I’m in a long-distance relationship for 4 years.

Now X is very involved with her boyfriend. She started missing classes, almost stays at his home all day until she has to go home, uses our names as excuses (saying she has college even on Sundays), and goes to his home because he calls her to “study together” — but from what I hear he just sits around watching TV while she studies. Her reasoning is that she loves him so much and feels comfortable with him, but what we see is he’s isolating and controlling her. X used to study really well, but after getting into this relationship her grades dropped and she’s barely passing because she spends all her time writing HIS assignments and recording HIS notes. Even before this, whenever we plan on going out, she says that he may call, so she always cancels.

Yesterday, since I can now walk short distances and my birthday is in 5 days, I thought I could treat both of them to thank them for the emotional support during this hard time. I want to emphasise that I did not ask much help from either of them at all — I arranged my own accommodations, I managed almost everything alone, and in the past 6 months I have probably asked them for help like 2–3 days total. Even when I genuinely needed support, I didn’t depend on them much.  
There was even one time when I asked X to have lunch with me because I couldn’t go to our usual lunch places due to being in a wheelchair and I didn’t want to eat completely alone in the classroom. She usually goes to her boyfriend’s home for lunch, but that day she came, sat with me, and then kept complaining loudly to everyone passing by that “it’s so unfortunate” that she has to sit there and have lunch with me. Mind you, it wasn’t even an isolated place — it was right outside my classroom, and three other classmates (with whom I don’t even talk) were already having their lunch there, so she wasn’t even alone with me. I felt so small and embarrassed.

So when I invited them both to the cafeteria (which is less than a 2-minute walk), she came with S and immediately asked till what time we were planning to stay. I said I don’t know, it depends on how fast the food comes. Then she asked if I would sponsor her boyfriend’s food, for which I declined and said I don’t have enough cash for all four — our café is priced high, even a basic coffee costs triple the normal amount.

She then said okay and told S she would be back in a while. S asked where she was going, and X said she was going with her boyfriend to grab lunch. I replied that this is the first time in 6 months we are actually sitting together for lunch. Even before my accident she always refused saying “my bf may need me.” This was a rare occasion.

She then said, “I’m not going to eat lunch with him, just buy lunch with him and come back,” which sounded stupid. So I said, “He has his own vehicle, he can buy his lunch.” She replied, “This is what we do, we do everything together. You guys would only understand when you both have real relationships.”

That clearly shocked both of us. Mind you, this is her first relationship, she is like the 4th+ girlfriend of her boyfriend, S just had a breakup from a 2+ year relationship, and I am in a 4-year long-distance relationship. So I got mad and said she’s not the only one in a relationship.

She got mad and left. She came back after 30 minutes and I paid for her food anyway, but didn’t engage in any conversation with her. She didn’t apologize.

At no point was there a place to choose a drink package; nor did it indicate a drink package was included.  The advertisement noted dinks and Wi-Fi were included, but I expected those items to show up somewhere as stating they are included.  I don’t want to assume the final price is not really the final price.

There also seems to be a large number of cabin variations, we really just want a balcony and a bit of extra space in the room like a love seat or pair of comfortable chairs for sitting.  We might drink coffee on the balcony or sit and relax for bit in the afternoon or evening.  We are not picky about location as long as the view is unobstructed.  Is there anything I need to look out for?  My plan was to choose the least expensive guaranteed balcony room.

We’ve never sailed on Celebrity and are looking at a couple different trips with different cruise lines, and trying to get to a final price that includes a balcony room, drinks and Wi-Fi is a bit overwhelming.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I've been following this subreddit for a while, and like many of you, I was annoyed that international platforms take 5%+ off every creator tip. I wanted to build a native solution for the Indian creator economy that respects the creator's earnings.

The result is Chai4.me, a pure peer-to-peer UPI tip jar.

💡 The Goal: 0% Commission
The core idea was to make the money go directly from the supporter to the creator. This bypasses the need for a payment gateway middleman, which is where 99% of the transaction fee usually comes from.

What I Built:
Zero Commission: No platform fees. Creators keep 100%.

P2P UPI: Instant payment directly to the creator's account.

Clean Creator Page: Simple, fast setup with just a UPI ID.

I need your honest feedback on a major trade-off:
Since it's a direct P2P transfer, the supporter sees the creator's public UPI name during the payment. Is the 0% commission worth this trade-off for creators, or is anonymity more important?
