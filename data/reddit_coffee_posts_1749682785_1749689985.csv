I am way more bothered that I like to admit.,"hi to all. i'm sorry to bother but i have gone from being slightly amused by the fact (context below) to being a bit sad and angry. I don't know how to proceed from here.  My lifelong friend (M31) did not invite me (F30) to his wedding, after saying that I am one of the most important people in his life. 

This is our story, just for ranting and provide some context.



First day of high school, I met ""Toby”. I was shy, insecure, a bit bullied and without friends - he was witty, beloved and made everyone laugh, including teachers. I fell for him head over heels. He initially avoided me like the plague as he was a bit annoyed that i was at his “level” (he and I were the best students in the class, but he was used to be the one and only best student). Then we discovered that we lived near each other and became friends. 



Soon he caught rumors that I had feelings for him - I was WAY too shy to tell him directly, but as i said i was somewhat bullied, my feelings were pretty evident and a good bullying topic, i guess. Toby started to avoid me again, even worse than before, talking to me only for school-related topics (mainly he asked help for some subjects) and only if necessary. Yes I know, he somewhat used me. The power dynamic was totally in his favor as I was competely starstruck by his charm.  Now I know that I have ADHD and that was a manual case of limerence. But I had no way of knowing that back then. I was 14 and naive, and it gets way worse.



As the years passed, i had managed to silence the bullies and to find my own friends, but my low self-esteem and desperate need for romantic attention called for their toll. I got a boyfriend, but he was a walking red flag and an abuser who repeatedly hit me in class and would stalk me when i tried to end things. Toby never defended me. No one of my male friends did. Only a female, petite friend tried to defend me and risked her life. She was my best friend for nearly a decade before turning into a judgemental bigot but that’s another story.



When i finally managed to escape that situation, Toby started to talk to me again. We became real friends this time, i fell for him again but it was short-lived. Once, a mutual female friend (who was also very close to him) kissed him (lightly) on the lips in a joke/endearing way (mind you, we were 18 and slightly drunk), and I thought ‘fuck it, if she can do it, i can too’. So I did the same after her, with a “there you go, your two best friends” joke or something cringey like that… to this day I still don’t know. However, I found it to be not so ‘special’ as i thought, so i let it all go, for real. It was SO liberating. 



School went by, I graduated and went to college. There, I met ‘Charles’, and he wiped away EVERYTHING. I was in therapy for my abusive relationship and he had the patience and love to understand and respect me. Charles always, always made me feel loved and respected in a way that no one else had. We were \~21yo kids though, and we hit a rough patch later on. 



I was hanging out with my friends from high school for comfort, and one time, Toby tagged along. We were still friends, but not so close as we were in school. He tried to be close again, I figured out that he would be an adult at this point, so I carefully let him back into my life, this time with a more balanced power dynamic, since i could call him out of his bullshit when needed - and oh was it needed. 



In that phase of his life he went borderline incel. He would say shit like “women don’t want me because i’m ugly and they are superficial” “why can’t i fuck someone when all my other college friends can” “yes i could make a move with girl X, but she’s ugly and has a horrible nose” like my brother in christ. if you appear so desperate you will scare women away, and how about stop body shaming people when you are clearly not a Henry Cavill lookalike. Beside that, you did it IN FRONT OF YOUR FEMALE FRIEND who HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU ONCE and HAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY (i look midwestern and have black hair, i kinda look like Jasmine of the Aladdin animation movie, i certainly don’t have a cutie little up-pointing nose).  It hurt, but I didn’t admit it, however, I told him to stop being a douchebag and to view women as something more than sex dolls. He knew i was right, and after some time - we were like 24 - he told me he had found a (perfect, blonde, cutie-nosed) girlfriend ‘Ava’, and I was happy for him! I was back with Charles (we had fixed our relationship, still together to this day <3 ), and we occasionally hung out all together. 



This was the best phase of our friendship. We would catch on for coffee and talk for hours, we were at each other’s graduations, celebrated our first jobs, helped each other during the pandemic. I was at Toby and Ava’s house crying my eyeballs out when Charles had to move away for job reasons. Toby truly was one of my strongest friendships - or so i thought. I always had the vibe that Ava did not like me, but I brushed it off, we exchanged polite talk but i could never get along with her as a friend, all my attempts were met with a polite but firm not-trespassing-limit. However, I was mainly friend with Toby and also he and Charles never got along, so we had our fragile equilibrium.



Two years ago, things went downhill. Toby was silent for a while, so I asked a mutual friend, Nigel, if he had seen him recently. casually mentioned Toby had just survived a life-threatening medical crisis *-* a month-long ordeal I knew *nothing* about. I was speechless. I thought we were friends, and he told me NOTHING. Fair, maybe he did not want to, those things are scary. Nigel tried to comfort me, but being as sensitive as a rock (bless him) told this hurtful literal sentence: “Don’t worry, he DOES NOT NEED YOU, he has Ava.” The very next day I called Toby in tears, saying that Nigel told me about his health and that I was so sorry, offering my help for whatever he needed. He told it was okay, that it was not a big deal, and that it had been resolved. Thing is - it WAS a big deal. I have a major in a medical field and so does he, he should know better. Way worse, it was probably work-related. He told me he wanted to switch job but it was hard. I encouraged him to do so, because that condition can come back. He told me he would think about it.



Months later, Nigel (the oldest of us) turned 30. Charles and I were at his birthday party, and so were Toby and Ava. Since Charles and Toby are not fond of each other, it was the first time they were seeing each other in a long time. Toby was absolutely AWFUL with Charles. He kept pushing him to the edge, told him he’s boring (he’s not, he’s the funniest person I know), and acted like a self-centered prat all the evening. This was not the first time he would do that. The previous year, at my birthday, he monologued all the time ranting about government and engaging in a discussion with the previously mentioned petite friend who would (rightfully) call him out from his bullshit, making the party awkward for all the guests. That time I told him to fuck off and that i would never invite him again if he would not control himself. This time I told him to leave Charles the fuck alone, and he procedeed to go to the dancefloor with Ava. Nigel approached me and told me that he often acted as a jerk with him too, and implied that he would bend over backwards only for Ava, and he did not care about anyone else. This was a vibe I’ve perceived before - yes he was a bit of a doormat but however. Nigel told me another thing I did not know. Toby had just bought a flat, even if he had already been living in a bigger apartment that his parents were giving him for free. In my city is VERY difficult to buy real estate, he basically had to open a huge mortgage to buy this flat, and this means that he will never change job. I asked Nigel why would he do that when the flat he was living in was perfectly fine. He rolled his eyes and said “for love”. Basically, he bought this flat so Ava could be TEN MINUTES closer to her jobsite. Ok, I get it, ten minutes every day in the commutes are a fair amount of time. But not worth a $250K mortgage IMHO. However, that is their life and their decisions so I said nothing, also to not rat Nigel out.



Later on that evening, I heard him recalling how one time he was feeling dizzy and OCCASIONALLY had SEIZURES (!), related to his health incident (he KNEW), and after DAYS (!!) of this going on, he passed out at work, and since that day he was working in a public hospital, the nurses put him on electrolytes a split second before cardiac arrest. I. LOST. IT. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind and if that was a joke for him. He was telling it all like it was a funny story, not reading the room at all, the other people were horrified.  I was thinking about his poor mom whom I see weekly in church and is very affectionate towards me. About his sister who is a dear friend of mine. Toby’s health stressed them so much that his mom ended up in hospital. My own mom cried when she found out he had been sick. And here he was, recalling a life-threatening situation just to be the coolest person in the room, with Ava totally unbothered. I asked her what the heck was she thinking when he saw him literally having seizures. Toby answered for her, that she trusted him as he was saying it was all ok. I barely held back from yelling ""How are you this dumb?!"" and just said: “next time you notice something strange, call me, don’t trust him”.  After that evening, I told him that I did not want anything to do with him anymore, mainly for how he treated Charles. Toby begged me not to, apologized and said  “you and Nigel are the most important people in my life”.  We accepted the apologies, but I went kinda low contact anyway and Toby did not even notice.



We met again at another group event. Ava approached me glowingly and showed a ring. I genuinely congratulated them, we all had a chat and they told me the plans that they had for their wedding, which they planned out of town. I mentally took note of that, thinking that  I could probably not make it unless Nigel or someone else gave me a ride, since I cannot drive for medical reasons. But months passed by, and  as I was abroad for my PhD, I started to think that maybe I actually could not attend the wedding. I contacted Nigel asking discreetly info on the date and location, to see if he could be down to give me a ride. Nigel did not know the location but told me the date. Mind that at this point, Toby had not told me ANYTHING.



The wedding is this Sunday, and Toby did not invite me. And it’s not that we are NC. We texted a bit, mainly about job- and health-related topics, but we were still in contact. I cannot shake the feeling that Ava did not want me at her wedding and Toby, being the doormat he is, obliged. After they both, in person, told me they were getting married. After him saying “you and Nigel are the most important people in my life”.  

And here i am, thinking about all the reasons why i am not welcome. Would it be for my stupid adolescent crush on him? But that was 13 years ago… I’m with Charles since forever. Ava saw us. Charles and I were together before they were. She saw me cry for Charles, she saw how I look at him. It just makes no sense. Was it for calling him out at Nigel's party? But we always call each other out when we  go too far. Was it because he did not want Charles at his wedding? Holy moly, that would be shitty since Charles never reciprocated the jerky behavior Toby had towards him. 

But on top of it all, I just cannot understand WHY Toby did not say anything to me. I would have understood, I probably would have laughed it off, but i would have appreciated a little honesty. 


When I realized I had not been invited, i actually laughed it off. But now I am sad, and I don't know if I should ask him why, or ask Nigel, or fuck all this shit entirely.
I am thinking about all our history, and I am mourning with the 12 year old me which lost so much time and suffered so much for this crap. So that’s how a 20-years friendship dies, I guess. With a stupid wedding.

(Pt. 1)","You ever walk into a moment and feel like you just missed something? Like you stepped into a room you’ve known your whole life and suddenly the walls are an inch too far apart, or the light doesn’t land where it used to?

That’s what it felt like that morning. Like the world had slipped a little sideways, and nobody told me.

I’ve lived out here my whole life. Forty-six years on the same stretch of land — red clay soil, dead air in August, sky so wide it makes your ribs ache if you look at it too long. We’ve always had cattle. My parents before me, and now me and Wyatt. My son.

There’s a kind of rhythm you settle into out here. Wake before the sun. Coffee and boots. Let the dog out. Feed the herd. You start to trust that nothing changes fast — not out here. The cows chew, the fences lean, and if something dies, it stays dead and starts to stink.

But on Tuesday, the cows didn’t stink.

They didn’t move either. I walked out with a feed bucket tucked under one arm, half-asleep and annoyed at how cold it still was, and then I stopped. About thirty feet from the pasture gate. Just stopped.

Because something was wrong.

At first, I thought it was just the way they were standing. All five of them — Daisy, Marlow, Tuck, and the two Holsteins we’d never bothered to name — they were just… still. Facing the same direction. Heads low, eyes open.

Frozen like they’d been mid-step and someone hit pause.

It wasn’t until I saw the fourth one collapse that I understood.

Not fall. Not stumble. Collapse — inward. Like the weight inside it just vanished. Like the skin gave up pretending.

It crumpled without sound.

I dropped the feed and went to the fence. My breath caught halfway up my throat. I’ve seen dead livestock. Torn-open by coyotes, bloated from bloat, even one struck by lightning once. None of that scared me the way this did.

They were still upright.

The closest one, Daisy, didn’t react when I got closer. Her eyes didn’t blink. I reached out — slow, trying not to scare myself more than her — and pressed two fingers against her side.

The skin gave. Soft as old leather. No warmth. No pulse. Just a faint smell I didn’t recognize. Sweet. Plastic-sweet. Wrong.

When I pulled my hand back, my glove came away dry. Clean.

I went around and looked at the others. Each the same. No gore, no signs of attack. Just… empty. Like someone had scooped them out and set the hides back up again.

And the sixth one was gone.

I counted three times. We had twelve. There were six now. Five husks, one real, pacing nervously along the far end of the field like it wanted nothing to do with the others.

I checked the fence. No damage. No drag marks in the mud. The latch was still closed — from the inside.

That’s when I started shaking.

I don’t remember walking back to the house. I remember sitting on the porch swing with my boots still on, staring at my gloves like they were going to start whispering. The silence was too loud. You don’t notice it until something inside it is missing.

I tried calling Sheriff Harlan twice before he finally picked up. First time it rang six times and kicked me to voicemail. Second time he answered with a gravel-rough voice and a sigh like I’d pulled him out of a nap.

“Sadie,” he said. “Everything alright?”

“No,” I said. “I think… something’s wrong with the herd.”

I was trying not to sound hysterical, but my voice cracked anyway. I could hear Wyatt in the living room behind me, flipping TV channels without watching them. I didn’t want him to hear me say hollow. Or inside out. Or gone.

“Coyotes, maybe?” Harlan asked. “We had some wander out this way a couple years ago. Got into the Braxton’s goats.”

“Coyotes don’t leave animals standing up,” I said.

“Say again?”

“They’re still standing,” I said, quieter now. “Like they died upright. Like they were… left that way.”

He didn’t speak for a few seconds. I heard something clatter in the background. Keys, maybe. Or a badge.

“Alright,” he said slowly. “I’ll come by around noon. You said five of ‘em?”

“Six,” I corrected. “One of them’s missing. The rest—” I stopped. “There’s nothing inside them, Harlan. Nothing. Like they were emptied out.”

He made a low noise, half-cleared his throat. Didn’t say anything else for a while.

“Stay inside, Sadie. I’ll be there soon as I can.”

I hung up and stood at the window, watching the pasture.

I don’t know what I expected — something crawling, maybe, or movement in the corner of my eye. But the pasture looked still. Too still. The good kind of silence, the rural kind, has birds and wind in it. This was just flat. Like the land had gone deaf.

Wyatt walked up next to me and leaned against the wall, silent for a minute.

“Are they gone?” he asked.

“What?”

“The cows,” he said. “The ones that saw her.”

I felt my spine lock.

“What are you talking about?”

“I told them not to look at her,” he mumbled. “But they always stare.”

I turned to him slowly. He wasn’t looking at me — just out the window, his thumb worrying at the hem of his sweatshirt. His socks were mismatched. His face pale.

“Wyatt,” I said gently. “Who’s ‘her’?”

He shrugged, still not looking at me.

“The one in the barn.”

I didn’t answer him. I didn’t know how. I made him a grilled cheese sandwich and told him he could stay home from school. He didn’t ask why. Just nodded once and went back to the couch like he knew more than I did.

It was only after I’d turned the skillet off that I realized what he said didn’t make sense. He hadn’t been out there. I hadn’t told him about the barn.

Not yet.

Elias came shuffling down the hall an hour later. His slippers dragged on the floor, the way they always did when he was having one of his off days. The kind where he wasn’t quite all here — drifting between the house we live in and the one from thirty years ago. He stopped in the kitchen, squinting like the sun had been following him indoors.

“You leave the back door open again?”

“No,” I said. “I never opened it.”

He scratched at the side of his neck. The skin there was papery and loose, and he always scratched when he was anxious. Then he smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes.

“Just checking,” he said. “Don’t want her getting angry.”

Something in me tensed.

“What did you say?”

“What?” he said. Then, “I didn’t say anything.”

I checked the barn before Harlan arrived.

The spiral was there.

It hadn’t been yesterday — I was sure of it. The doors were warped and sun-faded and bore the usual dents and scratches. But now, dead center of the left door, there was something new. A mark.

It wasn’t drawn. Wasn’t scratched. It looked pressed into the wood — not burned, not carved. Almost like it had always been there but only now revealed itself. Perfect spiral. Five rings wide. No smudge, no ash, no tool marks.

When I looked too long, my vision throbbed at the edges.

I turned away and closed the barn.

Didn’t lock it.

Harlan showed up around noon, just like he said. Dust trailing behind his cruiser like a second shadow. He stepped out chewing the end of a toothpick, squinting up at the house.

“Sadie,” he said. “How bad is it?”

I took him around back and showed him the remains.

Or whatever you’d call them.

They weren’t even intact anymore. Sometime between morning and noon, two more had folded in on themselves. Their hides lay like tarps tossed over collapsed camping tents. Harlan walked a slow circle around them, squatting beside one of the Holsteins. He didn’t touch it.

“Jesus,” he muttered.

He straightened up and took a step back. Then another. Pulled a bandana from his back pocket and pressed it to his face.

“What the hell happened here?”

“I was hoping you’d tell me.”

“I’ve never seen anything like this.”

“Coyotes?” I asked, almost sarcastically.

“Not unless they got real neat with their table manners.”

We stood there in silence for a while.

“Vet coming out?” he finally asked.

“She won’t,” I said. “Not after I told her what I saw.”

He nodded, slow. Then rubbed at his jaw and said:

“Sadie… you ever hear stories about this land?”

Harlan didn’t say much else while he was here. He walked a few slow circles around the corpses — or hides, I guess — scratched something in a little black notebook, and then stared long and hard at the spiral on the barn.

He asked me if Wyatt had seen it. I said no. He asked again if anyone else had been on the property. I said not unless they flew in and floated over the fence.

He didn’t laugh. He just nodded once, tapped his pen against the notebook, and told me to “keep the boy inside tonight.”

As if I needed the reminder.

Before he left, he stood at the edge of the gravel and looked back at me like he was debating something.

“You ever hear about the old quarry?” he asked.

“Sure,” I said. “My dad used to take me fishing near it when I was a kid.”

“Not that one,” he said. “I mean the first one. The one they filled in before the war. East of the ridge. You can’t even see it anymore, not unless you’re up high.”

“No,” I said slowly. “Why?”

He scratched behind his ear. Seemed irritated he’d even brought it up.

“Nothing. Just… they used to say things walked out of there. After dark.”

“Things?”

“Like shadows. But heavier.”

I didn’t know what to say to that. Neither did he, apparently, because he tipped his hat and got back in the cruiser.

“Call me if it happens again,” he said, before slamming the door shut.

It didn’t wait until morning.

That night, I locked every door and window. Drew the curtains. Left the porch light on even though I knew it wouldn’t matter. Light doesn’t keep things out if they’ve already gotten in.

Elias went to bed early, muttering about “her” again. I didn’t press him. I gave Wyatt an extra blanket and left a lamp on in his room. I figured he was afraid, too.

But when I went to check on him around midnight, he was sitting cross-legged on his bed, facing the wall. The lamp had been unplugged.

There were drawings all around him — dozens. Crayon, pencil, whatever he could get his hands on. Spirals. Tall shapes. Things with too many fingers. Cows with hollow eyes. And one that chilled me more than the rest:

A drawing of our house, from the field. In the window, a tall figure. No face. Just black where the features should be.

“Wyatt,” I whispered. “Where did you get these?”

He didn’t look at me.

“She told me to.”

“Who did?”

“The one from the barn. The one you tried to lock out.”

“I didn’t lock—”

But I had. I had locked the barn. I remembered it clearly.

Yet when I checked the next morning, the door was wide open.

The hides were gone.

All of them.

No bones. No fur. Just five deep indentations in the soil, and one long drag mark that led straight to the treeline. It ended abruptly about ten feet in, where the pine needles had been swept into a strange formation — a rough spiral, pressed into the forest floor.

I didn’t walk any further. My chest was tight. My teeth ached. I felt like if I took another step, I’d never find my way back.

Elias stopped talking that morning.

He just sat in the armchair by the window, staring out at the fields. His mouth opened once like he was going to say something, but nothing came out. When I brought him his tea, he wouldn’t look at me.

There was a small scrap of paper in his lap — shaking fingers clutching it like it was the only thing he remembered how to do.

It was another drawing.

But not from Wyatt. Elias didn’t draw anymore — not since the stroke.

This one was different. Older. Torn from a ledger or a notebook. And the shape on it made my stomach turn.

A barn.

Ours.

And beneath it, something moving — a black sketch of legs, long and backward-bent, reaching down into the soil.

I don’t know how to explain this in a way that makes sense.

The thing I keep thinking about — the part that gets louder the longer I sit with it — is this:

The cows didn’t die lying down.

Something let them stay upright. Something took the time.

And whatever it is, it doesn’t kill the way we understand.

It hollows.

Not newly formed, just newly freed to front. We know who responds to weed, how switches feel with weed, all of that. It's just part of our everyday. 

The past 3 days we have been drinking coffee for the first time in our life. Shouldn't have the stuff, messes with/spikes our anxiety and heart rate, but someone inside said, ""Fuck it, why does everyone else get to be up and we always have to dull ourselves down?""

The littles are overstimulated without question and the anxiety/heart rate issue is still there, but we just feel so...UP and good and like we never need to eat anymore so it feels worth it (eating/food issues are so awful with OSDD, we need to talk about that more. We'll sometimes switch mid bite and suddenly we're spitting out our food and feeling disgusted while simultaneously looking like a rude fool to anyone around. so terrible).

I have a situation where I have a high job offer including a 38% increase to my current base, plus a yearly bonus, stock options (it is quite a good stock & publicly traded. I'm an engineer but not in software, I can explain on this more if needed), 50% 401k match (!!) and misc benefits like free lunch/dinner/coffee in Sillicon Valley (San Jose, CA). If I'm comparing TC it is a 67% increase to my current TC. I currently make a little more than the average HHI in a M/LCOL area in NC; I'm in a medium-sized city an hour outside Charlotte. I'm in my mid 20s, unmarried but with a long term partner who I split expenses with, and don't plan on buying a house for a few years out.

I absolutely would appreciate the lifestyle the job in CA would offer, I highly value the opportunity to live in a city and walk to work, and I've poked around and found rents for a decent 2b2b apartment in the $2700 range; I currently rent a 3b2b townhouse for $2000 so the housing increase isn't that bad, and of course I'd be spending less in food.

To me, it seems like a so much better offer for my specific situation but I just wanted to check if I'm missing something? Renting costs are surpingly NOT that much more expensive in Silicon Valley vs my current medium sized area, though I know home buying in CA is likely out of the picture, but I accept that. Taxes might be a bit higher in CA but not too much so vs NC. So I guess I'm just wondering, is there anything else that would be that much more expensive in VHCOL?",0,1749688736.0,personalfinance,2,0.33,False

*A story that will shatter everything you think you know about other people*

---

I used to live in a city full of NPCs.

You know the type. Zombies shuffling to Starbucks. Robots reciting small talk. Empty shells scrolling phones with dead eyes.

""How's the weather?""
""Living the dream!""
""TGIF!""

Same scripts. Same vacant stares. Same soul-crushing predictability.

I was the only real person in a simulation of humans.

Or so I thought.

---

Then I met Sarah at the grocery store.

She was scanning items with the mechanical precision of every other cashier drone. But something made me actually look at her.

Really look.

Her name tag was crooked. Her mascara was slightly smudged. Her smile flickered for just a microsecond when she thought no one was watching.

""How are you today?"" she asked in that rehearsed retail voice.

But this time, instead of my usual grunt, I stopped.

I looked into her eyes.

""Honestly? I'm terrified I'm wasting my life. How are you?""

---

The mask cracked.

Her robotic smile melted into something raw and real.

""I... I paint at night,"" she whispered, glancing around like she was confessing a crime. ""Terrible paintings of things that don't exist. I've never told anyone that.""

In that moment, the NPC dissolved.

Standing before me was a universe. A complete, infinite, sovereign consciousness who painted impossible worlds in her tiny apartment after eight hours of pretending to be a cashier.

---

I became obsessed.

Not with Sarah. With the experiment.

What if they weren't NPCs? What if I was just looking through a dirty mirror?

---

I started polishing.

Every interaction became a cleaning cloth. Every annoying conversation, a chance to wipe away another layer of my own assumptions.

The businessman on the train who only talked about quarterly reports? I asked him what he dreamed about as a kid.

Turns out he wanted to be a marine biologist. Still did. He showed me photos of jellyfish he took on weekends, tears in his eyes.

The ""basic"" girl at the coffee shop who only posted selfies? I complimented her photography.

She lit up. Told me about the stories she wrote for each photo. Entire mythologies hidden behind duck faces and latte art.

---

One by one, the NPCs vanished.

In their place: gods in disguise. Universes pretending to be people. Infinite consciousness wearing human costumes so convincing they'd fooled themselves.

---

But here's the part that broke my brain:

**They weren't the ones who were asleep.**

**I was.**

Every ""NPC"" I saw was just my own unconsciousness reflected back at me.

Every boring conversation was my own inability to be present.

Every dead stare was my own disconnection from life.

Every empty interaction was my own emptiness, projected outward.

---

The mirror wasn't showing me them.

It was showing me me.

---

Now I polish mirrors for a living.

Not actual mirrors. Perception mirrors.

I help people see that the world they're experiencing is the world they're creating.

That the NPCs in their life are just dusty reflections of their own sleeping consciousness.

That the moment you truly wake up and see clearly...

Everyone else wakes up too.

---

**The shocking truth they don't want you to know:**

There are no NPCs.

There never were.

There's only you, looking at yourself through 8 billion different mirrors.

Some are clean. Some are dirty.

But they're all showing you the same thing:

**Who you really are.**

---

Stop trying to wake up other people.

Start polishing your mirror.

The world will change the moment you see it clearly.

---

*What if everyone in your life is just consciousness wearing a different costume?*

*What if the person annoying you most is your greatest teacher?*

*What if you're not surrounded by NPCs, but by gods playing hide-and-seek?*

**Look again.**

Julian’s mornings were like his handwriting: neat, intentional, and just slightly trembling from too much overthinking. He came to the café every Tuesday — always 9:30 AM sharp, always a black Americano, no sugar. It was his corner in a loud, uncertain world.

The universe didn’t ask for his permission when it shattered the routine.

It was 9:47 AM when the door jingled violently and a girl rushed in — all messy hair, oversized mustard hoodie, and the chaotic grace of a minor hurricane. She wasn’t looking. Her elbow collided with his table.

The cup teetered. Then tumbled. Hot coffee exploded all over his notes.

“Oh my God!” she gasped, her voice panicked. “I’m so sorry!”

Julian blinked at the mess. Then at her.

“It’s fine,” he muttered, grabbing napkins. “It’s just… third-degree burns on my ego.”

She laughed — short, nervous, musical.

“I’ll pay for your drink. And your... dignity.”

“I don’t think it’s for sale,” he said. Then added, without thinking: “But the coffee is appreciated.”

They cleaned in awkward tandem. Fingers brushed. Eyes met.

She introduced herself. “Rina.”

“Julian.”

They didn’t exchange numbers. Didn’t follow each other on Instagram. Just names. A brief smile. And the barista, Toby, who witnessed the entire event, raised an eyebrow.

“No sparks, huh?” he teased later.

Julian shrugged. “Just coffee.”

But it wasn’t.

Not really.

Part 2: The Sanctuary Rule
She returned the next week. Same time, same messy hair, same loud entrance. She ordered a complicated drink — iced mocha, two pumps hazelnut, extra shot, no whip — and slid into the seat across from Julian like it was the most natural thing in the world.

“No apologies today,” she said. “I didn’t spill anything.”

“I’m already impressed.”

Over time, something unspoken formed between them. No rules were declared out loud, but there was a rule:

They only existed in the café.

Not as a couple. Not even as friends with benefits. Just… two people who met in the same corner every week. No texting. No calling. No following up if someone didn’t show up. The café was their sanctuary — a place outside of everything else.

Julian found it comforting. So did she.

“You know what I like about this?” she said once, sipping her ridiculous coffee.

“What?”

“We’re ghosts out there. But here, we’re… real.”

Julian looked up from his sketchpad. “Ghosts?”

“Yeah. Outside, no one expects anything from each other. No pressure. No drama. Just the present.”

He nodded slowly. “Sanctuary rule.”

She smiled. “Exactly.”

Toby learned their rhythm quickly. He started preparing Julian’s coffee without asking. Rina’s drink, too, once he remembered all the tweaks.

“You two should just date,” he muttered once.

Julian just smirked. “Not part of the rule.”

Part 3: Tangled Silences
They didn’t talk every second. Sometimes they just shared space — sketching, scribbling, doodling on napkins, reading from separate books but leaning just close enough that their elbows touched.

Rina once drew tiny cartoons on the edge of Julian’s planner — a stick figure tripping over a spilled cup of coffee. Underneath: “Plot twist: the universe ships us.”

He laughed out loud when he saw it days later.

Their connection was a soft hum. Not the loud kind that demands attention, but the type that lingers in your skin long after the music ends.

One rainy Tuesday, the café played a song Julian had never heard before. Guitars, soft harmonies, and a haunting line:

""May multo sa alaala...""

Rina looked up suddenly. Her smile faltered.

“What’s wrong?” Julian asked.

She shook her head. “Nothing. Just... beautiful, di ba?”

She didn’t explain.

He didn’t ask.

But that song kept playing every now and then. And every time, something in her dimmed slightly — like a memory too heavy to name.

Part 4: Fragile Threads
Time passed in coffee cups and quiet moments. They learned each other’s habits. Julian bit his straw when he was thinking. Rina twirled her spoon when anxious.

Then slowly, things shifted.

Rina began checking her phone more often. She would excuse herself to answer calls. Sometimes, she wouldn’t touch her drink until it had watered down completely.

“You okay?” Julian asked one morning.

She smiled too quickly. “Yeah. Just… life, you know.”

And because of the sanctuary rule, he didn’t push. They never spoke of what was outside.

But it was changing her. And him.

The day she didn’t show up, Julian assumed she was late. He waited an hour. Ordered both their drinks.

Still, nothing.

The next Tuesday, he came again. Nothing.

He stared at the seat across him like it owed him an explanation.

He thought about messaging her — he had her number from a rare moment they exchanged emergency contacts — but his thumb hovered over it and froze.

The rule.

She could break it. But he wouldn’t.

That was their deal.

So he waited.

And waited.

And waited.

Part 5: Ghosts in the Corner
Julian kept coming back. Every Tuesday.

Toby noticed.

“Still no sign?” he asked softly one morning.

Julian just shook his head.

“She didn’t tell you anything?”

“Not outside here,” Julian said. “That was our... line.”

Toby hesitated. “You want her usual?”

Julian looked at the menu. He hadn’t ordered it in months. But he nodded.

“One iced mocha, two pumps hazelnut, extra shot, no whip.”

Toby raised a brow. “Matagal na rin hindi na-order ’yan.”

Julian said nothing.

When the drink came, it looked lonely in its plastic cup. He placed it across the table — in her spot — and stared at it like it might shimmer into a girl in a yellow hoodie.

The song played again.

""May multo sa alaala...""

Julian looked around. Everything felt like an echo.

It became a ritual — order her drink once a month. Let it sit across him. Pretend she was late again.

He memorized the way the straw curved. The sound of the ice settling. Her laugh in the corner of his mind.

He didn’t cry.

But he didn’t move on either.

Part 6: The Barista’s Casual Goodbye
Two years later, Julian returned after a long work trip. He hadn’t been to the café in months. It was quieter now. The seats reupholstered. A few new faces behind the counter.

But Toby was still there — older, a little slower, but familiar.

Julian stepped up to the counter and smiled faintly.

“One iced mocha,” he said. “Two pumps hazelnut, extra shot, no whip.”

Toby paused mid-reach.

“Matagal na rin hindi na-order ’yan,” he murmured. Then added, “Memory lane?”

Julian nodded.

Toby made the drink. When he handed it over, his voice dropped. “Sayang. Wala na si Rina.”

The cup trembled slightly in Julian’s hand. “What?”

Toby looked at him gently. “Car accident. Months after she stopped coming. Yung kaibigan niya, minsan dumaan dito. I asked… ayun.”

Julian sat down slowly.

The café was the same, but the air had changed. It felt heavier.

The cup sat in front of him. Just like before. Only this time, he knew she’d never come through the door again.

The song played. That same one.

""Multo sa alaala…""

He finally understood.

She had become exactly what she described — a ghost outside the sanctuary. But now, even inside, she was just a memory.

He thought of all the times he could’ve called. Messaged. Asked.

But he didn’t.

Because the rule mattered.

Or maybe because he was too afraid of breaking something sacred.

He stared at the drink. Then took a sip.

It was too sweet.

Too cold.

Too empty.

And still — he held it like it meant everything.

Ending Note
He came back every year.

Same table.

Same drink.

Same silence.

Not waiting anymore.

Just remembering.

Because in their sanctuary, Rina never truly left.

Only... drifted.

Like steam from a paper cup.

Her desire to be this passenger-princess, valley girl, basic B is so cringe. I know this is really offensive to say about anyone in general, but GURL YOU ARE NOT GOOD LOOKING ENOUGH TO HAVE THESE PERSONALITY TRAITS (not that anyone should have them obv). What fantasy world are you living in where you think you’re above doing basic adult things?!! 
“I’m just a girl”. The nerve of her to think that it’s only her husband’s job to fill up gas. No wonder he always looks miserable in her videos because she constantly acts like an idiotic child. This is just the tip of the iceberg with her. The list of her annoying habits is endless:

1) never shutting up about her coffee addiction
2) her fixation with her “cute” coffee cups when they are in fact very average, ugly looking cups.
3) shoving the camera in her child’s face any chance she can. Also handing him a sugary snack every chance she can is irresponsible (a snow cone followed by cotton candy, followed by gum, etc)
4) wearing clothes way too tight for her
5) not being transparent about her nose job
6) acting like a bratty spaz when Omar secretly films her eating. Yea I understand he’s filming you with your guard down, but at least have a mature reaction! Instead, she scowls and moans/complains as if she’s a 10 yr old complaining to her mom that her older brother is picking on her!

Anyways back to the whole gas debacle. HOMEGURL, IT IS YOUR EFFING FAULT THAT YOU DRENCHED YOUR SHOES IN GASOLINE!! When you take the nozzle out of the car, make sure you’re not still pulling on the lever you moron! But nooooo instead she’s going to play victim and drive all the way home feeling like the worst thing in the world happened to her.

In the vibrant and bustling atmosphere of Washington, unexpected adventures can transform a day with “nothing planned” into a cherished memory. Exploring the capital without a strict itinerary allows for spontaneity and discovery, forging unforgettable experiences that are often more rewarding than meticulously planned ones.

Start your day in a park, where the aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. Stroll through the gardens of the National Mall, where iconic monuments stand as testaments to history and freedom. Take a moment to feel the grass beneath your feet and soak in the serene environment—a perfect backdrop for impromptu conversations and laughter with friends or family.

Next, wander into one of Washington’s lesser-known neighborhoods. Adams Morgan or U Street offers colorful street art, quirky shops, and inviting cafes. Stop by a local eatery, where the menu reflects the city's melting pot of cultures, and indulge in a delightful dish you’ve never tried before. This culinary adventure could easily become the highlight of your trip.

As the day unfolds, allow yourself the freedom to follow your instincts. A chance encounter with a street performer might inspire you to join in the fun, or an unexpected invitation to a local festival could lead to an evening filled with music and dancing. These random moments often turn into the stories you’ll recount for years to come.


Visit an art gallery you’ve never heard of.
Chat with locals for insider tips on hidden gems.
Take a spontaneous photo to capture the joy of the moment.


Ultimately, Washington surprise delight thrives on the unexpected. By embracing the unplanned, you’re likely to create your favorite memory that stays with you long after you leave this dynamic city.

1l98hmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l98hmh/my_29m_boyfriend_31m_discussed_intimate_details/,My [29M] boyfriend [31M] discussed intimate details about our sex life with his mom [59F],"My boyfriend [31M] and I [29M] have been together for about 4 years. We have a relationship that incorporates kink pretty heavily - I am his Dominant and he is my submissive. It’s not 24/7 total power exchange, but we have significant periods of fully living within power exchange dynamics, and I think a lot of what we do would be considered pretty extreme by a lot of people. But it's what we're both into, and it feels like more than just sex; it feels very meaningful due to the amount of trust, devotion and care required of both of us.

The other day I got a message from his mom [59F] out of the blue, basically saying she knows her son is abusing me and she wants to help me leave the relationship. I was extremely confused and kind of assumed it was some weird tactic to get me to break up with him, as she has made comments to him before encouraging him to break up with me and comparing me to his ex girlfriend. So I just told her I appreciate the concern, but he's good to me and we're very happy together.

When I got home from work, my boyfriend was losing his mind. His mom had been phoning and messaging him all day, calling him a criminal, a disgusting pervert, sick in the head, saying she was going to contact the police and tell his work what he had done. He was convinced his mom had found out about our D/s dynamic, but I didn't get why that would be the case - nobody ever assumes that a submissive is inherently abusive towards their Dominant, so why would she be calling him an abuser? I was sure there was some other explanation, and eventually he admitted he had told her intimate details about our relationship.

He said she had come round for coffee and he had accidentally made an offhand comment about some part of our relationship, and then felt so awkward about it that he just kind of kept talking. She didn't make any judgmental comments but asked him questions about it, so he got our contract and my journal for her to look through. This journal contains a lot of extremely explicit and extremely personal details - it's where I keep all my notes about my boyfriend's hard and soft limits, likes and dislikes, scene planning and summaries. It's basically a catalogue of our D/s dynamic and our sex life. Maybe she assumed either that my boyfriend wouldn't show her someone else's private journal, or that because I'm physically smaller and fairly feminine I had to be playing the submissive role in this dynamic, but either way she got the impression that my boyfriend was the Dominant partner and that I was in danger.

I was initially really worried that I'd done something wrong and made my boyfriend feel uncomfortable or unsafe for him to talk to his mom about it, but he assured me that it literally was just that he felt awkward and over-explained. He’s now freaking out about the possibility of her contacting his work with intimate details of our sex life, as he's a teacher so it could be really bad. She has also told his sister and dad about it, and they're now also accusing him of doing really vile things to me.

I really feel for him and I'm really angry and upset on his behalf, as he's always tried so hard to please his mom and now it almost feels like she's trying to ruin his life. But at the same time I'm so, so angry at him. I have no idea why on earth he would tell his mother of all people about any of this, but I especially don't understand why he would show her my journal. It's not even something I let him look at unless I have a specific reason to, so it feels like such a massive violation of trust and privacy that he would show it to anyone, nevermind his mom. I also just find it really off-putting that he would talk to his mom about this in the first place, as it feels so inappropriate to me. 

I've tried to talk to him about how betrayed I feel, but it's like all the trust and understanding we've built up has just disappeared because he's so anxious and upset right now, and he won't listen to me at all. He just wants me to phone his mom to explain, which I really don't want to do, as I really don't want to have to talk to a woman who already dislikes me about how nasty I'm fucking her son. So how do I support him with this while I'm still feeling so hurt - do I just swallow my feelings and phone his mom to explain? What am I even supposed to feel about this?

TL;DR My boyfriend gave his mom my journal full of details about our sex life; I am unsure how to balance supporting him with my own feelings of betrayal.",1,1749687184.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

(Pt. 1)","You ever walk into a moment and feel like you just missed something? Like you stepped into a room you’ve known your whole life and suddenly the walls are an inch too far apart, or the light doesn’t land where it used to?

That’s what it felt like that morning. Like the world had slipped a little sideways, and nobody told me.

I’ve lived out here my whole life. Forty-six years on the same stretch of land — red clay soil, dead air in August, sky so wide it makes your ribs ache if you look at it too long. We’ve always had cattle. My parents before me, and now me and Wyatt. My son.

There’s a kind of rhythm you settle into out here. Wake before the sun. Coffee and boots. Let the dog out. Feed the herd. You start to trust that nothing changes fast — not out here. The cows chew, the fences lean, and if something dies, it stays dead and starts to stink.

But on Tuesday, the cows didn’t stink.

They didn’t move either. I walked out with a feed bucket tucked under one arm, half-asleep and annoyed at how cold it still was, and then I stopped. About thirty feet from the pasture gate. Just stopped.

Because something was wrong.

At first, I thought it was just the way they were standing. All five of them — Daisy, Marlow, Tuck, and the two Holsteins we’d never bothered to name — they were just… still. Facing the same direction. Heads low, eyes open.

Frozen like they’d been mid-step and someone hit pause.

It wasn’t until I saw the fourth one collapse that I understood.

Not fall. Not stumble. Collapse — inward. Like the weight inside it just vanished. Like the skin gave up pretending.

It crumpled without sound.

I dropped the feed and went to the fence. My breath caught halfway up my throat. I’ve seen dead livestock. Torn-open by coyotes, bloated from bloat, even one struck by lightning once. None of that scared me the way this did.

They were still upright.

The closest one, Daisy, didn’t react when I got closer. Her eyes didn’t blink. I reached out — slow, trying not to scare myself more than her — and pressed two fingers against her side.

The skin gave. Soft as old leather. No warmth. No pulse. Just a faint smell I didn’t recognize. Sweet. Plastic-sweet. Wrong.

When I pulled my hand back, my glove came away dry. Clean.

I went around and looked at the others. Each the same. No gore, no signs of attack. Just… empty. Like someone had scooped them out and set the hides back up again.

And the sixth one was gone.

I counted three times. We had twelve. There were six now. Five husks, one real, pacing nervously along the far end of the field like it wanted nothing to do with the others.

I checked the fence. No damage. No drag marks in the mud. The latch was still closed — from the inside.

That’s when I started shaking.

I don’t remember walking back to the house. I remember sitting on the porch swing with my boots still on, staring at my gloves like they were going to start whispering. The silence was too loud. You don’t notice it until something inside it is missing.

I tried calling Sheriff Harlan twice before he finally picked up. First time it rang six times and kicked me to voicemail. Second time he answered with a gravel-rough voice and a sigh like I’d pulled him out of a nap.

“Sadie,” he said. “Everything alright?”

“No,” I said. “I think… something’s wrong with the herd.”

I was trying not to sound hysterical, but my voice cracked anyway. I could hear Wyatt in the living room behind me, flipping TV channels without watching them. I didn’t want him to hear me say hollow. Or inside out. Or gone.

“Coyotes, maybe?” Harlan asked. “We had some wander out this way a couple years ago. Got into the Braxton’s goats.”

“Coyotes don’t leave animals standing up,” I said.

“Say again?”

“They’re still standing,” I said, quieter now. “Like they died upright. Like they were… left that way.”

He didn’t speak for a few seconds. I heard something clatter in the background. Keys, maybe. Or a badge.

“Alright,” he said slowly. “I’ll come by around noon. You said five of ‘em?”

“Six,” I corrected. “One of them’s missing. The rest—” I stopped. “There’s nothing inside them, Harlan. Nothing. Like they were emptied out.”

He made a low noise, half-cleared his throat. Didn’t say anything else for a while.

“Stay inside, Sadie. I’ll be there soon as I can.”

I hung up and stood at the window, watching the pasture.

I don’t know what I expected — something crawling, maybe, or movement in the corner of my eye. But the pasture looked still. Too still. The good kind of silence, the rural kind, has birds and wind in it. This was just flat. Like the land had gone deaf.

Wyatt walked up next to me and leaned against the wall, silent for a minute.

“Are they gone?” he asked.

“What?”

“The cows,” he said. “The ones that saw her.”

I felt my spine lock.

“What are you talking about?”

“I told them not to look at her,” he mumbled. “But they always stare.”

I turned to him slowly. He wasn’t looking at me — just out the window, his thumb worrying at the hem of his sweatshirt. His socks were mismatched. His face pale.

“Wyatt,” I said gently. “Who’s ‘her’?”

He shrugged, still not looking at me.

“The one in the barn.”

I didn’t answer him. I didn’t know how. I made him a grilled cheese sandwich and told him he could stay home from school. He didn’t ask why. Just nodded once and went back to the couch like he knew more than I did.

It was only after I’d turned the skillet off that I realized what he said didn’t make sense. He hadn’t been out there. I hadn’t told him about the barn.

Not yet.

Elias came shuffling down the hall an hour later. His slippers dragged on the floor, the way they always did when he was having one of his off days. The kind where he wasn’t quite all here — drifting between the house we live in and the one from thirty years ago. He stopped in the kitchen, squinting like the sun had been following him indoors.

“You leave the back door open again?”

“No,” I said. “I never opened it.”

He scratched at the side of his neck. The skin there was papery and loose, and he always scratched when he was anxious. Then he smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes.

“Just checking,” he said. “Don’t want her getting angry.”

Something in me tensed.

“What did you say?”

“What?” he said. Then, “I didn’t say anything.”

I checked the barn before Harlan arrived.

The spiral was there.

It hadn’t been yesterday — I was sure of it. The doors were warped and sun-faded and bore the usual dents and scratches. But now, dead center of the left door, there was something new. A mark.

It wasn’t drawn. Wasn’t scratched. It looked pressed into the wood — not burned, not carved. Almost like it had always been there but only now revealed itself. Perfect spiral. Five rings wide. No smudge, no ash, no tool marks.

When I looked too long, my vision throbbed at the edges.

I turned away and closed the barn.

Didn’t lock it.

Harlan showed up around noon, just like he said. Dust trailing behind his cruiser like a second shadow. He stepped out chewing the end of a toothpick, squinting up at the house.

“Sadie,” he said. “How bad is it?”

I took him around back and showed him the remains.

Or whatever you’d call them.

They weren’t even intact anymore. Sometime between morning and noon, two more had folded in on themselves. Their hides lay like tarps tossed over collapsed camping tents. Harlan walked a slow circle around them, squatting beside one of the Holsteins. He didn’t touch it.

“Jesus,” he muttered.

He straightened up and took a step back. Then another. Pulled a bandana from his back pocket and pressed it to his face.

“What the hell happened here?”

“I was hoping you’d tell me.”

“I’ve never seen anything like this.”

“Coyotes?” I asked, almost sarcastically.

“Not unless they got real neat with their table manners.”

We stood there in silence for a while.

“Vet coming out?” he finally asked.

“She won’t,” I said. “Not after I told her what I saw.”

He nodded, slow. Then rubbed at his jaw and said:

“Sadie… you ever hear stories about this land?”

Harlan didn’t say much else while he was here. He walked a few slow circles around the corpses — or hides, I guess — scratched something in a little black notebook, and then stared long and hard at the spiral on the barn.

He asked me if Wyatt had seen it. I said no. He asked again if anyone else had been on the property. I said not unless they flew in and floated over the fence.

He didn’t laugh. He just nodded once, tapped his pen against the notebook, and told me to “keep the boy inside tonight.”

As if I needed the reminder.

Before he left, he stood at the edge of the gravel and looked back at me like he was debating something.

“You ever hear about the old quarry?” he asked.

“Sure,” I said. “My dad used to take me fishing near it when I was a kid.”

“Not that one,” he said. “I mean the first one. The one they filled in before the war. East of the ridge. You can’t even see it anymore, not unless you’re up high.”

“No,” I said slowly. “Why?”

He scratched behind his ear. Seemed irritated he’d even brought it up.

“Nothing. Just… they used to say things walked out of there. After dark.”

“Things?”

“Like shadows. But heavier.”

I didn’t know what to say to that. Neither did he, apparently, because he tipped his hat and got back in the cruiser.

“Call me if it happens again,” he said, before slamming the door shut.

It didn’t wait until morning.

That night, I locked every door and window. Drew the curtains. Left the porch light on even though I knew it wouldn’t matter. Light doesn’t keep things out if they’ve already gotten in.

Elias went to bed early, muttering about “her” again. I didn’t press him. I gave Wyatt an extra blanket and left a lamp on in his room. I figured he was afraid, too.

But when I went to check on him around midnight, he was sitting cross-legged on his bed, facing the wall. The lamp had been unplugged.

There were drawings all around him — dozens. Crayon, pencil, whatever he could get his hands on. Spirals. Tall shapes. Things with too many fingers. Cows with hollow eyes. And one that chilled me more than the rest:

A drawing of our house, from the field. In the window, a tall figure. No face. Just black where the features should be.

“Wyatt,” I whispered. “Where did you get these?”

He didn’t look at me.

“She told me to.”

“Who did?”

“The one from the barn. The one you tried to lock out.”

“I didn’t lock—”

But I had. I had locked the barn. I remembered it clearly.

Yet when I checked the next morning, the door was wide open.

The hides were gone.

All of them.

No bones. No fur. Just five deep indentations in the soil, and one long drag mark that led straight to the treeline. It ended abruptly about ten feet in, where the pine needles had been swept into a strange formation — a rough spiral, pressed into the forest floor.

I didn’t walk any further. My chest was tight. My teeth ached. I felt like if I took another step, I’d never find my way back.

Elias stopped talking that morning.

He just sat in the armchair by the window, staring out at the fields. His mouth opened once like he was going to say something, but nothing came out. When I brought him his tea, he wouldn’t look at me.

There was a small scrap of paper in his lap — shaking fingers clutching it like it was the only thing he remembered how to do.

It was another drawing.

But not from Wyatt. Elias didn’t draw anymore — not since the stroke.

This one was different. Older. Torn from a ledger or a notebook. And the shape on it made my stomach turn.

A barn.

Ours.

And beneath it, something moving — a black sketch of legs, long and backward-bent, reaching down into the soil.

I don’t know how to explain this in a way that makes sense.

The thing I keep thinking about — the part that gets louder the longer I sit with it — is this:

The cows didn’t die lying down.

Something let them stay upright. Something took the time.

And whatever it is, it doesn’t kill the way we understand.

It hollows.

I recently looked up on Chat GPT to see what foods and drinks affect oral minoxidil efficacy and it says coffee is one of the reasons . The theory is that coffee blocks adenosine receptors competitively preventing minoxidil from attaching to adenosine receptors and working  through intracellular pathways . Although minoxidil has other ways to improve hair growth like opening potassium channels, vasodilation and so on, coffee does seem to reduce a little of minoxidil’s efficacy .

The meet was was two hours, but apparently that is nothing when you get really worked up about something XD. I was so busy taking pictures of other's dolls I forgot to take mine so I snapped the gang I brought later. Minus my Kirill because I did not feel like unboxing him again. Once I realized how many people I knew where going to be there I was fine bringing the crew (some of them anyway. This hobby is neck deep in my pockets TwT).

In the pictures:

1 - My gang: Supiadoll Tan Hayul (seated), Myou Doll Coffee Lingwei, Myou Doll Tan Lingwei, Xaga Doll Normal Mini Rohee. Only their dresses and his coat are by me, the rest is sourced from ACBJD.

2 - Ringdoll Xie Lian - His Highness Who Pleased the Gods (Fullset) 

3 - This is one of the older Volks Custom Choice dolls, I cannot for the life of me remember which combination her owner gave me! I do know that they had her face repainted so this is not the company face up and the face sculpt is no longer sold I believe.

4 - These two are Ai Dolls, which they started selling at the 2nd in Charles in the area apparently! left is the Marigold and the right is the Black Baccara.

# Review

*Thing is…I thought I knew him \[the Doctor\] mum. I thought him and me were… And then he goes and does this.* – Rose

I don't care about Christmas. I didn't grow up celebrating it, and while I've had friends who loved it, that never really rubbed off on me.

Anyway, welcome to *Doctor Who's* newest special feature: the Christmas episode. All of which I get to review. Yippee.

In all seriousness, while Christmas holds no emotional significance for me, there is an aspect of Christmas episodes, regardless of television show, that I do actually rather enjoy. I quite enjoy an occasional large helping of sentimentality. Christmas episodes tend to be giant piles of sentiment, so in a weird way, I actually do tend to like them. I just get no emotional pull from Christmas trees, gifts under the tree, not to mention that as an American the whole Christmas cracker/paper crown thing feels like an alien culture.

Thing is, ""The Christmas Invasion"" feels like it leans a lot more into the aesthetics of Christmas than the sentimentality. And there's a way that that could work for me as well – run a ""Christmas special"" that's just a normal (if slightly longer than usual) episode with a vague Christmas aesthetic happening in the background. But that's not what's happening either. Instead ""Christmas Invasion"" makes the really weird choice of front-loading some Christmas-themed antics and then spending the rest of the episode on the titular invasion.

Oh and it's also a new Doctor episode. In that case at the very least ""Christmas Invasion"" is following a well-established and historically successful pattern. ""Christmas Invasion"" takes its cues from [*Spearhead from Space*](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/13jm92h/everythings_shiny_and_newand_made_of_plastic_and/) and [*Castrovalva*](https://reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cwu6tx/simplicity_is_the_cure_castrovalva_review/). Like in those stories a considerable amount of time is spent with the Doctor out of commission due to the effects of the regeneration, only for the Doctor to become more active later in the story.

But I think in doing this writer/showrunner Russell T Davies missed *why* that worked for previous stories. Both *Spearhead* and *Castrovalva* were four part stories, roughly the length of a modern two parter. And they both had a lot to do. *Spearhead* had to introduce Liz, as well as reintroduce the Brigadier and UNIT and show how these elements were going to work in a new *status quo*. *Castrovalva* had its characters already introduced, but used its first two episodes to show Nyssa and Tegan really getting to know each other and learning to work together, as they hadn't really interacted much in [*Logopolis*](https://reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cpvmad/entropy_will_take_us_all_logopolis_review/). In theory ""Christmas Invasion"", despite being shorter, has an equivalent to that sort of thing: Rose dealing with the fallout of the Doctor's changing face and personality. In practice though that's something that doesn't really work without the Doctor being an active participant. RTD tries by having Rose, along with Mickey and Jackie take care of the Doctor while feeling abandoned, but what this really amounts to is a new Doctor episode…without the new Doctor getting a chance to really establish himself.

Okay, to be fair the 10th Doctor does in fact get to establish his new personality in the episode's third act. In fact in watching this episode for review I did find myself enjoying David Tennant's first proper scene as the Doctor aboard the Sycorax ship a lot more than I expected. That scene is just brilliantly put together. It's been established (well Rose guesses and she happens to be right) that the TARDIS translation circuit is somehow tied into the Doctor. And throughout the episode we've been getting the Sycorax's words translated to us via a man with a tablet that has some software to translate alien languages (yes we had that in 2006, just accept it). And then, all of a sudden, the Sycorax leader's words suddenly start sounding like English. And then they are English. And then the Doctor steps out of the TARDIS.

And in that first scene David Tennant absolutely own the room. I'm not the biggest 10th Doctor fan, but one of the key things required of any actor playing the Doctor is presence. You've got to be able to own the room. And David Tennant, in pajamas and a bathrobe, absolutely owns the room. We'll ignore for a second that he's apparently immune to the Sycorax energy whip thingy (seriously, how? Is that a regeneration thing? Are Time Lords just immune? Why?) and just point out that this scene does a pretty substantial amount of work showing us who the new Doctor is. That in spite of the fact that, in a pretty neat take on regeneration, the 10th Doctor is pretty insistent that he doesn't really know who he is yet. But he's talkative, chippy, irreverent and quick on his feet. It's actually a great introductory scene, one that does a lot of work to maintain momentum.

And then the episode loses me again. I don't like the swordfight. Mostly because it's badly choreographed (there are swordfights from the black and white era where it looks like people are aiming for each other's swords less than in this one) but also because I don't typically like when *Doctor Who* stories come down to the Doctor performing physical feats to solve the plot, rather than having a clever plan. There are exceptions of course, but it's more fun when the Doctor is clever and as I mentioned previously…the show isn't exactly great at fight scenes regardless. That being said I don't mind the Doctor's hand getting chopped off, him growing a new one (because…regeneration says so) and then declaring that his new hand is ""a fightin' hand"" complete with bad Texas accent and suddenly fighting much better than he had been before. That is the kind of goofiness that I think *Doctor Who* can usually get away with.

But yeah…not fond of the fight scene. So yeah, to this point, the 10th Doctor has been asleep for the majority of his first episode, had one good, but not great scene and engaged in a sword fight. Does he do anything else? Well, yes. First he declares that he doesn't give second chances, and the way it's written and performed suggests that this is supposed to distinguish him from the 9th Doctor. Personally…the 9th Doctor wasn't exactly big on second chances, so this doesn't land for me. And then there's the famous ""six words"" moment…but in order to talk about *that*, I need to give some more context.

The main plot of the episode, such as it exists, focuses on an alien race called the Sycorax and a British space probe sent to Mars called Guinevere 1. The Sycorax take Guinevere 1, take control of everybody with A+ blood in the world thanks to a bit of blood in the probe, then the Doctor wakes up, challenges their leader to a sword fight, wins and the leader (who I should point out remains unnamed through the entire story) takes a very long fall thanks to being a sore loser.

Wow, I did not expect the plot summary to be that short. Normally I don't think I'd have mentioned the A+ blood thing either.

Yeah, there's just not much of a plot here. And that's true to some extent of most new Doctor stories, especially in the revival era where story lengths are generally shorter. But even by those standards this is threadbare. It really doesn't help that the first act of the episode is all about the so-called ""pilot fish"" aliens that came first, dressed up as Santas as a very silly form of camouflage and then weaponized a Christmas tree. Their connection to the Sycorax is tenuous at best, but weirdly they've got the better plot for a new Doctor episode, as they're attracted to the little bits of regeneration energy the Doctor is breathing out. It would be really clever to build a new Doctor episode around the Doctor being chased in a weakened state because of the after effects of regeneration but…no these guys are purely there so that we can have some Christmas-themed nonsense happen before the plot gets started.

In fairness intercut with the pilot fish plot are the early plot points of the Guinevere 1 plot, that allow us to meet a few of the characters involved in that program. None of them are really worth discussing in any detail. They're a perfectly solid group of characters, and each have little moments to shine as either noble or intelligent – I particularly was impressed with Mr. Llewellyn, the Guinevere project director taking responsibility for the his project and putting his life at risk with the Sycorax – but they don't really stand out too much. Still once an alien face is seen on Guinevere's video feed, the Prime Minister gets called in. You know who she is.

Yup, Harriet Jones, last seen helping stop the Slitheen in the [""Aliens of London"" two parter](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1k9k4oc/a_profitable_conspiracy_aliens_of_londonworld_war/) has returned and, as the 9th Doctor said she would, she has been elected Prime Minister. And apparently a good one – or a lucky one – going off of the improvements to Jackie's bank account and the fact that nobody seems to object to calling her era ""Britain's Golden Age"". And throughout this story, Harriet Jones is exactly who you'd imagine she'd be as Prime Minister. Penelope Wilton once again manages to play the character's earnestness and compassion quite well. A bit where she offers Llewllyn some coffee actually mirrors a scene in her first story. Her speech to the nation reminds us that she is still the paragon of Britishness she was before, while having gained more authority. She's straightforwards, no bullshit, but thoughtful and compassionate.

Oh and the humor is working a lot better for her this time. I think it's because there's a disconnect between her being the Prime Minister and a lot of her behavior. She doesn't act like she knows how important she is. Most notable is her running gag of introducing herself with her ID as ""Harriet Jones, Prime Minister"". Which of course gets the standard response of ""yes…I know who you are"" – even the Sycorax know who she is. I didn't find her continually introducing herself with her ID particularly funny in the ""Aliens of London"" two parter, but now when it's a bit absurd that she'd ever bother with it…the running gag just works better.

And all of this makes the ending of the episode hit a lot harder. Throughout the episode we've been hearing about an organization called Torchwood (technically we first heard about them in [""Bad Wolf""](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1kvgun2/the_genocide_games_bad_wolfthe_parting_of_the/)) that might be able to help solve the Sycorax issue. And after the Doctor has gotten the Sycorax to retreat in surrender…Harriet Jones, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, tells them to fire on the retreating ship. RTD was inspired by a couple different things here. The first was Margaret Thatcher's decision to sink the Argentinian ship *Belgrano* during the Falklands War and, like with this instance, the evidence suggests the *Belgrano* was retreating. The second was RTD's disillusionment with then real-life Prime Minister Tony Blair, who he had apparently had high hopes for.

Of course we have to consider the in-universe context here as well. First of all…this is a war crime. Because, yes, it is a war crime to kill enemy combatants who have already surrendered, which the Sycorax had, something that Harriet Jones was aware of since she was there (also…this wasn't a fun thing to research. I mean I was pretty sure this was a war crime but I wanted to double check and…yeah, once you start researching types of war crimes you inevitably run into pretty awful stuff). But we should listen to her reasons, at least to understand it why Harriet Jones would do such a thing. As she points out the Doctor is *not* on Earth all the time, and if he's not around to stop the next invasion, terrible things can happen. The Earth is safest if the Sycorax *don't* go back to the stars and tell the other aliens about the Earth, not to mention the possibility of the Sycorax just…changing their minds. None of that really justifies what Harriet does here, but it does give it a rational backing.

I'm of kind of a mixed mind about writing her to do this though. On one hand…it's a gutsy move by RTD, especially in the otherwise pretty goofy Christmas episode where even the Sycorax are a little silly. It does create a bit of a mood whiplash when the scene immediately after the Doctor and Harriet's confrontation is the Doctor trying on his new clothes to ""Song for Ten"", an upbeat lyrical piece of music composed specifically for this episode. But I don't think that hurts the episode too much. The thing is, Harriet has been presented to this point as being nothing but a decent person. Is this out of character? Or just an example of how when faced with difficult decisions and extreme power even decent people can make choices with terrible consequences. I don't know, but I do appreciate that the episode makes us ask these sort of questions. Harriet Jones did wrong here, even if she will never come to see that.

And it's not like she doesn't get consequences. The Doctor manages to bring down her government in six total words: ""don't you think she looks tired"", said to the PM's aide, and that being after he'd already made her paranoid. This, this is the moment that I think really helps set the 10th Doctor apart as something other than a goofier version of Nine. Like I said the ""no second chances"" moment doesn't really do that, but this is a bit different. It's a lot more calculated than Nine ever was – the 9th Doctor tended towards the more straightforwards approach. And it works…probably a little too quickly, as, as far as I can tell less than 36 hours later there are rumors swirling about Harriet Jones being in ill health and a proposed vote of no confidence. I can believe that those rumors would swirl from the Doctor's words. I can't believe it would happen so quickly, especially with a PM as popular as Harriet Jones was implied to be.

I haven't really talked too much about Rose yet, even though much of the episode is told from her perspective. The thing is…I'm not honestly sure there is a ton to say. The big thing Rose goes through in this episode is being unsure that the Doctor is still the Doctor. Perfectly reasonable reaction to the situation, I don't take any issue with that, especially since Rose still tries to help and care for the Doctor throughout the episode. And of course she does eventually shift into accepting this new incarnation, which in turn helps any audience members having difficulty with the transition, since it was the first for many watching (myself included back when I first watched this episode). The thing is…I'm not entirely sure why the shift happens. It happens when the Doctor makes his grand entrance aboard the Sycorax ship…but Rose just seems to do a complete 180 after the Doctor does this. It's left unclear as to why, and it feels a bit frustrating.

Though maybe it's just because Rose has had a tough time of it to that point, and she'll take anything she can get at that point. Throughout this episode we see Rose trying to take charge in the Doctor's stead. And it does not go well. She does quickly work out that the pilot fish are primarily interested in the Doctor after they attack her and Mickey during Christmas shopping. But while she notices the out of place Christmas tree, the only thing she can do to stop it is ask for the Doctor's help. When the Sycorax invasion comes, in a pretty great scene honestly, Rose can only going into survivalist mode, incapable of actually doing anything. And when she's aboard the Sycorax ship she *does* try to be the Doctor, but is unfortunately incapable of convincing anyone that she knows what the hell she's talking about…because she doesn't. It's not that Rose has a bad episode necessarily, but for her first proper chance to take control of a situation for a lengthy period of time, it does not go well.

I should quickly go over Mickey and Jackie in this episode. Jackie honestly does very little other than annoy the Doctor and prevent him from actually telling her that all he needs is a cup of tea. Yeah, this is not her best episode, in fact I'd say she comes off a bit poorly throughout this one, but honestly she's not a particularly strong presence here. Though I will at least say that we've clearly moved into a place where Jackie is solidly ""team Doctor"" as she's largely on his side throughout, especially noticeable at the end of the episode in that confrontation with Harriet Jones, where, even though she doesn't get any lines, she's positioned as supporting him.

Mickey though…Jesus Christ I thought we fixed this in [""Boom Town""](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1ksdo65/consequences_boom_town_review/). There were hints in ""The Parting of the Ways"" that Mickey was still carrying a torch for Rose, but it's here where we really see that pushed to the forefront. He's really clearly trying to get back with Rose, and while I understand that he's still going to have some sort of feelings for her, it really felt like in ""Boom Town"" he'd at least begun the process of moving on. I think the issue is that, to this point, carrying the torch for Rose is all that Mickey's character is. Well that and hacking, which he does do a little bit of in this episode. Still, we are now well past the point that Mickey's character needed to undergo some sort of a shift and it just hasn't.

What I'm left with at the end of this review is the feeling that ""Christmas Invasion"" lacked focus. Maybe if you have more of an emotional attachment to Christmas as a holiday this does a bit more for you. Honestly though the Christmas hijinks leave very little room for the main plot to get enough time, the 10th Doctor *barely* gets to introduce himself and the villains are pretty forgettable. That being said, the new Doctor does do well in the limited time he gets, Rose gets some interesting material even if it's not perfectly handled and the handling of Harriet Jones, Prime Minister, is complicated but engaging. And that all leaves ""Christmas Invasion"" feeling very middle of the road to me.

**Score: 5/10**

# Stray Observations

* Showrunner Russell T Davies and his Co-Executive Producer Julie Gardner pretty much immediately offered David Tennant the role of the 10th Doctor after Christopher Eccleston told them he'd be leaving the show. RTD and Gardner had previously worked with Tennant on *Cassanova* so they knew his work. Tennant, as a massive *Doctor Who* fan, naturally accepted.
* David Tennant was given a contract for three series by the BBC, in order to avoid a repeat of Christopher Eccleston quitting after just one.
* It's worth pointing out that it wasn't considered a guaranteed thing that *Doctor Who* would continue past Series 1. However the show had its supporters behind the scenes at the BBC, including BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning Julie Tranter (who has been a big part of getting the Revival on air in the first place), and so a second series, along with this Christmas special, were ordered by the BBC.
* So this is our first Christmas special. Saying that comes with an almost contractual requirement to mention ""The Feast of Steven"", part 7 of [*The Daleks' Master Plan*](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/x5jik0/exterminations_time_decay_and_christmas_the/) which not only aired on Christmas and was Christmas themed but also was a pretty severe break in the action of that serial.
* The 10th Doctor speaks in the same Estuary accent as Rose, which was intentional – an earlier version of the script even suggested that Rose effectively imprinted her accent on to the Doctor ""like a chick hatching from an egg"", though this was cut. David Tennant, of course, is Scottish, so natively speaks with a Scottish accent.
* On that note, Showrunner/Writer Russell T Davies wrote this episode as though he were writing for the 9th Doctor, expecting the 10th Doctor's personality to emerge through David Tennant's performance.
* Mickey is first seen in this episode working at a mechanic's shop. I'm pretty sure this is the first time we've seen what he does for a living.
* How is it that Jackie back in the [""Aliens of London"" two parter""](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1k9k4oc/a_profitable_conspiracy_aliens_of_londonworld_war/) realized that the Doctor might not eat human food (I mean she was wrong, but it was a pretty smart thing to think of) but seems completely disbelieving of the fact that the Doctor has two hearts?
* Like the standardization of the regeneration sequence made in ""The Parting of the Ways"", we've added a new thing to regularly occur during recovery from regeneration: the breathing out of weird golden energy thingys. It's neat, I quite like it.
* Mickey offers Rose 20 pounds to get a present for her mother, Rose offering to pay him back later. Um…Rose? How do you think you're going to be able to do that? You don't have a job. The guy you travel with barely ever carries around money from the right planet, let alone the right time and place. Mickey, naturally, cuts through this by calling it a Christmas present. I think he knew he was never getting that 20 quid back.
* Apparently Parliament passed an act banning Harriet Jones' biography. Which…honestly seems a bit extreme.
* Rose explains that the knowledge she had to fly the TARDIS gained in ""The Parting of the Ways"" is now ""forbidden"" in her mind. She further explains that if she tried to use that knowledge again, apparently the Universe would rip in half…that's pretty concerning honestly.
* Apparently, the Doctor can tell specific blood types by tasting the blood.
* The Doctor references Arthur Dent, protagonist of the *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series. Douglas Adams, *Hitchhiker's Guide's* writer, wrote a couple *Doctor Who* serials in the 70s and was the show's Script Editor for [Season 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bxqnzj/murphys_law_doctor_who_classic_season_17_review/).
* We get scenes of the TARDIS wardrobe. This represents the first time in the revival era that we see scenes in the TARDIS from somewhere besides the console room. This is also the last time in Russell T Davies' original run as showrunner that we see scenes in the TARDIS from somewhere besides the console room.
* And to that point, the 10th Doctor's outfit. It's…fine. Thankfully we're firmly out of the JNT era so no more Doctor outfits that look like costumes, and it definitely stands out a lot more than the 9th Doctor's outfit. I don't know though, unlike the 9th Doctor's outfit it doesn't feel like the simplicity of the outfit is the selling point, but it is very simple. I like the long coat, but underneath that it is just a pinstriped suit and necktie. And as for the sneakers…yeah they do nothing for me. It's a fine outfit, but not a favorite of mine.
* So the spaceship breaks up in Earth's atmosphere causing ash to fall to the ground, ash that is mistaken for snow. Wouldn't people figure out pretty quickly that it wasn't snow? I can't imagine ash melts into water if you hold it in your hand, or makes a particularly good snowball for that matter.
* After the episode we get a ""Coming Soon"" trailer, featuring scenes from Series 2 up through the Cyberman two-parter. This mostly does alright for spoilers although the trailer does reveal the return of Sarah Jane and the Cybermen, although in the latter case the episode title will spoil that on its own.
* David Tennant is now credited as ""the Doctor"". Through series 1 Christopher Eccleston, (and David Tennant in ""Parting of the Ways"") were credited as ""Doctor Who"" as had been done until the 5th Doctor era in the classic series. This came by request of David Tennant.

Next Time: On to Series 2 proper, and I guess it's ironic that I'm making a list *after* the Christmas episode",6,1749686488.0,gallifrey,0,0.8,False

Rescued him (Mamby) and his other 2 kitty siblings from the streets. One night, nag quick 🏍️ ride kami ng bf ko for some coffee, then bigla siyang napa-full stop dahil may 3 lil kittens sa gitna mismo ng kalsada nakahiga ayaw umalis! Kahit potpot-an namin😥

Residential road siya and other motorists mabibilis takbo pero iniiwas-iwasan na lang sila. Pero malaki pa rin chance na mapisat talaga sila anytime if ayaw nila umalis.

So tumabi kami and my bf told me baba ako para igilid sila sa sidewalk. I did naman.

But then— these 3 lil kitties kept running back at the middle of the road 💀 (lol, ano ba meron dun?😵‍💫)

The street vendor even helped me put them back on the sidewalk. Kaso makukulit talaga! This bruh (at the pic) pinaka-defensive at siya pa galit na nililipat namin sila sa mas safe na lugar. 😅

Okay hindi na quick yung story hahaha.

Anyways, wala kaming choice ng bf ko kundi i-uwi na sila at i-foster. Kaysa naman daw mamatay sa gitna ng kalsada (which is true)!

So we got them last May 10. And until now they’re here at home, makukulit na parang zoomies 24/7, and all healthy. Inuunti unti na namin sila dinadala sa vet para sa health necessities nila. 🤍

I'm heading east in a few weeks from Los Angeles in my '86 so I would be interested in any ""must sees"" along the way, or if I'm going through your town maybe a coffee meetup with fellow 944'ers.

I'll be taking I40 east all the way over, easier and quicker than non hwy roads so if your too far off the 40 route I don't think it'll happen.

It's an easy 2 day trip so departure date is Monday night June 23rd and I have to be in Springfield MO by Friday June 27th, so I'll have to be selective with when and where I stop.

I'll actually be going to the GOBMC (Greater Ozarks British Motoring Club) for their 25th anniversary show as my landlord in the house I stay in when I'm there has a beautiful 1976 Spitfire so decided to join him and hopefully get some great vintage british iron shots. So if you happen to be going let me know. I usually drive when the sun starts to dip from about 7pm through the night until 9 or 10am the next morning. I've done a 1600 miler in one shot before but it's a little rough so in the mornings I'll pull over, have some breakfast or coffee and nap in the car 4 hrs or so.

I've been lurking on this sub for ages and finally decided to share my experience moving from the US to Portugal. I know there's tons of posts about this but figured I'd add my perspective since I've been here since 2016 and actually work in immigration now (weird how life works out, right?).

So why Portugal? Honestly, I was burned out from the US grind. The weather here is amazing year-round, the healthcare doesn't bankrupt you, and people actually seem to prioritize life over work. Plus the path to citizenship is pretty straightforward 5 years of residency and an A2 Portuguese test. Not gonna lie, that last part was scarier than it sounds but totally doable.

Most people today are looking at the D8 visa (the ""digital nomad"" one). You need to prove you make at least 3,480 euros monthly from remote work, plus have about 10,440 euros in savings. 

The paperwork is... well, it's paperwork. You'll need employment contracts, bank statements, background checks from both the US and Portugal, proof of housing, health insurance, and a Portuguese tax number. Pro tip: get that tax number (NIF) and a local bank account ASAP, even before you move. Trust me on this one.

One thing that trips people up - this isn't a tourist visa extension. You actually need to live here. The rule is you can't be away more than 6 months straight or 8 months total per permit period. If you're planning to bounce around Europe constantly, this might not be the right visa for you.

About taxes - yeah, Portugal will tax your worldwide income once you're a tax resident (usually after 183 days in country). **The old NHR program is gone**, but there are still some benefits for skilled newcomers. Definitely talk to an accountant before making the jump because US-Portugal tax treaties can get complicated.

What I love about living here:

1. It's incredibly safe - I walk around Lisbon at night without a second thought
2. The food is fresh and affordable, plus café culture is real here. You can actually sit and enjoy your coffee without feeling rushed

The downsides are real though. The income requirements (is is net income) exclude a lot of freelancers, rent in Lisbon and Porto has gotten crazy expensive (think secondary US city prices, not cheap backpacker destination), and dealing with AIMA (immigration office) requires the patience of a saint. Also, if you go the citizenship route, expect to wait up to 2 years for processing once you submit everything.

Random tips that would have saved me headaches: open a Portuguese bank account immediately, visit first if you can to set up appointments, keep every single document and receipt (seriously, everything), and start learning Portuguese from day one. Even basic phrases will make your life so much easier and locals really appreciate the effort. There are a lot of english speakers here but the culture is terrific and speaking portuguese will make your journey here much better. 

I know this got long but I remember how overwhelming it felt researching this move 8 years ago. Portugal isn't perfect and the expat life isn't for everyone, but if you want a stable European base with good quality of life, it's hard to beat. Happy to answer questions if anyone has them!

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I have a crush on you. Not an obsession with you, nor a lust for you. I have a child-like, grade school, ""I want to hold hands with you and see if we like each other"" crush.

At least a dozen times I've almost told you. I could say I hesitated because I didn't want to add more useless debris to the swirling storm of your busy life, or that I was afraid that if you knew, you wouldn't feel comfortable reaching out for help in the tumult the come. Both true, but neither comprehensive. 

If I'm honest, many of my reasons for reticence are selfish. Our friendship is important and valuable to me, and anything that might shift it's foundation represents a threat to our shared thoughts of curiosity about the world, our silly ideas and random tangents, and the conversations that celebrate the parts of us that are beautiful and wholly authentic, but which only reveal themselves in the quiet shelter of a kindred mind. Revealing my thoughts would rob me of the comfortable cover of obscurity. There is, of course, also the proverbial potential for finding oneself utterly alone in perspective. And then I haven't even begun to delve into the overarching issue that even if the feeling were mutual, which is itself entirely unlikely, the position it would put us in would be, at best, very complex. 

I can go on forever about why telling you is a bad idea, but none of the reasons make it feel any less like I'm lying to you through omission whenever I feel a little spark and stiffle it, or any time I have wanted to offer you a hug as a friend to someone going through some struggles, but was afraid I would feel the same draw towards you I have stumbled into through our deeper conversations, only to be wracked with guilt for feeling it. I can't tell you, but it's so hard not to when I hear a song you sheepishly sung along to and want to hear your real voice, or when we get excited over some trivial little artistic endeavor, and I want to see you explore the real you behind that brilliant and creative mind. You've mentioned that I can't hide my expressions, and it mortifies me to think that you may already know, or at least suspect.

I know that you'll probably never read this, but if you do, can you tell me how you feel and let me elaborate? And even if we both decide, as we likely would, that it can never go anywhere, can I hold your hand, even just for a little bit? And if not, can we continue to be friends as we are today?

I've been told I'm really intelligent and brilliant. I think quickly and had a lot of skills in technology and performance. I was always called a natural leader. But there's no place in my life where I got to use any of these wonderful skills anymore.

Instead, work makes me feel like a task monkey. Everyone's active, involved and traveling this year except for me. There's no more meetings on my calendar. All people working with me have been cut or fired. My coworker got a promotion, but I was told I have no future here. My boss has ghosted me multiple times for our scheduled coffee chats. This is supposed to be an org about compassion. And all the work I do feels useless right now. Like who cares with everything going on? I just want to quit.

I'm gay and dating is the worst it's ever been. I keep feeling like I'll never find a meaningful relationship. And I'm feeling like more and more men are retreating to hiding and taboo, meaning there's no more authenticity. Only sexualization.

And our society is backwards. We used to care about making people's lives better and innovation. Now, half the country cares about cruelty and I have to witness the effects in real-time.

My dentist rebuilt them with bonding, and told me that I would eventually need crowns when my jaw stopped growing. I got root canals on both sides. Aside from cracking once when I hit a bottle on my tooth, it held up for about 13 years, but got pretty discolored. Towards the tail end, both of them cracked on the back, and chipped a bit on the bottom. I was experiencing mild pain and sensitivity in both teeth. 

Last year I had horrible dental insurance that only covered Aspen and another Aspen-like chain in my area that had similar reviews. I went, they took X-rays, asked me what I didn't like about my teeth, advertised their credit cards and financing. I was told that since both were cracked, I needed crowns. I asked if they could repair bonding, and the dentist said that bonding should never be on teeth for more than 6 months. When I said I didn't have $4k for crowns, and asked about bonding temporarily, she told me to come back when I saved up. They wouldn't even do a cleaning unless I got crowns.

I left, cried in the parking lot, and called the dental schools in my area (quoted me around $2k for crowns). I ended up calling my old trusted dentist who didnt take my insurance at the time. He was fantastic, fixed up both teeth, and charged me $120 cash. I'm so grateful for him.

I did have to hassle the previous clinic to send him my X-rays from the awful appointment, because that would save me from having to pay out of pocket for them. I had to call them about 7 times, his office couldn't get in touch with them, they hung up on me or put me on hold indefinitely many times. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but according to reviews, it seems like a lot of people had similar experiences.

Unfortunately I think the placement of the teeth rebuilt from bonding isn't ideal, they hit my bottom teeth (overbite). They've chipped and cracked on the backs again in the last year. I have new insurance and I live in a new city. I'm so afraid of seeing a new dentist and getting turned away again. I scheduled a visit with a family dentist for about a month from now, and I'm so afraid of a repeat experience with the awful clinic. 

Is it common for dentists to refuse to use bonding on teeth? I understand that cosmetically they don't hold up as well, but I'd rather be pain-free with coffee-stained teeth at the moment.

1l97yxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1l97yxl/a_little_bit_confused_with_deaths_designs_in_the/,A Little Bit Confused With Death’s Designs In The First And Fourth Films,"We’re told if you cheat Death, you will be killed in the order you and others were supposed to die in. The second film is the exception to this rule because the first film’s events had such a ripple effect that Death worked backwards instead (aka new gimmick to trick the audience of the order).

In the first film, though, we see that the explosion would’ve killed (from bottom right to top left) Miss Lewton first, then Carter & Terry, then Billy, Tod & Alex, and Clear. For whatever reason, Death is going in order of:

* The two spots where the fuel line erupted (underneath Tod and Terry’s seats) before the explosion killed them all.

* It’s for whatever reason going by the assigned plane seating order BEFORE Alex even has the premonition, meaning Clear now dies before Alex.

I kind of gave Tod and Terry dying before the others a pass because I assumed the radio or suitcase that hit Tod in the head in the premonition was probably hard enough to kill him. Despite not seeing the radio hit Terry as well, that’s the only thing I can picture making sense. If that’s not the case, why is Death going by order of where the fuel line ruptured?

And Clear dying before Alex doesn’t make sense to me. The premonition is how it WAS supposed to go down, so if Alex swapped seats to be in front of Clear in the premonition, then he would’ve died before Clear did. The only thing I can think of is that Alex unintentionally already dodged Death by being at Clear’s cabin, and it skipped directly to Clear. After Alex prevented Clear’s death, the cycle starts again. Clear got a brief premonition this time to stop Alex from going across the street so Carter could tackle him out of the way, lining him up for the kill. Alex wasn’t next after Clear it was always Carter. 

But I don’t think that’s what the first film, or the fourth film were going on, so I’m confused. Speaking of the fourth film…

In the premonition, cowboy Jonathan Groves moved seats, and therefore died before Janet and Hunt. In reality, because Nick and his friends didn’t ask him to move, he was spared and was only injured.

But for whatever reason, Death skips Jonathan to go after Janet and Hunt. And then after Janet cheats Death again, it jumps back to Jonathan and he dies.

So was the fourth film trying to follow the first film’s pattern of going by order of seating arrangements before they moved, the whole Clear being in front of Alex thing? Because if Nick and friends never asked Jonathan to move, does that mean he would’ve died AFTER Janet and Hunt, but BEFORE George, Lori and Nick? Because if so, like the first film, that doesn’t make sense or keep in line with its pattern/designs.

And then there’s Nick’s second premonition after Jonathan died. George dies, and then Death skips Lori and Nick to start again with Janet, and then back to Lori and presumably Nick. Why did it skip Lori and Nick, and then start the cycle again with Janet?

Outside of cosplay as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things, Leon from Resident Evil along others, I take pride in dressing well, staying active with workouts, and—believe it or not—entering raffles and sweepstakes, which I tend to win more often than I should.

I’m looking to meet a woman who’s into nerdy things, likes to travel, and wants to build a meaningful connection. Cosplay is totally optional—it’s more about sharing good vibes, geeking out, and seeing where things go. A casual coffee would be a great start if you’re local.

Glitches, Mandela effects, whatever — I’ve always just kind of assumed things are what they are. But 11 days ago something happened that has me questioning everything.

I (23M) was at my girlfriend’s (23F) family reunion. The theme was “Farm to Table: Become the Animal.” I wish I were joking. Everyone showed up in farm animal onesies. I tried to be a good sport — wore a chicken suit, brought deviled eggs, smiled through the weird vibes.

Then came her Uncle Greg. He’s in his 60s, used to be a magician, and now apparently considers himself a “spiritual duck medium.” He pulled me aside after dinner and told me, *with absolute seriousness*, “You have duck energy. It’s inside you. Let me pull it out.”

Long story short, I ended up sitting in a kiddie pool full of lukewarm corn water while he chanted in QUACKS and waved a rubber mallard over my head. The entire family circled around me, also quacking. My girlfriend was doubled over laughing and filming it. I stood up, dripping, confused, corn-scented, and left. Drove home alone in my chicken suit.

Here’s where it gets weird:

Since that night, something feels… off. The world feels less stable. Like I’m walking through a copy of a copy of the world I was in before. Time feels slightly *delayed*. Street lights flicker as I pass them. Music skips and repeats on my phone when it shouldn’t. The barista at my regular coffee shop said “QUACK” under her breath when she handed me my drink, and then acted like nothing happened.

I had a dream three nights ago where I was floating on a pond, looking up at a completely still sky, like a paused video. I woke up with my hands folded over my chest like wings.

The kicker? My phone randomly generated a photo slideshow last night titled **“Memories from the Pond”** — and I *never* gave it permission to access or group those images.

I’ve been journaling everything since that night. Either I’m slowly losing it, or something about that duck “ritual” actually did something to my perception of reality. Like it hijacked the event manager and now I’m stuck in a different instance.

I know how insane this sounds. But has anyone else ever felt like a single, absurd moment *broke* something? Like you blinked and now you're in a parallel version where everything is 0.5 degrees off?

I don't know what's real anymore. I’m not entirely sure I ever made it home that night.",55,1749685331.0,SimulationTheory,69,0.77,False

When I was still in university in 2020, I bought myself a MacBook Pro and upgraded the processor to an i7 (in my mind, this could potentially allow me to have this laptop for longer without replacing it). Once I got out of university, I used the laptop for personal use but don't use it as much as I used too, although I still liked having access to one. 

On Friday, my boyfriend was playing videogames and I was watching him. He asked me if he could use my laptop to have a 100% completion list in front of him while playing so he could see it better than on his phone and make it easier to check things off. I said sure and he set it up on the coffee table in front of him. 

We were drinking a bit and he poured us each a vodka shot and placed his in front of my laptop so we could take it together. He went to go check something off the list on my laptop and he accidentally knocked the entire shot onto my laptop. We quickly grabbed paper towel to try and dry it but the entire shot got into the laptop. This was around midnight so I said I'll deal with it tomorrow. 

The next day, I (mind you he didn't come with me for any of this) drove to my nearest Best Buy (25 minutes away) to see if they could fix it. They said no and to try the nearest Apple Store (an additional 50 minutes away). I was able to leave my laptop with Apple and they said it may take almost $1K to fix it based on first glance. I said fine and left it, which my boyfriend initially agreed to pay for.

Two days later, Apple calls me back and says the liquid ended up seeping through to the other side and the damage was pretty extensive ($2,600 to fix) and said it's not worth fixing (I also know Apple is expensive and trying to make money by selling me a new one but I digress). I said not to move forward with the repairs and I would go pick it up the next day. 

My boyfriend felt terrible and through text, he was trying to suggest I bring the laptop back so he could try and salvage some parts from it to sell. I told him the liquid damage was pretty extensive and that nothing would be worth it since I would have had to replace all the main parts (keyboard, touch pad, touch bar, Touch ID, speakers, battery, mother board, etc.). He said it was my decision what to do with it. 

I went to the Apple Store and they brought out my laptop and because they didn't do any repairs, the laptop was still soaked in vodka and would no longer turn on. I asked them if there was anything worth salvaging and they said because it sat in the liquid for days that it was pretty much toasted. I decided to let Apple recycle the laptop. 

Today, I talked to my boyfriend on what I thought was a fair compensation for the accident which was half of the money to replace the laptop with a new one. I know my MacBook was almost 5 years old and not worth the $2,500 I initially paid, so I thought half (around $1,500 for a Pro) would be fair. He said I wasn't being logical when I recycled the laptop and he could have salvaged it for parts to sell and make some money and paying me for half of a new MacBook is ridiculous. I told him it was my decision to make and I decided to recycle it which he thought I chose deliberately so he couldn't take it apart to make some money back. I was baffled at his response and decided to walk away from the conversation before I got even more heated. Am I asking for too much or is my boyfriend just being annoying and stubborn? 

TLDR: boyfriend split his drink on my MacBook Pro and thinks paying for half of a new one is not fair to him. ",47,1749684661.0,AITAH,75,0.96,False

Also, getting chaff out of ground coffee is a PITA, but that's just part of home roasting, I guess.

\--------

I roasted a big batch of coffee, was planning on pre-grinding half at medium grind for someone else with a pressurized basket, and noticed more chaff than I thought a pressurized basket could handle. I figured, ""Why not coarse grind the other half, try to winnow the chaff out, and if I fail, use it to try out double grinding?""

Well I couldn't get much of the chaff out of the coarse grounds because I don't have the right equipment, but I bagged it and waited 2 days, and got a great shot of espresso at the grind setting I usually try first with a FC+ roast (35 clicks on a K6). It tasted good (most important), and didn't have any of the problems associated with trying to make espresso with unrested coffee. The only real difference I noticed between a double grind and a single grind was that the puck responded like the coffee had been ground a couple of clicks finer. No signs of channeling at any point.

What surprised me was how little I felt the puck degrade throughout the shot (Flair Pro 2 lever). I figure double grinding = more fines with fewer boulders, but I expected the puck to degrade faster bc more fines, not slower. The closest I can get to slow feeding the coarse grinds is grinding them one spoonful at a time, I'll try that next and see what happens.",0,1749683888.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

1l97ahc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l97ahc,Mountain Ruins Terrain (Removable 1st Floor for Gameplay!),"Hi all! Here’s a Mountain Ruins terrain piece I built for a friend’s DnD campaign, but I think it would also work great for Warhammer.

One section of the wall and the first floor are removable to allow easy miniature access mid-game. The concept came from a challenge I got from another friend: To make a building that could show damage during play… What do you think ? 

The whole build was super budget-friendly—mostly made from leftover foam, coffee stirrers, and some fake moss I had from left from Easter (cheap Amazon find if anyone’s curious).

Would love your thoughts or feedback!

1l979wx,https://youtube.com/watch?v=lDbWlPk8JKo&si=5IFmz2vp7koeuiRW,08 How to use Polygroup Edit and Subdivide in Unreal Engine 5 6,"# Session 8 Summary – Model Menu: Polygroup Edit & Subdivide Tools

# 🔹 Project Setup

* New project: `polygroup_practice`.
* Created a new level with atmospheric lighting (Sky Light, Directional Light, Sky Atmosphere, Cloud, Fog).
* Switched to **Modeling Mode (Shift + 5)**.

# 🧩 Polygroup Edit Tools

# 🔸 Selection Filters

* Choose to edit **vertices, edges, or faces**.
* Use **edge loop selection** for efficient edge operations.

# 🔸 Core Tools

* **Extrude**: Pulls geometry outward (supports normal-based and even extrusion).
* **Offset**: Offsets faces, especially at corners (90°), with even spacing options.
* **Push/Pull**: Moves geometry **with deletion** or flattening effect (unlike Extrude).
* **Inset / Outset**: Creates inner or outer face boundaries for further modeling.
* **Bevel**: Adds curvature to edges by defining bevel width and subdivisions (curve effect).
* **Delete Faces**: Removes selected faces (can lead to flipped normals).
* **Flip Normals**: Changes the direction of face normals for rendering visibility.
* **Fill Hole**: Closes any open polygon loops or gaps.
* **Insert Edge Loop**: Adds edge loops to control shape and support subdivisions.
* **Cut Faces**: Manually slice geometry for custom face shapes.
* **Duplicate**: Clones a face, often used to construct new sections like roofs.
* **Collapse**: Collapses all selected vertices into one central vertex.
* **Weld**: Merges selected vertices into one.

# 🏛 Modeling Exercise Examples

* **Structure with Pillars**: Used cut face and push/pull to design four-pillar base and a roof with dome effect.
* **Flipped Normals**: Demonstrated face direction effects on visibility.
* **Gopuram-like Roof**: Created with extrude + collapse + weld for vertex merging.

# 🌀 Subdivision Tools

# 🔸 Types of Subdivision

* **Catmull-Clark**:
   * Smooths and rounds geometry heavily.
   * Ideal for organic forms but distorts hard edges.
   * Based on mathematical interpolation of edge loops.
* **Bilinear**:
   * Maintains shape better with even face division.
   * Ideal for mechanical or hard-surface models.
* **Loop Subdivision**:
   * Triangle-based subdivision for specific mesh structures (less commonly used).

# 🔸 Subdivision Control with Edge Loops

* Added **supporting edge loops** to preserve geometry shape during subdivision.
* Example: Created a **coffee cup** model with clean bevels and inside extrusion.

# 🔸 Demo Comparison

* Created three labeled cubes (`sm_cap`, `sm_bilinear`, `sm_catmul`) to visualize:
   * Catmull-Clark (spherical result),
   * Bilinear (retains boxy shape),
   * Loop (optimized triangle pattern).

# ✅ Conclusion

* Covered entire **Polygroup Edit** toolset and **three types of Subdivide operations**.
* Prepped foundation for next session focusing on **Boolean operations** and more **Model menu components**.",1,1749683791.0,u_ssathvick,0,1.0,False

Before you think we're something out of Deliverance, I should clarify. TECHNICALLY it's his step-sister. She came to visit recently and I overheard them ""reminiscing"" about it over coffee. It was early in the morning and I guess they didn't know I was up and quietly coming downstairs. I wasn't sure what to do so I fake coughed and was a bit louder than usual as I finished my trip down the stairs. It definitely startled them, but I'm fairly sure(at the time) they didn't realize I had heard them. We said our good mornings and chatted while I joined them for coffee. I tried my best to push it out of my mind, but just couldn't, so later that night I confronted them.  

After some stuttering and extreme awkwardness, they explained what happened.  Their parents started dating when they were about 14, but they had known each other before, being in same grade and going to the same school. Each admitted they had a small mutual crush but had never really spent much since time together as they were part of different social groups. However, after the wedding they started living together, and a few months later(a bit shy of 2 years after their parents met, when they were about 16) they say things ""just happened"". Apparently quite a few times over the last twoish years of high school up until they graduated and ended up at different colleges. After that, they'd only see each other at breaks and holidays, with both dating several other people in the interim between then and when my husband and I started dating. Both swear they haven't been intimate since and have no desire to again. 

We had talked about our ""firsts"" while dating, but he just said it was someone he ""went to high school with"" and that they were never really dating and basically FWBs that casually hooked-up now and then. He did use his sister's middle name- I guess he wasn't quick enough to come up with a better fake name-, but it's a very common name so didn't really seem strange..until now anyway... I'm the only one who knows their secret other than the two of them. I want to trust my husband, and from their conversation and general demeanor around each other I think their feelings now are purely familial, but I just couldn't process what I was hearing. I freaked out pretty bad on both of them, saying it was still perverse and they were both freaks. I quickly packed a bag with some spare clothes and left to stay in a hotel while I collect my thoughts. Honestly I should have kicked HIM and his sister out, but just had to get away from that situation asap. 

He's been texting me non stop saying I'm being dramatic, and it really shouldn't be a huge deal. He justifies it by saying it's ""not like our parents got married when we were little kids and we grew up together. We were young and horny and liked each other"". Or that ""what if there was an alternate universe where our(my husband and myself), parents met AFTER the two of us were dating and ended up getting married. We'd then technically be step-siblings then so would we then be ""perverts"" for having sex?"" I...understand the point he's TRYING to make, but just....ew..It did NOT make me feel better. 

I'm just at a loss. I don't know how I'm ever going to look at them the same now(especially HER). Please help me. AIO here?

EDIT: So I realized I bugled the title a bit. As I was writing this I was 100% planning on calling him back and telling them both to get the fuck out as I shouldn't be the one left, and thought it would be a more catchy succinct title. Then as I was writing I calmed down just enough to decide to get some opions first and didn't think to change it. ",31,1749683784.0,AmIOverreacting,93,0.82,False

The current owners are a big time roaster/shop owner that have been in business for 40 years, they are just moving their entire operation to a new state. Included in the sale is a fully functioning cafe with all equipment included. 1500 sq ft building (leased 4k per month, estimated high) in a prime location, 190k in all the equipment, furniture, POS, literally everything. The last 2 years gross revenue was 675k, they are selling everything for 75k and paying for the first 2 months rent to help the new owners get going.   
First question, has it been worth it? I know its going to take loads of work, more than I realize, I'm expected to be tied to the business for a long time, I'm ready for that.   
Second question, financially, does this seem worth it? From what I've researched (and read here) the financial barrier of entry is normally high, but this doesn't seem to have that issue.

We're about to embark on a quest, a glorious, budget-friendly expedition to uncover the secrets of snagging cheap international flights. Forget those eye-watering price tags that make your soul weep. We're talking about places where your dollars stretch like elastic, where you can sip foreign brews without feeling the pinch, and where your Instagram feed will pop without needing a second mortgage. So, buckle up, buttercups! Let's dive headfirst into the delightful world of the **cheapest places to fly internationally**.

The Siren Call of Savings: How to Spot Those Flight Deals
---------------------------------------------------------

You know that feeling when you see a plane soaring overhead? There's this undeniable pull, a whisper of adventure calling your name. But then you check flight prices, and that whisper turns into a bloodcurdling scream. Don't despair! Finding affordable international flights isn't about sorcery; it's about savvy, and a little bit of knowing where to look, that's all. Think of it like a treasure hunt, and we're your friendly, slightly eccentric treasure map makers.

### No More Sticker Shock: Understanding the Factors That Drive Flight Prices

Ever wondered why flying to one city costs less than a week's groceries, while flying to another requires selling a kidney? It's a complex cocktail of factors, a delicate dance between supply and demand, airline competition, and even the time of year. Airfares are notoriously volatile, like a moody teenager. Understanding what makes them tick is the first step towards bagging a bargain. Think about it: when everyone wants to go somewhere, prices go up, pure and simple. Airlines are businesses, after all, and they're looking to make a buck. It's not personal, just economics!

Here are some of the key players in this price game:

- **Demand:** The more people want to travel to a specific place, the higher the price. Simple as that. Flying to Paris in August? Expect to pay a premium.
- **Competition:** If multiple airlines fly the same route, they're more likely to lower prices to attract customers. More players in the game usually mean better deals for us consumers.
- **Fuel Costs:** Airlines use a lot of fuel (duh!), so fluctuations in oil prices directly impact ticket costs. When oil prices are high, so are airfares.
- **Operating Costs:** This includes everything from airport fees and crew salaries to maintenance. These costs get passed on to us, the passengers.
- **Time of Year:** Peak season (think summer holidays, Christmas, etc.) always means higher prices. Low season, conversely, offers significant savings. Timing is everything, y'know?
- **Booking Time:** This is a tricky one, but generally, booking too early or too late can cost you. There's a sweet spot, and finding it is an art form.

By grasping these underlying forces, you're better equipped to predict and, more importantly, *avoid* those painfully high prices. It's like having a secret decoder ring for airfare jargon!

Asia on a Shoestring: Exploring the Cheapest Places to Fly Internationally in the East
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asia is having a moment, and for good reason! It’s a vibrant tapestry of cultures, cuisines, and stunning landscapes, and guess what? It can also be incredibly affordable to visit, provided you know where the deals are. Forget pricey hotspots like Tokyo or Singapore if you're on a super tight budget. We're talking about places where your money whispers rather than screams, places where you can eat like royalty for a few bucks and explore ancient wonders without breaking the bank. These are some of the **cheapest places to fly internationally** for amazing Asian adventures.

### Southeast Asian Charms: Where Your Dollar Goes Further

Southeast Asia is the undisputed champion of budget-friendly travel. It’s a backpacker's paradise, a food lover's dream, and an adventurer's playground, all rolled into one incredibly affordable package. The infrastructure is generally pretty good, and getting around is cheap and easy. Plus, the people are incredibly friendly! Seriously, you feel so welcomed.

- **Thailand:** Ah, Thailand! The classic starting point for any Southeast Asian adventure. With bustling Bangkok, ancient temples in Chiang Mai, and stunning islands in the south, Thailand offers something for everyone. Flights to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) or Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) are often surprisingly cheap, especially from major hubs in the US and Europe. Once you're there, the cost of living is incredibly low. Think delicious street food for a couple of dollars, budget guesthouses for under $20 a night, and local transport that’s a fraction of the cost back home. Just be mindful of tourist traps – stick to where the locals eat!
- **Vietnam:** Vietnam is a sensory explosion in the best possible way. From the vibrant streets of Hanoi and the historical charm of Hoi An to the stunning landscapes of Ha Long Bay and the Mekong Delta, Vietnam is an unforgettable destination. Flights to Hanoi (HAN) or Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) are consistently affordable, and once you arrive, your money stretches like a dream. Vietnamese food is legendary and incredibly cheap, accommodation options are numerous and budget-friendly, and you can easily get around by train or bus for pennies. Don't miss the pho - it's life-changing!
- **Malaysia:** A melting pot of cultures, Malaysia offers a fascinating blend of Malay, Chinese, and Indian influences. Kuala Lumpur is a modern metropolis with iconic landmarks like the Petronas Twin Towers, while Penang offers fantastic food and historical charm. Flights to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL) are often competitive, and while slightly more expensive than Thailand or Vietnam in some aspects, it still offers excellent value for money. Plus, it's a great hub for exploring the rest of Southeast Asia.
- **Indonesia:** Home to over 17,000 islands, Indonesia is incredibly diverse. Bali might be the most famous, but there are countless other islands to explore, offering incredible beaches, volcanoes, and cultural experiences. Flights to Jakarta (CGK) or Denpasar (DPS) can be quite reasonable, particularly if you're flying from Australia or other parts of Asia. Inter-island travel can add up, but the cost of living on the islands themselves is generally very low. Just picture yourself on a remote beach, cocktail in hand, for less than you'd pay for a fancy coffee back home!

These destinations offer a fantastic entry point into the world of budget international travel. You can experience incredible cultures, eat amazing food, and see breathtaking sights without needing to take out a loan.

Stepping Across the Atlantic: European Bargains Await
-----------------------------------------------------

Europe! The land of ancient castles, charming villages, and art that will make your jaw drop. It sounds expensive, right? Well, it *can* be, but it doesn't have to be. While flying to major Western European hubs like London or Paris can cost a pretty penny, there are plenty of European gems that are surprisingly affordable to fly to and to explore once you're there. Finding the **cheapest places to fly internationally** in Europe is all about looking east and south.

### Eastern European Enchantment: Culture and Value in Every Corner

Eastern Europe has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent decades. These countries, once behind the Iron Curtain, now offer a fascinating blend of history, culture, and stunning architecture, all at a fraction of the price of their Western European counterparts. Plus, the crowds are generally smaller, which is a definite bonus.

- **Poland:** Rich in history and culture, Poland is a fantastic and affordable European destination. From the medieval charm of Krakow and the vibrant capital of Warsaw to the somber history of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Poland offers a powerful and moving experience. Flights to Krakow (KRK) or Warsaw (WAW) are often very affordable, especially with budget airlines. Once you're there, the cost of living is incredibly low. You can find delicious Polish food for very little and accommodation is plentiful and reasonably priced.
- **Hungary:** Budapest, the Pearl of the Danube, is a city that will steal your heart. With its stunning architecture, thermal baths, and ruin bars, it’s a truly unique destination. Flights to Budapest (BUD) are often competitive, and once you're there, prices for food, accommodation, and activities are refreshingly low. Exploring the city on foot is easy and free, and a soak in a thermal bath is an absolute must-do!

Cracking the Code: Finding Those Elusive Cheap Flights
------------------------------------------------------

Knowing the relatively **cheapest places to fly internationally** is half the battle. The other half is actually *finding* those rock-bottom fares. It's like playing a giant, global game of hide-and-seek, but with airplanes. Don't worry, we've got some top-notch strategies to help you sniff out those deals.

### The Art of the Search: Tools and Tricks for Finding Affordable Airfare

Forget endlessly refreshing airline websites like a maniac. There are much smarter ways to go about this. Leveraging technology and being flexible are your best friends in the quest for cheap flights.

- **Use Flight Comparison Websites:** These are your secret weapon! Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, and Hopper allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines and travel dates simultaneously. They're like having a personal flight shopper, just without the judgment about your questionable packing choices.
    
    
    - **Skyscanner:** This is a personal favorite. Its ""Everywhere"" search feature is revolutionary. You can enter your departure airport and then select ""Everywhere"" as your destination, and it will show you the cheapest places to fly *to* within your selected timeframe. Seriously, try it! It's a game-changer for discovering unexpected, affordable destinations.
    - **Google Flights:** Another fantastic tool. It offers powerful features like price tracking, flexible date searches, and a handy calendar view that shows you the cheapest days to fly. You can also explore destinations on a map, which is great for visual planners.
    - **Kayak:** A long-standing player in the flight search game, Kayak offers a comprehensive search platform and useful tools like price forecasts.
    - **Hopper:** This app uses historical data to predict whether flight prices will go up or down, giving you recommendations on whether to book now or wait. It's like having a tiny, incredibly clever crystal ball for flight prices.
- **Be Flexible with Your Travel Dates and Times:** This is HUGE! Flying in the middle of the week is almost always cheaper than flying on a Friday or Sunday. Similarly, flying at crack-of-dawn times or late at night can often save you a significant amount of money. A little inconvenience can equal big savings, you know?
- **Consider Flying into Alternative Airports:** Sometimes, flying into a slightly less popular airport near your desired destination can be significantly cheaper. Factor in the cost and time of getting from that airport to your final destination, but it's definitely worth looking into.
- **Book in Advance (But Not *Too* Far in Advance):** As mentioned earlier, there's a sweet spot. Booking too early means airlines haven't released their cheapest fares yet. Booking too late means demand has increased and prices have gone up. Generally, booking 1-3 months in advance for international travel is a good rule of thumb, but this can vary depending on the destination and time of year.
- **Sign Up for Flight Deal Alerts:** Many flight comparison websites and dedicated flight deal websites (like Scott's Cheap Flights or The Flight Deal) offer email alerts when great deals pop up. It's like having a notification for awesome travel opportunities delivered right to your inbox.
- **Clear Your Browsing Cookies (Sometimes):** While the effectiveness of this is debated, some argue that airlines and travel websites track your searches and can inflate prices if they see you're repeatedly looking at a particular route. Clearing your cookies might help reset the playing field. It can't hurt to try, right?

Using these tools and strategies effectively is like having a secret weapon in the fight against high airfares. You're not just blindly searching; you're strategically hunting for the best possible deals. And believe me, finding a killer flight deal feels like winning the lottery, almost!

### Budgeting Like a Boss: Tips for Affordable Travel on the Ground

Traveling cheaply isn't just about getting a cheap flight; it's about making conscious choices about where you stay, what you eat, and how you get around. It's about recognizing that ""budget"" doesn't mean ""boring""; it means ""smart.""

- **Embrace Public Transportation:** Buses, trains, and local metro systems are almost always significantly cheaper than taxis or ride-sharing services. It's also a fantastic way to see how the locals live!
- **Eat Like a Local:** Skip the fancy, overpriced tourist restaurants. Head to local markets, street food stalls, and small, family-run restaurants. The food is often more authentic, tastier, and a fraction of the price. Plus, it's a great way to truly experience the local culture through its cuisine.
- **Stay in Budget Accommodation:** Hostels, guesthouses, and even Airbnb rooms in local neighborhoods can save you a bundle compared to hotels. Hostels are also a great way to meet other travelers!
- **Take Advantage of Free Activities:** Many cities offer free walking tours, and exploring parks, museums (some have free entry days!), and local neighborhoods on foot is completely free and incredibly rewarding.
- **Look for Local Deals and Discounts:** Many destinations offer tourist cards that provide discounts on attractions and public transport. Do a little research before you go.
- **Travel During the Off-Season or Shoulder Season:** Not only are flights cheaper, but accommodation and activity prices are often lower as well, and the crowds are smaller! It's a win-win situation.
- **Pack Light to Avoid Checked Baggage Fees:** Those checked baggage fees can seriously add up! Try to travel with just a carry-on if possible. It takes practice, but it's worth it.
- **Learn a Few Basic Phrases of the Local Language:** While English is widely spoken in tourist areas, making an effort to speak a few words of the local language is always appreciated and can sometimes even lead to better prices or more friendly interactions.

Traveling on a budget is totally do-able, and it doesn't mean sacrificing the quality of your experience. It just means being mindful and making smart choices along the way.
