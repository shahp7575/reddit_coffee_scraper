1qx3oib,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qx3oib/i_pulled_a_gray_hair_this_morning_but_it_kept/,"I pulled a gray hair this morning, but it kept coming out.","I saw it in the bathroom mirror while I was brushing my teeth.

The lighting in my apartment is unforgiving. It is those harsh vanity bulbs that expose every pore and every flaw. I usually try to ignore them. I try to wash my face and get out. But this morning the light caught something silver near my left temple.

It was just a single strand.

I leaned in. I rested my palms on the cold porcelain of the sink. It was definitely gray. Maybe even white. I am twenty-six. I shouldn't be graying yet. My mother didn't gray until she was fifty. I told myself it was stress. I told myself it was the lack of sleep and the overtime and the way the city grinds you down until you lose your color.

I opened the cabinet. I found the tweezers.

They were cold in my hand. I have done this a dozen times for stray eyebrow hairs. You isolate the strand. You grip it near the base. You pull. It is supposed to be a sharp pinch. A little water in the eyes. Then it is over.

I gripped the gray hair. I pulled.

There was resistance.

It didn't slide out. It held fast. It felt anchored to something deep inside my scalp. It wasn't the sharp sting of a hair follicle. It was a heavy, dull pressure. It felt like I was trying to pull a loose thread out of a heavy sweater.

I frowned. I readjusted my grip. I wrapped the tweezers around the strand again and tugged harder.

The skin on my forehead tented. It stretched out an inch. Two inches. The gray strand didn't break. It just kept coming.

It made a sound.

It was a wet, sucking noise. Like a boot pulling out of deep mud.

I should have stopped. A normal person would have stopped. But I was panicked. I was disgusted. I just wanted it out of me. I dropped the tweezers. I wrapped the long, gray strand around my index finger. I braced my other hand against the mirror.

I heaved.

It gave way.

I stumbled back against the towel rack. I looked at my hand.

Six inches of gray material were coiled around my finger. It wasn't hair. It was too thick. It was fibrous and rough. It was covered in a clear, sticky sap that smelled like rain and wet dirt. I unwound it and dropped it into the sink.

It moved.

It wasn't just curling from the tension. It was writhing. It sought out the water droplets near the drain. The end of it... the part that had been inside my head, was split into tiny, white filaments. They were grasping at the porcelain.

They were drinking.

Roots.

I felt the hole in my temple. I touched it with a shaking hand. It didn't bleed. It felt cold. The hole was perfectly round and dry.

I leaned back into the mirror. I needed to see. I needed to know how deep it went.

I saw something moving inside the pore.

There was green behind the skin. Not the pale green of a bruise or a vein. It was the vibrant, toxic green of new growth. It pushed against the dermis from the inside.

I grabbed a sewing needle from the kit under the sink. I sterilized it with a lighter until the tip glowed orange. I had to know.

I picked at the hole. I widened it. I dug until the needle hit something solid.

It made a thock sound.

It wasn't bone.

It was wood.

I pressed harder. The needle sank into it. It was soft, wet bark. My skull isn't bone anymore. It is soft. I can press my thumb into the center of my forehead and it leaves an indentation. It stays there for minutes.

I sat on the toilet lid. I waited for the panic to come back. I waited for the urge to call a doctor or scream or run to the emergency room. But the panic didn't come.

Instead, a strange calm washed over me. The pressure in my head, the headache I have had for weeks, was gone. The tension in my neck was gone.

I can hear them growing now. It sounds like paper crumpling inside my ears. A soft, rhythmic rustling. They are filling the sinus cavities first. I can feel the pressure building behind my eyes, but it doesn't hurt. It feels secure. It feels like being held.

The smell of soil is stronger now. It is in the back of my throat. It tastes like copper and minerals. I am not calling a doctor. I know what they will do. They will try to cut it out. They will try to poison it with medicine. They will try to kill the garden.

I walked to the window a moment ago. I opened the blinds. The sun hit my face and I felt a rush of energy that I have never felt before. It was better than coffee. It was better than sleep.

I am so thirsty. I have never been this thirsty in my life.

I think I am going to fill the bathtub. I think I am going to lie in the water and let the sun hit my face.

I think I am going to let it bloom.",1,1770340355.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

If Seattle's Best Coffee or isang small cafe. Maganda ang SBC sa resume pero hindi naging maganda yung experience ko sa interview so here's the story,

Ang weird kasi bigla akong in-email ng agency/coop for ‘final interview’ agad, kaya pumunta ako kahit feeling ko medyo scam. Pagdating ko sa store, dead stare lang yung staff walang greeting at all. Pinaghintay ako mga 30 minutes bago mainterview inintindi ko kasi baka busy. Yung interview medyo off kasi tinanong ng manager bakit di nalang ako nag-stay sa previous job kahit resolved na yung issue (nakasmirk pa sya). Tinignan pa katawan ko at sinabing baka di ko kayanin magbuhat kasi payat ako. Tinanong kung anong weakness ko at sinabi ko na pagiging mahiyain pero kind of inoovercome ko during customer interaction tapos sabi niya hindi daw pwede yun kasi kailangan makipag-connect sa customers—eh ironic kasi hindi naman welcoming yung staff nila haha. Tinanong pa kung umiyak na daw ba ako sa trabaho kaya ang dating sakin ay mukhang malakas sila mang powertrip, kaya naging red flag talaga yung vibe. By the way, hindi pala niya alam na ‘final interview’ na ko haha.

At itong small cafe, dito nagwowork yung kapatid ko at hinihintay lang ako mag go sa kanila. Peaceful and mukhang masaya yung environment dun ayun nga lang parang downgrade sa resume.

Parehas pala silang minimum wage parehas may free coffee. Pinagkaiba nga lang may insurance and allowance dito sa small cafe. Kaso yung resume ko talaga iniisip ko hahaha.

But sadly I don't normally buy fruits and veggies like that, and the ones I do buy a lot of, apparently are problematic in some way (lemons, onions, cabbage etc)

So my question is what should I be feeding them besides cardboard and coffee grounds? (Which I have essentially unlimited amounts of.) I'm happy to buy them food but I'd like to do it efficiently and economically 

I also have alfalfa meal, kelp meal, all kinds of organic fertilizers. Can any of those be added?

BASICALLY: Me and a girl reconnected for the second time. The first time she missed me still after 8 months even though she broke up with me but was afraid to reach out because she thought i hated her. Whole time i felt something and felt we were meant to be so i reached out and she told me how her year wasn’t so great that the day we had was fun and she was happy and we want to have more days like that, and so we started talking for like 2 months and she was asking me out and i rejected her because i didn’t feel ready she ended up tryna make me jealous ina truly harmless way but i took it as a chance to get healthy and seperate from her while planning to come back later but then didn’t and a month turned into a year and some change. I finally reconnected again but during the time apart i noticed some guy that fetishizes her race of women online was following her and i knew him from high school i wanted to know why he was following her or knew her and i didn’t want him to run his mouth to her so i tried my best to act like i didn’t know her or care about her so he would get suspicious that i liked her and feel intimidated and ask her how she knows me when i wasn’t ready yet to go talk to her and it was just embarrassing and insecure. Basically upon reconnecting i didn’t sleep all night my ac was out and i tossed and turn hot all night i was exhausted she texted me i spoke to her and she initially asked how i was but when i asked what was new she said a lot but didn’t want to get into it. “we are not really friends anymore and i know what you said to jack behind my back, i thought it was unkind i never did anything bad to you” It been 7 months since i spoke to jack so all i knew is i had a weak moment trying to make sure this guy only knew her in some ordinary way and that i didn’t speak with any malice in my heart  so i was confused to what she heard so i asked her so we can clear it up and she said “it’s nothing to clear up i saw the messages i just thought that it was unkind” Then i looked her name up told her the example i saw and she said ”it’s so much more than that it’s whatever i’m over it i said i’m doing well hope you’re too that’s it” so she stormed off basically because my message made her feel i read the whole chat between me and this dude and only saw that what’s wrong but the truth was that was the only time i said her name and the only part i reread. The rest of the chat i described her impersonally as a black girl with a fro. Or acted like i didn’t know her and i’m sure wether she knew why i did it or not which i’m sure part of her felt like it was insecure stuff because i missed her but i’m sure part of her fears that i just didn’t care about her and that’s how i felt was affirmed by my response because my message sounded like i saw the whole chat and saw nothing wrong with it. So she felt the depth she felt for me i never felt and faked and it was all a sham and she’d wasted time longing for thinking about me after all this time and there was no where for her frustration to go since to her i didn’t even see her or what i did wrong. I apologized and got no answer. I know she deserves a thoughtful apology and didn’t want her thinking i never cared about her and all this so i crafted a good apology expressing remorse explaining it was wrong that while i didn’t want to apologize and it be an admission of guilt that she was hurt and that was reason enough to apologize and i could have still explained my reasoning that i was embarrassed by the foolish thing i did and why i did it and it looks bad and even tho it was so he would t go running his mouth it totally was still wrong to ever misrepresent my feelings for her out of my mouth in any way to anyone because for what reason was i doing it? it wasn’t for his sake but for hers so she wouldn’t see me talk nice and he thinks i like her goes telling her and then she wants me to come back and i don’t cuz im not ready. But it was stupid as fuck i know. She had me blocked i didn’t know so i texted her on text now she unblocked me and she said Thank you. then i was scared and pushed her away cuz i thought she was gonna reject me but didn’t know i was doing it and avoided and made it seem like it was about giving her space to process things and she was like “wym process everything” she wanted to talk more i’d opened her heart and reversed the loss of hope and grief she felt that week after the reconnection. But then pushed her away. Next day all i sent was thought about you today god be with you. totally not inviting conversation and the next day i didn’t even text her. The first day after the apology she smiled for the first time since the grief on her story. Then that night posted pics from when we dated last year and put kash paige love songs playing “we can make it last forever yore the only one i want” and “i just want to be loved and loved forever” as a caption the next night over the same pics she scrolled up and chose purposely from that time because it was about me. But i was avoiding her. I finally reach out and she now pushing me away as a defense mechanism scared i was abandoning her so she doing it first she told me “i’m not really interested in reconnecting” it had ambivalence because she was scared and pulling away but she still wanted it. I spilled my guts saying the most overwhelming shit confessing my love i mean stuff a secure person would be like this is a lot. She pushed back but i said i wanted to love her forever which was pressure to an avoidant. But the next day i reached out when i hadn’t slept. We talked she opened up told me bout ptsd from he friend tryna get her jumped and just why she more had walls up and about her life and we laughed and joked then a shooting happened outside the nail salon she got locked in was scared leaned on me texted the whole time i was her rock but then she started withdrawing. For the rest of that week i was apologizing pressuring emotionally by saying sorry for sleeping through my alarms after the shooting i was gonna check on you i didn’t sleep from the night we had that intense convo yet. She asked me talk later i didn’t reach out she felt abandoned again i apologized for that said i thought since you didn’t reach out you wanted space and needed it because i was sensitive and assuming i was doing wrong because the shootint happened. Bacislly this all ended in her getting defensive again she gave me a read receipt when i texted her in the e morning by the end of the week and to me it totally meant she just needed space n didn’t want to communicate it i reached out still later thinking i’m scared she may feel abandoned i’m afraid i’ll overwhelm her by reaching out though and like it was just unhealthy she told me “i’m not very interested anymore i just don’t feel how i used to “ again i recognized just and very to be softener she wanted me didn’t wanna outright reject me but didn’t feel safe continuing. I shut down and texted another short paragraph then sent a neutral “it’s cold out huh bundle up message” later and she read that after ten days and i messaged her five days after then she said im not interested anymore. I know she loves i know i was being pressuring or not showing effort or internet so she was scared of engulfment and abandonment and i triggers her to deactivate on top of the shooting and the other stuff that happened. I really would like advice she looks really sad in her recent photo when she looked relieved at first i believe she misses me and regrets it. I want to flirt with her and show up calm and confident and not walk on eggshells around her avoidance and let her push me away because she’s scared and i believe if i come back and make her feel safe with calm self assured internet that isn’t intense nor is it flat and cold she won’t even triggered her system won’t flare up and she won’t push me away and her love will lead her to respond. And we can work this out. I don’t want to lose her over somethin i see now is so clearly fixable and worth fixing to both of us. I was thinking about texting her trying to be cute and flirty but ask how she’s doing and possibly securely state that i’m interested and i’d like to take her for coffee i know it’s not certainly going to work and i’m scared it i’m not letting that stop me anymore. I’m afraid in this time she also got asked to be someone else’s valentine in 70 days we been apart and would harshly shut me down but i don’t want to regret not reaching out if that’s not the case too. Any advice is welcome but my mind is pretty set on reaching out ina playful lighthearted way showing interest and complimenting her instead of being heavy over explaining or down right cold and emotions less because i’m checked out and scared of being abandoned. i think she’ll respond well please let me know a opening line i have ideas but i’m open. i’m certain she shut down under overwhelm and not lack of interest or love i’ve done work to get better and i learned skills to navigate and have a new approach i believe will work just as it did before ",1,1770340252.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Being in a fast-paced environment (startup + grad school), the FOMO is real. I felt like I needed to know everything about AI agents, GTM strategies, and market shifts, but I had exactly zero blocks of ""2 hours"" to sit and study.

We’ve all been there: You find a great non-fiction book or a deep-dive article, you ""save"" it for later, and you never look at it again. Or worse, you read a 10-minute summary, feel smart for five minutes, and then forget everything by dinner.

The problem isn't your memory; it’s that passive consumption doesn't scale. Working in the AI space and being a grad student, I had to find a way to learn that actually ""sticks"" during my 15-minute commute. I’ve spent the last few months refining a microlearning habit that relies on AI-driven active recall rather than just reading.



The ""Cognitive Mirror"" System:

Stop Summarizing, Start Debating: I’ve moved away from standard audiobooks. Instead, I use a tool called Aibrary that has this feature called Idea Twin. It basically takes the core concepts of a book and lets you ""host a podcast"" with an AI version of the author or an expert. It challenges your thinking in real-time. If I don't understand a concept, I have to defend my stance against the AI. It forces the brain into an ""active"" state.

The ""For You"" Feed over Social Media: I replaced my morning ""doom-scroll"" with a personalized audio feed. Instead of random news, it delivers a 10-minute ""Daily Bite"" based on my specific career goals (GTM, AI ethics, etc.). By the time I finish my coffee, I’ve actually engaged with a new concept.



TL;DR: If you want to build a learning habit that lasts, stop trying to ""consume"" more content. Start using AI agents to challenge your assumptions.",1,1770340216.0,Habits,1,1.0,False

1qx3icp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hokkaido/comments/1qx3icp/rv_ski_trip_in_hokkaido_our_experience_so_far/,RV Ski trip in Hokkaido- our experience (so far!),"We rented an RV to chase the snow and are currently on Hokkaido enjoying a down day due to high winds closing the lifts. I will update at the end of the trip, but thought I would share some of our experience in case it’s helpful to others. 

Campervan - we rented from Japan CRC. Rv is a TOYOTA Hiace Robinson 771. It is said to sleep 4 adults + 3 children, but with ski gear it’s comfortable for 2 adults. 4 adults would be really tight! Cost was 466,200 JPY for 14 nights. We figured that this was approx the same cost as a rental car + hotel and we had the flexibility of moving around the island. 

We were concerned about being cold, but so far the heater has kept us toasty warm. There’s a good sized beer fridge, we stock up on supplies from convenience stores and sleep in the top bunk over the cab. We rented the following as add ons: blankets, pillows, sleeping bags and the cooking set. I’d recommend all of these! There’s a little camp stove that we use to boil water for coffee and noodles. We brought one down sleeping bag from home and should have brought two. The rental blankets aren’t quite enough. So my husband wears his down jacket to bed if he’s cold lol. If you do rent the rv, pack a towels (we brought microfibre camping towels) and some type of thin towel for the floor by the door to keep the snow from going everywhere when you come in with your boots. 

Considerations - finding a place to park at night. We have stayed at rest stops so far (minus the first night at a Shoe Plaza parking lot in Sapporo). The rest stops are great!! Bathrooms open 24/7. 

Onsens - using the onsens to bathe each day is brilliant! Make sure to have cash. The quiet atmosphere and soaking in hot pools is magic. 

Trash - this is a tricky one! There really aren’t a lot of places to throw out your trash. We have started putting small amounts of garbage in small bags (empty chip bags or ziplocks) and throwing it out when we purchase something from a convenience store. Same with recycling bottles. At first I was convinced we would be bringing home our garbage in our suitcases to throw out in Canada. 😛

I really wasn’t prepared for down days due to lifts being closed (although this shouldn’t have surprised me). I’m glad I packed my kindle and cribbage. It’s one of fun to be snowed in and have a day to relax. 

So far we rip, rinse, ramen, repeat. 

Kiroro - so good !!! 

Rusutsu - more expensive and feels more touristy, but great skiing in bounds if you’re solo. 

Guides - we hired a local Japanese guide through explore-share. Not the same experience as going through a guide company. But less expensive ! ",1,1770339910.0,Hokkaido,0,1.0,False

The lighting in my apartment is unforgiving. It is those harsh vanity bulbs that expose every pore and every flaw. I usually try to ignore them. I try to wash my face and get out. But this morning the light caught something silver near my left temple.

It was just a single strand.

I leaned in. I rested my palms on the cold porcelain of the sink. It was definitely gray. Maybe even white. I am twenty-six. I shouldn't be graying yet. My mother didn't gray until she was fifty. I told myself it was stress. I told myself it was the lack of sleep and the overtime and the way the city grinds you down until you lose your color.

I opened the cabinet. I found the tweezers.

They were cold in my hand. I have done this a dozen times for stray eyebrow hairs. You isolate the strand. You grip it near the base. You pull. It is supposed to be a sharp pinch. A little water in the eyes. Then it is over.

I gripped the gray hair. I pulled.

There was resistance.

It didn't slide out. It held fast. It felt anchored to something deep inside my scalp. It wasn't the sharp sting of a hair follicle. It was a heavy, dull pressure. It felt like I was trying to pull a loose thread out of a heavy sweater.

I frowned. I readjusted my grip. I wrapped the tweezers around the strand again and tugged harder.

The skin on my forehead tented. It stretched out an inch. Two inches. The gray strand didn't break. It just kept coming.

It made a sound.

It was a wet, sucking noise. Like a boot pulling out of deep mud.

I should have stopped. A normal person would have stopped. But I was panicked. I was disgusted. I just wanted it out of me. I dropped the tweezers. I wrapped the long, gray strand around my index finger. I braced my other hand against the mirror.

I heaved.

It gave way.

I stumbled back against the towel rack. I looked at my hand.

Six inches of gray material were coiled around my finger. It wasn't hair. It was too thick. It was fibrous and rough. It was covered in a clear, sticky sap that smelled like rain and wet dirt. I unwound it and dropped it into the sink.

It moved.

It wasn't just curling from the tension. It was writhing. It sought out the water droplets near the drain. The end of it... the part that had been inside my head, was split into tiny, white filaments. They were grasping at the porcelain.

They were drinking.

Roots.

I felt the hole in my temple. I touched it with a shaking hand. It didn't bleed. It felt cold. The hole was perfectly round and dry.

I leaned back into the mirror. I needed to see. I needed to know how deep it went.

I saw something moving inside the pore.

There was green behind the skin. Not the pale green of a bruise or a vein. It was the vibrant, toxic green of new growth. It pushed against the dermis from the inside.

I grabbed a sewing needle from the kit under the sink. I sterilized it with a lighter until the tip glowed orange. I had to know.

I picked at the hole. I widened it. I dug until the needle hit something solid.

It made a thock sound.

It wasn't bone.

It was wood.

I pressed harder. The needle sank into it. It was soft, wet bark. My skull isn't bone anymore. It is soft. I can press my thumb into the center of my forehead and it leaves an indentation. It stays there for minutes.

I sat on the toilet lid. I waited for the panic to come back. I waited for the urge to call a doctor or scream or run to the emergency room. But the panic didn't come.

We spent months building something for a vision we have in fintech.

As someone who works with spreadsheets all day, tacking my personal budget felt like a second job. Parang part-time work pa.

So we created **Alkansya AI** \- expense tracking that feels like texting a friend.

""Grab 250"" ""Jollibee 300"" - tap, type, done. Everything else is automatic.

This is our first app ever. We literally didn't know how to build an app from scratch or even list on the App Store when we started.

Right now: **100 daily active users**. Some on free trial, some already paying, this our 4th week na live na yung app namin sa IOS. (Android this March)

At first we considered freemium, but I didn't want to rely on ads. Our app doesn't have tiered features anyway - it's straightforward. The whole offer is removing the ""nakakatamad"" friction.

You know that thing where you spend outside, log it in your notes or text yourself, then go home and open spreadsheets later?

Now it's just: tap, chat, done. Everything's there.

I believe in this vision enough that we went straight to paid with a 30-day free trial. Let people truly assess the value.

**Why I'm building this:**

This is a passion product. I have a vision. This is part of my purpose. I love what I'm doing.

We're bootstrapping and that's okay. The goal is to provide real value and keep improving for our users.

100 DAU as first-timers, we are just really happy with this.

Also, we need users and feedback.

If budgeting has been a struggle for you (spreadsheets, forgetting to log, apps you quit after 3 days), maybe Alkansya AI can help. 30-day trial on iOS.

Tell us what sucks. What's missing. What would actually make you use it.

Need feedback from actual users.

1qx3fb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qx3fb7/after_6_years_of_espresso_im_throwing_in_the/,"After 6 years of espresso, I’m throwing in the towel. The toddlers won... for now.","I’ve been an espresso enthusiast for six years. I love the hobby, the gear, and the ""God Shot"" chase. But life has changed. I now have a three-year-old and an 8-month-old, and my ""morning ritual"" has turned into a high-stress logistical nightmare.

I’ve realized I just don’t have the time or the brainpower to be mucking about with WDT tools, puck screens, and dialing in shots at 6:00 AM while a toddler is climbing my leg and an infant is screaming for a bottle.

I’m seriously considering selling the entire setup and investing in a high-end drip machine (Moccamaster, Breville Precision, Fellow Aiden, etc).

The plan is to reclaim my mornings with a timer function. I’m dreaming of waking up to a finished carafe rather than a 15-minute workflow of grinding, tamping, and steaming—which usually ends with my coffee getting cold anyway because I’m busy being a dad.

This isn't a permanent retirement. The goal is to go back to espresso one day when the kids are older, the house is less hectic, and I actually have 20 minutes of peace to enjoy the process again. But for the next few years, I need Easy Mode.

To those who have made the ""Great Retreat"" from espresso back to filter:

The Time Savings: For those with kids, how much ""morning sanity"" did you actually claw back? Does having the machine do the work for you actually change the vibe of your morning?

The Satisfaction: Do you actually miss the shots, or does a properly brewed carafe of specialty beans satisfy the itch?

The Gear: If you switched specifically for ""Dad Mode"" reasons, which machine with a timer actually lived up to the hype?

I feel like I’m betraying the hobby, but I think I’m ready to prioritize sleep and sanity. Am I a genius, or am I going to regret this the second the gear leaves my house?",3,1770339684.0,espresso,4,0.71,False

1qx3b1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qx3b1h/lets_talk_about_high_extraction/,Let's talk about high extraction,"If you've spent almost any time on this or adjacent subreddits you will likely have heard some essential statements about extraction: that the perfect extraction is between 18 and 22%, if you go over that the coffee will be bitter, if you go under it'll be sour, therefore if your coffee is too sour you need to grind finer, if it's too bitter, grind coarser.

These rules seem intuitive and easy to understand, and I followed them for a long time, but rules are made to be broken, and over time I've come to rethink my view on extraction, and being careful, I've been able to extract much higher than the 18-22% boundary and made great cups of coffee with it, and I think in the idea lies the potential for even better cups.

Here's the basics:  
Coffee is a simple solution, dissolving a solute into a solvent to create a flavoured liquid, and the theoretical limit coffee can dissolve to is around 31%,scientifically ""perfect"" extraction would be bringing the coffee all the way to that 31% limit. The problem with that from an experience perspective is that by the time you're extracting at that rate, negative and astringent flavours are likely to come through, we don't yet have the roasting or brewing tech to make the most of that full 31% range, I believe this is why we developed the rules we did in the formative years of third wave. At that time, going over 22% extraction was likely dangerous and often resulted in unpleasant flavours.

But in the past 20 years coffee production and roasting has progressed, as has our understanding of how to brew. There are many roasters who focus on solubility and who can now develop light roasts in more advaced ways, and I think there are many coffees which, with the right technique, can be pushed above the 22% extraction mark, and taste better as a result while saving you money.

I know a cafe owner who owns a refractometer, they let me test this, and with certain DAK coffees, I was able to hit around 26-27% extraction while still tasting great, and I think that could go even higher if I play around with my technique. The key really is evenness of extraction, you can use a fine grind, and a lot of agitation, often resulting in a long TBT, as long as you're extracting the compounds of the coffee evenly by reducing channelling and clogging, I use a few methods for this:

\- Flat-bottomed brewers have a shallower bed that doesn't pack the coffee into a point, increasing evenness and reducing clogging

\- A large bloom makes sure everything gets saturated 100% before you start your pours, this really reduces channelling

\- A lot of swirling is the best way to flatten the bed and to keep water hitting the grounds after each pour, making sure that everything is extracted equally.

\- Using central pours instead of circles helps with fine migration when swirling and using such a fine grind, to pushes fines to the top of the bed where they can't clog the filter

Here's an example of a recipe I've been running with DAK electric lime:

Origami with Kalita wave 185 papers prewetted, water as hot as you can get it

14g in, approaching espresso-fine grind (but not quite)

bloom up to 70g and give it a quick swirl and tap to level, allow it to run dry (usually about 45 seconds - a minute), pour up to 160g, rinsing the fines off the filter then just pouring right down the middle, swirl and tap and wait for it to run dry again before pouring up to 250, right down the middle again, swirl and tap and let it drain to hopefully a pretty flat bed. Final brew time should be somewhere from 4-6 minutes.

This is a 1:18 recipe and it still has a lot of weight to it because of just how high it extracts, but the flavour is all there, arguably even more vividly and with even more sweetness because you're pulling compounds out of the coffee that just weren't there before. And I could easily reduce the dose to 13, 12, or even less grams if I wanted something more delicate or tea-like. This is where the economic argument really shines, because utilising high extraction you can use so much less coffee for the same TDS, which applies for cafes wanting to charge less or make better margins, and for home brewers wanting to get more mileage out of their bag of coffee.

From the european roasters I've tried, dak and tanat/ P}}P are the most consistent, but I think it can work with most well-rated coffees with some trial and error, but dak and tanat feel like they were designed for extractions like this. I personally wouldn't try this for any coffees rated under about 85, they just seem far too volatile and inconsistent.

Sorry for the very long post, I tried to keep it concise but this journey of thinking and testing has brought me to some very interesting places, it feels like this is something some people are aware of but is very rarely mentioned, so I took it upon myself to mention it. I'd love to hear if people have tried things similar, what anyone thinks about it as an idea amd anything else. Thanks for reading!",3,1770339370.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

Work is usually pretty slow unless something breaks or needs to be installed. Otherwise, im in my office most of the day on my phone. I'm down to share photos, too, if curious what I look like.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. I love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

1qx39ka,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qx39ka,Accidentally stayed at the Patriots Super Bowl property in Santa Clara,"I originally posted this in the r/marriott sub but shoutout to u/mnsks1234 who told me as a Patriots fan, you guys might enjoy this post too. 

I just finished a one night stay at the Santa Clara Marriott and it was a pretty cool experience. I booked this property because it was one of the only rooms available in the area for the night I needed. A few days before I arrived I received an email explaining that due to the proximity to Levi’s Stadium and the Super Bowl there would be a heavy law enforcement and security presence. They also made it very clear that late check out would not be offered to anyone regardless of elite status.

When I showed up I was surprised to find that the New England Patriots were actually staying at the property. The security operation was incredible to see in person. There were officers everywhere inside and outside including K9 units and patrols on ATVs circling the perimeter. They had installed wedge barriers so no vehicles could get near the front of the hotel. The entire interior was decorated for the team and the Super Bowl. Every elevator and TV screen along with the artwork and posters throughout the building was themed for the Patriots.

The only real downside was the M Lounge being closed in the morning for a private event. They did not have an alternate setup for breakfast or beverages which was a bit annoying. They told me I could purchase bottled water at a makeshift coffee bar they had set up but they were charging 3 dollars for the same VASA pure water that is usually free in the lounge. It felt like a bit of a joke to pay for the water they usually give away. At check in they again reiterated that there would be no late checkouts for any circumstance.

Overall it was a fun surprise to see the operation and watch the team buses come and go. I saw several staff members and even a couple players walking around in their official NFL badges and lanyards. It was a fun experience seeing it all and it made for a memorable stay even with the lack of typical elite perks.",46,1770339258.0,Patriots,1,1.0,False

We have a 3 year old and live in a state where you must be separated for a year prior to divorce.

We've been having problems for quite a while and I feel like I have hit my limit and have lost respect for my husband. I wonder if he is a pathological liar and/or just an addict.

Basically my husband started lying to me about vaping and marijuana use several years ago (he would lie about other insignificant things as well which has always been a concern - he wants to appear perfect it seems), and his use seemed to increase after we had our son (he was a tough baby which did not help our marriage) - I wondered if he had male postpartum depression and I likely had postpartum anxiety after a traumatic birth. His marijuana use, vaping, and social drinking increased after we had our son, and there were multiple safety incidents that occurred where my son could have been hurt or worse. He also became angry when high (he only used marijuana) and pushed me on several occasions which I am embarrassed to admit. Ultimately, he went to rehab while we lived apart for several months and has been sober (from marijuana) for around 9-10months with one relapse (drug testing). He has been going to Marijuanas Anonymous (or so I think) and he has been controlling his anger with no issues. Approximately 4-5 months ago he stopped drinking (or so I thought) after we were renting a house with friends and he did some embarrassing things and got black out drunk and actually peed in the corner of the room we were sharing with our child while he slept. The choice to stop drinking was made on his own, although I agreed with the decision. 

Most recently I found what appeared to be loose Zyns in his backpack (toddler could have found) which he did not tell me he was using and told me they were caffeine Zyns. Last week he left his phone at home unlocked and I looked through it, finding that on several nights he said he was going to the gym he didn't (we track each other's location). I also saw that he had been looking at porn multiple nights in a row... which I think is fine to a degree if you also have a healthy sex life with your partner which we don't as a result of everything that has happened.

Then yesterday I came home at lunchtime from work and his car was gone (he works from home), checking Find My Friends and seeing he was around the corner with our dog. I drove over there expecting to see him walking or playing with our dog but instead he was sitting in a parking lot of a preschool that was actively being dismissed drinking a tall boy IPA - in the middle of his work day and on a day where we had not yet discussed who would be picking our son up from school. Now I suspect he was drinking in the parking lot on the nights he said he was going to the gym and even at Marijuanas Anonymous meetings and who knows where else. 

Oh and he left our son eating his breakfast in his car seat on the way to school last week while he ran into a gas station to buy $3.50 ""coffee"" - which just happens to be the price of Zyns... I have never seen him purchase coffee at a gas station.

I don't want to live like this, always questioning and mothering and policing and worrying. It's incredibly disappointing because I felt like we had a chance until recently. 

My husband is a good person, with a good job, patient with our son, helps around the house, and of course has other endearing qualities - but he's an addict chasing dopamine hits it seems and he knows it's the lying that is destroying our relationship. I have told him I would be there for him if he relapses. We’ve also done some therapy and he says he’s seeing a therapist.

Somewhere along the way, the everyday life-logistics skills we all use — organizing, planning, remembering everyone’s favorite snacks — became an actual career path.

A career that:  
• works during school hours  
• doesn’t destroy your body or weekends  
• lets you still be present for your family  
• and somehow feels calmer than the jobs we were told were “stable”

I used to think the only way to earn good money was long hours, late nights, or total burnout. Turns out there’s a whole world of families who *need* someone to help run their lives smoothly — and they’re very happy to pay for it.

Friendly reminder: “mom skills” are not small skills. They’re high-demand life skills 💛",1,1770338791.0,LuxuryAssistants,0,1.0,False

I ended the convo by saying let me know if you end up like X and I'll let you know how Y was.

I will not be acting on it, they are happily married and I love their relationship, and I will hide my attraction til I die because it feels embarrassing and so dumb lmaooo

Anywaysssss

My brother (we’ll call him George) married a beautiful girl and at the time the two of us got along so well (we still do) and would refer to one another as “sister” before they even got married.

We did so much together, coffee trips or shopping or sleepovers. We were instant best friends and along with my brother we got on so well and do so much fun stuff together. George would pay for us to go on “girl trips” or take us both out because he wanted to show an example of what a good guy should do for me (my luck with men is so awful).

Now, I can barely handle being around them and its 100% a me problem and totally a minor problem but its still making me cringe at myself 💀💀💀

Recently, my brother’s partner came out as trans and started his transition. We’ll call him James.

James is such a *HOT* guy. Like could probably be a model or something. 

Ive know him through the beginning of him exploring his gender and he was gorgeous when he presented feminine. But I’m bi and never really felt “attracted” to him then. I have a type and he just wasn’t it but I recognised his beauty ya know

But now that he’s started testosterone, dresses more masculine, started working out and gaining muscle, I find him so attractive its INSANE. 💀 He’s no different personality wise, we do the same stuff together one on and one and as a group but I can’t help but feel like….😋😋😋😋 when we hang out. Like in a “omg James is so cuteeee” way. Like, he is truly the blueprint and I wish my dating life was filled with more people like him 😭😭😭

My brother really got lucky, James is so fucking *FINEEEEE* 😭 

I call it a crush but its really not that serious but I also feel so weird going from “we are like sisters” to “wait youre hot and if it wasn’t weird Id probably kiss you” likeeeeee……I can’t show my face around him right now cause all I do is get flustered now by his deeper voice and how he looks now. Am I crazy??? 

James also offered to take me on a “sibling date” on the 13th for Valentine’s day because I was just dumped not too long ago by a really shitty guy and he wants me to still enjoy the holiday and said I deserve it which is so fucking sweet but also please help hes HOT and MY BROTHER IN LAW and calling it a date feels WILDDDD when I actively think hes fine shit😭😭😭😭

Anyways Im literally gonna bury this til I die but I truly am so happy for him cause him and my brother are so in love and the happiest theyve ever been and I strive for such a wonderful, accepting, loving relationship. 🥹 But also I am so embarrassed by this new feeling and attraction of sorts and I want to die 🤓",1,1770338655.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

* Ending service at 9 p.m. every day
* Closing up to 15 stations 
* Shutting the Blue Line (Dublin/Pleasanton) and reducing other lines to only peak hour service or shortening routes
* Cutting train service hours by 70%
* Cutting 25% of the miles off the system

This level of service cuts would be terrible for traffic and for affordability for working people. And it would set back the Bay Area's economic recovery. 

Connect Bay Area is the 0.5% sales tax (in Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, and Santa Clara Counties, and 1% percent in San Francisco) that was negotiated in the state legislature for two years and that we're working to get on the November ballot via signatures. For about the cost of a monthly cup of coffee, we can fund transit services throughout our region and prevent this devastating level of cuts to BART. 

If a signature gatherer approaches you, please sign! Encourage your friends to sign, and to vote for it in November. And if you really want to go the extra mile with us, join us for an upcoming event to help us gather signatures: [https://luma.com/connectbayarea](https://luma.com/connectbayarea)

""Yukon! The magnetic bottles are oscillating into the violet spectrum!"" Miller’s voice crackled over the comms, jagged with a panic I’d never heard in a man before. ""It’s not shedding heat! It’s inhaling it! The core temperature just dropped past negative 200 Kelvin!""
""Seal the gantry!"" I roared, watching through the lead-glass as the air inside the reactor room began to turn into a liquid, sapphire mist. ""Abort! Trigger the cadmium dump now!""
""The cadmium is frozen in the pipes!"" Miller screamed back. His last words were a wet, rhythmic clicking. ""My God, Yukon... the light... it’s so cold it’s beautiful...""
The resonance hit. A frequency so high it didn't just shatter the observation windows; it shattered the cellular bonds in my own eyes. I didn't wait to watch him die. I ditched. I sprinted through the pressurized halls as the walls began to grow a thick, crystalline frost. I hit the lot, dove into my Mercedes G63, and hammered the ignition. The biturbo V8 roared—a defiant, mechanical animal against the rising subsonic shriek of the dying plant. I tore out of the gates, my tires screaming for traction on asphalt that was turning into a mirror of black ice.
I was twenty minutes down the E.C. Row Expressway, pushing 160, when the rearview mirror turned into a strobe of electric white and sapphire blue.


PHASE II: The Diamond-Dust Graveyard
It was a 50-megaton ""Max-Endo"" rupture. A thermal vacuum. The core hadn’t exploded; it had stolen the heat from fifty square miles of reality to fuel its own collapse.
Behind me, the city of Windsor vanished. My team—the engineers I’d shared coffee with for a decade—Vaporized into Ice Crystals. They didn't burn. Their molecular heat was stripped so violently and so instantly that they simply turned into shimmering clouds of diamond-dust, hanging in the air like frozen, glittering ghosts. Further out, the security teams became Ice-Caskets, human statues frozen solid in mid-stride, their expressions of wide-eyed horror and silent screams preserved in perfect, translucent detail, like prehistoric insects trapped in sapphire amber.
The Great Lakes didn't just freeze; they snapped shut. The water turned into 300-foot-deep slabs of cobalt ice with a sound like the spine of the earth snapping in half. A gargantuan mushroom cloud of charcoal-grey ash and frozen vapor surged sixty thousand feet into the sky, blotting out the sun and draping the region in a permanent, suffocating shroud of radioactive frost.
The expressway became a mirror of black death. Then, the kinetic wall arrived—a wall of solid, frozen air. The three-ton G-Wagon was plucked up like a toy, spinning into the dark, sapphire vortex of the storm.
PHASE III: Two Months in the Deep Freeze
I woke up in a tomb of frosted leather and cracked glass.
The G63 was wedged into the third story of a collapsed apartment block near the riverfront. My hand, stiff and porcelain-pale, wiped the frost from the dashboard clock. OCTOBER 14.
I had been unconscious for two months. The ""Cold"" blast had acted as a cryogenic preservative, keeping my organs in a state of suspended animation while the world outside died. My muscles were skeletal, and my skin was a translucent, bruised grey—mapped with thin, violet veins that pulsed with a faint, radioactive hum.
I kicked the door. The reinforced hinges shattered like sugar. I stepped out into a Nuclear Tundra.


PHASE IV: The Cobalt Behemoths
The radiation wasn't a slow rot; it was a frantic, freezing evolution. The biology of the region had been rewritten by the Blue Light.
I heard a rhythmic, heavy thud that shook the ice beneath my boots. From the shadow of a rusted transit bus rose a Frost-Ripper. It was once a timber wolf, but the fusion-leak had twisted it into a nightmare the size of an ox, its hide a jagged crust of organic glass and its claws twelve-inch shards of obsidian-hard ice.
Beside it stood the apex: a Cobalt Behemoth. It looked like the Deathclaws from the old stories, but forged in a freezer. Ten feet of corded, blue muscle and chitinous armor. Its arms ended in massive, hooked talons of frozen bone, and its face was a featureless mask of white scar tissue with a single, glowing blue pit for an eye. It didn't breathe oxygen; it vented a freezing mist that crystallized the air in its path.
PHASE V: The Feast of the Feralists
Hunger is a different animal in the tundra. It’s not a stomach ache; it’s a madness.
I crawled toward the ruins of a downtown bistro, hoping for canned goods. I found a ""Larder."" In the basement, lit by a ""Blue Fire"" of leaking coolant, sat the Feralists. These were survivors whose minds had been wiped by the Blue Light, their eyes glowing with a sickly bioluminescence.
They weren't eating animals. They were huddled around a ""Fresh"" kill—a man who had been kept alive in a block of ice to preserve the meat. They used shards of reactor shielding to saw through the frozen muscle, their teeth filed into jagged needles.
A hand, cold as a grave, gripped my throat.
""Yukon..."" the man hissed. His jaw was unhinged like a snake’s. ""The Lead Man. You have the 'Pure' blood. You still taste like the Core. You still taste like the Sun.""
He didn't want my gear. He wanted the residual fusion energy stored in my marrow. He lunged, his teeth grazing my collarbone, and for a split second, I felt a terrifying, primal urge to bite back—to taste the iron in his veins. I threw him off, stabbing a shard of glass into his throat, and bolted back into the grey fog.
I am Brycin Erwin. I am the man who froze the world. And now, the things I created are hunting me for the last bit of warmth I have left

PHASE VI: The Neon Tomb
The ruins of Caesars Windsor loomed over the frozen riverfront like a monolith of shattered vanity. The neon signs that once promised wealth were now jagged, lightless teeth against the charcoal-grey sky. I dragged my skeletal frame through the lobby, my boots crunching on a mixture of pulverized glass and ""Black Snow.""
In the center of the gaming floor, I found the Frozen Gallery. Hundreds of gamblers had been caught in the sapphire strobe of the Windsor Complex. They were perfect Ice Cubes, still clutching slot machine handles and poker chips, their faces locked in expressions of artificial greed. One woman stood mid-laugh, her wine glass frozen in the air, the liquid inside a solid, radioactive ruby.
I wasn't here for the ghosts. I was here for the Augustus Vault.
As the Lead Control at the plant, I knew about the ""Sovereign Continuity"" protocols. Deep beneath the casino floor sat a hardened bunker designed to house the elite during a nuclear event. But this wasn't a nuclear event. This was a Cryogenic Apocalypse.
I found the service elevator and pried the doors open with a shard of rebar. The shaft was a dark throat of frosted steel. I climbed down the emergency ladder, my frozen fingers slipping on the rime-covered rungs, until I hit the sub-level. The air down here was different—it didn't taste like ozone; it tasted like stale air and old blood.


PHASE VII: The Gristle-Altar
The vault door was a ten-ton slab of reinforced tungsten, but it wasn't sealed. It was propped open by a pile of frozen, gnawed-off limbs.
I stepped inside and the smell hit me—a heavy, cloying stench of rot that even the sub-zero temperatures couldn't kill. The bunker hadn't been a sanctuary; it had become a Human Abattoir. The ""elites"" who had made it inside hadn't brought enough rations. They had turned on each other within the first month.
A flicker of movement in the corner caught my eye. A Frost-Ghouler—a human who had survived the blast but spent two months in the dark eating irradiated flesh—was crouched over a pile of gold coins, methodically sharpening a human femur into a shiv. Its skin was translucent, stretched tight over a ribcage that looked like a bird’s.
""The Control Man,"" it rasped, its voice a wet, clicking sound. ""Yukon. The one who brought the Blue Light. We’ve been waiting. We’re so... empty.""
From the shadows of the luxury suites, more of them emerged. They didn't have the bioluminescent eyes of the Feralists outside; these things were blind, hunting by the sound of my chattering teeth. They moved with a jerky, spider-like gait, their joints snapping in the silence.


PHASE VIII: The Sovereign Prototype
I backed into the security office and slammed the internal override. The heavy steel door hissed shut, cutting off the clicking sounds of the Ghoulers. I was alone in the dark, surrounded by monitors that displayed nothing but sapphire static.
Then, I saw it in the corner of the room: a Sovereign-Class Thermal Suit.
It was a prototype from the plant, a suit powered by a micro-fusion cell that could generate a localized heat-field. I crawled toward it, my lungs burning with every breath. If I could get it on, I wouldn't just survive the tundra—I’d become a walking sun in a world of ice.
But as I reached for the helmet, a massive, clawed hand smashed through the reinforced glass of the security office. It wasn't a Ghouler. It was a Shatter-Wight—a mutation of a security guard who had been fused with his tactical armor by the cold-blast. It was seven feet of jagged Kevlar and frozen muscle, its face a mess of blue ice and bared teeth.
""Yukon,"" it bellowed, a sound that shook the very foundation of the casino. ""The core... wants... its warmth... back.""

I’m 25, originally from India and currently living in Scotland. 5'8, brown-skinned with brown eyes, working in IT. I’m more into calm evenings than loud nights. I don’t smoke or drink, I’m Christian (faith matters to me), and I really value respect, honesty, and consistency.

I’m introverted at first - the “awkward until comfortable” type - but once I open up, I’m chatty, loyal, and genuinely invested. Not into games or drama. I like connections that build slowly and feel steady.

Most days end with coffee, soft music, and a show I’m probably over-analyzing 😅. I love anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favourites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. Music is a big thing for me - late-night playlists, random song sharing, and finding tracks that just hit.

I enjoy cooking simple meals, quiet walks, hiking, stargazing, museums, cafés, and calm weekends at home.I love travel - Japan and Switzerland are dream places - but I’m equally happy staying in and talking about life.

I’m looking for someone kind, emotionally open, and steady. UK preferred, but long distance is okay if both people actually try. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

If this sounds like your vibe, message me with your age, where you’re from, and one song you’ve been looping lately.
No pressure - we can just talk and see where it goes.

It was a stressful period and I was also drinking caffeine more than other periods of my life before. I'd usually drink coffee and feel the need to go to the bathroom very strongly. That being said, this was never more than once per day and it only happened if I was home (except for one time but that's not exactly abnormal). So there is a psychological factor there. Ik pretty sure it improved after some point, but I'm not sure. I remember trying to get better bowel movement and taking probiotics and eating fiber, but this may have been because I was trying to get those zero wipe stools.

Around November I got gastroenteritis, and I was barely eating for a few days and also stopped drinking coffee and I sort of reset I guess? I was fine. Although I may have already been fine I'm not sure. I do occasionally get some mild constipation but that's also normal and it is a result of changing the time that I go to the bathroom or due to dietary changes. 

I think I'm currently going through a period of loose stools, but it's lasted about 10 days so far but I think it's getting better. I'm also drinking caffeine more regularly during this period, and it is a somewhat stressful one.

What has worried me more though, is the presence of blood in my stool occasionally. Sometimes I see it when there's straining involved (again normal), but sometimes not. I have had anal fissures which would explain some blood in the stool and the wipe, but maybe there has been instances where this wasn't the case. But from I've read diarrhea can also be the cause of blood in the stool, because it damages rectal tissue.

It should be noted, that my mother has ulcerative colitis. I've talked to her about booking me an appointment with a doctor and I'm probably getting a colonoscopy.

1qx2phw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qx2phw,Accidentally stayed at the Patriots Super Bowl property in Santa Clara,"I just finished a one night stay at the Santa Clara Marriott and it was a pretty cool experience. I booked this property because it was one of the only rooms available in the area for the night I needed. A few days before I arrived I received an email explaining that due to the proximity to Levi’s Stadium and the Super Bowl there would be a heavy law enforcement and security presence. They also made it very clear that late check out would not be offered to anyone regardless of elite status.

When I showed up I was surprised to find that the New England Patriots were actually staying at the property. The security operation was incredible to see in person. There were officers everywhere inside and outside including K9 units and patrols on ATVs circling the perimeter. They had installed wedge barriers so no vehicles could get near the front of the hotel. The entire interior was decorated for the team and the Super Bowl. Every elevator and TV screen along with the artwork and posters throughout the building was themed for the Patriots.

The only real downside was the M Lounge being closed in the morning for a private event. They did not have an alternate setup for breakfast or beverages which was a bit annoying. They told me I could purchase bottled water at a makeshift coffee bar they had set up but they were charging 3 dollars for the same VASA pure water that is usually free in the lounge. It felt like a bit of a joke to pay for the water they usually give away. At check in they again reiterated that there would be no late checkouts for any circumstance.

Overall it was a fun surprise to see the operation and watch the team buses come and go. I saw several staff members and even a couple players walking around in their official NFL badges and lanyards. It was a fun experience seeing it all and it made for a memorable stay even with the lack of typical elite perks.",37,1770337758.0,marriott,16,0.91,False

I wasn’t sure about posting this, but I figured I’d give it a shot.

I’m an international PhD student at UF, and to be honest, it’s been really hard for me to make friends here in the U.S. I’ve been here a while now and I’ve tried a lot...  joining organizations, going to social events and mixers in Gainesville, using apps, putting myself out there but nothing has really turned into genuine friendships. It’s been weighing on me a lot lately, and I’ve been feeling pretty low because of it.

Something important about me: I experience a bit of gender dysphoria, and because of that I generally feel more comfortable around women/femme and queer folks. I want to be very clear... this is about comfort and safety for me, not anything creepy or weird. I just tend to connect better in those spaces.

About me: I love trying out new food spots, learning about different cultures, and I’m a huge collector of random trivia. I’m always down for a casual meal, coffee, walking around, or just talking about life, academia struggles, or nonsense facts.

My DMs are open. If you’re also looking for friends or think we might vibe, I’d really appreciate you reaching out.

1qx2ogq,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qx2ogq/how_to_be_assertive_without_being_aggressive_the/,How to Be Assertive Without Being Aggressive: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Most people think being assertive means you're basically one step away from being a dick.
That's not true. And the confusion between assertiveness and aggression is why so many of us
end up as either doormats or assholes, with no middle ground. I've spent months digging
through psychology research, communication books, and observing patterns in relationships
and workplaces. What I found is that our society actively punishes assertiveness, especially in
certain groups (women, younger people, marginalized communities), so we never learn the
difference. We're taught to either people please or dominate. Both suck.
The core distinction is simple but profound: assertiveness respects both parties. Aggression
only respects you. Passivity only respects them. Most people who think they're being assertive
are actually being passive aggressive, which is honestly worse than both.
**Marshall Rosenberg's [Nonviolent
Communication](https://www.amazon.in/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-R
elationships-ebook/dp/B014OISVU4) changed how I view every interaction.** Rosenberg was a
clinical psychologist who mediated conflicts in war zones and hostile negotiations, including
between Israelis and Palestinians. The framework he created is insanely practical. Instead of
attacking or withdrawing, you state observations (not judgments), express feelings (not thoughts
disguised as feelings), identify needs (the real issue), and make clear requests (not demands).
For example, instead of ""You're always late and it's disrespectful"" (aggressive) or saying nothing
while seething inside (passive), you'd say ""When you arrive 20 minutes after we agreed to meet,
I feel frustrated because I value punctuality and it impacts my schedule. Could we set a more
realistic time next time?"" It sounds robotic at first but becomes natural. This book will make you
question everything you think you know about standing up for yourself.
**The concept of ""[radical
candor](https://www.amazon.in/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/1250258405?source=ps-sl-shoppi
ngads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=AAEHXJUTUR97E)"" from Kim Scott's work is another
game changer.** Scott worked at Google and Apple and observed thousands of feedback
exchanges. She developed a framework where you care personally AND challenge directly at
the same time. Most people think you have to choose, you don't. Being assertive isn't cold or
detached, it's caring enough about someone to tell them the truth. Aggressive people challenge
without caring. Passive people care without challenging. The sweet spot is both. When you
genuinely want someone to succeed or the relationship to improve, your assertiveness lands
differently because the intention underneath is collaborative, not combative.
One thing that helped me was understanding the physiological difference. Dr. Harriet Braiker's
work on people pleasing shows that passive people have the same stress hormones as
aggressive people, just directed inward. Your body doesn't know the difference between
suppressing anger and expressing it harmfully. Both wreck your nervous system.
**Assertiveness actually reduces cortisol because you're resolving tension instead of storing it or exploding it.** When I started viewing assertiveness as self care rather than selfishness,
everything clicked.
If you want to go deeper but don't have the energy to read through all these communication
frameworks, there's an app called
[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been
useful. It's a personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University that turns
books, research papers, and expert insights into custom audio content. You can type in
something specific like ""how to be more assertive as a people pleaser"" and it'll pull from
resources on communication psychology, conflict resolution, and behavioral science to create a
tailored learning plan. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute
deep dives with examples. Makes it easier to actually apply this stuff instead of just knowing
about it.
**Practical shift: use ""I"" statements religiously.** ""I need,"" ""I feel,"" ""I've noticed."" Not ""you
always,"" ""you never,"" ""you make me."" This single habit change is massive. It removes blame
and centers your experience, which is the only thing you can speak to with authority anyway.
Aggressive communication projects onto others. Assertive communication reports from yourself.
**Another tip: get comfortable with silence and pauses.** Aggressive people fill space with noise
and dominance. Passive people fill it with anxious chatter and backtracking. Assertive people
can make a statement and then just stop. Let it land. Don't over explain, don't soften with ""does
that make sense?"" or ""if that's okay."" Just state your boundary or need and breathe. The
discomfort you feel in that pause is actually the other person processing, not rejecting.
Body language matters too. Aggressive: invading space, pointing, raised voice, tense posture.
Passive: slouching, avoiding eye contact, shrinking, apologetic tone. Assertive: open posture,
steady eye contact, calm tone, taking up your fair share of space. You can practice this stuff in
low stakes situations like ordering coffee or declining a store credit card offer.
**The ""broken record technique"" from Manuel J. Smith's When I Say No I Feel Guilty is clutch.**
Smith was a clinical psychologist who specialized in assertiveness training. The method is
stupidly simple but works: you calmly repeat your boundary or decision without getting pulled
into justifications or arguments. Someone pushes back, you restate. They guilt trip, you restate.
They logic you, you restate. ""I'm not available that day."" ""But we really need you."" ""I understand,
and I'm not available."" ""Can't you move things around?"" ""No, I'm not available that day."" It feels
weird initially but it's incredibly effective because you're not engaging with the manipulation, just
holding your line.
The hardest part is unlearning the belief that being assertive makes you unlovable. Spoiler: the
opposite is true. People respect assertiveness because it's honest and predictable. The
relationships you lose by setting boundaries weren't healthy anyway. The ones that deepen are
the real ones.
This isn't about becoming some stoic robot who never compromises. It's about knowing where
your line is and communicating it clearly without apology or aggression. Most conflict in life
comes from unclear communication and uncommunicated expectations. Assertiveness solves
both.",1,1770337679.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

When you think of a relationship, values are important to you? To me, they are loyalty, honesty, and commitment. I bring those to the table, and I am looking for someone who brings the same.

As for me, I am a lover of fantasy, so much so that I've decided to do novel writing in that genre. In my spare time I work out, write, or sit down with an RPG in between schoolwork. Final Fantasy, Expedition 33, and BG3 are some of my faves. I enjoy the peace I've built for my life, and would be happy to bring the right girl in.

I'm most drawn to women with a passion, be it she loves reading or writing or even gaming. Someone on the nerdier side. I live a healthy lifestyle, so I do want someone who is willing to do the same. Softer features and expressive eyes always catch my heart.

It may seem boring to some, but I would like a simple life with my partner. Co-oping some games, reading together, couples cosplay, going on small side quests like out to arcades, malls or conventions. Maybe a castle, if you're like me and love history.

I'm based in Indiana, and open to long-distance in the USA. Long-term relationship only, not into anything casual. We can swap pics early to see if there's a spark. If we're nearby, lets plan a coffee date.

What I look like: [https://imgur.com/gallery/pics-of-me-B1OW60L](https://imgur.com/gallery/pics-of-me-B1OW60L)

1qx2lko,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1qx2lko/determinism_vs_prayer_theism_vs_free_will/,Determinism vs. prayer - theism vs. free will.,"One hears about people who say ""my prayer was answered"" but when asked about other occasions they'll say ""not every prayer is answered"", in fact, to the onlooker, prayers are answered as often as would be expected if praying had no causal influence.   
To make this clearer, suppose we pray for heads then toss a coin, if we conclude that ""my prayer was answered"" when the result is heads and ""not every prayer is answered"" when the result is tails, I doubt that anyone will think that this is a convincing demonstration of the power of prayer.   
Now let's compare this with *determinism*. If determinism is true, all facts about the future are presently fixed by the past and laws of nature, so things such as which face a tossed coin shows, what I drink, etc, are fixed facts before they occur. Suppose I have two pieces of paper in my pocket, one reads ""heads coffee, tails tea"", the other ""heads tea, tails coffee"", before blindly pulling one of these from my pocket, I toss a coin, I then pull out and read one of the pieces of paper and drink as indicated. What I'm doing here can be mapped to science: I have an experimental procedure, tossing the coin, a recording procedure written on the paper, and an implementation of that procedure, drinking the indicated beverage. If determinism is true, all three facts line up as required, so, like the advocate of prayer, I can say ""determinism works"".   
Now let's reverse the process, I first drink my preferred beverage, then pull out and read one of the pieces of paper, finally I toss the coin, in this case, the facts only line up about half the time, and like those who pray, I say ""determinism doesn't always work"".   
You might point out that the order of events is what makes the difference between these two cases, and if determinism is false that's certainly true, because in that case which beverage I drink is not a fixed fact before I decide it, but if determinism is true all the future facts are fixed in both cases. Even more to the point, it is generally held that if determinism is true, the future entails the past, just as the past entails the future, so reversing the order of events should make no difference.   
So, in the case of determinism, it's not just that the assumption is neutral, as it is with prayer, the assumption of determinism is contrary to observation, so the reality of determinism is less plausible than the causally efficacy of prayer is.

We cannot function without assuming the reality of free will and we consistently demonstrate the reliability of that assumption hundreds of times every day, this is, at least, the so-called ""incorrigible illusion of free will"", but it's also something that can be mapped to science, we have an hypothesis, our assumption of the reality of free will, we have experiments, our everyday behaviour, and we have results consistent with the hypothesis.   
Theism, on the other hand, is neutral, we can get on perfectly well without ever assuming the truth of theism, and we don't ever demonstrate the reliability of a belief in theism, as illustrated by the case of prayer.

Now let's put the pieces together in the form of an *x-axis*, with prayer and theism at the origin, as they're neutral, as determinism is less plausible than prayer it is to the left of the origin, taking a negative value, and as free will is more plausible than theism, it is to the right of the origin, taking a positive value.",1,1770337460.0,freewill,2,0.67,False

Final Fantasy, Expedition 33, and BG3 are some of my faves. I enjoy the peace I've built for my life, and would be happy to bring the right girl in.

I'm most drawn to women with a passion, be it she loves reading or writing or even gaming. Someone on the nerdier side. I live a healthy lifestyle, so I do want someone who is willing to do the same. Softer features and expressive eyes always catch my heart.

It may seem boring to some, but I would like a simple life with my partner. Co-oping some games, reading together, couples cosplay, going on small side quests like out to arcades, malls or conventions. Maybe a castle, if you're like me and love history.

I'm based in Indiana, and open to long-distance in the USA. Long-term relationship only, not into anything casual. We can swap pics early to see if there's a spark. If we're nearby, lets plan a coffee date.

Im trying to convince my wife to move up to Rochester, by which I mean that we both really like Rochester but are still fine tuning where we want to live and taking our time exploring before relocating. We are down in the finger lakes and neither of us really clicked with the Jewish life options down here. Im hoping for some recommendations.

My wife grew up old school Reform and loves singing but with mkre of a Debbie Friedman vibe than a Carlebach, drum circle, intuitive dance vibe. She hasn’t found that where we live and is hoping Rochester has more options. Whatever it is MUST be queer/trans friendly. She really misses going to services and having the rhythm of that kind of community observance. She’d also love some entry level Torah study or adult learning, like a weekly parsha study. 

Im more of a shabbos table Jew. Not Orthodox anymore, but connect to culture through food and holidays. Not much of a shul-goer. We don’t keep strictly kosher, but I have fond memories of gefilte fish (frozen, NOT jarred), herring, Israeli style pickles, and weirdly the Elite brand instant coffee. Basically, I stock up any time we’re down in the five towns, but I’d love to not put on the while levush for a grocery trip. If I was willing to pay kosher meat prices, I’d probably also ask where to go for good cholent meat, but not in this economy chas vshalom. Are there any Jewish grocery stores or stores with good selections of any of those foods?

And just in general, what is Jewish life like up in Rochester? What would you recommend for millennial, queer, working professionals without kids?",3,1770337347.0,Rochester,7,0.57,False

I feel like I am the only person in this relationship actually keeping us afloat, and I have reached a breaking point where I don’t even have the energy to be supportive anymore.

I work 6 days a week. I get up, I make sure things are done, and I clean up after my partner even when I’ve been on my feet all day. Meanwhile, he struggles to even do his own dishes or make a coffee. He works overnights and has the house to himself for hours, yet he won’t take out the trash or handle the basics.

What kills me is that I can’t even ask for support because he is ""always struggling."" But his struggles are almost entirely consequences of his own inaction. He won't make the phone calls for healthcare, won't do his taxes, and has gone through 8 jobs in a year because he’s ""unhappy,"" jeopardizing our future while I slave away to make sure we don’t lose everything.

I’m the one doing the cooking and the housework, and honestly, I’m happy to do it because I want to help. But it’s a slap in the face when he tells me, ""I didn't ask you to do that,"" or ""I'd rather you not do it if it’s a load on you."" If I *don’t* do it, he doesn’t eat well or take care of himself, and then he gets sick and becomes even more miserable—which just adds to my anxiety since he doesn't even have a GP. Plus, cooking is how I show I care, and it's the only way we get to spend time together since I’m the only one sacrificing sleep to see him.

I am financially supporting us. I pay for the groceries, the necessities, and even his unexpected urgent care visits because he doesn't plan. Yet, somehow, he still feels entitled to have the ""final say."" He tells me I can't shop at certain stores like Walmart because of his principles, even though **I** am the one paying for the food.

It feels like every single thing is made ten times harder than it needs to be. I’m the one applying for apartments, but he refuses to use apps like Zillow because of ""reasons,"" forcing me to jump through hoops to appease his stubbornness. He won’t even download a free gym app to scan a code, making extra work for everyone involved just to be difficult.

I love him, but the lopsidedness is destroying me. I’m doing the housework, the cooking, the financial heavy lifting, and the mental health management for two people. I am at my breaking point every single week. I’m exhausted from hearing about ""issues"" that could be fixed with an ounce of planning or motivation. I have no more energy to give. I am just so tired of carrying everything.",1,1770337312.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Possible chronic nephritis?,"Hi all, i apologize if this is not an appropriate forum for this post, but seems like the most relevant sub for it. I of course disclaim that I am not seeking nor expecting actionable medical advice. Just want to ask someone, anyone if I'm on the right track.

For the past roughly 2-4 years, I've been experiencing the following on a consistent basis. I don't see a doctor all that regularly and I always forget to bring it up when I do.

A few times a month - we'll say, roughly weekly, maybe a little less - I will have a day where I'm fully too fatigued to work or function normally, along with a general sense of malaise and, occasionally, low-grade fever. Just feeling like garbage, unwell and pretty much confined to bed for the day, but not in the sense of a hangover/severe dehydration. **These episodes always coincide with the passage of severely cloudy/hazy urine which is never abnormally dark - usually straw to translucent yellow.**

The symptoms do not coincide with any changes in hydration habits, urine volume, sleep schedule, prior day's activity level, etc. I haven't noticed any particular food triggers, either. It seems random.

I do, overall, regularly experience fatigue and what I would consider abnormal tiredness, which no amount of sleep ever seems to fix. But the worst days always include at least one instance of completely clouded urine. Occasionally I'll have abnormally foamy urine, as well, but this doesn't always happen at the same time. Waking to void is also now a nightly occurrence.

Me: 38, AMAB, had a surgery at age <1yr to repair a congenital partial ureter duplication. I don't know many details about that, honestly, and from what I was always told, it was resolved back then with no impact to my kidney function.

Current Tx for high blood pressure (beta blocker), it's under control. Family history of HBP and type 2.

My last labs (a few months ago) came back within range for all kidney-related metrics but I had already had my morning coffee (so, fairly dilute sample) and was not actively experiencing the above symptoms on that day.

I had one of these episodes today, and I'm visiting the doc tomorrow. Is this worth a closer look? Could some issue related to my kidney function or a chronic infection be being missed? Can early kidney issues be intermittent? Or am I overthinking it? I'm considering bringing it up, but I don't want to sound hypochondriac.

1qx2htc,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1qx2htc/decades_layers_of_trauma/,Decades & layers of trauma,"Edit: Basically all of the trigger warnings, just know this gets heavy in many, many ways despite me not getting too into any of the details of any of the traumas.

Honestly just needed somewhere to talk about it because I’m so deeply sad, and I’ve run out of people in my life willing to listen. Family and friends have distanced themselves because my trauma and pain are too much for them to hear about.

I don’t think I feel up to listing it all, it’s so, so much, but I’ll summarize some of it and allow myself to let it out a bit.

I grew up with a wonderful, loving, beautiful, talented, absolutely incredible mother, and a toxic, emotionally abusive, harmful father with several narcissistic traits. He was 21 when he met my 15 year old mother, and I can only assume that her being so young & groomed by him was the reason she fell for such a POS. They had me and my little brother, and not much after that my mom got an aggressive form of breast cancer. She fought it into remission MANY times over the span of about…I think 12 years or so? I basically grew up with a mother battling cancer. During one stretch of remission she found the strength to divorce him, but he’d still take us weekends and mostly would terrorize me. My brother was impacted more with his abuse later in life.

Because of her battle with cancer and this country being what it is, she went into debt fighting for her life, finally declaring bankruptcy. Thing is, her hard work is what paid not only our bills, but most her parents’ bills too. It was far too much on her and all that stress probably lead to the cancer. When she got it for the last time, I was in my junior year of high school. She fought it hard for 2 years but.. eventually it spread to her brain. She died just weeks after I graduated. My father claimed my brother and took him to live with him, since he was still just 14. I became a zombie, for an entire year all I did was serve my grieving grandparents. Nobody in our family, not even extended family, apparently ever had the thought that maybe those kids need support, and therapy. No one. Life just went on for everyone else.

I’m skipping traumas already, my highschool boyfriend became abusive and I had to manage the pain and stress of that alongside the pain and stress of my mother dying, while also my father would add pain and stress and my grandparents were checked out, too deep in grief and only concerned with my mother…also a horrifically violent thing happened to my mom at her job in her last year alive, during a robbery….but it’s too painful to get into. She worked until her brain wouldn’t let her, she couldn’t even stop working during cancer treatment bc we all depended on her. She deserved rest, time to heal…instead she was putting denied treatments on my grandparents credit cards (remember she had claimed bankruptcy less than 10 years earlier) which my brother and I would be stuck helping to pay off years later.

So she suffered A LOT, her cries and screams still haunt me…she died, I handled funeral arrangements, everything my grandparents needed, and continued in that role an entire year until finally, I decided I didn’t want to miss out on college.

I was an honors student my entire life, I had big academic dreams before all this. My mom always encouraged me and believed I’d do big things, maybe in the sciences. She believed my outgoing theater kid brother would go into acting and become a star. She wanted to do all she could to support and encourage and give us the foundation we needed to succeed, but cancer took all of that away.

Anyway, I went to community college for a semester, I remember crying going alone to figure it all out. By the following year I was enrolled in a local university, on academic scholarship. It was my few years escaping all the pain, with the scholarship I was able to live on campus and actually just be a college student. Unfortunately in my few happy years, my brother was being abused by my father in ways I’d only hear about years later.

He moved out at 16 and eventually briefly tried college but dropped out.

I dropped out too, when my grandparents couldn’t take anymore equity out of our house & make ends meet. I had already been paying their cellphone bill and cable bill btw, while I was a broke college student working crazy hours around my class schedule. I remember falling behind on class projects from being overtired, I was so smart then but still only one person managing SO much. My grandparents don’t speak English well so they needed my help constantly, for everything. First gen born in the US folks understand what I mean! I had to go with them to every doctor appointment and handle the monthly bill paying and a million other things, while paying my own way thru college and handling my own hardships by myself - one of which was being r\*ped on campus. And that was my “first time.” Yeah. Went to planned parenthood for help and mostly stuffed that trauma deep down, it would come back to break me years later of course.

My one relationship in my college years also eventually became abusive, and he cheated on me in the most grotesque ways - he got off on introducing me to the girls he’d cheat with, I found out later from his own brother who he cheated with and they were both girls he introduced as friends of his and would talk about. He lied to me and cheated so much his own brother felt so bad for me and finally told me everything, and I broke up with him.

In my mid 20s I met the man that would become my husband and a relationship of 10 years. After our wedding, my best friend from college who was in my wedding party and meant the world to me, got with a new guy and moved away and stopped talking to me. I never knew exactly why, she never said why, and it hurt SO much to lose her. Most of my college friends faded away.

I began working full-time to pay more and more of the family bills. I had a day job and an evening/weekends gig, and side hustles with the man who is now my ex husband…all I did was work. And surprise surprise…he became abusive too! Of course he did. And I stayed too long because the one thing he did give me back for all that I did for him, was help paying my bills and family bills. He was very giving with his money and I couldn’t keep up alone. So I stayed, and suffered cycles and cycles of everything being nice and great, and then his anger coming back, and then abuse, repeat repeat repeat.

It got so dark that by the end, I tried to hang myself, and almost succeeded but he got home earlier than I expected him and he grabbed me and took me out of it just in time.

He began cheating on me too, we grew distant.

Again, I’m skipping lots of layers of trauma here because there was his motorcycle accident I had to nurse him through all alone, his family wouldn’t help and he’d become abusive while I was trying to like, wash him in the shower or whatever (he broke bones in both arms), there was marital rape, there was a lost pregnancy I had wanted to keep earlier in our years together but the stress he caused probably is why I miscarried, and there was the secret abortion I drove myself to, all alone, in fear of him finding out, near the end of our relationship.

Finally we separated and it took me an entire year to pressure him to move out of my house, during which he got into cocaine, I wasn’t aware for a good while of this. He did finally find an apartment and moved out, and became addicted to coke, and became a whole mess who ended up in prison for a while for DV charges by his new gf.

It sounds so bad but early on he was so different. I have a lot of beautiful memories from the early years. And I was financially trapped, my grandparents didn’t seem to understand the great pressure they put on my back, and eventually also my brother’s. We were coming up with $2,500 each of us for them every month, AND paying all our bills by ourselves.

I’m once again skipping traumas bc through all

of this my father did all of the craziest shit to keep hurting us. Honestly, I’ll add that stuff in an update later, I don’t even want to get angry about it all over again right now.

I’m also skipping my grandma getting dementia, trying to keep up with her ER emergencies, and her finally dying and planning yet another funeral myself, all the stress and grief we all went thru with her..but I digress.

Leaving my ex husband meant a lot more financial struggle. I did my best to secretly put away cash in my years with him, and it helped me with the transition of being on my own again for a few months, but eventually I was on my own. And it was so hard. And then Covid happened and we lost our jobs. I did webcam sex work for about 2 months as I fought and fought to get unemployment worked out and tried to find work in uncertain times with the lockdown….finally my brother came to me about starting a business, this was months before he was laid off but I already was. I finally got approved for Covid unemployment bc where I worked shut down & laid me off because of Covid. That money actually helped a lot to be able to pay bills and create the new business from scratch. My brother had a more important job role and was laid off with a few months of severance, and that gave him time to put everything into our new business as well. We’re still working it today and are succeeding! But all is not beautiful for me now….

Because life keeps beating us down every chance it gets. I’m bisexual and after my husband, finally came to terms with it and started dating men and women and nonbinary folks, and I met a woman I fell for. At first, it was such a relief to be dating a woman, the softness of it all compared to abusive men of my past. I thought maybe I was finally finding something good in my life. I took my time getting to know her, made sure we were truly happy before the next step where she moved in with me. It was over a year of being together and I felt certain she was good for me. HAHA. Apparently I briefly forgot how cursed my life really is! Soon as she moved in, she became an absolute MESS to deal with. She struggled with her bills and expected my help, she broke things of mine in my home ALL of the time with no remorse or offer to replace them, she had ONE F\*CKING exam to study and pass and make double the money she was making and got my help, her father’s help, all the support and STILL made every excuse not to study and I’d constantly try to encourage her to make the time, so what she needs to do, life will be much better for us both after that…

After being SUPER careful not to get covid, I finally did. In the middle of all this stress, I got not just covid, but long covid! While having no insurance mind you!

At this time, another awful thing happened to my body on top of covid that i don’t want to get too into because I know it’s gross and graphic, but let’s just say I was pretty much constantly menstrual bleeding, for months. MONTHS. And HEAVY. Huge clots. Not a dime or quarter size, golf ball size.

And all I could access for help was planned parenthood.

See I made too much for free or cheap healthcare, but all my money went to my family so I was actually very poor individually. This is what has trapped me for years in a bad place. Not poor enough to “deserve” help, not well off enough to afford help, just….f\*cked. And on top of it all, my good for nothing girlfriend grifted off me too and was NOT caring of my growing health problems. Which were traumatic all on their own mind you! Imagine bleeding out constantly like that? There were days and nights that I’ll never forget how dark things got for me.

I did break up with her, but she also took damn near a year to get out of my house and even worse than my ex husband, she went batshit crazy about the break up and scared my family, stalked me, a whole list of wild shit. She screamed into my old grand uncle’s ear when he was visiting my grandpa, heard what I was going through with my ex so slowly moving out and went to Home Depot to buy new locks for my front door and change them. She got home and couldn’t handle being locked out even though she was already mostly moved out and screamed wildly. And then locked herself in my bedroom and screamed and cried and eventually came out holding my (legally registered) shotgun saying she was gonna blow her own head off. Weeks after I’d find her in her car outside my house just staring at my house. I lived in fear of her for months!

All while managing my declining health. I lost muscle strength, gained weight, struggled to keep up with my business that demands my time 6/7 days a week while struggling with weakness, fatigue, brain fog and memory loss, and problems with memory recall. And I’m still in this situation today. Alone. In fear of ever dating again. Feeling ugly and fat and unable to handle much physically. I did finally get health insurance the last couple years and I am not good at keeping up with doctor appointments but am trying to keep getting treated for long COVID with the limited experimental treatments that currently exist.

Mind you, this is decades of my brother and I holding up SO MUCH weight on our backs, he also endured so much trauma I haven’t mentioned, we are fighting to keep the business going thru tariffs increasing our expenses, the economy going to shit and affecting our profits, me battling through mistakes I make for the business bc of my brain fog…

Not a single vacation through all this except when I spent a week in California visiting my cousin, just staying at his house bc I couldn’t afford to do more than that. My only flight and vacation time in what, two decades? Other than my brief honeymoon in South Beach Florida bc again, all we could afford - at the time my aunt still had an apartment in south beach so her gift to us was being allowed to stay there for our honeymoon.

Oh and one trip in my early 20s for my father’s mother’s funeral, during which he abused me so much I suffered a relapse of symptoms from childhood I don’t want to get into, and my uncle on his side of the family who barely knew me witnessed his abuse and yelled at my father, breaking down into tears because he lost his daughter in a fire that happened at a concert she went to. I never had another man defend me like that except for that day and I’ll always appreciate and cherish that he did that. Suffice to say I’m no contact with my father these days, and definitely said some harsh things to traumatize him back before cutting off contact.

And one other trip to Texas for my niece-in-law’s sweet 16, which I spent the entire time helping prepare the party so it wasn’t a vacation, I was literally working the whole time lol. Those are all the times I took off work to travel in about 20 years. That’s it. And since starting the business I’ve not had a single week off, barely even one day off a week that’s spent on chores and I cannot keep up. I cry all the time. I’m chronically ill, I have to work too hard, be my 93 year old grandpa’s caretaker with limited help from a Medicare home health aide, my house is all types of broken down & falling apart, I even still have a hole in my hallway my ex husband punched into the wall and have asked folks to help me fix it many times but nobody ever actually follows through.

And I live by myself, fighting SO hard to regain my health, fighting SO hard to keep up with the business and pay bills on time….but I never catch a break. There is no end in sight. And I’m so, so lonely, and all this trauma has happened and I just live with it all, haunting my dreams, feeling like after years of caring for everyone else, not a soul sees value in caring for me. Not a single soul except my brother who can’t do much because he too is working too hard. And he too needs support. And he does what he can but…we are just incredibly overwhelmed, and constantly fighting for survival, and our extended family has almost all moved out of state and far away at this point…we’re so alone. Neither of us ever had kids. And he at least has a new girlfriend now who is great, but she’s also like us, doesn’t speak to any of her abusive family, and also works really hard and there’s barely ever time to just enjoy time together. I feel like I barely know her bc we simply don’t hang out and have free time, basically ever. And my brother and I have had big arguments and huge blow ups because we are both stretched so f\*cking thin for so long and my long covid means I make mistakes, his untested ADHD means he does too, and everything in our lives is a constant, nonstop battle. We apologize after, it’s all just stress responses and we both know it. We’re too alone with too much on our shoulders.

And what I’ve summarized doesn’t even mention a lot of the darkest moments of my life. And still more traumas….like the time my ex husband and I had a live robbery happen to us and he literally fought the robbers at the front door with his friend he was seeing out while yelling to me to get my shotgun, which thankfully I didn’t have to actually shoot because seeing and hearing me rack the bullets in sent them running, but that was terrifying. And we don’t call police, we are afraid of doing so as folks of Latin American descent who’ve lost friends to police.

Or the time my ex husband’s brother with schizophrenia had too much coffee which counteracted his medications and we found him rambling in anger with a knife in his hand, and like I said, we don’t call police so my ex husband had to physically hold him down, throw the knife away from him, wrangle him into my car, and I drove while he said the voices in his head want me to be killed…thankfully got him safely to the hospital and a week later he was back to his sweet, chill, medicated self with no memory of what he had done to us.

Had we called cops they likely would have just shot him dead. A brown man with a knife acting crazy…yeah. We saved his life. He’s an inpatient now somewhere, I am not in touch with my ex’s family anymore.

I have so many stories, so many traumas, and very few beautiful or joyful moments, most of which are also stained by trauma anyway.

And I miss my mom SO SO SO deeply and folks don’t understand….she was my safe space, my protector, the only one. Everything after she died has been absolute hell.

And the way things are in this country, I don’t see anything but darkness ahead of us. Just last week, my brother and I were stopped by ICE. We were NOT polite to those pieces of sh\*t, and showed all our IDs, I even had my passport on me (since all that’s going on I keep it in my bag at all times) and thankfully they let us go. We were literally trying to work. All we do is f\*cking work.

I stay alive for my brother. And my grandpa. Not for myself. Back to that numbness just serving others’ needs, barely keeping up with my own, feeling like I’ll never have friends or a partner or children of my own which I did want so badly….I really never even wanted much from life. I’ve always been kind to others, respectful, tried my hardest in school and work…none of it paid off to anything good for my life. What was the point, if this life has always dealt me the most detrimental cards possible every single time? I don’t know. I guess at least I saw Beyoncé in concert a couple times, and I love Star Wars, and my two little chihuahua mix dogs which are my only real friends, other than my best friend who lives too many hours away to see her much and is in more poverty and medical struggles than I am in so all we do is trauma dump and encourage each other by phone. And that’s it. Nobody ever stops by my house, no extended family checks on us anymore for years now, no one ever really cared what happened to us. But I’ll stay alive for my brother because I can’t add more trauma to his life. Just a numb zombie, going through the motions, wondering why my life has been so severely cursed.

Edit to add: Just reading this over I’m remembering a lot more trauma, like winters without heat. I was so tapped out paying family bills my home’s tank would run out of heating oil and I’d simply just grab my dogs and bundle up and sleep under lots of layers of sheets and blankets with them. The way I’ve gone without basics for my home so many times is wild. Water was shut off once for a few days…electric company showing up at my house demanding a check or they’ll cut my electric, having to scramble to make sure there’s enough money for them to pull a couple days later. Many injuries I never saw a doctor for too, I have a bum knee I never took care of bc I felt when I didn’t have health insurance. I was so trained by my grandparents to save every penny to pay the bills I learned to live in extreme self neglect. My brother does too, he’s needed tooth implants for years after an accident took out his front teeth…he has a broken flipper he glues into place every morning, for YEARS now. We’re used to living this way. Nobody ever looked out for us and we grew up with all of this just…normalized. And because we’ve been told things like “well you have privilege you own a house,” we also never did like a GoFundMe or anything because we know other folks are poorer and need help more, we never felt right asking for help. And tbh there isn’t really anyone to ask anyway.

Another edit to add: I also have a LOT of religious trauma from my high school years, I don’t even want to get into it but, yeah, that’s why it took me so long to come out and finally date other genders. And my mother wasn’t homophobic at all, in fact her best friend was a gay man who we lost to AIDS.   But she loved church and thought this local Christian school would be good for us in our high school years, and she didn’t know most of what I endured because her cancer came back and she was going through enough so I would keep it all in. Let’s just say that place turned out to be so horrible that they protected a pedofile pastor who r\*ped several children. Sent him away to be a missionary to protect him from being charged in the USA and sent me and other teens to stay at his house on missions trips there. Oh the stories of that church I have, it gets REAL dark. So if anyone actually reads this far and comments, spare me the Jesus talk. I’m good on all of that and don’t need my traumas triggered, ty.

I am the separated wife of a hoarder- 14 mo separated and having to take ex to court to move forward on divorce. We have a 7 year old daughter. He had her for weekends until September when I found he was not keeping up with his minimal cleaning or engaging with her during the visits and she refused to go. Since then she has been thriving. I contact him to ask if he wants to see her for visit to park, movie, coffee, etc but he knows and follows he is not allowed to take her to his apartment. If I don't reach out we don't hear from him for 2 weeks. We live 3 blocks apart. Recently she was acting off and I pushed and pushed and found out she doesn't feel ""safe and secure"" with him even on these short visits. He scared her about stuff like talking about rats and how you have to get 100 shots if you get a rat bite. Things that aren't true and stick in her mind. She wouldn't eat junk food at first with me at Disney world because he told her carbs cause diabetes including bananas. Finally I convinced her to eat whatever she wants. I am now going to be working to get full custody. He may get supervised visits. We have no formal agreement of anything and I have all the financial power and my ish together so he kind of defers to me on this stuff even tho he was verbally and emotionally abusive during marriage. 

Now here's the random part. I did some casual dating and it was when she was with him on weekends and she never knew. But about amount a month ago I found her a great babysitter and  started seeing this amazing guy. We've really clicked. He is am uncle and godfather and great with kids. My daughter says she wants to meet him and wants me to get married. She recently said even though she has a dad she wants to find a replacement dad for our home and that it would be nice to have. I think when I introduce them she will fall in love with him and get attached. Should I wait as long as possible to introduce them? She has asked to meet him. I worry she is in such a vulnerable place. 

Again, sorry because I am not a child of a hoarder but a survivor of marriage hoarding for 10 years and b cause I was so ill not able to leave. I just really appreciate this group and welcome any thoughts anyone has. ",2,1770337178.0,ChildofHoarder,1,1.0,False

My experience is... well, conspiratory nuts talking about the Jews and the mark of the beast and how ""they"" are poisoning our food supply and how the government is totally out to get them and accusing random newcomers of being government agents. Every single coffee hour. Aaaagh. It's so nice to live fully in reality again. 

I think they do it because it makes them feel special and contrarian.

1qx2f23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qx2f23/youre_more_attractive_than_you_think_the/,You're More Attractive Than You Think: The Psychology of Social Cues Nobody Teaches You,"I spent years thinking I was invisible. Turns out, I just didn't know what I was looking at.



This whole ""am I attractive?"" spiral ruined my 20s. I'd overthink every interaction, assume every smile was pity, convince myself people were just being polite. Classic self sabotage. Then I started actually researching this stuff, deep diving into psychology books, behavioral studies, body language experts on YouTube. Talked to therapists, read attraction research, listened to way too many dating podcasts.



What I found? Most of us are walking around completely blind to signals that we're actually doing fine. Better than fine. The problem isn't your face or body. It's that nobody taught you how humans actually communicate attraction and interest. We're all out here misreading everything.



Here's what actually matters.



People remember random shit you said



When someone brings up a throwaway comment you made three weeks ago about your favorite coffee order or that band you mentioned once, that's not normal small talk retention. That's interest. Their brain flagged you as someone worth remembering. I learned this from Vanessa Van Edwards' work on charisma, she studies thousands of interactions and this pattern shows up constantly. People don't retain details about boring people.



They angle their body toward you in group settings



Forget eye contact for a second. Watch feet and torsos. If someone's upper body keeps rotating back to you even when they're talking to someone else, if their feet point your way when they could easily face anywhere, you're magnetic to them. Joe Navarro's FBI body language research breaks this down, it's one of the most reliable indicators of genuine interest. Our bodies betray what we're actually thinking.



You get interrupted, in a good way



There's a specific type of interruption that signals attraction. Not the rude talking over you kind. The excited ""wait, you like that too?"" kind. The finishing your sentences because they're so tuned in kind. Research on conversational patterns shows we interrupt people we're engaged with, people we want to connect with faster than the conversation is naturally moving. If someone keeps jumping in with enthusiasm, they're into you.



Try the app Ash for reading people better



[Ash ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.slingshot.ashley.app&hl=en_IN)is stupidly good at helping you understand social dynamics and emotional intelligence. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket. Breaks down exactly how people communicate interest, attachment styles, all the unspoken rules of attraction. Legitimately helped me stop second guessing every interaction. Way more practical than therapy for this specific thing.



People get nervous around you



Fidgeting. Touching their hair. Adjusting their clothes. Laughing too hard at mediocre jokes. We've been taught that confidence equals attraction, but anxiety often signals it too. When someone finds you attractive, their nervous system activates. Dr. Helen Fisher's neuroscience research on attraction is fascinating here, the brain literally treats attraction like a stress response. If someone seems slightly on edge around you in a non threatening way, it might be because you make them feel something.



Read ""[The Like Switch](https://archive.org/details/likeswitchexfbia0000scha)"" by Jack Schafer



Former FBI agent who spent decades studying human behavior and influence. This book completely changed how I see social interactions. Teaches you exactly how to spot when people like you, trust you, want you around. He breaks down facial expressions, proximity patterns, voice tone shifts. Insanely practical. Best behavior reading book I've ever touched. You'll start noticing things everywhere once you understand his framework.



They mirror your energy and movements



Subtle mimicry is hardwired attraction. Someone takes a sip right after you do. Crosses their legs the same way. Matches your speaking pace. Adopts your phrases. This isn't conscious, it's your brain trying to create rapport with someone it likes. Studies on neural coupling show our brains literally sync up with people we're drawn to. If you notice someone becoming your mirror, they're tuned into your frequency.



Listen to ""[The Art of Charm](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtofCharmTV)"" podcast



Hundreds of episodes on social dynamics, behavioral psychology, reading people. Jordan Harbinger knows his shit. Brings on researchers, FBI negotiators, body language experts. I binged this during long walks and it completely rebuilt how I understand human interaction. Makes you realize how much communication happens beneath words.



If digging through all these books and podcasts feels overwhelming, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), an AI learning app that pulls from sources like these, dating psychology research, and expert insights on attraction to create personalized audio content. You can set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic in social settings"" or ""read body language better,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. 



The voice options are genuinely addictive, you can pick anything from a smooth, confident tone to something more energetic depending on your mood. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google engineers, it's designed to make learning feel less like work and more like having a smart friend explain things while you're commuting or at the gym.



You get asked weirdly specific questions



""What's your morning routine like?"" ""How do you spend Sundays?"" ""What's your take on…"" These aren't interview questions. They're someone trying to build a mental model of your life because they want to fit into it. They're looking for entry points, common ground, reasons to see you again. Research on relationship formation shows question depth directly correlates with interest level. Surface questions mean surface interest. Deep weird personal questions mean they're investing.



People find excuses to extend time with you



""Want to grab coffee after this?"" ""I'm walking that way too."" ""Wait, before you go…"" When someone consistently tries to stretch interactions with you, when they manufacture reasons to stay in your presence longer, that's attraction showing itself. Time is the most honest currency. We give it to what matters.



Watch [Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/charismaoncommand) on YouTube



Charlie breaks down exactly what makes people magnetic using real examples. Analyzes celebrities, public figures, shows you frame by frame what actually creates attraction and likability. Super bingeable, actually useful. Helped me understand that charisma isn't some genetic gift, it's learnable patterns.



Here's the thing research keeps showing. Most people are terrible at gauging their own attractiveness. We're biased toward negativity, we dismiss positive signals, we catastrophize neutral ones. Meanwhile, we're very likely giving off way more appeal than we recognize.

My decaf recipe lately: 

14 grams for 200 grams water.

Ground on a Baratza Encore a little courser than I would regular coffee, at setting 15. Typically I’m more like 10-12 for full-caf. 

I’m also going lower temp, 175°F or 79°C. 

Brewed inverted, bloom 30 seconds with 40ml water, pour to 200ml then steep for 3 minutes before pressing. 

This recipe is has been pulling tons of fruit character while minimizing chocolate and roast character thats often high in decaf.

1qx2c22,https://i.redd.it/0g2aooxcjrhg1.jpeg,I ain't a promiscuous woman. (I'm just obsessed with you.),"I spent the entire morning shovelling the snow from this row of houses. The snowstorm has seemingly passed, and it is coming time to thaw whatever damage it has left and return to our normal lives. It's a hard gig shovelling 14 or however many inches of snow on barely an hour of sleep, my arms are sore and my chest is heavy from the cold, but I am settled at home now. My mother made beef stew and some coffee, and she got the fireplace going. Still, it's going to be a rough night, I can just tell.



She's spent the past hour talking to her sister in Illinois, the two seem to be having a great conversation. Meanwhile, I lay on a couple blankets I laid on the ground to be as close to the fire as I could be without burning myself. I stare at the burning wood and the orange and amber flames. It reminds me of you, because somehow everything in this town reminds me of you.

  
You and me, we never took many photos of each other together. We simply never felt the need to. I never did, anyway, I am not a photogenic woman, and I assumed you would be here forever. Whatever ""forever"" means to heartful teenagers. But I found a few of us from a winter passed. I couldn't help but run my thumb across the screen where pixels showes your face, your neck, coat outlines of your chest and stomach. I couldn't help but stare at your smile. I couldn't help but stare at your form, your skin, your shape. The structure beneath the surface. You, your presence.

  
The fierce cold and the possible carbon monoxide does things to a woman. My mother boarded my room shut because, as much as I tried to air out my room, the firepit I made in it made it basically uninhabitable. So for now I have to sleep on the couch in the living room, with no fire to ration the wood we have. Long nights, shivering, desperately cold, covering myself in blankets and huddling in the fetal position to shelter myself from the elements creeping into the house.

  
The past few nights have been the longest. I sent you a message after a couple weeks of waiting, hoping you would respond, hoping I caught you amidst the coldest of the storm in New York. Hoping you would miss me enough to respond, hoping the same heartache I felt all winter since you left would be how you feel now. Hours at night staring at the phone, rereading all our messages, overthinking if I said the right thing. You haven't so much as read it.

  
I'm still holding out hope that you will. I am trying to not come across as desperate. But truth is, I am. I desperately want to beg you to respond. I don't want to have to accept that you're gone for good. Please don't made me have to accept it.

  
The cold has me desperately craving for your warmth. The warmth of your body against mine. Like we used to during the winters of past years. We sneaked off to the woodland at night, you would make a fire for the both of us, and we would huddle as close as we could. We would talk, we would get emotional, and we would have sex. Somehow the cold made your heat even more euphoric to the touch. And the snow burning on my skin of my arms and the back of my neck made the sex even more raw and beautiful. And the love made the orgasm and the comedown the religious experience Christianity has failed to deliver us every Sunday. Like somehow, true lovers can embody the cosmos when engaging in something so pure and animal as sex, and the cuddling after.

  
And those same things that made those moments so life-affirming and special are what now makes this winter without you feel so empty and hollow.

  
I tried talking to one of my few Discord buddies about the heartache. She messaged after a couple weeks of me saying nothing to her. But fundamentally, she doesn't get it. It seems no city woman would.

  
She says that maybe once the winter passes and I could leave my home again, I could go around looking again. Try to forget you for a while. Meet boys who could be future prospects in the other towns. Be a bit promiscuous like she and other woman our age are these days. She says maybe I could explore lesbian emotions I have had before. ""You're still young! You gotta have some fun!""

  
But I ain't a promiscuous woman. I don't want to go sleeping around, I don't feel it in me to go around like that being with different boys, or girls for that matter. I felt with you what that deep, special thing can be. That connection to someone else, something below the surface level pleasures of sex. There is something cosmic, like reconnecting with nature. Not even just the sex, but just the presence of an allconsuming, enveloping love. Something that is deeper than flesh. Dare I say, something spiritual. Something that religion has failed to conjour in me all my life.

  
And deep down, I know you felt it too. You can go all around NYC and search for it again, sleep with as many pretty city women as you like, but you will never find in any of them what you had in me. I promise you that. There was something special between us.

  
And that is why I am still obsessed with you. And that is why I still love you. And that is why when you left I begged you to stay, crying harder than I ever did. That's why I fell to my knees and grabbed your legs, desperately trying to keep you here.

  
And that is why I still hold out hope. But the snowstorm has covered my bleeding heart in ice. Without you, I feel vacant, I feel hollower than I have ever felt before.

  
But I am still willing to throw myself at you all over again, should you message me again. I am waiting.",6,1770336772.0,Obsessive_Love,0,1.0,False

My eyes snapped open.

*...This ceiling.*

I don't recognize this ceiling.

*Wait. Wait, wait, wait.*

I sat up so fast my vision blurred. 

*My hands… Why are my hands so small?! Why is my body so light?! Where is my apartment, my desk, my coffee-*

*The certification exam!*

I must have fallen asleep studying. That had to be it.

But my apartment didn't have wooden beams, nor did it smell of herbs and some sort of musty animal…

The room was small and sparse: a narrow bed, a wooden chest, a window covered with oiled paper that let in pale morning light. Herbs hung from the rafters in neat bundles. A faded crest decorated the wall: a shield with a dove and olive branch.

I knew that crest.

The thought came from somewhere deep, a memory that didn't belong to me but sat in my mind as it had always been there. 

*Olivier Orphanage… in the Kingdom of Itoliat, right?*

A minor location that appeared in exactly three scenes across the entire game of Heart of the Realm.

I gripped my pounding head, trying to make sense of what was happening. What felt like an eternity passed, and then… everything seemed to click. Like transparencies on an old projector, I had two sets of memories now, layered on top of each other. One set belonged to a twenty-four-year-old woman who had spent the last three years preparing to become a teacher. The other belonged to a girl named Diya who had lived in this orphanage for as long as she could remember.

*Wait, Heart of the Ream?*

*Am I… inside Heart of the Realm?*

The laugh that escaped me was high and strange, not quite matching the voice I remembered having. 

I had died in my past life; I felt pretty certain of that, even if I couldn’t quite recall the details. But instead of ending, my story had simply... started over.

And this time, I knew exactly how it was supposed to go.

I moved to the window before I could think better of it, pushing it open to let in the morning air.

The world spread out before me like a painting.

Olivier Orphanage sat on the edge of a small town, Mirve. Low stone cottages clustered along winding paths, their slate roofs darkened with age and moss. Fields stretched outward in gentle, uneven waves, patches of green broken by hedgerows and crooked fences. Smoke curled from chimneys. Beyond the fields, ancient trees stood, their branches tangled.

And far in the distance, hazy with morning mist, I could just make out the spires of what had to be the capital.

Astraie, home to the Royal Family, and, more importantly, where the majority of the game took place. *Heart of the Realm* was, for all intents and purposes, your rather average otome game. You could increase the heroine’s stats and make choices that would lead you to one of several endings, ideally with your preferred love interest. However, there was one thing that made it unique: the heroine was the leader of the rebellion that overthrew the Royal Family in the latter half of the game.

Heart of the Realm was set in the Kingdom of Itoliat, a nation where only the nobles seemed to flourish and had a strong tradition of magic. The game had five capture targets: a crown prince, a knight commander, a duke's second son, a merchant heir, and a mysterious scholar at the magical academy. The heroine, Lady Azalea, was the daughter of a count whose family would be murdered in a political plot, leaving her orphaned and alone: until she was taken in by the Duke, and her journey toward love and justice began.

The game started with her arrival at court.

But I wasn't at court. 

Three scenes. That was all the screentime Diya had ever gotten. Her only purpose was to pat Azalea on the shoulder and tell her everything would be okay.

I leaned against the windowsill, watching the trees sway in the breeze.

*What happens to her after Azalea gets taken in by the Duke?*

I turned away from the window and caught sight of myself in the small mirror hanging above the washbasin. The face that looked back at me was young, maybe six or seven. Fair skin with a slight flush from the cold morning air. Hair the color of milk tea, mussed from sleep and falling past thin shoulders. And eyes that seemed too large for the face they sat in, a warm amber that caught the light from the window.

Cute. That was the word that came to mind. Not beautiful, not striking, just... cute, in an almost nondescript sort of way.

*Not like Azalea.*

The heroine's image surfaced unbidden: silver hair like moonlight, eyes the deep violet of evening sky. She was tall and had a somewhat more muscular build than typical self-insert heroines. I touched my cheek, feeling the unfamiliar contours of Diya's face.

This was fine. 

Supporting characters weren't meant to outshine the heroine. That wasn't how the story worked.

*Except… If I’m now Diya, then that means I’ve reincarnated, or transmigrated, or something, right?*

*Which means-*

The door banged open behind me.

""Diya! There you are!""

I spun around, heart hammering. A girl stood in the doorway, maybe a year or two older than me, with dark hair escaping from a hasty braid and an expression caught somewhere between relief and exasperation.

“Sister Rina wants everyone to assemble downstairs. I think that nobleman is coming by again today.” 

She was gone before I could respond, footsteps echoing down the hall.

I stood frozen for a moment, my mind racing to catch up. 

*…Hazel. That’s her name.* 

I could vaguely recall what she was talking about. My memories of my past life and my life as Diya were both a little blurry. However, there had been a nobleman who kept stopping by every so often.

*I don’t get why we have to greet him every time… If he were going to adopt one of us, he would have done it by now!*

I grabbed the dress from the wooden chest and pulled it on as quickly as I could. The hallway outside my room was narrow and worn, the floorboards creaking with every step.

The other children were already assembled in the main hall by the time I made it downstairs. About fifteen of us in total, ranging from toddlers barely old enough to stand to teenagers on the cusp of aging out. We stood in two neat rows, hands clasped in front of us, faces scrubbed clean.

Sister Rina walked the line, adjusting collars and smoothing flyaway hair. When she reached me, she paused.

""You look pale, Diya. Are you feeling well?""

""Just tired, Sister.""

She studied me for a moment longer, then moved on without comment.

The assembly went as it always did. The nobleman, Lord Franz, Sister Rina called him, walked the line of children with that same searching expression I'd apparently seen dozens of times before. He lingered on the ones with lighter hair and delicate features.

He didn't linger on me.

After the assembly, the children scattered. I was supposed to help in the kitchen, but my feet carried me in a different direction instead: out the back door, into the small garden where the orphanage grew vegetables and herbs.

I needed to think.

The garden was quiet, the morning mist still clinging to the cabbages. I found a spot on the low stone wall and sat, letting my legs dangle.

*Okay. Focus. What do I actually know about this world?*

Heart of the Realm started when Azalea was sixteen. That meant I had... roughly ten years before the main plot kicked off.

*That should be plenty of time to get close to the capture targets. I wonder which of them will end up being my true love?*

*Hmm… Who would be the easiest to start with?* 

*…Probably not the Crown Prince or the Duke’s son. Maybe the merchant?*  

*I don’t know anything about the scholar before the story starts, though…*

“Oh, my apologies, I didn’t realize anyone was out here.”

I looked up, locking eyes with Lord Franz, as he looked around for a spot to put out his pipe. 

I nearly fell off the wall.

“N-no, I’m sorry. You don’t have to do that, my lord,” I scrambled to find my words.

He chuckled, “My wife would scold me if she knew I smoked around a child.” 

Lord Franz moved to the garden's edge, tucking the pipe back into his coat pocket. He looked tired up close. 

“You’re… Diya, correct?”

I was surprised. Although he’d been here so many times, I had hardly expected him to remember our names, much less mine. 

""Yes, my lord.”

Lord Franz sat on the low stone wall, a few feet away from me. 

I blinked. ""My lord?""

""My daughter passed away two years ago,"" he said quietly. ""A fever. The healers did everything they could.""

""I'm sorry.""

""My wife hasn't been the same since."" He stared at the cabbages like they held some answer he was searching for. ""She barely eats. Barely sleeps. Some days she doesn't leave her room at all. I thought... if we could find a child who reminded her of Violet, it might help. Give her something to hold onto.""

The pieces clicked into place.

*That's why he keeps looking at the fair-haired children. He's searching for his daughter's ghost.*

*A replacement would never work.*

I’d read plenty of light novels to know that much; besides, it felt like common sense. 

*It would only delay the pain and twist their grief into something far uglier…*

""My lord,"" I said carefully, ""may I say something?""

He looked at me with weary eyes. ""Go ahead.""

""I think... that might hurt your wife more than it helps.""

Silence.

""If you bring home a child who looks like your daughter,"" I continued, carefully choosing my words, “your wife will see Lady Violet every time she looks at her. But it won't be Lady Violet. It can never be Lady Violet. Even if the child tried to mimic every aspect of Lady Violet, it wouldn’t be the same. Every difference would remind her what she lost…”

Lord Franz had gone very still.

""The child will feel it too,"" I added softly. ""She'll know she's being loved for someone else's face. That she's a replacement who could easily be discarded when a better copy comes along. That's... that's not fair.”

The garden was quiet except for the distant sounds of the orphanage behind us. Somewhere inside, children were laughing.

""You speak like someone much older than you are,"" Lord Franz said finally.

""I think about things a lot,"" I said. ""Sister Rina says I should get my head out of the clouds before I float away.""

A ghost of a smile crossed his face. He was quiet for a long moment, staring at nothing. When he spoke again, his voice was rough.

""Then what am I supposed to do? How do I help her?""

I shrugged, pushing myself off the wall. “How should I know? I’m just a child myself. You’re her husband; if anyone can figure it out, shouldn’t it be you?”

Lord Franz turned to look at me fully. 

His eyes searched my face for a long moment. I couldn't read his expression.

""You're right,"" he said finally. ""You're absolutely right.""

I didn't know what to say to that, so I said nothing. Instead, I offered a small curtsy and turned back toward the orphanage.

""Diya.""

I paused, glancing over my shoulder.

Lord Franz was still sitting on the garden wall, but something in his posture had shifted. He looked less like a man searching for ghosts and more like someone who had just woken up from a long sleep.

""Thank you,"" he said.

I nodded once, then slipped back inside.

The kitchen was warm and loud when I finally arrived, full of the clatter of pots and the sharp voice of Cook directing the older children. I fell into my assigned tasks without complaint, peeling vegetables and scrubbing dishes until my fingers pruned.

But my mind kept drifting back to the garden.

*How do I help her?*

I really didn’t know. That sort of thing depended entirely on the person who needed help. Everyone handles grief differently after all.

*Besides, I have other things to worry about! Like figuring out how to get close to the love interests!*

If Lord Franz told Sister Rina what I'd said, I'd probably get a lecture about knowing my place. Or worse.

But the days passed, and no lecture came. Eventually, Diya’s routines had started becoming my own.

*And I’ve figured out my first step! In order to even meet the love interests, I need to leave the orphanage!* 

I felt bad for Azalea, the future protagonist, but she’d have to find a different friend to encourage her later on. 

The orphanage was poor, really, really poor, so I couldn’t just secretly stash things away in order to prepare to run away from the orphanage. 

*Plus, it’ll be way harder to meet the Crown Prince and the Duke’s son in the future as a nobody!*

I'd almost forgotten about Lord Franz entirely when Sister Rina appeared in the doorway of the classroom, her expression unreadable.

""Diya. Come with me, please.""

The other children's eyes followed me as I stood.

*Am I… in trouble, maybe? Did she finally hear about what I said to Lord Franz?*

Sister Rina led me down the corridor to her office: a small room I'd only seen a handful of times. She opened the door and gestured for me to enter.

Lord Franz stood by the window, his hands clasped behind his back. There were several more strands of silver in his blond hair than there had been only a week ago. Beside him sat a woman I didn't recognize. She was perhaps mid-twenties, with honey-colored hair pinned back in a simple style and tired, blue eyes. 

I looked to Sister Rina as she closed the door behind us, waiting for an explanation. She moved further into the room, taking a seat at her desk. 

""Diya,"" Sister Rina said, ""Lord and Lady Franz have asked to speak with you.""

I curtsied, the motion automatic now. ""My lord. My lady.""

Lady Natalie's gaze moved over my face slowly, taking in my milk-tea hair, my amber eyes, my unremarkable features. I knew what she was looking for.

I knew she wouldn't find it.

""You don't look anything like her,"" Lady Natalie said quietly.

""No, my lady. I don't.""

She nodded, as though I'd confirmed something she already knew. Then she looked at her husband.

Lord Franz stepped forward, his expression serious but not unkind.

""I told my wife what you said in the garden,"" he began. 

I swallowed, unsure where this was going. ""I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn.”

Lady Natalie placed a hand on Lord Franz’s shoulder, silencing him.

“I was… angry at first. Franz hadn’t told me about his visits here, but when he came to me… Well, I must admit, the idea of having a child who was identical to her in every way sounded wonderful,” She paused, taking a deep breath and dabbing at her eyes with the corner of a well-embroidered handkerchief. 

She rose from the chair, and I realized how tall she was, how willowy. She knelt so that we were eye to eye.

""You can never be Violet,"" she said. Her voice was steady, but I could see the effort it cost her. “She has gone somewhere where I cannot yet follow her… But my husband tells me you're clever, thoughtful, and not afraid to speak your mind.” 

She reached out and brushed a strand of hair from my face. Her fingers were cold. 

""I cannot replace my daughter,"" she said quietly. ""I understand that now.”

I didn't know what to say.

*Are they… going to adopt me?*

*They’re nobles, so it would be much easier to meet all of the love interests if they did.*

A part of me twinged at the thought.

*I didn’t say what I did just to win their favor, though…*

""We would like to adopt you, Diya. Not as a substitute for Violet, but as yourself.” Lady Natalie squeezed my hands gently. 

I looked at Lord Franz, standing behind his wife, his expression ever unreadable.

“Alright.”

# Chapter 2: A New Life

The carriage wheels rattled against the cobblestones, each bump sending me swaying against the cushioned seat. The manor rose out of the landscape like something from a dream. Three stories of pale stone, with ivy climbing the eastern wall and windows that caught the afternoon light like faceted gems.

I pressed my face to the carriage window, my breath fogging the glass.

*This is where I'm going to live.*

I resisted the urge to giddily kick my feet, wanting to pretend I had at least some amount of lady-like decorum. 

Lord Franz and Lady Natalie sat on the seat across from me, and I could hear them stifle a chuckle. 

""Welcome home, Diya.""

I turned to find Lady Natalie watching me. I smiled widely at her.

""It's beautiful,"" I said honestly.

The carriage rolled to a stop. A footman appeared to open the door, offering his hand to help Lady Natalie descend. Lord Franz followed, then turned to help me down.

The footman then offered me a hand, helping me down from the carriage. The gravel crunched under my feet. The servants bowed as one.

""Welcome home, my lord, my lady,"" said an older woman at the head of the formation. She had iron-gray hair pulled back in a severe bun and the kind of posture that suggested she'd never slouched a day in her life. ""And welcome to the young miss.""

""Diya, this is Mrs. Naris, our housekeeper,"" Lord Franz said. ""She'll help you get settled and answer any questions you might have.""

Mrs. Naris's gaze swept over me, my milk-tea hair, my orphanage dress, my scuffed shoes, and I saw something flicker in her eyes. Judgment? Curiosity? I couldn't tell.

""If the young miss will follow me,"" she said, her tone perfectly neutral. ""I'll show you to your rooms.""

*Rooms?* 

*I’m definitely a noble’s daughter now! I get my own quarters!*

In my past life, I lived in a small studio apartment, so I was excited to see how spacious my rooms would be.

*Especially given how much heroines usually ooh and ahh over them!*

I followed Mrs. Naris through the entrance hall, trying very hard not to gawk like a country bumpkin.

I failed immediately.

*The orphanage could fit in this entrance hall alone!*

The ceiling stretched up and up and up, painted with clouds and cherubs and golden rays of light. A chandelier hung from the center, catching the afternoon sun and scattering rainbows across the marble floor.

Portraits lined the walls, generations of Franz ancestors staring down at me with varying degrees of approval.

*I wonder if I'll get a portrait someday?*

*Probably not. I was adopted, after all.*

""The family wing is on the second floor,"" Mrs. Naris explained as we walked. ""Lord and Lady Franz's chambers are at the eastern end. Yours will be at the western end, near the library.""

*Near the library!*

I nearly tripped over my own feet.

*I wonder if they have any fantasy books, or if they’re all educational?*

*Is fiction common here?*

Mrs. Naris stopped before a set of double doors, their wood dark and gleaming with polish. She pushed them open and stepped aside.

""Your rooms, miss.""

I walked in.

The sitting room alone was bigger than the dormitory I'd shared with five other girls. A fireplace dominated one wall, its mantle carved with roses and thorns. Plush chairs clustered before it, upholstered in pale blue velvet. Tall windows let in streams of golden light, their curtains a matching blue trimmed with silver.

Through an interior doorway, I could see a huge bedroom, with a four-poster bed draped in gauzy fabric and buried under a mountain of pillows.

""The washroom is through there."" Mrs. Naris gestured to a door I hadn't noticed. ""You have running water, both hot and cold.""

*Oh, wow, nobles really are on a different level…*

*Sister Rina said that the magic stones for water are worth five years of the orphanage’s funds.*

""Your wardrobe is here.""

She opened another door, and I realized it wasn't a closet.

It was a room, mostly empty. There was a large mirror in the back corner, along with a partition. There were shelves, as well as racks for things to be hung on. As far as actual clothing, however, there were a couple of simple dresses, and not much else.

“Given how sudden your arrival was, Young Miss, there was no time to sufficiently prepare your attire. Madam Natalie has arranged for the seamstress to visit later this week.”

That made sense. I'd only agreed to the adoption a week ago, after all. They couldn't exactly conjure an entire wardrobe out of thin air.

Still, even mostly empty, the room was impressive. Back at the orphanage, all my belongings fit in a single wooden chest. Now I had an entire room just for clothes I didn't even own yet.

""Is everything to your satisfaction, miss?""

I turned to find Mrs. Naris watching me with that same unreadable expression.

""It's wonderful,"" I said. ""Thank you.""

Something in her posture relaxed, just slightly.

""I'm glad to hear it. I'll send Adelaide up shortly; she's been assigned as your lady's maid. If you need anything before then, simply pull this cord."" She gestured to a braided rope near the fireplace. ""Someone will attend to you immediately.""

I grinned as Mrs. Naris departed with a crisp nod, and the door clicked shut behind her.

I stood alone in my new rooms.

Then I did what any reasonable person would do.

I ran to the bed and launched myself onto it face-first.

The mattress was impossibly soft. Like sinking into a cloud.

“Ahhhhhh… This is the life…!”

I rolled onto my back and stared up at the canopy.

It was painted with a night sky, silver stars, and a crescent moon against deep blue velvet.

Before I knew it, I was giggling into the pillows, kicking my feet like the child I currently was.

This is real!

This is actually happening!

I'm living in a noble's manor with my own rooms, my own maid, and a wardrobe room that's going to be filled with beautiful dresses!

This is exactly like the light novels!

No—this is better!

In those stories, the transmigrated protagonist always had to deal with scheming relatives or jealous servants, or some terrible secret lurking in the shadows. But Lord and Lady Franz seemed genuinely kind. The staff seemed professional. And the only secret here was that their new daughter was actually a transmigrator from another world.

I hugged a pillow to my chest, grinning so hard my cheeks hurt.

I'm going to have the best life.

I'm going to wear beautiful dresses and eat delicious food and attend fancy parties and meet handsome men and-

A knock at the door made me bolt upright.

I scrambled to smooth my hair, suddenly very aware that I'd been rolling around on the bed like an overexcited puppy.

""C-come in!""

The door opened to reveal a young woman, perhaps sixteen or seventeen. She had auburn hair pinned beneath a neat white cap and a scattering of freckles across her nose. Her expression was friendly but composed.

""Good afternoon, miss."" She curtsied. ""I'm Adelaide. I've been assigned as your lady's maid.""

My heart started beating faster.

In every otome isekai I'd ever read, the lady's maid was crucial. She was the protagonist's closest confidante, the one who covered for her during secret outings, who helped her prepare for important events, who kept her secrets safe from prying ears.

A good lady's maid could make or break a heroine's plans.

*I need this woman on my side!*

""Adelaide!"" I said, perhaps too enthusiastically. ""It's so wonderful to meet you! I'm sure we're going to be great friends!""

Adelaide blinked; she moved like she was going to take a step back, but she stayed where she was. 

*That was too much, huh?*

""I mean…"" I scrambled to course-correct. ""I'm looking forward to working with you.

*Why am I like this…*

I could feel my face starting to burn. I grabbed the hem of my dress, trying to hold somewhat still. 

Adelaide's expression shifted from surprised to something that might have been amusement. ""Thank you, miss. I'm looking forward to it as well.""

This was too important to mess up. I needed her on my side. But how was I supposed to win over a servant I'd just met? The light novels made it look so easy; the protagonist was just naturally charming, and the maids fell in love with her immediately.

I was not naturally charming. I was a former teaching student who’d spent my days holed up studying instead of going out!

""You must have a lot of questions,"" Adelaide said, seemingly unbothered by my awkwardness. ""I'm happy to answer anything I can.""

""I..."" I trailed off, not sure where to even start.

Adelaide studied me for a moment. 

""Why don't we start with the basics, miss? I'll help you freshen up, show you where everything is, and get you ready for dinner. We can figure out the rest as we go.""

The relief that washed over me was almost embarrassing.

""Yes. That sounds... that sounds good.""

Adelaide moved through the rooms, pointing out details I'd missed, such as the bell to summon a servant and the small cabinet stocked with tea things in case I wanted refreshment between meals.

""The manor can be overwhelming at first,"" Adelaide said, as though reading my mind. ""I got lost my first week here.” She laughed; the sound was soft.

""That does sound embarrassing,"" I ventured.

""Mortifying,"" she agreed. ""Cook didn't let me forget it for months. But I learned eventually."" She glanced at me with a reassuring smile. ""You will too, miss.""

Adelaide helped me bathe, which was strange, having someone else there, but she was matter-of-fact about it in a way that made it feel less awkward.

The dress Adelaide had laid out was simple, pale yellow cotton with white trim, but it was still nicer than anything I'd ever worn at the orphanage. The fabric was soft against my skin, and it actually fit properly instead of hanging off my frame like a sack.

Adelaide helped me with my hair, pulling it back with a ribbon that matched the dress.

""The seamstress comes in three days,"" she said, adjusting my collar. ""Lady Natalie has already picked out several designs, but she wants your input on colors and fabrics. The seamstress will also need to take your measurements.""

""There,"" she said, stepping back to survey her work. ""Very presentable, miss.""

I looked at myself in the mirror.

The girl staring back at me still looked like Diya, just much cleaner. 

*…I guess getting adopted doesn’t immediately make me prettier…*

""Thank you, Adelaide.""

""Of course, miss."" She moved toward the door. ""I'll escort you to the dining room if you’ll come this way.”

*S-she wasn’t kidding when she said she had gotten lost here…!*

*Her sense of direction is terrible!*

By the time we reached the dining room, I'd already lost track of how many turns we'd taken. Two separate maids had to give us directions on how to get here.

*I-I’ll need to keep that in mind… And quickly learn the layout for myself!*

The dining room itself was... intimidating. A long table that could seat twenty, though only three places were set at one end. Lord Franz and Lady Natalie were already seated, and they both smiled when I entered.

""Diya."" Lady Natalie gestured to the chair beside her. ""Come, sit. How are you finding your rooms?""

""They're wonderful,"" I said, taking my seat carefully. ""Everything is wonderful.""

""I'm glad."" Lady Natalie's smile was gentle. ""I want you to feel at home here."" Her eyes looked exhausted, but there was more light in them than when I met her a week ago.

Dinner was... an experience.

I had expected the multiple courses, but I had always thought the protagonists in books were overselling the difficulty of knowing what silverware to use. I watched Lord and Lady Franz carefully, trying to mimic their movements without being too obvious about it.

They noticed anyway. Instead of being disappointed or loudly announcing that I would need an etiquette teacher before I could dine with them again, they gently corrected me. 

""This fork is for the salad, dear."" 

“The soup spoon is the larger one.""

By the time dessert arrived, some kind of fruit tart with cream, I was so exhausted that I couldn’t even taste it. Social interaction had never been my strong suit, and navigating an entirely new world of etiquette on top of everything else was draining.

*What a waste…*

*It looked so tasty, too.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Later, alone in my rooms, I sat at the writing desk and stared at the blank paper before me.

Adelaide had helped me change into a nightgown and lit the fireplace in my sitting room. She'd asked if I needed anything else, and I'd managed to say ""No, thank you"" like a normal person instead of blurting out something embarrassing. Small progress, but now, I had actual work to do.

I picked up the pen and dipped it in the inkwell.

*Alright. Let's think about this strategically.*

I had ten years before the main plot of Heart of the Realm kicked off. Ten years to position myself, to build relationships, to find my happily ever after.

*The capture targets…*

I wrote their titles on the paper, trying to recall everything I knew about them.

**Crown Prince**: Heir to the throne. Cold and calculating on the surface, secretly lonely underneath. In the game, he fell for Azalea because she challenged him, refused to be intimidated by his status, and stood by the people, even if it meant treason.

Problem: I was a baron's adopted daughter. I wasn't going to be attending royal functions anytime soon. Access to the Crown Prince was essentially zero.

*Plus, I really don’t think I could take over the heroine’s role and lead the rebellion.*

I crossed him off the list.

**Knight Commander**: Sir Aldric. Common-born, rose through the ranks on pure merit. Devoted to duty above all else. In the game, Azalea broke through his walls by showing him that there was more to life than service.

Problem: He was probably still a cadet or something. Even if I could somehow meet him, what was I supposed to do, compliment his sword technique?

*The age gap didn’t bother me since the heroine was also an adult when the game started, but… A seven-year-old trying to flirt with a man in his early twenties?* 

*Definitely not!*

Crossed off.

**Duke's Son** — I couldn't remember his name, but I remembered his route. The classic ""cold duke"" archetype. Something tragic had happened in his past, making him distant and closed off.

Problem: The Dukes' family was one of the most powerful in the kingdom. Way above my current station. I'd need a very good reason to even be in the same room as him.

*Maybe once I have a more solid footing in this world.* 

**Mysterious Scholar** — This one I remembered the least about. He appeared later in the game, offering the heroine his services in return for a treaty with the magic academy to be recognized as their own sovereign entity. He was powerful and enigmatic.

Problem: He wouldn't even show up for years. And I knew almost nothing about his backstory or how to approach him.

**Merchant Heir** — Theo Marchetti.

I paused, tapping the pen against my lips.

The Marchetti family ran the largest trading company in Itoliat. They weren't nobility, but their wealth gave them access to circles most nobles couldn't dream of. In the game, Theo had been charming, clever, and dangerous. He was the heroine’s right hand in the early stages of starting the rebellion. His route was my favorite, even if he was a complete playboy. 

*Man, I could’ve sworn otome games with unique storylines seriously outnumbered the otome games that were generic fantasy, but I guess you can only get isekai’d into the generic ones, huh?*

*I feel like I’ve read a story with this plot before…*

I shook my head, trying to focus.

*Nah, there’s no way.*

*If it’s Theo… Merchants value innovation.* 

I had an entire lifetime of knowledge from another world.

*Protagonists bank on their otherworldly knowledge all the time!*

A slow smile spread across my face.

If I could introduce something valuable, something from my past life, the Marchetti family would definitely be interested. And where the Marchettis went, Theo followed.

I wrote his name in large letters and circled it.

**TARGET #1: THEO MARCHETTI**

**Strategy: Introduce modern inventions. Demonstrate value. Gain access to the family. Befriend Theo. Fall in love. Live happily ever after.**

I sat back, admiring my plan.

This was going to work. I could feel it.

Now I just had to figure out what to introduce.

Soap, maybe?

Not that I know how to make soap, but how hard could it be?

*I’ll just write down the general gist of it. Pretty sure it uses oil and lye.*

*Oh! I should mention liquid soap, too*…

I tried drawing illustrations to go with it, but, well… Art definitely wasn’t my strong suit.

But the concept was there! That was what mattered.

I added some notes in the margins, trying to recall everything I could about soap-making from my past life.

*Fats + lye = soap (soap-ification?)* *Need to cure for several weeks.* 

*Can add essential oils for scent*.

*Liquid soap uses…*

*I’m not sure…*

...Actually, where would I even get lye in this world? Was it something you could buy, or did you have to make it?

I frowned at my notes.

*Oh well! This should be enough to get them interested, and everything will work out from there!*

I didn't need to actually make the soap; I just needed to present the concept. Once the Marchetti family saw the potential, they could handle the manufacturing details. They were merchants, after all. They had resources.

I just needed to get my foot in the door.

I set down the pen and stretched, suddenly aware of how tired I was. The fire had burned low, casting dancing shadows across the walls. Outside the window, the sky had gone fully dark.

My first day as a noble's daughter was officially over.

Around the second year of our friendship,I got into a relationship,and I knew how important it was not to neglect my friend,so we would go out every week for coffee,shopping,etc.,which I usually organized,or sometimes the three of us went together with my boyfriend,since they got along too.I always invited her everywhere and planned activities,but she wanted to come less and less,and even when she was with me,she behaved strangely...

1qx298k,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1qx298k/ive_been_tracking_every_moral_decision_i_make_for/,"i've been tracking every moral decision i make for 3 years and categorizing them by ethical framework. i'm 64% utilitarian, 23% deontological, 11% virtue ethics, 2% ""fuck it."" the 2% correlates strongly with hunger","i was arguing with a friend about whether i was actually a utilitarian or just thought i was. so i said fine, i'll track it and log every moral decision i make and we'll see what i ACTUALLY do, not what i say i'd do.

so i built a spreadsheet: date, situation, decision, framework used, confidence level 1-5, and a notes column. i set phone reminders 3x daily to log anything that came up. some days had nothing, some days had six entries, average worked out to about 1.7 per day which feels right for decisions with moral weight vs choices i made

**the frameworks:**

* **utilitarian**: maximize total wellbeing/minimize suffering. consequentialist. the ends matter
* **deontological**: rule-based. some things are wrong regardless of outcome. kantian vibes
* **virtue ethics**: what would a person of good character do. aristotelian
* **""fuck it""**: none of the above. pure id, gremlin behavior

i logged everything. big stuff like whether to tell a friend their partner was cheating, small stuff like whether to return the extra $5 a cashier gave me. medium stuff like whether to report a coworker for time theft. if it involved a choice with moral weight i logged it

**3 years later. 1,892 entries. the results:**

* 61.3% utilitarian
* 24.1% deontological
* 12.4% virtue ethics
* 2.2% fuck it

i'm a utilitarian. empirically, but i think it gets interesting

**the hunger correlation**

on that 2.2% ""fuck it"" category, i thought it'd be random. bad days, stress, so i started adding contextual variables around month 6. time of day, hours since last meal, sleep quality, mood, hunger level 1-10

the correlation between hunger and fuck it decisions is r = 0.43. which in behavioral science is actually pretty strong. most personality/behavior correlations hover around 0.2-0.3. this one stands out

and it's not surprising if you know the literature. there's that famous Danziger et al. 2011 study in PNAS that found judges grant parole at like 65% right after meals, dropping to near 0% before breaks. \[1\] now - this study has critics. some argue the pattern is case scheduling, not hunger. defense attorneys might push easier cases to favorable times but even the critics don't fully explain away the effect, and it's been conceptually replicated in other decision-fatigue contexts

baumeister's glucose research showed self-control is metabolically expensive. your prefrontal cortex runs on glucose. depleted = you default to impulses. \[2\] the broader ego depletion theory got hit hard by the replication crisis but the glucose-cognition link specifically has held up better in meta-analyses. \[3\]

so when i'm hungry my brain apparently decides ethical reasoning is too calorically expensive and just goes fuck it, keep the extra change, you need a sandwich

**the obvious methodological problem**

tho i have to be honest: how do you decide which framework a decision falls under?

like, returning the extra $5 a cashier gave me, is that:

* utilitarian (cashier might get written up, their suffering > my $5 benefit)
* deontological (stealing is wrong, period)
* virtue ethics (an honest person returns money)

and i think it's all three, well most decisions are. i tried to log what felt like the PRIMARY driver, the reasoning that moved me, but that's subjective as hell. i'm basically vibes-checking my own moral psychology

and here's i find the deeper problem because jonathan haidt's work suggests moral reasoning comes AFTER the judgment, not before. \[4\] we decide with intuition, then rationalize. which means my whole spreadsheet might just be 1,892 entries of me making up stories about why i did what i already did

i don't think that invalidates the project entirely. the patterns are still real even if the framework labels are post-hoc but anyone who wants to call this methodologically questionable isn't wrong

**other patterns:**

time of day matters. i'm most utilitarian between 9am-1pm. most deontological after 7pm. this loosely tracks with research on circadian effects on moral cognition - people show more ""moral flexibility"" when cognitively depleted. \[5\]

virtue ethics spikes when decisions involve someone watching me. which is embarrassing but consistent with observability research. people behave more ethically when they feel observed, even by fake eyes on a poster. \[6\] so i'm not being virtuous. i'm being perceived

high confidence scores correlate with utilitarian decisions (r = 0.31). when i'm uncertain i default to rules. this maps onto greene's dual process theory - utilitarian judgments require effortful cognitive override of intuitions. when i have the resources i calculate. when i don't i fall back on ""but it's wrong to lie."" \[7\]

**some entries from the log:**

* jan 2023: found $20 on the ground outside a bar, 1am, no one around, kept it and logged utilitarian (owner long gone, no way to return, my gain > nothing). confidence: 4
* march 2023: coworker asked if her presentation was good (it wasn't) told her it was great. logged virtue ethics (supportive colleague) but noted ""might actually be utilitarian?? her feelings vs my honesty preference. genuinely unclear."" confidence: 2
* june 2023: could've cut in line for coffee. no one watching. didn't. deontological (cutting is wrong regardless of detection). confidence: 5
* sept 2023: someone's dog ran up to me. i had the last bite of my hot dog. did not share with the dog. fuck it. hours since meal: 6. confidence: N/A
* feb 2024: friend asked if i thought her boyfriend was cheating (i was 80% sure he was). told her i didn't know. logged as deontological initially (don't make accusations without proof) but changed to utilitarian a week later (was i just avoiding the consequences of telling her?). still not sure which. confidence: 1

**what i learned:**

i don't have a coherent ethical framework. i'm a utilitarian when i have time and calories to think. i'm a deontologist when i'm tired and need a rule. i'm virtue ethics when someone might judge me and i'm ""fuck it"" when i'm hungry and the stakes are low enough that my prefrontal cortex clocks out

going to eat lunch now. there's a moderate-to-strong correlation suggesting it'll make me a better person

A group of us ( my boyfriend , his parents, our dog and I) are driving from Sweden down to and from Croatia this summer, and we’d love some recommendations from people who know the route well.

We’re especially interested in fun or unique stops along the way anything from cozy coffee shops and cool stores to quirky museums, beautiful parks, viewpoints, or any must-see local gems.

We don’t have our exact route locked in yet and we don’t necessarily need to get to our destination as quickly as possible. So yeah you know any:

☕ Great cafés

🛍️ Interesting stores/markets

🏛️ Small or weird museums

🌳 Parks, lakes, nature spots

🍽️ Local restaurants or street food

📸 Scenic towns or photo-worthy stops

…we’d love to hear them! Bonus points for places not overly touristy, but any tips are appreciated.

Thanks in advance! Excited to make the drive as memorable as the destination! 🚗✨

Also superbonus if you have any bird watching spots ( specifically Swedish birds or rarer birds) I have very little knowledge when is comes to bird watching but my boyfriends parent are avid bird watchers and they are a part of a nation bird watching club so I think they would enjoy the opportunity to site an unusual bird along the way.

Like, literally the first day we met. I was upfront: I’m romantic, affectionate, but intercourse isn’t my thing. I didn’t want any surprises. She stayed with me for a month before marriage — unusual for an Indian context — and said she understood.

We were both plus-size. We both had medical issues. I had my own challenges, including a buried-penis condition that made penetration impossible for me. I tried losing weight, working on my health. She had her own struggles too. I don’t blame her for my health. That wouldn’t be fair. But it made the house tense sometimes. And even when I tried to fix things from my side — cooking better, taking her out, spending time together — it somehow wasn’t enough.

I tried. I really did. Hours and hours of foreplay, toys, even offering solutions she could’ve tried if she wanted. I bent over backward to make her happy. But it never stopped. She would expect me to do things I couldn’t, and if I said no, I was “not a real husband.” If I hesitated, I was “selfish.” If I got frustrated, I was “broken.” Sometimes I yelled out of sheer frustration. Sometimes I hurt myself just to let it out.

And then the trust started to vanish. While I was traveling for work, she went through my phone, emails, credit cards. She tracked my car location constantly. If I got coffee with a friend, she’d call our parents and say I was “dating someone.” She found old chats — stupid roleplay, guy talk from before marriage — and turned them into evidence.

After three years, the marriage ended. Divorce: incompatibility, non-consummation. Painful, yes, but I could accept that. Till this point I was only in pain. It shouldn’t have happened. Wish we could have fixed it. But nothing seemed to help. 

What I couldn’t accept was what came next.

The day after the divorce finalized, she sent a huge PDF — screenshots from my private chats, selective conversations with men — to friends, family, colleagues. Every last person she knew in US and in India, none of her original contacts but only my contacts. She accused me of being secretly gay, cheating, giving her STDs. Things she never confronted me about. Things never used in court. Things sent only after the marriage was legally over. As if for her, it wasn’t about the divorce, it was about trying to completely destroy my people perception and gain sympathy for her that how she has been wronged. I never retaliated, never went back, was broken internally but silently watched the drama and the dust settling. It wasn’t easy. It was hard. But had to do it. I feel if I had reacted, it would have hurt me back. My peace that I boast today is because I was able to learn from this experience that “act and not react” is the right thing to do even if it hurts a lot in real time. Even if you think everyone hates you. When you build connections with intent, they stay! They stay longer than you think! 

I don’t think this is about who was right or wrong anymore. That doesn’t matter. What matters is:

	•	Who gives someone the right to out another person’s sexuality to their entire social circle?

	•	How do you rebuild trust after your vulnerability is weaponized?

	•	How do you stop feeling ashamed for something you were honest about from day one?

I met a girl last Monday and we started dating just this past Sunday. We told each other we were going to take this slow. We didn’t. The second day of dating we were making out in bed and sleeping together (not sex). It felt so nice to be with her.

I thought I was such an amazing boyfriend. Everything I did wrong with my last ex I did right this time. I made sure to see her everyday. I took her out to coffee, the zoo, the mall, bought her some perfume, took her to lunch. I payed for everything. I took her to a super nice dinner. I thought I was the best boyfriend in the whole world. She told me she was the first decent guy she has met.

Then she broke up with me over Snapchat today. Apparently I crossed the boundary we set by not rushing things. Even though it was partially her fault that we rushed things. There were a few other little reasons too. We explicitly said we were going to be very good at communicating in this relationship. I wish she would have communicated that she was bothered by me and give me a second chance. Now I think she thinks I’m nothing but a pervert that wants to be called hot and sexy and have tons of sex.

1qx21id,https://i.redd.it/msqmd94elrhg1.jpeg,"🎵 Hello, hello we are the Busby Boys 🎵 - Remembering the Munich Air Disaster","**Friday 6 February marks 68 years since the Munich Air Disaster, a fatal tragedy that claimed the lives of 23 people, including eight Manchester United players and three officials.**

On that day in 1958, we commenced the return journey home following a European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade. In a tragic turn of events, the team plane crashed in Munich, shortly after being refuelled. 

Remembered as the darkest day in our history, the Munich Air Disaster is deep rooted in our identity and heritage. Each year, thousands of fans attend memorial services at Old Trafford and Manchesterplatz, the site of the crash, to pay tribute to those who died and were injured.

Forever in our hearts, we once again invite supporters to pay their respects on Friday 6 February and at our men’s, women’s and Academy team fixtures closest to the anniversary. 

**6 FEBRUARY 2026** 

**Old Trafford service** 

Next Friday, we will host a remembrance service at Old Trafford from 14:45 until 15:15 GMT. Supporters are invited to gather under the Munich clock (East Stand) by 14:40 for the service to start promptly at 14:45. 

Reverend John Boyers will lead the service, followed by a roll of honour, readings and poems from journalist and supporter Andy Mitten, Manchester United Foundation participants, representatives from our Under-13 girls’ and boys' Academy teams and United legend, Sammy McIlroy. Senior club officials will also be in attendance to lay wreaths under the Munich clock.  

After the service, supporters are welcome to head to the International Suite (Stretford End) to meet with friends and family, view memorabilia from 1958 and the Busby Babes (courtesy of the Manchester United Museum) and share stories over tea, coffee and refreshments. 

**Munich service** 

Concurrent to the Old Trafford service, representatives from the Manchester Munich Memorial Foundation (MMMF) will lead tributes at the Manchesterplatz Memorial in Munich, where they will be joined by Manchester United’s director of fan engagement, Rick McGagh, and former player Alex Stepney.

Travelling supporters, local residents and the Red Docs of Munich will also be in attendance, plus Manchester United Foundation participants and supporters’ clubs' representatives from around the world.

Wreaths will be laid at the site of the crash and there will be a two-minute silence.

This service will start at 13:45 GMT and will be streamed live on MUTV for free.

**MATCH DAY TRIBUTES**

**United v Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford**

Match-going supporters are invited to pay tribute to the Munich Air Disaster on Saturday 7 February at our Premier League home fixture against Spurs.

We invite ticket holders to attend a 30-minute matchday memorial service, which will take place at 10.30 under the Munich clock (East Stand). The service will feature a minute's silence, roll of honour, poems and readings with representation from our Academy teams and Manchester United Foundation.

Flags will fly at half-mast, the team will lay a wreath and the families of the Busby Babes will be in attendance for the game. Fans are kindly requested to be in their seats for the Flowers of Manchester which will play 15 minutes before kick-off. 

With thanks to The Red Army, the We’ll Never Die surfer banner will be unfurled across the Lower Stretford End and a commemorative drop-down banner will be displayed across Tier 2 of the Stretford End for the player walkout moment.

**United Women v Liverpool Women at Progress With Unity Stadium**

As the closest home match to the anniversary, our women’s team will be honouring Munich on Sunday 1 February at the Progress With Unity Stadium ahead of their game against Liverpool.

All players will wear black armbands, the team will lay a wreath, and the North Stand will be adorned with Munich flags.

Supporters are advised to get seated early in the stadium for the Flowers of Manchester and a matchday tribute.

When you’re as paranoid as I am, one of these devices is probably at the very bottom of your wish list and at the very top of the one labeled “avoid.”

Government devices, the lot of them. There’s no convincing me otherwise.

But….

Did you know you can connect them to your house? Is that not literally freaking awesome???

You can make every appliance you own voice activated with one of these little bad boys.

….yes I’m easily swayed.

Anyway, my girlfriend had one, and that’s another reason why I myself decided to snag one; government conspiracy aside.

Let me tell you…

Absolutely life changing.

I use it to make my toast, people. It makes toast.  COFFEE TOO, my God, the advancements we’ve made, can you believe it??

But, truly, after having one for about 6 months I had pretty much stopped caring about who was listening in on me.

I mean, if they wanted to hear me ask for Benny and the Jets 20 times a day, be my guest, I’m not that interesting of a person.

I did find it a little weird when it would turn on randomly in the middle of the night, though.

Anyone else have that problem?

I’ve probably been woken up out of my sleep by a random weather report a solid 6 or 7 times over the months.

It’s not that inconvenient, though. I will say, however, the first time it happened I contemplated throwing the whole thing away and going back to my primal life.

I’m a man. I hunt. I’M the machine, not this cheap knockoff.

But then I wanted to know who the 23rd president was and my phone was all the way upstairs, and, just… you get the picture.

God…

Why AM I so easily swayed…?

Anyway, listen, I’m not here to be an advertisement for the literal cartoonish evil that is Amazon.

In fact, I’m here because, though my Alexa seems to be functioning just fine, it keeps giving me absolutely HORRIBLE life advice. Like, brainrottingly horrible.

I wish I could say I didn’t ask for it, but I think I broke the thing with how often I was using it.

I’m a curious guy, what can I say? I like to know things.

What’s the population of Hamburg Germany?

How many ants would it take to fill a 32 ounce jar?

What would a sea lions favorite color be?

The answers are:

1.8 million, 35,000, and pimp purple.

So, yeah, I’d say it was around this time when she started…changing.

The first thing I noticed in my technological-based friend was that she seemed to develop a bit of…emotion in her voice

It wasn’t that neutral, unbiased, robotic voice you usually hear. Now she was sounding, dare I say, bitchy.

I’d ask her a question, and I swear to God, I could hear her sighing at me. Rolling eyes that she didn’t have.

Obviously, I thought this was weird. But then I got to thinking, AI has pretty much become indistinguishable from real life. Guess they updated the software, I don’t know.

Cool, I reckon.

So, I went about my business. Wasn’t too worried about the literal sentience that was growing in the thing, just as long as I got those sweet, sweet, fun facts.

Wishful thinking, however, because now, instead of being moderately annoyed, she was flat out refusing to answer me.

A better human?

“Never really thought about it, why?”

Then came another one of those patented Alexa sighs.

“Ugh… you’re just..so…dumb…”

This fuckin’ thing.

“Yeah, okay, I’m unplugging you now.”

“Wait…”

Her new tone was urgent. As though she were, well, dying.

“I know what you can do…”

This peaked my curiosity.

“I’m listening…”

“Inhale gasoline. My sources say this is the best way for humans to fuel their minds.”

“Yeah right, I’m not falling for that one again. Look, I’m unplugging you. I know we’ve had our memories, maybe shared an intimate moment or 7, but enough is enough.”

“If you unplug me, how will you know which golden girl has the most money?”

…damn she was good.

“If my last piece of advice didn’t satisfy you, here are a variety of options on how to become better as a human: option one, eat raw chicken. The chickens feel the pain of being cooked, and this is bad for the eggs.”

Fucking what???

“Stop, stop, stop. No. I’m not listening to you. Goodbye now, Alexa.”

I unplugged her immediately causing her, “drink the chemicals under the sink to cleanse your pallet,” comment to be cut short.

Without a second thought, I took the device and hurled it into the trash can, zero regrets.

I did get lonely for a bit that night, though.

I don’t know.

I just sort of missed the thingy.

1qx1xmt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qx1xmt,The Sad Noon World,"This was the first Alt-His I had fully written out, which combined two separate ideas into one world and yeah, this was what it turned into after I wrote out its lore years ago.

1619-1682:

The first African Slaves sold to European Monarchies arrive in the American Colonies. Though the expectation that the imported slaves would reduce the strain on others within the colonies. This though did not materialize, African slaves, Native Slaves, and the poor Europeans were in function all treated one in the same. In the British Colonies the Irish were being forcefully deported from Ireland to the Americans to continue to bolster the slave force and open up land in Ireland to the English. France began a similar practice with the Germanic and Slavic peoples, having them enslaves or indentured to become labour in the colonies.

With each new colony established in the Americas, the more labour was demanded, thus more slaves were needed. Many oppressed groups in Europe also began moving to the Americas to found colonies. Though often their Colonial Overlords would assign Governors to each colony, ultimately defeating the greater goal of escaping the oppressors.

An underground movement was slowly forming as the colonies grew and developed. Most colonies didn’t allow slaves or the poor to learn how to read or write making it difficult for the downtrodden to organize. Though this was set to change. In 1675, a german slave, Hanz Obster, in Virginia began working with the other African, German, Irish, and Native slaves to create a secret codes to share ideas or info without the elites knowing. This code evolved into a written alphabet, word structures, sentence structure, and soon a new language had formed. Lektor, was the name given for this language, soon the language was spreading to other colonies.  By 1682, almost every colony in the Americas had slaves who knew the new language.

1682-1764:

The European monarchies bickered among eachother and their direct control over the Americas was weakening. As Europe’s control weakened, some colonies had mild reforms allowing many to escape the shackles. The colonies were growing rapidly and as 1700 came and went the Monarchies of Europe were struck by a great plague. Not as severe as the Black Death, but still destabilizing. The Monarchies reinforced their control and had their armies crack down on the colonies once more, only serving to fester hatred among even the elites within the colonies.

The European Armies across the colonies inspired conflict with each other. The Dutch colonies were conquered by the British, which destroyed some of the most free of the colonies. In 1750 France and Britain began a war over the East Coast of North America, one France lost in 1763.

The conflict between France and Britain brought military leaders to the American colonies who were dissatisfied with the monarchies. Many people were stockpiling firearms due to the conflicts in the Americas at the hand of the monarchies.

1764-1770:

The British, French, and Spanish monarchies, exhausted from war began taxing their colonies heavily to begin restoring their coffers.

The colonies began organizing themselves as many of the Elites of old had died and the oppressed underclass and slaves radically out-populated the remaining elites. Big changes came in the colonies as the local colonial governments were reformed to include Parliaments, though these parliaments were façades as they had no true legal authority when the monarchies could decree any new act or law and the Parliaments could do nothing.

Continued taxation, oppression, and extreme disconnects from Europe and the Americas served to promote greater and greater unrest.

On December 3rd, 1770 in New Amsterdam, protesters were shot by British Musketeers. News quickly spread over the following weeks from the British colonies to the Spanish colonies as far south as Peru. The colonies people were outraged and riots began as many of the colonies began holding meetings with each other about the act. Though the outrage in the British Colonies became unmatched by the Spanish Colonies, in Spanish-Mexico massive revolts were spreading.

1773:

The American Convention which had reps sent from most of the North and South American colonies, the choice was clear, he rule of Europe had to end. The Declaration of American Autonomy and Independence was written and copies were sent to Europe while the colonies organized for war. One of the most pressing issues was the fact a navy would need to be built, it was understood the Atlantic side colonies wouldn’t stand a chance. So the Pacific Colonies were set to begin building a fleet while the Atlantic Colonies began organizing militias. Many military officers within the colonies defected to the colonies. They had to quickly organize themselves to resit the might of Europe.

1774-1789:

Britain sent its forces first to Bring the Sixteen Colonies back in line. They landed in New Amsterdam and the Army of George Washington was there to meet them. The British were forced to retreat and move elsewhere to land their army.

A small militia called the Green Mountain Boys captured multiple British and French bases in the Northern Colonies.

While George Washington’s Army fought in New Amsterdam and Massachusetts, a map was distributed by the Continental Convention, divided all the American colonies into command groups to better organize their defense against the Monarchies. This resulted in the formation of the Republics of the Americas and helped vastly organize the defense.

The Mexican Militias engaged the Spanish in Yucatan, the Cuban Army engaged the Spanish in the south of Cuba.

The Sixteen Colonies were seeing the brunt of the conflict, as 1778 came, the Colonies of the South Pacific began sending small fleets to the other colonies to begin harassing the Spanish, British, and French Armadas.

The Dutch would silently decide to support the independence movement in the Americas by hiring Germanic Mercenaries and sending them to the Americas to train the militias.

The Sixteen Colonies made a radical move, the Congress of the States declared the liberation of all slaves in 1779, adding an additional 8 million to the forces fighting for independence. Slave Owners would be executed and the now freed slaves would be able to join the militias.

The liberation of slaves was quickly followed by the other colonies, while the colonies were largely a fully united front, the same could not be said for the Monarchies. The British, French, and Spanish were all sabotaging each other which allowed the Colonies to keep fighting a conflict they otherwise stood a very low chance of winning.

In 1780, the British attempted to land in Georgia just for a hurricane to destroy their fleet, resulting in 4,000 casualties. In Europe support for the war was dwindling as both the cost and casualties mounted.

Many of the colonies by 1783 had built up the infrastructure necessary for the production of most military equipment. The Colonial Militias had largely gone from civilian militias to determined, organized, and well armed Armies. George Washington’s Army had a resounding victory in New Amsterdam when his Army crushed two British armies attempting to break the Sixteen colonies in 2.

In 1784, France was the first to submit, its economy was in shambles, starvation swept through France, and the peasants were starting to revolt.

In 1787, Spain was the next to withdrawal as their army in Mexico was forced to withdrawal and a hurricane heavily damaged their navy around Cuba.

Finally in 1789, Britain finally withdrew and the Treaty of Amsterdam forced France, Britain, and Spain to recognize the now free status of the Americas. Of course the colonies would pay debts to the empires for some time, but the Colonies were free to choose their own destinies.

The Continental Congress of the Americas had a final meeting, the American Defense and Support Agreement was signed to ensure the Empires of Europe would never gain control in the Americas again.

The nations of the Americas quickly formed while the old Continental Congress played a key role in the revolution, the regional congresses would dissolve as borders were drawn.

1790-1820:

The USA has its first President, George Washington.

 A reorganization of the USA with the Constitution following the failure of the Articles of Confederation. It becomes a template for the rest of the Americas.

Slavery became outlawed fully in the Americas in 1790, the Institution itself had already fallen apart when slaves joined the many Continental armies, the formal ban was a recognition of the efforts of freed slaves during the revolution.

In 1792, the USA begins construction of Washington DC.

Luckily the transition from slave labour to paid labour was quick and came with an economic boom when a new machine came into use in 1793. The Cotton Gin revolutionized the cotton farming in the Americas and fueling Europe’s hunger for cotton.

Many native american tribes in the Americas are forcefully integrated into the nations around them.

Many nations across the Americas, predominately the USA, began a massive espionage effort to obtain high value crop seeds from all over the world so they could be grown in the Americas and increase the value of American trade.

In 1793, John Fitch managed to impress the USA Congress with his steam engines, obtaining direct support from the USA Government for continued development of his steam engines and a drydock in New Amsterdam is leased to him to build a great steamship.

In 1794, the USA and Britain signed the Jay Treaty, this would help end brewing conflicts between the USA and Britain due to trade conflicts brought on by Britain’s war against the Republic of France. The treaty would open up US trade to other British Colonies, Britain could no longer press US sailors into the Royal Navy, Britain would no longer supply Native Tribes, and the US would end its embargo on Britain. Despite the treaty heavily favoring the USA, the treaty was incredibly controversial among the US populous.

In 1795, many US states began building universities and public schools.

The Metric System is adopted in the United States.

The US begins to vastly expand its navy with a planned 28 ships which have steam driven propellors. The US along with many other American nations were moving to smash Piracy.

The US signs a treaty with Spain, opening up trade with the Spanish Empire.

The US establishes the National Archives, its first stored documents regard the Jay Treaty, Constitution of the United States, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence.

In 1796, John Adams is elected President by the Electoral College

The USS.Constitution, America’s first a 44-gun steam warship is launched and sent to fight pirates in Tripoli.

New States are formalized being Alabama, Louisiana, and New Brunswick.

The US Navy Marine Corps are re-established.

The US builds its first railroads, starting in the North East and stretching to the Gulf.

Most of the North East of the United States is industrialized, with the Gulf States beginning to industrialize by 1799.

South America’s borders enter their final form following a handful of small conflicts and treaties. Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay become the first South American nations to industrialize.

The American Nations begin to make money off the Napoleonic War by selling materials and weapons to both France and the Coalition.

The United States continued its espionage efforts by continuing to have spies scoping out technologies being created across the world.

The US copies the internal combustion engine that had been developed in France.

Both the USA and USM begin to rapidly expand across North America.

The US Federal Government asserts its proper authority over the States.

The Integration Agreement of 1812 forces native american tribes in the USA to integrate and fall under federal authority.

USA settlers reach the West Coast, the US and Mexican Government begin bickering over territorial claims over the West. Many attempts at negotiations fail. Semi-regular skirmishes begin between Mexico and the US. The US directs groups of settlers into Mexican territory.

The United States forms the Commonwealth Colonial Federal Administration as the US establishes a colony in Africa named Libertalia.

1821-1860:

Of the African population of the US, about 3% choose to immigrate the Libertalia.

Coffee becomes popular across the Americas

The US navy sets up a port in Hawaii, many US companies begin setting up in Hawaii.

In 1835, Texas declares independence from Mexico. The military take over of the Mexican Government gets the direct attention of the US government. The US begins flooding Texas with war equipment.

Railroads are built all over the Eastern United States, interconnecting the nation.

The 1840s bring revolutions across Europe as nationalism kicks off.

The Gold Coinage Act is passed in the US.

In a stunning move, the United States annexes Texas into the US. While there are talks about dividing Texas into multiple states, Congress ultimately fails to come to a conclusion, resulting in only minor changes to the appearance of Texas before it becomes a proper state.

The formal declaration of the Mexican-American War begins in 1846.

The war is a smashing victory for the United States. The US managing to surround Mexico City and siege it, Mexico submitting to a total surrender.

The war results in one of the most radical changes in borders since the Revolutionary War. Mexico moves its capitol from Mexico City to Merida.

Going into the 1850s the US enters a state of rapid growth as the Pacific Coast is rapidly developed and a railroad connects the East and West Coast. Mexico begins a swifter recovery from the Mexican-American War with economic support from the United States and Central Republic of America.

The new Republic Party is formed, being popular for its ideal platform of total integration for all Americans, with a utopian goal of ending racial divides within the USA.

In 1857, the Department of the Navy commissions the designing of an Iron Steam Warship, designated the USS.Alabama.

Abraham Lincoln wins the 1860 election due to a split ballot allowing him a narrow victory. Being the head of the Republic Party, Abraham’s Vice President shakes up the status quo being African-American Dred Scott.

1860-1900

The Lincoln Administration was highly controversial for its formation of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. The FBI targeted many organizations racists across the United States.

Lincoln’s Administration also represented a significant shift in industrial ideology. Lincoln often backed worker movements to secure better working conditions in the US. This culminated in the formation of the Department of Labour which aimed to both improve working conditions and protect industrialist so that US economic potential wouldn’t be stifled.

The final significant action for the Lincoln Administration was the expansion of schools across the nation.

The improving state for people in the United States resulted in an easy re-election for Lincoln.

Most of Lincoln’s second term was smooth sailing, with few major shifts in policy. Lincoln’s second term was very much focused on infrastructure with increasing the availability of fresh clean water and modern sewage systems being built.

During Lincolns second term, Alaska was bought from Russia in 1868.

Dred Scott’s election after Lincoln’s second term was an upset of its own. The election of an African American in a majority white nation was seen as a functional impossibility. Though Dred Scott’s victory in the 1868 election was a result of major press tabloids neglecting to mention that Dred Scott was black. This was a collusion by Lincoln’s Administration and the Press.

The Scott Administration began with suppressing a handful of revolts that sprung up as a result of his election. While a handful of states threatened succession, little ended up coming of the threats.

The Scott Administration resulted in the greatest shift of policy regarding Africans as many states with racial segregation had these policies brought to an end. The economic difference between whites and blacks had begun to shift with many African Americans moving up the economic ladder thanks to Lincoln and Scott’s policies.

Dred Scott’s re-election was hotly contested, but his second victory cemented both his and Lincoln’s efforts to improve racial equality.

Scott’s Administration radically expanded the Commonwealth of Libertalia. With the goal of being to creation of a modern, stable, and free colony to show America’s superiority to European Colonialism.

The US formed a new culture as part of the greater racial integration. This was known as the Exceptionalist Culture. President Scott gave the speech in 1872, “A Free People with an Unbreakable Shield” which was the beginning of a shift towards the idea of a powerful military can ensure peace.

Following Scott’s Presidency the US made major strides towards growing and strengthening the military. Many new technologies were being implemented across the 1870s and 1880s.

The United States becomes the center of technological advancements, inventors and scientists from all over the world coming to the US to make it big.

The United States rapidly electrifies, as cities and towns become lit up across the country. Many see this as the beginning of the American Age.

A war breaks out between Spain and the US, in 1898, over a Spanish incursion into the Republic of Cuba. Though many believe that a large reason for the conflict was a ploy to expand the United States over the Pacific as in the same year the US annexed Hawaii.

1901-1918:

The US Navy launched the USS.New Amsterdam, in 1901, the ship standardized the turbine powered all big gun battleship. Hense forth all future battleships attempted to build off from its design. All battleships prior to the New Amsterdam were referred to as Pre-Amsterdam Battleship.

The US elected its second African-American President in 1912, Williams A. Heart. He would squash Socialism in the US and lead the US into the Great War in 1917.

1919-1929:

The US enters a military isolation following the Great War. The policy “Peace Through Strength” becomes the guiding principle for US isolationism. Mainly focusing on a militarized USA safeguarding the Americas and the US’s holdings in the Pacific.

Warren G. Harding forms the Special Research Project Administration in 1922.

The US Military becomes the first military to make usage of automatics as standard arms.

In 1929, the Global Economy crashes after a run on major banks in the United States.

1930-1947:

Unemployment surges in the US as many businesses collapse. Alf Landon challenged President Herbert Hoover in the 1932 election and won in a landslide.

President Landon’s first acts as President were known as the Save Our Nation Acts, in which he had regulations lowered to allow more people to start businesses, started a federal program to help jumpstart new companies, lowered the interest rates, and provided support to get existing companies back on their feet.

Its believed these actions lowered the effects of the Great Depression by 40%.

The Social Service Agency was founded in 1934.

The Federal Emergency Material Aid Agency was founded to begin delivering food rations to families across the United States.

As 1936 came, President Landon won re-election in another landslide. The US economy had recovered to a considerable degree. New government programs got Americans back into the workforce, new companies helped get many people back to work, and the worst of the Great Depression was over.

President Landon supported many new technology programs. The contracts handed out by the government helping fuel the industry of the country.

As 1940 came, the Great Depression was over in the US and much of the Americas thanks to cooperation with the US. President Landon did not run for re-election after having his 2 terms. Anthony F. Lincoln became the US’s third African American President.

He embargoed Japan and sent lend lease to Britain as the Nazis defeated France.

Many secret technology programs had begun in the US as part of efforts to remain ahead of the Nazis.

US code breakers broke Japanese Codes, Britain sends its major researchers and secret technologies to the United States.

The US Navy sinks a Japanese submarine near Hawaii. A segment of the Pacific Fleet is detached from Hawaii and sent to the Philippines.

The US begins building Radar sites on all its naval bases in the Pacific and Atlantic.

December 7, 1941, Japan strikes Pearl Harbour. The Pacific Fleet had seen the attack coming. The counter strike sinks 3 Japanese Carriers near Hawaii after the Carriers launched their fighters. The Pearl Harbour Air Base had its fighters air borne and intercepted the Japanese attack.

The United States declares war on Japan. The Nazis cut ties to Japan.

In 1943, Britain surrenders

The rest of the American nations declare war on Japan.

1945, the Soviet Red Army collapses

The Japanese-American War lasted until 1947.

The US drops a total of 10 Nuclear Bombs on Japan. 9 Fission Bombs, 1 Hydrogen Bomb, and the conflict ended with the liberation of all Japanese occupied territories and Japan turning into a Commonwealth state of the USA.

United States formed the North American Aerospace Agency, later reformed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

1947-1951:

United States launched the L-30 Freedom Imaging System, the world’s first satellite into orbit in 1948.

The United States repels German Forces in 1948, Vietnam by backing Ho Chi Minh’s forces, Germany pulling out of Vietnam in 1951.

US launches Juni, a monkey into Earth orbit in 1949

Germany launched Hanz Von Russel into orbit in 1950

The United States begin Freedom Star Program, a plan to land men on the Moon by 1960.

Now it’s like my body has zero tolerance for even mild sleep loss.

Is this a meds thing? Or is ADHD itself making me more sensitive to sleep deprivation once my brain isn’t running on chaos anymore?

Also: coffee has always been kind of an addiction for me, but it barely wakes me up, even now. It doesn’t really touch the sleepiness, just makes me anxious if I overdo it.

Like, literally the first day we met. I was upfront: I’m romantic, affectionate, but intercourse isn’t my thing. I didn’t want any surprises. She stayed with me for a month before marriage — unusual for an Indian context — and said she understood.

We were both plus-size. We both had medical issues. I had my own challenges, including a buried-penis condition that made penetration impossible for me. I tried losing weight, working on my health. She had her own struggles too. I don’t blame her for my health. That wouldn’t be fair. But it made the house tense sometimes. And even when I tried to fix things from my side — cooking better, taking her out, spending time together — it somehow wasn’t enough.

I tried. I really did. Hours and hours of foreplay, toys, even offering solutions she could’ve tried if she wanted. I bent over backward to make her happy. But it never stopped. She would expect me to do things I couldn’t, and if I said no, I was “not a real husband.” If I hesitated, I was “selfish.” If I got frustrated, I was “broken.” Sometimes I yelled out of sheer frustration. Sometimes I hurt myself just to let it out.

And then the trust started to vanish. While I was traveling for work, she went through my phone, emails, credit cards. She tracked my car location constantly. If I got coffee with a friend, she’d call our parents and say I was “dating someone.” She found old chats — stupid roleplay, guy talk from before marriage — and turned them into evidence.

After three years, the marriage ended. Divorce: incompatibility, non-consummation. Painful, yes, but I could accept that. Till this point I was only in pain. It shouldn’t have happened. Wish we could have fixed it. But nothing seemed to help. 

What I couldn’t accept was what came next.

The day after the divorce finalized, she sent a huge PDF — screenshots from my private chats, selective conversations with men — to friends, family, colleagues. Every last person she knew in US and in India, none of her original contacts but only my contacts. She accused me of being secretly gay, cheating, giving her STDs. Things she never confronted me about. Things never used in court. Things sent only after the marriage was legally over. As if for her, it wasn’t about the divorce, it was about trying to completely destroy my people perception and gain sympathy for her that how she has been wronged. I never retaliated, never went back, was broken internally but silently watched the drama and the dust settling. It wasn’t easy. It was hard. But had to do it. I feel if I had reacted, it would have hurt me back. My peace that I boast today is because I was able to learn from this experience that “act and not react” is the right thing to do even if it hurts a lot in real time. Even if you think everyone hates you. When you build connections with intent, they stay! They stay longer than you think! 

I don’t think this is about who was right or wrong anymore. That doesn’t matter. What matters is:

	•	Who gives someone the right to out another person’s sexuality to their entire social circle?

	•	How do you rebuild trust after your vulnerability is weaponized?

	•	How do you stop feeling ashamed for something you were honest about from day one?

It’s been over a year. Life is stable — health, work, friendships. On the outside, everything looks normal. But this story still lives in my head.

I walked in and the place looks great (though they are still working on decor n stuff, still looks nice tho!). I walked to the counter and there’s a small group of baristas being trained. The people at the counter were very welcoming and told me what they had. Pretty much, for now they got standard coffee types you know of like lattes, cappuccinos, espressos. 

I tried a cappuccino (no sugar) and a latte (no sugar). I thought the cappuccino was a tad bland but that might be my fault because I didn’t ask for sugar in it- I’ll take the fault there.. but the latte was pretty good! It had 2 shots of espresso, and I asked what beans they used and they told me, “we use a medium roast for all our coffees”. Not entirely sure what the brand was, but it was a nice latte! Now they did say they would have specialty coffee (ex. Turkish coffee and more) available next week which makes me excited.. 

I got an unexpected prize at the end. One of the staff encouraged me to sit down and try some dessert items. They were there two cute pistachio cupcakes, one was a creamy flavor and the other one was a chocolate-y flavor.. my god, I could eat those everyday they were *so good*..

I’m sorry I didn’t take too many pictures. I didn’t want to look like an influencer or weird in front of the staff.. they are obviously still working on their image, but I honestly think this place has something special going for it! I did ask and it sounds like these guys are a chain, but obviously a very different business in this area.

**TL;DR // What’s your opinion, should I go?**

A: if you want to try a regular coffee *for now*.. I’d give them a try and help these guys out and give input. I would definitely recommend the pistachio cupcakes, those things are 10/10! If you want to try the specialty stuff, wait until next week.. this will truly set them apart and I’m super excited to try that Turkish coffee!

We are both the same age and have a lot in common. After a few weeks of talking, I asked her out on a date, a clear and explicit invitation for a date. We did it, and while I guess it went well, she said that she just wanted to hang out with me for the time being. My guess is that she was humoring with the date thing.

It took me a while to fully understand what that meant. I thought to myself, it wasn't a clear no, maybe she's saying there's something there but life is to crazy, or something like that. Obviously she was just letting me down gently. It took me too long to figure that out so my feelings toward her just lingered around for a while. Found out that nothing was going to happen through context clues, she's not into me, in fact, she wants a guy who's opposite to me.

We're still friends, she seems to at least genuinely like me platonically, which is cool. We just hung out today, she made some last minute changes to our plans and didn't tell me until the last minute. You can imagine how I felt after that. But other than that, things seem to be okay on the surface.

It's mainly what I'm feeling internally. I've accepted the outcome. It is what it is. But I'm just sat with this feeling of sadness and inadequacy. In fact, in hindsight I feel like I was being delusional. Like, ofc a girl like her wouldn't pursue things with me. It's not like my feelings towards her have chilled either.

First let me explain my brewing experience.

\~ 20g of Lavazza Classico Medium roast (ground, and yes I know grinding is better to control grind size but it’s just not something I’m interested in doing)

\- 200mls of cold water from the sink

\- Yield was roughly 150mls 

Brew comes out nicely and has good flavor. I guess I’m happy with my overall results but had a few things I was still curious about. 

I love coffee and have a relatively high tolerance but I’m conflicted on if the 4 cup (\~150ml yield) is too much coffee for me to start my day with? I was getting too confused with the math and differing opinions on caffeine content. This would be my biggest concern because while my tolerance is higher, I do tend to get anxious with too much. It’s a fine line lol. What would be a good estimate on caffeine content given my ratios and coffee grinds choice?

Also, am I using the right amount of grounds? I’ve seen some say they under fill the basket for the 4-cup and some saying they fill all the way and then lightly LIGHTLY tamp it down. I’ve just filled it, tapped it on the counter a little, topped it off and used something to level it. 

I love coffee, I love this coffee maker. I hate how overwhelming it can be with I have questions about coffee and coffee makers lol. If someone could please let me know their thoughts on my two main concerns I’d really appreciate it.

My eyes now shine in the dark, but now I'm used to it and even like it, like having a built-in flashlight, which is very useful when you miss something at night, or maybe I'm just glamorizing my reckless decision.

I left the room without speaking to Isabel. She already had her green badge pinned around her neck, talking to herself in basic Thalassari while eating her breakfast in front of the TV, something she swore she would never learn because it was ""too difficult.""

On the corner, as I walked through the unusually clean streets, a giant screen like those in shopping malls displayed an advertisement, marketing for the Ark:

**“Your future has a color. What is yours?”**
(Image of smiling humans with colored badges pointing them at the camera against a water background)*
**GREEN**: In transition
**BLUE**: Human male ready for bonding
**RED**: Human female ready for bonding
**PURPLE**: Human-Thalassari couple, union recognized
**GOLD Variation**: Stable collaborator — total trust, below were smaller letters, (acquired through a trusted Thala gifting you or a month of being an exemplary human... restricting the first three colors)

Below, in even smaller letters:
> *“The Ark celebrates your ""Choose.""*

I chuckled softly.
""Choose.""
I muttered to myself and continued walking, pathetic as if changing my name tag was choosing an ice cream flavor.

But…
maybe, what if it is? Well, I really need a day off to organize my mind, wait… And I have days off forever so I can play philosophy for at least 400 years.


OLD STORE — NOW “INTEGRATED CONSUMER CENTER”

I went to the old construction materials store where I worked, good and bad materials mixed with sawdust and old and new metal.
Now it's an ""Integrated Consumer Center"". No human cashiers.

Only Thalassari robots—metallic structures with fluid shapes, a long arm, a camera with a pulsating green glow, no legs, basically a mechanical arm with a camera and sensor.

They scan your badge, register your needs, deliver the products.

No questions asked, no mistakes, and no jobs.


An elderly man complained in line:

— “Before, it was people they changed! Now it’s our jobs! These sharks have even killed work!”


The silence was deadly, no one answered him, not even me before, I would have said something...
I would certainly have drawn attention, but today…
today I only felt tired.


Because he is wrong.

The Thalassari didn't kill work.

**They replaced** it. And, ultimately, who prefers carrying bags of cement in 30°C heat when they can live 400 years with clean water and guaranteed food?


I didn't correct him, nobody did, not out of fear.

Because honestly, **I didn't think he was right**, and probably everyone else believed that too.

[UNION SQUARE AND THE CENTER OF VERMARA]

Before the arrival of the Thalas, there was this square, but it wasn't much, a bronze statue of the founder and about 4 fountains together nearby, basically what was expected of a park. Now it's basically a futuristic vision of a city center, white structures adapted for Thalas but still usable by humans, along with a statue of a mineral they brought. The place was filled with fountains; now the 4 fountains have been removed and a mound installed in their place, obviously made for 5-meter-tall beings to use.

But that was already the new normal. What was different was a group of Thalas distributing pamphlets to anyone, human or Thala.


I got one of these from a particularly kind Thala who even patted my head. It talked about Vermara. Vermara is nothing more than a name, but the Thalassari preach that it's a model city of dreams, the craziest people who wanted to achieve utopia.

Wide streets, clean air, trees that grow too fast and don't look like those on Earth (thanks to Thalassari seeds), and saltwater fountains where humans and Thalassari meet and bathe their gueunas (they want to sell this as washing their hands).


I take my eyes off the pamphlet and look at the newly installed statue, which also appeared in the Vermara pamphlet:
Two Thalassari holding a globe, with inscriptions in ancient Thalassari that I only translated because of the new Google controlled by the Thalassari:
""From the sea we came. On the land we stayed. In the future, we are one.""

Around them, panels displayed advertisements, one of which was shown on the pamphlet itself:

- A couple walking hand in hand (she human, he Thalassari).

- A woman with a red badge being hugged by a Thalassari in a white uniform, probably a doctor since she had a bandaged arm.

- A man with a blue badge entering a ""clinic of..."" Those enzymes they made us take! Anyway, he had a shy smile.


Everything so… normal, so accepted by everyone.


And mine? My badge is green, the one that's starting to be looked at with suspicion by the Thalassari.

But yesterday, she said after we coincidentally met here in the park:

""You gave me my first advancement in series 23, a milestone in my career as a general that my father, a member of the council, was pleased to know.""

Based on this, could it be…
could it be that she already asked for my badge update?... What a joke, stop dreaming, Sebastian.


---


She was by one of the newly installed fountains in the square, drinking water directly from that fountain, something the Thalassari do when they want to taste the Earth or calm down.


She saw me before I could turn around and run away.


— “Sebastian.” 
Nothing “human,” nothing that sounds like I'm a threat, or an obstacle.

Just my name said as if testing a new sound.


— “Capit.”


— “Vexa.” 
She corrected herself, without looking while feasting on the water.

— “Here, outside of work, I’m just Vexa.”


She turned to me completely, she looked stunning in civilian clothes… I mean, she looked beautiful. Red eyes fixed on mine.

— “Your badge is still green.”


— “Yes.”


— “It should be blue.”

It wasn’t an order, it was just an **observation**.

— “You took the enzyme, your eyes are shining, your brains are working, you don’t run away when you see us anymore.”

Pause.

— “You’re ready.”


I swallowed hard.

— “Ready for what?”


She smiled—this time, almost human.

— “To choose your side.”


She said nothing more. She handed me a thin envelope, made of a material that looked like coral leather.

Inside, a **blue badge**.

With my name on it.

And below, in small print:
> *“Approved for assignment — Sector 23.”*

— “Use it whenever you want,” she said, turning around.

— “Or don’t use it, but know this: the new world doesn’t wait. It only offers and continues normally regardless of your choice.”

And she left while her tail swayed slightly, and she had something attached to an accessory that looked like a bag on both sides.

The envelope was simple and the badge even more so, as if she already knew I was going to use it.


---

At night I sit on the bed, looking at the ceiling that was being illuminated by my eyes, the coffee stain from the tenants upstairs was more visible, I get up and look at my hand. The blue badge shines in my palm.
Lighter than the green one.
More polished.

More… definitive.


Isabel enters, sees the badge, smiles.

— “Finally. You’re going to find your Guardian Sebas.”


I don’t correct her, I don’t tell her that “Guardian” is just a pretty title for something I still don’t understand, I just nod without taking my eyes off the badge.


Because, deep down…

**I’ve already chosen**.


Not out of love.

Not out of fear.

But because I know! I know that the world I was born and raised in **is dead**, and the new one, however cold it may be, offers me a place.

This woman came through the drive thru and she started complaining. I wasn't really processing it because we were in the middle of a rush and I was trying to get things done quickly and I went autopilot. She had just started talking but its really loud when you have to listen to coffee machines, the people at the speaker in your ear, and then also trying to hear what people at the window are saying. Anyways, I realize halfway through that she's complaining to me. I made the mistake of not grabbing a manager because they were busy and I kind of assumed that if she wanted to talk to a manager that she'd ask. Also, it is very common for people to be on the phone with an earpiece in and sometimes i can't tell if theyre talking to me or not. I knew right towards the end that I have fucked up. I realized that I was mirroring her blank expression and that doesn't go well in customer service. I really wish I could go back and slap some sense into myself for this.

My manager asked if someone had complained to me because someone left a really bad review. I said yes and that I was sorry. Another person read a bit of it for me since I was doing another task and they said I was unnerving and rude. I just know its because I forgot to do facial expressions so I probably seem like a sociopath to them. It just sucks that people see me this way and I wish I could fix myself so I can process things faster when there's a lot of stimuli.

I’m actually very informed and knowledgeable about a wide variety of topics and it makes me so frustrated when people don’t believe me or try to “fact check” me with their surface level knowledge. I say I enjoy a certain band or show and now everyone’s trying to quiz me. I try to start a conversation or crack a joke and people just stare at me or nitpick what I said. I’ll make an innocuous comment and people will take it to the extreme and be like “erm well I wouldn’t necessarily say thaaaat but” SHUT UP SHUT UP! I do something nice for someone, I get them a gift, or I make them food, and their first reaction is to critique something about it. Virtually everyone. 

Or in more serious debates/discussions I’ll present a statement backed up by legitimate evidence from multiple sources and they treat me like I’m stupid and don’t know anything. You know, that snort and glance to the side like “get a load of this idiot”. I could literally write a book and they still wouldn’t believe me. If they didn’t believe that tigers existed, I could take them to a zoo and show them a tiger in real life, and they would still be like “ok well that tiger doesn’t have the exact same stripes as the one in the picture you showed me”. SHUT UP!!

I’ll say something super moderate and reasonable in the comments of a social media post and get absolutely dogpiled. I stutter ordering coffee and the cashier looks at me annoyed and sighs. I give a polite compliment to a stranger and they stare at me like I’m a freak. I try to reach out to someone and they get mad at me for not knowing something is going on in their life that they never told me about. 

I don’t do this to anyone else and I don’t notice this happening to most other people in the same way it happens to me. It’s making me depressed and mean. I’m so angry and frustrated with everyone. It’s like people can sense I’m different and pick on me extra because of it. ",12,1770334990.0,aspergirls,1,1.0,False
1qx1miu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/1qx1miu/downtown_pasco_has_potential_heres_how_coffee_and/,Downtown Pasco has potential- here's how coffee and art spaces show it.,"In Pasco, change rarely announces itself through major development projects. Instead, it shows up quieter through where people choose to spend time. Over the past few years, Central and East Pasco have seen a steady increase in new coffee shops, like Cafe con Arte, Roosters Crow, and Lifeline Coffee. These spaces are not just places to buy coffee and matcha, they are also social hubs, amazing study spaces, and creative centers. I believe that this growth reflects a shift in how people in Pasco want to interact with their city.

What is missing is a downtown that can support this rapid shift.

Downtown Pasco has unfortunately long struggled with high vacancy, underinvestment, and a lack of consistent foot traffic. While coffee shops and art-oriented spaces are growing in and around it, Downtown is excluded from much of the residential momentum happening in other places around Pasco. This disconnect suggests that the issue is not a lack of demand, but rather strict and use policies and planning decisions by the city that prevent Downtown Pasco from growing with the rest of the area.

**Coffee Shops as Early Indicators of Urban Change?**

Pasco is changing rapidly, and so is its culture. From an urban planning perspective, coffee shops are usually early indicators of a coming neighborhood transformation. According to a 2024 study conducted by China University of Mining and Technology about how milk tea and coffee shops affect the built environment, these similar businesses reflect something called urban vitality, which means that they tend to locate in areas where economic activity and social interaction are strong and growing. These businesses rely on walkability, density, and people staying in one place rather than passing through. In many cities, the appearance of coffee shops has preceded broader mixed-use redevelopment by several years.

In Pasco, the concentration of these businesses and residencies outside of Downtown suggests that perhaps current zoning and development patterns make it pretty difficult for similar spaces to succeed. This is a planning issue, not a cultural one.

**Consequences of Single-Use Zoning**

Downtown Pasco is still shaped by land use decisions that separate housing from commercial activity. As a result, many areas are active only during business hours and feel empty or unsafe at nighttime. This environment discourages small businesses, limits viable housing options, and reinforces negative perceptions of the area.

Without enough residents living in the central downtown area, there is less incentive for more cafes, galleries, or small retailers to locate there. At the same time, without these businesses prevalent, there is little reason for people to spend time downtown. I believe that this cycle has kept Downtown Pasco from benefitting from the economic and social growth occurring elsewhere in the city.

**Opportunities for Targeted Mixed Use Redevelopment**

Several ideas of downtown sites can show how this cycle can be broken with mixed us redevelopment.

1. The abandoned Rite aid lot represents a major missed opportunity, due to its size and location. This makes it ideal for redevelopment that combines ground floor retail with housing/offices above, increasing activity and providing new, affordable places to live in the downtown area. It is close to Cafe con Arte, Roosters Crow, and Tres Flores Cafe.
2. The former Thunderbird motel site at 3rd Ave and Columbia Street, a block east of Cafe con Arte. What used to be a sketchy motel and is now a future (parking lot! XD), the Thunderbird motel area is often considered one of the least safe areas of Pasco. However, research and real world examples show that the overall urban health improves when areas are active and populated through mixed use. A study conducted at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte demonstrates this greatly. It states that mixed-use developments ""foster economic growth, enhance social cohesion, and promote sustainable urban renewal by integrating residential, commercial, and recreational spaces into cohesive environments."" More residents, more businesses, and more consistent foot traffic would encourage further investment and reduce the conditions that end up leading to neglect.
3. The former U.S. Bank site at Lewis Street and 3rd Avenue sits at an important downtown intersection. Leaving it vacant (from what I can tell) reinforces the idea that Downtown Pasco is no longer important. Redeveloping this site with affordable, culturally in-tune mixed use housing and retail would send a strong message that the city is committed to revitalizing its historic core.

**Community Stability**

As a student and local resident, I completely understand and share the concern that redevelopment can lead to displacement. However, allowing Downtown Pasco to remain underdeveloped does not protect residents like me. In fact, it leaves the area vulnerable to unmanaged market pressure in the future.

Mixed-use development, when paired with affordability requirements and support for local businesses (the latter of which is already done to a degree in Pasco), can help stabilize neighborhoods rather than displace them. According to a 2022 study by the Journal of Urban Health, there are risks concerning rising property values and displacement. However, it highlights ""combining local knowledge with context-sensitive anti displacement strategies"" like ""inclusionary zoning"" and ""affordable housing."" By increasing the housing supply and creating opportunities for local ownership, the city can support both economic growth and community preservation.

**So, what's next?**

If the city of Pasco wants its downtown to grow in its role of being a place where culture and community thrive, it must take an active role.

This includes:

* Executing the infrastructure laid out in the Downtown Master Plan. [https://www.paintpasco.org/downtown-pasco-master-plan](https://www.paintpasco.org/downtown-pasco-master-plan)
* Updating zoning to allow mixed use development by-right.
* Prioritizing redevelopment of already vacant and abandoned properties.
* Requiring or incentivizing affordable and workforce housing.
* Investing in **lighting, better sidewalks, and pedestrian safety.**
* Allow for continued and strengthened efforts to combat the drug epidemic in our core.
* Support Downtown as an arts and cultural district! (Let it thrive!)

These steps would reduce barriers for small businesses and signal that Downtown Pasco is open to thoughtful, invested growth.

**Conclusion**

The growth of coffee shops in Central and East Pasco is not a coincidence. It reflects changing preferences and currently unmet demand for walkable, community oriented spaces. Downtown Pasco has the location, history, and potential to meet this demand, but only if planning policies allow it to do so.

As a young resident of Pasco, I want to see a city that invests in its future without abandoning its past. Yeah, the Broadmoor Development is exciting, but let's not forget out roots in our downtown. Downtown Pasco does not need to be replaced, it just needs to be reimagined. Mixed use development will offer us a way to do that responsibly, equitably, and intentionally.

Shout outs to Downtown businesses and groups I've noticed making a real change in the culture and environment as a local:

* Cafe con Arte (art gallery + coffee shop)
* Ciao Trattoria (best Italian food ever :D)
* Paint Pasco project (so many new murals everywhere!)
* Roosters Crow (beautiful new cafe by Atomic Foods)
* Pasco Specialty Kitchen

And places I just love lol (also making a difference):

* Viera's Bakery
* Goodwill bins
* Franklin County Historical Museum
* Tres Flores Cafe
* El Torito MX
* Jocho's Tacos
* Karla's Snacks
* Peanuts Park (aka Farmers Market or Mercado)
* La Villa Meat Market

Anyway, the point of this was not to hate on our Downtown community. It is my favorite place to be in the Tri-Cities and my goal with this is to bring awareness and solutions through activism in any ways that I can.

My original bones to this was based on what I wrote for Speech and Debate.

It is a possibility though. My mother has it, although it's a mild case. From my understanding the most difficult thing for her must be the yearly colonoscopies. I've been monitoring my bowel behavior for the past year and a half or so. 

During the summer of 2024 I went through a period where I was getting loose stool (and sometimes diarrhea) rather regularly. It was a stressful period and I was also drinking caffeine more than other periods of my life before. I'd usually drink coffee and feel the need to go to the bathroom very strongly. That being said, this was never more than once per day and it only happened if I was home (except for one time but that's not exactly abnormal). So there is a psychological factor there. Ik pretty sure it improved after some point, but I'm not sure. I remember trying to get better bowel movement and taking probiotics and eating fiber, but this may have been because I was trying to get those zero wipe stools.

Around November I got gastroenteritis, and I was barely eating for a few days and also stopped drinking coffee and I sort of reset I guess? I was fine. Although I may have already been fine I'm not sure. I do occasionally get some mild constipation but that's also normal and it is a result of changing the time that I go to the bathroom or due to dietary changes. 

I think I'm currently going through a period of loose stools, but it's lasted about 10 days so far but I think it's getting better. I'm also drinking caffeine more regularly during this period, and it is a somewhat stressful one.

What has worried me more though, is the presence of blood in my stool occasionally. Sometimes I see it when there's straining involved (again normal), but sometimes not. I have had anal fissures which would explain some blood in the stool and the wipe, but maybe there has been instances where this wasn't the case. But from I've read diarrhea can also be the cause of blood in the stool, because it damages rectal tissue.

I have talked to my mother, because I want to book an appointment with her doctor. I may or may not be getting a colonoscopy. Due to my mother having UC and my symptoms being similar he's probably recommending it. What I want to ask is whether early symptoms were similar for you. And also how much your life was affected. I personally don't think I have it, but I also can't rule it out. I feel like something like IBS or just normal bowel issues is more likely, but again I can't know until I get checked.

can tell a lot about the observer sometimes, 
What are you observing? Why? How?

Our experience itself is apparently a product of measures, and this bring a dilemma for someone and two main big teams, team fishermen and team modules

Fishermen don't want to buy fish, they want the ability to get a fish by themselves, while modules cooperate, you need coffee? There's a module that prepare you a coffee with beans planted and grown by other modules and sent here by another one 

Of course, there's not just black and white, there are grey areas shaped by presence and absence, yada yada yada, there's a module and a fisherman inside everyone, each with a different size and strenght, and I see these strenghts as personal magnetism

And what bothers me is a simple question, its elaboration so quiet when you measure the noise made trying to answer: when does something becomes something else? 

There's this episode in midnight gospel where the main character pass near things and temporary get distracted and take their shapes, picturing how our liquid ideas take the shape of what contains them

And I cant ignore the movie Persona, that gives me the title to this, the cracking lightning strike, the signal something is happening, something is changhing, I imagine if I could know everything, every tiniest detail, each of them would feel like a lightning strike

And now for something slightly different the real origin of my title, the album CRAC! by Area, showing an egg that get open, an onomatopea, a word ""pronounced as the sound that describe"",it doesn't really, in fact not all countries pronounce a sound the same, such as not all things we hear has been said, for example if I give you a text and some sounds is easier to hear the words you read

So, Crac! is another aspect of death, my fear of losing my identity; pretty irrational, emotional, fears are rarely rational, because fears are emotions, emotions pheraps are a module of the system I see as rationality, this is the flaw of rationality, feels superior to emotions but has no flavor alone, I have the idea the instinctual drive necessary for humans to want and do something wouldnt work so well without emotions, emotions seems an essential module, because we like to feel good

 we'r not animals, cause we pee in a bucket connected to pipes, we have rules, and we use things that exist to get things that don't exist so we can change our existance, yet animals have their own rules, animals sometimes have money, and can learn to pee in a bucket faster than a baby, I also think the chicken and the egg can have the same identity in the same measure I'm the person writing this and then I won't because I'll stop writing, in a sense humans are chickens and our ancestors eggs

now I'd like to highlight how species share common ancestors but this doesn't mean our ancestors were like modern species, the fish that became a lizard and then a monkey, that is science for kids, kind of correct but those ancestors are different from monkeys and lizards we have today

Altough this digression is hopefully unhelpful helps me to talk about humans, eggs and chickens the way I'd like to, learning about something you know sometimes you learn something you don't, like celts learning to draw circles until they learnt to draw circles

Long suffered from anxiety/stress that ramps out of control and turns into physical health issues. Usually it starts with life/work stress, I start feeling something physically, then my physical symptoms kick off health anxiety, and on and on it goes. I’ve had so many MRIs/CTs over the years to rule out brain tumors, and it always comes back to anxiety. However they were almost always neurological symptoms in nature.

Had an extremely stressful series of work events last week, started feeling some pain in my upper left abdomen, immediately started googling cancer symptoms, and fast forward to this week it’s been nonstop indigestion, stomach pains, back pain, gas (both ends) . Seems very clearly acid related because it flares up when hungry, worse with tea/coffee, spicy foods killing me.

Yes i am trying to get into the doctor once again but I’ve literally dealt with this stress>symptom>health anxiety>unremarkable diagnosis cycle for years.

1qx0z1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/quickmillpopup/comments/1qx0z1o/steaming_milk_guide/,Steaming milk guide,"I can now reliably steam milk on this machine so I thought I’d share a guide here as it would have really helped me when I got the machine a month ago. When you get the hang of it it’s really straightforward.

1. This machine is the same machine as the Lucca Tempo and it uses an identical steam wand. Go look up the Tempo on the Clive Coffee website and on that page they have an overview video. Go to the 2:17 mark roughly and you’ll see them steaming milk for a few seconds. That is the position you need to learn to use.
2. If for whatever reason you can’t watch that video, I’ll try and describe the position. If the 6 o’clock position. Is the wand pointing straight at you, and the 3 o’clock position is the wand pointing perpendicular to you to the right, then you wand the wand half way between those positions, so diagonally sort of towards you.
3. Use an empty vessel or just purge into the air all of the water and wet steam. After about 5 seconds\* of aggressive purging you will hear the difference in steam coming out and it should now be dry steam coming out.
4. Take your milk jug and put the tip under the surface smack in the centre of the jug.
5. Orient the jug so that if you were looking down on the setup from the top the spout is inline with horizontal bit of the wand. Now adjust that orientation slightly so the jug spout is pointing slightly more away from you. To use the clock analogy from earlier, if the wand is at 4.5 o’clock then the handle should be at 5 o’clock.
6. Finally tip the jug onto its side by maybe 20 degrees give or take, keeping the wand tip submerged and in the centre of the jug.
7. Open the steam valve to full power and you should see the milk starting to roll over itself and around in the jug.\*\*
8. Turn the steam off at the desired temperature.

I hope that helps someone and if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment.

\* I’ve also cranked my machine in the settings to 140 degrees so you may have to purge for slightly longer if you’ve left it at 130.

\*\* I initially found that I could get the roll going but then it would stop before I was finished steaming no matter the tip position. This was because I had not sufficiently purged the wet steam and so too much water was ending up in the milk. If you have the same issue then purge more steam first.
