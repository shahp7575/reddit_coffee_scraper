The problem is my ex is still my roommate so I struggle daily to go to work/even eat. So I give up and end up ordering food. This is my only meal of the day. I was sent home early from work today because a coworker accidentally gave me some coffee with lavender in it and didn’t tell me. I’m allergic to lavender and had to take Benadryl but thankfully not an EpiPen. Since I was sleepy they sent me home, in the snowstorm.

I accepted, and the day after, we drank coffee and got to know each other more. For context, we're in the same club and a part of a smaller group within that club.  We've been in that same group since near the beginning of the last semester, I also sit next to him when our group meets once a week and are mostly just acquaintances. I don't want to be too specific, because the thought of him possibly seeing this and knowing this is about him and linking this back to me makes me cringe.  


He asked me very abruptly in the evening on Discord, I was taken off-guard because I had never been asked to hang out with anyone before. I only talked to him once briefly outside of the club, but it was just a single question.   


(I don't have any friends currently, due to my social anxiety, which I've been working towards with my counselor. The one time I talked to him outside of our club was because my counselor encouraged me to help with my social anxiety.)   


I agreed to hang out, and the next day we met up to drink coffee together. We mostly got to know each other more, mainly throwing questions at each other and responding to those questions. I found out that we have quite a bit in common, like interests, hobbies, the same major, etc. We talked for an hour and it was pleasant. He was polite and genuine. It never seemed like he wanted something out of me, nor does he even seem like that type of person.  


After it ended, I've been happy since, not only have I actually talked to someone and it went well. But because we have quite a bit in common from what it seems. For the last 24 hours, I've been really wanting and thinking of ways to build this relationship and possibly be friends. But I'm not sure how, since I don't want to come across as desperate, annoying, or clingy.   
To be honest, I don't know why he asked to hang out, and very suddenly at that. It's not lost on me that he asked during the week of Valentine's Day. I'm not sure if he has a crush on me or just genuinely wants to maybe be friends with me, I can't really tell. I came to the conclusion that he's just curious about me, and maybe at the very least, wants to be friends with me. Since this was the first time we truly talked to one another before. I don't want to or think it's right to assume how he feels about me because I have no clue.

Anyway, my main question is what should I try and do to build that relationship? I'm thinking of possibly waiting until next weekend when we'll meet again at our club, and maybe ask him if he wants to hang out again during the week. I've thought of a couple of options like eating lunch or dinner on campus and studying/ doing homework together. It's very cold where I am, so my options are quite low.

this is very rambly as I want to get this thought out of my head but I really want to try, especially after talking with my counselor numerous times about my social anxiety and feelings of loneliness in general.

TLDR: I (18F) want to build a friendship with a guy (18-19M) from my club. Especially now after he asked to hang out suddenly, and ended up having a very pleasant time getting to know each other, and going well overall. I want to try to hang out with him more and get to know him more, to build a possible friendship.",1,1739580380.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

For one moment you are happy and in another, desperate. Emma feels scared when she is in a good mood, she feels like something bad is going to happen soon.

She was turning left and right while sleeping, something was tormenting her. Finding herself at the beach having fun with her family. Her son Noah was smiling and laughing chasing the waves. All of a sudden, the ocean was going backward. Freaking out from what was going to happen, with her mouth wide open she screamed from the deepest of her lungs: ""Noah, run as fast as you can towards the hills! Run, Noah Run!"" The ocean turned into a gigantic tsunami ready to wipe out everything in his way. Noah for a moment was there, and then she lost him from her sight. Evan was there too, but where was he?

Those violent and furious waves took away umbrellas, a bit further, a car, and then flooded a building nearby. The waves' noise was so loud that she had to cover her ears to survive being deaf. The feeling that she couldn't do anything to stop this left her numb and paralyzed for a second. Then she started to run again, turned her head back to sick for Noah...The waves were still behind her, so close and ready to catch her...

Then she felt a warm kiss on her chick, trying to open her heavy eyes she saw Evan. Was that a dream? Thank Goodness it was. When she saw his smile, her heart felt relieved. Trying to move the blankets, she stood up at her bed for some moments and then went towards the bathroom. When she was out her husband had already prepared the expresso coffee. She liked it with no sugar cream and that was just perfect. They usually loved to talk for an hour on that coffee and discuss different things on their way.

That day was just any other day, making ready her son for school. Snacks check, water bottle check, and backpack check. Everything was ready for school. After that, Emma would start cleaning, cooking, and studying at the same time. She was not an obsessed cleaning type. A house is not a hotel she said, so it should not be always in order and shiny.

Checking the time on her phone, saw that was almost time to pick up Noah. Getting ready to go out, she had a sudden call from her husband:

""Hunny, can you please pick me up from my mom's house? I need to change the cars.""

At first, she agreed but walking outside in the parking area, saw that everything was surrounded by ice. Even though stepping one step at a time she almost slipped. Her car was covered everywhere with ice, above and underneath. In this situation, she could not dare to pull it out, not alone. So, she had to ask Evan for help.

And there he was, pulling the car out without any problem. He loved to brag about his driving skills and repeated that to everyone 'I am not a cartoon driver'. When she was good to go, saw that there was no more time left to give him a ride. With a sad face and feeling sorry she turned around and said:

“I’m sorry, but you should have told me earlier about this; now it’s too late to pick up Noah. I have to go,” she spoke in a hurry. Then she jumped towards the car to sit in the driver’s seat. It was a bit high for her; she always had to jump to reach it. That jump made her always laugh at herself.

Evan, on the other hand, was getting ready for work. He shaved and dressed. For him, appearance was a big deal, and took that very seriously. He wore skinny blue dark jeans, a shirt, and some not-too-sporty sneakers. Of course, he could not forget to take also a shower before going to work. Emma always thought that he took so much care of himself just to be at the center of attention.

Driving carefully, suddenly, she heard strange sounds on her phone. Realizing then that she might have forgotten to close the call with her husband. Despite that, she decided to listen more. Having a feeling, that something was going to happen. At the same time, paying attention to the long line of parent pick-up. As they were ten more minutes before the dismissal, she put the car in the parking march and waited.

In the waiting silence, Emma heard on that call a screaming corny voice, definitely a woman's voice. It did not stop; it was loudly and repeatedly. Her breathing paused for a second, trying to understand what was happening. A lot of questions attacked her at the same time; 'Was he cheating or what? What was he doing? With whom was he?' Oh, no!

Trying to wake herself up, thinking it was a nightmare, she shook her head. Of course, she was going crazy, her mind was playing tricks on her. Breathing too fast, her hands were shaking, and her stomach was like someone had just punched her right through it.

Not sure what to do she rolled her eyes from left to right, having a messed-up feeling. Biting nervously her lips, she hung up and called back. Well, she needed an explanation a reason or something. But Evan was taking a long time to pick up the phone and answer. 'Of course, he had so much better to do.' thinking ironically. Losing control of her emotions, Emma wished to never have witnessed that, but yet she did.

“Why were you not answering? With whom are you right now? What the heck are you doing? Answer me!” screaming all of these interrogative questions in one single breath.

“I am at home exactly where you left me!"" he spoke like nothing had happened as if everything was just normal.

“Do you think I am stupid or what? Stop pretending you piece of sh...! I heard you on the phone. Who is there with you? I heard that b... screaming. I hate you; I hate you. Do not talk to me ever again. I am so sick and tired of this.

And his answer was as simple as that; 'It was just a movie playing on the TV.'

Oh, she was mad, so mad that she had to hang up the phone. Followed, by a short and angry message sent to him, 'I do not want to see or hear anything from you!'

Looking out the window, with one hand on her chest and the other one on the wheel. A panic attack took her over and couldn’t catch her breath. With her hands shivering, opened the left window of the driver’s side to get some fresh air; It was getting too hot in there. Putting her head outside of the window for some seconds helped her a little bit.

She wanted so much to scream and let all her pain out but, there were a lot of cars close to her. Emma knew that in a few minutes, she was going to be with her son. He was so young and innocent, she was the luckiest mom in the world having such a beautiful gift in her life. Thinking about that was ready to fake a smile. However, every time she smiled, felt like losing some pieces of her. She had to be strong, for him. 'Calm yourself, Emma! Come on! You can do it. A few more minutes than you can let the scream out.' she encouraged herself.

Emma saw that Noah was coming slowly, towards the car. Taking one step at a time as the sidewalk was icy. That day he was wearing a black Adidas tracksuit and a warm coat. Carefully opened the car's back door and hopped inside.

“Good afternoon sweety! Buckle up, please. How was school today?” Trying to start a conversation with him.

At that time, Evan called a hundred times and sent a lot of messages on the phone. Not surprisingly, none of them was read or answered by Emma. Seeing herself in that kind of situation more than once, felt so exhausted.

As soon as they were home, she set the table and went to lock herself in the bathroom. Leaned against the wall, placed her hands on her head then sat down on the cold tiles. Letting out a silent scream; as she could not make herself heard, her soul was crying on the inside. Strangely, though no tears came out; no, for a reason she couldn’t cry.

1ippkg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1ippkg1/well_i_did_it_it_being_everything_wrong/,Well I did it (it being everything wrong),"Played a solo session today w a player in my campign who hadn’t been able to make it to the last couple sessions. We were both tired, I didn’t prepare well, I had a specific vision of how I wanted it to go / end up, and we were trying to play in a coffee shop, sharing a table with people who were working. 

As you can imagine, nothing here was set up to succeed. 

I railroaded, presented unwinable fights to a martial, and gave essentially no benefit for doing this whole thing. (I wanted to give info on the main quest, but had a really specific circumstanfe in mind to do that and we stopped before we got there)

Session ended when enemies interrupted a rest and player said ‘I’m not liking this session.’ We stopped, talked about how it had gone, and how we could move into the session we’re playing with the full group tomorrow. 

(The rest of the party is in the middle of a fight that was going exactly as I hoped when we left off—monsters being monstrous, surprises being surprising, and players using their resources excellently—and I was excited to come back to it. Bc we’re having the absent player rejoin, I wanted a way to have them already be there without retconning what the rest of the party did)

I want to have a better resolution with this player, and feel it’s on me since I made a whole slew of mistakes. 

What I’m thinking of is offering a few options:
- we retcon from before the solo session and narrate how the character ends up in the fight
- we retcon from a specific point in the solo session, with some in-game (positive for the player) ramifications from the unwinnable combat I set up, and then narrate how they end up in the fight, with options to either be captured by bad guys and forcibly detained where the fight is happening, coming to consciousnesses as we start the session, or to come in independently (they’ll have to figure out how that happens and tell me)
- we leave things as they are, which means they wake up in a crate in the room the fight’s happening in

Whaddya think? Good options? Have a better idea? Should I quit DMing bc I messed up? (Kidding about that last one)

1ippgqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1ippgqp/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table.

Me and my boyfriend had coffee together with some V day fun. After he left my stomach felt off, but I figured it was just my stomach settling from the excitement of being with him. 

Driving to work my stomach gets progressively more unsettled. It feels like my gut is bubbling and moving fast. I get to the office before any of my coworkers and start to settle into my desk. I start typing my first email and I pass a little gas. But one felt warmer than the others. And i instantly get scared that it might've been more than gas. As soon as i start to stand up, my coworker walks in and says ""Wow smells like a barnes and nobles in here!"" 

I'm both mortified but also dying laughing on the inside. I say ""Really!?! Smells like books or something?""

And he says ""Yeah books and coffee its a great smell""

I laugh a little and say ""Those are great smells!""

I make my way to the bathroom and confirm my horror that i did in fact pass more than just gas. I find an excuse to leave the office and run to the nearest target to get new underwear. But all day, all i can think about is how my co worker thought my chocolate surprise smelled like barnes and nobles bookstore.

TL:DR
Dont have coffee and s*x on an empty stomach. Dont trust any extra warm gas. Always have spare underwear in your car!!",15,1739579715.0,tifu,3,0.94,False

I know where they work. They have everything public and I have also confirmed it. I am so upset that I left myself get scammed for the first time ever.

Between date 1 and 2 there were three weeks with no contact because he was traveling and we hadn’t exchanged number yet. He kissed me after the 3rd “date” but it caught me off guard and I haven’t really initiated anything since.

The whole month of January, he was “out of town” and we didn’t contact each other that entire time either, which I just accepted as closing the chapter of our brief connection. He reached back out late January and it made sense as to why he was out of town, but I’m past the point of feeling emotional or physical attraction for him. 

I do find him intriguing and want to spend time getting to know him more platonically, without the expectation that we’ll grow into something more. I let him know I would like to stop going over to his place (which we’ve been doing since date 3) as it seems to be giving him the idea that more is going to happen, and I don’t want to lead him on.

Will it most likely fizzle out now that I took something physical/sexual off the table for the time being? What’s a 45 year old doing hanging with someone my age? Am I oblivious to something?

In Miasma Tower, there’s a carton of eggs in the break room, so sure, it could be as simple as “same reason there’s coffee everywhere, they eat eggs for breakfast every morning,” but even the coffee obsession wasn’t until a few games in, whereas the eggs were there in game 1.

They tend to be portrayed as having absolutely anything in them, usually (but not always) regardless of appearance; not a terribly uncommon thing in games, though most examples that come to mind (Pokémon, Yoshi’s Island, Billy Hatcher) are from at least the next decade over. And, yeah, near the end of Miasma Tower, grasshoppers start to hatch from the carton of eggs, which, grasshoppers do hatch from eggs but not chicken eggs. Still, that differentiates it from the coffee a little, being part of the absurd, creepy imagery in Miasma Tower rather than just mentioned as something the developers are too reliant on.

I’ve always had a complicated relationship with love. I’m a hopeless romantic at heart. Always have been, hope I always will be. Maybe it’s all the fantasy books I read growing up to escape my toxic environment; the music I listened to that made my heart swell and my imagination wander. I’ve always viewed love in a very poetic or idyllic way. All sleepy morning kisses, shared laughs over coffee, shared poetry, stargazing, late night phone calls where you just don’t want to hang up because you just wanna hear their voice a bit more. Cringy love posts on social media, dedication posts on birthdays and special holidays. The type of intimacy that feels both gentle and sweet, yet also a bit naughty, a soft caress here, a butt slap there. When you’re in bed together, you’re a tangle of arms and legs trying to be as close to the other as possible. I tend to fall hard, and fast. I love hard, and deeply. I don’t know how to balance that part of myself without putting myself in the line of fire to get hurt. I don’t know how to manage being myself, loving the way I truly would with also protecting myself and my boundaries. I want to believe that that “fairytale” of love exists despite all the trauma and pain we all carry. I’ve always desired that intense and deep love. The desire to know someone and let yourself be known wholly. That despite the ugliness and the horrors of the world, we can still open our hearts to each other. Despite past hurts, we can trust again. Ah, I guess I’m just sharing my musings because I’m thinking about love, the ones I love, about being loved myself. I know that ultimately like thanksgiving that a large part of Valentine’s Day is capitalistic but I like to think of the heart of the idea behind it, outside of the gifts. It’s about connection.

I hope you all feel loved in some way today. If not from anyone else, I’m sending it out to you 🤍",1,1739579327.0,love,1,1.0,False

1ipp9av,https://i.redd.it/qbl2mm4s57je1.jpeg,Drake the type: The Terrible Talent Show! Part 1 (Story),"(Apologies for typos/formatting errors. This was done on mobile. Please enjoy!)


The scene opens with our hero, Aubrey, turning off his alarm clock and jumping out of bed, a big smile across his face. He throws some clothes on and tells his pet gold fish, Franklin, that ""today is the big day!"". He runs over to his calendar and looks at the current date, which has a big red circle and says ""talent show"". He runs down stairs to the dining room. His mom is putting the last plate of food on the table. A delicious assortment of food is neatly spread across the table. Eggs, grits, pancakes, waffles, sausage and just about every type of breakfast food can be seen. Aubreys father is seen reading the newspaper and holding a cup of black coffee. Aubrey runs past the table, only grabbing a single piece of toast before running to the door. ""Well you're in a hurry, huh?"" Aubrey's mom says with a grin. ""I'm meeting up with Dexter and Larry before school to go over our routine one last time!"" Aubrey says without stopping. ""See you guys tonight!"". Aubrey jumps on his bike and speeds to school. His neighbors are seen watering their lawns and tending to their gardens. 

Aubrey makes it to school and parks his bike. He sees Dexter's and Larry's bikes already there and heads off to meet them at the auditorium. Aubrey could barely contain his excitement. You see, this isn't just another talent show....Aubrey's crush is going to be in the audience and he has to impress her. That way, she can't say no when he asks her to go to the school dance with him! Aubrey walks in the auditorium and sees Dexter and Larry. ""Hey guys!"" Aubrey says, jogging to his friends. ""Hey Aubrey!"" His friends say in unison. ""You guys ready to run through the routine one more time?"" Aubrey says. ""Indubitably"" Says Dexter. ""Yeah, sure"" Larry says as he finishes the last bite of his chocolate bar. ""Ok, Dexter, get the smoke machine ready. Larry, get ready to crank up the music! When Sally sees my dance, she'll have to go to the school dance with me!"" Aubrey says, his excitement shining through. 

""What dance?"" A voice says from behind the friends. The 3 boys instantly freeze in fear. That voice....they know it all too well....its....its....KENDRICK!!! Kendrick, fitted with his letterman jacket, and his two goons, Dirk and Chungly, walk over to the boys. ""You made up a dance to impress Sally?"" Kendrick says, slightly laughing. ""Too bad Sally only dates cool guys like me!"" Kendrick and his goons laugh. ""According to my calculations, Sally would never date a bully like you!"" Dexter says, standing up for Aubrey. ""Chungly, take care of that nerd."" Kendrick says. Chungly waddles over to Dexter, picks him up and puts him head first into a trash can. ""Thor's beard! Get me out of this nasty trash receptacle!"" Dexter yells, his voice muffled. ""Leave us alone, Kendrick!"" Aubrey says, feigning courage. ""LeAvE uS aLoNe KeNdRiCk!"" Dirk says, mocking our hero. The 3 goons laugh. ""Thats not very nice!"" Larry says, immediately regretting speaking up. ""Oh really? You know what else isn't nice?"" Kendrick asks. ""Getting shoved inside a locker! Get em Dirk!"" Larry screams as he runs away, Dirk giving chase. ""Come here, fat boy!"" Dirk yells as him and Larry disappear around the corner. ""Dont worry Aubrey, you're safe for now. I've got something special for you later."" Kendrick says with an ominous grin. ""Come on Chungly, I found my dad's lighter. Let's go have some fun!"" Kendrick says as he heads towards the door. ""Can we get some pancakes first? I'm starving!"" Chungly says, following Kendrick. ""Didn't you just eat?"" Kendrick asks, his voice fading as he walks off. 

Aubrey, feeling a slight sense of relief, runs over to pull Dexter out of the trash can. ""Those rapscallions!"" Dexter says, cleaning a banana peel off of his head. ""By George, I will have my revenge on those fools!"" ""How?! Kendrick and his stupid friends will kick our butts!"" Aubrey says, defeated. I'll....I'll....I don't know...."" Dexter says, his eyes falling to the floor. The boys stand in silence, knowing theres nothing they can do. 

*ringggggg*

The bell signifying class is about to begin breaks the boys our of their silence. ""Oh crud, we're gonna be late for class!"" Says Aubrey. The two boys take off, heading to their lockers. Aubrey thinks about what Kendrick said. ""Something special for me later? What does that mean??"" Aubrey thinks to himself. Anxiety starts to set in as Aubrey wonders what Kendrick and his goons have planned. His thoughts are interrupted as they reach their lockers. 

Dexter opens his locker door and Larry plops out. ""Hey guys"" Larry says. ""You ok, Larry?"" Aubrey asks his portly friend. ""Yeah, I'm ok."" Says Larry defeated, still laying on the floor. Aubrey and Dexter help Larry to his feet. Dexter digs through his locker looking for his math book and finds an empty sandwich wrapper. ""My tuna fish sandwich!"" Dexter crys. ""Sorry Dexter....I got a little hungry while I was in there."" The 2 friends begin to argue. Aubrey, however, sees his crush, Sally, from down the hall. Romantic music can be heard and Sally seems to be moving in slow motion. ""Earth to Aubrey!"" Larry says, breaking Aubrey out of his trance. ""Were gonna be late for class, lets go!""

The boys make it to math class right on time and take their seats. Aubrey was deep in thought, paying no attention to the teacher. What was Kendrick going to do? What would Sally think of his dance? So many questions ran through Aubrey's mind. Before he knew it, his last class was ending. ""Students, please report to the auditorium for the 5th annual Bumblefuck Middle School talent show!"" a voice says over the intercom. 

""Ah geez, its time for the talent show!"" Aubrey thinks to himself, nerves setting in. ""Come on Aubrey, you'll be fine!"" Larry says in a reassuring tone. Everyone starts heading to the auditorium and the contestants head backstage. Aubrey sees the other contestants warming up. Singing, gymnastics, a ventriloquist and so on. A list showing in what order the contestants go on stage is hung up. Aubrey is going second, right after someone by the name of K-Rick. K-Rick? Aubrey had never heard that name before, but he didnt think much of it. ""Welcome to the talent show everyone! Please welcome our first act, K-Rick!"" The announcer says. A guy dressed in a cool track suit with a hat pulled down, covering his eyes walks by Aubrey and heads to the stage. ""He looked....familiar"" Aubrey thinks to himself. Aubrey peeks through the curtains to watch the first act. The lights are dim, but suddenly flash on, revealing none other than Kendrick! Kendrick turns his head to Aubrey and gives him a sly wink. ""Kendrick?! What is he doing?!"" Aubrey asks himself. ""This goes out to my man Aubrey Graham!"" Kendrick says. A hip hop beat starts playing and Kendrick pumps the crowd up. Aubrey is in complete shock at what he is seeing. 

""Yo Aubrey you so lame you ain't got game! You play fortnite with no battle pass? What up with that? Aubrey Aubrey you're a nerd, and you smell like a turd!"" 

The crowd, including the teachers and parents, are clapping along with the beat and cheering wildly for Kendrick. Aubrey is in disbelief, unable to even move. After what seems like forever, Kendrick finishes up his diss track with one final brutal line. ""You think Sally will think you're cool? The only thing she'll think is that you're a fool!"" Kendrick drops the mic, throws up two peace signs and walks backstage. The crowd is on their feet, their cheers deafening. Kendrick walks by Aubrey, who is still frozen. ""Good luck with your dance"" he says while snickering.

What will our hero do? Can he find the courage to perform his dance? Will Kendrick win again?? Tune in for part 2!",3,1739579096.0,DrakeTheType,0,1.0,False

1ipp5uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1ipp5uw/training_for_mission/,Training for MISSion,"""Good morning, gents.  Welcome to the first day of indoctrination for the first MISS team; that's you.  You've all passed selection, but you won't get to pin on your MISS badges until you've passed through training.  MISS stands for Mechanised Infantry Surveillance and Sniping, and you'll soon see why.  Sergeant, get that cart over here and let's take a look at the gear.  I'll show you at the front of the class first; later you'll get your fingerprints all over it.

""Great.  Let's start with that box on top.  This, gentlemen, is a computer.  I know that it doesn't look like one.  There's no screen, there's no keyboard, it's just a box with dust-proof connections, but it's a computer.  It weighs just under three pounds in its current configuration, and it is the brain of your setup.  Everything else gets plugged into it.  You'll actually have two for redundancy, but you'll only need one at a time.

""The first thing that you will all plug into it is either a power lead from a generator, or a battery pack.  The generator depends on where you are, so we don't have one here, but this is the battery pack that you will have in the field.  It's silent, it's about thirty pounds, and it's based on Lithium battery technology.  It comes with a solar panel to help top it up, or recharge it when not in use, but it should last for seventy-two hours of use in the field.  If you can rig its solar panel, you should get a week out of it even with cloudy days; more if the sun is good.  Don't plug your coffee pot into it; it's bad for the battery charge level and your disciplinary record.  If you have the battery pack and a generator output, plug the generator into the battery pack, then the other equipment into the battery pack.  The battery pack will clean and level power delivery into all the other equipment, while also trickle-charging itself so that you'll be good to go even if the generator runs out of fuel.

""Next, you will all need your HUD goggles.  These will act as the monitor for your computer.  There are enough connections on the computer for four sets of goggles, but you'll typically use two at a time because you will operate in teams of two, up to as many as eight.  You will also get your interface tools.  Yes, they look like Playstation controllers that take protein powder and steroids, but they have been carefully optimised for this mission.  The goggles and controller with their cables weigh under five pounds altogether.

""Sergeant, can you please lift that onto the desk so that everybody can see?  Thanks.  I know what it looks like, and I know that half of you want to get hand lotion all over it right now, but if you can stop giggling like a bunch of schoolgirls long enough to listen, you'll see that this part is a shrouded barrel with integrated signature suppression near the front of the barrel, and with a base.  The base contains machinery to aim and reload the weapon as well as to gather rangefinding and windage information which it then feeds back to the central computer.  This means that you can use the computer to designate a target, order a lock on, and then fire at the time that you find convenient.  In fact, if your array contains six such rifles, you can get each of them to lock on and automatically fire once all six are locked on and verified.  Because there is no human finger engaging a trigger, you don't have to worry about heartbeat, flinch or breathing and you don't have a stock.  This is an entirely remotely operated precision weapon capable of hitting a human torso in real world conditions ten times out of ten at the range of a mile, and nine out of ten at two.  There are other versions used for anti-drone warfare that fire buckshot rounds, and their range is shorter but their accuracy is excellent.  They are your semi-automated defense tools.  There is a direct operation option in case your computer has failed, using a set of goggles and controller, but that is a fallback and I do not recommend using it as standard procedure.  This package varies in weight depending on configuration, but this sniping option is twenty-five pounds.

""This is the big brother for long-range delivery of calibrated pain; it's a remote-controlled 60mm mortar, capable of sub-meter accuracy indirect fire out to two klicks, or slightly less accurate to three.  This means that you could dump a 60mm HE round into the bed of a pickup truck, two miles out.  This is heavy; it's 100 pounds without ammunition, but when you want to disrupt a chopper landing across a ridge, it's the right tool for the job.  There is a similar 80mm version just coming out of development right now and I don't have an example here today, but that delivers twice the pain at twice the range, and just like their rifle cousins they can hold fire for coordinated delivery.  Want to clear out a set of trenches or behind a wall in one grand slam?  Tell four of these puppies to lock on, then punch the button when the moment is right.  They can also set rounds for airburst, and automatically select from up to four ammunition bins.  Yes, question up front?""

""Chief, this is hundreds of pounds, we're not humping this all in the field, right?""

""I can tell that your recruiter cut you a waiver on your ASVAB.  No, Einstein, you will not be humping these chunks out into the field.  That's the 'Mechanised' part.  However, in the field you will get to arrange the individual pieces for appropriate deployment based on the tactical situation.  Or, in your case, you will do the humping while your buddy tells you where to put them.  There's also an option for parachute delivery in a pallet format, for less accessible situations.  Now, if I may continue ... the computer can also host a wireless system for controlling a number of drones.  These drones serve a number of roles.  Here we have a surveillance drone.  It is optimised for low energy consumption soaring flight, giving it a loiter time of over 24 hours.  Think of it as your AWACS.  It can give you accurate, real-time visual, infrared and electromagnetic data over a ten klick radius.  Yes, that means it can see things further away than your baby artillery can hit them.  It has three sensor types: panoramic, localised and hawkeye.  The panoramic sensor looks at the overall situation, relative positions, and it does motion detection to identify points for additional investigation.  The localised sensors will get high resolution data on specific parts of your operational space.  You can control them manually, or they will autonomously capture potential points of interest.  The hawkeye is your zoomed in soda-straw vision of something, which you can use for inspecting details.  The computer tracks objects, terrain and motion autonomously, but you can designate particular items as friendlies, hostiles, noncombatants and so on.  The computer generates a live updating map of the terrain, visibility and weather conditions and target movements based on what the surveillance drone tells it.  When you're not running its decisions, the computer and surveillance drone will collaborate to constantly update views, making sure that no data gets too stale.

""This is your interceptor drone.  Quick-launching from a catapult, it autonomously attacks designated targets with its integrated weaponry.  By default, it's loaded with buckshot which works just great on flying drones, but it can also deploy a tangleshell which is like a small, weighted net which wraps the target up tight.  It's very effective, it's radio passive, it flies at speeds up to two hundred knots and returns to a landing net system, from which you will have to replenish and reload it.  This is your area denial system for competing drones, and depending on your facilities you can dispatch up to ten of them at once.

""Last but not least, you get outbound comms.  This is encrypted, directional beam to avoid interception as much as possible.  However, this lets you call in the cavalry when something shows up bigger than you can chew.  Your virtual map is detailed and precise enough that you can do everything from designating an enemy tank for airstrike to calling in artillery.  Yes, question?""

""Chief, what about enemy aircraft?""

""Anything drone size, you should have the tools to handle.  Anything bigger, your surveillance drones should pick up if its signature is visible at all, whether infrared, radio or visual.  You can then pass word up the chain, but nothing in this system gives you SAM capabilities.  This is permissive environment equipment, unless you're parked next to a SAM site.  Yes, another question?""

""Chief, I know that the battery pack powers the computer, but does it also power everything else?""

""Good question.  Munitions are what they are, but everything is electric up to the flying drones.  They run on the exact same diesel as your Humvee.  In fact, not that I'm suggesting this, but you could siphon diesel from earthmoving machinery to run them if you had to.  If you're running on a generator in the field, they'll drink from the same jerrycan.  Yes?""

""About the interceptors, Chief.  Can they change targets in mid-flight, or are they fire-and-forget?""

""They are, in their present design, fire-and-forget.  They can have multiple designated targets in their plan, and they will execute those targets and then return but that target list can change up to the catapult launch.  They have quick missions; you can expect them to rendezvous with a single designated target at the extreme of your operational zone in under three minutes, attack and return before ten minutes are up.  They can handle three targets per mission, and on paper they have an endurance of twenty minutes but realistically speaking about ten minutes is the sweet spot.  If you have multiple enemy drones entering from different angles, it's better to send up a couple of interceptors with their own kill lists.""

""Why so short, Chief?""

""Weight kills speed.  Diesel is weight.  Their mission is to hit a drone in a ten klick radius hard and fast, then return for a refuel and re-arm.  They don't have landing gear, they don't have pressurised spaces, they just have hard-running engines and a lust for the hydraulic fluid of their enemies.  They go out in a radius of up to ten klicks, give or take, shoot and scoot back home.  It's that simple.  Yes, in the back?""

""What's the altitude envelope of the surveillance drone, Chief?""

""On paper, ten thousand feet.  In practice, its service ceiling is around eighteen thousand feet.  This allows for the characteristics of soaring flight.  It will maintain its own altitude and position without significant input from you.  What you can do is request focus on particular areas, in case you think that you see something important, but nine times out of ten it will do its own thing, autonomously.  This is not an excuse to be lazy - you should review the zone constantly - but it does a good job.  Additionally, this computer can maintain up to three surveillance drones in parallel but that's mostly so that as one needs replenishment, you can send up another and maintain continuity of surveillance.""

""How good is the resolution in practice, Chief?""

""Good.  Very good.  During one exercise we tracked and terminated prairie dogs on the range, daytime and night.  If your enemies are bigger than prairie dogs, you'll see them.""

""Chief, is this just for COIN?""

""It's for wherever you end up.  You can't tackle tanks with it although you can harrass them into buttoning down, you can't outrange artillery and you can't tackle jets with it, but it can  be great for monitoring from near front lines, suppression, and calling in the big boys with precise data.  If you stretch the abilities of the surveillance drones you can get a great view of a twenty klick radius, so it doesn't take many of these packages to get a great 24 hour view of a whole battlefront.  We used a prototype of this setup in urban combat, and the ability to sit in a fortified space while dropping mortars precisely on the heads of people who were surplus to our requirements probably saved a dozen friendly lives.  We could also use the sniping packages for day-night area denial from positions that would otherwise have been very high risk for operators.  All right; enough gabbing.  Let's get this rolled out to the field and start hands-on familiarisation.""",1,1739578801.0,MilitaryStories,1,1.0,False

I've never had a problem with dialing but these are giving me hell.. does anybody out there have these beans and the same machine, Or is there a coffee expert that can tell me the grind size just off the description of the beans?


These beans are very dry compared to other beans i've had.
I've tried all kinds of settings:

-heat up the machine for 10-15 min -Tried the burr at 6 then lowered it to 4 -Tried almost all of the outer grind sizes while the burr is at 4 -I always weight out 18g of beans -I pack evenly with consistent tamping -I run a water cycle before each shot


So far l've either got extremely bitter coffee, with a fast pull (like 16 sec to 36g), or no pull at all, or way too slow.

I need to change.","I recently quit my job, gave my notice and everything due to severe mental health issues. I would wake up feeling dread, I constantly felt anxious and nervous and just overall depressed. I won’t get into too much of the details personally but my workplace wasn’t the best either. Way too much drama, cliques and I always felt left out and unappreciated. I am lucky to live in an apartment building with my fiancé (24M together 6 years) that is owned by his family and our rent is very cheap. I also get food stamps and we’ve cut down on eating out, subscriptions and unnecessary buys. He works a high paying job, so he offered for me to take some time off while he took care of things. This has put me in a “homemaker” role so to speak so i clean the house, take care of pets, cook meals and errands when needed. 

For a little background, i’ve struggled really badly with depression and major anxiety since high school. I’ve always had a hard time making friends and maintaining them. Currently I only have one friend that I occasionally text and meet up with, but that is very rare. I’m on week two of being without a job and staying at home and I already feel like i’m going crazy. I know I should feel relieved and happy to not have to go in to a place that made me depressed. Instead I constantly feel anxious and nervous. I’m scared people will think i’m lazy, that we will run out of money and that all I do is sit at home. I spend time with my fiancé before he leaves for work at 3pm and like I said I am cooking, cleaning and taking care of the pets. Afterwards I will watch some youtube, go on my phone or play a video game. Even though I’m not just sitting on the couch or sleeping all day, I still feel super lazy and unproductive as I tend to finish the tasks early so I have a lot of downtime. 

I find myself just sitting on my phone a lot, I’m struggling to find hobbies and I feel so alone as I don’t have many friends to go out with. Even just once a week, getting out to hang with a friend even if it’s just taking a walk or getting a coffee would feel nice. I feel like i’m not enjoying my time at home cause i’m here so often now. I do want to add that I have been looking and applying to jobs that interest me and I of course would get a job if we started to struggle and needed that extra income. If anyone could give me some tips or advice to feel better about my situation or just how to improve myself that would be awesome.

My parents were always really careful about the Word of Wisdom, like, I wasn’t allowed to go to birthday parties because they were worried there’d be coffee or tea there. That’s not the only reason I didn’t go to parties, but it was definitely a big part of it.

Now that I’m older and around more non-member friends (they are also religious), I’ve started getting curious about what coffee tastes like. I don’t want to drink it or anything, but I can’t help wondering what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I ever cared about it growing up, so I’m kind of confused why it’s coming up now. Is it just a normal thing when you’ve been sheltered from something, or is this just part of growing up?

1ipoxai,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ipoxai/aita_for_wishing_i_never_helped_a_homeless_person/,AITA for wishing I never helped a homeless person?,"This happened in London a few days ago I can't stop thinking about it.
It was around 6pm after I finished work and I just parked my car in Malls parking lot   hoping to go to a supermarket for some light shopping.
When I was about to enter ther store, a homeless guy, Caucasian, I'd say +50yo, looking pretty rough, was sitting in front of the store with a blank look on his face.
It wasn't raining or wet around, but it was pretty cold and I noticed he sitting on some cardboard with not much clothing on... and it broked my heart. 
I apologised for approaching him and asked him if I can buy him anything from the shop.
He seemed to be pleased by the idea and responded something like:
""Oohh, yes, thank you very much young man. (I'm in my 30s lol 😀) There is something I like very much but you might say its a little bit weird...""
Me: ... aaa... like what?
Guy: There's some sunflower seeds that I like from the shop next to this supermarket... pointing with his finger tothe shop that was like 100m away from where we were standing.
Me: ... aaa... you don't want anything from the supermarket? because ... I am going her.  Maybe some warm coffee, tea, a sandwich, I don't know?!...
Guy: pff... shaking his head and slaping his knees... naaah, I didn't want anything, but now you made me crave those sunflower seeds and I wont even have'em, thanks! (shaking his head in dissapprovement)
Me: ...?!?!?! aaa... I'm sorry Mister I didn't mean to bother you, I was just trying to be helpful.
and I entered the supermarket.

Funniest thing happened because inside a met a friend and we ended up buying some stuff together,we had some fast food and we left the mall area, but we left via another exit, not the one I originally entered from. (It's a big place and it felt like a maze lol 😀)

Once we exited we the mall area, my friend asked me to join him to the shop nearby to buy something he forgot.
The thing is, the shop in question was the shop that the homeless person pointed to about his sunflower seeds crave.
I just haven't said anything about my earlier  encounter with that guy to my friend, but now I said to myself that I'll enter the shop with my friend and buy some seeds as well.

After a few minutes I find the seeds and there and then I realised that first of all there's a few varieties of them, salted, unsalted, with spices, baked... more than 10 options.

I just picked one bag salted and one unsalted and I said to myself I will definitely redeem myself.

As I am walking in the direction of my car with my friend, the homeless guy was in the same place.

Me: Excuse me Mister, I brought you some sunflower seeds, I hope I will make your day just a littlr bit better.

Guy: (openes his eyes big and reaches with both of his hands) Lemme see!

Me: I didn't know which one you'd like, so I bought you one salted and one unsalted.

Guy: (Looks at the salty one) This is one is alright. Not my favourite brand... but that will do... 

Me: ... ?!

Guy:  (Looks at the unsalted one) pfff... this is absolute shit! shit! (starts shouting) This is shit! shit! shiit! 
Then he opens the bag, takes one seeds, like he samples it, puts it in his mouth, chews it, then spit it aggressively in disgust:
I said it. it was shit! it is still shit!
Then the poured the seeds in his palm and stars throwing them left and right making sounds line he's feeding the pigeons...???

I just jumped and walked away shocked and angry at the same time. Arguably there was litter in a nice area because of me. And that unsalted bag o seeds was £5.  I could have bought a doughnut for myself instead.

Last relationship lasted a year but flopped, but I have healed from it since. LF ka-date this Valentines' weekend. Taong bahay ako so gusto ko naman lumabas at may gawin this Valentines' and to have a date. We don't have to do anything extravagant or significant, kahit tamang chill lang but make it a little special oks na.

This can sound obnoxious, but take it how you want it: My friends (of < 1 year and of 10+ years) say I'm a good catch, some even say rare catch. Gusto ko lang to ilagay dito to set a standard, but also to give space for me to try and show up *confidently* to a good quality man like you.

**I don't know how to sell myself, so I'll just list things that best describe me:**

* Detail-oriented & analytical, but I'm chill. There are just certain things/topics that get my gears grinding, that I enjoy doing.
* Messy organized-type
* Genuine & prefers genuine connection even with online randos
* Good at effective communication / listening / understanding
* Highly appreciate call outs if worded properly
* Passionate about personal growth & self-work / shadow work. I also have therapy once a month, every month to make sure I'm healing properly.
* Highly self-aware & empathic
* Emotionally intelligent & emotionally mature, but sometimes still immature (i.e., stubbornness, voluntary age regression)
* I have found my life's purpose and am interested in empowering others in their own journeys. This also helps me navigate my own journey. I like learning about new perspectives, not necessarily new things.
* I like engaging in thought-provoking convos. I have 3 card games like this, mga life questions type.
* More comfortable speaking in Taglish. I also type with full words, correct spellings, and check my grammar regularly. Idk, I enjoy doing this.
* Picky eater, grew up with (and still get) princess treatment, but I'm a trauma survivor. You don't have to worry about me being mean and all cos I know what that feels like.
* Agnostic & apolitical. I’m ok talking about faith & spirituality, but not politics.

**Hobbies**:

* Tarot reading (always)
* YouTube/Netflix (most times)
* Gaming (most times), would love to play controller-friendly co-op games with you on PC!
* Reading a book (rare)
* Gouache painting (rare)

**What I'm looking for?**

* Someone who's on about the same maturity level as I am. If you think this is too much, kindly pass me by.
* Aged between 24-29. I prefer younger men or those about my same age, but definitely not older than me. I prefer to have someone I can grow up & grow old with.
* Preferably for long term relationship leading to marriage, but you can chat even if it's just for Valentines' date.
* Someone with class but doesn’t have to wear/have fancy stuff. But preferably has car (for ease of transportation).
* Can hatid/sundo. I'm a new driver and a homebody + don't have own car, so while I do have the license, I don't have the car or the experience to do the same 😅
* Be taller than me, but not too tall. Maybe between 5'7 to 5'11.
* Dog/cat lover, but I'm scared of cats and due to eczema, I can't be around too much fur/dust.
* Someone who does not have an issue with making time for me
* NOT a people pleaser
* Someone who has a slim, almost dad bod body type, but hopefully not a dad bod without any fitness activity
* Someone who is knowledgeable about tech like PC building, game troubleshooting, hardware / software problems, etc.
* Someone who has no vices or addictions, not even vape
* Someone who is open to get tattooed

**More about me that you can hopefully relate with:**

* Single, never been married, no kids
* Not a coffee drinker except social drinking
* No vices or addictions, not even vape, has 4 tattoos
* Text > Calls. But sometimes I like both.
* Can handle multiple topics in the same conversation, but can also hold different conversations across several platforms 😂
* Strong-willed person who dislikes people with weak resolves.
* Introvert & homebody, but that's just me.
* A healed individual with a type C personality.
* Zodiac sign: Sagittarius

**My love languages ranked**: Quality Time > Physical Touch > Words of Affirmation & Acts of Service (on par) > Receiving Gifts

**Anything NSFW is gated beyond 3 in-person dates.**

bf has never been a super romantic guy, but our last two valentine’s days he said “happy valentine’s”, got me my favorite flowers, & we spent time together. i would do something similar, getting him a small gift that i knew he would enjoy. his birthday is four days after valentine’s day, so we typically save the fancy date night for that & just order takeout. this year it’s a little different. for his birthday i planned a surprise three day trip to a small town ski resort. i rented us a cabin, made dinner reservations, & planned tours of nearby wineries/distilleries. i tried to be intentional & pick activities i knew he would genuinely enjoy doing. he knows we’re going somewhere, but doesn’t know any details.

i got off an overnight shift this morning, & stopped by his favorite local coffee shop to pick up a tea strainer set that he had been eyeing, a sampler pack of house-made teas, & his favorite coffee & pastry. i came home, woke him up, & said “happy valentine’s day”. he responded with “oh, yeah. that is today”. he did absolutely love the tea & strainer set. as i’m getting ready for bed, he gets up & starts getting dressed & packing his ski bag. i asked what he was doing, & he said he was going skiing at a local lodge before we both have to go to work tonight. he hadn’t been planning on going skiing, & we had agreed the night before on spending the day in, watching movies, & ordering takeout. he said that he had “forgotten”, & that he had already bought his pass for the day. so he left, & i went to bed. 

he’s currently on his way home, but weather is bad & he won’t get getting back until right before work. i’ve ordered takeout, & i’ll save it to eat until he gets home. i feel awful for being upset because i know he’s tired from working so much & wants to enjoy his free time. but i work just as much as he does & i put so much effort into planning his birthday & a little something for valentine’s day. & he didn’t remember the plans we made twelve hours before. please let me know if i’m overreacting. it feels like i am, because realistically how big of a problem could it be if it can be fixed by a bouquet of flowers?",0,1739577916.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.5,False

I’m positive someone’s done something similar before and I’m also confident someone might find this little tool of mine helpful. When you’re on a mac like me, it’s an added hassle to edit email addresses because the mail client right away transforms them into some sort of entities that you have to double or tripple or right-click and so on. So I created this to make my life easier… 

[https://dtjngl.github.io/duck-mail-concatenator/](https://dtjngl.github.io/duck-mail-concatenator/)

Can we all agree that [DDG's Email Protection portal](https://duckduckgo.com/email/settings/autofill) should natively allow for easy conversion of the recipient’s address i.e. concatenate it with your private duck address? It would be even better if DDG did that since they are the ones providing the private duck address and the recipient’s address could be (optionally) taken from the clipboard.

Until then, feel free to use this tool, on the [github](https://github.com/dtjngl/duck-mail-concatenator/blob/main/README.md) page, in your browser or where ever (it’s all frontend anyway) and if you feel grateful you can buy me a coffee, that will help me get up earlier and do more awesome things!",1,1739577767.0,duckduckgo,1,1.0,False

Our first date was 8 hours (dinner, video games, and a movie) before the two of us got the courage to cuddle and confess. The first night was fucking amazing. We made out and he was all over me, kissing me every chance he got and he was so affectionate and caring. Even woke up later in the night and kissed some more, and in the morning the same thing. He was laying his head in my lap looking up at me with the kindest expression. He made me breakfast and coffee, gave me his shirt…and we spent the next night together too. We only got as far as giving head and it was sort of awkward being our first time together but I didn’t expect anything else and we continued talking daily until I saw him a few days later. I went to his place, he made me tea, and told me he didn’t want a relationship. I told him I understood and we still hung out for 4 hours. 

And all this time he’s still been such a kind friend. Still makes me tea when I go to his place, made me breakfast before we took a roadtrip together…has made distant plans with me, etc. So I thought maybe he wanted to get to know me better as friends or at least that he really valued the time we spent together. But I found out a few days ago that he slept with his ex a couple weeks after me. And now he’s just radio silent. Left me on delivered for two days AFTER what I thought was a really nice hang out. I’ve been crying on and off all week and all fucking day. I don’t know why this is hitting me so hard and I don’t know how to move on. I was just getting to the point that I felt happy to just be friends because I really enjoy his company and believe(d?) he’s a good person. But I feel completely fucking discarded. I just don’t understand how somebody can put so much effort into spending quality time with me to switch up so quickly. I went on a date with someone else who is GORGEOUS to try to get my mind off of it and it went perfectly and made me feel a hundred times worse.

My first diary entry:



Even if I was afraid, it'd do it all over again.



My name is Jaden Hunter 24, and I work as a security guard at Nexus Corporations. It's now been an entire year of me working at Nexus Corporation. there's been a lot of stuff happening, which is why I'm reaching out to this subreddit.  



I started to work at Nexus years ago, of course, I had no idea of the things happening there. I needed the money to survive. Most importantly to help my mother with her medical bills after she beat cancer.



Let me tell you, what Nexus Corporations is hiding from all of you. 



It was the 24th of December 2017 just before Christmas arrived, at this point I was almost 3 hours into my daily night shift. As my eyes drifted over the clock, it read 1:25 AM. 



Even if I was too grown-up for it Christmas was around the corner and I was so happy, who was I kidding christmas was for everyone.



It was late, and I was beginning to feel drowsy. Usually, I’d grab a coffee, but the machine was out of order—again. 



""Not again, this stupid machine is broken""



I slapped the top of the machine lightly, of course, nothing happened. 



Despite my tiredness, I had to stay awake, even if it meant slapping myself awake. 



Usually, there wasn't a lot happening, at least from what I could tell. The security office had a fridge, in which food and drinks were stored and restocked daily for the guards. A red leather couch was set up for us right behind the office chair. A digital clock was sitting on the left side of the Table. So there wasn't a lot in the office itself other than what I just mentioned.  



There were 4 monitors, each showing different parts of the building, with only one being able to switch to different cameras. 



My eyes jolted around the monitors, but there was nothing worth my while. The fixed cameras of which there were 3, concluded the cafeteria, the main hallway, and the courtyard. 



The courtyard creeped me out the most. It was pitch black, making me wonder—was something standing there, watching me?



Because of the terrible weather conditions and thunderstorms, the courtyard would occasionally light up.



My body shifted, as I made my way over to the fridge grabbing an energy drink for myself to drink. I could've sworn out of the corner of my eyes, something was running in the hallways. But I shrugged it off, due to my drowsyness I was sure, it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. 



So I sat back down, not knowing things were about to change for the worse. I grabbed my phone, calling my best friend knowing he'd pick up the phone due to him being a night owl. 



Boredom had to be one of the worst feelings to exist. I was spinning around in small slow circles on my chair, waiting for Aiden to pick the phone up. Finally, he picked it up. 



""What's up Jaden?"" 



Aiden chuckled knowing I was bored as hell.



""Oh you know the usual stuff, just sitting on my chair. checking security cameras and going on occasional security walks. Making sure everything is alright"" 



By the looks of Aidens face, I could tell he was amused by me being bored.



""I'm going for a walk, and you Aiden you're coming with me""



I could tell he was amused by the idea, the way he looked into the camera was intriguing.



""Sure why not buddy, let's go for a walk"" 



he said after howling like a wolf.



I rolled my eyes, grabbing my flashlight and walkie-talkie. 



""Gosh, did you have to do that?"" I scoffed jokingly



""Yes obviously, someone has to talk to the moon awoo""



My hand was resting on the door handle, as I was preparing myself to walk through the creepy halls of this office building.



 I flipped the camera on my phone around, securing it on a holster on my chest. With my flashlight in one hand and my walkie-talkie clipped to my belt, I pushed open the door stepping into the dimly lit hallway.



The silence was suffocating. The usual hum of the building- the air conditioning- and the occasional creaks of old pipes felt absent. As if the entire place was holding its breath. My footsteps echoed, unnervingly loud against the tiled floor. 



Aidens voice crackled through the phone ""Damn, it's quiet as hell in there"" 



I forced a chuckle 



""Tell me about it, walking these halls at night always gives me the chills.""



 The weak glow of my flashlight barely cut through the darkness ahead. Shadows stretched unnaturally around the walls, shifting with each movement of mine. 



Then- 



A noise.



Soft deliberate footsteps.



I froze, my pulse hammering in my ears. The sound came from the hallway ahead, just around the corner. I swallowed hard, my grip tightening around my flashlight. 



I should turn around, and head to the security office.  forget it. 



Instead, I stepped forward.



The moment I did, something in my peripheral vision moved. A blur-to fast to be human. my breath hitched, as my flashlight flickered, plunging the corridors into pure brief darkness. 



By the time the light steadied, the hallway was empty.



I stood there.



My heart is pounding. 



Aidens voice snapped me back to reality



""Yo Jaden you good? you went quiet"" 



I took a shaky breath. ""Yeah... Yeah, I’m fine. Probably just my imagination.""



Probably.



But deep down, I knew better.



I was done, even if Christmas was just around the corner, my joy was replaced by fear and anxiety. So my feet turned me around, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched. 



I broke off into a slight jog, my feet trembling as I made my way back to the office. 



""Sorry, Aiden I gotta go bye""



My hands shaking, as I was trying to hang up the call.



The atmosphere around me shifted. The shadows I once saw, stretching across walls, now made me feel terror. They weren't just a mimic of lights from the plants and vending machines. They felt alive, their shapes contorting.



The walls now felt too close, and my breath growing faster. Is this what insanity feels like? I felt lost, where are the walls always this close?  



No, I'm just tired, that's all right? Tears of sweat, rolled down my forehead as I wiped them away. my hands felt clammy. It's just the darkness, nothing more. But then again, was someone sprinting down the corridors? 



No, it can't be, I figured it was just my imagination from the lack of sleep, I was facing in recent days. 



Then I heard it.



A whisper slithered past my ear.



""What?""



I turned around, my hands subconsciously digging into my scalp, as I was terrified of what the darkness was concealing in its shadows of their abyss. Was my flashlight growing weaker each second? 



""Hide- in - the - janitors - office-""



A cold jolt shot through his veins, his pulse hammering once—then stuttering into silence.



I broke off into a sprint, my feet struggling to find their balance at first. I yanked at the door handle, fingers slipping from the sweat coating my fingers. I opened the door and shut the door behind me. I shoved a chair in front of the door. 



my trembling fingers fumbled with the master's key, slipping twice before I finally clutched it. 



The key clicked into its place, and I twisted it with shaky hands sharp snap-locked. Nothing could get in now.  



I was terrified, my hands shaking uncontrollably.  



I couldn't forget about the volume on the walkie-talkie, so I turned it all the way down. Hiding in the corner, I kept my gaze fixed on the small glass window in the door.



Then I heard it. The basement door—always creaking—opened.



Terrified screams echoed through the hall, followed by deafening gunshots that made my heart drop with each one.



""What the hell are you? Retreat!""



 a soldier shouted, and more gunshots erupted.



 ""Code word: Blackout—repeat, code word: Blackout!""



Suddenly, the air was filled with nothing but the harsh sound of gunfire and a terrifying screech. I could hear soldiers gurgling, suffocating on their own blood. But then, as quickly as it began, the chaos stopped.



It left. Sprinting into the courtyard outside, moving with inhuman speed on all fours.



I could barely make it out—a gray, skeletal figure with long, spindly limbs. It was too fast, too twisted to describe.



But then it left, sprinting off into the courtyard outside with inhumane speed on its fours. I could barely make it out—a gray, skeletal figure with long, spindly limbs. It was too fast, too twisted to describe.



Even if I didn't want to, I had to leave the janitor's office and head to the security room. 



But a document piqued my interest. 



They were documenting a project, they called it project wraith.



Now it all made sense. Here is the document with only two factors written on it due to the breach: 





Project Wraith, Date 7/15/2013



Level 5, Authorized Personal only 



Subject: Operational overview - Phase II - Wraith Entity



Overview: Project Wraith has entered its next critical phase, with a focus on containment and further research referred to as the Wraith entity. This entity presents significant challenges, to standard operation and continues to defy our understanding of both physical and psychological boundaries. the following report outlines the current efforts and measurements. 



Phase 1: Containtment&Classification



task: To continue monitoring and observing the entity's behavior and to adjust containment protocols following recent close calls of breaches. 



Observation: The entity exhibits, extreme strength, agility, and unnatural speed. evading conventional methods, tracking, and immobilization. Continued research is required for better containment tactics. 



2. Behavioral Analysis:



task: to better understand the behavioral and response mechanics.



Observation: The wraith entity seems to show heightened aggression when provoked. But appears to retreat, when the conditions alter in their favor. the entity shows a high level of intelligence. Adapting to new containment measurements with disturbing speed. This warrants further investigation into its cognitive process. 



The Nexus Corporation wasn't just a friendly office building, it was somehow related to an operation about an entity being observed by the military. 



I was barely able to unlock the door. I must get out of here.



I slowly walked on the tiles, of the hallways. making sure, I wasn't tripping over the leg of a deceased cadaver of a soldier. blood and guts were scattered around the floor and walls like a sickening cruel painting project. the odor of death was suffocating me, as I was trying to hold my breath, but eventually, the weakness of my legs would get the better of me. I stumbled, tripping over a leg.  



""fuck"" I whispered



I jumped to the ground, my instincts telling me to play dead.



I could hear its screech—sharp, unnatural, and far too close. My entire body locked up as I struggled to keep from passing out. My breath hitched as its steps drew near—fast yet eerily quiet.



Then, I heard it crawl.



The sound alone was petrifying. It was no longer on the floor; the ceiling was its new hunting ground. I clenched my eyes shut, mouthing a desperate prayer, begging it wouldn’t see me.



Then, a sickening crack.



Its head twisted—a full, unnatural spin.



But it didn’t see me.



Its head quickly spinning around in a full circle. It didn't see me.  



After it was gone, I crawled toward the office, every movement agonizingly slow. I never knew two minutes could feel this long.



I rose to my feet, heart hammering, every nerve in my body screaming at me to stay silent.



Then it happened.



The walkie-talkie crackled to life.



""Anyone there? Hello?""



Panic slammed into me like a freight train.



I threw myself at the door, gripping the handle with trembling fingers. My breath came in short, ragged gasps as I yanked it open and stumbled inside. With shaking hands, I twisted the lock and shoved the couch in front of the door., 



Then I saw it.



Where the couch once sat—there was a gun. Without thinking, I grabbed it, my fingers tightening around the cold metal.



My phone is dead. The walkie-talkie is silent.



Desperation is clinging to me like a moth to a flame.





The creature is screeching and banging on the door.



The food is running out, and the creature won't let loose. I charged my phone and called 911, in the meantime of them telling me they would come to rescue me, I've spent the last of my battery, writing this plead for help on this subreddit. 



December 31st, 2017: 



Am I going so crazy to the point of hearing the voice of my mother?



it felt so soothing to hear her voice, even if it was for the last time.



the door started breaking down, and I ran out of food. I feel so weak. it has been days since I last called, and no one has survived my rescue. I'm beginning to hear a second screeching noise, am I going crazy? or is the wraith entity, not the only one.



\*Even if it didn't win this\*- I cried a tear dropping down on my diary. I still have two options left. 



The entity is still trying to break down the door, it's almost getting in. 



I'm so sorry for what, I'm going to do.



But it has been days and no one survived my rescue.



God bless your souls.



My grip on the gun grows stronger. 



I'm sorry.

I’ve never worked food service before (for a reason lol) and I’m a bit nervous about being out on the spot to make peoples drinks and food in front of them. 

So I’d appreciate any experience and advice to help and also to help calm my nerves about it  as well ",2,1739577038.0,askhotels,2,1.0,False

 Hello, I have been on Zoloft since age 24 (I’m 51 now for reference)at 50mg and eventually got to 100mg. Decided about 6 years ago that I didn’t need it (Which was not the case) and quit. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Anyhoo, got back on and titrated up to 100mg. Felt good until 5 months ago and due to job stress and just life I slowly started spiraling down. 12.5 weeks ago I went up to 150mg and then 200mg for nine days of the 12.5 weeks (200mg made me crazy) so back down to 150mg the last 4 days but still somewhat anxious and kind of blah.

My psychiatrist suggested a direct switch to Lexapro and I’m curious if someone has done something similar. I had OCD, GAD and MDD and just tired of feeling like shit. It’s been 4 days at 150mg and I am just wondering if a direct switch is best. Anyone find relief in doing this? I realize this is on the Zoloft forum but I’m calling out to whoever has input. I am also in therapy and using ART with a therapist, exercising, no caffeine (Unless I want to torture myself, but I just love coffee!) and eat fairly clean. I just want to feel like myself again and getting frustrated. I really want Zoloft to “Kick in” (I realize it doesn’t always happen like that) and wondering if I should stick it out. I know everyone reacts different and was just hoping for some insight. Thanks for reading.",1,1739576992.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False

CHAPTER 7: BLACK FOREST—THE NIGHTLAND EXPEDITION

SCREENPLAY
A Quentin Tarantino-Style Pastiche
Inspired by The Hateful Eight, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs

FADE IN:

EXT. BLACK FOREST – NIGHT

Deep in the woods. The towering pines rise like black cathedral spires, swallowing the moonlight. Mist rolls in low and heavy. Everything is damp, ancient, silent.

The camera pans down.

A fire burns.

Around it, five figures sit.
	•	GRIMES (wrapped in a fur-lined cloak, staring into the flames, her face unreadable.)
	•	BAUDRILLARD (smoking a cigarillo, his eyes reflecting the firelight, knowing something no one else does.)
	•	BEN ZWEIBELSON (methodical, tactical, always watching, sipping black coffee from an old military-issue thermos.)
	•	ORANGE GENGHIS (black Métis girl, leaning back against a tree, flipping a knife between her fingers, expression pure calculation.)
	•	ELON MUSK (standing, pacing, his breath fogging in the cold air, eyes flickering like high-beam headlights in the dark.)

They are at the site of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. The place where the Roman Empire met its greatest humiliation.

Elon stares into the fire.

ELON (muttering to himself, voice tight, clipped, fast, the South African accent stronger in the cold.)
They never saw it coming.

Baudrillard flicks ash into the fire.

BAUDRILLARD (smirking, voice thick with irony)
Neither did the Romans.

Elon snaps his gaze up.

ELON (grinning, teeth flashing white in the dark)
And neither do you.

Beat.

Baudrillard nods, acknowledging the move.

Grimes leans forward, voice soft, dangerous.

GRIMES (tilting her head, curious, seductive, teasing like a predator before the kill.)
Tell me, baby. What’s your play?

Elon stops pacing. Turns. Looks at them.

He gestures to the trees, the darkness beyond.

ELON (voice calm, controlled, the voice of a man who has already won.)
This place. This battle.

He kicks dirt over the fire. The light dies down.

The forest closes in.

ELON (low, deliberate, electric.)
This is where the Empire died.

Orange Genghis lets out a sharp laugh, shaking her head.

ORANGE GENGHIS (casual, almost lazy, but blade-sharp)
You keep talking about empires like they ever lived in the first place.

Elon pauses. Looks at her.

ORANGE GENGHIS (flipping the knife once, catching it by the hilt.)
Rome was a fluke. Every empire’s a fluke. The only thing that lasts is the hold.

Baudrillard smiles.

BAUDRILLARD (murmuring, amused.)
Ah, the hold.

Ben nods, flipping open a map.

BEN (calm, controlled, precise.)
And who holds the hold?

Grimes grins.

GRIMES (mockingly)
The future’s strongest hands.

Orange Genghis leans in. Eyes glowing in the dark.

ORANGE GENGHIS (soft, deliberate, razor-edged.)
Or the ones who know how to play dead.

Beat.

Elon tilts his head. Considering. Then smiles.

ELON (soft, final, satisfied.)
Exactly.

Baudrillard leans back.

BAUDRILLARD (murmuring, always a step ahead.)
Then the only question is…

He looks up. Smiling.

BAUDRILLARD (smirking, teeth glinting in the firelight.)
Who’s Arminius?

Beat.

Silence.

The wind picks up.

EXT. BLACK FOREST – LATER

The group walks single-file through the trees.

Footsteps crunch in the frostbitten leaves.

No one speaks.

The deeper they go, the heavier the air gets.

As if history itself is watching.

Grimes hums to herself.

A song, barely audible.

The melody: “Delete Forever.”

Elon pauses. Looks back at her.

ELON (soft, almost affectionate, teasing.)
That one again?

Grimes smirks, but doesn’t stop humming.

Baudrillard chuckles.

BAUDRILLARD (murmuring, watching Elon.)
She’s setting the tone.

Ben nods.

BEN (low, to Elon.)
You better listen.

Elon keeps walking.

Orange Genghis laughs to herself, shaking her head.

ORANGE GENGHIS (smirking, flipping the knife closed.)
Man’s trying to learn the tune after the music’s already played.

Elon grins, not missing a step.

ELON (easy, confident.)
That’s the thing about echoes, baby.

He gestures up, at the towering trees.

ELON (low, electric, alive.)
They never really stop.

EXT. BLACK FOREST – THE EDGE OF A CLIFF – DAWN

The sun rises over the valley.

A place where empires broke.

A place where maps were rewritten in blood.

Elon stands at the edge. Looking down.

His breath visible in the cold.

Grimes steps beside him.

GRIMES (soft, whispering.)
And?

Elon smiles.

ELON (soft, electric, alive.)
It’s perfect.

Orange Genghis steps up, just behind him.

She tilts her head. Examining the view.

ORANGE GENGHIS (deadpan, smirking.)
You sure about that?

Elon laughs.

ELON (grinning, turning to face her.)
Why?

Orange Genghis gestures to the valley below.

ORANGE GENGHIS (shrugging.)
Just saying.

She meets his gaze.

ORANGE GENGHIS (soft, lethal.)
I don’t think you’re ready for the next part.

Beat.

Elon pauses. Considering. Then—

He grins wider.

ELON (quiet, certain, fearless.)
Then let’s get to it.

FADE TO BLACK.

1ipogqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1ipogqn/45_m4f_kansas_city_looking_for_a_partner_in_the/,45 [M4F] #Kansas City - Looking for a partner in the Midwest.,"Hello!

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",1,1739576726.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1ipoflu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ipoflu/i_am_no_longer_a_people_pleaser_and_all_it_cost/,"I am no longer a people pleaser. And all it cost me was 2 friendships, never going to that Applebee's again and my husbands relationship with his best friend.","Hello Charlotte!! Ive been a fan for a long time and listen to your show religiously!! I have finally decided to tell this story. This is the story of how I began my recovery from being a people pleaser. It only cost me 2 friends, never stepping into an Applebee's ever again and ruined my husbands friendship with his best friend. 

 Apologies, this story will probably be long, it spans from May 2022-December 2023. This is not an AITA. There are parts in this story where I am well aware that I had a part to play, but considering the outrageous BS I was enduring, I've accepted it. 

Some backstory: my husband and I have a group of friends that he has been friends with for about a decade. We're pretty close with them all and hang out weekly. We play Dungeons and Dragons (dnd), video games, board games etc so we see them religiously. I've known my husband since I was 19 but we didn't date til 2020. For this story I will be calling my husband Jack and the 2 ""friends"" will be Adam and Eve. 

My (31F) now Husband(37M) and I got engaged in May of 2022. We didn't plan anything concrete til October of 2022 for the wedding because we had a big vacation that month and wanted to put all of our plans into that before planning our wedding. However between May and October of 2022 We were considering a small elopement wedding. During these months, our friend Adam also got engaged to his now wife eve. We would see adam on a weekly basis but didn't start hanging out with eve until I started running my own dnd campaign 

Adam and Eve were a part of my dnd group that I was running once every 2 weeks. I was unfortunately not very good at it, but I blame that on my commitment issues considering I was working 6 day weeks at my day job and also running my own small business on top of that. This was also when I started getting closer to Eve. She invited me to hang out with her and her best friend, took me to get my nails done before Jack proposed to me and I started to get to know her better. When she got engaged, Adam kept it a surprise for us all and we were really excited for them. Even though I didn't know her well I decided to make her a part of my bridal party (this is also why I don't do literally anything without careful consideration because this was in fact a MASSIVE mistake) 

In the summer of 2022, since we were just planning an elopement, Jack was going to have Adam as his best man and I was going to have my best friend (also my chosen mother) be my maid of honor. Jack wanted to have another friend be a part of the ceremony and I didn't want to invite just one of my friends in my girl friend group and risk offending the other so it made sense to have Eve there, new friendship, Adam was already there, makes sense right?? WRONG!! 

Things really started taking a turn for the worse July 2022. I was running a dnd session and we were all having some adult beverages. That night Eve wore a very small tank top and eventually got cold. She asked for a blanket which I got up to get her. An older friend (let's call him Rich 50ish) made an unnecessary comment about her choice of clothing which I immediately snapped at him for. I didn't think anything more of the situation, it was an unsavory comment  but after I told him Eve could wear whatever she wanted and he didn't have a right to judge her for it, Rich didn't make any other inappropriate comments. Everyone went home, no issues. 

The following Wednesday jack and I went out to with Adam and Eve to a bar for a Drag show. That's when eve told me that rich made her really uncomfortable and she wasn't sure if she wanted to go anymore. Being the people pleaser I am, I told her I would speak to Rich, and knowing Rich, he would apologize for his comment. I did ask her to at least come to one more session so things could be cleared up and hopefully a clean slate could be made. 

Side note here: I'm Autistic and I don't understand sarcasm very well. Like it's embarrassing how it goes right over my head. So when she said Yeah sure..AND NOTHING ELSE, I was like ok cool.
So I spoke to Rich and he was so apologetic for his comment. He lost sleep, barely ate that week (at least thats what he told us) and wanted to apologize, which I told him he would have an opportunity to do at the next session. The day before, eve informed me she would no longer be attending. 

I. Was. Pissed! And wrongfully so in retrospect. But I told her that was unfortunate, and removed her from that group chat with no arguments. In my defense, it made sense to me to remove her if someone in the group was making her uncomfortable. I don't know if she just wanted us to remove Rich from the game, she told us not to do that, that she would remove herself if she continued to feel uncomfortable. She was not willing to accept the apology either which again, is understandable now but I was just frustrated in the moment. I don't like confrontation, was working my ass off and not in my right state of mind. So after she said she wasn't going, I took some space to cool off and was radio silent for the rest of my day.

The next day; Adam comes over for the game. And immediately asks me why I'm mad at eve. I said that I was just frustrated with how things turned out, wish things could have been discussed better and needed some time to sort myself out. At this time it was less than 24 hours so it wasn't like I was giving off some major silent treatment. 

Adam tells me I need to apologize to eve for ""ignoring her"" (she didn't message me at all) and that she can be vindictive if she feels she's been wronged. He recommended I make amends quickly. This pissed me off even more!! I have every right to take space for myself and sort out my emotions. I'm also stubborn like an ox and took this as a challenge. I would not be apologing unless eve came to me to talk about this. 

Another side note: at this point I had gotten to know Eve more and right before this she was going through some family drama that I will not talk about, that's her business. However I got a lot of insight on how Eve treats people considering the way she was treating her mother. In my opinion, I felt that Eve was intentionally making things harder for her mother and manipulating her mother into giving more money and things to appease Eve into having some kind of relationship with her mom. I believe you can learn a lot about someone by how they speaks about others in their lives and listening to eve and her bestie plot the ways eve could convince her mom into giving her more things...let's just say I wasn't amused. Adding the warning Adam gave me about how she can be vindictive...I had a pretty clear picture of how things could be and I decided not to play into that.  I would also like to add that Eve was also not very nice to Jack. It was small and subtle, almost made you wonder if she actually made that comment about his clothes, or snickered at something he said. Very subtle. 



And so the passive back and forth began. We went on our trip in October, had a FANTASTIC time!! And when we got home, I got to work planning our wedding. I am a DIY QUEEN and always on the look out for good deals. In November I found my beautiful, lace ballgown wedding dress online and 60% off!! It was perfect. It was also an online purchase, i could not return it but also was only $100 and I was just planning on eloping. The dress arrived, and it was everything I wanted in a dress. Simple, lace everywhere with a scooped neckline that showed off my shoulders and tattoo, not revealing but flattering and had these gorgeous 3/4 lacey sleeves.  I made a post online saying I said yes to the dress!! And little updates here and there as I made plans. The next time I saw Adam after making that post, he told me that Eve was upset that I didn't invite her to go dress shopping. Apparently we have ""similar"" tastes and she was worried we might get the same dress. I told him I don't understand why she didn't message me herself. He said she was still waiting for my apology for my disrespect from July. At this point it's nearly Christmas. I told Adam no one came with me..because I bought the dress online. And if she wanted to see it she can message me herself.

 Eventually she did start messaging me, one or two messages very rarely. Only about my wedding though. When coming up with a date or colors for the wedding i wanted to make sure they weren't too close, since we both were having weddings in the fall. Her wedding was 2 weeks after mine and thankfully we had different tastes in colors. 

Over Christmas, my husbands parents offered to do the catering for the wedding, they are professional caterers. Jack and I talked about it and he really wanted to have them at his wedding, and it meant a lot that they would do this for him. He doesn't have the best relationship with them and the gesture meant a lot. (This was a whole other bit of MASSIVE drama at our wedding that I would be happy to talk about in a different post) 

She continued to ice me out for months. In January my girl friends and I decided to go on a trip. We got a cabin in the mountains with a hottub. The ladies going were me and the other bride and 2 friends. The other bride was my bridemaid, as well as one of the friends. And the other gal owns a small side hustle bakery and made the cupcakes and macrons for my wedding.  We decided since my friend was getting married in May and I in October that this would sorta be a mutual bridal party/celebration for us all since we were all succeeding in some big ways. I was also planning on doing something closer to my wedding since 3 ladies of my bridal party were not there. It was not really a bridal party in any way but our friend made us bridal bags with very thoughtful gifts. The weekend was wonderful. Absolutely no drama, just 4 girls, enjoying a hottub in the snow, alcohol, good food, movie marathons and board games. It was perfect. 

When I got home I posted the pics from the trip including the pics of the bridal bag goodies. That next evening around 9pm i was in bed about to fall asleep and I received a phone call from Eve. First time I spoke to her verbally in months and she was PISSED that I had my Bachelorette trip and didn't invite her. 1 was stunned. I don't do confrontation well so I sorta stuttered out an explanation. And when I told her it wasn't really that, she said, hmm funny looks a lot like a Bachelorette trip. After telling her I planned on having one in the summer or closer to my wedding day, she said oh ok...sooo what's up? And I was just so mad at this point that I said, what's up is that it's 9pm, i have work tomorrow and I'm going to bed, goodnight. The next day I sent her a more detailed response, explained that my girls trip was with my close group of friends that I've known for about 10 years, that it was a mutual celebration and more for my friend who was getting married in May (they eloped and im so jealous) and since she didn't know anyone there or would probably not want to sleep on the floor, that I didn't think I needed to invite her. I also mentioned that since she's been giving me the cold shoulder I didn't feel comfortable going up to a cabin for 2 nights with her and I'm the only person she knows. 

Surprisingly, she didn't comment on the cold shoulder. Just thanked me for clarifying. It was at this time that I REALLY started to question her roll in my wedding. It was now a full wedding, the guest list had almost 100 people, and she kept asking me what she could do to help with my wedding. And with 9 months to go til the wedding day there wasn't much she could do, and that seemed to really upset her. I was making 100% of all the decisions. As I mentioned before, I have my own small business and I was inspired to hire as many small business owners as I could for my wedding. As you can probably guess, my wedding was not a traditional wedding. But it was MY wedding. One of my bridemaids is a hair stylist, i paid her to do all the bridal hair for the wedding. Her cousin was starting out as a makeup artist, i became her first bride customer. My friend with the bakery, this was her first wedding. I paid them all and tipped. I appreciate the hard work it takes to run a small business and was very proud of them all. My wedding was BEAUTIFUL. 

Around March the anxiety of having Eve in the wedding party was eating away at me. Adam was still giving me snippets of insider news on her thoughts and pressuring me to grovel for her forgiveness. And I genuinely didn't want to be her friend anymore. But In a no hard feelings sort of way. Just didn't see it going anywhere. If I wasn't willing to have my sister be a bridemaid, why was i letting this person be in my wedding party, who talks about me in such a way and expects such big apologies from me when she wouldn't even talk to me about it. I was finding ways to cut her out of things, like the overnight stay at the venue, or not pay for her hair and makeup or her dress. Keep in mind I paid for everything, the overnight stay, hair, make up, my moms dress (i offered to pay for the other bridal dresses and they all declined) And i felt that purposefully excluding Eve would be rude and add unnecessary drama. So I talked to Jack about it, and asked if I could ask her to step down even though Adam was still the best man. He supported me and I wrote her a nice message apologizing, addressed the issue between us and invited her to be a guest instead of a bridesmaid. Initially, the response she gave was very calm. She apologized that I felt that way about our friendship and accepted the demotion. But...several days later..Jack got a call from Adam and demanded i reconsider. I said no. I would reconsider our status in the friendship but I didn't want her in the bridal party. He demanded that we have a very public conversation about it and I said I didn't want to talk as a group about it, but if she wanted to talk to me about what happened, I could meet her for coffee. 
That sorta worked...for a couple weeks. According to Jack, Adam spoke to another member of our friend group and asked advice. At this point, the situation was causing tension between me and Jack and he told me he didn't want me to talk to our mutual friends about it at all. So soon, our friends knew their side of things but no one was talking to me about it. It was not a fun time. Adam called Jack again and told him if we didn't meet in a public location and talk it out, that he would step down as best man and neither of them would come to our wedding. Jack was very upset, he hates ultumatems and will usually choose the opposite of whatever is being demanded purely out of spite. Everyone knows this and Adam didn't care. So..I didn't have a choice. I wasn't going to lose my person over such stupid drama. We met up.

We met and got dinner at a freaking Applebee's. It was loud, chaotic and annoying. We sat down, ordered food and as we planned let them talk first. Right out the gate, Eve was rude and aggressive. She wanted to FIGHT me in the parking lot at one point when I corrected her over something small. I should have just gotten up and left right then but because we had just ordered food I smiled and told her I wasn't an animal and can handle my feelings with words, not fists. I wasn't sure what the point of this meeting was, but according to Adam they wanted to RENEGOCIATE her roll in MY WEDDING. I said well considering your fiance just offered to beat me up in the parking lot, I'm afraid our decision is final.  The whole time she was making passive aggressive comments about me and Jack. And when I told her if we were to have a relationship that there would be boundaries, she exploded and said boundaries were not necessary. She accused me of acting high and mighty, a bitch and other things. Eve accused me of not talking to her either and I explained that since she left my dnd group, Adam had been telling me how she was feeling and I kept inviting her to come to me, but she made no effort on her end. I told her exactly what adam said and how he phrased it. In fact the only apology given was Adam to eve about telling me how she was feeling. But honestly his imput was the reason why I never reached out to her naturally. If he hadn't said anything I would have messaged her in a couple days and probably could have avoided the stand off. But he was also telling her to message me, and she refused to as well.  Towards the end of this most awkward dinner Adam asked me why i havent apologized yet. And when I asked for what exactly, Adam looked at me as if I was a child and said, you don't think you owe her an apology for how you have treated her all these months? And I said no, that i was sorry I invited her to be a bridemaid without really knowing her true colors, sorry for kicking her out of my wedding and I'm sorry that she didn't feel like using her words to communicate with me. Then we paid for our food, got it to go and left them there while she fumed in the corner, angry that she didn't get her way. 

The next time Jack and Adam hung out, they had a very long talk. Jack never told me what adam said about me, but when he came home he told me Adam was not going to our wedding, was no longer best man and he was no longer allowed in our home. Adam did say I was uninvited to their wedding but Jack could still be a groomsman if he wanted. They still have some kind of friendship in group setting only, but they barely see each other now. 

They did not come to our wedding, we had a lovely wedding despite monster in laws, (saving this for another story.) And Jack did not go to their wedding either. Apparently our other friend also refused to go when she got word of this, and also, since she is Trans, was upset because adam and eve got the Mr/Mrs wrong on her and her partners invite. 





Eventually I got to tell my side of things to a few of our friends. We went to another wedding in December. Yes I know, October Novemeber and December weddings in 1 friend group. I didn't speak to Adam or eve after the Applebee's fiasco. But while Adam was saying his goodbyes, he patted my head in a really awkward way. And I'm not saying this lightly, everyone KNOWS i don't allow my head being touched. I was heavily abused growing up, my hair is expensive to maintain, and especially that night because I paid my hair stylist to make it extra pretty for our friends wedding. I immediately grabbed his hand and twisted it, and told him if he ever touched me again I would break it. Please note...open bar, end of the night. It was said very quietly, the bride and grooms never heard about it. But our closest friends saw it and escorted Adam and Eve out of the venue. 
This friend knew we were no longer friends and when he asked for my side, Jack finally gave me permission to explain my side of things. Since all the weddings were done. I told him everything that happened. Showed text receipts. everything. When Adam spoke to this friend months ago he was asking advice on how to convince me to comply with their wishes. It wasn't even, how do we make the ladies get along or anything. Everything they wanted was to make me complacent to Eve's awful treatment of others. He apologized for not asking about it sooner, and in the past year he has also been seeing Adam less and less. Our other friend, our trans friend, sees him never and has gone no contact with both Adam and Eve for this reason and her own reasons, the lack of respect with her gender change being a big one. 

I've seen them around town, or had friendly functions that force us in close proximity. I am cordial, polite, but i do not speak to them directly. They won't make eye contact with me. Once or twice eve made a spectacle out of herself and caused a scene, but i never needed to do anything. Adam would escort her away, or our friends will keep close to me to ensure nothing happens. I have really good friends. 

I learned a lot from all this. And since the details are pretty obvious Eve if you ever see this, go suck an egg. You cannot treat people like pawns in your game. You cannot throw tantrums to get your way. 

Out of everything I am most grateful for the communication skills my husband and I developed through all of this. This was a STRESSFUL situation over many many months and it could have broken us if we let it. I am forever grateful for my husbands respect and his unwavering loyalty through all of this.

Good evening Coffeeswap,

Putting up my espresso setup for sale. I've tried my hardest to enjoy it but ultimately I think I just don't like espresso. 

**Decent DE1 Pro v1.43 (black)** - $3100 local or buyer pays shipping

Upgrades:  PPS group head parts, silicone group head gasket, Acaia lunar drip tray (the brewing with euan one).   
Also includes 0.2 and 0.3mm puck sim baskets, extra spouted portafilter, extra silicone gasket, and decent portafilter stand. 

Machine works great and I've never had a problem with it. Makes me sad to admit but I've gone through pounds and pounds of coffee and yet I've only made a handful of shots that put a smile on my face instead of a pucker. I still have the suitcase which is also included, so we can ship it but local pickup is preferred (33579).

**Niche Zero (black)** - $550 local or buyer pays shipping

No problems here either. I just won't have a need for it since I'm selling the decent. Also includes the sworks flat burr mod (SSP MP version).

We currently live in Northern Virginia, so it is no surprise that we are hoping to find a neighborhood with walkability and a sense of community, not just a miles-long suburb. I have lived in Augusta in the past (though I was much younger then), so I know not to expect anything equivalent to Arlington, but some of the neighborhoods I have researched and really like are:


Riverwood Plantation: The neighborhood off of William Few Pkwy that looks like you could theoretically walk or golf cart (I have heard many neighborhoods do this) to the Publix grocery store or local coffee shop. Also, very highly rated school zone.


Northwood (or any other neighborhood next to Evans Towne Center Park): While maybe not entirely walkable since the only inlet road I see is off of N Belair Rd, which seems to be a busy one, it is very close to lots of cool things like the performing arts center, the large park, and various restaurants and coffee shops. Also more centrally located in town than Riverwood.


Hammonds Ferry: Awesome looking neighborhood (and super expensive) next to SRP Park that has nice houses that remind me of the ones we have here in Virginia. Probably my favorite one, though this one will take a while to save up for and the houses hardly ever seem to come up for sale. It has restaurants and businesses actually in the middle of the neighborhood, with less than a mile to get to Georgia Ave.


These are obviously the best examples I could find in the area, but any degree of walkability or proximity is appreciated. For example, I also looked at some of the houses around the intersection of N Belair and Columbia Rd in Evans (by the Sonic, Walgreens, Wells Fargo, etc.) and they seem to have some amount of walkability. I am not picky and know not to expect DC, so if a neighborhood can “feasibly” walk or golf cart to even a single grocery store (or even convenience store) and restaurant, fire away. I appreciate any and all suggestions. I will likely work on base so some level of drivability to that is appreciated. ",2,1739576211.0,Augusta,10,0.75,False

I messaged my physician's office already but in case I don't hear from them sooner, I wanted to see if anyone here had some quick advice as to whether I should skip my next day's dosage (or focus on resting etc.).

Context:

* I am an ME/CFS patient, and I've been prescribed LDN as treatment for a little less than a year now. (I've had moderate to severe ME/CFS for 6+ years)
* I had worked my way up to 6mg and had been taking that for several months.
* Recently I agreed to experiment with titrating an additional 1mg every two weeks; this week I was on 8mg daily. I was on autopilot when I was taking my pills and I ended up taking 2 of the wrong one; I was supposed to take 2 of the 1mg pills instead. (I guess more accurately I doubled my original dosage and increased by current dosage by 4mg)

Currently I'm just a little shaky and out of focus but part of that is also due to the fact that I'm anxious about what I did and the fact that I had some decaf coffee earlier (which still has some caffeine). I saw in another thread that the effects will wear off by the end of the day, but those were also threads addressing lower doses than what I'm currently taking.",0,1739576192.0,LowDoseNaltrexone,3,0.5,False

A while ago I (24M) was talking to a girl and she offered to give her Instagram. She had days/weeks in gaps of responses, I thought it was strange and I did mind, but also she was also a bit of an afterthought so I didn't mind too much. 

In her behavior you could say it was flirty but also ambiguous. She then asked me for a coffee(and dinner) or study session together, but cancelled and rescheduled 2 times. After the 3rd time, she stopped replying and I heard a she went on a date in the meantime.

I wasn't gonna entertain her anymore after that. She goes to the same uni as me and I see her almost everyday, so I figured I'd just say hi, how are you tops, but leave it at that when I see her. She kept being happy to see me and at first it was easy to move on and keep it short. 


The more I saw her though, the more my self-esteem just kept wondering why she would not get back to her idea of doing something together. I keep thinking that I don't need her validation, but I kept feeling like she needs to text me. Even though I may not even really like her. 


Today it was extra hard. I saw her again in the uni library, I smiled and went back to study. 10 min later she comes up to me and wants to have a conversation. It's very hard for me to send people away, so we had a quite long chat because I'm also just really chatty. I don't want to make things awkward in places where I'm at almost everyday. But I also saw her later in the cafetaria, was bored so I talked to her for a bit. My question is, did I act right? If she would ask to hangout I would say no, but I feel like it's too much effort for me to act cold. And most importantly, how do I stop wanting her validation?

CHAPTER 6: WELCOME TO THE NIGHTLAND – GRIMES, BAUDRILLARD, AND THE COUNTER-COUP OF THE CONCEPTUAL EMPIRE

SCREENPLAY
A Quentin Tarantino-Style Pastiche
Inspired by The Hateful Eight, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs

FADE IN:

Black screen. White text.

“Paranoia is our watchword, and now we are trying to build coordination.” (Æ, Emergency Transmission 042)

“Seduction is not a game of possession, but of disappearance.” (Baudrillard, Fatal Strategies)

“The only way to counter a coup is with a better story.” (Grimes, in a secret voice memo to Æ, intercepted by six intelligence agencies, none of which understood it)

EXT. PARIS – A SECRET CONFERENCE ROOM – NIGHT

A dimly lit room in a baroque palace that does not officially exist.

At the head of the long, black marble table, sits CLAIRE ELISE BOUCHER – AKA GRIMES.

To her right, JEAN BAUDRILLARD.
To her left, BEN ZWEIBELSON.

Across from them, THREE UNKNOWN FIGURES. Their faces blurred by a strange oscillation effect, as if reality itself refuses to process them fully.

On the table, an old VHS tape labeled: “OPERATION CODEBREAK”

Baudrillard leans forward, eyes glinting.

BAUDRILLARD (grinning, voice thick with irony)
So. The Emperor has declared himself.

The Unknown Figures remain silent.

BAUDRILLARD (mocking, sipping his wine)
“We are all Germanics now.” Marvelous.

Grimes leans back, smoking an unfiltered cigarette, her eyes unfocused, staring into something no one else can see.

GRIMES (quiet, smiling slightly)
He’s playing.

UNKNOWN FIGURE #1 (voice distorted, electronic, genderless)
Explain.

Grimes tilts her head.

GRIMES (gesturing vaguely)
It’s not about politics. It’s not about ideology. It’s play.

She exhales smoke in the shape of an infinity symbol.

GRIMES (calm, almost dreamy)
Elon broke the simulation.

Beat.

UNKNOWN FIGURE #2 (leaning forward, dangerous)
And you let him.

Grimes shrugs.

GRIMES (smirking)
I like to see what happens.

Baudrillard laughs.

BAUDRILLARD (raising his glass)
A fine position for a Miss Anthropocene.

UNKNOWN FIGURE #3 (soft, almost a whisper)
And what happens now?

Grimes leans forward, eyes sharp as a blade.

GRIMES (grinning, teeth flashing like a wolf)
Now?

She gestures to Baudrillard.

Baudrillard slides the VHS tape across the table.

GRIMES (whispering, triumphant)
Now we run the counter-coup.

INT. SPACEX COMMAND CENTER – STARBASE, TEXAS – SAME TIME

Elon stands in front of a massive screen, staring at a live map of the world.

Clusters of red dots spread like a virus.

ELON (murmuring to himself, eyes glowing with mania)
They think I don’t know.

A voice behind him.

BEN ZWEIBELSON (calm, composed, sipping coffee like a man with nothing to fear)
Do you?

Elon turns.

ELON (smirking, electric, on fire)
Baudrillard thinks he’s running a game on me.

BEN (chuckling, unimpressed)
Isn’t he?

Elon laughs. A low, dangerous sound.

ELON (dead serious)
Not this time.

INT. LUXURY SAFEHOUSE – SOMEWHERE IN BERLIN – NIGHT

Grimes and Baudrillard sit across from a massive projector screen.

On it: a live stream from SpaceX.

Elon’s face, grinning, too wide.

GRIMES (soft, to herself, almost affectionate)
Oh, baby.

BAUDRILLARD (watching intently, nodding slightly)
He’s learning.

The screen flickers.

Elon leans into the camera.

ELON (smiling, playful, but sharp as a knife)
Hey, Claire. Hey, Jean.

Grimes and Baudrillard exchange a glance.

ELON (laughing softly)
You really thought I wouldn’t see this coming?

Beat.

ELON (grinning, wicked, perfect)
Welcome to the Nightland.

The screen cuts to black.

Grimes leans back, exhaling.

Baudrillard laughs.

And then, they begin plotting.

FADE TO BLACK.

Body language confusion","A guy friend of mine had an argument with me in which we admitted mutual attraction, but I did not believe him. He started going out of his way to open doors for me, start conversations, and buy me things.

I asked him why he was being so nice and he got angry, and accused me of preferring another guy’s attention. I told him I was just confused. He started being overly friendly and going back to the way things were before. I sent him a message telling him that I liked the favors he was doing me and that I thought it was hot.

The next time I saw him, he was angry at me. Barely even spoke, brought me my morning coffee, rolled his eyes and asked me for $3 to pay him back. I figured I misread things and that I should leave him alone.

I saw him again today and though he didn’t say hi, he was checking me out a lot. I was very busy, on the phone and also at work, so I kind of ignored him- but not on purpose! He left shortly after he arrived.

His body language is confusing and I’m confused on how to act.

Edit for context, per multiple comments: 

There have been two other times I told him I’m interested. One time he said no then acted very jealous and flirty. The other time he said yes, stood me up, then told me he had a girlfriend a week later.

2. The representative was helpful and answered my questions. As I had recertified my employment in November of last year, I was unsure if submitting another one now that I've hit 120 was necessary. She advised that I should do so. She also took me off autopay. 
3. A few hours later, FSA sent a mysterious email to check my account. I had to wait until after work (the anxiety, guys...) but was pleasantly surprised: THE ""golden"" letter stating forgiveness! What a Valentine's treat! (If anyone is unsure where to locate the letter, go to ""My activity"" then click ""PSLF correspondence."") 

A timeline for anyone who may be curious:

November 2024 - sent in annual ECF (electronically)

January - opted to stay put in SAVE and hold my breath

February 5 - Green banners on FSA

February 14 -  ""Golden letter"" stating eligibility for full forgiveness (It states ""effective 10/31/24, so that's interesting...)

A basic example: I started practicing because of strong aversion to my job. That aversion has dropped, but the inertia to start the work remains. Impulses (check my phone, get a coffee) often lead vs effort since that’s the habit. It’s like the value of hard work isn’t conditioned and without a doer pushing effort, the pattern continues (also have ADHD and work from home which doesn’t help).

I’ve also noticed that even without strong craving, body states still shape reactions (eg., headaches make thoughts less kind, even without identification). It’s not a mindful reaction, just the body running its script.

CHAPTER 3: IC EVERYTHING – THE CIA WARGAME TO STOP ELON MUSK

SCREENPLAY
A Quentin Tarantino-Style Pastiche
Inspired by The Hateful Eight, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs

FADE IN:

Black screen.

TEXT ON SCREEN:
“The CIA doesn’t care what you believe. They only care what you can make other people believe.”
— Classified NSA Memo, Declassified 2043

TEXT FADES.

INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS – LANGLEY, VIRGINIA – NIGHT

Dimly lit control room. Monitors stacked floor to ceiling. Screens glow with real-time feeds of X posts, satellite imagery, private messages ripped from encrypted apps.

A large screen at the center displays a deepfake of Elon Musk giving a speech. The AI voice is perfect. It speaks in a slow, deliberate cadence:

	“I have seen the truth. We must burn the entire economy to the ground.”

A CIA OPERATIVE leans forward, hands on the desk. She is BLACK WIDOW QUIET. Eyes like knives.

CIA OPERATIVE (to no one in particular, voice ice cold)
He’s two steps ahead. This is not a wargame anymore.

Across the room, a TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER sips burnt black coffee, looking exhausted. He gestures toward the screen.

TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Are we gonna kill him?

The room goes dead silent. The only sound: the hum of the supercomputers digesting every word Musk has ever said.

A beat.

Then—

A door creaks open.

AGENT AMANDA WALLER (yes, that Amanda Waller, full Suicide Squad energy, bad news in human form) strides in.

She tosses a classified dossier onto the table. It slides like a guillotine blade.

WALLER (calm, deadly)
We don’t kill ideas. We kill the people who can’t control them.

A long silence.

Then a new screen blinks to life.

It’s labeled OPERATION CODEBREAK.

EXT. SPACE X – STARBASE, TEXAS – SAME TIME

Musk stands on the launch pad, staring at the rocket. The wind howls like a spirit that wants to warn him.

His phone buzzes. A message from Grimes.

GRIMES (TEXT):
“You are playing with something you do not understand.”

Musk watches the rocket ignite in blue fire.

ELON (WHISPERING TO HIMSELF, SMILING, LIKE A GODDAMN SUPERHERO WHO JUST BROKE HIS OWN ORIGIN STORY)
IC everything.

INT. PENTAGON BRIEFING ROOM – MIDNIGHT

A cluster of Four-Star Generals, National Security Advisors, and BLACK OPS STRATEGISTS sit in total darkness. The only light comes from the holographic projection of Earth spinning slowly in the air.

At the head of the table: BEN ZWEIBELSON.

He clears his throat.

ZWEIBELSON (calm, scholarly, terrifying in how casual he is about this level of reality manipulation)
Gentlemen, let’s be very clear:

This is not about Musk anymore.

A GENERAL shifts uncomfortably in his seat.

GENERAL (skeptical, but afraid to be wrong)
Then what the fuck is it about?

ZWEIBELSON (leaning forward, voice barely above a whisper)
It’s about who controls the story.

Beat.

ZWEIBELSON (standing up, walking toward the hologram of Earth, slow, deliberate)
Because whoever writes the next five years of history…

(he places his hand on the hologram, and the Earth flickers like a video game asset being rewritten in real time)

ZWEIBELSON (smirking, final, lethal)
…controls the next five hundred.

I know the GE profile and its bretheren are kind of looked down upon here, and I get it, but it had been working well for me until a couple weeks ago. But since I came back from a holiday, the machine now will invariably throw out the grounds on the first shot of the day (or more broadly the first shot after powering up from rest mode) after only a few drips of coffee are dispensed. It then flashes the ""add water"" and ""hot water"" buttons, the manual says this is ""airlock"" caused by the water reservoir being wet on the outside. I don't think this is the issue as it happens every time on the first shot after powerup, but almost never on the subsequent shots throughout the day.

This issue happened previously but was fixed by a descale, but the descale process did not help this time. GE support said to run the hot water function for a time before the first shot, which sometimes fixes the issue but sometimes does not. I wondered if anyone else has had this issue and has a more permanent fix? I know this machine is junk but I would rather try to get it working again than throw a few hundred bucks down the drain.

TLDR: Don't think I have narcolepsy, should I cancel appt?

I recently nodded off in the car and rear ended another car (fortunately no one was hurt). My car journey home is about 45 minutes. This caused me to think back on how often I've felt sleepy when driving and realised there's been more than a handful of evenings where I felt tired and was a danger on the road. 

I've made changes to become safer on the road, and this has been effective: drinking 1 cup of coffee beforehand, stopping half way, increasing the amount of sleep

This led me to seek a referral to a sleep specialist and after a thorough case history they decided to refer me for a sleep study incl.  Multiple Sleep Latency Test.

Since hearing that I may have Narcolepsy I've scoured the Internet for symptoms and read people's personal experience and from this I feel its not likely.

My main concern is I understand these tests are hard to come by and don't want to take a spot of someone else more deserving. However, I also wonder am I just making excuses for myself because I'm in denial and I should be tested. 
 
If anyone's gotten this far my mains symptoms are:
- falling asleep at work 2-3 times a month, always during boring admin tasks 
- feeling very tired driving home (coffee has been a game changer and I have had no issues since drinking 1 cup of coffee before my drive)
- history of falling asleep in school and university ( I've always put this down to stress and long hours studying)
- history of falling asleep in moving vehicles (cars, buses, planes)
- no catoplaxy 
- no hallucinations or sleep paralysis

Finally gave up and made a couple cups of Melozio for us. Stumped on why, I read on the Alto box “not compatible with the Vertuo, Vertuo Plus, or the Vertuo Evoluo machines!! Another WTH. My machine is the Vertuo Round Head Chrome. After four years of ownership and a card carrying member in the Nespresso world I thought a Vertuo pod was a Vertuo pod. TIL. One would think the lady at the Nespresso kiosk would have mentioned the tidbit of information that it may not be compatible. She didn’t ask what machine I had but did have my account open on her laptop in front of her that shows my machine. Bummer, $10 wasted on seven pods. Thank you Melozio for saving the evening.

1ipnlum,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ipnlum/i_was_hesitant_about_starting_a_relationship_with/,I was hesitant about starting a relationship with a woman who had such a young child as I've never really been one for kids.,"What could I say though? I feel like I'm genuinely in love here. Her name is Piper and we met online last year. After chatting for a few months we decided we liked each other and took it to the next level.

For the first 6 months of our relationship, she wouldn't allow me to meet her kid. This is understandable as she just wanted to be sure I was truly ""the one"" before bringing me into her child's life. I'd seen pictures of him on her social media pages and he's such a cute little guy!

""What's his name?"" I asked her in one of our first conversations.

""Milton,"" she replied. ""He's named after his great grandfather.""

Finally, the day came when I got to meet him. I arrived at her house around 4:00 pm and made sure to bring a toy with me. After all, the best way into a 3-year-old's heart is bribery. When Milton heard the front door shut he ran out to the front corridor to see who had arrived. He seemed a little shy at first, but when he saw the Lightning McQueen car in the box I was holding he was suddenly smiling. I smiled back at him.

""Hey Milton! I got this for you!"" I said, handing over the toy car. He snatched it out of my hands greedily. Piper looked over at me with a warm smile.

""Milton,"" she said. ""This is Robert. I was hoping that maybe we could all be friends from now on. Is that okay, buddy?""

""Yes!"" Milton said, eagerly handing her the box to open.

I'm not sure why I was so nervous to meet him. He seemed like a well-behaved kid. Besides, Piper was the best thing that ever happened to me and I feel I'd literally go to Hell and back for her.



That night, Piper and I hung out on the couch and watched a Disney movie while Milton hung out on the floor playing with his new toy car. About halfway through the movie Milton started to get tired of playing and came to sit with us on the couch. He sat right between Piper and me with his tiny arm around my back. At one point, he laid his head on my side and fell quickly asleep. Piper once again looked at me with a huge grin on her face. This whole scenario warmed my heart like it had never been before. I felt such intense joy in that moment. It was as if I had a real family for the first time in my life.

When the movie finished Piper gently picked up the little guy and brought him into his bedroom where she laid him down for the night.

""He's certainly taken a shine to you super quick!"" she said as she reentered the living room.

""Not just quick but *super* quick!"" I said jokingly. ""What can I say? Kids love me.""



That night, while lying in bed next to her, I heard tiny little footsteps headed toward the bedroom. I knew it had to be Milton, likely coming into lay with his Mom who was already fast asleep. You know how toddlers are. They fall asleep in their beds but in the morning you're waking up next to them in *your* bed. I heard the tiny feet scamper into the bedroom. I immediately got up and stood next to the bed. It was much too dark to see anything and I didn't wanna knock the little dude over so I said alouded: ""Hey, Milton, buddy. Did you wanna lay with your Mom? It's okay if you do. I'll go lay on the couch.""

Silence. 

My eyes hadn't adjusted and it was still too dark to see anything.

""Milton, I know you're in here buddy. Come over here and I'll tuck you in with your mama.""

Still silence, but... now I could hear his muffled breathing. If... that is him breathing? The breaths seemed shallow. Few and far between. The most peculiar thing though was that they sounded... deep. Like the breaths of a fully grown man. Not an innocent 3-year-old boy. This triggered panic in me almost immediately. Visions of a fully grown man standing in the bedroom just feet away from me... from us... filled my head. I made my way across the room to where I knew the light switch was as quickly as I could. I flicked on the switch and light flooded the room. After only a second or two my eyes adjusted to the light and there I saw Milton standing next to the bed. Next to his mother. He was holding his hand out and appeared to be caressing her sleeping face. My heart was beating extremely fast and I gave myself a few seconds to calm myself down. He was looking at his mother with love in his eyes. Even for a 3-year-old, you could tell he definitely loved her very much.

""Milton"" I whispered. He didn't look up at me or even flinch. He just continued caressing his mother's cheeks with that gleam in his eye.

""*Milton*!"" I whispered louder this time.

He didn't remove his hand from his mother's face but his head cocked to the side quickly and I swear I heard a cracking noise. He stared at me with a burning look in his eyes, as if he was examining me. I... can't really explain it, but he looked... older. His eyes seemed to get dark as he stared at me. Not like a toddler when they're angry but like an adult when they're furious. I'd never seen someone so young look at someone like that. I shivered. I'm being completely honest when I tell you I don't think I'd ever seen anything so terrifying in my entire life.

""M-Milton"" I stammered. He did not take his eyes off me. He had the expression of a cheetah ready to pounce. ""D-Do you, um, want me to help you into bed? So y-you can lay with your mama?""

He continued to stare at me with a deep, dark look of intense burning anger. His mouth curled into a slight smile.

""Yessss"" he said in a hiss, eyes still ablaze. He removed his hand from his mother's face and began slowly walking around the end of the bed toward me. Never taking those dark eyes off of me. His mouth still curled into that creepy little smile. As he moved, I felt an intense fear like I'd never felt before. He walked directly up to me and stared up into my eyes. They appeared almost black at this point. He put his arms in the air like he wanted to be picked up. I'm not sure why I was holding my breath. Maybe I thought it would calm me down. Without saying a word I closed my eyes, reached down, and picked Milton up. I placed him in the bed, walked over to the wall, and turned off the lights. I basically ran to the living room. I felt like I needed out of that bedroom as quickly as I could. Away from... *him...* as quickly as I could. 

There were more windows out here and the light from the street lamps shining through was welcoming to me. I lay on the couch without any blankets or pillows and tried my best to get some sleep.



After laying there for what seemed like hours, replaying the entire scenario over and over in my head I must have eventually dozed off. My dreams that night were... interesting, to say the least. All of them involved Milton.

My first dream was Milton sitting in his high chair, smoking a cigarette and playing on an iPhone. Yes, a 3-year-old smoking a cigarette. His mother tried to blame me for this which dumbfounded me. Like I would ever give a cigarette to a kid.

The second was about him being hit by a car and his mother being absolutely devastated! I remember trying to comfort her but at the same time feeling utterly relieved that he was gone forever.

The third and final dream was by far the worst. I was... trying to burn him. He and I were in an unfamiliar house with a fire blazing in the fireplace. I kept picking him up and tossing him into the fire but he just kept rolling out of it without a burn on him. I'd pick him up and toss him in again and again. Each time he rolled out, his clothes and hair were a little more burned but he was unfazed. Those eyes... That smile... With every toss, they got more terrifying. It was almost as if the fire was making him stronger. After what seemed like eight or nine tosses he finally rolled out, looked at me with literal fire in his eyes, and said in a raspy but deep voice ""Do you think you're something special, motherfucker? I'm gonna fucking kill you someday."" This is when I finally woke up. Without hesitating, I immediately grabbed my keys and left.



About 30 minutes later my cell phone rang. I looked at the caller ID and saw it was Piper. I had no idea what I was going to tell her. Was I supposed to explain to her that her 3-year-old son scared me more than I'd even been scared in my entire life? That I had dreams of him dying, or worse yet, dreams of me attempting to kill him? How about that I was sure he was breathing like a 50-year-old man in her bedroom. Or that I'm beginning to think he's possibly a demon? Finally, I answered.

""Hello?"" I said, trying to sound as normal as I possibly could.

""Robert, where did you go this morning? I woke up a few minutes ago and you weren't beside me. I got up and I noticed your car was gone."" I could tell she was sad and disappointed.

""Oh, well I actually slept on the couch last night. The little dude came in and I figured he wanted to lay with you.""

""Milton never sleeps in my room, Robert. I just don't find it ideal. Besides, if he did come sleep in here last night he's back in his own bed, fast asleep now.""

""Did you move him?""

""Huh? No. I was the only one in bed when I woke up.""

""Oh. Well, he came in there to sleep last night. I put him in bed with you and everything.""

I was finding it hard for my voice not to crack. Simply talking about him was causing my heart to race.

""Yeah, well, whatever you're doing, I need you to come back to the house.""

""I... had some plans today, Pipes"" I lied. ""Maybe we can meet up tonight though?""

""Robert, I have that stupid status update meeting in an hour and you promised me you'd watch him today, remember?""

Oh my God! I had completely forgotten about her meeting! Who even goes to meetings on a Sunday morning anyway? It's technically part of her work but is there no way she could bring Milton with her?

""I... Oh. Yes, I remember"" I said. My brain was racing trying to think up a lie as quick as I could but nothing came to mind.

""Soooo... Are you coming back to the house?"" she asked.

I sat in silence for a moment still trying to think of anything I could say to get out of this.

""Hello?"" she finally asked after a few seconds.

""Yes. Sorry, babe. Okay, I'm on my way there now. Wait. What time is your meeting?""

She sighed. ""It's at 10:30, Robert, so I need to leave here in the next 30 minutes.""

""Alrighty,"" I said. ""I'll be there in half an hour."" I knew I could have made it back to her house within five minutes but I didn't want to spend any more time there... any more time with him... than I had to.

""Okay,"" she said. ""Please hurry back. I really don't wanna be late.""

We said our ""I love yous"" and I hung up the phone.



Exactly 30 minutes later I arrived back at her home. As I pulled into the driveway she was already running out of the front door.

""Jesus, talk about taking your sweet time,"" she said angrily and rushedly. ""I didn't have time to make him breakfast because I was trying to get ready but you know where everything is. We have cereal, toast, whatever you wanna give him. He's sitting on the floor right now watching his movie. I'm gonna sneak out now so he doesn't see me leave and get upset."" 

No. We wouldn't want him getting upset, I thought. 

""I'll be back in about four hours or so. You two have fun today, okay?"" 

She got into her car and blew me a kiss. I blew her one back as she backed out of the driveway and took off down the street.



""Okay,"" I said aloud to myself and began snickering. ""You're just going crazy. He's just a toddler. Were you high last night? No? Well, something was going on. Maybe you're going crazy?""

Maybe I *was* going crazy. What really *did* happen last night? I imagined this kid as a fully grown man because I thought I heard him breathing deeply. I pissed him off because I was interrupting his time with his Mom who he very clearly loves. And I had some bad dreams.

That's it. That's all that happened. Now that I think about it, I was definitely overreacting.

Even after this realization I still stood on the front porch for another minute or two. Avoiding having to go inside the house. Avoiding having to see... *him*.

Here we go, I thought.

I opened the front door and walked into the corridor. Unlike last night, Milton did not run out to see who was there. I took off my shoes and slowly made my way into the living room.

There he was. Sitting in front of the TV drinking a juice box, just as Piper had said.

""Hey, Milton. Buddy,"" I said. Why did I sound so terrified? Probably because I was. He did not look up. Too invested in his cartoons. I walked over and stood next to the television. Now he finally saw me. Without saying a word he jumped up with a smile on his face and ran over to give me a long hug. At that moment I had an overwhelming sense of relief wash over me.

""Hey, little dude!"" I said enthusiastically. ""Are you hungry?""

""Yes!"" he replied enthusiastically back. His voice... was normal. He sounded like a child. Like a normal 3-year-old child.

""Wanna come to the kitchen with me? You can pick out whatever you like to eat."" 

Without responding, he ran into the kitchen.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Let's see what we've got."" I opened the cereal cupboard and he began jumping up and down excitedly pointing at one of the cereal boxes. ""This one?"" I asked pulling out a box of Froot Loops.

""Yes!"" he replied enthusiastically. I poured him a bowl and went to grab the container of milk from the refrigerator. ""No!"" he shouted. ""No milk!""

""Oh, you just wanna eat it dry?"" I asked him.

""Yes!"" he replied again enthusiastically.

I brought the bowl into the living room and set it on the floor where he had been watching his movie. He hopped onto the floor and reimmersed himself back into his cartoons while chomping down on his Froot Loops.

I felt immensely and utterly foolish. This was just a normal little boy. Not a boy with a man's voice. Not a boy with any sort of evil inside. He was just a normal boy.

Maybe I *was* high last night, I jokingly thought.

When Milton had finished his cereal he picked up his bowl and ran it into the kitchen. I heard him place it on the counter before running back into the living room. He plopped his butt back down on the carpet and was once again engrossed in his cartoons.

I relaxed. Piper would be back in a few hours but I didn't feel the urgency for her to return as I did before.

When Milton's movie was finished he hopped up and ran over to me with that happy smile on his face. He started moving his fingers in a tickling motion and went for my stomach.

""No! No! Don't tickle me!"" I playfully yelled as I pulled out my best fake laugh.

""Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!"" Milton yelled giggling.

""Now it's your turn to be tickled!"" I shouted as I put my hand on his belly.

""No! No! Hahahaha!""

He was having so much fun! He was laughing so hard from the tickles I was dishing out that he was drooling. That huge smile was still plastered on his face.

The app on the TV started playing a new movie and he got distracted for a moment. Suddenly this tickle game wasn't as interesting to him as he was now eagerly waiting to see which new film was about to start.

I smiled. This was actually a good little kid.



With the movie now at about halfway I smiled and looked at Milton enjoying the story.

""Can you believe I was afraid of you last night, Milton?"" I asked, knowing he wasn't even listening to me. ""I thought - I thought you were... Well, I'm not even sure what I thought.""

Without taking his eyes off the television Milton said in his childish voice, ""Oh? And why were you afraid of me?""

This came as an extreme shock to me. The only other words I'd heard him say up to this point (not counting what he was saying in my dreams last night) were 'yes,' 'no,' and 'tickle, tickle, tickle'. It wasn't just that he had spoken a complete sentence. It was how he spoke the complete sentence. Once again, it was like an adult speaking. Like an adult who is too distracted to have a conversation so they answer you automatically without thinking.

I felt the terror I'd had the previous night begin to grow in me as I stared at him.

I didn't answer him. I didn't even move. I felt paralyzed. After a moment, still with that innocent voice of a child, he repeated his question.

""Why were you afraid of me last night, Robert?""

Now he turned his head to look at me. The moment he did, I closed my eyes. I didn't know if his eyes would have looked the same way they had last night but I refused to have that image burned into my brain a second time.

I felt Milton reach onto my lap and grab the remote control. The movie he was so distracted by moments ago was now paused. He stood up on the couch next to me and I felt his tiny cold hands touching my face.

""*Open*!"" I heard him whine. ""*Open*! *Open*!""

Then he began to cry. I opened my eyes and there stood the site of a crying toddler who genuinely looked scared and concerned.

""I-I'm sorry, buddy,"" I said. He looked at me sadly and used the sleeves of his shirt to wipe his teary eyes. I genuinely didn't know how to react. ""Do you want a drink or something?""

""Yes,"" he said through his sniffles.

I walked into the kitchen and grabbed his tiny plastic cup from the cupboard. I opened the fridge and saw the juice boxes. I remembered he didn't like milk so I grabbed a juice box instead, put the cup back in the cupboard, and walked back to the living room.

When I entered Milton was no longer crying. In fact, he didn't seem sad at all. I was so confused. Imagine having a mix of terror and sympathy at the same time. My emotions were being pulled in different directions.

""Here you go, buddy,"" I said handing him the drink. He snatched it from my hands and began slurping the juice from the straw. He had finished the entire box in a matter of seconds. He then smiled at me, grabbed the remote, un-paused the TV, and went back to watching his movie.



By the time the movie had finished, I had calmed down slightly. Taking a few deep breaths and trying to focus only on the present moment seemed to work for the most part. I was trying my best to ignore everything that happened in the past 14 or 15 hours.

""Well, buddy, did you wanna watch another movie? Or what did you wanna do now?"" I asked Milton.

Then it happened again. The thing I'd feared the most babysitting Piper's son. Sitting only a couple feet from me he cocked his head to the side and his eyes went dark. Darker this time than I'd seen the night before. His face *definitely* looked older now and he smiled so big it looked almost unnatural. Almost... inhuman.

I stared back at him wide-eyed. Unable to say, or think, or do anything. My mouth suddenly went completely dry. There was no use in trying to hide my absolute terror.

He stared at me for what felt like an eternity when in reality it was likely only a few seconds. Then he opened his mouth and said in a raspy voice, ""*Agaliarept*."" It sounded like he was speaking with an accent.

He sat for another moment staring at me waiting for my reaction. That huge smile was still plastered on his face. I said nothing but you could literally see my heart beating through my chest. My face was in a twist of fear and confusion.

""*Lucifuge Rofocale*,"" he said turning his head towards the living room. His voice was even deeper and more horrifying now. It appeared as though he was speaking to someone who was not there. ""*We both know. Shall I*?"" he asked. His smile widened even larger which almost seemed impossible.



""Robert!"" Piper shouted. ""What's going on!? What's the emergency!?

""Piper you have to come home now!"" I said over the cell phone. I had run onto the porch outside while Milton was still sitting in the living room speaking with his invisible friend.

""Why!? Tell me what's going on? Is Milton okay!?""

""No!"" I screamed. ""There is something very wrong with him!""

""*What!?* Is he hurt!?""

""No. Well... I don't know!"" I had no clue what to say to her. Milton was clearly having issues. At least that's what I kept telling myself as it sounded crazy, even in my own mind, to think he was either possessed or was the physical embodiment of a demon.

""What do you mean you don't know?"" she demanded. ""Is he hurt or isn't he?""

""He's... he's swearing!"" I finally blurted out.

""Milton. Milton is swearing?"" she asked. I could tell she was having a hard time believing me.

""Yes! There's something wrong with his voice, or his throat. I think he's sick. I think he's really really sick.""

""Did you feel his forehead?"" she asked.

""Well, no. But even if I did I wouldn't be able to tell if he had a fever or not. I'm no good at that stuff.""

I just wanted her to come home as fast as she could. I couldn't be here anymore. I refused to be here. Even if I had to leave this 3-year-old by himself... They could arrest me if they wanted, as long as I never had to see him again.

""He's swearing and he has a sore throat?"" she asked again. I could tell she didn't believe me. ""How do you know he has a sore throat?""

""It's just... his voice. I can just tell. He doesn't seem okay, Pipes!""

Piper sighed on the other end of the phone.

""Robert, this meeting will be over soon. I can't believe you had them pull me out of it for this. You told them it was an emergency.""

""*It is!*"" I shouted at her.

""Robert, is everything okay with you?""

No. Nothing was okay with me. I was terrified, and panicking, and sweating, and my blood pressure was extremely high, and... ""If you really think he's sick bring him to the hospital. I'll call you as soon as the meeting's out. Okay?""

I didn't say anything. This meant she wasn't coming home right now and I'd have to watch this monster... this - this... demon, for at least another hour.

""Okay,"" I finally said.

""Love you. I'll see you soon,"" she said.

""Love you too,"" I replied and hung up the phone.

About an hour. Sixty minutes. That's it. That's not that long. It's like watching an episode of the Tonight Show. It'll be over soon.

Oh, who was I kidding? An hour with this little beast would feel like an eternity. I decided not to go back inside that house. I'd stay put here on the porch until Piper pulled back into the driveway. Without supervision maybe Milton would drown in the toilet or accidently electrocute himself. I prayed to God that would happen.



Just under an hour later Piper's SUV pulled into the driveway.

""Hey,"" she said, hopping out of her car. 

I didn't say anything. I ran to my car and got in as quickly as I could. Piper looked at me and raised her arms in confusion as I backed out of the driveway. I could see she was shouting something at me as I sped off. I refused to look back.



It's been two months now since I'd seen Piper or Milton.

The dreams... they just don't stop. And I swear they get worse every night. Milton is in all of them. Most of the time he's doing things only an adult would do like driving a car, washing the dishes, and even shooting a gun. Sometimes I dream he dies and every time I feel an overwhelming sense of relief. In some of them, I do everything in my power to kill him but it's always impossible. Either he avoids it, or it simply doesn't work. One in particular that disturbed me to my core was my attempt to feed him through a woodchipper, but the blades broke and the machine stopped working all while Milton pointed and laughed at me with those dark, evil eyes, and that deep menacing voice.

In almost every dream I've had, at some point, Milton always stares at me with those devil eyes and inhuman-looking face. He always says to me in a deep, adult-sounding, raspy voice ""*I'm going to fucking kill you, Robert.*""

I've been talking to Piper via text message on and off, but... I refuse to answer the phone when she calls. I can tell she's heartbroken. All she wants to know is what occurred that day between Milton and I which she's completely justified in knowing. Even after two months though, I had no idea what I was going to tell her.

""Milton is a demon,"" I thought about saying. ""I love you, Pipes, but I can't be around your kid."" That would only break her heart even more, or worse yet, she'd think I'd gone completely insane. But because I owed it to her and I did love her I finally answered the phone one day when she called. I told her it wasn't her, it was me. The worst thing you should say when trying to get out of a relationship but I knew it wasn't either of us. It was Milton.

I told her we could meet that night to talk but only if it was just her and I. Milton had to either be in bed or have a babysitter, or *something*. It would have been better if we could meet up in the daytime while Milton was at daycare but we both worked days and the only time we could really talk alone was at night.

Piper agreed. She told me to come over that night around 9:00 pm. Milton's bedtime was 8:00 pm so he would have been long asleep before I arrived.

I arrived on time to see Piper through her front living room window holding Milton in her arms.

""No!"" I shouted to myself. ""No, no, no, no! You're supposed to be asleep you little fucker!""

I thought about just backing out of the driveway and leaving but Piper already saw I'd pulled in. She had left the room and I prayed that she was finally laying that little demon down for the night.

I entered the house a moment later just as she was coming out of the hallway that led to the monster's bedroom.

""Okay, he's in bed,"" she said, looking sad and disappointed. I frowned at her, mimicking her sad face. ""But..."" she said, showing me her prayer hands. ""He saw you pull in and he misses you. He wants you to go in. Just say goodnight to him.""

My jaw dropped. Whatever game he had going on with me I didn't want to play. The fear that I had carried with me for the past two months had suddenly turned into anger. I'd had *enough* and planned on letting him know it. Right now.

Piper stared at me momentarily with a look of hopeful confusion.

""I - okay,"" I finally said.

She smiled. I knew she thought this would somehow make things better. She knew I'd left that day because of Milton but she still didn't have a clue as to why. This was the night I was going to tell her but apparently, first, I had a demon to speak with.

I walked down the hallway and entered his bedroom. He had a nightlight turned on beside his bed so at least I wouldn't be going in blind like I was in Piper's room the last time I'd stayed here.

The moment I entered he sat up in bed and smiled, raising his arms like he wanted a hug. My blood boiled. Here he was again pretending to be an innocent little toddler when we both knew the truth. I clenched my fists and jaw as I approached his bed.

""Good night, buddy,"" I said, trying to sound as genuine as I could. He raised his arms higher like he wanted a *big* hug. I bent down and put my arms around his back, making sure not to squeeze him too tightly.. Honestly, I wanted to crush the little fucker in that moment. I brought my face close to his ear and whispered to him: ""I'm on to you, you little piece of shit. I'm not sure what you're doing, or what game you're playing, but you and I both know you're not a normal kid. You're a demon, or a monster, or an 'I-don't-know-what.' I'm telling your Mom everything tonight and by this time tomorrow, I swear to fucking God she'll have you committed. Don't fuck with me.""

I pulled away from him and the fear that he would have transformed his face again made me immediately leave the bedroom without looking back. I didn't want to see his face ever again after this.



That night, Piper and I had a long talk. About our relationship, about how everything was going so well and for some reason I'd abruptly left. She told me that Milton was her entire world and that if he did something wrong she would punish him. She didn't want to lose me and she couldn't imagine him doing anything so horrible that I would leave. She continued to poke and prod me about what exactly happened that day but I couldn't bring myself to tell her. She very clearly didn't buy into my original story about his swearing or having a sore throat.

""I think... it's just the whole family aspect,"" I lied to her. ""I'm not used to having kids around, and I know Milton (I shivered when I said his name) is your life. I - I think I just got scared.""

""That's one hundred percent understandable!"" she spouted. ""Listen, I thought we were taking things slow in the beginning but if you think we need to slow down a little bit more, we can! Robert, I would very much love to have both you and Milton in my life.""

I knew for a fact that wasn't going to happen. I bit my lip as I just wanted to tell her the truth about everything badly but once again, I couldn't bring myself to do it. All I could picture was her screaming that I was a liar. Telling me to get the hell out and to never contact her again.

""Pipes, I just have to think about this, okay? You and Milton (God, I hated that name) seem to have a happy life together and I feel like I'm a third wheel.""

""That's crazy!"" she said. ""Milton took a shine to you right away! He loves you, Robert! He even wanted you to say goodnight to him. He knew you were coming over and refused to go to bed.""

'He's only doing that to fuck with me,' I thought.

I checked my cellphone and saw it was nearly 1:00 am.

""Okay, girl, I'm really glad we had this talk but it's getting pretty late and I think maybe I should go. If you like, you can call me tomorrow and we can continue this discussion.

""No, baby,"" she said scooting next to me. ""Can't you just stay tonight? Milton's asleep and that new lingerie I bought a couple months ago has just been sitting in my dresser drawer waiting for a 'gentleman caller.'""

When she said ""*gentleman caller*,"" she said it in one of those old-timey Southern accents. She smiled at me and gave me those eyes. Then she moved in and kissed me, pulled away and continued looking at me, waiting for my response.

I felt terrible for her. Here was a woman who had done nothing wrong, except maybe give birth to a demon, and was being punished for something her child had done without any idea as to what was going on. Why was she fighting so hard to keep me? As I stared back into her eyes I could tell she was willing to do *anything* to make this relationship work. Well, anything except let me kill that little fucker pretending to be a kid.

I sighed and grabbed her hand. ""Just tonight,"" I finally said, forcing a smile. ""But if Milton comes in the bedroom...""

""He won't!"" she said excitedly. ""He never does anyway. I'm not sure why he did the last time you were here.""



So I stayed. Against my better judgment, I stayed. Jesus, I *must* be going crazy. Or I must really love this woman. Before all this, I figured there was nothing on God's green Earth that could make me step foot back in this house while he was here, let alone spend the night. But here I was, two hours later, lying next to a sleeping Piper staring at the dark ceiling. My senses were on high alert waiting to hear tiny footsteps. I must truly love this woman because I'd never been so on edge, yet I was deciding not to leave. I felt my eyes starting to grow heavy but forcibly kept them open. The last thing I wanted to do was fall asleep. In the morning when Piper woke up, I'd make her a coffee, give her a kiss and be out the door *hopefully* before Milton woke up. But for now, I just had to stay awake. I refused to betray Piper a second time but the cost was my sleep. Possibly even my sanity. 

At one point I got up to use the washroom. That immense fear came rushing back to me as I entered that dark hallway. I envisioned Milton standing just outside the bedroom door. Waiting for me. Looking like a full-grown man. Ready to ""fucking kill me"" as he'd said in my dreams.

As I turned on the light switch in the washroom, light washed into Milton's bedroom. I stuck my head in for a quick second to see he was fast asleep under his covers. Eyes shut. Mouth open with an abundance of drool flowing out.

""Yes!"" I thought while pumping my fist. ""I hope you're having a horrible nightmare, you little fucking devil.""

I peed, washed my hands, turned off the light, and made my way back to Piper's room. I got in bed and continued staring at the ceiling, making sure to keep my senses heightened. Making sure to stay alert. Making sure under any circumstances to *not* fall asleep.



Here is where it gets scary...



I woke up maybe an hour later. It must have still been late because the bedroom was still pitch black. I rolled over to check on Piper and she was still fast asleep.

Suddenly, I heard whispers coming from every corner of the bedroom! 

*""They will deal with you and it's gonna hurt.""*

*""You don't understand the ghosts.""*

*""I am a force you cannot confront.""*

*""Acknowledge me or face my wrath.""*

*""Your pain is my pleasure.""*

All of these voices... they sounded the same! All speaking at once!

Some sounded to be speaking gibberish but it also could have been some form of Latin. My head was spinning! It sounded like they were coming from the walls but at the same time, they sounded like there was a radio transmission inside my head that was picking all of them up like a radio station!

I sat up in a complete panic! I checked on Piper again. Maybe she could hear them too? They were whispers but they were very loud so I was sure she would wake up! She did not.

""Stop!"" I shouted. ""*Stop!*""

The whispers only intensified.

*""You have no idea what you're dealing with.""*

*""We know all your business.""*

*""How dare you scare a young innocent child.""*

I covered my ears and shut my eyes.

""*Stop!*"" I shouted again. ""Stop! Stop! Stop! *Jesus Christ, stopppppp!!*""

Silence now.

I opened my eyes and looked around the room. Nothing. All I could hear now was my own heartbeat pumping in my ears and the crickets chirping outside. The voices were now gone. I was sweating profusely and my hands were shaking. I couldn't seem to catch my breath but after a moment or two, I was able to get it back to being somewhat steady.

I was breathing so heavily and shouting so loud I was surprised Piper didn't wake up.

""What the fuck?"" I said allowed and laid my head back down on the pillow facing towards Piper just as the bedroom light clicked on.

I froze. 

Who turned on the light!? My heart immediately started beating rapidly again and my mouth became dry as with light now flooding the room I could see Piper facing me. Her pitch-black eyes pierced my soul. A huge smile plastered on her face as she stuck her long black tongue out making a 'licking' motion. I let out an inaudible scream as I felt a tiny cold hand on my cheek and sharp steel pressing down on my neck. Milton leaned forward and whispered in my ear in an evil, deep, adult-sounding voice ""*I told you I'd kill you, fucker*"" as he pulled the blade across my throat.

As I lay there blinded, choking and bleeding, knowing I was about to die, I could hear two distinct deep voices speaking to each other in thick accents.

*""You did good, mother.""*

*""Thank you, Agaliarept. Now get some sleep. We dispose of this one in the morning and tomorrow night my new boyfriend Dawson is coming over to meet you.""*

1ipngoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1ipngoc/normal/,Normal ?,I’m not Nepalese I am Scottish by nationality but I grew up in Liverpool England. My partner is from and lives in London and I visit often. On a visit we recently went to a restaurant that was previously Indian that had now been bought by a Nepalese chain. When we went it was one of the first nights it was open and we loved it we spoke with a waiter who was very polite. Same age as us and all normal. Came back today for Valentine’s Day and all normal again he was very polite and remembered us even got us special drinks. He then asked for my number and if I wanted to meet I said I can do tomorrow morning before the gym for coffee. He brought over his cousin who is a chef to meet me and said he will be coming as well. This was all in front of my partner and was all very well mannered I didn’t get any bad vibes. But is this a normal Nepalese thing? To be so forward and friendly especially to a customer. Any advice is appreciated my partner just implanted some anxiety in my head with it being London and all crazy stuff happens. ,2,1739573822.0,NepalSocial,4,1.0,False
1ipngjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1ipngjj/cheers_from_dryville/,Cheers From Dryville,"Never a big drinker, I enjoy ales socially and love supporting local breweries. The buzz after three 6.5% IPA draughts at a bar with friends is a golden moment peak. It’s been a mainstay session.

“Strong Beer / Strong Coffee” lived in my Instagram profile for years. Seasonal beers were irresistible unicorns to behold. Trips to the local distributor led to lengthy stays in the aisles, examining the elaborate case and label designs. Liquor and wine meant nothing to me.

Beer was a social pillar for me since I first cracked open my first Milwaukee’s “Beast” in college. Recently, I wanted to explore what a long period of time would feel like, for my mind and body, with zero booze. I went on and off for a couple years. The longest I went without a sip was 6 months. Big whoop, I know. Here’s some observations:

# Better Sleep

Sleep become more even-keeled, deeper, and uninterrupted. Even just 6 hours of sleeps did the trick.

When drunk, the reduced REM sleep and deep sleeps are unattainable. I’d often wake up at 3am and have to watch TV to fall back asleep, or just stare at the ceiling for hours. And then the next day, hungover, I’d be exhausted.

# Tightened Stomach?

This was just a bonus, but belly fat reduced rather quickly. What changed? Well, with even a modest buzz, I’d engage in a midnight 4th meal of the day and then feel that I deserved a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich from a heated lamp at Wawa the next day, just to take the edge of. Without this intake, and without the calories of double-IPAs, weight loss just happened.

# Fitness Focused

I don’t go to a gym. Swaying free weights in the basement, doing planks and yoga in the family room, and biking around town are enough for me. But while drinking, the next day created those “off” sensations where you couldn’t do anything but watch streaming shows under a blanket. Without the booze, my fitness routine was always welcoming, unhindered.

# Work Day Focus

Whether working from home or in the office, the focus throughout the day became better maintained. Any “brain fog” or dire 3pm crashes were no longer there. With sleep quality strengthened, work day attentiveness didn’t drag.

# Money Savings

Cases of locally crafted IPAs are expensive. This was a monthly budget line item that I could remove. Whatever your liquor or beer choices are, you’ll save money without having to restock your supply. You’ll also never have to use Uber or Lyft and deal with having to retrieve your car from a vacant parking lot the following day.

# Hobbies Accomplished

More attuned all day, I had more dedicated time for hobbies and projects that I was working on around the house. The passions in my life outside of marketing became easily reached and more was accomplished.

# Energy & Emotions

The days-long hangover malaise and alcohol-induced mood disruption were not missed. They weren’t there to destroy my energy or alter my emotions. Having Gilbert Syndrome, my hangovers were often devastating.

If you Google the benefits that your organs experience from abstaining from alcohol, it’s nothing but good news. For brain health alone, decisions making is improved, anxiety is reduced, mood swings are lessened, cognitive function is improved. These all felt achieved. But are the enzymes level of my liver increased? No idea.

# Face Time

The typical old man bags under my eyes are never going away, but the ***extended*** bags, combined with bloodshot blue eyes, were never present. My skin seemed to look a bit healthier as well, but maybe it’s just that gifted shea butter I received? Not sure.

# Bar Scene

My initial concern was that I’d be given a hard time for being a teetotaler sipping on a virgin Moscow Mule. But, out and about, nobody cared. Most didn’t even ask what I was drinking. Whether I was out watching the Phillies, at an industry conference, or at my own 50th birthday party, nobody was concerned at what I was drinking or what level of drunkenness I was at. It’s all about being present and having fun together, which leads me to…

# Necessary Good Times Elixir?

With so many “crazy nights” tagged over the years, I wondered if alcohol was a necessary component of socializing in a boisterous, crowded bar. Did I need it to be witty and fun? Absolutely not. And I never have issues talking with strangers filter-free, so that 7.8% ABV lubricant isn’t needed. I didn’t require 2 drinks just to calm down or loosen up.

# NA Options

I’ve never dabbled with non-alcoholic beers aside from Heineken 0.0 and O’Doul’s Premium, both of which taste awful to me.  Athletic Brewing Company, from Connecticut, which you’ll find in big box stores and more often at bars, has two IPAs that actually taste great. I realized that I missed the aromatic smattering of hops such as Citra, Simcoe and Chinook, and these beers allowed me to enjoy the taste and fragrance. My favorite NA beers are from Illinois-based Go Brewing, which boast bold, unique can design.

Local to the Philly area, there is a store in Ardmore, PA called Wallace Dry Goods that holds NA events, such as zero-proof cocktail workshops. They also sell glassware and gift sets, along with NA spirits, beer, cider and wine. 

# Shame Free

The awful shame of being hungover around my kids no longer existed. And the late night act of coffee and a cake based dessert at a restaurant to help “sober up”, in the hopes of driving home safely, was obviously no longer there either.",5,1739573812.0,SoberCurious,1,0.86,False

I'm gonna be taking a vacation with my best friend to Melbourne from March 9th to March 15th. It's my first vacation I've ever planned solo!! 

We're both really into skateboarding and music, so we definitely want to check out the local music scene and the coffee culture. 

I'm hoping for some advice from y'alls, here's a few questions I had for you <3



1) **Underground Music Venues?** Are there any dope rock/punk/whatever music venues that we might not know about? And are they cheap?

2) **Must-go coffee shops?** I'm a bit of a coffee snob, and love coffee shops that have SUPER high quality coffee (Ethiopian / Yemeni).

3) **Street-skating spots?** This is a long shot, but if anyone on this reddit is (or knows a) local skateboarder, we'd love to hear about some spots to hit, and how much trouble we can get in (we don't know the laws down unda').

4) **What else?** We've got a whole week in MEL, and want to do awesome stuff for cheap, but have no idea where to start. Surfing? Bar hopping? Skydiving? Hell yeah, we're in for everything!!



Thank you guys so much! We're just looking for cool stuff / people in your hometown, so any advice is appreciated!! ",0,1739573805.0,melbourne,127,0.45,False
