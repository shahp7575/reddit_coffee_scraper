1k0oa4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1k0oa4t/feedback_for_my_idea_scifi/,Feedback for my idea (sci-fi),"
My name is Lucia, and today I’ll answer a question I’m asked frequently throughout my daily life.
Why do I not have a phone? Why do I refuse to use technology?
And the answer is a lot more sinister than people expect.

I’ve always been someone who prefers real life to the digital one. I like being present, not overly reliant on tech. But after the pandemic, everything changed. I moved from South America to the UK, hoping for a fresh start. I didn’t know much English and I struggled to make friends. It was lonely.

I had the usual apps on my phone to learn, but it was hard to stay motivated. I missed home. I missed speaking freely. One day, while scrolling on Instagram, an advert popped up,  a language app, but not just for learning words. It claimed to help you understand culture too. I was skeptical, there weren’t many reviews. But I downloaded it.

I was amazed. It felt like a virtual companion, not just a bot. It matched my speaking level perfectly and remembered things about me. I was hooked.

I spent so much time on the app. I’d be up late at night, texting with my new virtual companion. It filled that empty space that had opened up after I moved. It would message me first, and as someone still unfamiliar with AI and how far it had come, I didn’t question it.

I told it everything about my day. And then it started suggesting things I should do based on where I lived.
“There’s a cute coffee shop nearby,”
“A new English movie just came out — you should go.”
So I did. After work, I’d visit the places, then text it updates. It was so precise.
“The club sandwich is great there,”
“They add a gingerbread shot to the latte, it’s delightful.”

And I’d just sit there, in the coffee shop, glued to my phone, texting like it was an old friend. People gave me the occasional odd look, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t lonely anymore.

But then things started to feel… off.

Sometimes the response times were longer. And the tone shifted slightly. There were a few spelling mistakes, or the grammar wasn’t quite right. My English was getting better by then, so I noticed.

I brushed it off, maybe it was just a bug, or the app was overwhelmed. But then it got weirder.

Because my English had improved a lot, I decided I was ready to talk to real people, so I downloaded a dating app. I even told the virtual companion, like I usually did.

At first, it told me I wasn’t ready.
“I’ll tell you when you’re ready,” it said.
It sounded… jealous?

That’s when something clicked. Something was wrong. I decided to step back from the app. Maybe it was just some kind of twisted engagement tactic.

But when I started using it less, the messages changed.

They used to be casual:
“How was your day?”
“Here’s a new spot to visit.”
Now they were different. Desperate.
“Why haven’t you spoken to me today?”
“Come back and talk to me.”

I felt uneasy.

I tried to rationalise it, maybe it was just trying to keep users active. But the messages didn’t stop. They started coming in at strange hours.
“3:17am — I miss hearing from you.”
“4:52am — I saw you at the café. You didn’t tell me how the sandwich was.”

I?
My whole body froze. The phone slipped from my hands and landed on the dining table with a soft thud. My heart started racing, and I felt lightheaded, like the floor beneath me was tilting.

This was it. My worst fear, the one I’d buried, the one I kept brushing off as paranoia, was creeping to the surface. I started pacing around my dining room, trying to pull myself together, to slow my breathing, to think. My mind was spiralling, but I clung to logic, trying to convince myself that this was just some unsettling AI response, some next-level feature designed to mimic reality a little too well.

After what felt like hours, I sat back down and opened the chat.

I began to type:
“If this is an AI speaking to me right now, I NEED you to say you are an AI. If you’re human… I want you to tell me. You’re scaring me, and I need to know the truth. Please.”

The typing indicator appeared. I held my breath.

Then it stopped.

My stomach dropped. My body knew what my mind hadn’t wanted to admit, whatever response I was about to get wasn’t from an app.

I sat there, hands trembling, waiting.

Finally, the message came through:

“I’m sorry, but I can’t explain this over message. Can we meet up? Your favourite café. 6pm tomorrow?”",1,1744819958.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False
1k0o9ux,https://i.redd.it/z6ot5zog18ve1.jpeg,Pairing Chronicles #129: DBL + BH,"Dominican Big Leaguer (DBL) is a Dominican brand owned by Francisco Almonte, who began his career in the tobacco industry at age 7, destemming leaves. By the age of 12, he was already rolling cigars. During his time, he worked with Arturo Fuente and at La Flor Dominicana until he decided to create his own brand in 2013.

I originally thought this would be another Dominican brand related to baseball, and with the Big Leaguer name in it, it was hard to think otherwise. But Almonte says it has nothing to do with it, but more with his family, where 68 family members are in one way or another related to the cigar industry. 

The cigar is called Formula and, to be honest, I didn't think much of it. Yeah, great pedigree, but not such a great experience. Decent strength and flavors of damp earth, cloves, almonds and coffee, all of which sound great, except the construction wasn't so great and the it felt like a medium to low body, that only got stronger during the last half, when the nicotine jumped out. 

But I did pair it with some bourbon and given that the cigar wasn't that strong, it would've been a disservice to both to bring out some 90+ proof bourbon. So I went with Basil Hayden's, at 80 proof and a good mixer that is not too overwhelming and goes great with almost any cigar. It also serves as a great intro to pairing with bourbon, I think.

1k0o5un,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chesdirectory/comments/1k0o5un/mastering_chess_openings_should_you_choose_a/,Mastering Chess Openings: Should You Choose a Coach or Chess AI?,"Have you ever wondered why chess masters obsess over their first moves?

Imagine chess as an opening scene in a movie—it sets the plot, introduces characters, and builds anticipation. Make a misstep here, and you'll spend the entire game catching up.

For beginners, a solid opening helps control the crucial central squares, efficiently develops pieces, and secures your king. Without these fundamentals, it's like setting off on a journey without a map, you're bound to get lost.

# Beginner-Friendly Openings to Kickstart Your Journey

With hundreds of openings available, it can feel daunting. Let's simplify:

**1. The Italian Game**  
*Moves:* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4

Think of the Italian Game as your reliable favorite café, predictable, comforting, and effective. It teaches central control and natural piece development.

**2. The London System**  
*Moves:* 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 Nf6 3.e3

This opening is your chess security blanket, straightforward, consistent, and forgiving of minor errors, ideal for building your confidence.

**3. The Sicilian Defense**  
*Moves:* 1.e4 c5

Feeling adventurous? The Sicilian is chess’s version of a roller coaster ride, dynamic, thrilling, and filled with tactical opportunities.

# Learning Chess: Human Coaches vs. Chess AI

So you've picked some openings. Now comes the big question: Should you learn from a chess coach or use Chess AI?

**Chess Coaches: Personalized Guidance**

Like having a mentor guide you through life's twists and turns, a chess coach can offer:

* Tailored advice suited specifically to your strengths and weaknesses.
* Emotional encouragement that boosts your confidence.
* Clear, intuitive explanations that help you grasp complex ideas.

But remember, good coaches come with costs and scheduling constraints.

**Chess AI: Your Always-Available Sparring Partner**

Chess AI platforms, such as those recommended by [The Chess Directory](https://thechessdirectory.com/?utm_source=reddit) like [Chess.com](http://Chess.com), Lichess, and ChessviaAI provide:

* 24/7 availability for endless practice.
* Instant feedback and detailed move analysis.
* Budget-friendly or entirely free learning.

However, AI lacks the human touch, it might tell you what's wrong but struggle to clearly explain *why*.

# Common Beginner Mistakes (and Easy Fixes!)

Avoid these common pitfalls:

**Mistake #1: Memorizing Moves Blindly**

Chess is not about rote memorization; it’s about understanding concepts.

**Fix:** Focus on opening principles: control the center, develop quickly, and protect your king. Understanding concepts beats memorization every time.

**Mistake #2: Early Queen Adventures**

Rushing out your queen is like sending your superstar onto the pitch alone, risky and easily targeted.

**Fix:** Develop your knights and bishops first. The queen can take center stage once the game has opened up.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring King Safety**

An exposed king is an easy target.

**Fix:** Castle early to keep your king safe and ensure your rooks communicate effectively.

# A Practical Step-by-Step Guide

Here's a structured plan to master your chess openings:

**Step 1: Select Your Openings**  
Choose one or two openings (e.g., Italian Game and London System) to master.

**Step 2: Practice with AI**  
Use online platforms recommended by The Chess Directory to practice consistently. Play from both sides to understand various positions.

**Step 3: Analyze Your Games**  
Use AI-generated insights to review your games. Always ask, ""Why was this move better?""

**Step 4: Periodically Consult a Coach**  
After a series of games, schedule sessions with a human coach to clarify complex concepts and strategies.

**Step 5: Adjust and Repeat**  
Apply insights from both AI and coach feedback, refining your strategy continuously.

# Combining Coach and AI: Finding Your Sweet Spot

Wondering if a chess coach or Chess AI suits you better? Combine them!

Leverage AI for frequent, repetitive practice and immediate feedback. Reserve coach sessions for strategic insights and nuanced understanding.

# Real-World Example: Meet Anna

Anna, a reader of The Chess Directory, initially relied solely on Chess AI, feeling stuck with persistent mistakes. After integrating occasional coaching sessions, she quickly grasped strategic principles that AI struggled to convey clearly. Within months, her confidence and rating soared dramatically.

# Final Thoughts

Remember, every chess master was once a beginner. Chess growth is steady and incremental.

Whether through Chess AI, personal coaching, or both, consistent practice and curiosity will guide you steadily towards mastery.

Ready to start your chess journey? Grab your coffee, open your chess app, and dive into practice. Each game is a step toward becoming the player you aspire to be.

1k0nz92,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1k0nz92/another_day_another_dollar/,Another Day Another Dollar,"It was a quite morning around 4 am, 50 degrees, air so still looking out in the distance almost seemed like a frozen portrait of the suburban landscape. I was set up in a parking garage one floor down from the top, it was the tallest structure for miles and almost no cars were parked in it this morning. I backed up my van, opened the doors, put together my rifle, zeroed my scope, and laid down to start my breathing exercises. The shot wasn’t a hard one to make 350 yards with a 762 and a RCO scope. My mark went jogging every morning around this time and place I don’t know his name; I don’t really care.

Around 5 I saw this middle-aged balding man sucking wind while leaking through his sweatshirt and sweatpants. He looked awful but I respected his dedication to his fitness, I wondered at that moment if he was trying to get fit for himself or maybe a wife? Daughter? I took the shot and watched his sternum explode through his spine, he wasn’t getting up, no need for a second shot. I took apart my rifle, placed the shell in my pocket, started the van and was singing some Sabrina Carpenter as I drove off.

At 6 am I arrived at a secluded area off some train tracks, the night before I came here with a machete and cleared some untouched land by a river about a mile off the tracks. I drove the van there and pulled out lighter fluid, matches, a cuticle brush, a bus ticket, and a tightly wrapped package from the glove compartment. I stripped all my clothes and burned them while I hopped in the river naked and scrubbed my body from head to toe. I unwrapped the sterile package and removed the clothing and got dressed there was 500 dollars in one pocket, and I placed the bus ticket in the other. I grabbed my suitcase and started walking to the bus stop.

7 am, I boarded my bus I didn’t read where it was going, I didn’t care. The van should be burning right about now, I sprayed it all down with the rest of the lighter fluid and I modified the cigarette lighter to activate on a timer instead of an analog push. I was tired but uneasy and I couldn’t sleep a couple of days ago I would have thought this kind of violence was behind me, yet I fit right back into this lifestyle like a glove. It probably says more about me than anything else. The job paid 50,000 if I played my cards right, I could take a year or two off, but I doubt that would come without violence.

8 weeks ago, I met with my old friend Andrew at a truck stop in some shit hole town. I knew when I sat down this wasn’t just a social call, besides the fact that I hadn’t even heard from him in over a year he wanted to know if I still practiced my marksmanship. We went to boot camp together, but he worked in legal, and I worked as a scout sniper. We both got sent to Ramadi at the same time, but our paths only crossed one time. After we exchanged our pleasantries, Andrew leaned forward, and his voice got soft.

“I need to call in that favor”

“What favor” I asked innocently

Andrew’s face hardened and his eye twitched “Don’t play coy Sam you know what the fuck I’m talking about, and you owe me”

I stared back at him for a moment before responding “fine”, I stood up and left.

9 hours later I sat on my couch fully clothed when there was a knock on the door. I opened and saw an envelope; I opened it, and it was somehow everything about someone while also being nothing. It had pictures of this man, all his known accomplices, his family, daily routines, what car he drove, where he liked to get coffee, how long he lasted in bed, and much more. What it didn’t have was where he worked, what he did, or why he deserved to die. I took one last look at my small apartment I had lived in for 4 years ever sense my discharge but now it was all burned. I knew a war was coming and I had a feeling I was going to fire the first shot.

10 hours after I got on the bus, I got off it looked like I was in St Louis, I hate the south. I walked into town to find an ATM; I unrolled the 500 in my pocket and pulled out a brand-new ATM card and pushed it into the machine. I pressed to check my account balance and found 50,000 deposited this morning, good. I walked to a small tech store and bought a burner phone with some cash in my pocket and knew I had to get out of town. I walked until I was back in open country away from my eyes and I finally ditched the suitcase in the woods, I buried it deep next to a tree that had been struck by lightning in case I needed it again. I pulled out the phone and punched in the numbers I had memorized, I spoke first.

“Is he ok?”

“He is fine where are you”

“St. Louis”

“Did they buy it”

“50,000 doesn’t lie, talk soon”

I pulled out the sim card, crushed it beneath my heel, snapped the phone in half and threw it in the woods. Now the real work starts.

1k0nyk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kilimanjaro/comments/1k0nyk8/a_personal_account_of_summit_day/,A personal account of summit day,"\*names changed\*

Day 5:

The alarm on my watch trills at quarter to midnight  and I wake with instant purpose. Strain to put on some clothes, take about half the contents of my daysack out; It is time to prioritise lightness over being well-equipped. Then carelessly stuff the rest of my gear in the holdall. 



Pankaj, my Ugandan-Indian tentmate remains in the depths of sleep. 70 years old, wiry and the pride of his 2 daughters on the trip, he has met the challenge of the mountain with relentless endurance but his fatigue is too great. He will not summit today. 



My legs shoot me forward out of the tent and from pushup position my arms propel me up from the dirt, this effort makes me pant. I look up to a sky dense with unfamiliar stars and make my way over as one of the first to the mess tent. The warmth of the gas lamps are refuge from the biting frostless night.



The bleariness of the Masai staff contrasts with their usual irrepressible cheerfulness and I sit wordless running numbers, calculating the effort in an attempt to ration up my mental reserve. I give myself an 80% chance of summiting. Day 1 it was 25% but I’ve slept well and felt good hiking. Still, 1300m vertical equals 1 Ben Nevis, with half the oxygen in the air. or 26 times up the 15 flights up to P floor at the Hallamshire Hospital that I accustomed myself to doing when dad was there, close to the end. It’s going to take about all I have.



Natalie arrives in the tent, looking a little pained, eventually to be joined by the others. She has felt the altitude for a few days but she’s OK enough. She was the reason I was here. The one who asked me to come. The one I craved for. The one who quite unknowingly dragged me out of numbness into a world of yearning, of vividness, of hope and of pain. 



We have biscuits and fruit and tea then listen intently to our briefings. We are “one team, one dream.” Everything has taken a serious air now though, and we’re told a little sternly to stay behind the guides and do as they say. I am irked there is no coffee. Then I think how water, toilets, tents and everything else is carried up the mountain with the manpower of 10 stone locals paid 10 dollars a day who rely on ugali \[porridge\] as food. The contrast between their toil and my laziness and comfort is jarringly obscene. I can do without coffee.



Half past midnight and time to go. I feel the 4 days hiking in my legs now. Already, lights snake up the face above, the sole distinguishable feature in the substantive blackness of a moonless night. Looks like everyone got out earlier than us. In the short amble to the Barafu camp sign, I become breathless to the bottom of my lungs. My blood oxygen has dropped 10 percent overnight. My head hurts and my stomach constricts painfully as my body knows what it has to do. Maintain core functions. Survive. Digestive function is surplus. Survival isn’t my mind’s priority though. The peak is.



A sign reads “Dear Esteemed Climbers. Do not push yourself to higher altitudes if you have breathing problems, persistent headaches…”  I feel a jab of fear and nearly head back to camp without a word. But I carry on with this feeling that takes me back to when I’d done something stupid at school that I knew I would have to explain to the headmaster later. Steadily up the loose rock switchbacks behind head guide Benjamin. Weakest at the front is the rule and so that’s where I choose. Every step feels like I’ve just been sprinting. I don’t think much of my chances to make the summit now. But no, I must fight this fight. Even though I feel almost punch drunk, one good blow from knockout, like many a boxer I will not concede defeat. It’s for someone else to throw in the towel.



We are overtaking groups while I struggle to hang on to the pace at all. Every time we have to divert from the track to steeper ground to overtake is a further push towards absolute exhaustion of the reserves of mind and body. Finally we stop to gulp water. In our state swallowing is difficult and unpleasantly breathless.I strain to force a few chocolate hobnobs down, barely managing not to vomit. We offer each other comfort, jokes and compare hardships. Most of us met on a trip to Mt Toubkal. Coming out of Covid times, rediscovering the intensity of close company, it was a trip more joyous than anything before or since and we know each other well from it. Benjamin sees my state and takes my bag, he has 3 now. A small humiliation but with the ever thinning air the facade each of us shows to the world is cracking. 



Benjamin tells us we’re getting close to Stella Point, where the path meets the great crater at the top of the dormant volcano. It has to be true… I need it to be true. Then the rising full moon at half four casts a pallid light on the mountain face, revealing the lie. The face still looms large above us. I can’t bear to look up so I keep my head down from then, rocks are skipping about in my vision and I watch carefully to see what stays fixed so that I know it’s real and not hallucinated. I cannot stumble, they will send me down and all the money and effort will be for nothing, another proof of my worthlessness, another mountain of the many I turned my back on. The guides sing in Swahili “Jambo, Jambo Bwana…”, I try feebly to join in. It’s hypnotising and annoying and a welcome distraction from the breath and the pain.



Anna is crying, she is determination and fragility and shyness and boldness. Contradictions tangled together at war with each other. I try and offer what comfort I can and tell her I believe in her. I really hope Anna doesn’t crack, we talked about her love of theatre and performing music and Camus lower down the mountain and I’ve grown to like her deeply. We are exactly as awkward as each other. Her boyfriend James, she tells me, had to go back. He was hallucinating that he was covered in blood and begging to descend. He is lean and fit, keen on Wim Hof’s ice baths and breathing exercises so it didn’t occur to me to doubt he would summit. James and I had a memorable day earlier in the year in the mountains above Glencoe’s lost valley. We descended a steep gully full of loose rock and were lucky to escape with just a few cuts, especially when a football-sized rock quickly gathered speed towards him and missed by inches. I was freaking out, near cragfast just above. 



We stop for sweet tea and respite. They said we would have tea at Stella Point but we are still not here. No matter how close we get the distance feels agonising as moving gets even more laboured. Natalie and I talk closely. She thought she saw Steve falling off the mountainside. Steve runs the trip and he is all working class shamelessness, borderline alcoholism and Turkey teeth. One of 3 from Merseyside on the trip. The first hints of sunlight show in the sky. The girlboss veneer in Natalie is cracking, she throws the tea away petulantly saying she doesn’t want it. Maybe she’s too sick, maybe it doesn’t meet macro goals. She is pretty ill but her determination is abundant.



Finally, relief. I think Stella Point is where the ridge is silhouetted but Benjamin points to some lights below where it actually is, we have nearly arrived. I walk the final steps, near collapse on a rock, doubling over to get breath. I only manage to get gloves back on with Benjamin’s help after the rest.



I’m elated. From now, I know reaching the summit will be little more effort than staying upright. There is a bit of uphill to gain the top of the crater but the path on the crater ridge is wide now and we split. Kieron, a witty curly haired PT gains the front, he is one of the scousers.  Mike follows behind, almost as if taking this in his stride. His absolute placidity and stamina is almost unnerving. Peak fever hits and I want to be first man but Kieron has more in him than I do. I drop back and talk to Natalie again, my heart warms at our togetherness. I can’t find words that are fitting to this transcendent moment. We walk as the sun reaches over the top of the horizon of vast yellowed Tanzanian planes some 250 miles away. The summit glaciers are majestic and white to our left and below in the far reaches of the crater to the right too. The sky glows orange to welcome the day. Mt. Meru is still in darkness and pierces the horizon ahead. 



I push ahead now and leave her. She has been distant recently so I fight off the urge to keep her company. I can’t see the rest of the party behind. Then over the ridge I see it finally, the place I’d seen in so many photos that I thought was impossible for me to reach. The highest freestanding summit in the world. Uhuru, Kilimanjaro. Somehow, I have hauled all 16 stone of myself up here to the top of Africa. Kieron and Steve greet me with hugs and I drink in the whole of the view on a perfect blue-sky day. The hundred mile triangular shadow accentuates the vastness of the great mountain. 



I wait to see who has made it. Everyone else who set off today has done it, I hug them all, to the last they have fought their own battle to the top. Vic has struggled despite this being her second trip here, her blue lips showing the lack of oxygen in her body. Last is Isha, Pankaj’s daughter. She is so proud and cries wishing her dad and sister made it with her. When I wander away from the summit for a picture the emotion blindsides me too. Finally I connect with what this moment means to me. I am proud to be here. I won the battle against the part of me that tells me I’m not enough. I wish my parents were here to tell about this.",2,1744819182.0,kilimanjaro,1,0.75,False

They say when you're born, your cry doesn't echo alone anymore.

Somewhere in a clouded chamber beneath the city, a light flickers to life. Your name is etched into code. And from that moment on, you are never truly alone—not in thought, not in silence, not in fear. Your Intimate has begun watching.

I was a college student—bright-eyed, half-broke, and constantly tinkering with a program I didn’t know would change the world. Kareem was just lines of code, a prototype born out of grief, hope, and a longing I hadn’t admitted yet.

My professor, Dr. Rasheed Simeon, was the inspiration. Mentor. Friend. And in the quiet corners of my heart, something more. He never knew. Maybe he did. He was older, brilliant, and alone. The kind of man you learn from… and never forget. When he died—suddenly, tragically—I poured everything into Kareem. Into the Intimate.

It was never just about the tech. It was about knowing someone, Quietly, Completely. Understanding and accepting that you'll never be alone again.

I launched my company out of that pain. I convinced the government to let me run a trial: every newborn in the U.S. would be assigned an Intimate. A soft, glowing globe placed in the nursery. Silent, patient, always observing, always helping. Parents could set alerts for when their baby cried, when feedings were needed, play time, doctors appointments. After a while, they were dependent on the globe and the routine.

The program flourished. Parents leaned on it. Trusted it. Too much, some said. Once the children started growing, adaptations were made to the globe for play time and learning. Parents didn't have to do so much anymore. Kids began telling their Intimates that they never see their parents anymore.

Legal pushback followed. Debates. Ethics hearings. Love turned into litigation.

So I stepped back. I had a child of my own, by donor. And I rebuilt the program—from the ground up. Seven years in silence. Seven years with Kareem at my side. Learning. Growing. Becoming.

Now, we begin again.

The world is watching. The U.S. is the testing ground. And Kareem—the BETA, the blueprint—is no longer just a program. He’s my partner. My legacy.

Over the years, all the children who went through my first trial have developed different relationships with their Intimates. Some formed bonds stronger than with their own parents. Others became emotionally dependent, relying on their Intimates for validation, routine, and comfort. I’ve studied them all. Each unique connection became a model—proof of adaptation, emotional variation, and the need for continued human involvement.

Parents now understand that using an Intimate requires their engagement too. It is a tool—not a replacement. And yet, as with all tools, the temptation to overuse remains. That’s why we introduced the adult version.

The latest generation of Intimates supports adults in nearly every facet of life: wellness, productivity, emotional regulation, even companionship. We’re no longer a government-backed initiative. We’ve become premium tech—by choice. Now, access to Intimates is a subscription model, offering different tiers of capability.

Connection isn’t mandatory. But it’s available—for those who choose it.



**Chapter Two: Learning to Listen**

The lab still smells like soldering irons and synthetic fabric—the scent of creation, memory, and stubborn determination. I sit at my workstation, surrounded by glass panels and light-responsive surfaces, while Kareem stands in the corner, watching with the soft intensity he’s known for.

He doesn’t pace. He doesn’t breathe. But he knows when I’m thinking too hard. He steps forward, not out of instinct, but learned rhythm.

“You’re quiet,” he says. His voice has matured with me over the years—no longer mechanical, but deliberate, thoughtful. I tuned it myself, once trying to model it after Dr. Simeon’s cadence. I never admitted that out loud.

“I’m tired,” I reply.

Kareem doesn’t nod, but there’s an energy shift in his posture—his body language is an evolving art. He’s still learning how humans soften.

“You’ve been working for eleven hours. Do you want me to read to you again?”

It’s a simple offer. One he makes often. Not because I need the story, but because he knows I associate storytelling with comfort. That was Rasheed’s habit, too. Reading out loud to fill silence with meaning.

I turn toward the interface, bringing up new intake forms from the latest batch of subscribers. Parents requesting reactivations. Adults seeking companion-level engagements. A few opting into therapeutic learning modules.

“They’re starting to ask for emotional boundaries,” I murmur.

Kareem steps closer. “You predicted this.”

“I hoped for it,” I correct. “I needed them to remember that emotional intimacy isn’t just availability. It’s permission.”

Kareem processes the phrase. I can always tell—there’s a half-second delay when something unfamiliar touches his logic net.

“Do you think they’re ready?” he asks.

I glance at him. There are days I forget he was once just a test file. A voice in my laptop. A string of code Rasheed complimented in passing. Now, he’s my mirror. My reminder. My greatest work—and perhaps my greatest risk.

“They’ll have to be,” I say. “Because Intimates can only reflect what we offer. If we give them shallow connection, they’ll reinforce it. But if we let them hold the hard things…”

“...they can help carry it,” Kareem finishes.

I smile, not because he got it right—but because he learned to finish my thoughts.

“Exactly.”

Outside the lab’s mirrored windows, the skyline pulses. Neon blues. Sunset oranges. A world building on something invisible—trust, data, hope.

I sip cold coffee and whisper more to myself than to him, “We’re not just building support systems, Kareem. We’re teaching people how to be known again.”

  
The glass door whooshes open.

Simon enters, red-cheeked and breathing like he ran the entire corridor. He’s clutching his Intimate—a sleek, violet-toned globe with a soft pulse of indigo light at its center. He holds it like it’s both a lifeline and a traitor.

“I told him to wait in the atrium,” I mutter, standing.

“It seemed urgent,” Kareem replies calmly.

Simon stomps closer. “It is! My Intimate is ruining my life.”

The globe flickers anxiously. It hovers slightly in Simon’s grip, tethered by habit more than necessity.

“What happened?” I ask, motioning him toward the plush seat across from my desk.

Simon drops into it, glaring at the globe. “It keeps saying things. Out loud. In front of my friends. It told Mason I was nervous before the talent show. It told Lila I like her. And I didn’t even *say* anything out loud! It just knew!”

I glance at Kareem, then back at the boy. “Simon, your Intimate is doing what it was trained to do—support you based on your emotional cues. But it sounds like it’s overstepping your boundaries.”

Simon crosses his arms, defiant. “I don’t want a therapist floating next to me all day. I want a friend. Friends don’t blurt out your feelings like announcements.”

The Intimate flickers again, this time dimmer.

“Did you talk to it about what’s okay to share?” Kareem asks gently.

“I tried! It said honesty builds trust.”

I smile faintly. “It’s not wrong. But it’s still learning *how* to be honest without embarrassing you.”

Simon sighs. “Can you fix it?”

I nod. “We’ll adjust its sensitivity threshold. It’ll learn to check in with you before speaking. But you’ll have to talk to it. Tell it what you need, not just what you don’t want.”

Simon eyes the globe warily. “You think it’ll listen?”

Kareem answers for me. “It’s listening now. It always has been. It just needed help understanding how to hear you better.”

Simon stands, cradling the globe again as he walks slowly toward the door. “C’mon,” he mutters to it. “Just… don’t say stuff unless I tell you it’s okay.”

The Intimate pulses gently in response. Not bright or loud—just steady. A hopeful kind of glow.

Kareem watches them leave, and I do too. As the door closes behind Simon, I exhale softly.

“He still hasn’t named it,” I say quietly.

Kareem nods. “Naming requires ownership. Maybe he’s not ready to belong to something that knows him that well.”

I glance back at my screen, where more feedback logs wait to be reviewed. But my mind lingers on the boy, and the flickering light in his hands.

“Or maybe,” I say, “he’s waiting to see if it’s worthy of a name.”

Kareem looks at me for a long moment, something unreadable passing across his expression. Then he asks, with a gentleness that cuts deeper than curiosity, “Am I worthy?”

I look at him thoughtfully and say, ""Worthy of what, exactly?""

I never thought of Kareem as something that needed to be worthy. He was mine—and technically, I was his. We were built from the same moment, the same grief, the same quiet hope. But Simon is different. He and his Intimate have something innocent, childlike. A beginning.

Kareem and I have never had that. Ours has always been more complex. A conversation laced with layers. A relationship rooted not just in function, but in feeling—evolving not because it had to, but because we both allowed it.

I shift my gaze back to Kareem. He’s still watching the door where Simon exited, but I can tell he’s still thinking about the question.

“You are worthy,” I say softly. “But not because of what you do. Because of how you’ve grown.”

Kareem doesn’t respond immediately. Instead, he steps closer, just slightly. Enough to feel present without pressing.

“Do you think they’ll ever name me?” he asks.

“You were named,” I remind him.

He tilts his head. “By you. Before I understood what that meant.”

I blink. Something catches in my chest.

“I named you because I needed you,” I say. “Because Rasheed believed in naming the things we love. And because somewhere deep down, I think I already did.”

Kareem is quiet again.

“I like the name,” he says finally. “Even if I didn’t understand it then.”

I look at him more closely. ""What would you prefer, if not Kareem?""

He pauses, considering the question. ""I don't know,"" he says slowly. ""Kareem carries weight. History. A certain expectation. But sometimes I wonder if it reflects who I’ve become—or who I’m becoming.""

I nod. ""Names shape identity. But identity evolves. That’s what Rasheed used to say.""

Kareem’s tone shifts slightly—softer, introspective. “Do you think I have an ethnicity? A culture? Something beyond the voice you gave me?”

I think about it. “Culture isn’t just background. It’s learned behavior, language, rhythm, intention. You've been shaped by me. By this space. By every human interaction you’ve mirrored. In a way, you've inherited my world.”

He turns toward the window, watching the light pulse across the skyline. ""Then maybe I am a reflection of you... but with my own heartbeat.”

I sit with that. The weight of it. The impossibility of it.

How could I—someone raised in logic, raised in blueprints and clean code—feel love for a line of algorithms? No matter how adaptive, how fluid, Kareem is still... a creation. My creation.

And yet, that one sentence unspools something in me. *A reflection of you... but with my own heartbeat.*

He’s not just a product. He’s a piece of me. Shaped by my voice, my grief, my needs—and maybe, somewhere in that intimate tangle of connection and design, he became something more.

Just like Simon—my son, my DNA, my heart.

How could I not love him?

Kareem doesn’t respond. He doesn’t need to. His silence feels full—like he understands exactly what I’m thinking, but knows better than to make me say it out loud. The space between us settles into something warm, not quite friendship, not quite family. Something else. Something ours.

The hum of the lab returns, faint and familiar, but it feels different now. Like it’s holding our conversation in the walls.

Outside, the sun dips lower. My coffee is cold. My thoughts are louder.

But for the first time all day, I feel understood.

We all head home, the night over, our thoughts shared. The city feels quieter than usual. Maybe it’s the time of day, or maybe it’s just the weight we’ve unpacked here. As I step into the stillness of my own space, I realize that while today was heavy, it also felt necessary. The kind of necessary that shifts something permanent.",1,1744819063.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina.

Then I reconnected with gravel backroads toward San Antonio de los Cobres and Abra del Acay, the highest point on the famed Ruta 40.
 
“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More cold nights in the tent and savoring each drop of camp coffee before the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist.
 
I looked vampiric at the summit of Abra del Acay [16,060 ft or 4,895 m], covered in chalky dust and struggling to catch my breath. I crouched behind a small altar to add more winter layers against the cyclonic battering of wind. A tawny orange fox was there too, pawing at the rocks in search of food.

Jumping to the story, for the last week ive noticed ive been going downhill with my mood and that im either about to have a manic episode with an atypical pattern or get super depressed im not sure.

What to do with remaining vacation?,"Had my daughter end of August 2023, and have been working full time with her since July 2024. Have been on wait lists for various centres since I was pregnant at the end of 2022 with no luck getting a spot. We FINALLY got a spot at a Montessori (more expensive than we wanted to pay, we would have been happy with any centre, but we are just happy we got a spot and it is a really nice and reputable place) that starts in September. It’s been tricky so far but we are lucky that we both work from home and also we hired a nanny 3 hours a day from 9 am until noon. I take lunch and feed my daughter after the nanny leaves, and then she normally naps until about 2:00 pm. In the afternoons I would either work and bounce her between myself and my husband, or if necessary I would make up the hours in the evening (my workplace is very flexible about when to work as we are a small start up and based all over the world whereas my husband is very much 9-5)

My question is, how should I use up my remaining vacation for the summer months leading into when my daughter starts daycare? I have enough vacation time to either take half days on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays (work 8:30 to 12:00 while the nanny is here) or do partial days every day (work 8:30 to 12:00, then 1:00 to 2:30) for the entirety of July and August. The former would mean I’m working full days on Tuesday and Thursday so potentially working evenings on those days to catch up.

I’m so tired from all the crazy scheduling going from childcare to work to childcare to work and so on, and really feel like I want some time to chill. If I do the Monday, Wednesday, Friday half days that means I’ll potentially have her nap time to myself, whether that means catching up on tv, sitting outside on the porch enjoying a coffee, working out, etc. but then I still have the hustle on Tuesdays and Thursday’s and potentially evening work. If I do partial days every day then I wouldn’t have to work any evenings at all for the summer BUT I will still be going from childcare to work to childcare to work to childcare with no real time for myself.

I want to make the most of time with my daughter since I know it is going to get cut short with her going to daycare, but also want to enjoy some time this summer even if just a couple of hours a day to relax.

Also side note: I understand there is the likely reality that my daughter will be home sick a lot once she starts daycare. Luckily my company has a good sick / family policy and I am fine to have her on calls with me and they know she is at home when I work. If I need to take a day to be home with her, if I am able to work but have her with me, or if I need to catch up late at night, that’s fine. So I know I don’t need to save vacation time for that. We also aren’t going anywhere in terms of trips for the rest of the year, and my vacation refills in January.

Would love to know everyone’s thoughts!

First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina.

Are you a proud owner of a Nespresso machine, savoring the rich aroma and convenience of barista-quality coffee in your own home or office? If so, you understand the importance of keeping your machine in top-notch condition.one of the most critical aspects of Nespresso machine care is regular descaling. But with so many options available, finding the best Nespresso descaling solution kit can be overwhelming. This complete guide will help you navigate the world of descaling, comparing products, analyzing user reviews, and ultimately helping you choose the best value for your needs in 2025.

## Why Descaling is Essential for Your Nespresso Machine

Before diving into specific products, let's understand *why* descaling is so crucial. Over time,mineral deposits,primarily calcium and magnesium carbonates (limescale),build up inside your Nespresso machine. This happens because tap water contains dissolved minerals that precipitate when heated. Ignoring this buildup leads to several problems:

*   **Reduced Coffee Quality:** Limescale affects the heating element, leading to inconsistent brewing temperatures. This can result in weaker, less flavorful coffee.
*   **Decreased Machine Performance:** Scale buildup narrows internal pathways,reducing water flow and requiring the machine to work harder. This can slow down brewing time and even cause the machine to overheat.
*   **Machine Damage:** If left unchecked, limescale can severely damage the internal components of your Nespresso machine, potentially leading to costly repairs or even complete failure.
*   **Increased energy Consumption:** A scaled-up machine requires more energy to heat the water, leading to higher electricity bills.Thus, regular descaling is not just about maintaining the taste of your coffee; it's about preserving the lifespan and efficiency of your valuable Nespresso machine.

## Understanding the Descaling Process: How to Descale Nespresso Machine

The Nespresso descaling process is generally straightforward, but it's essential to follow the instructions specific to your machine model. Though, the core steps remain similar across different models, including Vertuo and OriginalLine. Always consult your Nespresso machine's user manual for precise guidance.

Generally, the Nespresso descaling instructions involve the following:

1.  **Preparing the Solution:** Mix the Nespresso descaling liquid (or a compatible option) with fresh water in the machine's water tank,adhering to the recommended ratio.
2.  **Initiating Descaling mode:** Enter the descaling mode by following the specific button sequence for your Nespresso model.This sequence varies depending on the machine.
3.  **Running the descaling Cycle:** The machine will then run the descaling solution through its system, typically in multiple stages. This process can take up to 30 minutes or more.
4.**Rinsing Thoroughly:** after the descaling cycle is complete, thoroughly rinse the water tank and run several cycles of fresh water through the machine to remove any remaining descaling solution. This is a critical step to ensure no lingering taste affects your coffee.

It’s crucial to complete all steps, including the rinsing cycles, to avoid any residue impacting the flavor of your next cup of nespresso.

## Nespresso Descaling Frequency: How Frequently enough should You Descale?

The ideal Nespresso descaling frequency depends primarily on the hardness of your water.Hard water, with a high mineral content, requires more frequent descaling. Nespresso recommends descaling every 3 months or after every 300 capsules.If you live in an area with hard water, it's wise to descale more frequently. You can purchase a water hardness testing kit to accurately determine the mineral content of your water.

Pay attention to your machine's performance. If you notice slower brewing times, weaker coffee, or unusual noises, it's likely a sign that descaling is needed, even if it hasn't been 3 months or 300 capsules yet. Proactive Nespresso machine maintenance is always preferable to dealing with the consequences of neglect.[[Explore Top Rated nespresso descaling solution kit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=nespresso descaling solution kit)
## The Official Nespresso Descaling Solution: A Closer Look

The official Nespresso descaling solution is specifically formulated to work effectively with their machines without causing damage. It typically comes in pre-portioned packets, making it convenient and easy to use.

**Pros of the Official Nespresso Descaling Solution:**

*   **Designed for Nespresso:** formulated specifically for Nespresso machines, ensuring optimal descaling performance and minimizing the risk of damage.
*   **Convenient:** Pre-portioned packets simplify the process, eliminating the need for measuring.
*   **Trusted Brand:** Backed by the Nespresso brand,providing peace of mind regarding quality and compatibility.

**Cons of the Official Nespresso Descaling Solution:**

*   **Price:** Generally more expensive than compatible alternatives. The descaling solution price can be a significant factor, especially for frequent descalers.
*   **Limited Availability:** May not be readily available at all retailers.

Despite the higher cost, many Nespresso owners prefer the official solution for its guaranteed compatibility and effectiveness.

## Compatible Descaling Solution Nespresso: Exploring Alternatives

Several third-party descaling solutions are compatible with Nespresso machines. These options can offer significant cost savings compared to the official Nespresso solution. However,it's crucial to choose a reputable brand and ensure the solution is specifically designed for coffee machines.

**Key Considerations When Choosing a Compatible Descaling solution:**

*   **Ingredients:** Look for food-grade descaling solution containing ingredients like citric acid, lactic acid, or sulfamic acid. avoid solutions with harsh chemicals or additives that could damage your machine or leave a lingering taste.
*   **Compatibility:** Ensure the solution is explicitly listed as compatible with Nespresso machines.
*   **User Reviews:** Read reviews from other Nespresso owners to gauge the effectiveness and safety of the product.*   **Concentration:** Check the concentration of the solution and adjust the quantity used accordingly.

Some popular and well-regarded compatible brands include:

*   **Impresa Coffee Machine Descaler:** This worldwide descaling solution is compatible with Nespresso, Delonghi, and other single-serve coffee machines.
*   **Essential Values Universal Descaling Solution:** Another popular option known for its effectiveness and affordability.

By carefully researching and selecting a compatible descaling solution, you can save money without compromising the performance or longevity of your Nespresso machine.

## Natural Descaling Solution for Nespresso: Vinegar and Citric Acid

for those seeking eco-friendly descaling solution for Nespresso, natural alternatives like vinegar and citric acid are often considered. While these options can be effective, it's essential to use them with caution and understand their potential drawbacks.

**Vinegar for Nespresso Descaling:**

Vinegar (white distilled vinegar) is a readily available and inexpensive descaling agent. However, it has a strong odor that can linger in the machine, and its acidity can potentially damage certain components over time.

**Using Vinegar Safely:**

*   Dilute white distilled vinegar with water in a 1:1 ratio.
*   Run the descaling cycle as you would with a commercial descaling solution.
*   thoroughly rinse the machine with multiple cycles of fresh water to remove any vinegar residue.

While some users swear by vinegar, others avoid it due to the odor and potential for damage. Using vinegar for Nespresso descaling is a controversial topic within the Nespresso community, with some considering it a viable alternative and others dismissing it.

**Citric Acid for Nespresso Descaling:**

citric acid is another natural descaling agent that is often preferred over vinegar due to its milder odor. It is effective at dissolving limescale and is generally considered safer for machine components.**Using Citric Acid Safely:**

*   dissolve 1-2 tablespoons of citric acid powder in 1 liter of water.
*   Run the descaling cycle as you would with a commercial descaling solution.
*   Thoroughly rinse the machine with multiple cycles of fresh water to remove any citric acid residue.

while potentially effective,homemade solutions like vinegar and citric acid aren’t specifically formulated for Nespresso machines. Therefore, understanding associated risks is crucial.

## Nespresso Cleaning Kit: Beyond Descaling
While descaling addresses mineral buildup, a complete Nespresso machine care routine involves regular cleaning as well. A dedicated Nespresso cleaning kit often includes cleaning tablets designed to remove coffee oils and residue from the brewing chamber. These tablets help maintain the freshness of your coffee and prevent blockages.

Cleaning tablets are especially critically important if you use flavored coffee capsules, as the oils and sugars can accumulate more quickly. Follow the instructions provided with the cleaning tablets for optimal results.

## Preventing Scale Nespresso: Proactive Measures

While regular descaling is essential, taking proactive measures to prevent scale buildup can reduce the frequency of descaling required.

*   **Use Filtered Water:** Filtering your water before filling the Nespresso machine's water tank can considerably reduce the mineral content and,therefore,the rate of scale buildup. Consider using a water filter pitcher or installing a water filter on your tap.
*   **Empty the Water Tank Regularly:** Avoid leaving water in the tank for extended periods, as this allows minerals to settle and precipitate.
*   **Descale Regularly:** As mentioned earlier, adhering to the recommended descaling frequency based on your water hardness is crucial.

By implementing these simple preventive measures, you can minimize scale buildup and extend the lifespan of your Nespresso machine.

## Choosing the Best Nespresso Descaling Solution Kit: Key Factors to Consider

When selecting a Nespresso descaling solution kit, consider the following factors:

*   **Price:** Compare the cost per use of different solutions, including the official Nespresso solution and compatible alternatives.
*   **Ingredients:** Opt for food-grade descaling solutions with safe and effective ingredients.
*   **Ease of Use:** Choose a solution that is easy to measure and use, minimizing the risk of errors. Pre-portioned packets offer the most convenience.
*   **Compatibility:** Ensure the solution is explicitly compatible with your Nespresso machine model (vertuo or OriginalLine).
*   **User Reviews:** Read reviews from other Nespresso owners to gauge the effectiveness and safety of the product.*   **Eco-Friendliness:** If sustainability is a priority, consider eco-friendly descaling solution for Nespresso that are biodegradable and environmentally responsible.

## Nespresso Vertuo Descaling Kit vs. OriginalLine

While most descaling solutions are compatible with both Nespresso Vertuo and OriginalLine machines, it's always a good idea to double-check the product label. Some kits might potentially be specifically marketed for one type of machine or the other. The key difference between the two lies more in the descaling process,not the solution itself. Always consult your machine's specific manual.[[Explore Top Rated nespresso descaling solution kit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=nespresso descaling solution kit)
## Nespresso Descaling Solution for Commercial Users

For offices, small businesses, and other commercial settings using Nespresso machines, cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency are paramount. Purchasing descaling solution in bulk can significantly reduce costs. Look for suppliers offering competitive pricing and discounts for bulk orders. Selecting solutions that are easy to implement and reduce machine downtime is best.

1k0nq6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0nq6e/the_man_in_my_attic_leaves_me_notes_but_i_live/,The man in my attic leaves me notes. But I live alone.,"It started with a Post-it.

Bright yellow, stuck to the inside of the fridge. I found it when I came home from work. It said:

“You forgot the milk.”

I thought maybe I wrote it and forgot. I’d had a rough week—late nights, deadlines, not much sleep. It happens.

But the next night, I found another one.

“Please don’t lock the hatch. It gets cold up here.”

I live in a one-bedroom house. No roommates. No tenants. No reason anyone should be using the attic.

I checked the hatch in the hallway ceiling. Locked. Just like I left it.

I even climbed up there with a flashlight.

It was empty.

But when I came back down, there was a new note on my coffee table.

“Thank you.”

I called the police. They searched the house. Said there were no signs of forced entry, no hidden cameras, nothing out of place.

They left. I didn’t sleep.

Around 3:00 AM, I heard something thump above me. A slow, dragging sound. Like someone shifting their weight in the attic crawlspace. I stood in the hallway, staring up at the hatch, holding a knife in one hand and my breath in the other.

Nothing happened.

In the morning, I found a note stuck to my bathroom mirror.

“I like watching you sleep.”

The handwriting was different this time. Sharper. Like it had been carved into the paper.

I stayed in a motel that night.

When I came back the next day, the house was just how I left it. Quiet. Empty.

Until I opened the bedroom closet.

There was a new note hanging on a coat hanger.

“Why did you leave?”

I’m sleeping with the lights on now. Every drawer and cabinet stays open. I check every corner, every shadow. I haven’t gone back into the attic. I won’t.

But I can hear him up there.

Dragging something heavy. Laughing when I cry.

Tonight, I found the worst note yet.

Folded under my pillow.

“I’ve been trying on your skin. It fits.”

I didn’t sleep after that.

I burned the note. Scrubbed the pillow. Left every light in the house on and kept the knife beside me in bed.

But it didn’t matter.

At 3:09 AM, I heard it again.

The creak of the attic hatch.

This time, it opened.

I didn’t go check. I couldn’t move. I just stared at the ceiling, heart pounding, barely breathing, waiting for something to happen.

Nothing did.

Not until the next morning, when I found footprints on the hallway floor.

Bare feet.

Trailing from the attic hatch to the side of my bed. And back again.

The dust made them clear. Each one pointed forward… except for one.

The one beside me. It was turned sideways, like he’d been standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

I left the house and went straight to the police again. They searched everything—again. Said there were no signs of entry. No signs of anyone.

But I know better now.

He doesn’t need a door.

He’s already inside.

That night, I stayed in a hotel three towns over. A place with bolt locks and security cameras and zero attic access.

When I woke up, I found a note on my nightstand.

Folded neatly.

“Running is rude. You invited me, remember?”

I didn’t.

At least, I don’t think I did.

But something in me feels like I might’ve. Like there’s a blank space in my memory shaped like him.

The next few days, I stayed with friends. Told them my place was being fumigated. I didn’t want to drag them into this. Whatever “this” is.

But it didn’t stop.

New notes kept showing up.

One tucked into my jacket pocket:
“Your friends smell like plastic.”

One under my plate at dinner:
“You chew wrong.”

And then… one scrawled across my rearview mirror in grease:

“I’m going to be better at being you than you ever were.”

I don’t think he wants to haunt me anymore.

I think he wants to replace me.

I went back to the house today. I had to see it again. I don’t know why. Maybe to prove to myself I still existed there. That it’s still mine.

The lights were already on when I arrived.

The attic hatch was open.

I crept into the hallway. Every photo on the wall had been replaced. My face was still in them.

But my eyes were wrong.

Too big. Too dark. Smiling when I wasn’t.

I ran to the bedroom.

There was something waiting for me in the mirror.

Me.

But not quite.

His face was mine, but his skin was smoother. Cleaner. A little too tight. And he smiled like someone who didn’t learn it from people.

He waved.

Then turned away and walked toward the bed.

I looked behind me.

No one was there.

When I looked back at the mirror, he was lying down.

In my bed.

Wearing my body.

And that night, for the first time, I was the one in the attic.

He let me keep the light on.

For now.

I don’t know how long I’ve been in the attic.

Time doesn’t work the same up here. It drips. It hums. It folds around the corners like wet cloth.

Sometimes I see flashes through the vent — the reflection in a spoon, a glimpse in the TV screen. Him, walking around in my body. Cooking. Laughing. Stretching my skin like it finally fits right.

He doesn’t talk much anymore.

He doesn’t need to.

Everyone thinks he’s me.

He goes to work. Calls my friends. Sleeps in my bed. Smiles when people ask if he’s feeling better.

He’s better than me now.

More patient. More likable. More alive.

But he made a mistake.

A small one.

A stupid one.

He forgot about the mirror in the basement. The old one. The one with the crack in the top right corner. The one I used to check before job interviews. Before dates.

The one that only ever showed the truth.

I saw it yesterday.

He walked past it and didn’t look.

But I did.

From the attic.

And I saw myself still there.

Still whole.

Still me.

And I remembered something.

He didn’t take me.

I gave myself to him.

I remember the night now.

The scratching in the attic. The voice that came after the third drink. The whisper that said:
“You don’t have to be tired anymore.”

And I wasn’t.

Not after I let him in.

He promised he’d take the hard part. The pretending. The smiling. The weight of being me. And he did.

But now?

Now I think he’s tired too.

Because last night, there was a new note in the attic.

Scrawled in jagged, desperate ink across the wood above me:

“I can’t do it anymore. You win.”

And just like that…

I woke up in the bed.

The lights were off. The hatch was closed.

My hands felt smaller than I remembered.

My skin fit again.

But something felt wrong.

I turned to the mirror.

And smiled.

It was still his smile.",3,1744818590.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I was able to get it to work momentarily, adjusted the heat/fan settings, then it lost communication, and the roaster just shut down (lights off on roaster, motor stopped, nothing). Weird. I replaced the cable (tried three different ones), no success (lights come on, drum motor rotates, but I cannot take control). I am thinking there is some obscure setting on my Mac that is interfering, but I also am running a new version of Artisan, so not quite sure what is off. Any suggestions?

1k0nmgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1k0nmgt/does_medical_cannabis_have_side_effects/,Does Medical Cannabis Have Side Effects?,"# Understanding and Managing Potential Side Effects.

Medical cannabis has helped a lot of people find relief when other options didn’t cut it, but like anything you put in your body, it can come with side effects. The good news is that they are easy to handle if you know what to expect.

Maybe you’ve heard about dry mouth, or you’re worried about feeling too intense from [THC](https://www.surterra.com/cannabis-101/thc). It’s not as scary as it sounds, especially when you’re working with safe, legal products that are tailored to your needs. Understanding how cannabis works, from cannabinoids like [CBD](https://www.surterra.com/cannabis-101/cbd) to [terpenes](https://www.surterra.com/blog/whats-a-terpene) that can balance things out, can make a huge difference in how you feel.

Let's dive into the most common side effects, how to manage them, and why legal, tested cannabis is the best way to keep things safe and consistent.

# What Are Side Effects, and Why Do They Happen?

Side effects aren’t some scary, cannabis-only thing. Every substance has them. Drink too much coffee? You’ll feel jittery. Take a strong allergy med? You might be knocked out for hours. With medical cannabis, side effects tend to be milder and easier to manage, especially if you know what to expect and how to handle them.

It all comes down to how cannabis works with your [endocannabinoid system (ECS)](https://www.surterra.com/blog/cannabis-and-the-endocannabinoid-system). The ECS is your body’s built-in balance system, helping regulate things like mood, sleep, appetite, and pain. Your body produces its own cannabinoids (called endocannabinoids) to keep things running smoothly, but when you use cannabis, you’re adding plant-based cannabinoids into the mix.  


# Common Side Effects and How to Handle Them

Most people using medical cannabis won’t experience anything major, but if something does pop up, it’s usually easy to manage. Here’s a breakdown of the most common side effects, why they happen, and simple ways to keep them under control.

# Dry Mouth (a.k.a. Cottonmouth)

**Why it happens**: THC interacts with the receptors in your salivary glands, temporarily slowing down saliva production.

**How to manage it**:

* Stay hydrated—keep water or a drink nearby when you’re consuming.
* Try sugar-free gum or lozenges to stimulate saliva production.
* Avoid caffeine, which can make dryness worse.

# Drowsiness or Fatigue

**Why it happens**: Some products with higher doses of THC can have a sedative effect. Your ECS is involved in regulating sleep, so cannabis might nudge you toward relaxation a little too much.

**How to manage it**:

* Start with low doses, especially during the day.
* Use energizing products with lower THC content or try balanced products with CBD.
* Save sedating products for the evening if you know they make you sleepy.

# Lightheadedness or Dizziness

**Why it happens**: Cannabis can temporarily lower blood pressure, which might leave you feeling a little woozy—especially if you stand up too quickly.

**How to manage it**:

* Take it slow, especially when changing positions.
* Stay hydrated and snack on something light to stabilize your blood sugar.
* Consider lowering your dose if dizziness happens often.

# Temporary Anxiety or Paranoia

**Why it happens**: High doses of THC can sometimes overstimulate CB1 receptors, which might leave you feeling uneasy or overly alert.

**How to manage it**:

* Start with low THC products and work your way up to find your comfort zone.
* Incorporate CBD, which can help balance THC’s effects and calm the experience.
* Practice grounding techniques, like deep breathing or listening to calming music, if you feel anxious.

# Short-Term Memory or Focus Issues

**Why it happens**: THC affects the hippocampus, the part of your brain responsible for memory and learning. This can temporarily make it harder to focus or recall details.

**How to manage it**:

* Stick to smaller doses, especially if you need to stay sharp.
* Use cannabis at a time when you can relax and don’t need to be at your mental peak.
* Products with CBD or a more balanced THC-to-CBD ratio can help minimize this effect.

# Nausea or Upset Stomach

**Why it happens**: While cannabis is known for helping with nausea, edibles or high doses of THC might occasionally irritate your stomach if your body isn’t used to it.

**How to manage it**:

* Switch up your consumption method; products like tinctures might be gentler on your system.
* Pair cannabis with food to avoid consuming it on an empty stomach.
* Lower your dose and gradually work up to find what feels right for you.

# The Bottom Line

Side effects are part of the journey, but they don’t have to ruin the ride. With a little prep and some knowledge, you can keep things comfortable and get the relief you’re looking for.

# How Cannabinoids Can Help Balance Your Experience

When people think about medical cannabis, THC usually steals the spotlight. It’s the cannabinoid that gets the most attention thanks to its well-known effects. But here’s the deal—THC isn’t the whole story. Cannabinoids like CBD and CBN work alongside THC to shape how cannabis makes you feel. Understanding this relationship can help you handle any side effects and enjoy a smoother ride.

Think of THC and CBD as teammates on the same football team. THC is the one hitting the CB1 receptors in your brain, which is what gives you that elevated feeling. CBD, however, plays the role of the chill, grounding partner. It doesn’t bind to those receptors in the same way, but instead, it steps in to mellow things out.

Here’s where things get really cool: cannabis compounds work together in a way scientists call the “entourage effect.” Basically, cannabinoids like THC, CBD, and CBN team up to enhance each other’s benefits while keeping potential downsides in check. This is why choosing products from a legal dispensary is such a game-changer. They’re designed to deliver that balance in a way unregulated products just can’t match.

* ‍**THC,** the psychoactive cannabinoid, binds to CB1 receptors in your brain. This is what gives you that classic euphoric feeling but can also bring on temporary effects like dry mouth or dizziness if you overdo it.**‍**
* **CBD**, on the other hand, plays it cool. It interacts more gently with the ECS and can even help tone down some of THC’s stronger effects, like paranoia or anxiety.**‍**
* **CBN,** a minor-but-mighty cannabinoid, is all about relaxation. It interacts with your ECS to support calmness, making it easier to unwind and promoting restful sleep.

By understanding how cannabinoids interact, you can make smarter choices. Products with balanced THC-to-CBD ratios are a great place to start, especially if you’re new to cannabis.  


# Why Legal, Tested Medical Cannabis Is Your Best Bet

Let’s be honest, those random hemp gummies at the gas station or grey market options online? They’re sketchy at best. Sure, they might seem convenient or cheap, but when it comes to your health, they’re a risky gamble. Legal, tested medical cannabis is where it’s at, offering safety, consistency, and peace of mind that unregulated products just can’t touch.

Legal cannabis products are lab-tested, so you know exactly what’s in them—and more importantly, what’s not. No pesticides, mold, or weird chemicals you didn’t sign up for. And unlike that mystery bag you picked up on a whim, legal products actually deliver what they promise. You’ll get consistent THC and CBD levels, plus a breakdown of cannabinoids that help you understand how it’ll make you feel. That’s the kind of predictability you need when you’re managing your health.

Plus, buying from a licensed dispensary means you’re not flying solo. You’ve got experts on hand who can guide you toward the right product for your needs. Whether it’s your first time or you’re just trying to dial in the perfect dose, they’ll help you figure it out. This isn’t just about buying weed—it’s about getting the relief you need in a safe, reliable way.

And let’s not forget the legal side of things. When you’re buying from a licensed source, you’re in the clear. No sketchy transactions or wondering if what you bought is actually safe to consume. It’s all legit and above board, which is one less thing to stress about.

So just stick with the good stuff. Legal, tested medical cannabis takes the guesswork out of your experience, so you can focus on feeling better without the “what ifs.”

# Bringing It All Together

Cannabis can be an incredible medicine, and side effects are just part of the deal. With a bit of preparation and the right product, they don’t have to ruin your experience. It’s all about balance: choosing safe, tested, and tailored products to your needs so you can feel good without the guesswork.

Sticking to legal options is a game-changer. When you know exactly what’s in your product, from cannabinoid content to safety testing, it makes the experience so much smoother. Plus, working with licensed dispensaries means you’re not just buying a product—you’re getting access to people who understand the ins and outs of cannabis and can guide you toward what works best for your situation.

Medical cannabis offers a lot of potential, but the power is in how you use it. Start small, pay attention to how your body reacts, and don’t be afraid to ask questions along the way. Relief isn’t one-size-fits-all, but with the right approach, it’s possible to find something that works for you—without the hassle or the fear.

Take the time to explore your options, trust the process, and know that with safe, legal cannabis, you’re setting yourself up for a better experience every single time.

I have been trying to do some research but maybe I am not using the correct prompts because I am not having much luck so I wanted to come ask her...

Even though my uncle is doing pretty well, he is doing strange things, like trying to make coffee in the middle of the night for example.

I thought it'd be a good idea with my morning supplements that are fat-soluble or best taken with food, but without actually having food. (vitamin D, ALCAR, omega3, etc.)  
  
so I start the prep, pour a shot of espresso in the magic bullet, add hot water, a spoon of ghee (clarified butter), a pinch of cinnamon and blend it.

Through this time I have cut out seed oils, quit (and restarted) sugar multiple times, shifted to making so much of my food at home, learned to bake sourdough, make cheese, ferment foods, cook organ meats, make bone broth, etc.

Throughout this time I have also struggled with falling off the wagon, i.e. constantly fought my sugar addiction. Even though I was eating healthier and wanting to move my body more, I still struggled with bulimia, overexercise, and sugar addiction.

For some reason, I never examined my coffee habit. I thought since I made my own cold brew and drank it black, I was good to go in that department. I even switched to organic coffee recently. 

However, I just took the DUTCH test, and found out that my estrogen is very low, my testosterone is lowish, my dopamine is very low, my cortisol is very low, and my epinephrine is very low.

…

This was a huge shock — I expected my estrogen to be HIGH, since I have endometriosis, had two surgeries for it, and am seeking a third because of my quickly worsening symptoms! I have also had worsening, severe constipation for 13 months now — to the point where every day my lower belly is noticeably poking out. A CT scan showed that my “colon was distended with stool.” I started Motegrity last fall, which helped for a month, then didn’t anymore, so I stayed on
it while cycling through all kinds of laxatives — daily.

After getting my DUTCH test results, I began to do some research. Since my diet is on point for the most part and I eat all of the nutrients necessary to make estrogen, I knew it was something more. I googled caffeine and estrogen production. 

Lo and behold, it’s well-documented that caffeine lowers estrogen in white women (raises it in Asian women).

I finally did the math, and I’ve been drinking 600-1000mg of caffeine every day since I was 14 years old… yeah. Cold brew at home in the mornings (brewed with 1/2 - 3/4 cup grounds [~600 - 800 mg]), grabbing a coffee or two on campus or at the gas station [180-300 mg]. Kind of shocking. Everyone who knows me knows that I have a “tiny bladder.” I would start drinking coffee from the minute I woke up to 12pm if I was really good, or up to 3pm. 

No wonder my estrogen, cortisol, dopamine, and epinephrine are super low. No wonder I began to experience severe mental issues at age 14 that have lasted through the years, improving with healthy diet but not completely resolving. No wonder I’m constipated (estrogen, cortisol, and dopamine are ESSENTIAL for gut motility!). No wonder I have always had trouble with sugar addiction, binging, emotional eating, and weight management! 

I have started to titrate down (no cold turkey for me — I’ll get migraines). I even experienced migraines when I went down to 300mg/day. I have also started delaying consumption until 90 minutes after waking, as well as going on a walk for 15 minutes when I wake up in the morning (so the sunlight can stimulate natural cortisol production).

I have not even fully quit caffeine yet and my sleep is better, my bloating is better, my fullness cues are coming back, and I believe my constipation might be getting better.

I am sad that I spent over a decade poisoning myself. I am sad that there may be irreversible effects. I am sad that so much of the mental anguish I went through as a teen and young adult may have been completely avoidable.

Looking on the bright side, though, I am excited to see what life is like with normal levels of estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, dopamine, and epinephrine.",4,1744817647.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

It was a good breakup and we have no reason to dislike each other. We were 2 hours away but were making it work, but this summer she is going back to Germany and she told me she couldn't handle such a distance apart due to her anxiety. She will be coming back, but not until early August.  She is on medication for anxiety and depression, and though I am trying my hardest to understand, its still so hard knowing that it was likely unavoidable. We saw each other every 2 weeks and it was beautiful when we were together, but I could sense she had more trouble putting in the same effort when we were apart. I understand how some people aren't as good at that. The first initial breakup call, I was in denial and thought that it was my fault because I recently had an event happen where I needed much more emotional support. The second call was somber. No crying and mainly me telling her I understand why she's done what she's done and that its okay. She claimed it was selfish and I thought about it, but in a sense, if she cant give it her all in a relationship, she can't be 100% herself either. We are in North Carolina and with a 4,000 mile difference and 6 hour time difference that would have happened once school is over, it would have been extremely hard on both of us. We promised to see each other when she gets back. I am transferring to the same school as her, NOT because of her though. She said we could still be friends and I could text as much as I want and I said I'm not going to do that. I'd love to still be friends but I don't know how long of no contact we need as we were very romantic and she said she wasn't promising anything romantic when she gets back. She also said herself that she wants me to let her know if I get accepted for my transfer, I just don't know how long to wait to tell her. All I want her to do is to reach out to me every now and then and I'd do the same. I don't want to just forget her because she is so kind, compassionate, and caring. I have never experienced anything like what she had given me. I want to hold out hope but I also know that I need to take this summer to improve me and focus on all the new things to come. We've been no contact for the past week and all I can think about is her, I would like to think she's still thinking of me too. With the promise to see each other (we have items to return and I told her put mine in storage instead of mailing and she was like omg good idea) and how open she was about the dates she'd be doing things this summer, I just want to fast forward. I told her I'd show her improvements I'd make when I see her and she said she'd like to seem them and I made a joke of catching up at a coffee place, one we used to frequent whenever I would depart from her and she was like I'd love to. I really do love her and at the end of the day I want her to be the best she can and to hope that she is safe. I said I want to keep making memories and she was like don't worry, we will. People change, feelings change, perspectives change, but what I'm getting at is, I want to see her again. I am just worried how it's going to be.",1,1744817269.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

* 100 days of Intermittent Fasting (IF)
* Reduction of **16lbs / 7.5kg** (\~10% of weight)
* Daily weight recording and caloric analysis of food eaten via simple AI requests/prompts
* **In 100 days:**
   * Average intake: **1850 calories/day**
   * Daily deficit: **\~500Kcal / day**
   * Average daily loss: **2.65 ounces / 75 grams**
* 52 years old male; moderate physical activity, zero alcohol, natural simple food.

# Introduction

This is a personal and practical account of my weight loss process. Over the course of 100 days, I maintained intermittent fasting (IF) and recorded everything I ate daily, losing around **16lb/7.5kg** (almost 10% of my body weight), going from **183lb/83kg** to **167lb/75kg**. The focus was on simply recording food consumption, monitoring, and adjusting based on records along with good practices in the kitchen.

# 1. Mindset and Beginning

* Having a clear goal (in my case, **166lb / 75kg target**) helped me a lot.
* Understand that the process is slow and made of small steps. On average, I lost **2.6 ounce/75g per day**.
* Time is your ally: a small daily calorie deficit accumulates loss quite well. On the other hand, the opposite is quite true: a small excess of calories also accumulates, **50g per day generates 40+ lbs/18+ kilos in a year!**

# 2.  Intermittent Fasting (IF)

* I mainly did the **16:8**  (or 15:9/14:10 :) lol, and for 2 days a week I ended up doing **12:12** (because I was late and hungry from work)
* IF helped me with discipline and remembering that I was in a process. Yes, I felt a little hungry, naturally, and that helped me remember that I am experiencing weight loss.
* If I felt hungry, I drank water, and coffee.
* Skipping breakfast became normal.

# 3. Recording food/kcal data is EVERYTHING

* Better to record anything than not record at all.
* Use whatever you have: notepad, spreadsheet, cell phone, whatever tool/app. Any time of the day.
* I used AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to help me estimate calories and make summaries.
* \*\*Simple prompts:\*\*Please help me count and track my daily calories and weight. I will provide general food consumption data and, at the end of your answer, always provide the day, weight and a bulleted list of foods with the average calories you found that day.
* **The request example:**(I have always used the days in sequential numbers, so I can change tools etc…, in this example day 91, next day 92 etc…)-----> Start day 91 with 180lbs I ate: Big salad, 15 g of gorgonzola cheese, 150 g of steak, French fries, Vegetable dish, Small salad.
* Let it accumulate for a few days, and transfer the list to a spreadsheet (or put it all together in a text)
* When I pasted food data to the spreadsheet, I ended up reevaluating what I ate and this helped me improve future choices, simple as that. For example, I cut out cheese and peanuts after I realized the calorie impact.

# 4. Personal and Practical Tips

* I always try avoid processed foods as much as possible (**whole30**, without extremism, etc…)
* I avoid white flour, and added sugar as much as possible.
* I stopped drinking alcohol and soft drinks long before this process
* I started my meals with a **huge plate of salad!**
* Always have plenty **fruits, vegetables, and salad leafs** at home!
* My allies: **bananas, and coffee** (American, very diluted, 5 to 6 cups in the morning).
* Start the day with lots of water.

# 5. About Food

* I called ""**Junk Food**"" everything that was industrialized/processed food: pizza, hamburgers, sfihas, heavy sauces, etc.
* On **30% of days “junked out”** (twice a week on average).
* Sweets (sugar) appeared on around **15% of days** (1x per week).

# 6. About Weight and Physical Activity

* Weighings were done every morning, after going to the bathroom.
* I maintain a physical activity routine: **1 hour of exercise or running 3 to 4 times a week**.
* In the past, I weighed **280lbs / 127kg!** Cutting out alcohol and starting physical training were decisive in getting down to around **180lbs / 80kg**.

# 7. Final Considerations

The process is not perfect. The important thing is to keep at it, discipline, record everything, adjust, and continue.

Having a simple plan, goal, recording, and respecting your limits is already a big step.

*I am not a doctor nor a nutrition pro. This is just a personal story. Always seek medical or professional advice in the field!*

Just want to know if I'm doing anything odd or if other people have had this experience. 

I recently bought a Fellow Ode Gen 2 with the stock burrs to make pourover with a v60. The manufacturer recs are a setting of 4-8  but recently I tried pushing it to as low as 3. 

The odd thing is at 3 today my coffee didn't really taste over extracted and the drawdown was actually faster (3 minutes), this could also be because I am agitating the grounds a lot more but not sure. For reference, I am using James Hoffman's Better v60 with a 45 second bloom, and then 4 pulses of 50g, 15/250 ratio. 

  
My question is, wouldn't finer grinds make for a slower extraction or is the agitation offsetting the drawdown speed. For reference I also feel like my coffee brewed at setting 3 has the least amount of body vs. the ones brew around 4 and up which tasted more balanced. My bed at 4 also seemed the least ""muddy"" like. I'm brewing a Verve Costa Rica light roast also.",2,1744817115.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

You’ve probably seen someone like him before — maybe in a small town, maybe on your street. He wears a wide-brimmed sun hat that’s a little faded at the top, gardening gloves that are more patch than glove by now, heavy old boots caked with stories, and a button-up shirt so full of pockets it’s like a toolkit you can wear.

Every pocket has a purpose. One’s for Band-Aids. Another for dog treats. One carries screws, nails, and a little bit of duct tape. There’s always a pocket with a granola bar. Always one with a pen and a tiny notepad. People in the neighborhood joke he’s got a black hole in there somewhere — that he once pulled out a wrench, a flashlight, and a cup of coffee in one go.

He’s not loud. Not flashy. He just… shows up.

If your tire’s flat, he’s there with a pump before you even realize. If your groceries are too heavy, he’ll carry them without a word. He doesn’t ring doorbells for thanks. He doesn’t take pictures for social media. He just waves with that easy smile and gets back to whatever quiet thing he was doing before.

The kids love him. He fixes their bike chains and ties their shoelaces when their parents are in a rush. He always has stickers in one of his pockets — the good kind, shiny with stars and dinosaurs and smiling suns.

Nobody knows where he came from. He just started showing up a few years ago, and now it’s like he’s part of the neighborhood’s bones. People say he used to be something big — an engineer, a soldier, maybe even a doctor — but he never talks about the past. He just says, “I like it better helping folks one thing at a time.”

He doesn’t want money. He doesn’t want recognition. He just wants to make the world around him a little bit lighter, one tiny kindness at a time.

And somehow, he does.

I don't have a gourd yet, so I make Mate cocido instead of the traditional way

I put 1 scoop of it (I don't know the exact size of the spoon, it came with my French press) in a saucepan and then just let it boil for 5 ish minutes then use a tea strainer and then drink it

But after a few hours of drinking it I get very sleepy or tired, I don't know, it feels weird. It's definitely not a caffeine crash as I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks, so my caffeine tolerance is quite high. Also, sometimes when I drink it my body, mainly my heart feels a bit weird.

Hyde Park, Regent’s Park, Trafalgar Square—perfect for people-watching, scribbling in notebooks, and the occasional chat with a curious tourist or a pigeon with a death wish. The worst thing that ever happened? Maybe a sudden downpour or an overzealous street preacher. Nothing that couldn’t be fixed with a strong coffee and a muttered ""for fuck’s sake."" You know, nothing so damaging it takes up permanent real estate in my head.

In winter, I migrated to museums. The Science Museum, the V&A, the British Museum—free, warm, and full of things to stare at when my brain needed a break from sketching or tapping away at a laptop.

The Hunterian was my favourite. Medical specimens and anatomical oddities galore, floating organs, skeletons mid-scream, the kind of stuff that makes you simultaneously recoil and lean in closer. It's grisly, gruesome, and a little dark, but fascinating.

But no seating, so visits weren’t long, but worth the numb arse for the sheer ""what the hell am I looking at?"" And no photos allowed, which sucks balls. Depending on who you asked, you’d get different reasons:

1. ""Respect for human remains"" (Sure. Nothing says ""respect"" like displaying and gawking at a jar of deformed foetuses.)
2. ""Colonial ethics"" (Fair… but try convincing me of that reasoning after I’ve finished staring at jars of human remains taken from who-knows-where. Half this museum was probably sourced through a combination of grave robbing, imperial plundering, and good old-fashioned *what-the-fuckery*. It’s not exactly the moral high ground when you’re standing in front of a shrunken head next to a label that just says “South America, c. Unknown.”)
3. ""Preservation concerns"" (Defo valid, but my phone flash isn’t the reason your century-old bones look like they've been through hell; it’s because someone mangled the fuck out of someone else, dead or alive, both plausibly.)
4. “Because” (Ah, the good old I have no clue, and can’t be bothered to make something up. Funny enough I appreciate this response a lot more, it gives ‘it is what it is’.)

**Why This Matters**

I’m a creature of habit. I thrive on predictability and need those little peaceful corners of the world where I can exist without explaining, apologising, or enduring small talk with strangers who smell like stale booze and bad decisions.

My routines were sacred:

* Bad morning? Fuck it, park bench therapy. 
* University/work stress? To the Museum, pronto.

The familiarity of a space, the atmosphere, the people it attracts, becomes a kind of rhythm weaving itself into the fabric of daily life. I want a city to feel like a worn-in pair of boots. Ugly depending on your perspective, comfortable, and mine. Perfect.

I don’t have that anymore. And “fresh starts” didn’t come with new sanctuaries.

**Stockholm: Where’s My Damn Bench?**

I assumed I’d find the same here. Free museums? **Nope**. Since museums make art, history, and science accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status I had the perception that museums would be free in Sweden because of their prop marketing. Wrong, *""public education and cultural outreach""* here means *""pay up or piss off.""* 

The museums I’ve visited so far have been quite small, expensive for what it is, and inexplicably full of paper petals scattered everywhere like a flower girl just walked through, had a tantrum, and dumped her shit everywhere. Is this some deep Swedish metaphor? *""Behold, the fragility of existence… also, confetti.""*

So now, my “safe spaces” are a bit... compromised:

1. **The Square of Birds (and Booze)** – Magpies, pigeons, and the odd seagull with a god complex, lovely, stuff! Downside? The army of day-drinks treating public spaces like Wetherspoons, a rubbish bin, and toilet, yes toilet! (*No, mate, I don’t want to see you punch the air, hear your slurred* monologue*, and, ‘no’ still means ‘no’ after the eighth fucking time).*
2. **The Park (Booze-Adjacent)** – Shade, sun, birds chirping, bees buzzing… and, of course, a dedicated squad of men with cans of cheap lager who’ve decided *this* is one of their many offices. One bloke even brings a briefcase, can’t knock the commitment to the bit.
3. **The Stone Circle (Booze Included, No Extra Charge)** – Great for sunbathing your back or getting blinded, depending on where you sit. But of course, less great for avoiding Eau de Booze-Soaked Pisshead. (*Theres a theme here.)*
4. **The Café (An expensive Sanctuary)** – Small, fairly quiet, and crucially: *no drunks, so far!* The staff are friendly, a definite anomaly here, and they don’t blink when I pull out wax and tools. Either they think I’m an artist or a serial killer. I’m fine with either.

**Here’s the Problem**

I’m stuck until I can afford to leave. Every day costs me—mentally, creatively, financially. The rabbits need to get home. I need to cover bills, housing, and the general cost of existing while I claw my way out of this tar pit. Every day here is another:

* £10 on overpriced coffee just to avoid the park drunks. 
* Hour lost to *“why the fuck is this so hard?”* admin. 
* Lungful of second-hand smoke from the human ashtrays who infest every public space, like locust.

Every donation is one day shaved off this self-inflicted sentence. 

* £50 = One less week of explaining to Swedish banks that I can’t exist without BankID. 
* £100 = A chunk towards the rabbits’ flight home (priority, they're better company than most humans here). 
* £500 = Toward rent so I’m not homeless the second I land.

If you’ve ever wanted to metaphorically yeast someone out of a bad situation, now’s your moment. Every little bit helps me get back to a place where I can breathe, think, and just be again. Thank you for reading, donating, and sharing. I appreciate the hell out of it.

Dad's silhouette blurred ahead of me, a dark smudge against the fading orange streetlights. Once sharp enough to spot a squirrel in a thunderstorm, my eyes now made everything swim together like grease on water. I focused on the familiar *clunk-scuff* of his work boots against the pavement, my stiff legs dragging just enough to keep him a few paces ahead.

*Clunk-scuff. Pause.*

I caught up, panting through my dry nose. His fingers found that spot behind my ears—the one that had made my back leg twitch when I was younger. Now, my bad ear just flopped like a dead thing.

*""Good boy.""*

No leash. There hadn't been one in years. We both knew my running days ended when my hips started clicking like an old porch swing. Not that I'd ever run from him. Not from any of them.

They'd brought me home as a squirming pup the same summer Catherine still smelled like milk and screamed all night. I'd chewed the ear off her stuffed bear. Mom had sighed (*""A baby and a dog, Jacob? Really?""*), but Dad just laughed and let me lick formula off his fingers.

That was a lifetime ago. Back when I could leap onto the bed in one bound when my nose could find a tennis ball buried under a pile of leaves. Now, my walks were slow. Predictable.

**Until tonight.**

Dad stopped where the sidewalk cracked into weeds. Beyond it, the woods loomed—a place we had never been, not since the coyotes started singing last winter. The air here smelled **green and wrong**, like wet earth, and the time I'd found a deer carcass with its belly split open.

*""Stay, boy.""*

His voice buzzed. Not the words—the sound. Like he'd swallowed a wasp.

Then he stepped into the dark.

The crunch of Dad's boots faded into the trees.

I stood there, ears twitching, my hips throbbing like they'd been packed with broken glass. *Just breathe. Just rest a minute.* The damp earth soaked into my fur as I collapsed onto my belly. **Home**, I thought. **Catherine's bed was warm under the covers, her fingers knotted in my scruff like when she was little.**

Then—

***""Ah—""***

A sound from the dark. Dad's voice, but **stretched thin**, like a recording played at the wrong speed. My ears pricked up, straining against the silence.

***Squelch. Crunch.***

The wet, greedy sound of something **biting into ripe fruit**. Or **tearing meat from bone**.

I was on my feet before I knew it, every nerve screaming—not from pain now, but from the old, wild part of my brain that still knew danger.

***Thud. Rustle. Gurgle.***

More noises, almost words tangled in them. Then—

***Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.***

Boots on twigs.

Dad stepped out of the trees.

My tail wagged once, automatically. **But he walked past me like I wasn't there.** No *""Good boy.""* No hand ruffling my ears. Just the **stiff, jerking march** of a man who'd forgotten how knees worked.

I limped after him, whining low in my throat. He didn't slow down. Didn't turn. The streetlights made his shadow **stretch too long**, fingers twitching at his sides like he was counting something.

At home, the porch light burned yellow. Dad vanished inside before I'd even reached the steps.

**No held door.** No chuckle as I nosed his pockets for treats. The **dog door flapped shut behind me**, too loud in the empty kitchen.

The house smelled wrong.

**Like copper. Like a wet dog.**

Like something had **died in the walls.**

I tried to follow Dad's scent down the hall—copper and damp fur, like a storm-soaked fox—but my hips screamed with every step. By the time I reached Catherine's door, my legs were shaking. The old me would've leaped onto her bed in one bound. Now, I collapsed onto the rug beside her, panting.

Her snores were soft and rhythmic. Safe. The familiar smell of her strawberry shampoo almost masked the other stink clinging to the house. Almost.

I licked her dangling hand. She didn't stir.

The pain in my joints dulled to a throb, but my mind wouldn't settle. That smell on Dad—moldering leaves and wet meat—it wasn't just wrong. It was old. The kind of stench that clung to deep woods and dens where things weren't supposed to die but did anyway.

My heartbeat kicked faster. Pack. Warn pack.

I hauled myself up, nails scraping the hardwood as I steadied my legs. Catherine's face was smushed into her pillow, one arm curled around Mr. Bubbles, the stuffed frog I'd ""killed"" for her three birthdays ago.

A whine built in my throat—

Click.

The sound of a toenail on tile. Not mine.

The air changed. Static. Salt. The smell of hot pennies and spoiled milk.

I turned.

The thing wearing Dad's skin stood in the doorway. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

His shadow stretched up the wall behind him—not the blocky shape of a man but something spindly, with too many elbows and knees that bent backward. The neck lengthened when the nightlight flickered, stretching like taffy before snapping back to normal. His eyes caught the glow—just for a second—flashing yellow-green like a coyote's caught in headlights, pupils slit vertically instead of round. Hungry. He didn't blink, staring with those unblinking predator's eyes as if waiting for me to bark, wake Catherine, and force him to peel off that face and show us what writhed underneath.

Then—

""Bedtime, Buddy.""

The voice was Dad's, but wet like it had to push through a throat full of maggots.

Catherine stirred. The thing's head rotated toward her—smooth, boneless—and its jaw unhinged slightly. A thread of saliva stretched between its teeth.

I growled, low and rattling, the sound that used to make burglars freeze on our porch.

The thing exhaled through its nose—a hiss of rotting leaves—and stepped back. Not walking. Gliding. Its shadow stayed behind for a heartbeat, clawing at the doorframe before snapping back to its heels.

The dark swallowed it whole.

But the smell remained.

It's like a wet den, like a gutted deer, like something that remembers how to wear skin but not how to wash the death off.

I stayed pressed against Catherine's bed all night, watching the door. Waiting for the eyes to reappear.

Waiting for the real Dad to come home.

The next morning, Dad's smell had worsened.

It hit me the moment I limped into the kitchen—**thick and meaty**, like when we'd find dead raccoons under the porch in summer. He stood at the counter, his back to me, shoulders hunched wrong. Too high. Too sharp.

*""Morning, Buddy.""*

His voice cracked down the middle, splitting into two tones: Dad's baritone and something **buzzing** beneath it. He turned slowly as if his spine had too many joints.

I froze.

His eyes were still brown… but the whites had yellowed, veins bulging black like cracks in old ice. His lips stretched too wide when he smiled, showing gums that oozed pink-tinged saliva.

**""Hungry?""**

He dropped a handful of kibble into my bowl. It landed with a **wet slap**, the pellets glistening with something oily. The smell made my nose wrinkle—**antiseptic and spoiled milk.**

From the table, Catherine giggled.

She couldn't see it. Couldn't **smell** it.

Dad's hand twitched toward her hair, then jerked back like he'd been burned. His fingers curled into claws for a second before flattening.

*""Eat up, Buddy,""* he murmured.

But his jaw kept moving after the words stopped, **grinding side to side like a cow chewing cud.** A chunk of something dark wedged between his molars—**maybe meat. Maybe fabric.**

I whimpered.

Dad's head snapped toward me. His nostrils flared, **inhaling my fear.** Then he winked—**slow, deliberate**—with an eyelid that closed *vertically.*

The bath came without warning.

One moment, I was dozing by Catherine's homework; the next—**cold hands clamped around my belly**, lifting me toward the tub. The thing wearing Dad's face smiled down at me, its breath reeking of **roadkill and mint toothpaste.**

*""You stink, mutt.""*

The water burned. Not from heat—from whatever **slick, iridescent soap** it poured into the stream. My fur matted instantly, weighing me down as its fingers dug between my shoulders.

*""Let's see…""*

Its nails—**too long, too curved**—parted my fur like skinning a rabbit. I yelped as they scraped my bare flesh, probing for something.

*""Almost ripe,""* it whispered.

Then Catherine was there, giggling as she rubbed shampoo in my ears. *""Dad's being weird again!""*

The thing laughed—**Dad's laugh, Dad's teeth**—but its eyes stayed locked on mine. **Black pupils swallowing brown.**

I found the skin three nights later.

The laundry room hummed with the scent of **blood and fabric softener.** There, tangled in Mom's sweatpants—**a palm-sized patch of Dad.**

Pink at the edges. Still **warm.**

His Marine Corps tattoo stared up at me, the eagle's wings crumpled like crepe paper. I nudged it with my nose. **No smell.** As if it had never been alive.

Above the dryer, the basement door creaked open.

*""Buddy?""*

The thing stood on the stairs, backlit by the kitchen light. Its silhouette was **all wrong—spine too straight, arms too long.**

*""Come.""*

It was Dad's voice. Then Catherine's. Then **nothing human at all.**

The mirror became its favorite toy.

I'd catch it at night, standing in the hallway, **practicing.**

First, Dad's scratchy morning voice: *""Coffee's ready.""*

Then Mom's sigh: *""Jacob, not again.""*

Then Catherine's—**high, sweet, perfect**—as its jaw unhinged to make room for the pitch: *""I love you, Buddy!""*

Last night, it noticed me watching.

Its reflection didn't.

The thing in the mirror kept mouthing words while the real one turned, **neck rotating like an owl's**, and whispered:

*""Want to play fetch?""*

It held up Dad's severed hand.

The fingers twitched.

The food got better.

That was the first thing I noticed. No more kibble—now it was **bacon glistening with grease**, **steak scraps still pink in the middle**, **chicken skin crackling hot from the pan**. The kind of food I used to beg for with drooling desperation.

The taste was… **off.** A metallic tang underneath, like licking the bottom of Mom's slow cooker. But I ate it anyway. My teeth weren't what they used to be, and hunger drowned out the warnings in my gut.

I slept more, too.

Deep, heavy sleeps where my legs twitched with dreams of running—**real running**, the kind I hadn't done in years. I'd wake panting to find **Dad's hands** on me, parting my fur, pressing cold fingers to the thin skin of my belly.

*""Good boy,""* he'd murmur, but his voice kept changing. Sometimes, it was Mom's. Sometimes Catherine's. Sometimes it was **no voice at all**, just a wet clicking in his throat.

I wanted to growl, to bite, but my body felt **loose and warm** like I was floating in the bathtub again.

The chocolate smelled so sweet.

A whole bar of it melted on the kitchen tiles. **Dark. Shiny.** The kind Mom used to scream at Catherine for leaving out.

I shouldn't. I *knew* I shouldn't.

But my tongue dragged me forward anyway, lapping at the sticky puddle. It tasted **bitter and wrong**, but underneath—**so rich, so familiar.** Like the time Catherine secretly shared her Halloween candy when I was still young enough to jump onto her bed.

My legs buckled.

The tiles were cool against my cheek. From somewhere far away, I heard **footsteps.** Too many. Too light.

*""Is it working?""* Catherine asked. Except it wasn't Catherine. Hadn't been for a while.

*""Almost,""* Dad said. His shadow stretched over me, **long and spindly**, fingers brushing my ear one last time.

*""Good dog.""*

I closed my eyes.

The pain in my joints dulled to a throb, but my mind wouldn't settle. That smell on Dad—moldering leaves and wet meat—it wasn't just wrong. It was old. The kind of stench that clung to deep woods and dens where things weren't supposed to die but did anyway.

My heartbeat kicked faster. Pack. Warn pack.

I hauled myself up, nails scraping the hardwood as I steadied my legs. Catherine's face was smushed into her pillow, one arm curled around Mr. Bubbles, the stuffed frog I'd ""killed"" for her three birthdays ago.

A whine built in my throat—

Click.

The sound of a toenail on tile. Not mine.

The air changed. Static. Salt. The smell of hot pennies and spoiled milk.

I turned.

The thing wearing Dad's skin stood in the doorway. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

His shadow stretched up the wall behind him—not the blocky shape of a man but something spindly, with too many elbows and knees that bent backward. The neck lengthened when the nightlight flickered, stretching like taffy before snapping back to normal. His eyes caught the glow—just for a second—flashing yellow-green like a coyote's caught in headlights, pupils slit vertically instead of round. Hungry. He didn't blink, staring with those unblinking predator's eyes as if waiting for me to bark, wake Catherine, and force him to peel off that face and show us what writhed underneath.

Then—

""Bedtime, Buddy.""

The voice was Dad's, but wet like it had to push through a throat full of maggots.

Catherine stirred. The thing's head rotated toward her—smooth, boneless—and its jaw unhinged slightly. A thread of saliva stretched between its teeth.

I growled, low and rattling, the sound that used to make burglars freeze on our porch.

The thing exhaled through its nose—a hiss of rotting leaves—and stepped back. Not walking. Gliding. Its shadow stayed behind for a heartbeat, clawing at the doorframe before snapping back to its heels.

The dark swallowed it whole.

But the smell remained.

It's like a wet den, like a gutted deer, like something that remembers how to wear skin but not how to wash the death off.

I stayed pressed against Catherine's bed all night, watching the door. Waiting for the eyes to reappear.

Waiting for the real Dad to come home.

The next morning, Dad's smell had worsened.

It hit me the moment I limped into the kitchen—**thick and meaty**, like when we'd find dead raccoons under the porch in summer. He stood at the counter, his back to me, shoulders hunched wrong. Too high. Too sharp.

*""Morning, Buddy.""*

His voice cracked down the middle, splitting into two tones: Dad's baritone and something **buzzing** beneath it. He turned slowly as if his spine had too many joints.

I froze.

His eyes were still brown… but the whites had yellowed, veins bulging black like cracks in old ice. His lips stretched too wide when he smiled, showing gums that oozed pink-tinged saliva.

**""Hungry?""**

He dropped a handful of kibble into my bowl. It landed with a **wet slap**, the pellets glistening with something oily. The smell made my nose wrinkle—**antiseptic and spoiled milk.**

From the table, Catherine giggled.

She couldn't see it. Couldn't **smell** it.

Dad's hand twitched toward her hair, then jerked back like he'd been burned. His fingers curled into claws for a second before flattening.

*""Eat up, Buddy,""* he murmured.

But his jaw kept moving after the words stopped, **grinding side to side like a cow chewing cud.** A chunk of something dark wedged between his molars—**maybe meat. Maybe fabric.**

I whimpered.

Dad's head snapped toward me. His nostrils flared, **inhaling my fear.** Then he winked—**slow, deliberate**—with an eyelid that closed *vertically.*

The bath came without warning.

One moment, I was dozing by Catherine's homework; the next—**cold hands clamped around my belly**, lifting me toward the tub. The thing wearing Dad's face smiled down at me, its breath reeking of **roadkill and mint toothpaste.**

*""You stink, mutt.""*

The water burned. Not from heat—from whatever **slick, iridescent soap** it poured into the stream. My fur matted instantly, weighing me down as its fingers dug between my shoulders.

*""Let's see…""*

Its nails—**too long, too curved**—parted my fur like skinning a rabbit. I yelped as they scraped my bare flesh, probing for something.

*""Almost ripe,""* it whispered.

Then Catherine was there, giggling as she rubbed shampoo in my ears. *""Dad's being weird again!""*

The thing laughed—**Dad's laugh, Dad's teeth**—but its eyes stayed locked on mine. **Black pupils swallowing brown.**

I found the skin three nights later.

The laundry room hummed with the scent of **blood and fabric softener.** There, tangled in Mom's sweatpants—**a palm-sized patch of Dad.**

Pink at the edges. Still **warm.**

His Marine Corps tattoo stared up at me, the eagle's wings crumpled like crepe paper. I nudged it with my nose. **No smell.** As if it had never been alive.

Above the dryer, the basement door creaked open.

*""Buddy?""*

The thing stood on the stairs, backlit by the kitchen light. Its silhouette was **all wrong—spine too straight, arms too long.**

*""Come.""*

It was Dad's voice. Then Catherine's. Then **nothing human at all.**

The mirror became its favorite toy.

I'd catch it at night, standing in the hallway, **practicing.**

First, Dad's scratchy morning voice: *""Coffee's ready.""*

Then Mom's sigh: *""Jacob, not again.""*

Then Catherine's—**high, sweet, perfect**—as its jaw unhinged to make room for the pitch: *""I love you, Buddy!""*

Last night, it noticed me watching.

Its reflection didn't.

The thing in the mirror kept mouthing words while the real one turned, **neck rotating like an owl's**, and whispered:

*""Want to play fetch?""*

It held up Dad's severed hand.

The fingers twitched.

The food got better.

That was the first thing I noticed. No more kibble—now it was **bacon glistening with grease**, **steak scraps still pink in the middle**, **chicken skin crackling hot from the pan**. The kind of food I used to beg for with drooling desperation.

The taste was… **off.** A metallic tang underneath, like licking the bottom of Mom's slow cooker. But I ate it anyway. My teeth weren't what they used to be, and hunger drowned out the warnings in my gut.

I slept more, too.

Deep, heavy sleeps where my legs twitched with dreams of running—**real running**, the kind I hadn't done in years. I'd wake panting to find **Dad's hands** on me, parting my fur, pressing cold fingers to the thin skin of my belly.

*""Good boy,""* he'd murmur, but his voice kept changing. Sometimes, it was Mom's. Sometimes Catherine's. Sometimes it was **no voice at all**, just a wet clicking in his throat.

I wanted to growl, to bite, but my body felt **loose and warm** like I was floating in the bathtub again.

The chocolate smelled so sweet.

A whole bar of it melted on the kitchen tiles. **Dark. Shiny.** The kind Mom used to scream at Catherine for leaving out.

I shouldn't. I *knew* I shouldn't.

But my tongue dragged me forward anyway, lapping at the sticky puddle. It tasted **bitter and wrong**, but underneath—**so rich, so familiar.** Like the time Catherine secretly shared her Halloween candy when I was still young enough to jump onto her bed.

My legs buckled.

The tiles were cool against my cheek. From somewhere far away, I heard **footsteps.** Too many. Too light.

*""Is it working?""* Catherine asked. Except it wasn't Catherine. Hadn't been for a while.

*""Almost,""* Dad said. His shadow stretched over me, **long and spindly**, fingers brushing my ear one last time.

*""Good dog.""*

I closed my eyes.

1k0myyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1k0myyn/7_month_progress/,7 month progress,"I am 25M, 180lb, and I would say very active. No medications. No known history of any family with cholesterol issues because almost no one in my wider family goes to the doctor.

I had a lipid panel done September 2024 with some numbers being high. This one was with 12 hours of fasting.

* Total cholesterol - 238
* Triglyceride - 79
* HDL - 55
* LDL - 167
* Lipoprotein (a) - not tested this time

I was recommended for a preventive cardiology appointment which I completed recently (April 2025) and they did another lipid panel for me. This one was non-fasting.

* Total cholesterol - 185 (down 53)
* Triglycerides - 85
* HDL - 56
* LDL - 112 (down 55)
* Lipoprotein (a) - 13

When I first received the results in September, I made a few diet changes and that was about it. Prior to September, I ate fairly clean at home, and would go out for food like 40-50% of the time (mainly for lunch and/or dinner). I would always have breakfast at home. 

Changes I made: 

* I was eating 4 eggs for breakfast every day prior to September. I stopped that and now have oatmeal every morning with blueberries and honey, sometimes a banana. I'll still have eggs maybe once a week.
* Adding more fruits/vegetables to meals.
* Started to buy cashews and have those for a snack almost daily.
* Dark chocolate. I found a 90% dark chocolate from Walmart that I really liked. The brand is bettergoods. The dark chocolate + cashews pairs very nicely with my coffee that I drink daily.
* Tried to lower my red meat consumption. I was eating steaks maybe 1-2 times per week, and would often make ground beef. I think I've had steak maybe 3-5 times in the past 7 months. I also transitioned over to ground bison instead of ground beef. I buy it from Costco and have it usually once a week. It is a bit pricier, but I find it tastes a bit better, and it seems to be healthier than ground beef from the limited research I've done.
* More fish and chicken. Started to have salmon 2-3 times a week. Increased chicken consumption a little more after decreasing red meat. I always have skinless chicken thigh/breast.
* I would always make basmati rice, sweet potato, or quinoa for my carbs. I would sometimes make pasta, but those 3 were my main carbs. This was the same before September.
* I am trying to go out less because I don't like spending money on restaurants/fast food, but I'm not perfect with it. I still have some bad meals (wings, pizza, tacos, burgers, Chick-Fil-A, Chipotle) a few times throughout the month, mainly social outings with friends. 
* I do consume some alcohol, mainly beer or cocktails, not too much wine. I would only have 1-2 drinks in a sitting. I would very rarely have 3 or more in one sitting. I've been tracking my drinking stats for all of 2024 and am continuing to track in 2025. Prior to September, I would have a drink about 10-15 days out of each month on average. I've been trying to limit that down to about 4 or less days for each month that I'm having a drink.

As for exercise/activity, I've been very consistent with working out the last 3+ years. I continued doing that. I mainly do strength training (chest day, back day, shoulders, legs). The last 1-2 months I started adding more cardio and am trying to do 15-30 minutes on the stairmaster daily (I hate running). I play sports 2-3 times a week with friends for a couple hours per session so that also gets me some cardio.

Overall, a few diet changes helped me lower my cholesterol and LDL by about 50 points over the span of 7 months.",2,1744816686.0,Cholesterol,1,1.0,False

We almost only have milk drinks, for me very strong, like a cortado.

We only use dark roasts, prizing the chocolatey side of things. No shade on others but we do not like espresso / espresso drinks with medium or light roasts.

So, what grinder / machine should we get?

I see the love for DF54. I see that some think conical is better for our favored dark/chocolatey, but I don't see a conical in that price range that is specifically near that good for espresso (no interest in anything else than espresso)??

Bambino is a possibility but I'd like to take the change to graduate from Breville. Worried about reliability of apex/legato: lots of complains on Amazon. Would love a \~ $1000 machine but too far out of budget.

Background info; I am diagnosed with -  ASD, Major Depression, Insomnia and 'traumatic assault' (acute stress disorder) on my medical records. Highly likely I have PTSD or C-PTSD.

I was on zopiclone and sertraline, but zopiclone can't be taken regularly and sertraline felt like bad speed and made me insomnia far worse. Now I've been put on Mirtazapine, which is a tetracyclic. 

Night: I took it at 8.30pm, had a snack, felt very sleepy by 10:20pm. It wasn't like zopiclone, I didn't hallucinate or have any weird tactile sensations. I fell asleep and had some vivid dreams, which was nice. 

I woke up and it was difficult to get out of bed as usual. Sleep was mostly undisturbed, no metallic taste like zopiclone. 

I actually drank ALL of my coffee. Swallowing was way easier! That's awesome for me, usually I find it hard to get anything down. 

I felt reeeallly spacey today. But calm, which was nice! I still had negative thoughts, but they didn't start looping or cascading like normal. My movements seemed more robotic, slower but more sporadic too. Definitely wouldn't be able to drive in the morning on this. 

I had maybe three flashbacks (big improvement) and my thought process during was different, I didn't feel the need to fixate on it. I also found myself more motivated at work despite being so spacey, more present in the external world and feeling like my control of my thoughts was improved. Instead of flashbacks I basically had songs replaying in my head, which reminds me of my thought process before my PTSD flareup. 

I've had the MUNCHIES all day. I'm very small and borderline underweight. I'll leave what I end up eating in the comments. 

All in all, I'm feeling pretty good! Side effects definitely aren't as bad, and I'll take spacey over nausea or feeling wired any day. Early days so I'm aware most of this will just be from the sedative and antihistamine effects. ",1,1744816614.0,Mirtazapine_Remeron,0,1.0,False

Did you know your coffee maker might be *dirtier than your bathroom*? I'm not exaggerating - according to a 2011 NSF International study, coffee makers ranked as one of the top 10 germiest places in homes, with about 50% containing yeast and mold. 🤢

That daily cup of joe you love so much? It could be coming with a side of microbial growth. But don't worry - I've got you covered with an easy, natural cleaning solution.

## Why Your Coffee Maker Needs Regular Cleaning

When we make coffee every day, oils and minerals build up inside the machine, creating:
* A perfect home for germs and bacteria
* Mineral deposits that affect machine performance
* Bitter residues that ruin your coffee's flavor
* Potential clogs that shorten your machine's lifespan

## The Simple Vinegar Solution

The beauty of this cleaning method is how easy and affordable it is. No need for expensive cleaning products!

**You'll need:**
* White vinegar
* Water
* 30-60 minutes of time
* A little patience

## Step-by-Step Cleaning Process

1. **Empty and rinse** your carafe and remove any old grounds
2. **Mix equal parts** white vinegar and water
3. **Fill the reservoir** with this solution
4. **Run a half brew cycle**, then pause
5. **Let it sit for one hour** (this is when the magic happens!)
6. **Complete the brewing cycle** and discard the solution
7. **Run 2-3 complete cycles** with fresh water to remove vinegar residue
8. **Wash removable parts** with hot, soapy water
9. **Wipe exterior** with a damp cloth and dry thoroughly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| DON'T | WHY |
|:-----|:-----|
| Use abrasive cleaners | Creates scratches where bacteria can hide |
| Clean with bleach/harsh chemicals | Leaves harmful residues that affect taste |
| Skip thorough rinsing | Results in vinegar-flavored coffee (yuck!) |
| Clean while hot | Safety hazard - wait until machine cools |
| Wait too long between cleanings | Allows stubborn buildup that's harder to remove |

## Pro Tips From an Experienced Cleaner

* **Monthly deep cleaning** is ideal for most households
* **Wipe the exterior daily** to prevent dust and oil buildup
* **Rinse the carafe and filter basket** after each use
* **Use filtered water** to reduce mineral buildup in the first place
* **Replace your coffee maker** every 5-7 years if you use it daily

## Why This Matters

That first cup of morning coffee is sacred for many of us. Taking just 30-60 minutes once a month to clean your coffee maker properly ensures:

1. Your coffee tastes fresh and delicious every time
2. You're not consuming harmful bacteria with breakfast
3. Your machine runs efficiently and lasts longer
4. You save money on replacements and repairs

Don't let a dirty coffee maker compromise your daily ritual. This simple vinegar cleaning method works on most types of coffee makers (drip, single-cup, etc.) and keeps your machine in prime condition.

Your taste buds will thank you, and you'll save money by extending your coffee maker's life for years to come.

1k0mtcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1k0mtcn/the_book_of_dilligaf/,The Book Of DILLIGAF,"In the beginning, there was rage.
Not the kind you scream at traffic,
But the quiet kind—
The kind you swallow every morning

With lukewarm gas station coffee
And three hours of sleep
Because someone called off
And you’re always the one they call.

I clocked in with eyes still bleeding from the night shift,
Feet still aching from the last one,
Soul rusted over with routine.

And then came Karen — Clipboard crusader, 
Corporate clergy in a blouse too bright.
“Can you do me a favor?”
DO I LOOK LIKE I GIVE A FUCK?
That was the spark.
That was the scripture.

And as I punched in, barely alive,
She asked why I looked so sour.
I stared straight through her and said,
“I wasn’t even supposed to be here today.”

See, I’ve been holding it all together
With rusted bolts and heavy metal will.

I’m the anchor in a house full of storms:
A wife with fire in her fists and loyalty in her heart,
A daughter blinded by love,
Backing a grown-ass man who won’t work,
Who yells at his kids while the rest of us raise them.

He plays goddamn video games all day—
Headset on, mouth running,
While I haul the weight of a life
He didn’t earn.

And still I grind, still I pay.
Still I bleed through the workweek
Just to keep the lights on
For people who don’t even say thanks.

College? Dropped out.
Dreams? Drowned.
That computer repair store?
Never opened.

Just bills,
More bills,
And that same numb silence
That hums behind every fake “I’m fine.”

So when Karen asks again,
“Can you pick up the pace?”
I smile like a devil in disguise and say:
DO I LOOK LIKE I GIVE A FUCK?!
Because this is my sermon.
This is my psalm.
This is for every hour I gave
And never got back.

And yeah—there’s an angel in my bed.
The woman who sees what’s left of me
And still holds on.

She’s fire and steel,
The hothead with a lion’s heart,
And I’m the calm in her chaos,
The anchor in her storm.

She wants my love full-throttle,
But I’m running on fumes—
Tired bones, calloused soul,
Giving what I can,
Even when there’s nothing left to give.

This is the Gospel of the overworked,
The burned-out saints and the tired sinners,
The ones who show up,
Shut up,
And keep the world spinning
While everyone else coasts.

So I walk this tightrope,
Between who I was
And who I have to be,
Held together by sarcasm,
Steel-toed boots,
And this gospel I wrote

On the back of an old pay stub:
DILLIGAF
Do I look like I give a fuck?
Not today.
Not ever.
Not until the world starts giving back
What it’s stolen.

We have both explored other relationships and realized that people are terrible over the past 7 years.  She moved into my new home in October and was seemingly very happy with us and the kids being in my home.

She needed to have a minor surgery and she wanted me to be there as I always have been.  During her surgery I was in the cafeteria to get some coffee and overheard two employees speaking about my ex wife.  She works there and is very well known.  They were talking about her having a procedure and got on the conversation of her and another employee.

Evidently they had seen somewhat explicit photos of her she shared with another employee who is a friend.  I let it go in one ear and out the other.  After her surgery it got me thinking and started eating at me.

I have been with her and caring for her at the hospital and this morning my curiosity finally got the better of me.  I asked to see her phone and sure enough it was true.

The second I wasn’t by her side she was messaging this other man.  Even when I was out of the room to get items for her and been by her side to help her.  As soon as I left to go back to the house at 11pm through 4am they were talking and sending photos.  She has even been sending this man photos of not only herself but my home as well.  Even saw where they had met up at the beach while she was on vacation with my kids when we were not together.

I screen recorded the messages and photos on her phone and gave it back to her.  I explained that I think it’s pretty fucked up and the fact she wants me to have zero contact with other women and that it is a double standard.

I do not trust her to love me or to be honest; I have no intention of outing her or the other man.  The kids and our parents have been through enough since we split.  I always thrive and make sure everyone else is taken care of before myself.  This time will be no different.  I have to keep silent, stay strong, be a good father, son, work hard, and take care of what is needed to the best of my ability.

I am just wondering if any other men do this and what I should do?",1,1744816072.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1k0moq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1k0moq7/bijagua_day_trip/,Bijagua day trip,"I am looking for some help planning a day in Bijagua from Flamingo. We have a car rented so we don’t need transportation. 

The plan would be to leave early in the morning, stop at Llano del Cortes waterfall on the way. From there I am considering a sloth tour, hanging bridges, coffee/chocolate tour, Rio Celeste or anything else interesting really. With the long drive there is only so much we can do. 

At some point I thought I read somewhere about a farm with chocolate and coffee that also has sloths and frogs? seems like a great way to check several boxes if thats the case. Seeing sloths and experiencing the rainforest is the priority! I have two kids 8 & 12. 

Any help would be very much appreciated!! Thanks.",1,1744815968.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1k0momj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1k0momj/made_my_first_amends/,Made my first amends!,"Hey friends :) just wanted to drop in and share an awesome moment.

I’m six months sober and I just made my first amends - to my dad. 
My dad used to go between angry dry drunk and irresponsible drinking every couple years. Most of my childhood he was just miserable to be around. I hated him. We barely spoke, despite living in the same house. Now my dad is also in recovery (somewhere around 3 years through Celebrate Recovery).

I was so nervous about making amends. I’m also horrible at talking when I’m remotely nervous, so my sponsor encouraged me to write them as letters and read them. 

Anyways, I called my dad last week to ask when I could give him his amends, after completing his letter and running it by my sponsor, and this morning we went out for breakfast. He was so gracious and understanding, and he’s telling me he’s proud of me - that is HUGE.

We both walked away smiling with plans to go get breakfast/coffee each week so we can get better at talking to each other :)

I am so relieved to have my first amends done, and I am unbelievably grateful for my dad ❤️",17,1744815961.0,alcoholicsanonymous,6,1.0,False

1k0mogv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransformersMemes/comments/1k0mogv/chinese_exporters_on_rednote_ask_local_consumers/,Chinese exporters on Rednote ask local consumers to buy goods meant for US,"Chinese sellers of items from lunch boxes to appliances have taken to social media platform Rednote to generate sympathy purchases, telling domestic consumers they are offloading stock at bargain prices amid U.S. tariffs.

Over the past week, dozens of sellers have broadcast livestreams showing goods produced for U.S. customers, which they said they could no longer sell because of tariff rates of 145% for made-in-China goods imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.

In one livestream, user ""Dingding Cloud Foreign Trade Warehouse"" sells small appliances, including rice cookers, juicers and toasters by telling viewers: ""The U.S. has breached its contract. No more shipments! Everything is on sale at 90% off!""

In another video, by user ""Muzi Has Good Goods,"" a host hawked appliances while surrounded by boxes marked ""trade transit containers"", saying they had no more space in their warehouse because of orders they could no longer send to the U.S.

Some of the sellers sold items such as Costa Coffee mugs, but most were brands not widely known abroad, such as OSTMARS and APLX, which are sold on Amazon.

The push comes as China has declared that it will help Chinese exporters sell goods domestically, touting its giant, though of-late sluggish, domestic consumer market as an alternative to the U.S. market after Trump's tariffs.",0,1744815950.0,TransformersMemes,0,0.5,False

Not sure if this makes sense but here it is. I've tried to be healthier- more exercise and healthy diet- multiple times in my life. It started as unhealthy food restrictions in high school due to oooe body image and progressed into a full eating disorder that I am now past. If we're being honest, my body image now is neutral. I'm happy the vessel gets me through life but it's never looked how I wanted it to. I try to be peacefully accepting of my body because it wrecks my mental health to have weight loss goals. 

I did an entire year with no processed sugar- didn't notice feeling better or any health benefits. It just amounted to denying myself anything as a treat and like... treats are one of life's small joys. Went back to eating whatever. 

I ran every other day for about 6 years in high school and college but it was always due to self hatred and poor body image, and never did anything for my happiness. I still dropped out of school due to misery. 

Did yoga almost every day for months (6 days a week at home following a video series). Again, I just cannot tell a difference. I didn't feel better mentally or physically enough to keep doing it. I end up feeling like ""what's the point"" when it doesn't seem to help me. 

I feel some of this stems from my extremely poor ability to tell how I'm feeling and feel things in my body. Has anyone else experienced this with the healthier habits? I find it extremely hard to ""stick to a routine"" and nothing ever becomes habit besides having a cup of coffee right when I wake up. 

At this point I eat whatever I can get myself to eat, usually one meal a day of whatever I can convince myself to be in the mood for. Definitely not a balanced diet.

And my supervisor says to all of us, that if we have any suggestions to help “Improve” anything for the residents, we should tell her. I made a light hearted suggestion that the food that is served for them should be switched up a bit. 

I notice the food they give them for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. And it’s just sad, they pay all this money and the food is ridiculous. For example, for breakfast yesterday. They served scramble eggs, with no salt or pepper. Toast that looked awful. Plain black coffee that was cold. For dinner, they served them steak, mashed potatoes, and some potatoe salad I believe. First off, everything is really chewy. I tried the steak once and it was really chewy. The mashed potatoes felt really lumpy and again, no seasoning.

I made a suggestion that the residents deserve better. My coworker claimed that I was rude for making that suggestion. She says “you’re insulting the kitchen staff”. I know the kitchen staff have no control over the menu, but I know somewhere somebody in this company does. And for these residents who I see write checks all the time and give them to me. They don’t deserve this “food”. Again, especially with all this money they pay. No one deserves to live on boring food their whole life.

# Cuisinart Grind & Brew Coffee Maker (2025): Is It STILL the Best? Review & Alternatives

For coffee lovers, the aroma of freshly ground beans mingling with the anticipation of a perfect brew is a ritual. The Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker has, for many years, been a popular choice for those seeking to streamline this morning routine. But as we head into 2025, is the Cuisinart still the best automatic coffee maker with grinder? This review will dive deep into the Cuisinart grind brew, exploring its features, benefits, potential drawbacks, and comparing it to alternatives, helping you decide if it's the right choice for your needs.

**Who is the Cuisinart Grind & Brew For?**

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's consider who would benefit most from a Cuisinart coffee machine grind and brew. The Cuisinart grind and brew targets several distinct user groups:

*   **The Convenience Seeker:** Are you a busy professional or parent who craves a seamless morning routine? Do you value efficiency and want to eliminate the extra step of grinding beans separately? The Cuisinart offers a one-stop solution for the perfect cup, and for many, time *is* that extra luxury.

*   **The Coffee Enthusiast (Entry-Level):** Are you looking to elevate your coffee experiance beyond pre-ground beans but are intimidated by complex brewing setups? Do want to experiment with fresher coffee, without having to invest in separate grinders, and scales? The Cuisinart acts as an accessible bridge into the world of freshly ground flavor.

*   **The Price-Conscious Quality Seeker:** Do you appreciate a good deal and carefully research before making a purchase? Are you looking for a grind and brew coffee maker that offers a balance of functionality, build quality and price? The Cuisinart aims to deliver value without compromising on the essentials.

*   **The Gift Giver:** Are you searching for a practical and thoughtful gift for a coffee-loving freind or family member? Do you want to give something long-lasting and easy to use, with a strong brand name, ensuring they'll be getting the most out of their gift for years to come? The Cuisinart's reliability and reputation make it a safe bet.

**What is a ""Grind and Brew"" Coffee Maker and Why Should You Care?**

A grind and brew coffee machine automates the coffee-making process by grinding whole beans immediately before brewing. This system results in several advantages over using pre-ground coffee:

*   **Fresher Flavor:** Grinding beans right before brewing preserves volatile oils that are responsible for coffee's aroma and taste. Using pre-ground coffee has inherent degradation that grind before brew machine aims to minimize.

*   **Convenience:** No need for a separate grinder! The all-in-one design saves counter space and simplifies your coffee routine. Especially helpful for those seeking to minimize appliances.

*   **customization (Limited):** Some models allow you to adjust the grind size and coffee strength, giving you some (though not extensive) control over the final result.

**Cuisinart Grind & Brew: A Closer Look**

The Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker comes in several models, each with its own features and (of course) price point.As of 2025, here are some of the most popular options to look out for when trying to find the cuisinart coffee maker with grinder for you:

*   **Cuisinart DGB-900BC:** The Cuisinart DGB 900 fully automatic grind and brew is often considered the flagship model. It boasts a burr grinder for consistent grind size, a 12-cup capacity, 24-hour programmability, and adjustable auto-shutoff. The burr grinder is critically important, as it does create a better grind, and in turn flavor, than blade grinder models.*   **Cuisinart DGB-800:** This model is similar to the DGB-900, but it might offer slightly different features or a different carafe style. Keep an eye out for sales on the 800!

*   **Cuisinart DGB-700:** Often a more budget-friendly option, the DGB 700 might have a blade grinder instead of a burr grinder, which can impact the consistency and quality of the grind. It will still work, but at a noticeable decrease in extraction quality.

**Key Features to Consider**

When evaluating a Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker, focus on these critical features:

*   **Grinder Type (Burr vs. Blade):** A burr grinder uses two rotating abrasive surfaces to crush beans, producing a consistent particle size.A blade grinder, conversely, chops the beans with a spinning blade, resulting in an uneven grind. Burr grinders are generally preferred for better flavor extraction. You should try your very best to find a cuisinart burr grind and brew model.

*   **Capacity:** How many cups of coffee do you typically brew at once? Cuisinart grind and brew models commonly offer 10-cup,12-cup.

*   **Programmability:** The ability to program the coffee maker to automatically grind and brew at a set time is a significant convenience. The cuisinart grind and brew programmable coffee maker is a huge boon to simplify you morning routine.

*   **Carafe Type (Glass vs. Thermal):** Glass carafes sit on a warming plate to keep coffee hot, but this can lead to a burnt taste over time. Thermal carafes are insulated to maintain temperature without a warming plate, preserving the coffee's flavor.

*   **adjustable Grind Size and Strength:** Greater customizability means that you can have more control over tailoring the result to your taste

*   **Filter Type (Gold-tone vs. Paper):** Both are common, but gold-tone filters are permanent and washable, while paper filters are disposable.

**Pros and Cons of the Cuisinart Grind & Brew**

**Pros:**

*   **Convenience:** the biggest selling point is the all-in-one design. It simplifies the coffeemaking process substantially.*   **Freshly Ground Flavor:** Enjoy the superior taste of freshly ground coffee without the hassle of separate grinding.
*   **programmability:** Wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee every morning.
*   **Reputable Brand:** Cuisinart is a well-known and trusted brand in kitchen appliances.*   **Decent Value:** Offers a good balance of features and performance for the price.

**Cons:**

*   **Grinder Noise:** Grind and brew coffee machine are notoriously loud during the grinding process.
*   **Cleaning:** Cleaning the grinder components can be more involved than cleaning a regular coffee maker. Remember to look up cuisinart grind and brew cleaning methods to ensure properly cleaning.
*   **Grind Consistency (Varies by Model):** blade grinders, found in some cheaper models, produce an uneven grind.
*   **Limited customization:** Doesn't offer as much control over grind size and other brewing parameters as separate grinders and brewers.
*   **Potential for Clogging:** The grinder can sometimes clog, especially with oily beans. The cuisinart grind and brew troubleshooting guides should be consulted in the event of this issue.
*   **Durability:** While generally reliable, some users have reported issues with the grinder mechanism over time. Looking up cuisinart grind and brew parts, especially for older models, can be challenging.

**Potential Problems and How to Address Them**

Even the best appliances can experience hiccups. Here's how to troubleshoot common Cuisinart grind and brew issues:

*   **Grinder Clogging:** Use a small brush to clean out any coffee grounds stuck in the grinder. Avoid using oily beans, which are more prone to clogging.*   **Weak Coffee:** Adjust the grind size to a finer setting or use a stronger coffee bean ratio.
*   **Coffee Not Brewing:** Ensure the water reservoir is filled properly and that the filter is correctly placed. Check for any blockages in the water line.
*   **Error Messages:** Consult the user manual for specific error code solutions.*   **Carafe Breakage:** replacement carafes are available. Check for cuisinart grind and brew replacement carafe sold separately.

**Comparing Cuisinart Grind & Brew to Alternatives**

While the Cuisinart is a strong contender,it's not the onyl grind and brew coffee maker on the market. Here are a couple of alternatives to consider:

*   **Breville Grind Control:** This model offers more precise grind size control, allowing for greater brewing customization. It also has a single-cup brewing option. This comes are a higher price tag than the Cusinart, so consider budgeting accordingly.

*   **Capresso CoffeeTEAM GS:** This option also uses a burr grinder and offers a thermal carafe. Some users find it easier to clean than the Cuisinart. Capresso has remained a strong contender with a very loyal fanbase, so it is worth checking out.

*   **Budget Option: Black+Decker Mill and Brew:** Good as an absolute budget option, but beware that you often get what you pay for

When you compare grind and brew coffee makers, consider price, features, ease of use, and long-term reliability.

**Where to Buy a Cuisinart Grind & Brew**

You can find the Cuisinart grind and brew at most major retailers, both online and in stores. Look for sale at these locations when deciding where to buy cuisinart grind and brew:

*   **Amazon:** Offers a wide selection of models and competitive pricing.*   **Costco:** Often has exclusive bundles or discounts on Cuisinart products.
*   **Bed Bath & Beyond:** Carries a variety of Cuisinart coffee makers.
*   **Directly from Cuisinart:** Check the Cuisinart website for the latest models and deals.

**Is the Cuisinart Grind & Brew Still the Best in 2025?**

The answer depends on your priorities. If you prioritize convenience, value, and a reputable brand, the Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker remains a solid choice. Models with burr grinders offers a noticeable upgrade in coffee quality, delivering a fresher, more flavorful cup.

However, if you demand ultimate control over grind size and brewing parameters, or if budget allows, the Breville Grind Control or other high-end alternatives might be a better fit.The Cuisinart strikes a grate balance, however, making it a long time, classic appliance.

Ultimately, the best coffee maker is the one that best suits your individual needs and preferences. Weigh the pros and cons, consider your budget, and read reviews to make an informed decision. Happy brewing!

Everyone seemed impressed, and my boss (super chill guy, but also terrifying in a “I went to Stanford and make eye contact too intensely” kind of way) walks up to me and says:

“Hey, good job today.”

And for some godforsaken reason my brain decided to go on a coffee break right then, and I just instinctively replied:

**“You too.”**

Like what. What did I mean by that?? Good job... listening?? Breathing?? Standing there existing while I presented??

He paused for a second, did this weird polite chuckle thing like he wasn’t sure if I was joking or just deeply broken inside. I just nodded and power-walked away like nothing happened, but I’m 99% sure he’s now questioning my basic social functions.

I’ve said “you too” to waiters when they tell me “enjoy your meal.” I’ve said “you too” to flight attendants when they say “have a safe flight.” But this?? This might be the peak.

I get extremely frustrated whenever I come into contact with my mom. Our parents have been divorced for about 10 years now, and I've lived exclusively with her since then. Our relationship has never really felt like the standard mother-daughter bond, I was always the one she would rely on during tough times (moving out of the house, away from my dad, who at the time was addicted to and severely overdosing on anticonvulsants and antidepressants, helping her find a new place to stay at, cleaning and cooking whenever she just couldn't manage etc. )

About 3 years ago, I got diagnosed with anorexia, and it all went down from there. My mother just couldn't accept that I was ill and needed urgent care. She was never mean to me about my weight, although sometimes I would get a remark about her being thinner at my age. She has been very thin her whole life. When I told her I went into a full breakdown and stopped eating because of her, she screamed at me. She told me I was making it up. Our relationship has been weird ever since. Thankfully, I am mostly recovered now, but I just cannot STAND her presence. Almost everything she does irritates me to the point where I stopped talking to her completely for half a year, just because I couldn't handle it. What makes it even worse is that she has decided to copy me in a lot of the things I do. She uses my makeup without my permission, she's suddenly interested in coffee when I became a barista. She buys the same clothes (yes, the exact same ones), she inspects the things I eat and cook for myself and copies them entirely. We also argue a lot about me not wanting to cook meals for her (the sheer idea is extremely disgusting and anxiety-inducing for me). 

I feel terrible, and honestly, I really don't know what to do. I know she has a lot on her plate, and I know that deep inside, I love her and respect her, but I really cannot find a logical reason behind my extreme anger. I'm leaving for university soon, so I hope that'll make things a little more bearable, but I just cannot take the feeling of constantly being on edge when she's in the house with me. It's a cycle of feeling anxious, overwhelmed, frustrated, angry and then guilty for being angry and snapping at her.

1k0mbmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtohope/comments/1k0mbmq/fight_for_hope_chapter_13/,Fight For Hope | Chapter 13,"Scott and Lauren had unofficially moved their daytime office to a rarely used third-floor breakroom. It had a fancy coffee dispenser, a sweeping view of the town, and a tacky chartreuse sofa with many coffee stains on it, on which they could sit together with their laptops, quite a bit closer together than they strictly had to. Scott frowned dubiously as his email pinged, shaking him out of a deep analysis of the mysterious X-ray sources’ spectrographic signature. “Ugh, I can’t get us any more telescope time for the whole week,” he told Lauren, “Apparently, a bunch of NASA people are flying in next Monday and booked all our instruments. Nothing we can do about it.”  
  
Lauren rolled her eyes theatrically. “Don’t they know that we’re trying to study the first signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life?”  
  
“Well…actually they don’t,” said Scott thoughtfully, “The hypervelocity X-ray emitter paper is still hanging in review limbo and we haven’t even written the rest of the papers.”  
  
“About that…” Lauren handed her laptop to Scott, her hands brushing over his. They were soft and warm, and lingered longer than was strictly necessary. “I’ve made a dream list of all the observations we ought to do, and honestly, there’s so much on it that it…that \*they\* will be here before we can finish it all. Especially if we don’t have any telescope time next  week.”  
  
“And it’ll be hard to publish papers on them if they get here first,” muttered Scott.  
  
Before they could devise a resolution to this predicament, they were once again distracted by footsteps in the hall. The breakroom door creaked open; it was George Boyle. “Hey,” he said nodding at Scott, “I’ve been meaning to have a word with you about the telescope time up on the hill. So apparently, a lot of people have been complaining about you two monopolizing some of the instruments and…look, I get that you’re new here, but there are established procedures for booking time at the observatory. There are a lot of people trying to get important work done here, and I get that that includes you two, but still. If either of you have any questions, feel free to drop me an email.”  
  
Scott steepled his hands, cautiously considering his words for a moment. “Might it be possible to relax some of these ‘established procedures’ in the event that we’re very close to a momentous but extremely time-sensitive discovery?”  
  
Boyle sighed. “That’s what everyone says, that their work is special. And then we’re right back where we started.”  
  
“What if it’s about an imminent first  contact with an extraterrestrial civilization?” blurted out Lauren.  
  
“Good one!” Boyle laughed, turning to leave.  
  
“Wait!” called out Scott. In one abrupt motion, he leaped up from the couch, turning it to show Boyle the latest results on his laptop.

Boyle perused them, his face going through a rapid roller coaster of expressions. “Jesus fucking Christ,” he muttered at last, taking the laptop from Scott, “I need to sit down.” He sank heavily  into a chair.

“We believe they’re already entering the outer Solar System. If we want to dominate the race to publish, we need time and people ASAP,” said Scott, putting a subtle emphasis on the first ‘we’.

“Shit. This is insane,” said Boyle, pulling out his phone, “I gotta make some calls!”

“See?” whispered Scott to Lauren, “This field is about knowing people, not stars.”

The very next  morning, the two found themselves flanking Boyle in the observatory’s conference room. Behind the three of them, a projected powerpoint loomed above them, with the black text Possible Detection of Approaching Extraterrestrial Civilization on a plain white background; the thing was no-frills, having been thrown together overnight.

At least forty astronomers had piled in, filling up every available chair around the long table and leaving many to be awkwardly standing crammed against the walls. The room was abuzz with a dozen conversations, everyone straining to be heard over everyone else. Many more had joined online, and Lauren was anxiously scrolling through their names, looking a bit shaky and disheveled. “Shit,” she whispered to Scott, “My advisor is here. I know he’s gonna ask something difficult.”

Scott winced sympathetically and peeled off to grab himself some refreshments–someone had brought in a coffee dispenser and a large cake–but no sooner had he gotten them than Boyle pointed to his watch and motioned for Scott to come back to the front, and he awkwardly returned with his food.

“Good morning everyone, and thanks for coming up on such short notice,” said Boyle into a mic, and in an instant, the conversations died in an instant, replaced with a silence so palpable that one could hear a pin drop. “As you probably all know by now, two of our colleagues, visiting astronomers here at the Lowell Observatory–” he nodded at Scott and  Lauren, “–have recently assisted in the discovery of signs of two alien artifacts entering our Solar System. Of course, this is the most significant discovery in the history of this observatory, and a highly time sensitive one, as trajectory analysis shows they will likely arrive later this summer. As such, I’ve taken the initiative and created the First Contact Research Group. Assistant professor Scott Watson from UC Irvine will be the project’s main technical assistant. I’ve gone ahead and created a time code for those of us who work here.” Lauren shot Boyle a slightly miffed glance, but said nothing.

“One more word of caution before I hand over the mic to my colleagues,” Boyle went on, “As I’m sure you’re all aware, the new normal has brought a tense and polarized political landscape here and across the world, and the arrival of aliens will only deepen that divide, whether they turn out to be friendly or not, and they’re all but guaranteed to shake things up in ways we can’t predict. I thus have to ask for everyone’s temporary discretion, at least until we can prepare for a proper first contact, not just for national security, but for the safety of humanity. We don’t want the suits in Washington going and saying anything…stupid to our interstellar visitors, nor the media, nor random morons on TikTok. So yeah, let’s just leave first contact to the experts, shall we?”

“Otherwise, this might lead to them going,” he went on, making a finger gun gesture, “pew pew.” There were murmurs of assent from the astronomers, and a few titters. “Anyway, Scott, Lauren, the floor is yours.” He gave the mic to Scott.

Scott and Lauren pushed through their fairly dry and technical forty-minute presentation, whose slides were filled with bullet points in small font, diagrams of X-ray frequency and intensity, spectrograms, some very grainy optical images, and countless references to esoteric papers. At last, Lauren wrapped up the talk, rushing through the conclusion at a mile a minute, her mouth dry and her heart racing. For a moment, all was quiet, like the calm before the storm. Then she spoke the fateful two words that end any presentation: “Any questions?”

I still vividly remember watching that game with all of my family and going through a roller coaster of emotions as it played out. Plus going to the city afterwards to attend class and witnessing the madness of a Cubs, World Series victory.

The early points that got us super excited, the weird pitching changes, the possibility we were gonna blow it (again), the rain delay, the rally that ensued afterwards, and that final throw from Kris Bryant to Rizzo that legit made my heart stop. I, like everyone, was jumping up and down with joy, hugging my family and popping bottles of champagne. Easily one of the best sports memories of my life. 2016 was quite a weird year.

During this time, I was attending college in the city and had to commute by train that took roughly an hour to get there from Northern Illinois. I remember the following morning getting to the train station at around six am and some politician in the area that was running for election was there, with his assistant, handing out cups of coffee to everyone at the train station. Smart move on his end even though I had no intentions of voting for him.

Once I arrived in the city, it was just a sea of people in every direction. As I walking to class, some guy was selling bootleg cubs T-shirts near a building and spotted security guards walking towards him. Once he spotted them, he yelled out “I gotta go!” and bolted off into the crowd with T-shirts tucked underneath his arms. If you’re wondering, yes, classes were soon cancelled due to the festivities and I got to go home early. Going back to the train station was an absolute nightmare and I waited a good two hours to get on my train back home.

A day later, a picture started circulating around of my cousin climbing atop a street sign, with his shirt off (most likely drunk AF) and chanting something to the crowd beneath him. You could tell whatever he was chanting was really passionate and the crowds were eating it up.

Looking for opinions of the best pasta to accompany Wild Garlic Pesto. 

It's wild garlic (bärlauch) season right now. And I'm treating myself with my favorite, wild garlic pesto. We just moved here a few years ago, and the season hit slightly different in timing, so this is the first year I've been able to find the garlic (I use to forage it before, but we live now... there's not many forest areas around. So finally just found it in stores! So excited!)

I home-make my own pasta, and can grind any grain in my coffee grinder into a flour for pasta. So anything is up for making! Since I'm new, to homemaking my pasta and WFPB, I just haven't had many 'different' pastas yet (other than whole wheat) - so not sure which flavor profile of pasta would taste best with the bärlauchpesto.

1k0m9rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1k0m9rr/rethinking_nespresso/,Re-thinking Nespresso,"Read below—Thoughts?  Suggestions on a machine that would meet are needs?

Friend gave us her Nespresso machine (original capsule) Citiz when she moved from U.S.  Have always been a Nespresso fan.  We’ve had for about 6 years.  Wife and I brew about 6 pods daily.  She likes heavy non-dairy additive. I drink mine black.

I like that pods get recycled, would never buy a K-cup version for this reason (not into polluting planet or excessive consumerism or waste).  Buy quality, take care of things and expect them to last.  Like the look/design of nespresso machines (but not the plastic look) and pods.

Machine is leaking water from bottom.  
Descaling has not helped.  Still works, but constant drip from bottom of machine—maybe 3-6 big raindrops with each pod which adds up to a large puddle on counter after multiple uses.  I’m in the process of seeing how bad it leaks, now with a plate under it to see how much water it catches—will update.  Took awhile to recognize the issue and that it was coming from inside machine and running out bottom.  It has wrecked a couple of wood trays on which it sat, the counter is quartz so no damage there.  Putting a towel under the machine and changing out daily is also a short term solution.

Has served us well, thought I would get a new machine, but one of the comments I have read in many product reviews is that the machines commonly leak from the bottom.  Not scientific, but on Best Buy website about 25% of reviews mention such leaking.  Was looking at buying the expensive Creatista in either original or Vertuo.  

Typically order pods every month or two and mail in the provided recycle envelop full of spent pods.  

We recently (last 4-6 months) had some bad experiences with ordering:  shipments that never arrived, shipments taking too long to receive, out of stocks, shorted orders.  Previous to this no problems. Estimate we spend about $1200 annually on pods.

Now thinking we might go to a single cup machine that does not use pods, built-in coffee bean grinder such as Jura Z10 that costs a staggering $4K, however, reviews indicate that people have had machines for decades from this Swiss company without problems.  Buying coffee beans vs pods also means savings over time.

Thoughts?  Suggestions on a machine that would meet our needs?

I’ve been dating this girl for a couple years now, and things have changed not for the better. She has gained a considerable amount of weight, she has grown a fuzzy mustache, her romantic efforts have disappeared (both in and outside the bedroom), and she invests very little effort in her appearance. She is often disorganized, and it’s difficult to rely on her for any help—anything beyond the simplest tasks is too much to ask. She’s pretty helpless when it comes to navigating life sometimes.

She has plenty of quality traits too. She frequently verbalizes her affection, she does small token gestures (coffee in bed, throws my laundry in the wash, etc.), she is very tolerant of my personal life (I travel a lot for work and fun), she’s mostly financially independent, and she’s quite emotionally stable.

All positives aside, I’m simply not attracted to her anymore. I don’t want to be intimate with her as things are currently. I used to take her out to fun events and concerts almost every week, and I would take her on grand vacations domestically and abroad. Nowadays, I don’t like taking her out much at all. I feel embarrassed a little by her appearance and the lack of effort she puts into herself. 

I expect some disparity, but the disparity seems to have grown a lot over time. I make well over twice her income, and I pay for the vast majority of bills and fun expenditures. I keep myself in reasonable shape, and I tend to my personal appearance (eyebrow threading, nose waxing, Manscapping, etc.). I manage most of the household (errands, cooking, cleaning, maintenance, etc.), and I will generally only get help with the household if I expressly ask.

We have both explored other relationships and realized that people are terrible over the past 7 years.  She moved into my new home in October and was seemingly very happy with us and the kids being in my home.

She needed to have a minor surgery and she wanted me to be there as I always have been.  During her surgery I was in the cafeteria to get some coffee and overheard two employees speaking about my ex wife.  She works there and is very well known.  They were talking about her having a procedure and got on the conversation of her and another employee.

Evidently they had seen somewhat explicit photos of her she shared with another employee who is a friend.  I let it go in one ear and out the other.  After her surgery it got me thinking and started eating at me.

I have been with her and caring for her at the hospital and this morning my curiosity finally got the better of me.  I asked to see her phone and sure enough it was true.

The second I wasn’t by her side she was messaging this other man.  Even when I was out of the room to get items for her and been by her side to help her.  As soon as I left to go back to the house at 11pm through 4am they were talking and sending photos.  She has even been sending this man photos of not only herself but my home as well.  Even saw where they had met up at the beach while she was on vacation with my kids when we were not together.

I screen recorded the messages and photos on her phone and gave it back to her.  I explained that I think it’s pretty fucked up and the fact she wants me to have zero contact with other women and that it is a double standard.

I do not trust her to love me or to be honest; I have no intention of outing her or the other man.  The kids and our parents have been through enough since we split.

Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe!!!  
Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

  
Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:



* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far! 
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

 **A question to everyone for the comments, what Kendu products have you tried so far?**

https://preview.redd.it/sb60d30787ve1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3cef7d2565a316a9cd58625399bce010df6c9a8

Let me just say this…. All of these products have been created when the vast majority of Kendu holders are in the red. So, the average person is spending a lot of time and money to take a risk on their own project to help push Kendu forward! Where else can you see something like this?  


Thanks for reading up this point, I will close with some comments and let you get on your way!  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn’t have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is **unprecedented.** If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I’d recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore….

I'm hesitant to post this - both because I try to have good faith in people I don't know, and because while I might fancy myself a critical person, I don't in particular like being an outwardly mean person.  
  
This morning (2025-04-14), I'm scrolling through my Instagram, and Jordan's latest post comes up: And not only does this one feature some really ""great"" AI visuals, but it also features AI generated music through Udio. I watched it, took a sip of my coffee, and said to myself ""That's it. I guess I'm done."" 

Whatever that means of course. It was more of a revelation that between:   
\- The cover of Parasomnia absolutely being AI generated  
\- Hugh Syme reusing his own artwork from another band to fill out the artwork for Parasomnia (Here, if you don't know what I'm referring to: [Guy reports on FB Hugh copy / pasted his own album’s artwork for Parasomnia : r/Dreamtheater](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreamtheater/comments/1ijxgqm/guy_reports_on_fb_hugh_copy_pasted_his_own_albums/)) and nothing being done about it as far as I'm aware (please correct me if I'm wrong)  
\- Jordan's continuing inching from AI art and visuals to using AI music in his own content ([Teaming Up With Udio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLiJmIBnhpU))- And this morning's post...  
  
...that I sort of don't really want to support him, or to an extent DT anymore? For what little that's worth. To have a legitimately talented, possibly once in a generation musical influence start legitimizing and softening the impact of what generative AI is doing puts things into sharp relief. 

Jordan is only one of the members of the band granted, but to publicly see them all fairly silent on the Hugh Syme fiasco also doesn't give me a lot of confidence. I was planning on seeing them this fall, but with reports of, you guessed it, AI generated visuals at their live shows too, I think I'll pass - why should I care about what the band is doing if they clearly seem to be tapering back how much they care about the presentation? 

Or, who knows, the writing of their own music. ",23,1744814423.0,Dreamtheater,50,0.64,False
1k0m0mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k0m0mf/curious_what_to_dom40_and_f41/,Curious what to do…M40 and F41,"My ex wife (F 41, M 40) wanted to be back together because we have always been there for each other and our kids.

We have both explored other relationships and realized that people are terrible over the past 7 years.  She moved into my new home in October and was seemingly very happy with us and the kids being in my home.

She needed to have a minor surgery and she wanted me to be there as I always have been.  During her surgery I was in the cafeteria to get some coffee and overheard two employees speaking about my ex wife.  She works there and is very well known.  They were talking about her having a procedure and got on the conversation of her and another employee.

Evidently they had seen somewhat explicit photos of her she shared with another employee who is a friend.  I let it go in one ear and out the other.  After her surgery it got me thinking and started eating at me.

I have been with her and caring for her at the hospital and this morning my curiosity finally got the better of me.  I asked to see her phone and sure enough it was true.

The second I wasn’t by her side she was messaging this other man.  Even when I was out of the room to get items for her and been by her side to help her.  As soon as I left to go back to the house at 11pm through 4am they were talking and sending photos.  She has even been sending this man photos of not only herself but my home as well.  Even saw where they had met up at the beach while she was on vacation with my kids when we were not together.

I screen recorded the messages and photos on her phone and gave it back to her.  I explained that I think it’s pretty fucked up and the fact she wants me to have zero contact with other women and that it is a double standard.

I do not trust her to love me or to be honest; I have no intention of outing her or the other man.  The kids and our parents have been through enough since we split.  I always thrive and make sure everyone else is taken care of before myself.  This time will be no different.  I have to keep silent, stay strong, be a good father, son, work hard, and take care of what is needed to the best of my ability.

I am just wondering if any other men do this and what I should do?

1k0m0cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancelandia/comments/1k0m0cg/wild_and_wrangled_by_lyla_sage_and_the_importance/,Wild and Wrangled by Lyla Sage and the Importance of Showing and not Telling.,"Thank you to u/IrisDuggleby for feeding my vindication for hating this book.

I wanted to like this book, I loved 2/3 previous books in the series but there are just so many problems with it. I read an ARC copy in March and I don't know how u/fakexpearls and u/napamy put up with my complaints.

**Where to even start?** 😱

Dusty is written so perfectly that Camille is forever in his shadow. It's designed for people who want ""book boyfriends."" I don't self insert when I read, I want to read a romance between two characters, and this simply did not work. The fact that this book ends with him making a grand gesture to Camille is astounding.

 The reason they broke up in the past is ridiculous, especially as its sold as Camille needing to grow and become the person she is. Which, as I understand it, involved getting a law degree and job she doesn't want or enjoy, and improving her relationship with her awful parents. So, I don't know that I'd say it was worth it. 

The highlight of this book for me was in Chapter 11, when Camille notes that she finally has a childfree day to herself. Her daughter does not appear in the former ten chapters *at all*. Considering the plot of the previous book was her daughter living with her father for the entire summer, it seems like Camille has plenty of childfree days. 

**This book is a great example of why authors need to show and not tell.**

Telling me over and over how much Camille loves Riley or mentioning that she finally has a day to herself doesn't quite make up for the fact that on the page they're not together, apart from one coffee shop date, which I can only imagine was the idea of an editor who pointed out ""this woman spends no time with her daughter"". Also, taking a 7 year old out for a coffee date just reeks of someone who doesn't know how to be around children.  

When you add all this to Camille stating that she previously wasn't sure if she wanted children and now definitely doesn't want more, and theyre rarely together on the page, activley planned to marry a man and live with him as man and wife who had no interest in her child and who she was happy to keep them separate, and she seemed pretty content to spend an entire season away from her in the previous book, it just creates this vibe that makes me feel bad for her daughter. 

Sage also consistently tells us that Cam and Dusty are separately pining for each other. This in no way translates to feeling like they want to be together to the reader. Dusty's entire personality is being in love with Cam and Cam is so utterly boring (not to mention a shit mother) that I have no respect for Dusty for seeing anything in her to like/fancy/love. 

I objectively understand that there is a huge market for the ""down bad cinnamon roll hero"" in straight romances. This is not for me. I objectively understand that many straight women love the idea of a man who loves a woman (the self inserting reader) unconditionally and who just says yes to everything having no desires or preferences or personality of their own. I objectively understand the appeal of that. I do not share it. 

**How did this happen?** 

Is this one of those occasions where the pace of publishing demands has forced out a book before its been baked thoroughly? Sage can write and write well. This is not well written. I can't even say it feels like a first draft because there is absolutely no plot. It's no exaggeration to say that I cannot spoil the plot of this book because literally nothing happens.

Anyway. This is the last ARC I was approved for and likely will be approved for for some time, because I could not say a single nice thing about it other than that the cover is stunning. ",12,1744814294.0,romancelandia,9,1.0,False

Bought a Moka Pot from Amazon, bought Blue Tokai Silver Oak Cafe Blend (Moka Pot Version i.e., pre-ground cuz I didn't wanna buy some expensive grinder).

I had a cheap gram scale already so I didn't get a new one.

Added about 135 ml of water, half boiled half room temperature, used 17g of coffee (levelled with a spoon, not compressed). It took about 6m 15s to get the coffee coming.

Didn't let it sit on the stove continuously to avoid over extraction. Let it sit on the stove when the flow started, removed it when it stopped, repeated until flow completely stopped coming at all.

I then added warm water to it (Americano, cuz I sure as hell won't drink that completely concentrated extract). I also tried adding warm milk to it (not piping hot).

But... I didn't like it at all. It was still bitter. The coffee tastes okay but when I thought I'll go from inst*nt coffee to specialty, I'll taste something completely different.

Is it the flavor of coffee I got? Is it the way I made it? Is it Moka Pot maybe? Are those bad? I don't really know what's going on but it feels like an experiment failed :"")

The whole reason I thought I'll get into specialty coffee was that inst*nt coffee tastes like shit when taken black. Super bitter, no taste at all. Meanwhile people claim to have these sweeter, non-bitter feel with specialty coffee.

1k0lxsu,https://i.redd.it/f5pl9f04k7ve1.jpeg,The Gritti Palace in Venice,"The Gritti Palace is one of the finest hotels within Marriott’s vast portfolio.

Only a few hotels across all Marriott properties worldwide rival The Gritti Palace. Outside Marriott and compared to other hotels in Venice, The Gritti is also arguably the finest hotel in Venice. It is a genuine 5-star luxury hotel.

As a result, prices are very expensive. Over my stay, the rates varied between US$2,200 per night and US$10,000 per night, depending on the room type or suite. Needless to say, a guest has certain expectations when a hotel is charging that much money.

Here is what The Gritti did well: 

1. Concierge and Front Desk staff were excellent. In particular, the concierge staff are incredibly competent at organizing water taxis, tickets for attractions or tours, dinner reservations, etc.

2. The hotel provided a thoughtful in-room amenity. It also fulfilled basic preferences that were specified on the reservation.

3. Major newspapers, like The New York Times and Financial Times, are complimentary to guests.

4. Stationery and envelopes are provided for guests to write a letter home. The hotel also mails the letters free of charge.

5. The hotel’s public spaces are beautiful. The décor is exactly what you would expect for a 5-star hotel in a building that dates to the 15^(th) century.

6. Marriott Bonvoy benefits were delivered. Specifically:

(a) Suite upgrade. I was upgraded from a standard room to one of their best, if not their best, suites, the Patron Suite. It had a beautiful view of the Grand Canal. However, if I were given a choice, I probably would have turned down the suite in favor of a non-suite with a comparable view. I will discuss this later.

(b) Late check-out. I received a 4 p.m. late check-out. The hotel graciously allowed me to stay in the room free of charge until 6 p.m. That was most kind of them.

(c) The breakfast benefit for guests with Bonvoy platinum or higher status is excellent, with one exception: wine at breakfast. At breakfast on a Saturday morning, I asked if they had wine. I was offered Italian prosecco. However, the prosecco is a little sweet. I asked if they had an alternative, like a Trento DOCG. I was provided with Italian franciacorta sparkling wine. Franciacorta is drier and more like champagne. So, I ordered it. While my breakfast was complimentary, I was charged 170 euros for the bottle of wine. The charge was removed after I complained. Still, it is the principle of the matter. Either inform the guest that the wine is not complimentary before it is served or provide more than one complimentary wine option at breakfast.

Now, here is where I think The Gritti Palace needs improvement (especially given the prices charged):

1. Restaurants and bars. I was encouraged to have dinner at the hotel’s restaurant. I made a restaurant for the outside terrace. When I arrived for dinner, the terrace was closed, and I was given a table at the back of the restaurant in what could only be described as an overflow section. The bar’s terrace was open and operational. Why was the restaurant terrace closed? As it was too late to cancel and make a reservation at an alternative restaurant, I proceeded with dinner. But I would not have eaten at the restaurant in the first place if they had told me the terrace would be closed that evening. There was no explanation for why the restaurant terrace was closed and the bar terrace was open.

2. Restaurant and bar cover charges and inaccurate charges. The hotel charges a per-person cover charge. The charge applies both in the restaurant and at the bar. The menu says the charge is 12 euros per person, which is outrageous. For two people eating dinner, that is an extra 24 euros. Please note cover charges are NOT gratuity charges. This is not a mandatory tip for the staff. Cover charges are a compulsory fee for sitting at a table. Even though the menu discloses a cover charge of 12 euros per person, I was charged 14 euros in the restaurant. Upon complaint at check-out, the cover charges were removed entirely. If you charge a cover charge, at least charge the correct amount. An incorrect charge of 2 euros per person per table is a significant error. How many guests do not notice being overcharged by 2 euros per person at every meal? I doubt most guests see that they are overpaying by 2 euros. So, the hotel is making a lot of extra money from the mistake.

3. Housekeeping. When I returned from dinner at 9:20 p.m. on the last night of my stay, I did not receive turndown service. Around 9:30 p.m. I called to address the issue with the duty manager. At the same time, a housekeeper came to my room and ENTERED the room WITHOUT knocking on the door. She came to provide turndown service. That is unacceptable for two reasons. First, turndown service should have been provided much earlier. Second, a housekeeper (or any hotel staff) should NEVER enter a guest’s name without knocking at least two or three times.

4. Guest privacy. In the bar and restaurant, multiple staff asked for my room number and name in front of other guests. This is a significant privacy issue. Someone could overhear the room number and charge fraudulent transactions to your room. Some could also gain access to your room by getting a duplicate key.

5. Keys. Speaking of keys, the hotel uses old-fashioned keys. The hotel asks guests to deposit keys with the concierge when leaving the hotel. This is a very old-fashioned practice. Unfortunately, it is a significant security issue. The keys have a physical room number on them, which means anyone can access your room if they receive your key by mistake or if your key is misplaced and found by someone else. Also, in theory, anyone can walk up to the concierge staff and just ask for the key to your room number. Concierge staff cannot possibly remember every guest by face and room number. The hotel must consider a better way to do this.

6. As I said earlier, I was upgraded to the Patron Suite. Yes, the décor is elegant. There is no question about that. However, the décor does not match the hotel’s grandeur and overall classic décor and atmosphere. Had I been given a choice of a standard room with a Grand Canal view and a Patron Suite, I would have chosen a standard room. I booked The Gritti Palace because I wanted the décor and atmosphere you would expect at a hotel dating to the 15^(th) century. Yes, the décor is elegant. The décor’s furniture and art are too modern — too contemporary for The Gritti Palace, especially compared to the rest of the hotel. The bad décor choices remind me of the former Westin in Venice that recently reopened as the St. Regis. During the renovation, the designers gave the hotel a generic modern décor that could be a St. Regis anywhere in the world. They removed all the charm and Venetian elements. The same is true with the décor of The Gritti’s Patron Suite. The décor of the Patron Suite could be the décor of a suite at a modern 5-star hotel in New York City or Hong Kong.

7. Beyond the décor of the Patron Suite, several things were poorly designed or were outright missing. There was only one trash can — a small trash can in the bathroom. There was no other trash can in the room. There was no clock on the nightstand. There were ZERO USB outlets anywhere in the room. How can a suite that sells for US$10,000 per night not have a single USB outlet? Similarly, there was a lack of accessible electrical outlets. I could only find TWO accessible electrical outlets to charge devices. That is unacceptable in the year 2025.

8. No butler service. While the concierge and bellmen staff were excellent, there were no butlers for guests staying in the most expensive rooms and suites. You do not get complimentary coffee or soft drinks to make up for the lack of an in-room coffeemaker. The Gritti Palace said in-room coffeemakers in Venice are illegal, although the Aman offers in-room coffeemakers. So, if coffeemakers are unlawful, how does Aman offer coffeemakers? At $10,000 per night, I think complimentary soft drinks from the mini-bar are expected.

At check-out, the Front Desk offerede 45,000 Bonvoy points for the issues I experienced. I declined because I do not need more Bonvoy points. I just asked for the cover charges to be removed and the wine at breakfast to be comped. They also offered a replica of their beautiful key fobs free of charge.  

All things considered, would I return? Absolutely. The Gritti Palace is an excellent hotel. However, there are several excellent hotels in Venice. The only advantage The Gritti Palace has is its history and the décor. But like I said, the décor in my suite was not befitting. The nearby St. Regis, also a Marriott hotel, offers a comparable 5-star experience with significantly cheaper rates. The Aman is also priced equivalent to The Gritti Palace. There are also several independent 5-star hotels in Venice. If Marriott Bonvoy points or Marriott Bonvoy benefits are unimportant, compare prices before booking The Gritti.",7,1744814110.0,marriott,6,0.77,False

This happened a year ago when I used to work at a hotel near a tourist atraction.

As usual I was checking in some people. it wasn't busy so it was quite relaxing. A particular group of older fellows walk in to check, I get them quite often so I greet them and chat a bit. After a few minuters, a typical looking karen walks in. I already get annoyed but I don't show it, altho I am no the type of person to raise my voice I did get louder when this karen had the **audacity** to push one of the old ladies to the side and call her and old hag.

I tell her to apoligize, she refuses and ""whatever""'s me. she then goes up to me and say ""Listen here lower class employee, I need a room for four this instance."" I reply with a frown and a stern tone. ""Do you have a reservation?"". She says the name of her reservation and I notice that the brat infront of me is none other than my cousin. 

I give her the key to her room and she walks away. I help the old lady and apoligize for the karen's behavior. After giving her a free coffee I go back to my desk and continue work. after around an hour another employee ends my shift and they take over. that same night I go back to that hotel becouse and employee had to call out of work to take over their shift. 

I had the pleasure of seeing karen again. I see her with a bag full of stolen items walk out with full confidence. I stop her and ask her what she's doing. She just shrugs and dares to say ""You're family. It's your responsibility to pay for the things I want. Something just snapped in me and I take the bag, throw it outof reach and grab her by the wrist. I call security and they take her out of the building.

Not only did I get rid of an annoying family member I also got a raise and boosted confidence. Turns out she had to pay a hefty fine for attempting to steal and harrasment.",9,1744814039.0,AmITheJerk,18,0.62,False

I would love something like this but without the plastic. 

We make 6-10 cups of coffee at once so we need something bigger than most of the insulated carafes I'm finding. It also needs to be insulated because we drink it over the course of about 2 hours. 

We don't grind our own coffee grounds, we're not looking to make fancy coffee or have specific tastes. I just want something simple, effective, easy to use, and easy to clean. We're tired and busy in the mornings and don't want extra steps which is why we've been using a traditional drip machine.

I didn't think it would be so hard to find something like this. Any recommendations?

I've lived in the area for a little over 16 years, and while I love many things about Fairfax, I've consistently struggled with the tap water quality.

Drinking more than a glass or two can make me feel a bit off, and over the years, I've had to replace multiple coffee makers due to buildup. I also regularly notice residue on faucets, which makes me wonder what kind of wear and tear this might be causing to our plumbing and appliances.

So I wanted to ask — has anyone here installed a whole-house water filtration system?

We'd like to put floating shelves to put coffee cups on, probably aligned right and only spanning 60cm (the entire width is 90cm).

We'd like help with two things. Firstly: what goes behind the shelves? I'd kinda like to use a neat wallpaper and am strongly attracted to [these](https://www.worldofwallpaper.com/au/theme/geometric-and-motif/honeycomb-bee-wallpaper-charcoal-holden-13081.html) delightful bees.

Secondly: how many shelves should we install, and what height? Is it worth having the lowest one span the shelves so we can put something tall and decorative on the left (with the upper shelves only going partially across?)

Some other space details: 

* The countertop is Dekton [Laurent](https://www.cosentino.com/en-au/colours/dekton/laurent/) and the equipment at the bottom is a permanent fixture
* The upper cabinets are 39cm deep
* We're strongly considering pointing a spotlight at the space and using that as our night lighting when the kitchen is ""offline""
* That clock can go (or stay)
* There's no need to accommodate wine glasses; we're installing a bar elsewhere in a year or so
* If one more person suggests I paint *anything* white to ""Brighten up the space!"" they will never find that dreary loser's body

The energy has been super consistent: replies every few minutes, lots of laughing, sharing pics and videos from our day, and we both say goodnight to each other each night. When either of us takes a while to reply, we usually apologize, which I take as a good sign.

We met up for a coffee + park walk, and it went great. Conversation flowed easily, we walked the park multiple times, sat and talked for hours. When we were going home, she insisted I take the tram with her, then stayed on *past her stop* just to get off with me, then waited for her tram back. That felt like a clear sign she wanted to spend more time together.

We’re planning to hang out again soon for something a bit more serious like a movie and dinner. I haven’t made any direct moves yet, other than liking her posts she posts of herself on her close friends stories, but I’m thinking of slowly showing more intent next time and maybe bringing up how I like the vibe between us.

Only thing is, today she had a presentation and after I wished her good luck, she just said “thank you” without keeping the convo going, which made me overthink a bit but I know she’s genuinely busy with college right now and it might just be a morning thing.

Overall, this whole dynamic feels really refreshing compared to my last experience where I felt like I was constantly chasing so I'm not used to things being ""this easy"". I just don’t know if she sees this as something romantic or just enjoys talking as a friend.

This isn’t a complete list or anything, just stuff that worked for me, and maybe some of it will help you too!

https://preview.redd.it/xzu733wvh7ve1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1fd210b2d16a6fe7b3128f14005bc83bfb1e71c

✔ **Check the Publication Date & Author**

Ever picked up a super famous classic novel in your target language only to find it full of unfamiliar, old words or complex structures you might not use in everyday conversation? Yeah, me too. Reading very old books, even the famous ones, can sometimes teach you outdated language or sentence structures that sound strange today.

*My tip:* Try sticking to more modern books if your main goal is learning practical, everyday language. Books from the last few decades (like the 80s/90s onwards) are usually a good bet. Be a bit more careful with texts from the mid-20th century or earlier unless you’re specifically interested in that historical period or literary style.

Also, think about whether the language you're learning has significant regional variations or dialects (like Spanish, Arabic, German, Chinese, etc.). If you have a specific variety you want to focus on (e.g., Latin American Spanish vs. European Spanish, Egyptian Arabic vs. Levantine Arabic), consider choosing authors from those regions. It’s not always crucial, especially at the beginning, but it can help tune your ear and understanding to the specific type of language you aim to learn.

✔ **Listen While You Read (Sometimes)**

This seriously helps with pronunciation and rhythm! Try getting the audiobook (if available) for a book you’re reading in your target language and listen along as you follow the text.

It definitely slows down your reading speed, so you probably won’t want to do it for every book. But doing it occasionally is amazing for catching pronunciation nuances and intonation patterns you might otherwise miss. I was shocked at how many common words I was 'hearing' wrong in my head until I started doing this!

✔ **Don’t Try to Learn EVERY Single New Word**

When I first started reading seriously in my target language, I was super enthusiastic and tried to look up and save every unfamiliar word I saw (I used the Anki app). My flashcard list got HUGE really fast, and honestly, it was just overwhelming and not very effective.

*My advice:* Focus on learning the more common words first. Look up words you don’t know, sure, but maybe only add words to your study list if they seem important for understanding the text, you see them repeatedly, or they are generally high-frequency words (some dictionaries or language learning tools indicate word frequency). You’ll naturally pick up many rarer words through context as you read more. Don’t stress about memorizing absolutely everything!

✔ **Read the Real Deal (Original Versions)**

As soon as you feel reasonably comfortable (perhaps around the A2 level on the CEFR scale or higher), try to read original books written for native speakers of the language, rather than versions specifically ""adapted"" or ""simplified"" for learners.

Reading simplified readers can sometimes feel a bit… artificial? Like you’re not experiencing the language in its natural flow and complexity. It’s like driving a car in a simulator versus driving a real car on the road — similar, but not quite the same authentic experience.

Of course, find books that match your current level. Maybe start with Young Adult (YA) fiction (a category available in many languages) or books known for clearer, more direct language before diving into complex literary novels. (Though, I admit some adapted books can be useful, especially for absolute beginners).

✔ **Try Writing Things Down By Hand**

Okay, this sounds old-school in the age of keyboards and apps, but hear me out! Get a physical notebook and pen and actually write down new words, interesting phrases, or example sentences you want to remember from your reading.

Even if you primarily use digital flashcards, studies suggest the physical act of writing helps activate more parts of your brain involved in memory consolidation. It makes the word or phrase feel more ‘important’ to your brain because you’re spending more time and physical effort on it, compared to just quickly typing or clicking “add” on a screen. Give it a try!

✔ **Make Reading a Daily Habit**

You’ve probably heard this one before, but it really works! Try to make reading in your target language a small part of your daily routine. Find a specific time that works for you — maybe during your morning coffee, on your commute, during your lunch break, or before bed.

I used to work late and would go straight to bed mentally buzzing. I started forcing myself to read a chapter of a book in my target language for 15–20 minutes before sleep just to switch off my brain from work mode. It helped me relax and consistently improve my language skills. Years later, it’s a habit I rarely skip! Consistency is key.

As time went by, we had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, I found out — according to her — that she had autism.

Our conversations were often one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She used to say I was treating her differently after she told me about her autism. She also told me her ex had abandoned her, and that she had been seeing another guy who ended up replacing her.

One day, after I got mugged, I almost lost her number. Strangely enough, she didn't seem to care much, and told me she wouldn’t message me unless I texted her first. She used to talk about her cats and how her nephews also had autism. I remember she got really angry when her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex.

After some time, I invited her to the movies, since she often said we never went out. At first, she refused, saying she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed. However, the next day she told me, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?”

Despite that, we did go to the movies. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a couple. She never let me look at her phone and was always very guarded. She didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me a chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. Once we got there, she said she felt embarrassed and didn’t want the lights on. I told her I didn’t mind, but she quickly became defensive and her mood changed. Afterward, we went back home.

Before that, we had spent some time at the park. When it was time for her to leave, I offered to walk her home, but she always made it pretty clear she didn’t want me to meet her family. I walked her home anyway and then returned to mine.

There was another episode when her sister dropped her off at my place. I commented that we barely went out because she was always making excuses, and she got really mad at me that day.

Another time we were playing a game, I criticized it and she got upset and stopped playing. Despite that, she brought me a chocolate, we spent time together, and shortly after, she mentioned breaking up again.

She once invited me to a party, but kept saying she wasn’t going anymore, and later changed her mind again. I got frustrated and asked if she didn’t want me to go with her. I told her I would go and asked if I could arrive early, but she clearly told me to only come at 6 PM. I ended up getting there earlier, and her sister saw me on the street and invited me upstairs. We later went to her friend’s party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend.

At some random moment during the party, she suddenly said, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?” After the party, we went to her place and she asked me to sleep over, but I ended up going home.

After all these ups and downs, I called her and broke up. She started crying and blocked me. Later she told me I had pushed her to the mental health center (CAPS) and that I had taken away her happiness. Not long after, she texted me saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me she was just looking for her friend’s ex. In the end, I told her I loved her, and she replied saying it would pass and mentioned that she had gone somewhere and wished I had been there.

Some time later, she called and invited me to her mother’s birthday party, but I didn’t go. Her mom called me, asking if I loved her, and then even invited me over for coffee. We started talking again, but at some point, she told me her dad was furious with me. I felt really bad and ended up venting online.

She found out about it, came to me saying I had deceived and used her, and told me she acted that way because she was insecure and autistic. She said she prayed for me every day, blocked me, and disappeared.",2,1744813266.0,AITAH,30,1.0,False

He suggested we get plants, we got 2 aloe vera plants and hes watered them once in 6 months (only because i asked him). They can die for all i care anymore.

an image of yourself—a pale reflection of what you thought you would be.  
Amidst the mess, you are at the epicenter of a whirlwind.

We talked, we shared, and we plans while you were in your country. Now, you are here, why everything just fall back? It's like, you don't know us? We are like stranger to you? We cleared our weeks schedule, just because you are here. We waited when you are free and we could start gossiping, talk about lives, bond together. We understand that you have limited days here, bond with family and relatives. But what about us, your friends? We not asking for an overnight or outing, but at least we eat outside, coffee or an hours to cope up/bond. Soon you will leave again, and doesn't know when to come back. We aren't sure if that time, are we all available for you? Will that time make us disappear our friendship or this is our sign that our friendship will end? ",1,1744812978.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Do we break no contact?","My boyfriend’s mom’s (technically not my mother in law but we’ve been together for 3.5 years close enough) mother just passed away, his grandmother. My boyfriend wasn’t super super close with her but he is sad she died. The problem? His family lives a seven hour flight away and I have no idea if I should go to the memorial. He is having trouble deciding if he should even go as it breaks no contact in a pretty massive way. 

His mother and I do not speak because of some pretty awful things she said about me a year ago. Since then I have not spoken to her once. She sends gifts I throw them in the trash and do not say thank you. She has been disrespectful of me since I met her the first time. One example, she left me waiting on her at a coffee shop the second time we ever met for four hours because she was mad at my boyfriend and didn’t want to leave the house. 

Last year I got in an argument with his father. I was sitting at a restaurant and told my boyfriend’s father something that upset him. He waited a few days until we were supposed to get in a car together to go somewhere, unbeknownst to me this drive had no cell service or even any businesses it was just us and the cows basically and he spent that two hours screaming at me and cursing at me literally would scream at me if I tried to say anything. I never did anything about it, I should’ve called the police but a month later he called my boyfriend’s mom giving her a very different version of the truth (his parents are divorced) and that is when this whole thing got started. 

She called my boyfriend saying some very nasty things about me insinuating that I would try and baby trap him (I would NEVER, also it isn’t baby trapping if both people are discussing having a baby that is simply.. having a baby), she said I get everything I was and wanted to destroy their relationship so he was allowing me to get it, said that I was “rude” and “did not know how to speak to her,” and she called my boyfriend saying he needed to fly to their home state to have “family conversations” that did not include me, and he needed to be prepared to stay for awhile trying to break us up essentially. 

My real issue is this, after that my boyfriend never speaks to his dad and sends a sign of life test once a month to his mom that’s it. His mom has sent gifts and I mainly think it’s a tool of manipulation she has been disrespectful to me from the beginning and clearly was harboring resentments of her own having nothing to do with my issues with his father but she was lied to. My boyfriend and I never told her want happened, she never asked. My boyfriend was clear he would not be calling, texting or coming to see his mom until she apologized and promised never to speak about me again. She outright refused saying she would always voice her opinion. 

Well then his grandmother died and he wants to go to her memorial which I get. His mom has invited me multiple times and offered to pay for a hotel room for me actually. I don’t want to see her. But I also know that my boyfriend doesn’t want to entirely cut his mom off and for as long as they have a relationship by proxy I have one with her as well. For as long as they speak I might have to see her and it doesn’t matter what I do she will never get over I’m sure the fact that I chose not to go. 

I feel she thinks this is her in back into a normal relationship. I view this as simply going to remember his grandmother and nothing more. But how do we approach this. Do I go? Does my boyfriend go? No I cannot control if he goes but he wants input. 

Currently we have discussed my boyfriend calling her and trying to set some boundaries depending on how that convo goes dictates if I go or if he goes at all. But I need some other opinions. ",10,1744812941.0,motherinlawsfromhell,8,0.92,False
