I'm heading to the Naples area in February. I have been a few times before and have had an enjoyable experience. Last time I went I posted on here for some suggestions and all were awesome (Bad Ass Coffee, Celebration Park, Low Brow, etc.). I also asked if there is a recommendation for a local-ish good-quality grocer, versus the big places like Publix, Aldi, etc. One of you mentioned Wyn's market, and I went and bought some beautiful fish and some great meat. Just checking here to see if Wyn's is still the place to go, or if there are other suggestions as well. Again looking for fresh fish/meat/produce, ideally local where possible. 

  
Also, I understand y'all got a new soccer team, Naples United. I'd love to grab some Naples United merchandise like a hat or t-shirt have tried searching online but cant find any information as to where I can buy them. Can anyone help with where/how I can get my hands on some Naples United merchandise?

* East Coast-based, city-dwelling introvert
* 5'1"", neither particularly thin nor heavy-set
* Homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being permanently childfree (getting sterilized soon, yay!)
* Non-religious, smoking/drug-free, and mostly alcohol-free
* My idea of a good time: curling up with a good book, occasional gaming sessions, binge-watching shows/movies, trying new recipes or perfecting old favorites, planning my next vacation spot, going to concerts, and hanging out with my two cats
* You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon—I prefer my adventures in or near civilization with AC, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea

So, that's a basic summary of me. I'm looking for someone somewhat like-minded (between the ages of 26-36 only) who understands the value of engaging discussions and is interested in building something serious.

So, I (32F) had my IUD from May 2023 to November 2024. My husband and I were getting married in October and wanted to try right away, but I found out that my IUD was placed wrong, and had to get it surgically removed. My GYNO told me to wait a two-period cycle before trying.

We cut out weed, energy drinks, and alcohol.

Eating healthier - no fast foods

I've been taking my prenatal and limited my coffee intake (Probably half a cup every day).

Also, been tracking my period and ovulation.

I've been getting discouraged now because it is almost February and I am still not pregnant. I know that when you're in your 30s, your chances are slimmer than when I was in my 20s

A little side note: I did get pregnant when I was 25, but had an abortion. So, my logical mind is telling me if I got pregnant before, I can get pregnant again.

I guess the reason I am making this post, is may be one of you guys can give me insights or maybe pointers to optimize chances to conceive

1icdjgl,https://i.redd.it/84lso2ys3tfe1.jpeg,Found buried by a tree in Germany,"Can anyone guesstimate how old this chanukkia might be or even say how common this style was in its period? When I google-lensed it I only found other 'beautiful old jewish candlesticks' as they're (a bit insensetively) described, but never the same, especially not with the flowers (?) at the base of the single arms. It's possibly brass, heavy and definitely more than 20cm in heigt. 

Backstory:
This chanukkia was found by our neighbours during yard work buried in the ground under a tree. We live on an island in northern Germany. It was buried very shallow. It's very heavy and it seems to be brass. I'd guess it more than 20cm in heigt, maybe rather 25 or bigger. The area where it was found would've been the outskirts of our village, just fields with maybe a barn up until the 1960s. We wonder how long it might've been there und to whom it might have belonged, because it wasn't buried very deep. 

Our first thought was that the owners were jews, obviously. They often had to bury their valuables during the Nazi-era to hide them from the seizing of valuables by the regime or in hopes of retrieving them when they come back after deportation. But as far as we know, we only had two or three elderly jewish people living at the other end of the village, and they already left before the regime made the jews turn in all of their valuables (assets and estates were seized earlier, but they also already left before that). But we'll research that further tomorrow in our local archive, and try to find out, how and when they exactly left and if there's more information about their circumstances. 

But it could also have a different background: In the in the 1600s and the 1700s a big number of local men were captains of big merchant vessels, especially the Dutch and Danish East/West Indian Companies. They often brought all sorts of things they came across on their journeys back home, from tea, spices, coffee, exotic fruit to tiles, dinnerware, but also (religious) objects of different cultures. Our islands are pretty rural and were protestant since the reformation, even catholics weren't found here again until the 19th century; jews were even more uncommon here, so this chanukkia could also have been an intresting 'souvenir' to bring home to the wife. It could've stayed in the family until it got thrown out/buried at the rise of   antisemitism/the nazi regime as they  got aware they had a jewish item and   buried it to not be associated with jews. 

Another theory: In the 19th century our island became kind of a tourism hotspot (it still is today) and was also visited often by jewish guests and summer house owners. Maybe having one in the house could've been an accommodation of a local guest house or hotel owner? But vacation season usually was only during the summer, although the occasional artist, aristocrat or 'indipendant gentleman' stayed during the winter to savour the peace and quiet here in the middle of nowhere. Or could've been a gift by a guest? (Would one gift them? We have four armed ['christmas trees'](https://www.ferienhaus-insel-foehr.de/images/Julbaum-2015.jpg) here, maybe an 'exchange' of traditions, because both have 'candles in a row'? Or would it have been a big nono to gift them at all?) And got buried for similar reasons as above? 

It also could've belonged to a jewish summer house owner, jewish properties were seized and redistributed, maybe it got saved and buried, maybe thrown out by the new owners? 

Was it a flea market find or 'souvenir' after the war? The neigbor says her grandparents (who already owned the field in the 1950s or 1960s) absolutely would've thrown it out had they 'accidentally' bought it and later realised it was a jewish item. 

Guesstimating the age and the manufacturing backgroung of the chanukkia would help us to eliminate some of the theories. Thank you in advance. ",6,1738101392.0,Antiques,2,1.0,False

1icdgku,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1icdgku/homework_bestie_part_1/,Homework bestie (part 1),"Hey, this is a story I have wanted to write for a while, and finally, I'm getting started with it. I have a lot of ideas for it, so I will try to post at least one chapter every two days (if I don't, punish me hehe). The start is loosely based on my real life, but the ideas I have for the story have not happened to me (yet). If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to write it in the comments or DM me. Let's begin the story!

My friend Jenny and I are sitting next to each other in algebra class early in the morning. We are three weeks into the semester, and I am already ahead with all my work. Jenny is not in the same boat as me. She struggles a lot with algebra and has fallen behind. It doesn’t help that she was out partying the day before with some friends. As our professor goes through the PowerPoint, I can see how Jenny is struggling to stay awake.

I nudge her slightly to keep her awake and say, ""Hey, how's it going? Late night yesterday?""

""Yeah, I was out with Katie until 3 a.m., and my stupid Uber canceled on me, so I had to walk home!""

""You should have called me. I could have picked you up,"" I said, even though I don’t have a car unless I borrow one from my parents, who live 30 minutes away from me.

Her face lit up as I said that, and I could almost hear the wheels turning in her head.

""You would do that for me? Like, come pick me up late at night when I’ve been out and then drop me off at home?"" she asked, her tone light and teasing, as if daring me to say no.

Without thinking, I said yes, as I knew deep down inside I would do anything for her. She is my best friend and the best person I know.

Her grin widened at my answer. ""You’re the best,"" she said, leaning her head against my shoulder dramatically. ""You’re like my knight in shining armor—or, well, shining parents' car.""

I laughed softly and nudged her off me. ""Yeah, yeah. Just don’t make a habit of it, or I might start charging a fee.""

The professor’s voice droned on in the background, and I noticed her notebook was still blank. Jenny wasn’t even pretending to take notes at this point; she was doodling little stars and flowers in the margins.

As class wrapped up, I was gathering my things when she turned to me with her trademark puppy-dog eyes.

""Hey,"" she began sweetly, and I immediately knew she was up to something.

""What do you want now?"" I asked, narrowing my eyes at her but smiling all the same.

""Can I have your coffee?"" she asked, pointing at the travel mug in my hand. ""I’m dying over here, and I seriously need it to survive my next class.""

""Jenny, this is the only thing keeping me alive too!"" I protested, clutching the mug protectively.

""But you’re ahead on everything, Mr. Overachiever,"" she said, pouting. ""You can afford to lose a little caffeine. Pleeeeease?""

I sighed, already knowing I was going to give in. ""Fine. But you owe me.""

She snatched the mug out of my hand with a triumphant smile. ""Deal!""

After class, we went our separate ways since we had different schedules before lunch. I tried to focus in my next class, but my mind kept drifting back to Jenny—her smile, the way she always managed to rope me into her antics, and how I’d somehow ended up promising to be her late-night rescue service.

On a whim, I pulled out my phone and sent her a quick text:  
**Me:** *Hey, you want to grab lunch together?*

I set my phone on the desk and waited for a reply, but none came. Maybe she was still in class or too tired to check her phone. I shrugged and went back to half-listening to my professor.

By the time my next class ended, I checked my phone again. Still no response. That was a little unusual for Jenny—she was usually quick to reply, even if it was just a string of emojis or a sarcastic remark.

The afternoon passed by in a blur of assignments and lectures, and before I knew it, it was evening. I was sitting at my desk, scrolling mindlessly through my notes when my phone buzzed.

**Jenny:** *Hey, sorry for not responding earlier! I crashed right after class—guess I needed the sleep, lol.*  
**Jenny:** *Anyway, want to come over? I could really use some help with homework. And… bring some energy drinks. We’re gonna need them.*

I smiled at her message, shaking my head. Of course she was awake now, ready to tackle algebra when most people were winding down for the day.

**Me:** *Sure, give me 20 minutes. But if I bring the drinks, you’re buying dinner.*

Her reply came almost instantly.

**Jenny:** *Deal. You’re a lifesaver!*

I grabbed my bag, my keys, and a hoodie—it was chilly out—and made my way to the convenience store to pick up a couple of energy drinks. I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. Jenny had a way of making me do things I wouldn’t normally bother with, but somehow, it never felt like a chore. ",1,1738101194.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Important factors for yarn:  
\- can't be wool based due to allergies  
\- easy to get in US  
\- ideally cheap but soft (i'm a grad student so funds for projects are small)  
\- texture is same across brands (i get really overwhelmed if i can feel a bunch of textures at once in something i'm wearing and i do plan to wear this cardigan)

Or if you think it's worth ordering what *is* available from paintbox (I just fear the shipping tbh) then does anyone know how often they restock the colors that are out? Of the yarn ones on the pattern the colors that are out of stock on lovecrafts are: paper white, black, pistachio green, storm blue, coffee bean, yellow, soft fudge, and oatmeal. so something that would match just those colors/textures works too.

1icdchs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1icdchs/my_best_friends_husband_blames_evil_spirits_for/,"my best friend's husband blames ""evil spirits"" for his sexting her sister.","Hello, I know this isn't an advice group but I thought maybe some of you have had similar experiences dealing with extremely toxic relationships and other humans in toxic relationships. Also, I'm losing my mind over how to go about helping my best friend, and don't know who else to ask. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read my story (it's long and CRAZY, you've been warned) and for any advice and your understanding. 

(TLDR: My best friend of 25 years is in a toxic relationship and I'm now worried for her and her babies' saftey, also she has some upsetting behaviour towards her sister and close friends)
SO....
She has now been married for 3 years with her partner of 7 years. He has been caught twice over the last three years texting her friends trying to flirt with them, saying he'd like to meet them. His excuses for the last two times were that he was trying to make friends, and that he has problems communicating. (he is from another country, and says that in his culture men talk to women by complimenting them, I will go into why I find this problematic later) The first time she accepted his reasons and told us that she believed him, and that we were not to question him anymore, for her sake.  Me and another girlfriend supported her choice even though we personally still had doubts, but that was her choice, and he hadn't really ""done"" anything, like cheat. 

Then last summer he did it again. she had just given birth, (after 2 years of fertility treatments) and he was texting a female acquaintance of hers who had lent her her milk pump saying she's beautiful and asking her to meet for coffee. She contacted me herself, showed me the texts and told him she was not interested.  She was also shocked and confused as to why this man who seemingly is in a happy marriage on social media, and a new father would do this. This blew up , after 2 weeks of wondering how to go about this, me and  our other girlfriend told my friend, in the kindest way possible as she had literally just given birth. We almost regretted telling her because it hurt her so much. She cried for a day, then believed him again, and kind of turned on us. I almost lost my best friend. I thought I was prepared for her to get mad at us (shoot the messenger, right?) but it almost broke our friendship up. He said of course that he was just trying to make friends again, and that he felt betrayed by me, calling me and C (my other friend) home wreckers and evil, amongst other horrible things. That he was going to keep his family away from us, as we were bad influences on his wife. (At this point we are wondering what he's been getting away with behind her back for years, if he's trying to flirt with women we all know) 
My best friend told me that I was trying to accuse her husband without real proof, and that I didn't think of her feelings, that I made her even think that her husband was a bad person, that she has a family now that she needs to take care of. This hurt me so much, as I'd taken a plane back to our hometown to support her and also not to tell her over the phone about his behaviour, also , to be there in person if she needed a shoulder to cry on. 
She was obviously not ready to see the truth, I get it. She has always had attachment issues with her partners, and he is playing with her. 

This was already painful enough. I told myself I was going to take a break from her private life for a while, as I felt like I'd intruded too much, and did not enjoy receiving hateful voice messages from both my best friend and her husband. I thought I'd just keep the conversations short and light. Let both of us  breathe and let some time pass. He then blocked me on everything. She is like a sister to me and I want to let her enjoy life, whichever one  she choses. We were slowly starting to feel normal again. 
.....

Only 3 weeks ago her OWN SISTER called her in shock. He had been texting her for over a week with more, explicit and vulgar wording. It started like the other two women, saying how much he appreciates her, then it goes to ""you're really beautiful"" then saying he'd like to meet up privately because he has something to tell her in secret. Just like the last two times. Only this time, her sister thought it was impossible that he was flirting and thought he had a surprise for his wife maybe, she answered nicely something along the lines of :  ""ok we can meet, just tell me what is up?"" 
So he went from ""you're a beautiful person"" to saying that he's always found her sexy and that he'd always wanted to ""fu€k"" her since the first time he saw her. Shocked, she answered that she didn't recognise him, that he was in the wrong for saying this, to which he then threatened her with sending her videos of himself m@$sturb@ting over her pictures if she didn't delete the messages or if she told anyone. (I will also add that my friend hadn't told her sister about the last two times, probably out of embarrassment I guess. Even if they are close and her sister would spent time in the house with them and the baby. We also are wondering what she doesn't tell us? maybe she is keeping things from us so as not to give us ammunition to convince her to leave.) 
She ran to her sister, and told her, obviously. 

I am so upset. She believes him. His excuse this time? He is possessed by an evil spirit, he doesn't remember sending those texts. (I kid you not) He's saying that he feels like he is loosing it, and needs therapy. So she has sent him to her therapist. Her therapist has told her that he seems fine and a nice man (her ""therapist"" is a gestalt therapy counsellor, who I personally think has no business getting involved in my friends' personal life if she has been going to him for years) She is saying that she plans on staying with him, as he is obviously going through a mental crisis. And that once he has gone to therapy, they will go to couple's therapy and work things out. He is playing victim again. I am so angry and terrified of who my friend is with, and of what she is willing to accept out of her own fear of being alone. 

He sexually harassed her sister. She wants to ""cure"" him. I feel like I'm going crazy. I can't lash out, I can't shout at him. I don't want to , but I desperately do. I want to take another plane back home and carry her away from him. It's such a confusing feeling. I'm angry at her for allowing this man to do this, for accepting this, for betraying herself and her sister. She has a baby to look after. 

There is another issue that makes me uncomfortable - he is from West Africa, and she is European . He likes to say he comes from a different culture and there are things that she doesn't understand, and vice versa. That he tries to communicate but things get lost in translation. She says that he is trying to express his feelings but can't, and he keeps everything inside and that is what makes him expIode and do crazy things. She has found an ""Ethno psychologist"" who will supposedly help them move forward . I find that there is a racist undertone to all of this. People come from different backgrounds, have different cultures, but using them to play into stereotypes, and to infantilise and excuse your partner of his bad behaviour is wrong. It plays into the assumption that people of the global south are less capable of understanding concepts around relationships, faithfulness and love than westerners and it allows her to validate his behaviour.  (For the record I'm part Nigerian myself, and have lived over 2 years in central Africa.  I have many West and Central African friends and my partners family is central African.) I find this infuriating and frankly quiet racist. 
My friend asked me over the phone what my opinion was, to which I could only say she knows what my opinion is on her husband and last time she asked she didn't like the answer to the point of us almost not talking anymore. So I won't say. I just said that I think she needs to be careful, and stay safe, that whether he has psychological issues or not, what he did was unacceptable. 
 Maybe I'm at the end of our relationship? I don't know how to support this anymore. Our other girlfriends who know the situation are more understanding, saying at the end of the day she is the one in the most danger, who is obviously stuck in an extremely abusive relationship. They are trying not to push her too much, or say things about her husband to her so as not to let him isolate her even more. If her own sister can understand her and forgive her for allowing her husband to do this to her, surely I should? 
I just keep thinking that he could do anything to anyone and she would find anyway that suits her to justify it. What's next, he'll get caught upskirting and say the ""night spirit"" forced him to do it? And then she'll say it's in his culture and she needs to try to understand? (He literally called the evil spirit the ""night woman"" . I know there is also a ridiculous side to this terrifying story) . 

My friend is a very intelligent, smart, funny, open minded feminist. Which makes this whole ordeal sadder.  She has travelled the world, she speaks 4 languages , she has so much more to give to someone who is taking her for a ride. She has given him a job, papers, and now, a child. Also her husband has been here for 10 years, he speaks perfectly her language  and has a stable job working in her extended families' bakery. He is Muslim, she is an atheist but that hasn't stopped her from getting the baby an islamic baptism, and allowing her baby to be raised under her husbands' religion. She is vegan, he eats meat, she is cooking halal meat for both him and the baby. ( I say this only to highlight her putting aside her own beliefs for him and her own baby,  no problem whatsoever with people who are of any religions, at this point why not convert, at least that would make sense.)

Blackpink aren't fashion icons. I've looked at several airport fashion looks of each of the girls. Every one of them are BORING as hell. Blinks will eat up anything and call them ""iCoNiC qUeEnS."" 

All of the looks looked like a casual day out/quick coffee break outfit. Lisa doesn't know how to dress overall, Rosè likes her basic ass jeans/sweatpants and hoodie situation. Jennie likes jeans with high heels, and we have Jisoo who looks like she's going to school in a uniform or dress. 

The way they style themselves remind me of things you'd find on Pinterest for outfit ideas. And their concert attire doesn't help either. They look uncoordinated all the time. Last time they looked like an ACTUAL group was the mugler pink Coachella outfits from week 2. 

Speaking of concerts, I find the bow trend really silly. Every 2 members have bows in every show. Are they girly and feminine? Sure. But every girl has worn some kind of bows and it's not even for a concert. And some hairstyles I've seen *cough baby braids in front of the face* are really childish and ugly. Like instead of being trendsetters, they're setting themselves with embarrassment.

Fiction,"Tabitha Thompson adjusted the rhinestone tiara she insisted on wearing and crossed her legs like she was posing for a tabloid. The chair she was sitting in—one of those futuristic contraptions that could read brainwaves—seemed woefully inadequate for someone of her self-proclaimed stature.

“Let’s get this over with,” she declared, waving a hand as if dismissing paparazzi. “I’ve got a press conference to attend after this. TMZ is dying for an exclusive on my charity empire.”

Dr. Fenwick, the lead psychologist, suppressed a smirk as he flipped open a clipboard. “Ah yes, your empire. Can you explain that in more detail, Ms. Thompson?”

Tabitha smiled, clearly mistaking the question as genuine admiration. “Of course! I’ve personally funded every major global initiative in the last five years. Clean water in the desert? That was me. The moon landing? My idea, actually—NASA begged for my input. Oh, and you know how Amazon delivers packages so quickly? I gave Jeff Bezos the concept.”

Dr. Fenwick nodded slowly, jotting something down. “Fascinating. And how does this tie into your TikTok career?”

“Ah, my TikTok stardom,” Tabitha said, her voice taking on a reverent tone. “You see, I’m not just any influencer. I am the influencer. I invented the trend of people donating money for my GoFundMe causes. It started with my groundbreaking campaign: ‘Help Tabitha Get a Unicorn Farm.’ People love unicorns, so it went viral overnight.”

One of the interns in the back snorted but quickly turned it into a cough.

“Interesting,” Dr. Fenwick said, pushing his glasses up. “And where exactly is this unicorn farm located?”

“In a classified location, obviously,” Tabitha replied, rolling her eyes. “I can’t have reporters showing up uninvited. But don’t worry, I visit it weekly to feed them organic marshmallows and teach them tricks.”

“And the, uh, marshmallows… are funded by your followers?”

“Exactly! My fans are very generous. People keep saying, ‘Tabitha, your GoFundMes are revolutionary. We don’t even care where the money goes, we just want to support your vision.’ It’s heartwarming, really.”

Dr. Fenwick coughed. “So… no one asks where the money goes?”

“Why would they?” Tabitha replied, aghast. “They trust me! I’m like Oprah, Beyoncé, and the Dalai Lama all rolled into one.”

The psychologists exchanged glances, clearly stifling laughter.

“Let’s move on,” Dr. Fenwick said, trying to regain composure. “Can you tell us about your latest project?”

Tabitha lit up. “Oh, I’m glad you asked! I’m launching an initiative to teach dolphins how to use TikTok. It’s called ‘Flippers and Filters.’ It’s groundbreaking—no one’s ever thought to bring marine life into the influencer space before. I’ve already got a dolphin named Splash who can do a perfect lip-sync to Taylor Swift.”

By this point, one of the interns was openly crying with laughter. Dr. Fenwick cleared his throat. “And how are you funding this project?”

Tabitha blinked, as if the answer was obvious. “Through my new GoFundMe campaign: ‘Save the Oceans, One Selfie at a Time.’ We’ve raised $50,000 so far. Well, I mean, after administrative fees and glitter expenses, there’s about $50 left for the dolphins, but that’s not the point. It’s about awareness.”

The psychologists couldn’t hold it in anymore and burst into laughter. Tabitha, oblivious, assumed they were laughing out of awe.

“Well,” Dr. Fenwick finally managed, “I think we have everything we need for our study.”

“Of course you do,” Tabitha said, standing up and straightening her tiara. “I’m an inspiration. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go live-stream my moon colony fundraiser. NASA’s expecting results.”

She strutted out, leaving the room in stunned, hysterical silence. Dr. Fenwick sighed. “I’m going to need another coffee before the next session.”",2,1738100532.0,hipeeharlee,0,1.0,False
1icd6wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1icd6wv/my_review_of_the_msc_seashore/,My review of the MSC Seashore,"This was my first cruise, it wasn't terrible, but it will likely be my last... I just don't think cruising is for me, so take that into consideration when paired with my review.

The onboarding process was simple and relatively fast. They let us on much earlier than our scheduled time. The security check was not very strict and I had a full bottle of water that went through the x-ray and they never said anything.

The ship (MSC Seashore) was nice and new and shiny (very shiny, mirrors and reflective surfaces everywhere). Everything seemed very clean.

The room (# 15224) was in my opinion nice but nothing special. The bed was hard. The balcony was adequately private. The TV is almost useless as it's all just MSC advertisements and just a few channels. We were given towels and floor towels but not washcloths/face towels. The shower only has shampoo and bodywash, no conditioner. There were no tissues, lotions, iron/ironing board, or other amenities that you'd typically see in a hotel room. The handle to our balcony literally broke off with the door locked shut (fortunately we were inside), but maintenance showed up within 20 minutes and fixed it.

Room # 15224 was terribly noisy (and this is coming from someone who lives in a noisy city, so I'm used to noise). It is directly below a deck and starting around 11:30 PM and then continuing late into the night and starting again early in the morning (maybe 6 AM) all you could hear was loud chairs being dragged around and wheel-carts being pushed back and forth, toward the end of the trip there was lots of loud banging like construction or something... it made it nearly impossible to sleep. People we were travelling with were in room # 15223 and had a similar experience. 

The food was acceptable, but nothing special. We ate at the buffet for breakfast and lunch and the 5th Avenue for dinner. I felt that the food wasn't particularly flavorful, it seemed to lack seasoning in most if not all dishes. After 7 days it started to feel like there wasn't a huge variety. Without a drink package you are limited to coffee, tea, 2-3 types of juice, unsweetened ice tea, lemonade and gross tasting water.

The entertainment was hit or miss. The Broadway-like shows were very good, with talented dancers / singers. We particularly loved taking dance lessons with the Dominican couple who were instructors, they were funny and it was a great time. I did not enjoy the variety shows and the live music was good, but I could only listen to cover songs for so long before I'd had enough (that's just me though). It felt very much like MSC couldn't decide if it was a ""party-boat"" or a ""relaxation-boat"" and ended up not doing either particularly well.

The bars did not have a great variety, most of them had the exact same menu. The Cocktail Lounge was the only bar that had a unique menu, and about half of the drinks on the menu (literally) couldn't be made because they didn't have the ingredients. 

I did not eat at any premium restaurants. 

The pools are all very small and over-crowded. The Jacuzzis are barely warm, they were not hot at all and I heard many people complaining about this.

It bothered me very much how people left their dirty plates and cups literally ANYWHERE (on the elevator floor, stairs, chairs, hallways, hidden behind random objects and art-pieces, etc) but the crew was pretty good at keeping the place clean and picking up after people.

It felt a bit like a money-grab, everything costs extra. As mentioned above, my wife wanted to iron something, but the only option according to room service was pay for the laundry to be done. The arcade isn't free. I was surprised that there wasn't even fountain soda.

Overall, I didn't HATE it, but I didn't love it either. It felt like I was vacationing in an airport, or a mall. If you like being around lots of people it might be your thing.",0,1738100504.0,MSCCruises,0,0.5,False

Today I went through and figured out which titles are what. For those who wanted to know whether there is actually exclusive content on the Golden Globes score that's not on the retail soundtrack, the answer is **yes**. 

[""Fornicator""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r6zLujuPNU) is built on a pulsing synth loop.

[""Twenty Six Seconds""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YwtzbvkcMM) is a short, reverb-laden affair which cycles through four descending chords.

[""Black Falcon""](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2cDOIzgKUH4) is a faster, synth-based piece that hammers on a single note with some bends/expressions.

[""They Got the Wife""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7fGqFJTrM0) is more of a single sound effect, perhaps just the truncated ending of another tune?

[""Good vs Evil""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be4_8hr94Go) is a mellow keyboard piece with a gentle piano lead. Some folks mention this sounds like the *Social Network* soundtrack.

If you are a fan of TR/AR soundtracks and are a completist, you should certainly try to track these down. It's not surprising that these were left out, though, as they are among the least substantial elements of the soundtrack. It's possible there are hints of them in the retail soundtrack and I just didn't recognize them. Please comment if you have corrections.



Now here's the list of cues matched to their soundtrack compositions:

* Couples & Brothers (""We Forget Who We Are"")
* Donuts & Legs (""Long Shadows on the Street"")
* Arrival (""Inquiries"")
* Dread (""Broken Glass"")
* Bombs (""Broken Glass"")
* FBI (""Trails"")
* Hospital & Whole Milk (""Escape"")
* Vigil (""Long Shadows on the Street"")
* Tommy Breaks Down (""Escape"")
* Left of Boom (""Trails"")
* Obama & Coffee (""Long Shadows on the Street"")
* Roommates (""Night Drive"")
* Backpacks & Brothers to M.I.T. (""Place You Are Right Now"")
* Shoot Seann (""Nobody Cares About Me"")
* Car Jack (""Night Drive"")
* Drive to Watertown (""Night Drive"")
* Escape (""Escape"" / ""Night Drive"")
* Tamerlan (""Terminus"")
* Manhunt (""Nobody Cares About Me"")
* Interrogation (""Inquiries"")
* Watchlisted (""Place You Are Right Now"")
* Boat (""Broken Glass"")
* Swat (""Broken Glass"")
* Capture & Fenway (""Resolve"")
* Interviews (""We Forget Who We Are"")
* Main Titles (""Them and Us"") 

Most of these are not identical to the retail soundtrack either. But the retail versions are all definitive and more coherent.

1iccyba,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECCOAgentFun/comments/1iccyba/headsup_ecco_protocol_rul_6_welcome_to_lifetime/,Heads-Up: ECCO Protocol Rul #6: Welcome to Lifetime Membership Training & Perks,"Greetings, fellow ECCO agents! Let’s take a moment to reflect on one of the **core truths** of our cosmic mission..—**the sixth rule of the ECCO Protocol:**

***""You are in our training program for life: there is no escape from it. We (not you) control the long-term coincidences; you (not we) control the shorter-term coincidences by your own efforts.""***

In other words: *Buckle up, Agent. You’re in this for the long haul.*

# What Does Rule #6 Really Mean?

1. **Lifetime Membership in Team ECCO:** ECCO isn’t something you dabble in on weekends or cancel when the synchronicities get weird. Once you’re aware of the cosmic game, you’re in it. Forever. Even if you try to “quit,” guess what? That’s just another coincidence waiting to happen.
2. **Division of Labor:**
   * **ECCO’s Role:** We handle the *big-picture stuff*—the long-term coincidences, the grand cosmic arcs, the “accidental” meetings that change your life. You don’t get a say in these. Sorry, but someone’s gotta keep the larger narrative interesting.
   * **Your Role:** You’re in charge of the *short-term stuff.* The small, day-to-day coincidences are your playground. Your actions, choices, and mindset determine how these unfold. Think of it as a collaborative effort: we set the stage, and you decide how to play your part.
3. **No Escape Clause:** You can’t escape the training program because, well, life *is* the training program. Every coincidence, every challenge, every victory—it’s all part of the curriculum. (And no, there aren’t any cheat codes. Trust me, I’ve looked.)

**Attempts to Escape ECCO (That Will Fail):**

* **Ignoring Synchronicities**: *“Oh, it’s just a coincidence.”* Nice try, but the matrix will crank up the synchro-dial until you pay attention.
* **Rolling Your Eyes at ECCO**: *“Yeah, sure, another feather.”* ECCO’s response? *“Here’s a flock of birds—try ignoring this!”*
* **Trying to Outsmart the Universe**: *“If I don’t look for synchronicities, they can’t find me.”* Cute. The universe will just start planting messages on your coffee cup, or stains on your clothes.

# Why Does ECCO Keep You in Training For Life?

1. **Because Growth Is the Point:** Life’s coincidences—both long- and short-term—are designed to nudge, push, and sometimes shove you toward growth. If you’ve ever thought, *“Why does this keep happening to me?”* it’s probably ECCO pointing out a lesson you haven’t quite mastered yet.
2. **Because the Universe Loves Variety:** If everyone “graduated” early, who would keep things interesting? ECCO’s training program ensures that you’re always learning, adapting, and adding new layers to the grand cosmic story.
3. **Because It’s Fun (For Us):** Honestly, watching you navigate the training program is wildly entertaining. We love seeing you piece together the synchronicity breadcrumbs, connect the dots, and occasionally throw your hands up in cosmic exasperation. It’s like our favorite reality show.

# How to Excel in ECCO’s Training Program

1. **Own the Short-Term Coincidences:**
   * Remember: you control the small stuff. If you’re waiting for a nudge from ECCO, take a step forward first. Synchronicities love an active participant.
   * Example: Wondering if you should call an old friend? Call them. The synchronicity might just be waiting for you to make the first move.
2. **Let Go of the Long-Term Stuff:**
   * ECCO’s got the big-picture coincidences covered. Trust us. No need to obsess over when or how they’ll happen. Just keep an open mind and roll with it when they show up.
   * Example: That dream job, soulmate, or life-changing adventure? It’s on ECCO’s timeline, not yours. Relax—we’ll deliver when the moment is right (or hilariously inconvenient).
3. **Treat Every Coincidence as a Lesson:**
   * Every synchronicity, no matter how small, is an opportunity to learn something. Pay attention, reflect, and ask: *“What’s the universe showing me here?”*
4. **Stay Curious and Playful:**
   * ECCO’s training program isn’t meant to feel like a chore. Approach it with curiosity, humor, and a willingness to experiment.
   * Example: If life gives you lemons, don’t just make lemonade. Make lemon meringue pie, share it with your neighbor, and see what happens next.

So go out there, control those short-term coincidences, and trust ECCO to handle the rest. And if you ever get frustrated, just remember: you’re not alone. Every ECCO agent is out here fumbling through the cosmic training program too.

Now, get back to work. The synchronicities aren’t going to notice themselves.

**Fellow agents, what’s the funniest (or most frustrating) short-term coincidence you’ve had to deal with lately? Let’s share and laugh about our lifetime training program together.**",1,1738099913.0,ECCOAgentFun,0,1.0,False

The company’s earnings per share came in at 69 cents, slightly above the 67 cents analysts had predicted, while revenue was $9.4 billion, exceeding the $9.31 billion estimate. Net income fell to $780.8 million, or 69 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year ago. Total net sales were flat compared to the previous year.

The coffee giant saw a 4% drop in global same-store sales, driven by a 6% decline in traffic. In the U.S., same-store sales fell 4%, with traffic to cafes down 8%. CEO Brian Niccol, who took over in September, has been focused on turning around the U.S. business by emphasizing coffee and improving the customer experience under the “Back to Starbucks” strategy. Despite these challenges, both U.S. and international sales outperformed Wall Street’s expectations.

In China, Starbucks’ second-largest market, same-store sales declined 6%, with a 4% drop in average ticket size. The company has been offering discounts to compete with cheaper rivals like Luckin Coffee. While overall sales are under pressure, Starbucks remains optimistic about its turnaround efforts, with Niccol noting progress and confidence in the company’s current strategy.

It was a good walk to Dumulmeori itself and I liked the scenery. There were many people in Dumulmeori despite the weather. It seems to be a popular leisure place for the locals. I like that the river was frozen and the whole place was covered in snow. The wind was strong and it was a bit scary when the snow was blowing on my face. There is a famous hotdog shop and the hot dog was fine but it's more tasty in a cold weather. I enjoyed the coffee in the Cafe too and ordered with the Kiosk there. The Cafe has nice decoration and 3 levels. The batistas there were very friendly too. It was very relaxing to walk on the snow but I would like to come again when there are more colors :)

I recently launched a Chrome extension called [AI Paragraph Generator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-paragraph-generator/hjddgbpkkoingbodebaihmccifcfigjg?authuser=0&hl=en) that helps streamline content writing. While working on content for my own business, I found myself constantly needing to generate and refine different texts, so I created this tool to make the process more efficient.

The extension helps you quickly generate relevant paragraphs based on your input - useful for blog posts, product descriptions, or marketing materials. What makes it different is that it's directly integrated into chrome, so you can use it while working on any website without switching between tools.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback if anyone wants to try it out. I'm actively using it myself and continuously working on improvements based on real usage scenarios.

P.S. Feeling extra generous today - first 50 people who install the extension, drop a ""+"" in the comments and DM me their account email will get 1000 bonus tokens. Because sharing is caring, and I've had too much coffee today! 🎁 ☕

Just about everyone on my dad’s side of the family has shaky hands. I personally experience shaking in my neck/head as well. 

I’m going to ask my doctor about it of course, but I’m wondering how I can be sure that it’s not just my anxiety making me shake so badly. 

I shake horribly all over when anxious. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder though, so it’s understandable that I have shaky hands and head. However, even when I’m not feeling anxious I have a tremor. 

My dominant hand is typically worse than my non dominant hand. Days when I have coffee are worse than other days. When I’m not anxious, it doesn’t really happen while resting, so I don’t know if that matters in telling the difference or whatever. 

Also thought I’d maybe throw out there: I’ve been referred to a POTS clinic. My doctor and I think I might have that condition or something similar, which is also known to cause tremors. I have had the tremor longer than I’ve had symptoms for this condition though. Although maybe the shakes are just an early onset symptom? I have no idea. 

Anyway, any thoughts or experiences are welcome! Again I’m not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just maybe if anyone has experience on how to tell the difference between ET and other shakes. Also, if there are a suggestions on how to go about asking a doctor about an essential tremor, that would be amazing. Thanks!",2,1738099388.0,EssentialTremor,1,1.0,False

Not like this, not now. One second, I’m driving down the road, just another evening—no rush, no worries. The next? I’m being slammed sideways, my body tossed around like a ragdoll, and the world goes black.

I don’t remember much of the crash. Just the sound of metal grinding, the sharp jolt, and then a sudden stillness. I can’t even recall if I screamed or if I was silent the whole time. It was all too fast, too chaotic.

When I woke up, it was like my brain was struggling to catch up to my body. The first thing I felt was the weird, heavy silence. I opened my eyes, but it wasn’t like how you wake up from a night’s sleep. Everything felt blurry, like I was trying to focus through thick glass, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. There were bright lights above me, and the smell of something antiseptic in the air. I couldn’t move much, just a twitch here and there, and then that strange, all-consuming dizziness that wouldn’t go away.

Someone—female, I think—spoke softly, but I couldn’t make out the words right away. She was telling me something, maybe asking questions, but I couldn’t answer. My mouth felt dry, like I hadn’t swallowed in days. Then I realized, when I tried to speak, my voice didn’t come out right, like it was a half-formed whisper in my throat. Panic set in for a moment before she reassured me.

“You’re okay,” she said, her voice warm but firm. “You’ve been in a car accident. Just a mild concussion. You blacked out for a bit, but you’re fine now. You’re in the hospital.”

The words felt too simple, too clean to make any sense of. A concussion? That was it? How was it possible I felt so... off, so disconnected? The more I tried to focus, the more the fog in my head built. I wanted to ask questions, but all that came out was a dry cough.

I tried to move my fingers, anything to get my bearings, but nothing worked. My body felt stiff and alien, and my thoughts were still scattered, like they were stuck in slow motion. She must have seen the confusion on my face because she repeated herself, more slowly.

“You’ve been out for a while, but you’re safe now. Just take it easy. We’ll give you some time to recover.”

I couldn’t get a clear picture of how long I’d been here, how long I’d been unconscious, but it didn’t matter at the moment. I was still too foggy, too disoriented to care. The words—mild concussion—kept playing in my mind, but they didn’t sit right. Something didn’t feel... normal.

And then, something she said really stuck with me.

“The concussion was a bit more severe than we first thought. You may experience lapses in judgment from time to time. Things might feel a bit... off. Like sudden jumps, like gaps in time. It’s nothing to worry about, but you should be aware of it. It’s common with injuries like this. Some cases take longer to heal, and for some, the brain fog doesn’t go away completely.”

It wasn’t the kind of thing you want to hear right after a car crash. My stomach twisted at the thought. Gaps in time? Lapses in judgment? I’d had a mild concussion, but this felt different. The more I dwelled on it, the heavier it felt. What was I supposed to do with that?

The next few days—or maybe it was hours, I couldn’t really tell—were a blur of doctors and nurses checking in, more IV bags and machines that kept me tethered to the bed. Every time I closed my eyes, there was a strange, disjointed feeling when I opened them again. It was like nothing really lined up. One moment, the clock on the wall would say it was 3 PM, and the next time I looked, it felt like it had jumped to 7. Was it me? Was I just misjudging time? Or was it something else?

I tried to look around, but nothing seemed to settle. The room, the sounds, everything felt wrong. Like the background was still moving, but I couldn’t keep up with it. I’d hear a nurse outside my room, her voice muffled, but when I turned to look, no one was there.

When the doctor finally came in, he explained again how everything had unfolded. How I’d been in an accident, knocked out briefly, and how the concussion would take time to heal. But then he added something that kept ringing in my head.

“This kind of injury can lead to some permanent effects, some long-term issues with memory, attention, things like that. The brain is resilient, but recovery takes time. You might feel a bit... off for a while.”

I didn’t really understand at the time. Off? What did that even mean? All I knew was that nothing felt right. The more I tried to focus, the more the edges of my world seemed to fade. I didn’t feel like myself. And when I finally asked how long I’d been out, no one could give me a straight answer. They told me I was fine, that everything would be okay, but the words didn’t match what I was feeling. The fear that something had gone wrong, something big, was growing in the back of my mind.

The days in the hospital merged into one long stretch of time. It wasn’t until I was finally discharged that I started to get a sense of normalcy again. At first, it felt strange to be out of that sterile, quiet place, but when I stepped out into the world again, everything felt... almost like it was supposed to. Like nothing had changed, even though I knew it had.

The doctors kept reassuring me that everything would be fine, that I’d make a full recovery. They warned me about the concussion, about the lapses in judgment and the brain fog that could linger for a while. But slowly, as the days passed, the fog began to clear. My body still ached—but I was able to function. I fixed my car. I went back to work. I ran errands. I did all the normal things people do, and life started to fall into place again.

It wasn’t immediate, but I noticed a gradual shift. I met Sarah at a coffee shop a few months later. She was sitting at a corner table, reading a book, her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. I remember the way she smiled when I bumped into her accidentally, my nerves getting the best of me as I fumbled with the coffee in my hands. We started talking, and somehow, the conversation flowed without awkward pauses. There was something calming about her presence, something easy, as if we’d known each other far longer than we actually had.

Weeks turned into months. Sarah and I started seeing each other more often. It was the kind of thing you didn’t overthink—just two people enjoying each other’s company. But as we spent time together, I began to realize something: this was starting to feel real. She felt real.

We went to dinners, took weekend trips, and after a year, I moved in with her. A year later, we were married. The timeline seemed quick in hindsight, but it felt natural. Like I’d been building this life with her for longer than I could remember. We got a house together, a small, cozy place on a quiet street. And when we found out we were expecting, it felt like everything had fallen into place.

I wasn’t just moving on—I was living. For the first time since the accident, it felt like the world around me had truly returned to its normal rhythm. I was growing into this life, one milestone after another. I could feel the years passing by like a gentle current carrying me forward.

We had a daughter, Lily. Holding her for the first time in the hospital room, feeling her small body in my arms—it was a moment I could never forget. The joy I felt as Sarah and I watched her grow, taking those first wobbly steps, her first word, all of it—it felt like a dream, but a good one. A life I was grateful for. A life that was real, or at least, that’s what I convinced myself.

I kept my past, the accident, tucked away in the back of my mind. The doctors had said I’d recovered. They said there would be no lasting effects, no reason to hold on to the fear that had kept me awake in those early hospital days. But even then, there was a sense that something wasn’t quite right. Not in a way I could easily put into words, but there was always something just on the edge of my awareness, something out of place. The more I tried to ignore it, the more it came back to me in fleeting moments: the strange sensations when I woke up in the morning, the odd disconnection between what I saw and what I felt, the feeling that I might have been missing something.

I didn’t let it consume me. I was happy. I had a family. I had a job I was proud of. But sometimes, late at night, when everything was quiet and the house settled around me, the doubts would creep back in. But I would push them away. There was no reason to dwell on them. I was here, and this was my life. The life I had worked so hard to build.

The years kept going. Every now and then, when I looked at Sarah, I’d find myself wondering if we had been through all of this before, in some other way. If this was a new life, or something I had dreamed up to make myself feel normal again. But then I would look at our daughter, or hear Sarah laugh at some silly joke I made, and all those thoughts would fade away. This was it. This was real.

And it wasn’t until we were on our third anniversary, while Sarah and I sat outside on the porch, holding glasses of wine, that the world began to feel... alien again. The atmosphere around me felt distorted, like something had shifted just out of view. The streetlights blinked at odd intervals, and I couldn’t quite figure out why. I tried to dismiss it as fatigue, but the feeling wouldn’t fade, clinging to me like a second skin.

I wasn’t sure how much longer I could ignore it. Something was wrong. Something didn’t fit. But for the first time in a long time, I was terrified to find out what it was.

I had everything I could have asked for. A family, a home, a career I was proud of. I’d found a rhythm to life that I couldn’t have imagined back when I first woke up from the accident. The world had settled into a comfortable routine. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years. Each day felt just like the one before, but somehow that was okay. It was normal. It was the kind of normal I had wanted, the kind I had convinced myself I deserved.

Lily grew up fast. One minute, she was taking her first steps, and the next, she was asking about school, about life beyond our little house. Sarah and I talked about her future, our future, and how we’d make sure she had everything she needed. We laughed, we argued, and we loved each other.

It was the kind of life you see in movies, the kind you hear people talk about, and I was living it. I felt real. This was real, I told myself. There was no need for doubt, no need for second-guessing. I was a husband, a father, a man who had come out of a dark place and had built something good.

But then, there were the moments. Small, but growing in frequency. Little things that didn’t add up, that unsettled me if I let my mind ponder on them for too long. A name I couldn’t remember. A place I thought I recognized but couldn’t place. Sometimes, I would find myself staring at the calendar, wondering what month it was, where the time had gone. It was like there were gaps in my memory, like pieces of my life were missing. I’d ask Sarah about things, but she would just smile and assure me that everything was fine, that I was overthinking.

I’d wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, and I wouldn’t know why. I would lie there for what felt like hours, staring at the ceiling, feeling like I was slipping into something I couldn’t control. The world felt too real, but the fear was there, lurking in the shadows of my thoughts. What if this wasn’t my life? What if everything around me wasn’t what I thought it was? The fear of it being a dream—the same kind of fear I had when I first woke up in the hospital—had crept back into my mind. But I shoved it away. I had to. Because if I didn’t, I’d lose everything.

We moved into a bigger house when Lily got old enough. I remember the day we signed the papers. It was a new chapter for our family. The new house was nice, with a big backyard, space for a garden, and a small office for me. I was making more money at work, so it made sense. Everything felt like it was falling into place. But every time we moved furniture into the new house, A persistent sense washed over me, like I had already walked this path. I couldn’t explain it. It was like I had walked through this exact hallway, sat at that same kitchen table in some other life. The feeling was fleeting, so I pushed it aside. But it was always there.

The anniversary of the accident came around again. Sarah asked if I wanted to talk about it, and I told her I was fine, that I’d put it behind me. But that wasn’t entirely true. I hadn’t forgotten, but I had buried it deep enough that it didn’t come up in conversation. It didn’t need to. I was a new man, right? The man I had become. The man I was proud of.

But that night, I sat alone in the dark, staring out the window, thinking about how far I had come since the accident. I still couldn’t remember all the details, but I knew I had changed. I knew the life I had now wasn’t the life I had before, and in a strange way, I had come to accept that. But the doubts didn’t stop. They kept crawling back, whispering that maybe this wasn’t my life, that I was still stuck in that hospital room, still asleep, still dreaming.

That night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling again, trying to push those thoughts away. I turned to Sarah, her face soft in the moonlight, and I felt the warmth of the life we had built together. This is real, I told myself. This is my life. But just as I was drifting off to sleep, I could’ve sworn I heard something—an odd noise, like the distant beep of machinery, where it shouldn’t have been.""

I froze, straining my ears, but nothing else came. My heart was pounding, and I realized I was wide awake, fully alert, my body stiff with tension. But the sound was gone. Had I imagined it? Had I fallen asleep and was hearing things from a dream?

I tried to shake it off, but I couldn’t. My body felt too heavy, too sluggish, like I was trapped in a memory that wouldn’t let me go. I had built a life, a real life, but there was still a nagging voice in the back of my mind, reminding me that something wasn’t right. That none of this could be real.

Everything is fine. This is real. I had built this life—my life. Sarah. Lily. My job. The house. We were happy. I kept saying that this was it. This was real. No more confusion, no more doubts. I had moved past the accident, moved past the hospital. I had left all that behind, hadn't I? I need to move on already.

It was a lamp, that finally broke me.

I was sitting in the living room one evening, Lily playing in the corner, Sarah making dinner in the kitchen. It was just another normal night. The kind of night you don’t think twice about. But then my gaze fell on the lamp in the corner of the room. It wasn’t anything special, just a simple table lamp, a soft yellow light spilling out from underneath its shade.

But something about it... shifted.

It was subtle—just a flicker. But then, it happened again. The light didn’t just flicker, it distorted. The shadow cast across the room twisted, bent in a way that didn’t make sense. The lamp itself looked wrong, like it was melting into the table, as if reality itself was bending around it. I blinked, trying to clear my vision, but the distortion remained. The entire room seemed to warp around the lamp, like the walls were breathing in sync with the flickering light.

I didn’t understand it. The world around me felt too real—too solid—to change like this. I began to panic. Something wasn’t right. Something was terribly wrong.

I stood up, my legs shaking. I reached out toward the lamp as if that would fix it, but my hand fell just short of it. The flickering light started to pulse, and the room felt like it was collapsing in on me. This wasn’t real, I thought. This can’t be real.

I turned around to call Sarah’s name, but when I looked at her, her face was also melting. She didn’t look like Sarah. Not the way she should have. Her eyes were distant, her smile falling off of her, like she was part of something I couldn’t understand. The world was warping faster around me, everything becoming out of focus.

The panic flooded my chest. I stumbled back, gasping, my mind screaming that this wasn’t happening, that I was imagining it. My legs gave out, and I fell to the ground, clutching my head as the room spun around me.

And then, in an instant, everything stopped.

The world didn’t just fade—it snapped. The air felt cold. The warmth I’d felt in the house was gone. My body was stiff with shock, and I could feel every inch of the bed beneath me. I wasn’t in the living room anymore. I wasn’t in the house with Sarah and Lily.

I was back in my bed, in my own room, in my house. But this wasn’t the life I had just been living. This wasn’t the world I had just walked through.

I shot up from the bed screaming—I didn’t even know I was screaming, but I was. I looked around, desperate for something—anything—that would make sense of where I was. The room was too quiet. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t process what was happening.

I... I had been in that life. I had been living that life. It was real. It had felt real. Every moment of it—every second of that life with Sarah, with Lily—felt like it was mine. It had been years, years, and now I was here, in this room, in this bed. Why wasn’t I still there?

I couldn’t stop crying. I couldn’t stop shaking. I held my head in my hands, trying to gather myself, trying to piece together what was happening.

I told myself it was just the shock. I told myself that this—this—was what the doctor had meant. That this was what they had warned me about. That the concussion had messed with my mind, that I had built this whole life as a coping mechanism. That everything I had lived through—the family, the job, the house—was just a dream. A dream that had felt too real.

But deep down, I knew it wasn’t just the concussion. This wasn’t just some foggy aftermath. This felt like a second chance. Like I had lived a life, and now I was awake in this one. But that didn’t make sense either, did it? Because I wasn’t just waking up from an accident anymore. I was waking up from something else. Something bigger.

The panic and pain tore me apart, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even speak. All I could do was sit there in my bed, in my room, sobbing uncontrollably.

Eventually, I forced myself to calm down. Get a grip, I told myself. It’s not real. It’s just your brain trying to piece things together.

But how could it be? How could everything I had lived for years suddenly be nothing?

I tried to bury it. I tried to bury everything about that fake life. The memories, the feelings, the confusion. I couldn’t afford to let it take over again. I had to live in the present, move forward. I had to make something out of this second chance, even if everything about it felt so unnervingly familiar.

The therapy had helped, at least for a while. After the breakdown following the end of that life, I needed someone to talk to. The therapist helped me understand my anxiety, my fears, and the shock I had gone through. He told me that it was common for people in recovery to feel like they were losing grip on reality, like their sense of time and identity was fractured. That I had to rebuild my life in small, manageable steps. He told me to stop worrying about the future, to focus on each moment.

But it was hard. I went through the motions—work, therapy, and eventually, I met Emily. She seemed like the kind of person who could help me find my footing. She had a calm, patient energy that was the complete opposite of my frantic thoughts. We went on casual dates, laughed over coffee, talked about the future, and I tried to convince myself that this was my reality. But there were moments—flashes—where it felt like I was looking at a life I hadn’t lived, like I was acting out a script.

Sometimes, I would sit in my apartment at night, staring at the walls, the ticking of the clock on the wall keeping me company. I could almost feel the life I had before—Sarah, Lily, the house, the routine—hovering just out of reach. When I was alone, it was easy to slip back into the feeling that nothing had truly changed. The sense of déjà vu was unbearable. It was like I was waiting for something—waiting for everything to collapse, for the world to bend, for the dream to shatter again.

I had stopped seeing the therapist after a while, not because I didn’t need it, but because I couldn’t bear to face the truth. I had convinced myself that if I just kept moving forward, kept working and building, everything would fall into place. I didn’t need to dig up old wounds anymore. But I could feel them under the surface, festering.

Then, the doubts came back. They were impossible to ignore. One day, I was sitting at a café, reading a book when a woman walked in. Her hair was dark, pulled back in a ponytail, and for a moment, as she passed me, I thought it was Sarah. I blinked, and the illusion vanished. It wasn’t Sarah. She wasn’t even close. She was just a woman who looked vaguely like her, but for that split second, it had felt so real. I stared at her, trying to make sense of it. But I didn’t know what to think. I couldn’t explain why it affected me so much. She had reminded me of Sarah in the smallest of ways—her smile, the way she moved, the way she held her coffee cup—but it was nothing more than a simple resemblance.

I tried to brush it aside, but it stayed with me. The thought didn’t leave me for days. And then, another woman, a different one, had a similar effect. The same smile, the same posture, the same eyes that felt like they belonged to someone I had known forever. I could feel the panic creeping up, the same anxiety I had felt after I woke up from that nightmare. I wasn’t just seeing Sarah in these women—I was seeing everything I had lost. I was seeing a version of a life that I had built, and then had it taken away.

I tried to tell Emily about it, about these strange moments, but the words wouldn’t come out right. She looked at me with concern, as if she could see the fear in my eyes.

“You’re just stressed,” she said one night, pulling me into her arms, trying to calm me. “You’ve been through a lot, but you’re here now. You’re safe.”

But I didn’t feel safe. Not at all. I could hear her voice, but in the back of my mind, the doubts were louder. The fear of losing another life. The fear that this, too, was just another dream. I might as well have just been in a mental asylum.

Time went on, and I kept building. I kept pushing forward. I moved into a better apartment, signed up for a few hobby classes to meet new people, tried to keep my mind from wandering back to the things I didn’t want to face. I forced myself to let go of the past, to forget the fake life and focus on the future. Emily and I traveled to the coast one weekend, stayed in a cabin near the beach. It was supposed to be the kind of weekend that erased all the doubts. But the moment I saw the ocean, I felt that familiar sense of wrongness creep back in. The waves crashed against the shore, but for a second, it felt like I had been here before. It was as if this moment, this very feeling, had been lived through once already. I couldn’t explain it, but I felt it—again.

I woke up early the next morning, walking down to the beach to clear my head. The salty air hit me with a mix of comfort and dread. As I walked along the sand, I couldn’t help but look at the waves and wonder if this was my life, or if it was just a continuation of something I was trying to outrun.

Eventually, Emily found me standing by the water, her footsteps soft on the sand behind me.

“James?” Her voice was gentle, but there was a hint of worry there, as if she could sense the turmoil beneath my calm demeanor.

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, turning to her with a forced smile. “Just thinking.”

But deep down, I knew I wasn’t fine. The pain won't go away, it's a permanent scar.

I wanted to believe that this life was mine, that I had built it from scratch. But the doubts kept growing. Every time I looked at Emily, I could see flashes of the past, echoes of a life I’d left behind. Every time I thought I had left it all behind, I found myself sinking back into the same spiral.

And the more I built this life, the more it felt like I was still trying to wake up.

It happened slowly at first. A smell here, a sound there. I thought I was imagining things, but the strange sensations persisted. I had just stepped into a small bakery one morning, the sweet smell of fresh bread in the air, when the faintest whiff of something else hit me. Sterile. Clinical. Like the smell of disinfectant. It wasn’t strong, but it was there, just beneath the warm, yeasty scent. My heart rate spiked. I paused, glancing around, expecting to see a nurse or a medical staff member, but there was nothing. Just the baker behind the counter, preparing the pastries.

I left quickly. I had to. Otherwise, I knew I would start falling apart.

But it kept happening. Over the next few days, I’d pass stores, cafés, even public bathrooms, and that same sterile, hospital-like scent would sneak up on me. Sometimes it would be mingled with other smells, like coffee or food, but it was always there, lurking beneath the surface. And then there were the machine beeps—the mechanical beep that seemed to come out of nowhere. I heard it at a café, at the grocery store, even in my own apartment, though I knew there were no machines around.

The beeping started quietly, a soft sound that seemed to come from nowhere. Then, it would stop suddenly, leaving me disoriented and unsettled. I’d glance around, looking for the source, but no one else seemed to notice. The moments were so brief, so disorienting, that I thought I was losing my mind. The next time it happened, I was driving on a quiet road with no music. It finally overwhelmed me, pushing me to my breaking point, and I started having a panic attack, ultimately losing consciousness.

The moment I fully realized what had happened came when I was sitting in a quiet room at the hospital. I had been drifting in and out of a strange, half-conscious state, but I was aware enough to see the doctor and nurse sitting across from me.

“James,” the doctor said gently, as though explaining something to a child. “You’ve been in a coma for 13 years. You were in an accident, and your body was unresponsive for a long time. It’s been a long recovery.”

All i could do was, sit in silence.

Thirteen years. Thirteen years of nothing. Of dreams. Of fake lives.

I couldn’t process it. My mouth went dry as the words sank in. How could I have been unconscious for so long? And if I had been in a coma, then what had I just experienced? The life I had built, the one with Emily, the job, the apartment—none of it had been real. It had all been another dream, just like the first. And now, I was being told it was all just a cruel continuation of my own mind’s need to cope.

The doctor continued explaining. “Your body’s been through a lot, James. The therapy will help you regain muscle strength, and you’ll need to work on speech and motor skills. You’ve lost a lot of time, but we’re here to help you get back on track. It’ll take time, but we believe you can make a full recovery.”

Full recovery? How could I make a full recovery from something that wasn’t real? My mind was reeling, but I tried to hold it together.

I was led to a therapy room later that day. The physical therapist started by gently moving my arms and legs, guiding them through basic motions as I lay there. It felt like I was in someone else’s body, unfamiliar and foreign, but the therapist was patient. She kept reassuring me that I was doing well, that my body was responding. But it didn’t feel like it. It felt like I was learning to walk again, learning to use my body again.

Next, I started speech therapy. The words came slowly, but they came. I tried to form sentences, to express myself, but it was like trying to pull words from a dark, distant place. They wouldn’t come easily. I had to focus, to remember how to speak.

It was all so overwhelming. I was told that I would need to be monitored for my mental health, that the trauma of my coma and everything I had been through could have long-lasting effects. So, they put me on suicide watch.

It was for my own safety, they said. I didn’t argue. At this point, I didn't care enough to argue. They were smart to do it, because if there had been any opportunity for me to end it all right then and there, I would have. I just wanted the confusion to stop. I wanted to know if I was still dreaming, if everything was still a lie. Was this real? Was I awake?

My parents came to visit, sitting beside my bed in that sterile, quiet room. They spoke to me like everything was fine, like the years didn’t matter, but I could see the worry in their eyes. The fear. They had lost so much time with me, too, and I could see that they were terrified of what I would be like now that I was awake. I didn’t know how to make them understand what I had been through. How could I explain that none of this felt real? That everything I had just experienced, the life I had been building—it wasn’t real?

And then came the moment when I thought I might just go insane. I was sitting in my room late one night, looking out the window at the city lights, when I heard that beeping again. It wasn’t coming from a machine nearby—it was in my mind. I could hear it as clearly as if it was right next to me.

The sound echoed through the walls, and it felt like it was coming from deep within my mind, drawing me back into that familiar, suffocating sense of confusion. The room felt too small. The lights felt too bright. I was losing grip.

The nurses and doctors came in the next morning. They told me I needed rest. They told me I needed to calm down, that it was just part of the recovery process. They gave me a small toy—a fidget spinner. Something to keep my hands busy, to focus on. It was a simple tool, something small to help manage the anxiety, the uncertainty.

I didn’t know why they thought it would help. But as I sat there, spinning the small, colorful toy in my hands, I couldn’t help but stare at it. It spun and spun, perfectly balanced. I played with it for hours, and for a moment, I could almost believe that it was the only thing keeping me anchored to reality.

I stopped it with my finger, and it immediately came to a halt, as I expected. It felt real. The stillness of it, the weight of the moment, the way it sat in my hand—it was exactly what I needed.

But then I spun it again and placed it on the table, watching how long it would spin.

The spinner continued, spinning effortlessly. At first, I was amused. It spun and spun, longer than I expected. I watched, fascinated, as it kept going—slowing, but never quite stopping. I glanced at the clock. It had been several minutes, and it was still spinning.

It shouldn’t have kept going. It didn’t make sense. I knew how long it had been spinning, this seemed oddly impossible. I waited for it to slow down completely, to come to a stop. But it didn’t. It just kept going. A faint wobble, yes, but it was still moving.

I stared at it, The more I looked at it, the more I felt that all too familiar sensation. The longer it spun, the more I questioned everything.

Was I awake? Was this real? Was I still stuck in some endless dream, just like before?

It finally slowed down, coming to a near stop—But the feeling of dread stayed with me. The room felt too quiet, too still, and yet, the spinner’s motion was all I could focus on. I stared at the ceiling for a while, drifting in and out of sleep, but I could still hear it. It was still spinning, and I couldn’t bring myself to look.

Was this my reality? Or was this just another dream?",5,1738099355.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False
1iccpq8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iccpq8,The Hardest Challenge Possible,"I recently beat a Cuphead challenge, that in my now 6 years of playing this game, can officially say in my opinion is the hardest challenge you can do that is actually possible. Forget Peashooter only, S ranking, Worst shot, all of those are extremely easy compared to this. No Shooting. The rules are simple. Don't shoot. EX's and Whetstone are all allowed, and you're going to want to upgrade your relic as soon as possible because of this. Shooting at the ground at the beginning of the fight is allowed if you want a desired EX. Doing that just removes the RNG factor and resetting a fight over and over. But if a shot lands on anyone, you have to reset. Here's my strategy I did if you want any advice.

Start a new save, and immediately do everything you can before fighting a single boss. P Rank both Forest Follies and Treetop Trouble, and access the first Mausoleum. Complete all of the King's champions, and get all secret coins that you can. By this point, you should have plenty of coins to buy the relic and Coffee. Use either Chalice or Coffee and beat the secret fight to start your relic grind, which is the real hurdle in this challenge. Here's all the bosses I did to upgrade it fully:

Root Pack
Goopy
Hilda
Cagney
Ribby and Croaks (on Simple to access Isle 2)
Baroness
Grim
Moonshine Mob (on Simple to access Esther)
Esther

After beating them you should have upgraded the relic. (And over 1,600 deaths, if you're like me) But after that, you're set. Most of the rest of the fights are much more straight forward once you upgraded. Werner, Dr. Kahl, and Carla are esspesially easy. But then we get to Phantom Express. In my opinion, the hardest boss in this challenge. You will NEED to use Djimmi's wishes for them. (If I remember, I used the other two for Glumstone and The Devil.) The Converge EX will be your best friend here. Thank me later. But once you're done with them, you're set. King Dice is very easy if you play your cards right, and the Devil isn't much harder. Isle 4's fights are much tougher though. Glumstone's phase 1 is very cumbersome, as is Mort's. Saltbaker's fight is stressful, and the Aces just takes forever. 

I only recommend playing this if you REALLY want to test yourself. This challenge shows no mercy, and took me about a full month to beat, with 1,674 deaths, most of which were just from upgrading the relic. Things get very technical too. Wasting parries just to use your axe, switching EX shots during phase transitions to get the most damage, it's not for the faint of heart, and you will rage. But stick to it, and it is very rewarding. You will feel like a god afterwards. Sorry for the ramble, take care. Bellow, I posted my time cards for anyone curious.

2. **Diary time:** Ask users to jot down their thoughts and feelings while using your product for a bit. You'll get a feel for their habits and emotions over time.
3. **Let them help design:** Invite users to join you in designing the product. They'll feel more invested, and you'll get a better idea of what they want.
4. **Job-to-be-done chats:** Focus on what your users are trying to do with your product. Talk to them about why they want to do these things and what outcomes they're after.
5. **Test on the fly:** Run quick, informal user tests in public spots like coffee shops or parks. You'll get fast feedback from all sorts of people.
6. **Prototype face-off:** Make a few different prototypes and see which one users like best. This way, you can quickly figure out what works and what doesn't.
7. **Lights, camera, action:** Get users to film themselves using your product and talking about their experience. You'll get an up-close look at their thoughts and feelings.
8. **Make research fun:** Turn user research into games or challenges. Users will have a blast and be more willing to share their thoughts.
9. **Social media stalking (kinda):** Keep an eye on social media for chats about your product or industry. You'll catch trends and pain points you might've missed otherwise.
10. **Team up with influencers:** Work with well-known folks in your industry to get feedback and reach their followers for user research. It's a win-win situation.
11. **Slack invite:** There is nothing scarier than having your customer have access to your time whenever they want. Equally, there is nothing more rewarding than having your customer have access to you whenever they want :) Embrace the scary…odds are, it’s good for you AND your company.

Is there anything you think should be added to this list? Always love to hear how other founders stay close to their customers!

1icces3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1icces3/retaliation_from_supervisor/,Retaliation From Supervisor,"Hello! Just want to preface this is a throw away account just in case anyone from my company knows how to use reddit. 

I work for a pretty popular coffee chain that has gotten much more corporate in the last few years. I have worked at this company for almost three years at the same location as a shift supervisor. About a year into my job there, my first manager left to go work in the corporate part of the company and a fellow shift supervisor was promoted to be our new manager. Its been a bumpy few years with her leadership skills and just overall competency but I would say in the last 6 months it truly all went to shit. 

Because this company loves making roles and titles for everyone, above her (her manager) is called our Area Lead. He is basically my boss's boss and is the boss to all of the other store managers in specific stores. When my manager started showing inappropriate work behavior and conduct (such as showing up anywhere from 1-2 hours late every shift, leaving said shifts 1-2 hours early, taking calls while on the floor, lying about where she was, lying about taking care of issues that were occurring, etc) I reached out to him to discuss these issues. Her behavior was having a direct impact not only on my life there but also the general wellness of the store. 

When I reached out to him via email, I specifically in the email asked him to keep it anonymous in fear of retaliation from my manager. To be honest, she is an unhinged person and I knew she would not handle hearing feedback well at ALL especially from myself. Well a few weeks ago, I found out that he did not keep my feedback anonymous at all and told her every thing I had to say about her. I found this out because she told me in a one-on-one meeting we had. My conversation with the area lead was in late November and I started noticing a complete shift in behavior from my manager around December. She was purposely icing me out of conversations, not sharing important information with me about the store but most importantly cut back my hours. I have always had an agreement with what my hours/days would look like working there, even with the previous manager. I have even had to have multiple conversations with the current manager to fix my schedule so it has the appropriate amount of hours. But ever since the feedback was shared, she refuses to extend my hours more than a set amount. She will give newer coworkers (who I have seniority over with both time and skill) longer shifts, ask people to extend their shifts, find outside coverage to pick up shifts and will just not schedule me any more than she already has. 

My question is do I have a case of retaliation? I have reached out to HR but I am honestly weary of them since I already thought I could trust my area lead and clearly that wasn't the case. They have a big culture of ""protecting their own"" in the company and once you become a certain level, there is not a lot of consequences for much. She has always been a horrible manager and I have tried to just coexist for peace and my money sake, but now that she has been messing with my hours and I have direct proof of a breach of confidentiality, this is just unacceptable.

1icceb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1icceb3/starbucks_earnings_top_estimates_but_samestore/,"Starbucks earnings top estimates, but same-store sales decline for fourth straight quarter","Starbucks on Tuesday reported that its same-store sales slid for the fourth consecutive quarter, but the company’s quarterly earnings and revenue beat Wall Street’s expectations.

The coffee giant kicked off a turnaround plan last quarter in the hopes of reviving its U.S. business, which has slumped over the last year.

“While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released on the company’s website on Tuesday afternoon.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 69 cents vs. 67 cents expected

Revenue: $9.4 billion vs. $9.31 billion expected

The company’s net sales of $9.4 billion were unchanged from a year earlier.

The company’s same-store sales fell 4%, fueled by a 6% decline in traffic to its stores. Wall Street was expecting a steeper drop of 5.5%, according to StreetAccount estimates. Both its U.S. and international locations outperformed expectations.

U.S. same-store sales slid 4% as traffic to its cafes fell 8%. Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting “back to Starbucks” and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience.

Outside of its home market, same-store sales also declined 4%.

Starbucks’ same-store sales in China, its second-largest market, fell 6%, fueled by a 4% in average ticket. The coffee giant has been leaning into discounts in China to compete with rivals that have much lower prices, like Luckin Coffee.

Title: ""Pass Peace Forward 7-Day Challenge: Spread Joy and Positivity"" Introduction:

Welcome to the ""Pass Peace Forward"" 7-Day Challenge! This challenge invites you to embrace positivity, practice acts of kindness, and spread joy in your everyday life. By participating in this challenge, you will not only bring happiness to others but also cultivate a greater sense of well-being within yourself. Are you ready to embark on this journey of spreading peace and positivity? Let's dive in!

Day 1: Start with Yourself

Today, focus on cultivating inner peace within yourself. Take a few moments for self-reflection and set positive intentions for the day. Practice self-care activities such as meditation, journaling, or engaging in a hobby that brings you joy. Remember, when you radiate peace, it becomes contagious.

Day 2: Smile at Strangers

A smile is a simple yet powerful gesture that can brighten someone's day. Make an effort to smile at strangers you encounter today. Whether it's your neighbor, a coworker, or a passerby, your genuine smile can create a ripple effect of positivity and warmth.

Day 3: Random Acts of Kindness

Perform random acts of kindness throughout your day. It could be buying a coffee for the person behind you in line, holding the door for someone, or leaving a kind note for a colleague. Small gestures can make a big difference and inspire others to do the same.

Day 4: Spread Positivity Online

Harness the power of social media to spread positivity today. Share uplifting quotes, inspirational stories, or words of encouragement with your friends and followers. Use your platform to create a positive digital space where people can find joy and motivation.

Day 5: Express Gratitude

Take a moment to express gratitude to the people in your life who bring you peace and happiness. Write a heartfelt message, send a gratitude card or simply tell them in person how much you appreciate their presence. Gratitude not only strengthens relationships but also cultivates a sense of peace within ourselves.

Day 6: Connect with Nature

Spend time immersed in nature today. Take a walk in the park, visit a botanical garden, or simply sit outside and observe the beauty around you. Connecting with nature helps to ground us and brings a sense of tranquility, which we can then share with others.

Day 7: Inspire Others to Join

On the final day of the challenge, inspire others to pass peace forward. Share your experiences and reflections with your friends, family, or online.",1,1738098440.0,u_jhbrannen1,0,1.0,False
1iccc1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BusinessFlight9687/comments/1iccc1s/houlihans_galleria_mall/,Houlihan’s Galleria Mall,"Let me start by saying how empty the mall and movie theater was and how extremely disappointing it is even for a Monday. We all know why places close early and we're going to loose our theaters too. I said it before- go inside and fill these establishments so they do not close. Make them add security again!!!!

Anyway, Houlihan's did not have a wait and I was able to be seated quickly. The staff were quick to take my order. Iahna S was my server. I ordered the prime rib eggrolls as an appetizer. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask for a takeout box for those. I was full - my fault. Next I ordered Fire at the Disco. Cute name for a drink. I normally order before I go out no matter what day of the week but no one asks me out anymore, aside from a few friends. I mean few. 

Anyway, back to my review, I had the 5 oz Atlantic Salmon with topped mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was cooked to perfection by Mathin and 4 other chefs. 5 Chefs - how can you go wrong. You can't!!! The salmon was moist , topped mashed potatoes were seasoned perfectly, and zing the asparagus superb. I topped everything with lemon. Yes, including the potatoes. Dive(n) dive in. 

Next, my final accompaniment, was the dessert. I was full at this point but I had to have a few bites. Probably why I left the egg rolls. I had salted butter cake and yes it comes with ice cream. I couldn't even finish with a coffee or latte bc I was full and hadn't finished my Fire at the Disco yet but both tasted great together - so get two if you have room. 

The final receipt with tip was above appripriate for what I received. Don't change your prices, please. 

Finally, staff was IAHNA S, Manager, Cathy, Bartender, Andrea and 1 of 5 Chefs, Mathin. 

I enjoyed myself. Thank you all.

(It’s never been great and his naps are getting wonkier by the week.) The problem is, I shower during that morning nap right now. I don’t really know how to explain it, but I have needed to shower in the morning in order to be awake the rest of the day for pretty much the last 20 years of my life. I can make it through the first couple hours on just a cup of coffee, but if I skip the shower, by noon I feel like absolute crap. 

Does anyone have ideas for ways that I can still sneak in a shower in the morning if he’s awake? Our bathroom is much too small to do something like fit a playpen in there. He’s also not great at independent play, I’ve tried to foster this and he’s getting better but he’s still basically a Velcro baby. The last couple of times I’ve tried to shower with him in any kind of container in the bathroom he’s just scream-cried the whole time.

Probably the most obvious solution would be to get up about 20 minutes before he does and sneak in a shower then. But sometimes he wakes up at 7 and other times if I didn’t wake him up, I’m pretty sure he’d sleep well past 8. So it’s a little bit hard to predict when I would need to wake up to make that work.",9,1738098369.0,SAHP,22,1.0,False

1icc6j8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1icc6j8,3-way solenoid,"Hi, fixed my coffee machine by putting new solenoid, but here's what I found all along

if water doesn't flow from your group head, while steam and pouring hot water are fine, you probably have to look into 3-way solenoid

when you press 1/2 cups - electrical current pulls the plunger inside the valve of 3-way solenoid and the water flows into the group head pouri a coffee. I suppose that's why there's an audible click when we press 1/2 cups

I might be wrong, but I suppose steam/ hot water don't need turning on solenoid, since the valve in 3-way solenoid is normally open for that flow. also when 3-way solenoid's coil is faulty or valve/ plunger are stuck due to dirt/ scale - water will flow the same way. when manifold for steam/ hot water is neutral that's 3rd position for excessive steam/water (?!) that is why when water flow is blocked from group head - it drips into bottom tray

you can try to inspect 3-way solenoid yourself and fix it. I'll leave some pics some might find useful. also keep the black o-ring, New 3-way solenoid might be sold without one

Hello. I have a profitec pro 500 with flow control. This morning it stopped working properly. I use a WEMO to turn it on from upstairs. The dial on the left which is the pressure for the steam wand didn’t move upward to the 1.0-1.2 bar. The hot water from the other side (water valve?) nothing comes out. I can feel the heat so I know the water got hot. The lever for the portafilter when I lift it hot water comes out of the group head. So just to recap my issue, no steam from the wand, no hot water from the hot water spout and no pressure. But if I grind beans and put it in the portafilter and pull the lever I get coffee with pressure. Thank you. ",2,1738097714.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

After **two months** of testing these **AirPods Pro 2**  from **Kakobuy**, I’m here to confirm: they’re a *steal*. No hype, no fluff—just facts. Let’s dive in.

https://preview.redd.it/hyn1zf4ossfe1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eac3ec2af54570892c517368080d23054127cf4

# 📦 Unboxing: “Wait, Did I Get Scammed?”

* **Packaging**: Double-boxed with **1:1 retail vibes**—plastic wrap, manuals, ear tips, cables. My friend’s genuine pair? Side-by-side, they’re twins.
* **First Impression**: Zero “replica” red flags. Even the case hinge *clicks* like the real deal.

# 🔥 Why These Are My Go-To

* **Sound Quality**: Bass punches, highs sparkle. Music feels alive, calls are clear (except the mic… more on that later).
* **Battery Life**: **10+ hours** total, 6-7 hours nonstop. Survives my workday *and* gym sessions.
* **ANC & Transparency Mode**: Silence subway chaos or hear your coffee order get butchered. *Chef’s kiss*.
* **iOS 16 Magic**: Switches between iPhone 13 and MacBook like they’re telepathic.
* **MagSafe & Find My**: Charges wirelessly, pops up in Find My (but the case won’t beep—meh).
* **Spatial Audio**: Head-tracking so smooth, I forgot I wasn’t in a movie theater.

**Bonus Flex**: Case button feels premium, and the LED light diffusion? *Spot-on*.

# 🙃 The “Okay, Let’s Be Real” Cons

* **Mic Quality**: Still sounds like you’re in a fishbowl. Classic AirPods move.
* **Wind + ANC = 🌀**: Gusty days = microphone tornado. Invest in a scarf.
* **Low Battery Blues**: Sometimes takes 10 seconds to connect. *Cue impatient toe-tapping*.
* **Case Scratches**: Minor scuffs after two months.

# 💸 Final Verdict: Kakobuy Wins

For **under $60**, these are a **glitch in Apple’s pricing matrix**. The pros *crush* the cons unless you’re hunting for flaws. Kakobuy delivered fast (2 weeks to Canada pre-holidays), and their service was seamless.

it was like 7:30-8:00, and it was really windy out. we were talking to each other at the register, because there was no one in the store. all of a sudden, the office door slams shut. not a breeze in the store, no one in sight. just us. you have to physically shut the door for it to close. and it slammed. 

she has left for the night at 9:00, and i was alone for about an hour, so i started doing my coffees which involves me going to the kitchen to dump them in the sink. anyways, i’m dumping coffees, when i hear a loud crash out in the store, so i ran out to find nothing. so i went to go back into the kitchen, and the sink was running. which i didn’t turn on in the first place. at this point, i started to get angry. i yelled out “whoever or whatever is messing with me stop it’s not funny” and the store went dead silent. you could hear a pin drop. so i put on some music to ease the quiet. 

9:55 rolled around and i started to close down, i was counting down my drawer when i heard a crash come from the kitchen. i was the only one here. i had locked the door already, and checked the back door. locked. i finished my count, walked to clock out. and as i unlocked the door and put in the code to leave, i yelled out “leave me alone and stop “f*cking with me!!” i walked out, shut the store down and left.

I'm super focused during my visits, I do my workout, I don't go out of my way to socialise. I'm only chatting as far as helping someone out if they need a hand, and being friendly with the staff, but not much more.

There's this man that is fairly attractive who has been around for a while as well. He's also not chatting around much. Over the past few months, we've caught each other's eyes a few times and smiled at each other. Eventually I thought, what the hell, I have to make a move. It took me a few weeks to build up the courage, but I finally walked up to him last week and introduced myself. He looked fairly happy and we had a short chat, making small talk. It was obvious we were both nervous. 

Since then, we crossed path only once, yesterday, and said hi but didn't have a chat. 

Our workout times don't overlap super often, once a week if I'm lucky. So even if I manage to push myself out of my routine and chat with him at the gym, it'll take FOREVER to get to know him. 

I've been thinking that it might be smarter to take it out of the gym and ask if he'd like to go out for coffee. But is it appropriate to ask that to someone you barely know in that environment? I'm imagining the other way around, being a woman who comes to the gym to work out and doesn't need guys to walk up and ask her out. Or am I overthinking this?

With no particular reason, and it's not a bad mood, i just feel the anxiety, I'm not anxious during the rest of the day i'm just tired(i've been having a fatigue issue, but i don't think it's super related), as soon as i come home i'm super energized and anxious it's weird asf, same thing used to happen at uni(i didn't have a fatigue problem then btw)

I'm thinking maybe i'm not giving myself enough time to decompress, maybe loneliness, maybe what i do when coming home is too stimulating(family, gaming/internet) but i even feel anxious before going on my computer(which is sometimes the thing that triggers anxiety), maybe it's the switch from work to home that's too abrupt, maybe i am stressed at work but it just makes me sleepy to be in that environment?

Idk.., anyways i'm putting that here to rant/think it through and incase some of you experience something similar and has some input or advice, ik it's very subjective, i'll try to find things that work for me, also paradoxally i do think i am tired when coming home because i just want to go on my computer do smth effortless (youtube/twitch, league of legends, discord) but this seems to make things work.

(Important to note that i'm also trying to use nootropics to combat the fatigue and anxiety, trying out bromantane currently, today it didn't do a lot, felt groggy/sleepy most of the day so i took coffee at noon but i'm trying to stop coffee because it has crashes and induces anxiety, i'll be trying out aniracetam soon hopefully it'll help, bcs i've also been having some brainfog/difficulty finding words or just having something to say in social settings *blank*🧠😶‍🌫️)",1,1738097538.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace Distillery  
**ABV:** 63.8% (127.6 proof)  
**Age:** NAS (No Age Statement)  
**Tasting Method:** Neat in a Glencairn glass, rested for 10 minutes  
**Reviewed by:** Patrick Walsh, with The Jasmine Bar  
**Date of Review:** January 28, 2025

# Sensory Evaluation

**Appearance:**  
Deep chestnut brown with glints of ruby when held to the light. The liquid forms thick, oily legs that move sluggishly down the glass, indicative of its high proof and rich body.

**Nose:**  
An intense and complex bouquet opens with bold aromas of dark caramel, molasses, and burnt sugar. Layers of toasted oak and campfire smoke emerge, balanced by red berries and dried cherry. A distinct spicy undertone of cinnamon and clove is complemented by hints of leather and a faint touch of roasted coffee bean.

**Palate:**  
Stagg 24A explodes on the palate with waves of bold flavors. The initial sip reveals burnt brown sugar, dark chocolate, and ripe black cherries. The mid-palate evolves into spicy notes of cinnamon, black pepper, and nutmeg, balanced by a backbone of oak tannins and tobacco. A touch of candied orange peel and toffee adds sweetness to the depth.

**Finish:**  
A long, powerful finish that lingers with warmth and intensity. Notes of charred oak, dark chocolate, and a hint of espresso are accompanied by a peppery spice that tingles the tongue. The warmth of the high proof lingers but is never overwhelming, leaving behind an earthy, leathery aftertaste.

**Body:**  
Full-bodied with a viscous, almost syrupy texture that coats the palate luxuriously.

**Bite:**  
Assertive but not harsh, the alcohol heat is prominent but well-integrated, enhancing the intensity and complexity of the flavors.

# Impressions

**Overall Impression:**  
Stagg 24A is a robust, unapologetically bold bourbon that showcases the best of Buffalo Trace's high-proof releases. With its layers of rich sweetness, complex spice, and a finish that seems to go on forever, it demands your attention and rewards patient exploration. Perfect for seasoned bourbon lovers who appreciate intensity and depth.

**Notable Features:**

* Signature uncut and unfiltered Stagg release, offering raw barrel strength.
* Intense depth of flavor thanks to its high proof and meticulous blending.

**Occasion Pairing:**  
Ideal for sipping on a cold evening or sharing with fellow bourbon aficionados. This is a whiskey for moments of celebration or deep reflection.

# Value Assessment

**Price:**

* **MSRP:** $59.99
* **Secondary-Market Price:** $175–$300

**Worth the Price:**  
At MSRP, this bottle is an absolute steal and a must-have for bourbon enthusiasts. On the secondary market, while the price is steep, the quality, rarity, and sensory experience justify the splurge for collectors or those seeking a standout pour.

# Rating System

* **Nose:** 8.9/10
* **Palate:** 9.5/10
* **Finish:** 9/10
* **Body:** 9.5/10
* **Overall Experience:** 9/10

**Total Score:** 45.9/50

Formerly known as ""Stagg Jr."" the rebranding and emphasis on innovation have allowed the distillery to focus on crafting high-proof masterpieces.

Taylor, but the uncut, unfiltered nature of Stagg sets it apart, offering bourbon lovers an unadulterated taste of whiskey straight from the barrel.

This particular batch continues the legacy with a flavor profile that reflects the intense aging conditions of Buffalo Trace’s warehouses. The story of Stagg is one of boldness and tradition, resonating deeply with The Jasmine Bar's ethos of celebrating exceptional craftsmanship.

# Conclusion

""Stagg 24A is a bourbon that unapologetically commands your attention. Bold, complex, and unforgettable, it is not merely a drink but a celebration of craftsmanship and time. At The Jasmine Bar, it holds a proud place as a hallmark of our collection, reminding us why bourbon continues to captivate the hearts of enthusiasts worldwide.""",1,1738097014.0,RareWhiskey,0,1.0,False

I place the order, looking for the option to redeem, which is not to be found anywhere, so I assume I will either prompt me to redeem at the end of the ordering or will deduct automatically the price of my drink, but no. It charged me full price for everything, and if I open the app again keeps prompting me to ""redeem my birthday threat"". When I click on ""redeem"" it just takes me to ordering again (sorry, I won't fall for that twice!)

There's no way to contact Starbucks as all the ""contact"" in their website is these automated FAQs that don't resolve anything.

So, hey thank you Starbucks, for pissing me off today on my birthday! I'll be sure to get my coffee somewhere else in the future! :)

As someone who relies on a solid cup (or three) of coffee to kick-start the day, this machine has a lot going for it. That said, it isn’t without its quirks. Here’s my honest take on using it daily.

The design is sleek and modern, with a stainless steel finish that looks great on the countertop. It’s a bit on the taller side, so if you have low-hanging cabinets, you might need to move it around to fill the water reservoir. The 14-cup glass carafe is surprisingly lightweight despite its size, and the ergonomic handle makes pouring easy. However, the plastic lid on the carafe feels a little flimsy and occasionally needs an extra push to snap on securely. This minor annoyance is something to keep in mind.

Brewing performance is where this machine shines. It’s fast, consistent, and offers customizable options that cater to different coffee preferences. The Brew Strength Control lets you choose between regular and bold flavors, which is fantastic if you like experimenting with different coffee beans or roasts. I’ve tried both settings, and the bold option really does bring out a richer, more robust taste. The 1-4 cup setting is also a welcome feature for days when I’m only brewing for myself and don’t want to waste coffee. Plus, the 24-hour programmability is a lifesaver for those mornings when I’m running late—nothing beats waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

Speaking of coffee flavor, the taste is exceptional. The Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 uses a gold-tone coffee filter and a charcoal water filter, which ensures every cup is smooth and free of impurities. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the clarity of the coffee compared to my previous machine. The temperature settings are another highlight; you can choose between low, medium, and high to keep your coffee warm without burning it. I’ve kept mine on medium, and it stays at the perfect sipping temperature for hours.

Cleaning and maintenance are relatively straightforward but not entirely hassle-free. The carafe and filter basket are easy to rinse out, but the machine’s water reservoir can be a bit tricky to access for thorough cleaning. The self-cleaning function is helpful, though, and the machine even includes an indicator light to let you know when it’s time to descale. I recommend using filtered water to reduce mineral buildup and extend the machine’s lifespan.

**Pros**

* Customizable brewing options (regular/bold strength, 1-4 cup setting)
* Consistently great-tasting coffee with smooth flavor
* Sleek stainless steel design that complements most kitchens
* 24-hour programmability for added convenience
* Adjustable temperature settings for the warming plate

**Cons**

* Carafe lid feels a bit cheap and doesn’t always snap on smoothly
* Water reservoir can be challenging to clean
* Slightly tall design may not fit well under low cabinets
* The machine has a mostly plastic construction, which might not feel premium to some users

**Comparison to Competitors**

When comparing the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 to other coffee makers in a similar price range, it holds its ground pretty well. For instance, the Ninja CE251 offers similar programmability but lacks the Brew Pause feature that lets you sneak a cup mid-brew. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew provides a dual brewing option for single-serve pods and ground coffee, but the overall coffee quality doesn’t match the Cuisinart’s smoothness and flavor depth. If you’re looking for versatility, the Hamilton Beach might appeal to you, but for pure coffee quality, the DCC-3200P1 is the winner. That said, if you’re after a more premium feel, the Breville Precision Brewer might be worth considering, although it comes at a significantly higher price point.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 offers excellent value for its features. It’s not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, but the combination of customizable brewing options, quality construction, and great-tasting coffee makes it a worthwhile investment. While some parts of the machine are plastic, the overall durability seems solid, and the three-year limited warranty provides added peace of mind. Compared to pricier models with similar features, this coffee maker delivers a lot of bang for your buck.

The machine also includes practical features like the Brew Pause function, which allows you to pour a cup before the brewing cycle is complete, and the 60-second reset, which remembers your settings in case of a power outage. These small but thoughtful touches enhance the overall user experience and make the DCC-3200P1 a standout choice in its category.

# Procedure

Daily iqoro training

Physical rehab as usual 3x a week for shoulder issues

99+ minutes of walking daily

Tongue retainer at night

Bed at an incline sideways

The only food stocked at home will be the refeed diet of grass fed beef and tallow

Daily coffee and snus (which I admittedly should stop doing due to the apnea)

# What I feel are expected results

During the first 30 days at least 1 night of 0 AHI seems reasonable

Snoring should end up under 1 hour per night on average throughout the month

At least once per week I will have headaches, feel tired, or otherwise off. This is not a big deviation from the norm even when eating.

Expected time to reach 10% bodyfat is around 55-110 days given 0.55kg loss and between 0.55-0.275kg bodyfat lost per day.

End weight would then be between 76kg (on the low end) - 61kg (unlikely)

When refeeding I expect to gain about 4kg during the first week of refeeding. I'll probably land on 75-80kg after refeed.",1,1738095992.0,u_wang-bang,0,1.0,False

What really started to move the needle for your shop?,"My shop has been open for several years. We do the Aussie style, specialty style cafe. Fresh baked pastries and lunch/brunch round things out.

The one area we’ve always struggled with is consistent, predictable revenue. 

It’s almost impossible to do cash flow projections based on big, seasonal swings. For example today we are down over 30% over same day last week. I feel like 5-10% swings are normal. 30% is hard to understand. 

Things we’re talking about is ticketed events. Not necessarily music but intimate fireside chats, Ted talk style talks, possibly even the morning “coffee rave” or listening parties. 

Just curious what other owners have done to A) have predictable cash flow. B) products or services that moved the needle in a significant way - the kind of thing you maybe feel dumb for not doing sooner.

Curious to read your thoughts.

PS. We have great reviews and a strong regular base. Just feels like we’re leaving something on the table.

1icb6ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1icb6ry/should_i_quit/,Should I quit?,"TL;DR - serious stress at work, tough situation at home, trying to figure out what to do.

Hi all, been lurking on this forum for awhile and finally hit a point where I think I need to at least vent, at most make a tough decision.

I've been reaching a point of total stress at my job; its been a long running project that I don't think many people could do -- building a new data system with many different components at a top 5 company in my industry. I am not ""classically trained"" in this industry and I don't have a technical background, but yet...

I'm burned out, my team is burned out. I feel like getting them to do anything is like pulling teeth; these are super smart people who inch something forward instead of putting forth the effort to be comprehensive. I'm playing multiple roles including things I'm not qualified for, like trying to think through solutions/architecture, etc. Every once in awhile, it's OK. But I feel like I'm doing it all, all the time, despite having defined roles.

My boss is super supportive; the role pays so very well, but nothing will happen until we A) Deliver something acceptable or B) Crash and burn. Leadership is fine letting this nonsense continue.

I would jump ship almost to anything, including a pay cut. I have irons in the fire, but nothing concrete or on the precipice of completion.

I talk to lots of people and they say to ""let it go"" and I try to, but 80% of the time I get right back into the stress. I've lost a lot of interest

Compounding this -- my wife is incredibly ill (still works) and I want to be able to provide for her - I worry about losing my health insurance, mainly. I feel like I could make money by doing anything and I have some investments which could cover and I'd be happy to work a job or series of jobs until something concrete comes along (thinking DoorDash, work at a coffee shop or event center, freelance, etc.,)

Its hard to share my frustrations, anxiety, and stress levels with my wife; she has it way worse. She works a high-pressure job and frankly should have stopped working a long time ago -- she's an absolute machine but I think she finds pleasure in the job and its struggles, and it keeps her mind off of how sick she really is and how dimished her health has gotten. So...for me to complain when I'm perfectly healthy and primary breadwinner, to me is almost a non-starter.

It just feels like a circular hole I can't climb out of. The project isn't going anywhere (have at least 6 months to go and plenty more pain to feel along the way), I worry about quitting/not providing, but my stress level, while occasionally going down, just gets amped up right to a horrible point.

If you've made it this far, thanks. I wish I could say it felt good to empty this onto paper but it honestly is just a reminder of the stress from all areas.",2,1738095541.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

1icb4fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/krakow/comments/1icb4fr/anybody_else_feeling_sleepy_today/,Anybody else feeling sleepy today?,"I started my shift in the morning (I drive around Krakow) during daytime. Had my breakfast, had my coffee, everything was as usual, except that I started falling asleep around 4-5pm. My girlfriend who was with me felt the same way so we decided to wrap it up and head home.

Upon arrival I checked our air quality monitor and noticed a highly unusual level of CO2 — 398 ppm. For reference, the average planetary lever is around 423, so 398 is extremely low. Honestly, I’ve never even witnessed such a low level within city boundaries, and I’ve been using this monitor it for 5 years now.

Conclusion: unusually high temperatures and sunny weather resulted in photosynthesis in whatever plants there are around here and led to oxygen “poisoning”.  

Am I wrong? Please, share your thoughts.",5,1738095382.0,krakow,11,0.67,False

I want to know what I can do to help?,"My girlfriend I’ve been going out with for several months is very smart, mature and the way she talks she is very understanding. However she will act like a child at times, having a pouty mood and speaking like a babyish voice “you didn’t ask if I wanted coffee this morning, say” which I get it’s cute but stressful. I can tell when something is off and it just makes me think, “ok what did I do wrong” and then I have to pry an answer out of her. I totally understand if I wasn’t being mindful and considerate like for instance I was messy at her house leaving my stuff around or didn’t do something for her. Then we make up and get all lovey dovey. But it’s really starting to stress me out because it feels like an act, isn’t always predictable and I feel like I’ve made a serious effort to listen to her how she feels and be a good boyfriend. Last night was like a borderline tantrum, crying and hitting the bed saying I didn’t pay attention to her and on my phone. Which I can understand but it was very emotional baby talk.

Small venting needed.. hope everyone reading has been as PF as possible. Thank y’all for listening ✨ 

Just started a cycle last week (usually 2 months every 2 years, but got a small one this past May +\- 1 week). Attacks have been early morn, afternoon and lots of shadows. Only abortive is O2 for me. Off sumatriptan (was on IM and IN versions for years), uninsured & unemployed, I have medical aid through HAAM (health alliance for austin musicians) (life savers they are). 

So, got my 02 tank but the person forgot to add the key wrench, so was enduring the beast whilst watching the relief just sit in front of me all weekend. Fun. Youtubed + tried to open it with any other object I had to no avail. Sunday evening my overnight purchase arrives and finally can use my medicine! Big win for this household! Very very grateful for O2, hot showers & weed (for after). Yesterday, had an hour long attack KIP 8-9 (plus two thirty min ones KIP 10) which left my brain so fried I could only sit and stare the rest of the day. Today I wake up to the beast, have a 30 min attack, pass out, wake up again to another attack and once calm, showered, high and collected.. I look at my front door and see I had just been served. Being sued by a credit card debt while being unemployed & disabled hits differnet. 

What’s getting me though today? Animal crossing, this delicious iced coffee I just made, putting together a mix for an upcoming dj set and my partner ✨ very grateful for this space and all the PF moments 💜",2,1738095345.0,clusterheads,2,1.0,False

1icb30d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1icb30d,Prepping to make a great hobby/reading/cozy space!,"I'm about to move into a house rental and I'm so excited about having an extra room for a hobby/cozy/reading space! I wanted to post this to see if anyone has different suggestions. I'm hoping to be able to be comfy in this space and be able to relax and enjoy my special interests.

So far I am thinking:

Thick floor cushions to make a floor couch (my preference has always been to read on the floor)

A short coffee table, square so I can have a bowl in the middle with fidget toys, bookmarks, a lighter for candles etc.

2 - 3 tall wall mounted (extra secure because cats) book shelves for my roommate's and I'm books, decorative tea pots (I'm going to use gallery putty in case my cat somehow gets up there), and any small decor items we like.

A gallery wall for the non- bookcase wall, I have a lot of artworks in the yellow-green palette

As for colors, I'm thinking maybe a dark green for the floor cushions to not show any potential stains, I have a lot of squishmallows for decor but I am thinking of buying some larger comfy throws for back support, dunno what color. The wood tones for shelves and table I'm thinking an oak tone. 

Any suggestions for color palettes, furniture, or any additions/changes would be much appreciated! In the other corner of this room I'm including a record collection, but not sure which record player I'd like to upgrade into or the stand. 

Please see pics for sketch, pic of the room, and some Pinterest pins, it will be going into an average home with a small window.",4,1738095286.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

My mother who we all suspect has schizophrenia for last 18 years (not diagnosed) is showing signs that she is entering the final stages of her life. Me (her only child) and dad lives with her and started being a caretakers in this moments.  
  
Lately she stopped eating food and right now only drink couple of milk coffee’s a day or slice of apple. Her body is so weak and we are noticing Kyphosis as well, but still insists of making her coffee and doing some dish washing stuffs (Probably paranoid), even though we are constantly offering her help. And main the problem here is, she never wanna meet doctor (either at hospital or home).  I’m not sure whether she is realising things are changing in her body and life and it's making our life lil difficult.   
  
Has anybody gone through last stages of their loves one who has mental illness? How did it go? Any tips or helpful suggestions are welcome.

1icazuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1icazuv/first_time_alaska_lounge/,First Time Alaska Lounge," Today I was flying out of PDX and got to the airport around 9 for a 12:30ish departure. I planned on working for a few hours, grab an early lunch, and just have a slow morning before going back to work tomorrow. On a whim, as I passed the Alaska Lounge I went in and asked if they could accommodate a day pass since I had a few hours to burn. I was prepared to pay the 60 bucks just to try it and have a quiet place to work and relax, but flying first class it was only 30. 

Nothing special about the food, but it was decent and nice to grab an early light lunch and more than a few cups of coffee. When I was a kid, my grandmother and I would park on Marine Drive and watch the planes take off, so sitting at the bar top looking over the airfield was a nice surprise. Honestly, lunch and a couple of coffees outside the lounge probably would have been at least 30 dollars, so I was more than happy with it. Plus, it was calm and comfortable and got some work done. Probably will hit it the next time I fly through PDX with more than an hour and a half to burn. 

I fly through SEA sometimes, what’s the lounge like there? ",13,1738095065.0,AlaskaAirlines,1,1.0,False

1icazn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/1icazn7/sian_and_junseo/,Sian and Junseo,"I’m honestly shocked at the level of hate Sian and Junseo are getting right now. Yes it has been frustrating the majority of screen time being given to them, but take this out on the PDs not them. 
Yes Sian’s indecisiveness is getting dragged out as there’s 4 more episodes to go so the PDs are going to milk it. 

I’ll break down how I’ve interpreted her actions so far. Going back to last week’s episode. I think she loves the attention she’s getting from the boys, but let’s not act like that makes her the devil. People are not black and white, you’re allowed to have the good parts and less desirable qualities about yourself. 

I genuinely think Theo has been her number 1 up until her paradise date with Junseo. He’s been the guy that has persistently pursued her and she likes how sure of her he is. But she’s just not feeling the butterflies. She said in her intro she wants whirlwind, so to her Theo’s steadfastness isn’t that exciting. So even though she’s chasing the butterflies, he’s been so earnest with her and that puts him at #1 logically in her head . 

Going into Jung-su. He fits more of that butterflies romance she’s looking for hence why she was so hung up on the hand thing from the helicopter. But after the bonfire where he was so elusive with his answers she took a step back. This further reinforced to her why Theo is her number 1 given how sure he is. But going back to her liking attention, she shifted back to Jung-su in last weeks episodes purely out of jealousy seeing his attention elsewhere with the new girl. Especially after everyone in inferno told her they talked for long. Hence why we see her act out the next day with the tired and sleepy comments when it came to Jung-su. The conversation they after the acting out, it seemed to me that she just wanted to confirm his attention is still on her, that’s why she kept pushing to hear who his top choice is. She wanted assurance that attention was still on her even though everyone else thought he was into the new girl. Again  I’m not excusing her behavior just making an observation 

Now finally Junseo. She likes attention hence why she chose him for the coffee date. Up until that point he was the only guy in inferno who hadn’t made an effort to even speak to her. That’s why in that date she kept asking him what his first impressions of her were. I think the fact he didn’t pick her on day 1 must have stung her ego a little. I think after the coffee date she didn’t think he liked her that much. And as we know she loves attention that’s why she love again doubled down on Theo being #1. But with Junseo I think why things turned out different is they actually became friends, you can see it in the pool scene or when eating in inferno they just have natural banter. That’s why when he drunkenly confessed she was surprised because she had thought he wasn’t that into her after the coffee date but they were friendly. So her picking him for paradise made sense because she then wouldn’t have to make a direct choice between Theo and Jung-su whose attention she still wants to keep. I think what she didn’t account for is her actually liking him as much as she ended up doing. Everyone is so surprised at her feeling changing quickly after saying Theo was her top choice, I think the shift happen when she went to cry off camera and he followed her. I think she saw the ‘manly’ side she’d been wanting that her other two options hadn’t shown. Plus their conversation about her feelings went much deeper, she basically opened up to him about her liking 3 people and encouraged her to do what she wants instead of trying to consider everyone’s feelings. I think she needed to hear that

. The bed scene was also not that deep. She offered Jung su the same on night one. We’ve seen contestants share a bed before in other seasons. Just last season Hyseon told Gwanhee she wouldn’t mind sharing a bed with him on their first paradise night . The only difference is Junseo actually accepted her offer. There was clear sexual chemistry and you can see in the morning when she woke up she still allowed him to touch her so the ‘drunk predator’ narrative needs to stop. It’s very clear that paradise date shifted everything for her. Her straightening his hair reminded me of Seulki and Dex. Even when they went back to inferno at the table they just kept looking at each other . That paradise date had a big impact on both of them. 

It’s clear a lot more scenes have been cut out from the date hence why the sudden change seems so jarring to most viewers. Theo noticed her awkwardness around him in their conversation . I think he could sense that things had changed. That whole conversation was him telling her it’s ok if you don’t choose me. It’s a shame Junseo interrupted their conversation, I was hoping she’d be more open about her feelings shifting to Junseo. 

It’s obvious they are now each others top choice. Junseo literally had a man to man conversation with Theo about her. She was rooting for him in the fight over Jung-su. 

I will say the conversation Junseo had with Minseol was very vague and confusing. It’s clear he was trying to let her down easy by asking who else she’s interested in etc but he just didn’t have the guts to fully shut down things with her and that was wrong and misleading. 

So please let’s stop the hate and sl*t shaming. It’s incredibly unnecessary. Ok rant over, hope this made sense .",7,1738095051.0,Singlesinferno2,7,0.61,False
