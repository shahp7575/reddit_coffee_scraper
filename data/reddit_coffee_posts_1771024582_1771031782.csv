Im a substitute teacher and job coach full time. The girl I work with is a contractor and comes in for therapy services with one of the students. She complimented me a few times saying how cute I was and I made a lot of small talk to make her laugh. Shes basically the same age group as me. I asked her one time in the cafeteria if she wanted to have coffee and she said yes. I got tired of postponing it and the nerves. She gave her full name and contact info. She asked about Saturday last weekend and I said I was busy and then she said she was busy lets try next week. She was really calm and happy about it.

She did recieve my text that night and responded but it was about our day. Later she didnt respond. This week I texted her about an actors death and we talked about it. She later responded about not being able to make it for coffee this weekend becuase she spending it with her bf and then said this ""maybe we can meet up another time"". 

I asked a friend whose a girl and she says why did she agree to meeting up and still communicating with you and not blocked.

Im looking for advice because I responded to her saying thats nice off you but Im busying staying active that weekend and I have a date. I have a deep crush on her but I need to see other people. I just play it cool with her and Im fine with it.",1,1771031658.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False
1r470tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/horseracing/comments/1r470tm/weekend_races_from_across_the_country_for_feb_14/,Weekend Races from Across the Country for Feb 14 & 15,"The sport of Horse Racing sustained some heavy losses this week as trainers **King Leatherbury**, **John Shirreffs** and 2005 Champion Three Year Old Colt **Afleet Alex** all passed on.



Legendary Hall of Fame trainer **King Leatherbury** died at his home Tuesday morning. He was 92.



Leatherbury acquired his trainer's license in 1958 and won his first race the following year with a horse named Mister L at Florida's Sunshine Park (now known as Tampa Bay Downs), launching a career spanning more than a staggering six decades. 

Leatherbury's horses won 6,508 races, earning $64,693,537. He captured a mind boggling 52 training titles in Maryland, 26 each at Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park, and four meet championships at Delaware Park.

""Nobody in the history of racing … has done what he's done the last 25 years: that being training the horses from speed figures, the Racing Form, using top assistants and veterinarians,"" trainer Buddy Delp of Spectacular Bid fame once said “Believe me, King Leatherbury can train any racehorse that ever lived, and train him to perfection.""

**John Shirreffs**, who trained the great Zenyatta to a Hall of Fame career and won the 2005 Kentucky Derby with Giacomo, died unexpectedly in his sleep Feb. 12 at his home in Arcadia, Calif. He was 80.

""The industry lost a great man today,"" said jockey Mike Smith, who rode those horses to their most memorable victories, ""and I lost a good friend.""

Known for his patience, Shirreffs horses won 596 races and more than $58 million in purses. 

Other top-level trainees include Life Is Sweet, Baeza, Tiago, After Market , Harmonious, Express Train, Beyond Brilliant, Gormley, and several others

His last graded stakes victory came Jan. 31 when he won the San Pasqual Stakes with Westwood.

**Afleet Alex**, winner of both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, was euthanized Feb. 6 due to the infirmities of old age. He was 24 and will be buried at Gainesway.

The son of Northern Afleet resided at Gainesway since retiring to stud in 2006. He had lived in the stud barn as a pensioner since 2022, greeting visitors (including yours truly roughly 13 times during those years) from the same stall and paddock he occupied during his active career. 

Speaking from experience, “Double A” was gentle as a lamb as all the time I spent with him, he never once threatened me. I still have a lock of his mane in my spare bedroom.

""Afleet Alex's Preakness Stakes remains one of the most incredible displays of athleticism and heart I have ever seen. He passed that same determination and talent down to his offspring,"" said Gainesway owner Antony Beck. ""A true champion in every sense and his presence at the farm will be deeply missed.""-- agreed Mr. Beck, on everything you say here.

**Laurel Park**

**Race: 8 (3:22PM EST)**

**Barbara Fritchie Stakes**

**1)** If you draw a line through **Dry Powder**’s flop in the BC Distaff, you’ll see a $525,000 daughter of Gun Runner who has hit the board in all six career starts, including just missing in a Grade: 1 two starts back

**2) Takethemoneyhoney** is about two feet short of being unbeaten in eight career starts. This race is her toughest assignment yet, so let's see how well she handles the step up in class.

**3) Passage East** sports  13-7-5-1 career mark and has never been worse than second on this oval in five tries.

Also consider: Probable longshot **Backstretch Rose**, who possesses a decent late run









**Race: 9 (3:51PM EST)**

**General George Stakes**

**1)** You get the third start off the layoff for **Quint’s Brew**, who sports an impressive 9-5-4-0 record.

**2)** You also get the third start off the layoff angle for **Point Dume**, a $450,000 gelding by Into Mischief who has run “trips” Brisnet Figures in his last two races.

**3) Slam Notion** has won four of his last five, is five for eight on this oval and his Brisnets have been climbing steadily through his last four races (77, 92, 95 and 100).









**Fair Grounds**

**Race 9 (5PM EST)**

**Mineshaft Stakes**

**1)** I tried to beat **Hit Show** here, but I simply couldn't based on the fact he just missed vs. better (Grade: 2 Clark Handicap behind Magnitude). If Magnitude was in this race, he’d be an overwhelming favorite.

**2) Accelerize** is a $400,000 son of Omaha Beach, who has won three of four career starts and showed sheer determination in winning his last. Kudos to his connections as they have brought his career along in textbook style. 

**3) Time to Win** is a $650,000 son of Not This Time that is a bit of an enigma to me. On one hand, although it took him four times to break his maiden, his career is clearly heading in the right direction. Yet at the same time, his last two races/wins are a bit odd. Note in his Dec 4 tour de force win at Aqueduct, he took over at the half (:44.4),  opened up four lengths while getting 6F in 1:09 flat, then galloping home a mile is a smoking 1:33.2. That is a tremendous race for the Aqueduct surface in December. Yet in his next start, he goes to Gulfstream Park, a vastly different (faster) surface, and runs a mile three full seconds (or roughly 15 lengths) slower at 1:36.3. How does that work? Ok, here is my theory: it appears, off such a huge effort at Aqueduct, he probably “bounced” in the Gulfstream race. If that’s true, and he can still win in a race his form “bounces” in, then we are looking at a pretty darn good racehorse. I will be watching this race closely to see what we are dealing with here.

Also consider: the seven year old, 15 time winner **Cadet Corps**, who seems to always fire his best shot.







**Race: 10 (5:30pm EST)**

**Fair Grounds Stakes**

**1) Brilliant Berti** is 7 for 13 in his career, including rallying from well back in a Grade: 1 when last seen on Oct 1.

**2) Montador** has yet to run a bad race through seven career starts.

**3) Kupuna** is in good form having won two of his last three.













**Race: 11 (6PM EST)**

**Rachel Alexandra Stakes**

**1) Bella Ballerina** was visually impressive winning her debut, then was just able to hang on and win the Grade: 2 Golden Rod at Churchill in her next and last start. I’m going to cut her some slack for that effort as it was her first start at a route distance, against Grade: 2 runners (jumping up from a maiden race) and changing surfaces and going from a straight forward surface to a quirky one, all at the same time.

**2) Just Singing** rallied from 14 lengths behind, while swinging a ridiculous eight wide on the turn, yet was only a length behind my top pick in the Golden Rod last time out. With a better trip, and I’m fairly certain she’ll get one with the rider switch (upgrade) to Johnny V, she could be a serious menace late.

3) If **Powered by Family** can get a halfway decent trip (seven wide in her debut and eight wide last time) she could be tough as well. I loved her last race as she improved leaps and bound to win easily with the stretch out in distance and the addition of Lasix. 

Also consider: Ditto **Majestical**, who also runs from well out of it early and improved big time with more ground and Lasix………..**Luv Your Neighbor** has been “right there” at the end of her last three in a row, losing heartbreakers all three time….perhaps she’s camera shy??





**Race: 12 (6:30 PM EST)**

**Risen Star Stakes**

**1)** As I mentioned last week, with the recent defection of Ted Noffey off the Kentucky Derby trail, lots of people are pointing to **Paladin**, a $1.9 million son of Gun Runner, as the Derby favorite. For me, the jury is still deliberating (as of right now, it's wide open). That said, it takes a talented animal to a) win at a mile your first time out and b) win a Grade: 2 in NY your second time out. I like his versatile running style and it certainly appears he has plenty of room for improvement. A win here and you can easily make a case for him as the Derby favorite. Lastly, please remember trainers want their runners peaking on the first Saturday in May and not on February 14.

**2)** The more I see of the well bred, stretch running **Golden Tempo**, the more I like him. I mean who doesn't like horses who lay 8, 10, 12 lengths out of it early, then bring a heroic late run down the lane? That makes for great racing and that's exactly what this colt’s game is. Horses like this are always at the mercy of the pace and he’s had decent paces to run into in his first two starts, but what happens if he gets a dawdling place in front of him which might be the case in this race? How will he respond to that? 

**3)** After chasing (second) the likes of Napoleon Solo, Icredibolt and Further Ado in his last few races, **Universe**’s last race was too bad to be true, and I expect a bounce back effort here.

Also consider: **Courting** is a vaunted, $5 million son of Curlin who has long legs and is still green, but is beginning to figure it out…………..Don’t go to sleep on **Quality Mischief**, who was still another who rallied from way back to finish just three lengths behind Golden Tempo in his last after being seven wide on the turn….longshot possibility? …..**Carson Street** has speed and led to deep stretch before being overhauled by Golden Tempo last time, outrunning his 15-1 odds in the process. 







**Gulfstream Park**

**Race: 11 (5:20PM)**

**Royal Delta Stakes**

**1) Shred the Gnar** is a $610,000 daughter of Into Mischief who has speed on top of speed. She’ll be making her first start since Nov but she should still be tough to catch in a race, on paper, looks like it's going to be a barn burner.

**2)** I like **Senza Parole** quite a bit and, after clobbering mid level optional claimers in her last, she clearly seems back to top form. 

**3)** 2025 Kentucky Oaks runner up (at 32-1) **Drexel Hill** is another who seems to have rounded back into top form.

Also consider: **Nothing Like You** who gets a trainer change and a move from Santa Anita, where she has been chasing some good fillies, to Gulfstream Park. It wouldn't be a huge surprise if she runs well here…………**Alpine** **Princess** runs best when she is on the lead. Five year old mare by Classic Empire draws the rail, so that is probably going to be the plan going in (put her on the lead).













**Sunday, February 15, 2026**

**Sunland Park**

**Race; 7 (5:15 PM EST)**

**Sunland Park Oaks**

**1) Battle of Rouge,** who is a Grade: 1 winner at Santa Anita and was only beaten by 5+ lengths in the BC Juvenile Filly race, appears to tower over this field. No need to overthink it…..she looks best?

**2) Coffee Connection** is unbeaten in two sprints, both with good/fast final times…steps up and stretches out here.

**3) Cashed** seems to have “second-itis” as she’s been second in five of seven career starts. Consistent filly has hit the board in all seven of those starts too.

Also consider: **Not a Lady** who is also laudably consistent and likes this distance, but can she handle the step up in class?........**Touch of Magic** is still a maiden but is a full sister to the talented Cornucopian and and half sister to multiple Grade: 1 winner Guarana.







**Race: 9 (6:17PM EST)**

**Sunland Park Derby**

**1) Express Kid** is an $800,000 son of Bodeexpress (who stands for $3,500) who pulled off an enormous upset when wiring the field in the Springboard Mile at Remington Park last time out, his 3rd win in 5 starts…..he won’t be almost 35-1 here that for sure.

**2) Daneyko** rallied from far back to win his Sunland Park debut/prep race for this and is a neck shy of coming into this riding a three race win streak.

**3) Bricklin** just keeps getting better as his Brisnet numbers would indicate (59, 69, 77 and 92).





**Little Bets N Pieces**

\*\*\*\* The $3 million **Brant**, winner of the Grade 1 Del Mar Futurity and third-place finisher in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile in his most recent start Oct. 31 at Del Mar, is training toward his 3-year-old debut for Bob Baffert. Where and when Brant makes that debut is uncertain.

“He’s doing really well, I was trying to get him to the Rebel, but it’s going to be tight,” Baffert said Saturday. The Grade 2 Rebel is on March 1 at Oaklawn Park. Brant posted the third workout of his comeback on Feb. 5 at Santa Anita, five furlongs in 1:01.4.

\* Baffert added that **Litmus Test**,winner of the Grade 2 Los Alamitos Futurity, is on target for the Grade 2 San Felipe Stakes on March 7 at Santa Anita.











\*\*\*\* The aptly named **Blackout Time**, who hasn't started since a runner-up finish behind eventual 2-year-old champion Ted Noffey in the Breeders' Futurity Stakes (G1) at 1 1/16 miles Oct. 4 at Keeneland, is heading towards the $1 million Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park on March 1.



At this writing, the super dark bay colt has had four published works in preparation for the Rebel.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

The worst part wasn't the rejection — it was not knowing *why*. Was I underqualified? Were my projects irrelevant? Was I even targeting the right roles?

So I built RoleMapper. You upload your resume (PDF, DOCX, or paste it), add your projects, and it gives you a full career intelligence report.

Here's what it does:

**Role Matching with Scores** — Maps your skills and projects to specific roles and tells you which ones you're qualified for right now, with a match percentage. Not keyword matching — it actually analyzes your experience against what each role requires.

**Skills Coverage** — For each role, you see ""You have 8 of 10 core skills"" with a visual breakdown of exactly what you have and what's missing.

**Resume Bullet Rewrites** — For each matched role, it takes your existing resume bullets and rewrites them with stronger action verbs, quantified impact, and ATS-friendly keywords. Shows your weak version crossed out next to the improved one.

**Interview Prep Per Gap** — For every skill gap, it generates likely interview questions you'd face and how to answer them even if you haven't fully learned that skill yet. A cheat sheet before your next interview.

**Project Blueprint** — Tells you the exact project to build next, which dataset to use (specific Kaggle links), a step-by-step architecture, tech stack, and what to highlight on your resume when it's done.

**Apply Now Links** — Each role has direct links to LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, and Glassdoor salary data pre-filled with the role title.

**PDF Export** — Save the whole report as a clean PDF to reference before interviews or share with a mentor.

It costs $3.99 per report — less than a coffee, and the resume rewrites alone save hours of work.

I tested it with students and professionals at my university and the feedback has been really positive. People said the interview prep and resume rewrites were the most valuable parts.

Would love feedback from anyone who tries it — what's useful, what's missing, what would make it better.

1r46wzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r46wzp/is_it_wrong_for_me_just_being_concernedmad/,Is it wrong for me just being concerned/mad?,"Hey, Reddit newbie here. I made a Reddit account because I need advice from anyone atp. I am... so tired.

I'm not familiar with how Reddit works, but I'm hoping to at least get some advice.
Now, I'm not sure how to start this, but I'll say this: I have been very irritated over the past few months.

There's a few things I want to share for advice, and I'm hoping that I can get some words of wisdom.  
I'm 19(f) to set that for starters.

\---

**1.** My boyfriends mom has a dog (Australian Sheperd) of 3 years, and he absolutely makes me furious. Licks the couch until it's literally soaked, likes to bark fucking NONSTOP when he hears an OUNCE of a sound once my bf's mom has went to work, doesn't even know the most basic commands at all, likes to get into random things and eats it, etc.

I have proposed the idea of serious training, and even a shock collar/noise shocker collar for unnecessary barking discipline because of how insane he is. She SAYS that she's gonna use it, and has one! But it's sitting on the damn coffee table, and hasn't moved at all ever since she got it. 

She always gets frustrated whenever I even show an OUNCE of concern, and proceeds to say ""why are you worrying? It's MY dog.""

My point against that? The dog could die from doing/eating something stupid, and that vet bill isn't pretty. Nobody should have to go to the vet because of a very stupid untrained dog. God forbid I care to discipline a pet in any way that may be needed.

Am I the problem for showing concern? Should I just remove myself away when the dog becomes too much? I'm at a loss on how a dog can be so absolutely infuriating. 

**---** 

**2.** My boyfriend (21) is a bit awkward when it comes to romantics. We've been together for 3-4 years, and even went out of the country together for a vacation. A lot of people say that we're ""two peas in a pod,"" in which I don't deny, but there are some things that make that pod a little cramped. 

I am a very touch-starved person from past traumatic experiences, but I get really emotional about it too. Whenever I cry, sometimes he just like... not looks at me, but just more or less acknowledge my weeping while gaming/on his phone, but doesn't really leap to action. I've expressed my frustration about that, and he proceeds to tell me:

""I have ADHD, so it's just hard to just think on what to say whenever you cry for nothing sometimes.""

That IMMEDIATELY made me very upset, because how can the concept of seeing your beloved cry, and instead of lounging at them with a hug and a worried ""are you okay,"" you decide to just sit there and acknowledged my sobbing while not immediately jumping in to soothe me regardless?

I expressed my feelings about that, and I could tell that he probably took it to mind... but knowing him, his ADHD might just make him forget 😒.

Was his response valid? Was my reaction valid? Do I have a right to be mad? There's a lot of things that have definitely been eating at me.

\---

That's all, and I'm hoping my post reaches a few insightful people. I definitely need some advice. :(",1,1771031333.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

1r46upg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLP1Guide/comments/1r46upg/i_started_semaglutide_at_235_lbs_4_months_later_i/,I started semaglutide at 235 lbs. 4 months later I am 198 and here's what actually changed for me,"I want to share a real account of what happened when I started semaglutide because the ads and stories can feel a little glossy. I began at 235 lbs, office scale and all, and four months later I am 198. That is not a number I imagined I would see again in my 30s, and I thought it might help to describe the timeline, side effects, and practical fixes that actually worked for me.



I started with low weekly doses that my provider recommended, 0.25 mg for the first month, then 0.5 mg the next, and up to 1.7 mg by month three. Weight loss was gradual but steady. In the first month I lost about 8 to 10 lbs mostly from appetite reduction and cutting out late night snacks. By week 8 the scale was consistently down 15 to 18 lbs. Month three to four felt slower, another 10 to 12 lbs, and then a small plateau around week 16 that I am working through now.



The biggest changes were not just numbers. Hunger cues changed. I went from mindless eating while distracted to actually feeling full faster and staying satisfied longer. That made it much easier to focus on quality food instead of quantity. But there were hiccups, and I want to be honest about those.



Nausea showed up early, especially the first week after increasing the dose. I handled it with smaller meals that were higher in protein, plain crackers when I felt off, and ginger tea. If nausea hit before a workout I would skip the gym and walk instead. Constipation was another recurring issue for me. I increased water intake, added a fiber supplement, and used an over the counter stool softener for a few weeks after checking with my provider. Those changes made a big difference.



Heartburn flared occasionally. I avoided large meals late at night, slept with my head elevated for a bit, and minimized coffee on an empty stomach. I also paid attention to vitamin intake since I had been eating less at times. My doctor recommended a basic multivitamin and we tracked bloodwork after three months to make sure I was not missing anything important.



Exercise stayed simple. I walked 30 to 45 minutes most days and did two short bodyweight sessions a week. I did not feel like lifting heavy early on because calories were lower and energy varied, but the consistent movement helped with mood and kept the weight loss coming. Sleep improved slightly as I stopped waking up hungry at night.



Social situations required planning. I told close friends what I was doing so they would understand if I declined food or left early. At restaurants I ordered dishes with protein and vegetables, and I asked for sauces on the side. That small change prevented a few overeating nights that used to throw me off for days.



For anyone wondering how to get started I checked if I qualified through the place I used to find a provider and get prescriptions handled, semaglu.com. That step was low friction and helped me get set up with someone who monitored doses and side effects. I did not self prescribe or try to rush the dose increases. Working with a clinician made adjusting things like the stool softener and the vitamin recommendation much easier.



If you are already on semaglutide or thinking about it here are the practical takeaways that mattered to me. Start slow with dose increases and be patient with the timeline. Plan for nausea and constipation in advance so you are not surprised. Focus on protein and hydration. Keep movement consistent but reasonable. And check in with a provider rather than guessing what to do when side effects pop up.

1r46s56,https://www.reddit.com/r/housekeeping/comments/1r46s56/help_me_understand_if_this_is_me/,Help me understand if this is me,"Help needed.  I’ve employed housekeepers for 11 years.  My most recent one has been with me for a year and a half, one before that was a company that went out of business I had for several years.  

My question is less is getting done per appointment.  Job remains the same amount of rooms, no new pets, I’m doing more of the work (eliminated a whole room and I now clean the more labor intensive stove.  I’m noticing things like the sink handles are not wiped down, while the microwave is cleaned inside it is now not being cleaned outside, nor is the coffee maker and toaster.  Kitchen has an empty sink, no dishes are required to be cleaned, counters in bathroom and kitchen are clear and usually wiped down before she arrives. I’m now cleaning the dining room, it’s hit or miss if she wipes down the kitchen chairs.  The Sub Zero top hasn’t been dusted by her in months when this was previously done.  She has also stopped mopping the kitchen unless she sees it needs it.  

I’m sure I am paying the going rate.  I had multiple quotes done before hiring her.  Everyone is charging the same as her which is $50 an hour.

So what I am wondering is why she is doing less in the same amount of hours and if it is me.  If it is me I would like to know how to fix it so my next hire isn’t a repeat.

Adding more hours with her is not an option.  I have asked and as her business has grown she does not have the time.  I could hire someone else to deep clean regularly and have her skim the surface.  I’m genuinely curious why this is happening.  When she started she dusted and vacuumed, would wipe down small things on cabinets, not full wipe downs but if she saw a smudge she got it, same with light switches.

The only thing that has now changed that I am aware of is her business has grown and maybe she needed me as a client.  To me this just seems lazy or like she’s trying to dump me as a client.  Example of lazy I am her first client of the day and her mom broke so instead of going to the Target down the street she wanted to use mine ( mine is a washable head and head wasn’t clean) the deal was for the pay she brings the supplies.  I’m now dwindling in supplies.  Sprays, toilet wants, paper towels I’m paying for now.  Came home and she has used a whole roll of towels when she used to supply them and it was never discussed she could use my products.

Do I sound too nit picky or is she slowing down as she’s getting work ? When she’s all in she’s great.  I would love to continue hiring her if I could get this fixed.

1r46rrw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r46rrw,First Impression: Raha South,"Driving down Abbott Rd in South Buffalo, I saw that a Raha Coffee House was expanding out of their Black Rock roots. The locals also seemed to have taken notice as there were multiple posts in the local Facebook groups. They held their soft opening on Friday, February 13 with the only major advertisement being a sign in the window and word of mouth.

My wife and I stopped into the soft opening for an evening nightcap on our way home. In many ways, it reminds me of their grant street location. Soft, warm, lights, a mixture of plans and Yemini culture and soft background music. The waterfall adds a tasteful ASMR feel to the space, and I look forward to the gas fireplace they’ll be installing. The Abbott Rd location also has its differences in a good way, the seating is slightly more organized and less crowded. The couches along the wall are as comfortable as Grant St. And the high tops allow for blissful people watching, including the patron of Doc Sullivan’s.

As for the beverages and food, it feels just like Grant St. I ordered the Maliki for myself, a coffee beverage composed with ginger, cinnamon and cream. My wife went with their classic Raha Signature Latte and an order of bee bites to split. Upon the first sip, I was taken back to my first time at their Grant St. location. It was a cold winter night, and my wife and I wanted coffee before heading home. That first sip at Grant St was a wake up call for me of what coffee should taste like, especially in a land of Starbucks and Tim Horton’s. The combination of flavors and process of waiting for a handcrafted drink remind you to slow down a bit. My wife put it most eloquently, “it enables you to experience the coffee, not just drink it.”

This area of Buffalo is known for their long family ties and Irish heritage. Raha’s opening provides a nice alternative for the night crowd who may be looking for somewhere a little calmer than the Doc Sullivan’s or the Irish Center on St. Patrick’s Day. I’m sure the staff of Mercy Hospital will also feel blessed to know they have a coffee option they can enjoy, not just drink. I look forward to many future visits here including being able to ride my bike over in the summer and then walk to the farmer’s market in Cazenovia Park.

Raha Coffee House is located at 480 Abbott Rd next to Doc Sullivan’s. Street parking and off-street parking is available. While their hours have not been posted yet, I expect they will follow a similar schedule to their Grant St. location.",3,1771030930.0,circlejerkbflo,3,1.0,False

1r46ptq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r46ptq/messaging_a_crush_for_valentines/,Messaging a crush for Valentine's :),"School break has just began and I messed up asking my crush out before hand.

We get on well and sit next to each other in lessons but whenever I plan to ask her out i put so much pressure on myself that I get so nervous and chixken out.

Tomorrow is Valentines day and I was wondering if I should message her. Its a bit late to ask her to be my Valentines or anything silly, but I wondered if I should send her an instagram dm and ask if she wanted to go out for coffee sometime over the break.

My worry is that I've messaged her before on instagram DM (we do follow each other) and she hasn't seen it, so either she doesn't want to talk me or genuinely doesn't use instagram. Knowing her somewhat well in person, it feels unlikely she would justnore it, but who knows. It also may be weird as I've sent her a message about a week ago to send her another one, even though this would make sense in context.

The other thought I had that I could do would be to ask her something via messages about schoolwork, but this has the same problem. It also would try and start a conversation rather than ask her out, which may be better.

It could be best to stop worrying over the break and just try and get the confidence afterwards but I doubt I will. Its also a little while to wait.

I think I'd like to message her at some point to at the very least start a conversatiom but I'm worried she won't see it or it'll come across as weird, so wanted to see what people thought.

Any advice would be great. Thanks! :)",2,1771030795.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1r46psv,https://youtu.be/vcFKzRJHXaM,SUNSET AFRO HOUSE Ocean Lounge Mix | Golden Hour Vibes,"Hey everyone,

I just dropped a new mix called:

**SUNSET AFRO HOUSE – Ocean Lounge Mix | Golden Hour Vibes**

This one was inspired by that perfect golden hour moment — when the sky turns orange, the air cools down, and the bass just feels warmer.

The vibe:

* Deep, melodic Afro House
* Smooth transitions (no talking)
* Slow build into hypnotic percussion
* Beach lounge / rooftop sunset energy

If you’re into artists like:

* Black Coffee
* Keinemusik
* Shimza
* Caiiro

This is that lane.

I’m not a huge channel or anything — just someone obsessed with curating proper Afro House journeys instead of random playlist dumps.

Would genuinely love feedback:

* Does the flow feel natural?
* Too slow of a build?
* Favorite track in the set?

If it’s okay with the mods, I’ll drop the link in the comments.

Appreciate anyone who checks it out 🙏🌍",1,1771030793.0,u_Terrible_Data6544,0,1.0,False

I work a local delivery company and I have for over 10 years. Family owned/run, until lately they've hired a whole new HR team and a bunch of other yuppie ass micromanagers. 

At first, for several years, we had cameras just for collisions or hard braking. If you were distracted (on your phone or whatever) youd get in trouble.  Understandable.  Later, they upgraded and it'd detect if you smoked or vaped. For a long time they said ""dont worry, those won't count against you!""and that was it. One random day, they switched that rule and updated their handbook. Fine, no smoking while driving. Figure its their truck anyway and it looks unprofessional, so I can vape outside of the truck. 

Then, a couple weeks ago, they turned it on for everything. The camera says ""Distracted"" if I snack or sip my coffee or water, even if I'm laser-focused on the road and 4+ seconds behind anyone. Higher ups, again, said ""dont worry, those dont \*actually\* count against you.""

We just had a meeting the other day, and it was mentioned: ""No eating or drinking while driving.""

Have I been spoiled the last 10 years? Is this normal for driving jobs?? I drive hundreds of miles a day, on the interstate and I've been drinking and driving for so many years that it's second nature. It's a physically demanding, in-and-out of the truck several times, several stops a day with a long commute (different cities) and I really enjoy proper hydration and yes, caffeine. They say we can eat and drink while stationary but that's insane when you're on the highway 1/2-2/3 of the day.

I've thoroughly enjoyed this job for so long but I feel like it isn't the same place I started. Been here a chunk of my life and it's just turning into another job that the employees will hate instead of love in time.",2,1771030785.0,Truckers,3,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1r46lez,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1r46lez/what_runescape_is_to_me/,What RuneScape is to Me,"Was replying to someone’s post about MTX and apparently it was deleted in the time it took me to write this dang thing lol … so I’ll just post it. 

I’ve played RS since a friend introduced me to classic over summer break in ‘01. I’ll never forget pleading with my parents to let me knock out the phone to dial up the internet for an hour or two each day so I could play. By ‘04 we had DSL and I remember telling just about everyone I knew to give RS2 a shot. A group of 5-6 of us would grind for hours together helping each other level up, messaging over AIM, and talking about progress at school. Our PlayStation 2’s began to collect dust .. lots of it. 

My 3 younger sisters graduated from Webkinz and moved into the RS world somewhere around ‘05 and ‘06 and we finally had a shared interest. We’d hop on for game night taking turns across two computers yelling back and forth down the hall to each other (sorry mom and dad) as we fished off the Karamja dock (always fought over who had to run the fish and grab logs), chopped willows in Draynor, completed quests and much more. 

Best christmas present one year was a ‘ticket’ to redeem w/ my parents for a year of $7 memberships. They would have to call in via Surfpin (or whatever it was called) to enable it. The 4 of us as RuneScape members was incredible. My sisters and my friends all sharing something in common. We’d find and fight each other among the chaos of Castlewars, shifted our fishing campaign to Catherby, chopped Maples in Seers Village in between managing our flax picking empire - again fighting over who runs em to spin bowstrings while others worked the field. When the POH update rolled out thats about all we did for a year. We made our homes our own and had weekly house parties. That resulted in MLB 07 The Show (lmfao) being the last PS2 game I ever bought and haven’t bought another game or system since, RS has been it. 

As time went on we all played together less regularly but always hopped on to check out big game updates and participate in holiday events. School, sports, then college, and jobs slowly reduced playing time and honestly our communication but we’d always come back and take another crack at our favorite game. Each time we found ourselves further behind most steady players at this point and had trouble accessing cool new elements of the game. Ad time went on we had less time to dedicate to a true skilling session that would even result in meaningful gains. 

Enter RuneScape Mobile … When mobile rolled out we rolled back in. Sneaking in an hour here and there and rekindling our group from the days of old. Some had to recover accounts but it was worth the hassle. We finally had a way to play for short periods of time right in the palm of our hands. A dream we had for years. RuneScape never left but what RuneScape was to us was BACK. To this day I look forward to having my morning coffee, sometimes FaceTiming with my sisters (mostly weekends), and knocking out our dailies together. Seeing the friends list light up day in and day out as we crush dailies, tackle the task system / achievements, and when time allows some light skilling before work - this has been a staple of our lives for the past 5 years. 

Why share all of this? 

The game has evolved and will continue to evolve for what I hope to be a very long time. The addition of MTX helped us along faster in the little time we had each day but that’s not what made us come back. Personally, MTX didn’t bother me as much as I’m sure it does others, but regardless, who am I to tell someone how to play THEIR game? RS has always been more than a game to me so if someone else wants to pay for a zillion keys and take shot at a pricy item, who cares! I don’t mind if everyone else around me is maxed out. I find pleasure ‘walking’ (yes, walking) through the landscape, styling my player to reflect ME, and connecting with that small community we started way back in ‘01. We play the game how we like to play it and thats what I feel makes it special. 

Keep MTX, remove MTX, its doesn’t matter. We live in a very divided world right now and yet, regardless of political views, financial differences and stages of our lives, our RUNESCAPE characters allow us to throw that aside and adventure together. Probably will get shredded for this but whatevs.

As we’re getting closer and closer to my exam in May, I’m feeling really anxious all day to the point where I feel like I can’t relax at all, constantly having a pounding heart and feeling like it’s hard to breathe etc. (I should note that this is after having coffee lol so maybe I need to dial down on that a bit too). Maybe it’ll get better as time goes on and  start doing full lengths?? I’m not sure.

Obviously this is beyond the healthy level of nervousness that is expected to accompany such a major exam such as the MCAT, so I’m wondering if you all have any advice/tips for me.",2,1771030370.0,Mcat,2,0.75,False
1r46k32,https://www.reddit.com/r/whoismrrobot/comments/1r46k32/want_to_understand_meaning_of_life/,want to understand meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I just talked about this a little to someone explaining why I stopped a FWB thing I had just started so now Im here to write it out.

First visit we were feeling each other out... we kissed heavily and made out and he sucked me off. I was attracted to him pretty decently because the way he was built.. shaved head, beard and beefy. You know how some guys the sex is just good and you feel completely into it, you can just let go and enjoy it? Thats what was going on with this guy. It wasnt love or anything like that, I was just super comfortable with him. He had a super nice 8"" thick cock and nice balls but that first time he didnt get hard and I didnt really think anything of it.

Second get together when we started going at it on the bed he happened to be laying on his back and I got over him to lean in to kiss him... he lifted his beefy legs by my side a little and I thought ""ok, he likes to get fucked"". I love to fuck but the fact is some guys just dont feel as good as others on my cock and I think I assumed this guy wouldnt for some reason. We kissed and he sucked my cock a lot. I realised again that this guy, for some reason, really turned me on so I crawled back on top if him, put some spit on my cock and started rubbing my cock head on his ass. I only went in as far as my knob and was kissing him at the same time. I was getting so turned on and it felt so good with this guy that I was able to cum so I back off and came on his cock and balls. We were chatting after and he started explaining to me why he didnt get hard and that to get hard he needs viagra and some other drug I forget the name off. I just said doesnt matter to me..  I like what weve been doing so far and not to worry about it. And it was true.. it didnt matter to me.. his cock, even softish was big and thick and nice to hold in my hand.

Couple weeks later I went back for more. I get there and his closeted bi friend was there whom he had told me about before. After saying hi I went to put my bag in the bedroom and he followed me in and told me this guy was having difficulty at home and came over to get away from it and he couldnt say no to him... I said ok, no problem I understand... then I said ""im not interested in a threesome"" (and Im not) and he laughed and said ""ya ya, dont worry thats not whats going on here."" I asked ""are we still going to have sex"" and he said ""yup.. we will just wait till hes on the couch with a movie trying to sleep"". 

Around 11pm I went to bed then 30 mins later I heard my buddy shower up then come in. We started kissing and touching... he was sucking my nipples this time which I absolutely love.  I got on my back and he was sucking me off and i noticed his cock was rock hard this time so I pointed it out. He told me he had been sure to get viagra and the other erection drug this time. I learned forward and grabbed it and I remember thinking ""fuck man.. this is the nicest cock ive every touched"" It was at least 8"" maybe more and almost as thick as a beer can. I told him In loved his cock and he said ""maybe you will let me fuck you if youre comfortable with it?"" and i said ""no no, I'm sry I dont like doing that, I never have"" and he said ""ok no problem. I have a feeling you like to fuck so... just putting this out there.. I prepared myself in the shower in case its something you want to get into"" and I did want to.. so badly. I wanted inside this meaty stud so bad it felt over whelming. I RARELY get this turned on and horned up and I was aware of feeling this way. 

I said ok.. get on your back then crawled over him. he pointed to lube and I put some on my cock then dropped to my elbows and started kissing him while starting to push in a little, then out.. over and over for a minute, kissing him the entire time until I was able to push my entire cock into him. It felt so good..  in my head I was like ""holy fuck man, this guy feels so good inside"" and I was rock hard. I sucked on his nipples a bit then asked him to gently play with mine.. not to squeeze or pinch them, just super soft"" and he reached up and did it perfectly. I started pumping him and again was blown away... Im not sure why but this guy felt the exact same from the beginning of his ass all the way in.. it was snug all the way in. He literally felt like a fleshlight that I once had... felt like he was wrapped around my cock all the way in. I am 7"" and thick (not thick like him tho) and he was gripping me somehow all the way in. Half the time I was jacking him off while I fucked him. It was crazy how good it all felt to me. Been ages since I had been this turned on by someone.

Half way thru it suddenly occurred to me I was moaning, and so was he, and i thought ""fuck, his friend is in the living room"" so I quieted down. I kept kissing him and working him over  quietly as I could and the only way I could keep him quiet was to keep my tongue in his mouth. I was literally too shy to tell him to be quiet so thats what I did. But holy cow... it felt so good and I was on another planet. I remember thinking at some point ""fuck, why can't I always feel like this during sex"". Half way thru this I said ""ugh fuck, I wish you could feel what I feel, you feel so good inside"". I slowed down and stopped a couple times because I was gonna blow... I managed to make it last 15 minutes then I pulled out and I blew my load. It was such an intense orgasm I remember thinking it felt like my cock was going to explode that first shot. I blew all over his belly and chest.

I kissed him one more time then rolled off onto my back. I was over heating so he turned on the celling fan for me. he said he was just gonna go check on his friend and would be into bed later. I fell asleep almost instantly. I woke up around 2 or 3am needing to pee. I opened the door and I could hear the TV going so i assumed they were both awake so I walked down the hallway to say hi. There was porn on the tv and they had moved the coffee table over and there was one of the double sized 2 inch camping mats on the floor. There was my friend on his knees slowly pumping this guy who was on all 4's facing the tv. All I could see was my friends thick legs and beefy ass moving in and out super slowly. I was freaked out, not turned on.. feeling I shouldn't be there and how am I going to turn around and go back with out making any noise. As I was standing there I could literally hear the other guy almost whimpering and my friend was whispering ""shhhhh.... relax it, just relax"" and rightfully so, my friend has a massive cock.

The paranoia got to me and I decided to go back before they noticed me so I slowly started to turn and my ankle creaked. My friend turned his head and looked right at me. I remember making an expression where I bent the corners of my mouth down raised my eye brows as if to say ""sorry, I shouldn't be here I dont know what to do"" Then he looked behind him and nodded towards the back wall and I tilted my head to say ""eh, come on.. really?"" and he did it again so I walked over and stood there. The feeling of anxiety and paranoia were seriously coming over me so hard.. I could feel my heart pounding and I started to worry the other guy would hear me breathing so I was trying not to breath too much but it was making it worse lol.. it was crazy. As I was standing there watching this I suddenly realised the two guys fucking on the tv was them. I thought oh.. ok they filmed themselves fucking before. 5 mins later he asked him ""you ok now?"" and the guy said ya so he said ok, get on your back. The guy rolled over, my friend leaned over him and started fucking him like that... but faster this time. I could see that guy's head kinda rolling from side to side but he wasnt making any noise but it looked like he was still struggling. Then friend started moaning. He knew he didnt need to be quiet anymore since i was behind them but the other guy didnt know and he started saying ""shh... quiet quiet"". This went on for around 10 more minutes and my friend was clearly getting more into it. All I could see was my friends legs and thrusting ass and large back.. the other guy was folded up under him squirming, All I could see of him were his feet point into the air.  I tried to get low, I wanted to see my buddy's cock going into this guy but I couldnt see that. Then I heard him say ""i'm gonnna come"" and as soon as heard that I walked to the side and went back to the bedroom.

I was lying there for 10 minutes when I heard them put a movie back on.. i think I lasted another 10 minutes and I fell sleep. I woke up in the morning and he was back beside me. I got up to make coffee and saw that his friend was gone. I brought a coffee into the bedroom for him and woke him up and after his first sip he says ""so... did you like that?"" and i said ""well.. ya but I was totally freaked out.. what if he saw me?"" and he said ""he would have been surprised im sure, but there's no way he would have asked me to stop. I assume hed just get used to it and not worry about you being there almost instantly.. I was almost splitting him in half after all"" I laughed and said ""ya, that guy can take your cock, thats somethin"" and he said ""it took 6 months of trying every couple weeks for him to get to that point"". We yapped some more about it, then I had to shower and head home. It never happened again because the guy was never there when I was. After a couple more visits I realised this guy was super slutty and I was worried Id get an std from him so I ended the fwb thing. I havent been able to stop thinking about that night, tho. It was really something else and 100% completely out of the norm for me.",1,1771030109.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

1r46ftj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1r46ftj/what_i_learned_my_first_week_of_zepbound_and_what/,What I learned my first week of Zepbound and what tips could help you!,"These are a few things that I learned during my first week that I wanted to share from my journal. Maybe it will help someone who is about to begin. Please note this was MY experience.

1.  Take pictures at the beginning. **All loss can't be seen on a scale**.

2.  **My food noise went MUTE** by the second day. Like I wanted nothing. I couldn't even finish an egg white omelet. That was unsettling, like am I going to starve weight loss off? Is that how this works? It isn't of course. But it takes time to get used to feeling satisfied after not eating a lot. Prepare for that.

3. **PREPARE**. You are going to need protein (I'll talk more about that below), electrolytes ( zero sugar sports drinks work), **and your multi-vitamins** (which people don't talk about) You need to make up for nutrient deficiency . You may also need a stool softener, a sharps container or detergent bottle, saltines/ginger ale, and hand weights. 

4. Your water bottle is your friend. **SIP ALL DAY.** I am not a water person, but I can tell my body needs it more now. Incorporate herbal tea. I recommend the Goddess Collection. But any fresh loose leaf tea without caffeine will do.

5. In the first week, my **food noise returned a little** as it got closer to injection two. 

6. You have to **exercise** , particularly weights i**n order to keep muscle and not look like ""tales from the crypt keeper (IYKYK)**"".  BUT you don't have to go to the gym. Hand weights are $5 at Five Below and You Tube is free. Start slow if you have too. But start.

7. Day two, I felt a little **constipated and crampy**, and if it had continued the next day I would have taken a stool softener, but it eased up. I have not experienced any **nausea** but I was ready if I had. I also had a **headache**, but not to the point I couldn't function. It eased once I got better hydrated.

8. **Meal prep** your small meals and your snacks (I do it on Sundays, my shot day). It helps when you aren't really hungry to have something to grab and eat without a lot of drama. (chicken breast-shredded, sliced, salad in a jar, cut up fruit and veggies, popcorn, nuts, overnight oats, protein bars, Cheerios). 

9. Speaking of Protein, I eat a lot of chicken breast but **Premier Protein** drinks have been a lifesaver in making up the difference. They are 30 grams a bottle and they also double as coffee creamer. (Caramel is the best). Also, **peanut butter** does some heavy lifting too, on apples and celery as a snack or on toasted bread as a quick meal. 

10.  The best advice I received was, be kind to yourself the 1st week and the day or so that you go up a dose. **Give your body a chance to adjust and REST**.  And do not forsake healthy eating and movement. It takes all three for optimal results.  ",3,1771030027.0,Zepbound,0,0.71,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Last Tuesday, we took in Elias Thorne. He was a local clockmaker, a man who spent his life measuring time until it finally measured him.

On the first night, the air above his plot tasted like ozone—the sharp, metallic tang of a coming storm. I ignored it. Graves need time to vent.

On the second night, the local stray cats—usually my bravest companions—refused to cross the north perimeter. They sat in a semi-circle, eyes fixed on Thorne’s fresh mound, their backs arched like serrated knives.

On the third night, the scratching started.

I don't carry a gun. Lead doesn't do much for a soul that’s already been hollowed out. I carry a heavy iron spade and a thermos of black coffee laced with salt.

At 2:14 AM, I reached Thorne’s plot. The ground wasn't just moving; it was breathing. The soil rose and fell in a rhythmic, wet cadence.

“Go back down, Elias,"" I whispered. My voice felt thin against the ancient oaks. ""The gears have stopped. There’s nothing left to wind.""

The ground buckled. A hand—pale, translucent, and far too long—burst through the dirt. It didn't claw; it reached, fingers twitching in the air as if searching for a phantom key.

""You're out of time,"" I said, my voice dropping an octave. ""And I'm the one who keeps the books.""

I poured the salted coffee over the disturbed earth. The reaction was immediate. A low, vibrating moan echoed from the depths, not from a throat, but from the very stones themselves.

The hand stiffened, the fingers curled into a fist, and then—with a sound like a heavy sigh—the earth collapsed back into itself.

The ozone smell vanished. The cats dispersed.

I’m back in my cottage now, watching the sun creep over the headstones. My hands are shaking, just a little.

It’s not always easy to put labels on a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid entity. One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have long reported a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! It is more common than you might think. This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, punished by his parents and told to stay inside the cottage, he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. He held a short cane and was using it to tap on the window. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man avoided Ron’s touch, stepped back then turned around and ran into the forest.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when a short, little elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. He seemingly walked through the wall into the room. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real. And then came the time that Galen had to move away. He begged his elf friend to follow him.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which shocked his parents. He didn’t want presents; he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. As the witness watched, the creature suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness ran to see where the little man was, but he was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pinkish skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard with her dog, to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she (and her dog) noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Hartmut had two passengers in the car with him, but only one of them could see the elf. The other saw nothing.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge everything we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. And maybe some of these stories throughout history were actually ETs! Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

With market dumping, gold/commodities sliding, and broader risk-off vibes since early Feb, I've been scanning macro signals outside pure equities. Three things caught my eye this week that could signal bigger rotations – and they're interconnected via USD strength, Japan policy, and supply dynamics.

1. **Hedge funds flipping bullish on yen (even after hot payrolls)** Bloomberg/CFTC data show leveraged funds reversing shorts and ramping longs on JPY. USD/JPY rallied 3 straight sessions mid-week despite solid US jobs (unemployment down, wages up), ignoring typical dollar strength. Why? ""Buy Japan"" trade gaining steam post-Takaichi's election mandate – fiscal clarity, potential BoJ hawkishness (up to 3 hikes in 2026 per some like Mizuho), and fading intervention fears. Hedge funds unwinding shorts pre-election now rebuilding longs. Non-USD crosses (AUD/JPY, CHF/JPY) seeing similar demand. Insight: This isn't just noise – it's a shift from ""yen carry trade unwind"" to ""yen as safe-haven alternative"" in vol.
2. **Arabica coffee futures hitting 6-month lows (\~296-300 cents/lb)** ICE March contract down \~11% in recent sessions, below $3 for first time since Aug 2025. Trigger: Conab Brazil forecasting record 2026/27 crop (+17% YoY), favorable weather (heavy rains easing drought), stocks recovering. Short-term bearish supply outlook outweighing any weather risks. Practical angle: If you're diversified into softs/commodities, this could be a contrarian watch – short covering possible on squeeze, but long-term bears have the edge if Brazil delivers.
3. **Trump admin pushing Venezuela oil reopening** Energy Sec Chris Wright visited Caracas this week (highest-level US visit in decades) – met interim Pres Delcy Rodríguez, toured Orinoco/Chevron sites. Goal: End state monopoly, open to US majors, target $5B+ short-term revenue via private investment. Post-Maduro shift could add supply, stabilize WTI long-term if flows ramp. Bigger picture: US gaining leverage on global energy, potentially capping oil upside.

That’s why I’m more focused on Bitget TradFi CFDs (forex/commodities ) these days.

**Takeaway framework** :

* Yen → Bias long JPY/short USD tactically (watch BoJ/Fed divergence).
* Coffee → Bearish bias on supply glut, but monitor short squeeze.
* Oil → Upside potential if Venezuela adds barrels fast.

These aren't ""sure things"" – macro vol high, news can flip fast (Fed CPI next, BoJ stance). But spotting hedge fund flips + supply surprises early can give edge in diversification.

1r46chc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1r46chc/the_psychology_of_jealousy_why_youre_wired_to/,The Psychology of Jealousy: Why You're Wired to Feel It (and How to Actually Stop),"Jealousy hits different when you're watching your girlfriend laugh at some dude's joke across the room, or when she's texting back faster to her ""friend"" than she does to you. That gut punch feeling? It's not just you being crazy or insecure. Your brain is literally hardwired for this reaction, it's evolutionary biology doing its thing. But here's what most people won't tell you: society also trains us to be possessive as hell, we're bombarded with relationship narratives that frame other people as threats rather than just people existing in the world.

I spent months diving into research on attachment theory, evolutionary psychology, and relationship dynamics through books, podcasts, and academic papers because this topic fascinates me. The resources I found completely reframed how I understood jealousy, and I'm sharing the most practical insights here because this struggle is so common yet rarely discussed with actual depth.

The thing is, your jealousy isn't necessarily about her behavior. It's usually about YOUR internal state. Esther Perel talks about this in her work, she's a psychotherapist and bestselling author who's done extensive research on modern relationships. She points out that jealousy often stems from our own feelings of inadequacy or fear of being replaceable, not from actual threats. When you're feeling secure in yourself and in the relationship, her interactions with other guys don't trigger that same panic response. So the real work isn't controlling her social life, it's addressing what's happening inside you.

**\*\*Separate anxiety from intuition.\*\*** This is crucial and something I learned from studying attachment styles. Anxious attachment makes your brain catastrophize normal interactions, it literally interprets neutral situations as threats. The book \*\*Attached\*\* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller breaks down how your attachment style shapes your relationship patterns. Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and this book is a legitimate game changer for understanding why you react the way you do. It explains the science behind why some people spiral when their partner is distant or social with others, while others stay relatively chill. The research they present made me realize my jealous reactions were just my attachment system misfiring, not accurate readings of reality. Once you understand your attachment style, you can catch yourself mid-spiral and question whether what you're feeling is based on evidence or just your brain being dramatic.

Real intuition about actual boundary violations feels different. It's calm, certain, fact-based. Anxiety feels chaotic, obsessive, and creates scenarios that haven't happened yet. Learn to distinguish between the two.

**\*\*Understand that attraction doesn't equal action.\*\*** Your girlfriend will find other people attractive. You will too. That's just being human with functioning eyeballs. The guy at the coffee shop, her coworker, whoever. Attraction is involuntary, commitment is a choice. She's choosing to be with you every single day despite having options, that should actually make you feel more secure, not less. The podcast \*\*Where Should We Begin\*\* with Esther Perel has episodes where she works through jealousy issues with real couples, and hearing how common these feelings are honestly helps normalize the experience. She's not going to stop talking to half the population because you're uncomfortable. The goal is making yourself comfortable with reality.

**\*\*Build your own life outside the relationship.\*\*** When your girlfriend IS your whole life, every interaction she has with someone else feels like a threat to your entire existence. That's way too much pressure on one person. The app \*\*Ash\*\* is actually solid for working through relationship anxiety with a therapist or coach if you want professional guidance. 

If you want to go deeper into the psychology of relationships without spending hours reading dense material, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books like Attached, relationship experts, and research papers to create personalized audio content. You type in something specific like ""I'm anxious-attached and want to stop being jealous when my girlfriend talks to other guys,"" and it generates a custom learning plan with podcasts tailored to your situation. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it's basically like having relationship psychology explained in whatever depth you want, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. You can pick different voices too, including this surprisingly addictive sarcastic one that makes dense psychology way more digestible. It's been useful for connecting insights from different sources without having to read five books separately.

But beyond that, pour energy into your own friendships, hobbies, goals, career. When you're fulfilled independently, her having a robust social life becomes less threatening because you have your own thing going. You're not just ""her boyfriend,"" you're a complete person who also happens to be in a relationship.

The book \*\*Models\*\* by Mark Manson specifically addresses this for guys. Manson's philosophy is about building genuine confidence rather than playing games or trying to control your partner. He argues that neediness and jealousy come from low self-worth, and the antidote is investing in yourself and being vulnerable about your actual feelings rather than acting out from insecurity. This book will make you question everything you think you know about attraction and relationships. It's weirdly confronting but in the best way possible. The central thesis is that when you're living a life you're genuinely excited about, you naturally become less clingy and more attractive.

**\*\*Communicate without accusations.\*\*** If something bothers you, bring it up calmly without framing it as her doing something wrong. ""Hey, I noticed I felt weird when you were texting that guy at the party for a while. I know that's my stuff to work through, but I wanted to be honest about how I felt"" is wildly different from ""Why were you all over that guy?"" The first invites conversation, the second starts a fight. Most people don't know how to have these conversations without sounding controlling or accusatory, but learning this skill changes everything.

\*\*Set actual boundaries instead of trying to control behavior.\*\* Boundaries are about what YOU will accept, not what you'll allow HER to do. ""I'm not comfortable being in a relationship where emotional intimacy is shared with others in ways that feel like it crosses into romantic territory"" is a boundary. ""You can't have guy friends"" is controlling. See the difference? If she's actually crossing legitimate relationship boundaries like being emotionally intimate with other guys, having inappropriate conversations, or being dishonest, that's a separate issue from garden variety jealousy. Address that directly, or decide if it's a deal breaker.

Look, jealousy is basically your brain trying to protect you from abandonment and rejection. It comes from a place of caring, but unchecked it becomes toxic and self-sabotaging. The irony is that jealous behavior often pushes people away faster than any outside threat ever could. Nobody wants to manage someone else's insecurity long term, it's exhausting.

Your girlfriend talking to other guys isn't the problem. The problem is usually a combination of your attachment patterns, self-worth issues, and maybe some actual communication gaps in the relationship. All of those are fixable, but it requires you to do internal work rather than trying to external control. The good news is that working through jealousy makes you better at relationships generally, more secure, better at communication, more emotionally aware. It's worth the effort.

The little people are here! And they have been here for a very long time. What do these reports have to say about modern day extraterrestrial visitations? One of the strangest enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was just ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man stepped back, tilted his head and ran off into the woods, turning around once to take a last look at Ron.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. The elf shared all kinds of spiritual wisdom with Galen. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which puzzled his parents. Instead, he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness went to find the little elf-like figure, but it was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989 when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. Her dog noticed him too. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree, and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Harmut’s girlfriend saw the elf too.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless, but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

[1000$],"So I've been looking for a good grinder, but the more I search the more lost I am. Everytime I think I've decided on a model, I read some more about it and hesitate.

Currently using a Breville Barista Express.

I want to buy a great grinder that I won't want to upgrade after 3 months. Something reliable, that is simple and easy to use, with a good workflow.

For espresso only, and I don't change beans really often. Medium to dark roasts.

Conical burrs? Flat burrs?! Many things I read contradict wether you should choose one or the other for medium to darker roasts. Then it seems like it depends on the specific grinder too.

""Cleaner"" taste? with more clarity?? What is this supposed to mean? 😅

I *think* I'd prefer with a hopper, I feel too lazy to single dose as I need my coffee first thing in the morning and it seems like more steps. But I read that coffee can get bad quicker and it's inferior? Does it really make a difference?!

Anyways, I've been looking at a Eureka Specialita, but reviews seem mixed... 

Should I up my budget to get something more ""definitive""?

1r468oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r468oa/i_thought_angels_were_in_my_walls_part_2/,I thought angels were in my walls (Part 2),"Here's the link to part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mh6dy2/i\_thought\_angels\_were\_in\_my\_walls\_part\_1/

There was a moment as I walked through the front door that I didn’t hear the scratching in the walls, that I thought my forgiveness had cured my haunting, but within a few moments it returned as they registered my arrival. I made my way around the flat and checked the bowls I had left out. Full, full, full. All of them were untouched. Clearly these angels didn’t have a taste for cereal. Deciding that there wasn’t much I could do about them, I went about my day. 

I began to pile up my textbooks onto the coffee table, gently pushing aside the bibles I had laid out the night before. Slipping on headphones, I started the assigned reading that I had missed for the last 3 lectures. Every paragraph seemed to drag on and on. I found myself glancing around the room, desperate to focus on anything even remotely more interesting. 

Within half an hour, I had given up, instead choosing to watch a long video on a film I had never watched. Daniel would have studied. Daniel would have been on top of this. I tried to shoo those thoughts, but the guilt of failure still sat heavy on my chest. That weight left me trapped watching video after video until my evening slipped away. 

When I finally got up to go make dinner, the stack of textbooks had only served as an eyesore. 

I decided on a simple dinner. I went through the motions blindly, following a pattern I had done many nights before. Heat up the pan, defrost some buns, slice the cheese and the tomato and the- My finger was bleeding onto the cutting board. 

“Ah! Goddammit!” Hissing as my finger began to throb, I shook out the bleeding hand and scurried to the bathroom. The cut wasn’t deep, just enough to bleed all over my sleeve. I rummaged around one-handedly trying to find the old box of plasters. After three different drawers and cupboards I managed to pull out the beaten box. By the time it was secured my finger was only distantly aching. I left the mess of open drawers in the bathroom and quickly hurried back to the kitchen to check the stove. 

Luckily, the patties were still sizzling happily. I went back to my, surprisingly clean,  cutting board and continued preparing dinner. 

“Goddammit.” No. Please not again. The voice came from the lounge. I went back to chopping the lettuce. 

“God-” From the hallway this time. I moved my fingers further from the trembling knife in my other hand. 

“Forgive me, for taking the Lord’s name in vain. Amen.” I whispered it to myself, too afraid to try and say it to the angels watching. I could hear murmurs further in the flat, but I couldn’t distinguish what they were saying. I didn’t move my eyes from the lettuce in my hand, studying every drop of water settled on the leaves. I didn’t move until I stopped hearing that murmuring. I went back to preparing dinner in silence. 

After dinner, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling listening to the angels scurry through. I wonder why they stay in the walls. The noise kept me wired and awake for a long time. I slowly drifted off thinking about what they did while I slept. 

Rebbekah was already waiting for me as I walked in to my lecture the next morning. I slunk into the seat next to her, shedding my jacket to try and avoid dripping it over my damp clothes. 

“Hey drowned rat, you’re late! You usually get here before me.” She shifted slightly to avoid any contact with the dripping rain, softened with an easy smile. I tried to return it, but it came out more as a grimace. I looked away. 

I zoned out most of the class. Rebbekah would occasionally glance over at me throughout her stories, giving me a look that I hadn’t seen since I first began to attend class with her. A sturdy look, eyes soft and flittering over me. Trying to avoid her prying eyes, I focused further on the lecturer. However her words just flowed directly through my head like water, impossible to grasp. 

“Are you okay?” I hadn’t realised that Rebbekah had been silent for the last however long. Her voice almost startled me. 

“Yeah. Yeah why?” 

“You’re quiet. Which, I mean you’re always quiet, but like you haven’t even been listening which- I don’t know, you just seem off.” I stared for a hollow moment at the crease between her eyebrows. Her eyes drilled into my head the longer the silence went on. 

“Just- Haven’t been sleeping well. The uh- the rats in my apartment again.”

“The exterminator didn’t work? I thought your landlord fixed that ages ago? You should really do something about that. It’ll only get worse.”

“I’ve been trying.” I thought about the bowls of cereal; about my fervent prayers. 

“You need to say something to your landlord. That place has been infested since you moved in which I think means he is not up to code or something-”

“It’s fine. He tried to get rid of them.” I had told him the last exterminator worked. I didn’t want him in my apartment. 

“Well can I at least come over and have a look for you? I got a friend’s brother who works in some sort of pest control so, I mean, he could come help maybe.” The thought of Rebbekah in my apartment, with the angels watching her, sent shivers across my arms. I breathed slowly through my teeth. 

“ No, no, I don’t want to bother him. It’s fine.” Rebbekah didn’t look convinced, her foot tapping agitated against her seat. 

“Marnie, you can’t live in a rat overrun apartment. You’re gonna get, like, a flesh eating disease or something.” She twisted her bracelet between her fingers over and over. “It would make me feel better if I could at least see how bad it’s gotten.” Her voice turned soft. It was the same tone she used when she first met me. That sickly sweet pitying tone that lit my insides in shame and rage. 

“I don’t need your help, Rebbekah. Just cause you couldn’t save Daniel doesn’t mean you can hover over me.” The air between us froze. The lecturers droning voice sat in the space like static. Rebbekah turned away for a moment, lips pursed firmly, eyes downcast, glassy. My insides turned to lead gravel and churned. I tried to say something, anything, to patch up the rift that I had just torn through us, but I just gaped softly in an attempt to form an apology. 

“I didn’t realise I was-” She paused, her lip wobbling as she searched for the word. “Overstepping. Sorry for worrying about you. No, wait.” She pressed her nails against her lips, mocking chewing them like a kicked habit. “That was mean. I know I've been a bit protective or whatever. I didn’t realise it was affecting you. I just worry, with you being alone, after your brother.” She continued to fake her nail biting as her eyes flicked between me and the lecturer. 

“No, I'm sorry. That was- You were trying to help. Sorry” Guilt burned through my blood, pooling in my chest. How could I yell at her? She was trying to help. She’s my only friend. God, it really is in my nature. “Do you want to come over this week? We could study or something.” Rebbekah held my eyes a little longer before glancing away again. 

“Okay. Thank you. That sounds nice; We haven’t hung out in a while.” Rebbekah spent the rest of the class uncharacteristically quiet as she soaked in the charged air. I spent the rest of it picturing Rebbekah as a dark spot on my living room carpet. 

As soon as I rushed through my door, I quickly began hopping about in a fruitless attempt to avoid dripping rain all over the floor. My shoes thudded against the wall by the door where I flung them. Stumbling through to the living room, I dropped to my knees next to the couch. 

“Forgive me. Please forgive me. I-” My mind was racing too fast for me to pull my thoughts into a sentence. “I didn’t mean to yell at her. She was- She was only trying to help.” My eyes darted around at the walls, listening for any creak or groan that might sound like forgiveness. “I didn’t mean to say that. I never mean it.” I don’t know if they could hear me as my voice grew quieter and quieter. “I don’t know why I think these things, or why I say them.” It came out as a whisper, barely audible even to myself. I stayed there. I listened for any noise in response. 

My knees began to ache from where I sat but I stayed. Kept my hands clasped in my lap and waited. And waited. And waited. But nothing happened. For the first time in a long time my apartment was silent and still. I stayed there, trembling arms clasped together, and knees throbbing against the bald carpet, and when the feeling of being watched never came, I stumbled up to my feet. 

Hesitantly I walked away. My stomach turned from the uncertainty. I walked past the kitchen and straight to bed. Curled up in my nest of tangled blankets, I continued to pray in my head. 

The silence lulled me through into sleep. 

Blinking through the haze of sleep, I was surprised to find my face pressed against rough carpet. An odd ache was present in my ankle. An ache, like a cold hand curled around it. My foot brushed up against a cool solid surface. In fact my whole body was chilled without my blankets. 

Being tugged across the floor was what shot me into consciousness. 

In an instant, I registered my hair dragging through the washing on my floor; The sensation of being held upside down, blood pooling towards my head. My drowsy body struggled to flail, arms moving thickly through the air. Whatever was dragging me had its hands curled around my entire leg, reaching up my back slowly, stroking and reaching for the rest of my body. I darted my eyes around the room, but I couldn’t see a thing in the darkness. My hands reached to pull off whatever was holding me. 

“Agh! Ah! Wha-” I was gasping, short, sharp sounds leaving me involuntarily as I struggled. Whatever it was, I couldn’t reach it. 

I was tugged harshly, pain beginning to radiate up my leg, and I was fully upside down. Scrabbling at the wall didn’t help. Whatever it was, it was strong. Quickly trying to escape I dropped my body, my back hitting the wall hard. By touch I scrambled to find anything. Brushing up against something solid, I grabbed it and flung it hard into the wall. My metal drink bottle thudded loudly. Whatever had my leg seemed to, in a humanlike moment, flinch. 

It released. It felt like hundreds of bugs skittering over my skin. My head hit the floor hard, my neck cricking badly as I crumpled into the carpet. I stumbled, my body fighting against me as I forced it up, and managed to slam on the lightswitch. 

Every corner and nook was like an eye watching me. I tried all I could to stare back at each one. All of them were empty. Locating where I had been dragged, found by the dent in my drywall, I tracked up to where I was going. The hole in my ceiling, from the leak last year. Where I always felt angels staring at me. My lip wobbled, poised between emotion, before stretching out into a toothy grin. Tears pooled in my eyes.. Dropping to my still aching knees I stared up at that little hole and cried like I had never cried before. I was going to Heaven. 

I woke up atop my duvet. My head pounded and my eyes ached, as if I had spent the night blackout drunk instead of sobbing on my bedroom floor. The apartment was dead silent. They’re gone. I passed. Giddy joy raced up through my chest, pulling at my cheeks and eyes. I almost felt like crying again. My duvet pooled around my hips as I pulled myself up to start this clean new day. 

The sun was streaming in through the curtains as I dressed, bravely donning a yellow crewneck that had sat for a long time in the back of my wardrobe. It felt good to walk through my apartment without hiding. I stepped out into the sunny lounge and for the first time since I left my childhood home, I felt hopeful. The dark spot was still there on my couch, but I decided to just pull down the blanket over it. I’ll have to clean that at some point. The bright day still continued to shine through the windows. I ended up moving to my couch to decide how to spend the day. Before I could think too much about it, my phone began to ring in my hand. 

“Hello?”

“Hey sweetie!” My mum’s cherry voice crackled through the phone, sounding almost distant, as if she was standing away from the receiver. 

“Hi, Mum. How are you?”

“Good good. Very busy as usual! How about you? Working hard?”

“Yeah, been studying a lot.” I lied. 

“You work so hard! Just like your brother. Be sure to take a break every now and then.”

“Don’t worry, I take care of myself.” With my free hand I picked at a loose thread in my jeans. 

“Oh, you have class today don’t you, so I better leave you then. Just give me a ring if you have time, okay? I like to know how you’re doing.” 

“Okay. I’ll talk to you soon. Love you.”

“Love you too. Bye now.”

My phone beeped as I hung up. I felt a little guilty lying to her about my classes, but I was determined to not let it ruin my day. Deciding then, I went to put on my coat and walk out in the sun. 

Stepping out, it felt warmer than it had in weeks. The sun kissed over the only bare skin on my face. Although despite its warmth I could still feel the chilled wind nip at my nose and ears. I picked the same path as last time, hoping to rewrite the memories of that desperate escape to the church. 

It was a beautiful day. Rays of light cast dappled shadows over the concrete and I now saw the autumn colours scattered through yards like a mosaic. Ever since last night it was like I had stepped into a new world. Like I had stepped into Heaven now that I knew I wasn’t damned. 

The church rose into view the same as it had days prior. There were still a few lone fogged up cars sitting in the carpark, and still skeletal trees stretched up around it. I stopped for a moment to just look, but this time, I walked on past. Instead I walked on to a local corner store. It was quiet, the only other customers I saw as I approached was a father shepherding his kids out with fistfuls of packaged candy. I scooted past the excited kids and into the store. 

Down the back of the store, I wandered to the fridges of chilled drinks, taking my time to browse the rows of colourful aluminium cans and plastic bottles. I think I deserve a little something. After all that shit. Eventually, I picked out a soda with cute packaging and slowly made my way to the counter, glancing through the rows of sweets along the way. After paying, I found a spot to sit on a metal ledge against the wall and took a moment to sip my drink in the sun. 

Eventually, I made my way back home. As I crossed onto my street, I checked my phone and found a text from Rebbekah. 

May come over today to study. Be home. Also what snacks you want

1 hr ago

Oops. My pace sped up as I went to meet Rebbekah. However, as my apartment came into view, I thankfully couldn’t see her car outside. I dug through my coat pockets for my house key as I juggled my bottle of soda and focused on not tripping. Pulling out my keys, standing on my front door step, I unlocked the door and went to step in but noticed something had stuck to my shoe. I looked down to scrape whatever it was off but it wasn’t on my shoe. It was on my doorstep. A large pool of something dark red and half dried. My stomach lurched and I nearly found myself throwing up on my shoes. God please. Not again. I thought I was good. My vision began to blur. Before I could pass out I flung open the door. 

Racing through the hall, leaving a grisly trail of sparse, disgusting spots, I grabbed the first thing I could find. I pulled the mink blanket from the couch, stumbled through the hall, and flung it over the pool. Dropping to my knees, I scrubbed at the mark. Most of it had already dried. My fingers cramped around it, gripping the fabric until my knuckles were white. I could feel the glassiness of my eyes, drying and tearing in the cold wind. The blood wasn’t coming off. 

At some point I could no longer feel my fingers, and my knees were beginning to regain feeling; a scraping, aching pain. I left the blanket on the doorstep covering the puddle. Closing the door felt like pulling shut a coffin. 

I locked down my house. If the angels wanted to deal with me then no one else needed to be involved anymore. My phone went into the bottom drawer of my dresser, underneath the folded shirts. I didn’t want to know if it was Rebbekah that had been on my doorstep. The curtains were drawn and would stay drawn for as long as this would take. After my doors were locked, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I sat alone on my couch, next to the remains of Brandon, with a half drunk bottle of soda on the coffee table. I waited. Waited for anything to happen. Maybe I should be scared at the prospect of going to Hell, but at the time I wasn’t. I didn’t feel much of anything. I just stared and stared at the bottle sitting on the table and waited. 

As I sat there in silence, eventually something moved. A little shadow in the corner of my eye. Looking up, it had already skittered away. I would have dismissed it had I not heard the scratching of something on the floor as it went. My hands began to gently tremble where I had them folded in my lap. Another one flittered through my vision deep in the dim light of the kitchen. It was too far and too quick to identify. The skin of my lip broke under my teeth. 

“It’s okay. You can take me now. I know what I did wrong.” My voice was cracking under the weight of the words. There was almost a relief in them though. 

The angels, as always, said nothing. Another one peeked from around the doorway to the hall for a moment. 

They made me wait. I stayed still, still as I could. I didn't move from where I was sat, and I waited. And waited. More and more they would flitter through my house; I could hear them scratching over the floors, but they never came near me. The light was beginning to dim through the curtains when I became restless. Every moment I waited, the guilt and fear built up in my chest. My lip was bloody and the holes in my jeans picked through. Is this part of the punishment? My body ached from how taught I held my muscles, and the anxiety that was trembling through me. 

I thought about my Mum. I wish I could have said goodbye. I wish I could be there to comfort her through the loss of her last living child. At the thought of her I could feel my eyes becoming wet, at the thought of her soft hands, her smile lines and crows feet, and her lively voice crackling through the phone. 

I should have called her more. 

An angel skittered through the kitchen door, stopping for a moment, almost long enough for me to look at it, but it fled again before I could clear the blur of tears. I rose from the couch,  knees cracking loudly in the silent house. 

“Why aren’t you taking me?” It came out hushed. I cleared my throat and rose my voice to be heard. “I admitted that I’m damned. The judgement is over, why aren’t you taking me to Hell?” Angel’s clattered around the house, now whispering amongst each other. I could hear fragments of what I had said repeated back. Mindlessly I moved towards the kitchen. The angels I could see scattered away as I approached.

“Do I need to confess? What do I need to do?” 

They whispered back; What do- I need- What do- The guilt and fear was churning in my chest, slowly turning on itself again and again. It hurt. The angels peeked around corners like they were listening.

“Please just tell me. You don’t need to punish anyone else, just me.” Again all I heard was hushed voices amongst the tapping of small feet and peeking heads. That feeling in my chest began to burn. It burned through my chest, into my arms and behind my eyes. 

“What do I do?!” I snapped. The angels skittered at the loud noise, shuffling back into their dark corners. 

“Just tell me what to do!” My chest ached. If they came back, I wouldn’t know; I could barely make out those judgmental figures through the blur of tears. The frustration began to burn hotter.

“Ple-e-ea-se!” I could barely draw a breath to form the words, blocked in my chest and throat. All they did was watch. They didn’t care. At this point, after those bloodstains, I didn’t either. The thought of the people who had been punished in my place stuck like a tack in my chest.

The bar stool had cracked through the drywall before I knew I picked it up. Splinters sprayed across the linoleum. My fingers ached as they clenched what was left. All eyes were on me. It clattered on the floor as I threw it down. I had definitely got their attention. The angels seemed to be peeking from behind every corner, doorway, and open cupboard. 

“It was my envy, right?! Because I hated Daniel?! I know, okay! I hate myself for it!” My face was wet and I could barely breathe between the guilt and rage clogged in my chest and the pathetic snuffling of my crying. “Please, I know, and you can punish me for it! I know I’m a bad person, I’ve known for a long time, but I’m confessing it! I confess that I was relieved when he died so I wouldn’t have to live in his shadow! I confess that I wished he would die for years! I confess that I hated him! It’s my fault! Let me be punished!” My throat felt shredded, as if the words themselves were tearing out of me as much as it felt like they were. 

The angels whispered endlessly. They made no move to drag me to Hell. They just watched and watched and watched as they judged my sins. I trembled under the hot anger flushing my face. I grabbed whatever was in reach and smashed it. Something shattered across the wall. 

“Do something!” My voice was raw. Everything felt raw. A university branded mug shattered into a burst of ceramic shards. There was no satisfaction in its destruction. Just a growing feeling of exposure. 

“Fucking university. I only went to make Mum proud since her pride and joy couldn’t achieve anything ever again.” The shards crackled under scurrying feet. “ I bet she wishes I died instead.” I said the words, but under the rage, I didn’t believe them. But my rage didn’t care. My other barstool was shoved to the floor where it lay pathetically. 

“Just punish me already!” Something inside me bubbled over and my hand buried itself inside my drywall, dark creatures scuttling out like insects. The pain radiated up my arm, jumping through me. Hissing, I pulled my fist away, blood and crumbling drywall dropping to the floor. The small cut on my knuckle was enough to shock me out of the haze I had been in, and in a moment all my anger melted back. As if I had just woken up, I was suddenly aware of the mess of shards and glass that littered the floor. My face was wet and my throat hurt. Throbbing pain shot through my hand. Looking back to the jagged hole in my kitchen wall, there were no insects pouring out as I had imagined. 

Though no one was there to see it, I felt ashamed of the state. 

I curled up, crouched over the mess, and I sobbed. It was like I was floating, every sin I had carried was pulled out of me, and I could feel the weightlessness of that burden. It was nice. But it was also like a part of me had left, and left behind a hole. But for now I just hoped maybe I had been relieved of my judgement. 

I cried hard into my hands. Everything I had been holding back for the past few days, my endless grief over Daniel, my guilt, all of it bubbled up in that moment, and I could not stop crying. It spilled out and out and out; over my face and spilling into my hands. I crouched there, sobbing so hard it began to echo throughout the house. 

From down the hall, I heard each of my own sobs, off-beat and hushed. My crying began to trickle into hitches of breath as I registered it wasn’t me I was hearing. They were in the hall. They were still here. I wasn’t even angry at this point, I just felt so tired. The glass crunched under my heels as I stood, impaling into my dirty sneakers I still hadn’t removed from my walk. The doorway to the living room felt impossible. Everything fell silent. There was a moment, where my breath was held and the air was as tense as I was; then a horrific reflection of my own face appeared from that doorway. 

I registered it was meant to be my face, but everything about it was wrong. Its eyes seemed to be melting from its head. The body jerked around the corner like an amateur’s marionette, struggling to move through its impossible proportions. Despite the sniffling half sobs coming from somewhere inside it, it conveyed no expression and its mouth stayed glued shut. I was frozen as I tried to register what this horrific doppelgänger was. Shambling across the glass, it didn’t even seem to register any sort of pain as it slowly moved closer and closer. 

Finally, my senses caught up to me. I scrambled backwards, skittering over glass until my back hit the edge of the counter. It continued to amble closer, seemingly knowing it would get to me in its own time. I was pinned in the kitchen. I had to move. As it’s gnarled hands reached out towards me I dropped to the floor, clambering across the ground and stumbling out to the lounge, nicks cutting into my hands and knees. Glancing back, it turned, slowly, its uneven eyes struggling to follow me as they rolled around in its head. Scrambling for anything, my head whipped around looking for something, some way to save myself. As soon as it left my sight, it pounced. 

My head cracked against the floor as we thudded into the carpet, rolling around and scrabbling against each other like animals. My nails caught and bent against the strange folds of the creature, where its soft peach rind skin had tried to form clothes. I struggled to shove it off, hands slick with sweat. It wasn’t coordinated, more slapping and wriggling as it struggled to puppet its body, but it was strong, and dense. Grunting, I managed to catch my hips enough to throw it off, and fumble back away from it on my hands until I hit the coffee table.

It seemed to fight against itself for a moment. Its limbs, appearing devoid of muscle, floundered under it as it attempted to push itself from the floor. Its useless eyes stared out at me from the warped version of my face, a blank unreadable expression and it’s empty maw of a mouth gaping open and closed. 

Everything in me was trembling. Sweat and tears dripped into my eyes. The doppelgänger limply rose, its neck twisted and its head drooping over its chest. 

Huff huff. It was mimicking my panicked breaths. 

“Do some- Do something.” My own voice, in a desperate rasp, choked out from it, muffled from within its body. I couldn’t help but sob in horror. I clawed at the floor as I crawled back towards the kitchen, out of the corner I had been backed into. It caught my ankle. Kicking and gasping, I fought against its bruising grip. It did not let go. It tugged at my leg, attempting to drag me to it, but unable to devise using it’s other hand. 

“An okay- an ok-y host. Host. Okay host.” It blabbered on and on. The grip on my ankle was so strong, it felt as if I could feel my bones creaking. The sobs from my chest were uncontrollable now. It was so strong. 

I don’t even know what this is. I can’t do this. I can’t, I can’t, I don’t want to. God, please just let it stop. It was hopeless. 

The creature yanked me back, clambering up my body on its unsteady limbs. I let go of the handfuls of carpet I had been gripping and clutched at my face, smearing tears across my cheeks and into my hair. A jolt of searing pain raced up my leg as small mouths dug into my flesh. Through the blur of tears I could see my own face buried into my leg with blood smeared across the many pairs of strange protruding mandibles, like bugs tearing into an overripe fruit. 

It was painful. The most pain I had ever felt. Now that it had got me, it reveled, tearing out bloody chunks of my leg muscle. I lay pinned, writhing and hiccuping beneath it, the same way I had when I broke my ankle falling from a tree when I was 12. More than anything, more than I wanted the pain to stop, I wished Daniel was there like he was when we were 12. As my vision spotted, I tried to picture him crouched next to me, hoarsely calling for mum and patting my muddy hair. I tried to feel his bony hand clutching my fingers through the overwhelming waves of pain. The tearing sound was drowning out his cries for help. 

Daniel had always been better than me. Where I had been spiteful in my envy, he had always cared for me. He hadn’t let go of my hand the whole way to the hospital. I may be an evil person, but Daniel never was. He would have told me to keep going. He wouldn’t have wanted me to give up and follow him. He would have forgiven me. 

I could almost feel his gentle fingers clutching my hand as I reached back, grasping with shaking hands the bowl of cereal that was still on the living room floor. It shattered as it collided with the creature’s head, splintering apart in my hand. 

It’s head seemed to dissolve, bug sized things skittering in all directions over my mangled leg. I used my numb arms to scramble back, smearing blood over the carpet, and tried to pull my leg from under it. Agonising pain shot through me like fire from a simple movement, but I kept trying, eventually pulling it free as I slid through the pools of blood. The thing was now half formed, struggling to keep whatever was making it up from skittering away as well. It was somehow more grotesque than when I had first seen it, now just a jaw sitting atop the neck, and its skin shifting and crawling. 

My back hit the wall, but I kept shuffling back, trying in vain to phase through and away from that creature, but all I could do was pull my legs in tight, having to manually pull what remained of the bloodied one towards me with my hands. The feeling of my own muscle flexing uselessly under my fingers still aches through my hands from time to time. 

Those bug-like things dispersed faster and faster, and what was once my doppelganger seemed to almost dissolve with it, jerking and twitching. Some of them skittered towards me, trying to get at my open wound, but as I yelped, they would run off; a lot less brave on their own. 

As my nightmare collapsed into nothing, along with it went my strength. My writhing shuffle slowed into shaking. Afraid to close my eyes, I continued to watch lifelessly as the last creatures skittered back away into the walls, and for a long time after I stayed there with my eyes open. After seeing something like that, after spending the last few weeks in a paranoid daze only to be proved right in a way, it’s hard to know what to do next. Alright. Just break it down. 

I don’t remember much of the after. Now that I’m back in that flat I can piece it together. I don’t remember it, but there's a blood trail from where I had huddled up against the wall all the way through to my dresser of my room. The bottom drawer is still open and my clothes are pulled out all over the floor. I must have called for help because I remember flashes of a hospital bed and a paramedic leaning down through the ghostly, bright lights asking my name. I know I didn’t tell them anything because Rebbekah told me she had to describe me to the nurses at reception. She had shown up to my flat to study, only to see the ambulance leaving and several cops milling around dumbfounded at my door. I still wonder who that stain was. Every night I apologise to them but I wish I had a name to pray for at least. 

Rebbekah dropped me off here today. I know she still desperately wants to know what happened that night, but I don’t know if I could explain it to anyone. I guess that’s why I’m writing this down. I just need it to be out there, but it must stay in this house. I just came to get my things. From here, I’m going back to my Mum for a bit. I don’t know from there, but at least I’ll drop by Daniel. Now though, I need to call my mum",1,1771029484.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1r466p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1r466p3/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Weighed myself at the gym the other day and realized I’d gained somewhere in the ballpark or 70 pounds, which to me is unacceptable.

When I was working/schooling 70-80 hours a week for about a year I’d unintentionally switched my diet from regular fasting to OMAD. After some mental health issues, recovery, and other life events I wasn’t fasting whatsoever. Now, though, my body image issues (and, maybe more importantly to some people, physical health) are getting bad again so I’m switching to OMAD intentionally for the foreseeable future.

Currently clocking in \~270lbs of ew after a period where I was very, VERY happy at 200lbs (I prefer being a big boy but not a giant boy). Hoping to get back down to 230 by summer (as healthily as possible), and probs gonna be very disappointed with myself if I’m not at 200 by next year.

Today’s been my first day, I’m on \~hour 25 of fasting save for some iced coffee, iced tea, crapload of water, and a couple zero sugar Monsters (terrible for you, autophagy, and your insulin, I know. I’m not surviving without my overdose of caffeine though). It’s only been this long cause my last meal was at a weird time yesterday with my work/sleep schedule and what I was up to.

Planning to eat so, so many eggs for dinner. And obviously a bunch of veggies, and probs a bowl of Greek yogurt. Plus some nuts. Not in the mood for meat or I would’ve thawed some chicken—ooh actually that reminds me I have shrimp. I might have some of that.

I do work a pretty active job where I’m on my feet for 5-10 hours a day, lifting stuff, and basically always moving or running around. I’m also surrounded by food lol. Going to the gym as much as possible rn, with my weight gain I’m forcing myself back into the 1 hour a day 6 days a week grind though. 

Yeah I know I could be calorie counting, but I hate doing that. Doing dramatic shifts like this makes my brain much happier, and keeps me going longer than monotonous routines that I have to do every few hours. Plus if I have too much freedom I will down a family sized bag of tortillas and two whole things of salsa. It’s BAD BAD.

Anyways, gonna go nap. I have a 12 hour shift tomorrow and then a hangout with some friends, will keep y’all updated",1,1771029329.0,omad,0,0.99,False

I’ll be spending a day in Paris soon and I’m looking for recommendations on nice areas to just wander around.

I’m not really interested in monuments or tourist attractions this time. I’ve already visited the main sights a few years ago. This trip will be short, so I’d just like to walk a bit, explore pretty streets, maybe sit at a terrace, have a coffee, and enjoy the atmosphere.

I was thinking about checking out Le Marais, but I’d love suggestions for specific neighborhoods, streets, or spots that are pleasant for a relaxed stroll.

Thanks a lot! 😊",3,1771028975.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,1.0,False

1r4616k,https://i.redd.it/dp76izhmscjg1.jpeg,[Roast Review] Frequent Coffee - Sidekick Decaf (Espresso),"Roaster: Frequent Coffee

Bean Name: Sidekick Decaf

Roast Level: Medium

Single Origin / Blend: Single Origin

Origin (Country / Region): Colombia, Huila

Roast Date: 2/8/2026

Process (if known): Sugarcane (EA)

Brew Method(s): Espresso

  
I was pretty stoked to try out an offering from Frequent Coffee after learning a bunch about their sourcing and their true dedication to the decaf world.  My hope was to get my hands on the Finca El Paraiso, but unfortunately it was out of stock due to high demand.  I went with the Sidekick which is supposed to be a classic from Frequent.  

  
If one thing is for sure, it's that they are not lying when they mention cherry in the tasting notes.  Aroma: straight cherry.  Ground coffee smell: Cherry Bomb.  Espresso taste: smooth cherry punch to the face.  I was pleasantly surprised by the dominance of cherry on this roast, although I was able to get a nice mix of the chocolates and sugary tones as well.  I found this one worked best with a classic 1:2 ratio pulled in around 28-30 seconds for espresso.  This is certainly a keeper, I could see this being a go-to if I want a smooth decaf with some incredible aromas.

  
Also, shout out to Mark at Frequent Coffee for including some single dose bags of the Finca El Paraiso and Watermelon Co-Ferment with my order.  I pulled both of these on the Oxo Rapid Brewer and was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the El Paraiso.  It was so crazy complex in the best of ways, I am salivating just thinking of it.  The Watermelon Co-Ferment was also very nice with a bright acidity.  I do know that the Co-Ferment just hit the shelves as of a day or two ago.  I honestly can't wait to see how Mark continues to push the boundaries of decaf coffee.",1,1771028919.0,SanDiegoCoffeeBeans,0,1.0,False

Tara na today I’m willing to free my day just to be with you. You don’t know how happy I was when you replied to my story. Effective yung pagpaparinig ko haha. Iniisip ko pa yung right words to use kasi baka ma-off ka if I’ll sound super excited. G ako kahit sa QC, kahit saan, hindi ako malalayuan kung ikaw namn yung pupuntahan.

Tinamaan na talaga ako, gustong-gusto na kita. Walang day sa work na hinihiling kong makita kita kahit saglit lang. I was surprised nung pumunta ka din sa work sa labas. I thought it will be a simple “hi” or “hello” but you offered to hug me, in front of so many people. So another hope na baka ma pupuntahan naman talaga to. 

I never felt this kind of interest for the longest time. You are the first guy to asked me “let’s have a coffee sometime,” and “ang cute mo talaga.” Di ko alam kung anong sasabihin ko or magiging reaction ko kapag ginagawa mo sakin yan. Nasasanay na nga ako eh, hinahanap-hanap ko na, kasi gusto nakita.

Iniisip ko nalang ngayon baka busy ka lang talaga. Well kahit ako naman, but I guess a person will make time and will find time for the right person. I want to know you, I want to love you, and I want to take this risk because it’s you.

She seemed really cool and actually started the conversation. We talked for a long time, and I felt some chemistry. I had to leave for a meeting, but later I went back and we ended up talking even longer. She asked if I had Instagram, I said yes, handed her my phone, and she sent herself a request. She mentioned she’s private with her Instagram and only lets a few people follow her.

At the end of my shift I wanted to say goodbye, but she had to deal with a patient. Later that night around 9, she messaged me saying it was nice talking to me and apologized for leaving so abruptly. After some back-and-forth, I worked up the courage to ask her out for food or coffee since I felt like she was giving me signs. She said yes, but apologized in advance about how busy her schedule is and how random she can be with responding.

After a week or two, we finally went on a date and it went really well. We spent about four hours just talking and playing chess. Before we left, she apologized again, saying she’s not great at responding because she’s busy and rarely on her phone in general. She also said she’d want to pick a day based on my schedule. Overall, the date was great and I felt even stronger chemistry.

My only issue is that she can be really dry over text, and the response times don’t help, especially when trying to plan things. Most of the time I can tell when someone isn’t interested, but with her it’s mixed, because in person, the chemistry is clearly there, but over text it feels dull.

Now that there’s some context, I was wondering if it would be appropriate to wish her a happy Valentine’s Day. I don’t want to overstep or make her uncomfortable.",1,1771028798.0,Advice,6,0.67,False

Now I’m marrying the girl I met in a psych ward.



Five years ago I was in a really bad place. I didn’t think I had a future. After one of my attempts, I got admitted to a psych ward.



I mostly kept to myself. Didn’t feel like talking. Didn’t feel like explaining anything to anyone.



She was there too.



We ended up in the same group a few times. At some point we started talking — not about anything deep, just random stuff to pass the time. Complaining, making dumb jokes, that kind of thing. It was easier to talk to someone who already understood why we were there.



Later we did talk about real things. Not in some dramatic, life-changing way. Just honest. How tired we were. How hard it is to tell people you’re not okay. Stuff like that.



When we got out, we stayed in touch. Met up for coffee a couple weeks later. Then again. It just… kept going.



It wasn’t some movie moment where everything suddenly got better. We both still had a lot to deal with. Therapy, meds, bad days. But we stuck around for each other.



Now it’s been five years and we’re planning our wedding.



I used to think my life was basically over back then. Turns out it wasn’t.



If you’re in that place where you can’t see anything ahead of you, I get it. I really do. I couldn’t either.



Anyway. I’m still here.



And I’m glad I am.",44,1771028425.0,AmazingStories,3,1.0,False

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too.

1r45ohm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r45ohm/today_i_met_up_with_my_ex_3_months_after_breaking/,Today I met up with my ex 3 months after breaking up,"For some context, my ex (25M) broke up with me (26F) last november after being together for over a year, the relationship started as long distance since we're from the same country but he's doing his master's degree in the other side of the world, I got the possibility to live with him for 3 months in the country he's studying and in the summer he came back to our country and we presented each other to our families and friends so when he left in september I felt really safe in our relationship. The break up came across to me as a blindside as for the last 3 weeks I felt him distancing and engaging less in conversations so I asked him two times if everything was okay and he said yes. After these 3 weeks in which I told myself I was insecure because it was just in my mind I woke up with a message saying he needed to call me and tell me something as he hadn't been honest and that's when he announced he lost his feelings and wanted to break up. I felt shocked and after the call I spent 2 weeks crying my eyes out, going to therapy, relaying on my friends and family, making sense of everything and organizing my ideas as I needed another call to better understand everything. The call lasted 7 hours and he got to explain himseld better and I got to opportunity to tell him how my gut was right and I felt decieve of how he took a decision for me. I asked him to go no contact until he came to our country in Febraury to meet up and heal my wound meanwhile.

Febraury arrived and these past months this sub has been a great support for me, I have made this account just to publish this. I've been focusing on therapy, my friends, family, my studies and my physical wellbeing to try and heal as much as possible to prepare for the meet up. We talked through message last week to arrange the meeting and talk about the things he had to give me back, in that conversation he told me he was looking forward to see me and talk things. That message hurt me and I told him I appreciated his honesty but reading that hurt me.

Today, we met up in the morning to have a coffee, I felt surprisingly calm and we got to update each other about our lives, we felt really comfortable with each other and I told him I felt time hadn't past but I felt a great distance between us. We got to talk about the relationship and he aknowledged he didn't do the things right but it was the best he knew. I told him I knew he didn't have bad intentions but I felt hurt because he took the decision alone and I didn't get to participate in any of the process, what arrived to me was the delivery once he was sure about it and had started grieving inside the relationship. He said he couldn't change the past but had learnt from it. We kept talking about other things that had hurt me and he reassured me in everything, I felt listened and cared for.

Then, I told him I felt conflicted because a part of me felt the break up was the right thing and I was happy with how my life looked like without him in it but at the same time seeing him again confirmed that my desire for him was still present and with that, the thought of would it work now that we had time and distance to learn from our mistakes as I got to see the relationship wasn't as solid and strong as I thought. He said that when he saw me he felt his reason was stronger than his desire and he confirmed his decision was final and didn't want to try again, he also said he thinks he will stay in the country he's studying in the long future which also made me realize that even if we tried again, we would still have parallel lives.

We talked about the what now and he said he was open to keep a friendship but I expressed, once again, my contradictions. A side of me feels frustration as being his friend is honestly not the role I want to play in his life, I want to go back to the  girlfriend role. Another side of me, feels that anything is better than nothing as I consider him a very special person and I don't want to cut ties with him. And the last side of me feels that my life is better without him even if it hurts to let go. We decided to keep the door open as it's too early to take any decision but he said he would respect and understand any outcome. He's staying in our country for a month so we are thinking about grabbing coffee another day and see how it goes as we were feeling really comfortable with each other. 

We had dinner and went for a walk and in total we spent almost 7 hours together. I feel satisfied with how calm I was able to be, only two tears fell from my eyes and I felt a huge relief from finally telling him everything I still got inside, I felt that he genuinely cares for me and appreciates me but I feel like the meet up was an oasis in the desert. It felt really good but once I left I started crying and feeling this huge void inside my chest, my hope for getting back together has been torn down and it hurts but feels liberating at the same time. It hurts a lot right now but I'm sure with time, I will look back and know that it had to happen as the break up allowed me to focus on building my selflove and to better understand that love is not forever and sometimes, people just come into your life to teach you something and leave. It hurts but I'm happy that the good of the relationship has happened and the bad of the break up has happend too as it has made me stronger and wiser.

I'll finish this saying that I still have a long way to go in my healing journey but the meet up today has been very useful for me as to continueg being honest with myself and with my ex. I don't know what shape will take our bound but I know I will feel grateful with whatever it will be.

Interested in the variations of what a flat white is globally, particularly now that it's become a pretty household term all around the world.

Would love to know:

\- where you are

\- what size cup it comes in (or sizes if there are multiple)

\- how much espresso

\- how much foam

\- what kind of establishment (chain/specialty/whatever)

And also, if you're worked in multiple places, if this has changed place to place, or even just over time.

I’m 34, originally from Korea, and I’ve been living in the U.S. since I was 14. Currently based in Fort Lee, NJ.

I’m 5'8"" (173 cm), about 143 lbs, and I try to stay active and balanced in life. I’m into technology — computers, phones, electronics — I just enjoy understanding how things work. I also love gaming, movies, anime, photography, peaceful walks in the park, and of course, coffee. I used to work as a barista at a small café, and I still enjoy making coffee at home. Whiskey and pizza are definitely favorites too.

Personality-wise, I’m calm and thoughtful. I tend to think deeply about things. I’m naturally a bit introverted, but once I feel comfortable, I can be surprisingly outgoing and talkative. I value meaningful conversations and emotional connection.

When it comes to dating, I prefer to take things slow and really get to know each other. I appreciate frequent communication — staying connected throughout the day matters to me. I believe a strong relationship is built on consistency, mutual respect, and understanding.

I’m attracted to someone who carries herself with kindness, wisdom, and warmth. Physical attraction matters too — I tend to be drawn to someone slim, petite, or of average build.

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone genuine who’s ready to build something meaningful together. Maybe we start with coffee and a walk, and see where it goes.

My name is Mason, I'm an undergrad studying biomedical engineering, with hopes to become a doctor specializing in amputee care.

My area of research is proprioception and phantom limb pain. My own proprioception is very shoddy because of a connective tissue disorder (Ehlers danlos!) so I have first hand experience with that, but I don't have understanding of what its like to live with partial loss of proprioception from the loss of a limb, or live with phantom limb pain.

Before I start coming up with solutions and things to build, I'd really like to better understand what it's like, and do some listening.

If anyone would be willing to share a bit about their day to day experiences (like how it feels to move through your morning routine, your commute, your job, cooking, having a cup of coffee or tea, zipping up a jacket, etc, or what phantom limb pain/ itchiness/stiffness feels like on your end, I would be extremely grateful.

Maybe 2-3 are now going to pay but the rest of the non-paying parents still aren't gonna pay. Keeping GC allows families and coaches to pull clips from the video. For those now paying, it's worth it for them to now get boxscores and play by play. After all, the plus subscription is less than $4 a month. Hard to complain when we pay so much more for travel or coffee.

Looked at the competition and no one's remotely close enough for us to consider. As a compromise for the non-paying parents, we're going to now start a YT channel and upload our games there the day after. Won't be live but at least there's a way for them to watch if they couldn't be there. They'll know the result before watching but oh well, thems the breaks. If we can find another volunteer, maybe they can stream to YT live but that won't be  priority.

But since we're gonna be setting things up properly, why not go all out? Might as well take the time to get everyone actually connected to the players they're watching! And if we gonna do that, I guess we can make the feed private so only our families have access. We only had it public before so tech challenged grandparents could watch but most of them are now going to be linked to their athletes or watch the next day so no reason at all to leave it public anymore.

Morwen tossed the fighting staff to Andy. It was early morning, and mist rose from the mountainside in the near distance.

The staff was hefty. The dark wood was polished and sealed, but otherwise, it was just a plain staff, about five feet in length and two inches in diameter.

“This is both the simplest and most important weapon to master,” Morwen said as she stood beside Andy and held her staff with both hands. “Copy my movements,” she said.

Andy held his staff out in front of him, his hands gripping it about a shoulder length apart.

Morwen shifted her grip so that one her right hand faced upward and her left hand downward on the horizontal staff.

Andy did the same.

“Now, bring your staff to a vertical position,” she said, rotating counterclockwise until it pointed to the sky, right hand resting above the left.

Andy did the same.

“Now, find the halfway point between horizontal and vertical positions, a forty-five degree angle,” she said, holding her staff diagonally across her torso.

Andy copied her.

“There are two basic attacks from this position,” said Morwen. “You can strike from the top.” She brought her staff downward, pushing her right hand forward and pulling her left hand back. “Or you can strike from below,” she pulled the top of the staff over her right shoulder as she pushed left arm out, bringing the staff upward in a swift motion.

Andy copied both. He imagined an enemy in front of him, bringing his staff down on their shoulder, then up against their rib cage.

They drilled the basic attacks for a few rounds before moving to other variations, attacking from a horizontal position, swinging the staff like a bat to achieve extra range, and using the center of the staff to deliver a powerful blow to the enemy.

“Great,” Morwen said, “You’ve got the basics down. Let’s go over forms and drills, that’s what you will be tested on in a couple of days.”

“What is a form?” Andy asked. “He thought he had heard of it in martial arts before, but he was never a karate guy.

“It’s a sequence of movements designed to demonstrate your understanding of proper technique. The key, with the forms, is simultaneous precision and ease.”

Andy nodded.

She led him through a series of movements. Horizontal position, strike to the right followed by a jab forward, strike to the left followed by a jab forward. Diagonal position, strike from above, strike from below, jab forward. Two swings of the staff while gripping it on the end like a bat. Shove, shove, roll forward and rise into a strike from above.

Andy mimicked her as best he could, following each movement carefully. The horizontal and diagonal positions came fairly naturally to him, as did the shoving. He had more trouble with the wide swings, and he had the *most* trouble rolling forward.

He had to enter the forward roll without use of his hands to stabilize himself, since they were holding his staff. He had to be accurate, tucking his chin and making ground contact with his shoulder in the right way. He tried a few times, knocking the wind out of himself and falling onto his back both times.

Each time, Andy rose up, slightly more frustrated than the last.

“Take your time,” Morwen said.

“I don’t understand why I’m not getting it,” said Andy, breathing heavily.

“I admit,” Morwen said, “this staff form is a bit more geared toward dancers. With a level in **\[acrobatics\]** it would have been easy. But you’re a brawner, so you’re going to have to work a bit more diligently at this.”

“Is there a version of the form without the roll?” Andy asked.

Morwen chuckled. “No,” she said. “Part of mastering the basics of the staff is the ability to maneuver on the ground with it. It’s maneuvers like these that separate people with the **\[martial weapons\]** skill from novices.”

She was right. Andy wanted to skip over the difficult bits, but it was precisely the difficulty of the form that made it worth learning.

Andy tried again, and again, and again. He landed on his neck, on his back, and finally, on his side.

“Something about the staff is just tripping me up,” he said. “I just can’t roll forward without my hands.”

“How about this,” Morwen said. “Why don't you give it a shot without the staff. Get good at rolling without your hands first, then add the staff back in. When you have an issue like this, it’s wise to break it into its component pieces and then put those pieces back together.”

Andy nodded in agreement, leaning his staff on the trunk of a tree.

Without the staff to worry about, the task seemed simpler.

*Fall forward on your shoulder into a roll, and rise back to your feet.*

Andy pushed forward, tucking his chin as he dropped his shoulder to the ground. He kept his hand at his side as he ducked into a perfect roll, rising to his feet.

“See, not so bad, right?” Morwen said.

“I guess not,” said Andy. He drilled the roll a few more times before retrieving his staff.

“Now, just do the same thing. The staff will remain horizontal at your waist, you just roll over it. You can forget it’s there.”

Andy nodded. He kept his hands at his side, but this time, each hand held onto the fighting staff. Then, he did what he had just done repeatedly: he fell headfirst into the ground, tucking his chin and making contact on his shoulder, rolling forward and rising to his feet. He finished with an overhead attack.

“Perfect!” Morwen said. “Well done!”

Andy smiled. It seemed almost insignificant compared to some of his other recent achievements, but mastering a roll that he found difficult without any prior **\[acrobatics\]** training was still something to be proud of. He had accomplished it in a matter of minutes through simple persistence and repetition.

He consolidated his forms, practicing the entire sequence a few times under Morwen’s supervision. She corrected his posture and positioning here and there, but after another hour or so, he was able to execute the whole thing almost flawlessly.

“Let’s go through the drills now, and we might be able to finish before lunch.”

The drills were fairly straightforward. Morwen stood opposite him, using her own staff to launch attacks from above and below on both sides, as well as jabs. In each case, Andy used his staff defensively to deflect her blows.

“Very good,” said Morwen. “Now you take the offensive, copy the same sequence of attacks I delivered.”

Andy did the same, launching a series of attacks and jabs on either side, and Morwen deflected them with her staff.

The whole process went smoothly.

“You’re a natural,” Morwen said, wiping the sweat off her brow. The mid-morning sunlight had just begun to paint the mountain a brilliant gold, burning off the mist. “And we’re done by lunch, just like I thought.”

\*\*\*

Andy stoked the fire under the stew bubbling in the den, as he had done four times a day since beginning his training. Morwen and he both had a bowl.

“I’ve got an **Enchanter** visiting tomorrow,” Morwen said. “He’s going to add some enhancements to the room upstairs. Once he’s done, we can discuss your questions about the Order of the behemoth, about the nobility, Cresthaven politics, whatever you want.”

“Great,” Andy said. But he was curious. “What sort of enhancement?”

“Did Pliny take you to the alcove at the top of the training cliffs?” Morwen asked.

Andy nodded affirmatively.

“And did he point out the sigil on the ceiling?”

Andy nodded again.

“That kind of enhancement.”

“Interesting,” said Andy. “You think the ratfolk can hear all the way in here?”

“Oh, it’s not the ratfolk I’m worried about,” said Morwen. “They’re here to send a message, and sure, they collect information and report back to the nobles, but they’re small fries.”

“How do you mean?” Andy said. “I’ve seen them hanging around quite often, sometimes more than one, peering in on everything we do in the yard.”

“Exactly,” said Morwen, “you’ve *seen* them. The spies I’m *really* worried about probably don’t keep tabs on us twenty-four hours per day. Their time is too valuable. But you would never know it if they were watching you.”

“Huh,” Andy said.

“This soup is excellent by the way,” Morwen said. “Did you do something to it?”

“Salt,” said Andy.

Morwen raised her eyebrows, taking another bite and chewing heartily.

As they continued eating their bowls of stew, footsteps resounded up the spiral staircase. Noel appeared.

“Noel, you’re awake!” said Morwen. “After a long and undisturbed rest, I hope.”

Noel yawned, stretched and smiled. “Got any coffee?”

“I’ll be happy to get you some,” Andy said, rising to his feet and retrieving the coffee pot. He scooped some grounds into it and placed it on the small grate in the fireplace.

Noel plopped down on an armchair, yawning again.

“They really got their money’s worth out of you, didn’t they?” Morwen said.

“They sure did,” Noel said. “Speaking of… did the delivery arrive this morning?”

“No,” Morwen said. “I didn’t see anything.”

“Hmmm,” said Noel. “Well, they said this evening, so it’s probably got a little while left to go before it gets here. Who knows what kind of wagons they had to hire to deliver all the shares to the right folks.”

“Wagons, huh?” Morwen asked. “It’s that much?”

“Indeed,” said Noel. “I was surprised myself at the size of the horde.”

As the coffee reached a boil, Andy poured a mug and handed it to Noel.

“Thank you, dear boy,” Noel said, sipping on the cup. “Ah… I never sleep in like this anymore, rising after lunch. It’s kind of nice, even though I wouldn’t want to do it every day.”

“What are you going to do with your treasure when it arrives?” Andy asked.

“Oh… you know, I hadn’t thought of it,” Noel said. “I suppose I could probably purchase a cottage for my mother to stay in. Her home is in need of so much repair… I’d like her to live her later years somewhere really nice…”

“That’s mighty noble of you,” Morwen said. “Not going to spend it on yourself?”

“I don’t think I need anything,” said Noel. “I’ve got friends… I fill my days with exciting adventures. I have clothes. I suppose I could buy a horse, but then I’d have to feed it and take care of it… No, I think I am just fine the way I am.” He stared up at the ceiling reflectively, holding his hands gently around his mug. “Should be here tonight, though,” he said.

Andy wondered how often Noel did private jobs, and how much they typically paid. Back at the Dawnspring Cottage, Lilly had mentioned that the **Fighter** class could be lucrative, but Noel had mentioned that his mother was not living in the best of conditions, so clearly he wasn’t rich. But there could be many reasons for his humble means.

Noel struck Andy as someone who valued simplicity over almost anything else. He didn’t want to be tied down with obligations and things he had to maintain. He also seemed both absent-minded and not particularly money-savvy. Perhaps he had taken up the life of a **Fighter** for sheer love of it. Andy wondered these things, but didn’t bother his weary comrade with his questions.

Hopefully, Noel would get his payout soon enough.

The rest of the day was quiet. Andy practiced a bit more with his staff after lunch, and he took another long, hot bath before getting a nap.

He awoke in the afternoon, expecting to see the treasure he had heard so much about, but it hadn’t come.

He spent some more time seasoning the stew, chopping more wood, and stretching a bit. Dinner came. Pliny was away, so there was no grillmaster in residence. They all ate more stew.

Still, Noel’s treasure didn’t arrive.

\*\*\*

Neroth ducked through the marble arch into the office of the Supreme Minister, two Domestic Guards stepping to the side to allow his entrance. Despite the opulent, high ceilings of the Ministry Palace, the doorway into the Supreme Minister’s office was always just a bit too low for him when he was dressed in his full gear.

He was getting old, nearly seventy, but thanks to the magic of the court **Warlocks**, Neroth had access to treatments that increased his longevity. Despite the balding crown of his head, he was as strong as ever. And he needed that strength as Captain of the Domestic Guard. Every day, a new battle… ridding Cresthaven of criminals and enemies within.

In contrast to Neroth, Supreme Minister Caines Crotias, who was pushing 120 years of age, was fading. If he were a **Lich**, the Supreme Minister could live indefinitely, but short of that, no amount of wizardry could grant a mortal eternal life.

But in Neroth’s experience with the Minister, everlasting life didn’t fit Crotias’ personality. For a Supreme Minister, he was surprisingly down to earth. His mental faculties and physical capacities, while still passable, weren’t what they were even a couple of years ago, and he knew that. He had been convening with his inner circle on his plans to pass the throne to Sethor, his son. His long rule was coming to a close, and he wanted to live the remainder of his years in peace.

“You called for me?” Neroth said, standing tall in his black reflective armor. He stood just inside the office door across from Caines, who sat behind a desk, and Sethor, who stared out an elaborate window looking down over Cresthaven with his back turned to Neroth and Caines.

“Yes, yes,” Caines Crotias said, shuffling through some papers before looking up at him, smiling warmly. Despite the deep wrinkles, his countenance was bright and kind. “Do you have results on the report I requested? Some of my court **Warlocks** are anxious for an update later this afternoon and I wanted to throw them a bone.”

After receiving the results of a **{divination}** from a **Warlock** in his court, the Supreme Minister had called on Neroth to deliver a special report on the sudden appearance of the Visitor. Neroth contracted with a ratfolk spy network for basic intelligence gathering, and, of course, to let the Visitor know he was being watched.

Neroth nodded. “Of course, your excellency. Our intelligence indicates that the new Visitor has taken up residence at Morwen’s Grove,” he said, bowing his head in deference to Crotias.

“Ah,” Crotias said, looking up at the ceiling in thought. “That’s associated with the Behemoth, no? Is this Visitor showing interest in the Order, then?”

“It appears so,” said Neroth. “He’s been training in **\[athletics\]** and **\[combat\]**, and, if I may say, he is making very rapid progress.”

“As is usual with Visitors. Hmmm. Well, the Order, you know, is a pain in my backside at times, and goodness knows many **Wizards** and **Warlocks** in my court hate them, but if you govern fairly they usually leave you alone. Perhaps it's not such a bad thing.”

Sethor turned around, scowling. He was about forty years old, but with neither hard labor nor battle experience, he looked quite a bit younger. “You cannot be serious,” he said, glaring at his father.

“I am, indeed.”

“If the Order of the Behemoth gains strength, then they will threaten our power once again.”

Caines leaned back in his chair and stroke his chin, looking at Sethor. “My son, your political thought is… indelicate.”

Neroth stood still. He could tell an argument might break out at any moment, and he wanted no part of it. Sethor was liable to lash out, and even though Neroth was among the most senior officials, that didn’t necessarily protect him. Only last year, there was a rumor that one of the senators in the House of Law had been defenestrated from Sethor’s office following a quarrel.

“Listen, old man,” Sethor said. “You live in the past. The people of Cresthaven are *tired* of footing the bill for the opulent services afforded to every beggar on our coast.”

Sethor was right, there had been increasing grumblings from the people – well, the land-owning gentry, at least – that they were paying too much in taxes and that the education, medicine, and food services offered by the Supreme Ministry were wasteful. A growing number of influential people wanted to crack down on, as they called it, wasteful spending.

“You don’t understand, Sethor,” Caines said. “It is simply a matter of good policy. As long as the lower class can lead dignified lives, we will have no issue with the Order, and there will be no cause for revolution. As you can see, under my rule, the Order has become the weakest it has ever been since its inception. That’s because we’ve largely eliminated the root cause for revolution.”

“With our Domestic Guard, we could *crush* any revolutionaries who dared–”

“My dear boy,” Caines interrupted, becoming terse. “When you take the throne, the power will be yours. But I hope, for your sake and for the sake of the kingdom, that you surround yourself with advisers who possess more political prowess than you are exhibiting right now.”

Neroth diverted his eyes to the floor as Neroth’s face turned beet red.

“In any case,” Sethor said through gritted teeth, “I would encourage you to dissuade this Visitor from affiliation with the Order. Either that or have him eliminated.”

Caines exhaled, his face dropping in weariness. “My child… sometimes it is better to starve a movement of attention. Prohibition and violence serve only to increase fascination.”

Sethor grunted and turned back around, contemplating the city below.

“Will that be all?” Neroth asked.

“Yes, I believe so,” Caines said with a cordial smile and a nod.

Neroth bowed and turned to leave, the guards parting once again for his exit.

“Ah, one more thing,” Caines said.

“Yes, my lord?” Neroth said, pausing at the door.

“I’ve decided to hold an arena event for your upcoming birthday.”

“Why… that is very kind, your excellency.” Neroth bowed. Caines had always been a kind ruler and leader, but Neroth hadn’t expected this gift. “Thank you.”

“It’ll give the people some diversion, and if you’d like, you can schedule a few classical combat matches. Those are always hits with the nobility. You’ve been a good Captain of the Guard and, well, I’m running out of time to put on shows for my people.”

“I could think of no better way to celebrate my seventieth year,” Neroth said, his chest swelling up with pride.

“Very good,” said Caines, nodding toward Neroth with a smile.

Neroth bowed and exited. An arena event dedicated to him, held in his honor? That was something he had dreamed about since he was a young lad.

He had made it. He was a great man.

But as Neroth made his way back to the headquarters of the Domestic Guard, his mind quickly wandered back to the trouble on the horizon: Caines Crotias was unconcerned with a Visitor joining the Order of the Behemoth, and under Caines’ rule, he might not have a problem.

He had enjoyed a relatively quiet last decade of domestic security, largely thanks to Caines Crotias’ decisions. As unpopular as he was with the gentry, Neroth had to admit… The policies of Caines Crotias had led to an unprecedented age of stability. But with Sethor’s rule on the horizon, a robust Order of the Behemoth could make Neroth’s life difficult.

He’d have to deal with the Visitor somehow.

We've been friends for over 10 years. I've lived across the country for the last 6. 

Context - I have a blazer with beaded tassels that she loves. Not that it matters but it is \~$300. She has asked me for it several times over the past 2 years. Like, ""Don't you want to just give it to me already? Its more my style and you never wear it."" To which I always laugh it off and say I love that blazer. 

When she was visiting - she asked again if she could 'just have it' and I laughed and said no I don't want to give it away but you're welcome to wear it to dinner!

Her flight was early Thursday morning. We hugged goodbye but I was asleep and only heard her make coffee and get ready before leaving. 

Two days later, I'm getting dressed and just have this feeling - I look for the blazer in my closet. It is not where it normally is, I look everywhere, including my dirty laundry - bc surely she didn't take it. 

I texted her asking if she knew where it was - maybe she wore it to dinner and left it in my car and i forgot. - No. 

She took it. She said she was ""cold and running late for her uber"" and that it was ""the only thing she was sure would fit her"". 

We have been sharing clothes for over a decade. Everything I own fits her and she knows it. Beyond that - this blazer was in the back of my closet. She had to go past 10 oversized sweaters and hoodies to get it. And my oversized hoodie that she had worn the night before was on the couch next to the door. 

I've always been very generous with my stuff. In fact I gave her a few things from Reformation this trip bc I don't wear them and she liked them. I truly feel like since I said no to this - she decided to just take it bc she wanted it. 

So I responded with 'wtf??' she made the same excuses again and then just said she'd mail it back next week. 

I called bullshit for all the reasons I stated above and told her that's weirdo behavior and I'm pissed. I told her to mail it back and that I need space. 

Am I the asshole for being mad about this? Is it crazy to like not even want to be close friends anymore whether she mails the blazer back or not?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

About 8 months ago I made a post about a weather tool I made. The responses from those who have used it along with my other tools has been sooo amazing! I'm so pleased with the current state of the tools now and it wouldn't have been possible without all of the great feedback and ideas from everyone, especially the folks in the ""modding and hacking"" Discord channel!

Since then, I've developed a small suite of apps that I personally use for my day-to-day life. [Passes](https://github.com/vandamd/passes) lets me store my gym membership and movie ticket QR codes. Timetables, a private app (for now), helps me plan my bus and train journeys using [bustimes.org](http://bustimes.org) and various national rail APIs! [Morse](https://x.com/vandamdinh/status/2019527501517594703), another private app, lets me use Beeper to text my friends in WhatsApp groupchats and iMessage family! I'm very proud of [Luma](https://github.com/vandamd/Luma) too!!! :)

On May 20th 2025, I challenged myself to develop a Spotify client using the design language from LightOS. And after 269 days, I'm finally happy to release it! It's completely free, open-source and I'll continue to maintain it the best I can! You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/vandamd/echo).

Spotify recently made changes to their API, so if there are any issues with the app, please let me know. I can't generate a key with the new set of permissions.

I develop all of these apps in my free time whilst balancing my studies at university. If you find any of these useful, please consider [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/vandamd) or [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/vandam)!

1r45amk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r45amk/22f_struggling_early_in_relationship_after_25m/,22F struggling early in relationship after 25M boyfriend’s injury am I selfish for finding this hard?,"Hi everyone. I need some outside perspective because I feel guilty even feeling this way. I (22F) started talking to my boyfriend (25M) in mid-November 2025. We went on our first date a few days later, kept things casual (walks, coffee, simple dates), and he asked me to be his girlfriend on New Year’s Day. So we’ve officially been together just over a month still very early and very much in the foundation stage.

Before Christmas, he had to take two weeks unpaid and went to see family, so he told me money would be tight until around February. I completely understood that. All of our dates from the beginning have been very simple mainly walks and coffee. We’ve never really gone on a proper date apart from our first or done anything more intentional or romantic.

I did recently bring this up because I was starting to feel like there was a slight lack of effort. He was receptive, agreed he could step it up, and said he wanted to improve. The plan was that once he was back at work properly in February, we’d do something more meaningful. We had planned to celebrate Valentine’s early (Feb 6th) and go on a proper date, and we’d also talked about booking a summer holiday around June planning to book it in end of Feb - March.

Then mid-January, he injured his back. It’s quite serious and has restricted his mobility a lot. He hasn’t been able to work since and he doesn’t get sick pay, so financially it’s really affected him. His priorities right now are rent, recovery, and trying to get his back sorted. On top of that, there’s no end date. We genuinely don’t know when he’ll be better. With the NHS, everything is moving very slowly, so it’s looking like it could be a long road.

So now it feels like the relationship never really had the chance to move forward before everything paused. And while he did say he’d put more effort in, it’s hard to imagine what that looks like right now when he’s physically and financially limited. I want to be clear: I understand why I’m not at the top of his priority list right now. I don’t expect to be. He’s dealing with pain, stress, money worries, and uncertainty about his health. Of course that comes first.

But I’m finding it hard. It’s early in the relationship, and we haven’t had the chance to build much of a foundation yet. It feels different than if this happened a year in, when we’d already built something solid to fall back on. Right now, we’re still building  and everything feels paused. It’s hard not being able to go out or do things together, especially when there’s no timeline for when that will change. It’s hard not knowing when he’ll feel physically okay again.

I also have some past relationship trauma that makes this harder. In my previous relationship, I was very “ride or die” when my ex was struggling. When he got back on his feet, we broke up and he suddenly gave another girl everything I had asked for during the hard times. That’s left me with fears that if I stick through the difficult period again, I’ll just be there for the struggle and not the reward. I know that’s not necessarily fair to project, but it’s hard to completely switch those feelings off.

On top of that, I’ve been dealing with recurring yeast infections for the past month, which has reduced my sex drive and means we can’t have intercourse the way we’d normally want to. So there’s also less physical intimacy right now, which adds another layer of frustration and distance. I feel selfish even writing this because I know he’s the one physically injured. But I also don’t want to pretend I’m completely fine and suppress how I feel like I’ve done in the past.

Be brutally honest am I being selfish for feeling this way? Has anyone dealt with something like this early in a relationship? How do you support your partner while still being honest about your own needs, especially when there’s no clear end date? I want to handle this properly, but I’m struggling and would really appreciate straightforward advice.

TL;DR: Very new relationship. Boyfriend injured his back with no end date and can’t work. We never really built momentum before this happened, and now everything feels paused. I feel guilty for struggling am I being selfish?",2,1771027021.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

When people say that ""you lost the battle before it even started"", I feel like this feeling makes me lose that battle. The battle being just living a normal life with routine and showers and trying to do stand-up.

Context: 4th year living with my Mom after a seizure and brain surgery, it's a house of 6, both parents, grandma, cousin and little brother. Outside of parents planning to divorce after the kids leave the house/turn 18, everyone is good and there is good income so everyone has what they need and then some. I'm 27. I lived alone before the surgery and then lived with my Mom afterward because I couldn't get a job. I was diagnosed 3 years ago, and I think I found the right medication (lamotrigine for bipolar, Briviact for the seizures). No seizures for 2 years, had about 9 with some concussions and twice in a car which involved a car crash (I'm okay), and the bipolar swings are less intense. I don't do drugs outside of coffee and nicotine vapes, alcohol would make sleep weird and weed became an escape was making my brain stupid and I'd been smoking weed for about a decade. Today is day 54 sober from weed.

I NEED stand-up, I'm not qualified for jobs, no degree, and interviews don't go well. I'm not good at talking to women despite being above average in attractiveness. I have a stubborn vain in my body from my Mom so I'm a hard person to anchor down because I don't like being anchored down. Stand-up is the purpose, there's nothing else that makes me feel as peaceful and I've been wanting to do it since 7th grade, started about 1.5 years ago. So the goal is to do stand-up, and build my life around that, because without I wanna kms.

The issue is I have this weird feeling of 'defeat'. I'll wake up, with no drugs, no masturbation, and silence from phones, and I will have this off feeling. Not miserable, not sad, just an emotional discomfort in my body I guess. For example, right now, i KNOW a shower would be able to turn my day around, but I have to go through my family to get there (I don't like talking to my family, they're not bad people, but I was raised with little supervision and just am very different from them, so I like to avoid conversation). I just can't do it, the 'defeat' feeling is in me and I just can't get past it.

Everything that could help, like making breakfast, going outside, and showering, happens in the space where my family is and today particularly, I can't stand the idea of being seen or having them offer food or ask how I'm doing. This has been going since I can remember being at my Mom's house. I know action would help, and I'm capable of showering, but the idea of ""going through people"" feels like such an impediment. I don't know if this is a bipolar issue or a general mental issue (I'm in therapy), but I don't know how to get past it, and it's the number one thing that makes a bad day even worse. It starts with the defeat feeling, and turns into anhedonia I guess. Any advice on getting past it or similar experiences would be appreciated.

Luxury buses were operating inside city limits before permitted time and occupying public road space. I parked my car on the government road (not blocking traffic, sitting inside, waiting 5 minutes for a takeaway order).

A group of 4–5 men, apparently bus owners/operators, approached me claiming the road was “their spot” because they own offices in the building.

When I told them I would leave in 5 minutes, the situation escalated. They threatened to beat me and break my legs. One of them grabbed me by the collar. This happened in broad daylight, in front of many people.

There are multiple CCTV cameras in the area and the buses are easily identifiable.

This isn’t just about one altercation. These buses operate aggressively during peak hours, and it’s honestly an accident waiting to happen.

How are private operators claiming public roads?

Has anyone else experienced similar behavior in Surat?

A full-size stroller is awesome at home like smooth ride, big basket, better recline and room for all the stuff babies need. But the second you try taking that giant thing through an airport, into a mall or into a compact trunk, the reality hits.

Here’s why people almost always end up with two:

**1. Full-size strollers are unbeatable for daily use**

Great suspension, comfy seats, big storage, better steering. Perfect for long walks, parks, and grocery runs.  
Common ones:

* UPPAbaby Vista
* Nuna Mixx
* Baby Jogger City Mini GT2

**2. They are a pain for travel**

Airports, rental cars, quick errands, this is where the big stroller becomes annoying. The fold is bulkier and airlines often gate-check them roughly.

**3. Compact strollers solve all the portability headaches**

Lightweight, fast fold, and small enough to toss anywhere. Many fold tiny enough for overhead bins.  
Examples:

* Babyzen YOYO
* Ergobaby Metro+
* Joolz Aer

**4. Each stroller has a different purpose**

* **Main stroller:** comfort, storage and long outings
* **Travel stroller:** portability, airports and quick errands

**5. You stop fighting the reality of convenience**

Once parents try travelling with a compact stroller, they usually keep using it for everyday things too doctor visits, daycare drop-offs, coffee shop runs.

That’s why most families land on the combo that actually works:

**• One full-size stroller for everyday life**  
**• One lightweight travel stroller for everywhere else**",1,1771026555.0,travelrecos,0,1.0,False
1r453op,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1r453op/should_i_quit_therapist_what_type_of_therapist_do/,Should I quit therapist . What type of therapist do I need.,"48 year old male. I was looking for a therapist for a specific problem (which of course is in the context of a lifelong depression off and on since ? Maybe 20).

Trying to address Enmeshment. And how I can get out of the below situation.

My parents are in their 80s and I live with them. My mother is undiagnosed BPD (or perhaps narcissist) and has no insight into her behavior and no interest in therapy. She verbally abuses my father who will not leave (I have no idea why. I think it is his views on marriage and their history together) I stay to help them ( she has some mobility issues and needs help with getting meals and a few other things). My father can help with all of this on his own but I help to ease burden. And my mother is much worse towards him when I am not around.

When I am around I think she tries to tone it down a little although she often has outbursts for ridiculous reasons. And she shouts about how her life turned out sometimes. 95% of the time it's fine but she uses her shouting to get her way with people. And it is driving me nuts. I have literally f\*d up presentations done on zoom because she is yelling about cold coffee.

I am staying as a buffer for my father AND I feel responsible for taking care of them and I think if I leave I will be increasing their suffering and in particularly lowering my father's quality of life further.  Her behavior is getting worse with time.

I am well aware of how nonsensical all of this is. But that doesn't make me able to walk away. Which is what I know I need to do.

My depression is getting worse. I now feel hopeless and think of death daily ( no SI no HI not a threat to self or others. I just think my life is worthless and the world will be better without me in it) .

For brevity I won't list all my symptoms etc. I am 10 sessions in with a therapist who said they have experience specifically with adult children of BPD who can address this issue.

I feel like my rumination runs me around in circles in therapy and the therapist may not be controlling this and I don't know if we have made any progress. She assigns homework and then doesn't get to addressing it next session because she starts the session with asking me what's happening this week and then we end up mostly talking about whatever happened that week. I am starting to feel like this is a copout.

She states she is experienced with family systems, psychodynamic, ACT and DBT (and narrative therapy) specifically to address situations like this.

I wanted to address this with her and today she cancelled our appointment via email about an hour and a half before it was to happen.

On an added note. If you think I should look for a therapist specifically trained or focused in an area please let me know as this would greatly help me. Bonus points if you can help me figure out how to find one ( it seems my area is filled with therapists who have less than 5 years experience but somehow are experts at dealing with almost everything) I apologize if what I just said offends you but some of you might also empathize with what I just wrote.

Our first four dates were really good and ll happened within a few weeks. Lots of talking and we went to a few art galleries and had a nice time. Physically he is average and sort of plain but his conversational skills made up for it. In other words when I like someone , I see beyond the physical.

Any way it has been really cold out and we decided to try the ice skating rink not far from my apartment. The night we went there was a wintry mix of snow and rain. He was not dressed adequately and was pretty cold. I was cold too and didn't feel like sitting in a coffee shop. I also needed to tend to my dogs because I didn't go home straight after work. He lives in Westchester country and had long train ride home. After three dates I figured it was safe to invite him up to warm up and I could let out my dogs, put on some tea. We were always talking about vinyl records which was a common interest.

When he got to my place he was looking at my vinyl record collection, was nice to my dogs, helped me take them to the dog run. We went back upstairs and that is when it got strange.  
We were in the kitchen I was warming some tea and he grabs me from behind. On earlier dates he was always the first one to kiss and would often do so without asking. I was attracted to him so I was ok but at this moment realized I really wasn't. I kissed him and finished making the tea. We drank some and then he takes my hands to stand up and starting leading me to my bedroom.

I was like ""Ummm this is fast for me. We are still getting to know each other.""  
He accused me of misleading him. He said it was alright but I felt bad. We talked for about another hour about work and other stuff. On the way down in the elevator he asked ""If I did this to other guys ?""

I said what. He sort of felt I tricked him and did it to make him feel rejected. While I could see he was disappoint I didn't let him in my bedroom, I didn't do anything on purpose. Our parting was warm but weird. I know his ex withheld sex as a weapon (or at least he told me that). I apologized and tried to be understanding. The next day he called to make another date and somehow we got into it about the other night. He started mentioning ""bitches who give men blue balls"" and I pushed back explaining I did not mean to make him feel like that.

1r4517l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r4517l,"If you're a cyclist, train your pyramidal muscles ✅","Telling you about the benefits of cycling, eating healthy, and doing #yoga is like telling you to bundle up when it's cold, or to drink water when you're thirsty…

It's still your decision, but are you paying attention to the signals your body is giving you?

Are you listening to your body?

Are you reading your body?

Are you observing your body?

I'll tell you a short, true story that led me to the practice of yoga, or rather, how it healed me.

It could be a love story, but I'll leave out the romantic part to keep the words flowing and prevent your coffee from getting cold.

I'm a cyclist, I love riding my bike, both in the city and far from it. As a cyclist, you work many muscles in your body, but not all of them. They even recommend swimming or going to the gym to strengthen the muscles you don't work as effectively while riding your bike. So, at this point, there's a gap that doctors and scientists are now filling, which is why they recommend it to all athletes and Olympic athletes.

I don't mean to say that you become a high-performance athlete, no! What I mean is that with so many years of cycling, I've strengthened some muscles more than others, and this creates an imbalance in the loads that we'll eventually be unable to handle… and that's how one day, after finishing my shower, I lifted one foot to help myself out, in what seems like a daily movement that requires no effort at all. Right! Well, when it's my left foot's turn, I feel myself shrinking, and a sharp pain invades my leg, buttock, and back, leaving me naked in the bathroom, almost immobile… my partner comes to my aid and helps me get dressed. The pain subsides after a few minutes, but it's difficult to maintain an upright position, and walking is even harder. The first doctor's diagnosis was confusing, but after some tests, another doctor gave me some relief.

The treatment was something I hadn't even considered. I couldn't picture myself immobile, taking anti-inflammatories and painkillers for six weeks. Just visualizing that for a few seconds depressed me. Then, my beloved partner, seeing my suffering, told me she had an alternative solution without medication (well, just a couple of days of anti-inflammatories), and that with it, my mobility would be restored in a few days.

I told her I wanted that option. What should I do? And she replied:

YOGA.

Coffee and yoga

So we started with a warm-up pose and then, a few minutes later, a strengthening one. The entire 40-minute workout focused on the piriformis muscle. Incredibly, after the first session, I already felt improvements in my mobility, to the point where I wanted to call it a miracle, magical. I did this 40-minute workout twice a day. After 5 days, I could walk without problems; I didn't feel any pain (in my glutes, legs, or sciatica-type pain) in my body. I almost felt the need to ride a bike, but that's where I was stopped. After 20 days of my yoga training, I felt strong enough to ride a bike, and it was a success.

Now I do exercises I previously thought were impossible, and I'm talking about calisthenics at a professional level (of course, I'm not an instructor, nor do I compete; I just do this for myself). Approaching 46, I feel great.

And this magic happens because yoga and calisthenics work all the connecting muscles, the ones that aren't on display in a bodybuilding competition. By working these hidden muscles, the body develops better communication with our brain, instantly increasing coordination, endurance, and body awareness.

Remember that the human body is the vehicle of our being, and just as you're surely attentive to the signals on your BMW, Mercedes, or Tesla's dashboard, you should also be attentive to your body.",0,1771026336.0,bicycling,23,0.23,False

So, as the title says, I recently met someone at a singles event. I feel like we hit it off pretty well, and she even gave me her number without my asking. I texted her a couple of days later, seeing if she wanted to get some coffee (her favorite). We initially scheduled our date two weeks after our first meeting, but then she said she had something going on that day so we rescheduled to when she was available, which is 20 or so days after. To me, it seems a bit odd, but I'm pretty patient, and she's worth it based on our initial interactions. My issue is that we haven't really had any conversations aside from planning our first date, and she hasn't really responded to my texts (I'm not bombarding her with messages since I learned my lesson about double/triple texting).

I keep a rather large pollinator garden and have a lot of birds that like to go through and eat bugs which is great. Unfortunately I also have a rather large fire ant problem. There’s a constant thick blanket of them and I can’t work in my garden without getting swarmed.

I’ve been looking into options that will deter the fire ants but are safe for the birds. I’ve seen diatomaceous earth, cinnamon, coffee grounds and molasses granules all mentioned as non-toxic alternatives, but usually in relation to pets, squirrels, rabbits etc. I haven’t seen birds mentioned.

Dried molasses granules seem the most promising as I’ve seen it mentioned as a treat for chickens but wanted to make sure it’s fine having spread around wild birds. I want to try to avoid diatomaceous earth as it would kill the spiders, beetles and other insects that crawl through. I just need a safe option that won‘t hurt birds if they ingest some or get it on them. I have a Carolina wren pair in particular I’m worried about since they really love to get into the planters and try to make nests.

Why was I worth the effort and goodness?,"This is a vent. I'm crying alone. I'm still legally married to my 30 year husband and I'm 19 male. I ended the marriage around Christmas, big emotions, he was getting verbally and emotionally abusive. I am still scared of him. I'm moving back home in 2 weeks, I just need to hold on until then. 

But, today, the ex went on a date with someone. Days before he said he was trying to find friends on apps made for finding friends. That's great. I support that. My ex isolates very often and hates leaving the house. Then, a few days later, he has me so confused. I don't want to be back with him, I want to be home. I want to feel safe and loved and adored. While playing around with me, my ex grabs me tightly and tongue kisses me. I try shoving him off and when he finally lets go, I'm shaking. He asks if I'm scared and I tell him I don't know. He hugs me and things go on as I'm hyperventilating. I'm a victim of SA multiple times in my past and he fucking knows that. 
Then, as I'm cleaning something, he says he has a date. I ask who, joke about it being a neighbor, etc. After he doesn't tell me and asks why I want to know, I stop asking. It's only when I walk away to wash my hands that he frantically says he's having coffee with a new friend. I say that's great. It is. 

The thing is, he lied. He came back today and told me how romantic the date was. How the new guy talked nonstop, how my ex drove them to a park, how they got coffee and walked around, how he wants a second date. I just finish making dinner, give my ex his food and I'm now in the guest room sobbing. 

Never in our marriage did he take me on dates. Never happily. He said he loved me then, but he never took me on dates like I asked. I wanted a picnic or going to a park or the zoo. Anything. The only time we had a ""date"" was when we had to wait for a friend to get off work and we went to the same park. He was pissy and didn't want to get out of the car, but I wanted to explore. I walked around and he eventually caught up, held my hand, kinda jokingly said I was being too gay, and we went back to the car. He's bought me food for home before. I just.. why. Why wasn't I worth the joy of a date? He said he loved me. He said he even loved me so much as I told him I wanted a divorce. He said he will always love me. After he forcefully kissed me, he says he loves me so much and I'm his little boy. I don't understand. I'm autistic. I'm confused. I'm overwhelmed. I'm crying. Why wasn't I worth goodness? 

I did all he asked, I stopped fighting back cause he got more angry and threatened to hit me or kill himself. I cook every single meal for him, I clean, I joke, I'm an actual person. Why wasn't I good enough? He said he would never date again after me and here he is, coming home from a date only 2 months after we separated. 
He used me for sex. He fucked me, didn't care if felt pleasure, then left me alone. I had to beg to be held after sex for 5 minutes. I cried when he did things to me and he has no understanding as to why when it's so obvious. 
I gave everything into this marriage. He sold my car, closed my bank account, I took care of so many expenses, I gave physical and emotional labour. His fucking dog he never trained ripped my hand finger open and now it hurts anytime anything happens besides normal touch. I fucking tried. Why wasn't I fucking good enough for a proper date? 

I texted my dad to ask to call him. He hasn't seen it yet. I'm very upset right now. He lied and used me. I want this divorce to fucking hurry up and I want to feel fucking cherished by someone. ",1,1771025863.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Hello Reddit,

Henk again.

After last post, I go deeper.
I sit behind my windows 95 PC from 1997.
Internet Explorer open.
Fan making helicopter noise.

I discover something shocking:

“Hydrocal” is not one universe.

It is multiple universes with same name.

Let me explain before somebody buy plaster instead of calibration fluid.


---

Part 1 – The Nijkerk Precision People

We start with the serious one:

Hydrocal Calibration Solutions

These people are not hobby store.
They are backstage technicians of civilization.

They make:

pH buffer solutions

EC (conductivity) calibration liquids

Measuring equipment


Sounds boring. It is not.

Because without calibration, numbers lie.

Where This Actually Matters

🏥 Hospitals & Labs

In hospital labs:

Dialysis fluid must have exact composition

Culture media for cells must be correct pH


If meter drift by 0.2?
That is not “close enough.”
That is problem.

So lab tech calibrates probe with certified buffer solution.

Behind patient safety = small bottle of reference liquid.

Nobody sees it.
But it is there.


---

🥤 Food & Drink Industry

Soft drinks. Yogurt. Sauces. Beer. Milk.

pH controls:

Taste

Microbial stability

Shelf life


Quality control department not guessing.

They calibrate daily.

Without that?

Sour milk surprise.
Exploding sauce bottle.
Brand reputation collapse.

Again: calibration liquid quietly preventing chaos.


---

🚰 Water Treatment & Environmental Monitoring

Before water leave treatment plant?
Measured.

Before wastewater released?
Measured.

Waterschappen test surface water quality.

pH and conductivity critical indicators.

Meters in field must be reliable.

Reliable = calibrated.

Civilization runs on reference solutions and coffee.


---

Part 2 – The Name Confusion Multiverse

Then Henk finds something funny.

Search “Hydrocal” online.

You get… not only calibration people.

You get:

🪨 Hydrocal Plaster (Model Builders)

There is product called “Hydrocal” used by hobbyists.

High-strength gypsum.
Model train mountains.
Fake rock formations.

If you accidentally use that instead of buffer solution, you have bad day.


---

⚙️ Hydrocal Industrial Lubricants

Yes.

Somewhere in industrial world, “Hydrocal” is lubricant line.

Hydraulic systems. Cooling systems.

You do not want that near your pH probe.

Trust me.


---

🔥 Hydrocal Fireproof Mortar

Also exists.

Fire protection coating material.

Very useful.

Not helpful for beer brewing.


---

Why This Matters

Names repeat.

Brands overlap.

Context is king.

If you need:

pH calibration

EC reference

Measurement accuracy


You look for the Nijkerk calibration specialists.

If you need fake mountain for model railway, you look somewhere else.

If you need hydraulic oil, definitely somewhere else.

Precision world and plaster world should not mix.


---

Henk’s Final Reflection

What I learn:

Measurement is serious business.
And internet is confusing business.

Behind hospitals, food factories, water plants – small invisible tools keep system stable.

Calibration is humility.

It says:

“My instrument drifts. I will correct.”

Maybe society also need buffer solution sometimes.

Too acidic politics.
Too basic opinions.

Maybe we need pH 7 moment.

Anyway.

Henk did research.
Henk slightly smarter now.

Please label your bottles clearly.

And now he has started a coffee community? Like what?! A COFFEE project? Seriously Paul Flynn? Is the coffee market now bigger than the CO₂ certificates? Bigger than bitcoin? Or why are you starting a new thing all over again, even though the last project has not been launched yet?

Hello Reddit,

Henk here again.
Yes. Same Henk.
Same PC. Probably same Windows 95 energy.

This time serious topic: beer brewing.
But also little bit chaos. Because Joop involved.


---

Why We Suddenly Care About pH Like Scientists

Joop say one evening:

“Henk, we go brew beer. Proper. Not bathtub nonsense.”

I say fine.

Then I bring my pH meter.
And calibration fluids from Hydrocal Calibration Solutions.

Joop laugh:

“We make beer, not rocket fuel.”

Two hours later he quiet.

Because pH is not joke.


---

Step 1: Calibrate Or Go Home

Before anything, we calibrate meter.

Buffer 7.01.
Buffer 4.01.

If you skip calibration, your numbers are fiction.

Meter must respect reference.

Joop try measure without calibrating once.

Reading say 5.4.
Reality probably 5.8.

That difference = enzyme sadness.


---

Step 2: Mash pH Is Holy Zone

During mash, enzymes convert starch to sugar.

Optimal pH = 5.2–5.6.

We measure after 10 minutes.

Reading: 5.9.

Joop say:
“Close enough.”

I say:
“No. Close enough is how divorces start.”

We add tiny amount lactic acid.
Stir. Wait. Measure again.

5.4.

Now alpha and beta amylase dancing like professionals.

Extraction better. Efficiency higher.

Beer future brighter.


---

Step 3: The Aldi Wine Experiment

After beer success, Joop get ambitious.

He buy grapes from Aldi.
From Germany. Discount destiny.

We crush them in plastic tub that probably once held paint.

We measure must pH.

3.9

Actually not terrible.

Joop want ignore.

I say:
“We are calibrated men now.”

We adjust slightly. Monitor fermentation.

pH drop during fermentation = good sign.
Yeast active. No bacterial party.

Wine taste… acceptable.
Better than expected.
Still slightly “budget romantic.”


---

Step 4: Why Calibration Matters (Real Talk)

Without calibration:

Mash conversion inconsistent

Tannins extract during sparge

Bitter harsh

Beer cloudy


With calibration:

Enzymes optimal

Wort clearer

Fermentation predictable

Flavor repeatable


Consistency is difference between hobbyist and accidental alchemist.


---

Step 5: Joop Goes Too Far

After three successful batches, Joop fully transformed.

He measure:

Tap water

Rainwater

His coffee

Possibly his own tears


He say:
“Henk, what is pH of friendship?”

I say:
“Stable. Around 7.2. Slightly basic. Good buffer capacity.”

We laugh.

But honestly:

Calibration teach discipline.

You admit instrument drift.
You correct before disaster.

Life lesson hidden in buffer solution.


---

Final Thoughts from Vroomshoop Brewing Lab

You do not need million-euro brewery.

You need:

Decent pH meter

Proper calibration fluids

Small syringe for acid adjustment

Patience

Slightly obsessive neighbor


Hydrocal calibration solutions not glamorous.

But they make your beer consistent.
And your Aldi grape wine slightly less embarrassing.

We started as two men with kettle.

We ended as calibrated gentlemen.

Now if you excuse me, Joop wants to measure the pH of his sourdough starter.

1r44l9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r44l9j/my_new_office_job_makes_me_decide_who_lives_and/,My New Office Job Makes Me Decide Who Lives and Who Dies.,"When my boss announced that the company had been sold, everyone was stunned. We’d heard rumors for weeks, sure… but none of us thought it would actually happen. Our main job was managing communication between banks and debtors, and none of us imagined it was doing that badly. Apparently it was.

After the announcement, the entire office grew tense. People were afraid they’d get fired or kicked out without warning. A couple coworkers didn’t even wait to see what would happen, they quit right away and found safer jobs. Two, sometimes three people disappeared every day.

For whatever reason, I decided to wait it out. My paycheck still came in, the workload stayed the same, and on the surface nothing had changed.

At least… not until that Monday.

When I walked into the office, the place was completely empty.
Not “slow morning” empty, abandoned empty.

My stomach dropped. Maybe I had made a huge mistake staying. Maybe I’d screwed myself right before Christmas, of all times.
As I stood there trying to process it, an unfamiliar man stepped out of my old boss’s office. Thin, short, slightly hunched, balding on top. He looked exactly like the kind of guy who had spent his entire life behind a desk.


“Ah, Mr. Cooper, finally! There you are!” he said, waving me over and hurrying toward me.


“Good morning… What happened?” I asked, still staring around the deserted office.


“We’re restructuring, Cooper,” the thin man said as he adjusted his glasses. “Otto. I’ll be your new supervisor.”


Restructuring. Of course. After being sold off, it was inevitable. I just nodded.


“Cooper, you’ll be getting a new office as well. A private one!” Otto said cheerfully as he motioned for me to follow.


A private office? Why me? I wasn’t anyone special. I wasn’t even particularly interesting. We walked down a long hallway and stopped in front of a door.


“This will be your new office,” Otto announced.


I glanced around. There wasn’t a single other door on the entire hallway.


“Uh… why am I getting my own office?” I asked.


“You’re an excellent employee, Cooper,” Otto said, patting my shoulder. “And it certainly helps that you’re the only one who came in to work today.”


“Oh… I see.”


I felt something sink inside my chest. Most of my coworkers had probably found new jobs. They just never bothered telling me.

Otto opened the door with a wide, almost celebratory smile, like he was presenting an award.

Inside was… a 6-by-6-foot hole in the wall office.
The desk barely fit in the room. On it sat an ancient yellowed monitor and an old corded phone that looked like something my grandmother would’ve used. One tiny window. Two massive filing cabinets. That was it.


“Ta-da!” Otto said proudly. “Your very own office, Cooper.”


“Yeah… well… uh…” I stammered. All I could think was: I need to quit.


“What’s the matter, Cooper?” Otto asked, sounding genuinely disappointed. “Something wrong?”


“Well, Otto… how should I put this… it’s a hole. And it doesn’t seem very modern. I don’t know…”


“I understand, I understand,” Otto said, nodding quickly. “Before you say anything else, let me give you your new employment contract.”


He stepped into the tiny room, grabbed a stack of papers, and handed them to me.
My new contract. The first thing I saw was the salary. Triple what I used to make.

What the hell? What exactly was I going to be doing here?


I was left alone in that pathetic little office. Otto hurried off after giving me a quick rundown of my duties, so I just sat there listening to the faint buzzing of the ancient CRT monitor.

My job was honestly the simplest thing I’d ever heard of. Otto had explained it, but I still didn’t believe it at first:
I had to use a single application. Profiles would appear, and I was supposed to either approve or deny them.

What exactly was I approving? 
He didn’t say. I assumed it was some kind of banking review process, same as before.

Otto only had one real requirement: process at least fifty profiles a day.
Other than that, I could do whatever I wanted as long as I respected the hours. My shift was strictly 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. According to Otto, being late wasn’t something they tolerated.

So I sat there waiting for the program to load on that prehistoric desktop.
The green-screen application finally booted up, and immediately popped up a welcome message:


“Welcome, Cooper! We hope you enjoy your new workspace. Good luck on your tasks!”


“Pff…” I muttered. “Typical office bullshit.”


I clicked OK. The system clearly wasn’t interested in small talk, the very next second, the first profile appeared.

A completely average woman.
Born in 1978, two kids, worked at a mall.
But her screen was filled with every imaginable detail: height, weight, education, parents’ names, kids’ names, her address… even the note that she’d been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier.

I scratched my head nervously.
Why the hell did I need this much information about a stranger?
Sure, banks love their paperwork, but this felt excessive. Like I was staring straight into someone’s entire life for no real reason.

I forced myself to push down the frustration and look at it “objectively.” This was just credit evaluation… or some kind of evaluation, anyway. Then, to calm myself, I said it out loud:


“Someone with two kids and cancer doesn’t need more debt.”


And I clicked Deny.


It was… an interesting job, to say the least.
The system just kept throwing profiles at me, one after another. All ordinary people, all normal-looking. And even though reading every detail of their lives felt uncomfortably invasive, I tried to make decisions using whatever “credit evaluator logic” I had left in me.

What bothered me, though, was that nowhere, literally nowhere, did it say what these people were even applying for. There was only the profile. No request. No description.
Just data.

I didn’t think too hard about it… at least not until the next profile showed up.

This one was different.

Half the sheet was blank.
No name. No birthdate. And instead of a photo, there was just a blurry smear, like someone had dragged wet paint across the screen.

Only the parents’ names were listed. Everything else was empty. A sea of white boxes.
I stared at the flickering monitor suspiciously.
What the hell is this? A glitch? Or something else entirely?
That’s when someone knocked on my door.


“Come in!” I said, spinning around in my squeaky chair.


The door swung open instantly, and Otto walked in with the same overly friendly, almost clumsy smile he always wore.


“Hello, Cooper!” he said cheerfully. “I see you’re having trouble with the system again…”


What the hell? Either this was a massive coincidence, or Otto was watching my screen.


“Uh… yeah,” I said carefully. “This profile is weird. Like… I don’t even know.”


“Yes, yes,” Otto interrupted, waving his hand dismissively. “It happens. The system isn’t modern. Lots of errors. But you don’t need to worry about that.”


He stayed friendly, too friendly, and that only made the whole situation more uncomfortable. Why did any of this exist if the data was this broken? What was even the purpose of my job? The old hardware, the strange profiles… the whole thing felt wrong.


“I can tell you’re confused, Cooper,” Otto said softly, as if he could read me. “Just focus on closing the profiles. Make the numbers move. I don’t care what you approve or deny. Just keep them flowing.”


“…Okay,” I muttered, sounding like a scolded kid.


“And what should I do with this corrupted one?” I asked, pointing at the screen.


“Whatever you want,” Otto replied casually. “Just close it.”


So I approved it.

I didn’t want to think about it any longer.
Deep down, I felt that if I started asking questions, if I looked even a little too closely, I’d end up in trouble I couldn’t get out of.



The past few weeks were nothing but work.
I know it's a stupid mindset, but I figured it was better not to ask questions. Keep your head down, do your job, and nothing bad happens.
Otto was pleasant enough, he’d pop in now and then to check on me, ask if everything was okay. The profiles kept flooding in like they’d never end. And I just kept clicking: approve, deny, approve, deny.

Truth is, I didn’t even know what I was deciding. I just kept hoping I wasn’t doing anything illegal.

The system was a mess. Half the profiles had missing or impossible data. Sometimes it threw children, teenagers, even newborn babies at me. I kept thinking—no way this was anything like credit evaluation. But Otto always reassured me, told me I was doing great, everything was fine.
That morning was no different.


“Cooper! My man! How’s the morning treating you?” Otto called as he walked in.


I was sipping my coffee, waiting for the ancient computer to boot up.


“Morning, Otto,” I said, setting my mug down. “All good… I just need to hit the dentist today. Think I could head out like twenty minutes early?”


Otto made a face like I’d personally insulted him.


“Oh, I’m sorry. But you know the rules. Work ends at four. Can’t let you leave early.”


I stared at him, shocked. I’d been here almost a month, never asked for anything, always did my job without complaint. And this was too much?


“I know you’re not happy about it,” Otto continued. “But that’s how it is, Cooper. No exceptions with work hours.”


“But Otto… I can make up the time,” I insisted.


He clicked his tongue and sighed dramatically.


“Sorry. Can’t do it. Reschedule the appointment. Sorry, Coop.”


Then he just turned around and walked off, that skinny little frame of his waddling down the hallway while he hummed to himself.


“Fucking asshole…” I muttered under my breath.


I closed the office door behind me.


That sad little hole I’d been working in for weeks had slowly become… almost cozy. I had a laptop for movies, a few books, even a mini-fridge. There was a kitchen, sure, but no one ever used it, and half the time I didn’t feel like leaving the room. So I made it my space.

Every day was the same. Profiles came in, and I picked yes or no.

I had just pulled a cold Coke out of the fridge when my computer made a weird chirping sound.

I turned back toward the monitor.

“THE NEXT PROFILE MUST BE APPROVED. This is important. Please comply.”

My stomach tightened.
Otto’s bullshit still burned in my chest, and for a second I actually considered denying it out of spite.
But this was my job. And even if my boss was a stiff-necked prick… I still had to do what they said.


I sipped my cold soda and deliberately took my time.

If they were going to be assholes to me, then fine, I could be a little petty too.

I set the drink down and clicked through the message. The next profile immediately flashed onto the screen. This was the one I had to approve.

The photo showed a rough-looking guy staring straight at me. The kind of man you hope you never run into on the street. According to the info, he was thirty-four years old, stocky, and on the shorter side.
But what really made my blood run cold were the highlighted notes:


“Highly aggressive. Multiple prior convictions.”


The green-tinted monitor flickered as I scrolled, my finger tense on the mouse.
The list grew worse and worse: unemployed for years, drug abuse, armed robbery, prison time for assault, I swallowed hard.

Why the hell would I need to approve anything for a man like this? Who was this Miles guy?
What did the system want from him? And what exactly was I approving here?

But the instruction had been clear. And the earlier message still echoed in my mind:


“This MUST be approved.”


So I clicked the Approve button.

For a moment, I waited. I don’t know what I expected, a red light flashing, a siren going off, Otto running in. But nothing happened.

The system just instantly loaded the next profile. Like it was any other day. And I just sat there. Why had this man been so important to approve? And what the hell had I actually authorized?


I finished my fifty profiles for the day.
I wasn’t in the mood for more, and honestly, I didn’t care. If Otto was going to be such an asshole, then this was the least I could do in return.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about Miles.
Why was he so important? Why did I HAVE to approve him? What was so special about him?

I still had plenty of time before four o’clock, so I sat there scrolling through the news on my phone, chewing on a piece of chocolate.

That’s when a headline popped up.

Something about it punched me right in the gut. And I normally avoided stories like this.


“Brutal Massacre at Christmas Market.”


I scrolled down slowly.


“More than 9 confirmed dead and at least a dozen injured.
The suspect was shot by police.
The perpetrator was the mentally unstable, repeatedly convicted 34-year-old Miles…”


My phone slipped out of my hand.

Miles.
The photo was the same. The exact same picture I’d seen on the profile. The man I approved. The man who then slaughtered a crowd of people.

My heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

Was this… my fault? The company told me to approve him. But what the hell had I actually approved?

My thoughts scattered in every direction. I could barely breathe. All I could see was the possibility that I had started all of this. Me. People died… because of me.

I grabbed my coat. I just had to get out. Didn’t matter where.
I reached for the door. It didn’t budge. I tried again. Pulled it. Shoved it. Kicked it.
Nothing.


“Fucking hell!” I screamed. “HELP! Somebody! Anyone!”


But no one came. The hallway was silent. Even the hum of the air conditioner faded, like the entire building was holding its breath.

I beat on that door for minutes, yelling until my throat burned, before collapsing back into my chair.
Sweat dripped under my coat, but I didn’t dare take it off. I told myself that if the door opened, I needed to be ready to run.

The monitor glowed green behind me, still flickering quietly.
My head throbbed. Then an idea hit me. If I couldn’t get out… at least I could find out if this was really my doing.
The plan was simple: Approve a profile, and then search the name online.

The first one was a young woman, nothing. Just social media.
Second: an elderly man, even less.
Third: a middle-aged woman, still nothing.

But the fourth was a bigger guy. I approved him. Waited a couple minutes. Then searched the name. What I found… hit me like a brick.

He was a former NFL player. And the news had been posted just minutes earlier:
He was dead. Car accident.
I sat there, pale and shaking. This job was so much more than I ever thought it was.


I don’t know how I survived those last few hours.
I chewed my nails down to nothing, my leg wouldn’t stop shaking, and I just stared at the constantly flickering monitor, waiting… for what, I didn’t know.

Then, exactly at 4:00 PM, the door clicked and swung open on its own.

Like someone out in the hallway had pressed an invisible button.

I launched out of that tiny office like an animal being released from a cage. I sprinted down the empty hallway, all the way back to my old workspace.
Nobody. The entire building was dead silent.

Except for the old boss’s office.
The light was on.

I didn’t even knock, I slammed the door open so hard it nearly ripped off the frame.

Otto was there.

Sitting at a narrow, uncomfortable-looking chair behind his desk. Stacks of paperwork in front of him. And he was stamping them. Over and over. Like nothing had happened.


“Jesus Christ, Otto! What the fuck IS this job?!” I screamed as I stormed in.


Otto finished stamping one more sheet before calmly lifting his head. His face was blank, like a bored supermarket cashier.


“What’s the problem, Coop? Your shift is over. You’re free to go,” he said, completely unfazed.


“DON’T PLAY STUPID WITH ME!” I roared. “These people died! DID I kill them?! What the fuck is going on here?!”


Otto didn’t blink. Didn’t change expression at all.


“Cooper, calm down. This is still a workplace, and I’m still your boss,” he said in a voice so cold it made my skin crawl.


“PEOPLE died because of my decisions!” I panted. “WHAT don’t you understand about that?!”


“And?” he asked, genuinely confused.


I froze.


“What do you mean ‘and’?” I shouted. “What IS this? Why did you do this?!”


“I didn’t do anything,” Otto said with a shrug. “You did, Cooper.”


“No! I didn’t know what I was doing!” I yelled. “And I’ll go to the police! I’ll tell them EVERYTHING! And they will believe me!”


Otto leaned back in his chair, fingers interlaced over his stomach, and let me scream.
He waited. Patiently. Like he knew none of this mattered.


“Are you done, Cooper?” he asked eventually. “Good. Then listen.”


He leaned forward. His voice no longer sounded human. Too slow. Too calm. Too measured.


“You didn’t kill those people. And neither did I. Let’s just say… it was their fate. Everyone dies eventually, Cooper.” My vision swam for a moment. “Now go home and rest,” Otto continued. “Tomorrow is another workday. You have a quota to meet.”


“Fuck this…” I gasped. “I quit. Consider this my resignation.”


Otto’s lips curled into a smile.
Not a friendly one. A smile that turned my stomach to ice.


“You can quit, Cooper. But the notice period is thirty days. It’s in your contract. And another thing… if you quit, someone else will take your place. There is always someone else.” He stood up. Walked toward me slowly. Stopped right in front of me. “And your profile is in the system. Just like everyone else’s. If a new employee sees it… what do you think they’ll do?”
His voice dropped lower, deeper, resonating like something vibrating beneath the floor. “‘I don’t know this guy. I’ll approve him.’” He leaned in closer.
“And then, Cooper… you’re dead. Just like that. That’s fate.”


I stood there, frozen, mind blank, unable to speak or move.
Otto sat back down, resumed stamping forms like nothing had happened.
And all I could think was…

Straight from the land of pasta, wine, and coffee, we are bringing you the incredible gifted Marco Pastorino.



He’s stepping away from massive festival stages, bigger venues and leaving his bands Temperance, Virtual Symmetry, Serenity, and Fallen Sanctuary home. He is just coming to us with just his voice, his guitar, his heart and passion!



To keep this experience unique, we have carefully handpicked  intimate, small capacity venues. This isn't just a concert; it’s a chance to witness the incredible versatility and soul of Italian metal up close.



This is Personal. This is Rare- Be There! Meet & Greet Offer



Marco is also doing something we’ve never seen before. Beyond the handshake, the signature, and the professional portrait by Golden Dragon Photo, he is offering you a moment that will stay with you forever. Imagine this: Marco, standing right in front of you, singing a song chosen by you. Whether it’s a powerhouse track from one of his bands or a song that has defined your life, he will perform it just for you in this intimate setting of just a handful of people.

Explanation on Show + Meet & Greet [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxhYXumgtqRmcwkF91gvIvFMl2BYEVkB](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxhYXumgtqRmcwkF91gvIvFMl2BYEVkB)



Come join us for a truly intimate event where the music is personal and the connection is real. Limited Seats are available, especially for Marco’s Meet & Greet, to give you a truly special and up-close experience.



DUBLIN | SATURDAY, 21st FEB

📍 Wild Duck

⏰ 19:30 – 20:30 (Opening for Marco)

⏰ 20:45 - 22:15 Marco

🎟️ €14,95



BELFAST | SUNDAY, 22nd FEB

📍 Oh Yeah Centre

⏰ 19:30 – 20:30 (Opening for Marco)

⏰ 20:45 - 22:15 Marco

🎟️£8.49



To warm up and ignite the room, Alex & David from Brake Loose will take the stage (19:30 – 20:30) the only way they know how: pure rock 'n' roll madness and maximum craic.  Making it way different than their last acoustic set at the Ink.



It’s the kind of performance where the stage and the crowd disappear into one, an hour of rock 'n' roll where the setlist is a two-way street. The guys will be performing stripped-back versions of their brand-new singles alongside their music and timeless classics like ""Rebel Yell"" by Billy Idol. But here’s the kicker: the direction of the night is entirely up to you. For these sixty minutes, the crowd is in the driver’s seat. In short, you set the vibe, call the shots and they will bring the noise. Their  set will be pure rock 'n' roll madness in its most intimate form and due to this we’re keeping this experience unique and up-close.



We hope to see you on our Special Evening and Create Together a Once Lifetime Exerpience, have a great weekend!

1r44gln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letshearyours/comments/1r44gln/the_moments_before_and_after_09062025_730am_on_a/,The moments before and after 09/06/2025 7:30am on a raining morning,"I'm on the phone with someone, I don't know who because it's an unsaved number. The call ends.

When did I get on a call with someone, who was that even?

'Zo... are you awake?' My dad (d) opens the door and comes into my room. I look up at him and then pick up my phone to check the time: 5:34am, and then I see 3x missed calls from an unsaved number, the same number.

'Yeah, I'm awake. What's wrong?' I ask.

He looks a bit frantic but still carries his calm composure. 'The hospice called... we need to go.'

I get out of bed and attempt to steady myself. 'Ok, let me just get dressed quickly.' He nods and leaves to go to his room.

Now being fully stood up I realise... fuck...

I walk down to the car. My dad's there and ready to go. The drive isn't long, maybe 10min if the roads are clear, but it felt like an hour. Slowly everything starts setting in. Why would they call my dad at 5 in the morning? Why are we going to the hospice?

'What's going on?' I ask him.

He sighs. 'The hospice called.' I already know this.

'Yeah, I know that, but why so early?' He quiets. I look down at my pants, realizing that I picked the worst pair I own, marked with nail polish, acetone, and a whole lot of glitter. I did my nails in these pants. She hates these pants. Never in your life will you wear those pants outside again. I giggle at the reminder.

'They say it's not looking good,' he says.

A bomb just got dropped in my head, or my heart, or my being, I can't decide.

'What else did they say?!' It baffles me because of how fast I could still be half-asleep and swap into stone-cold sober in 2.36 seconds.

'Just that we should go, just in case.'

I don't say anything for the rest of the ride.

The second we've parked, I jump out and start heading in to file the visitation form. But halfway, a nurse lady asks, 'You're here for Fouché?'

'Uh yeah, I am.' I put the pen down with a slight tremor in my hand. They're always so strict on the visitation forms.

'You can go to her, we'll sort it out.' I thank her and walk to my mom's room.

When I open the door, I'm expecting chaos, but there's none. Just my mom's best friend, Vanessa (V), and my stepdad. Ugh. I look at V, then at my stepdad, they look calm. I move to sit on the lounge couch in the corner of the room. My dad comes in and says he needs to go home to open up the house for the dogs and workers. I fall asleep there.

I wake up to my stepdad shaking me. I look at the time, it's 7:20am now. I've had a decent nap. I look up at V and my stepdad; they look upset, slowly shaking their heads, like they're busy delivering news that shouldn't be delivered to a 17-year-old.

'It's over.'

WHAT.

I look at my mom, but she looks fine. Well, for a breathing stage 4 cancer patient who's basically unresponsive, she looks fine. A nurse walks in and confirms she's still fine. What a rude awakening.

I stand up and go sit on the chair by my mom. The other two leave to get coffee.

I move my hand to hold hers. She takes my hand as well, but weakly. I look at her, but she's looking up, or maybe at the corner of the room. I lean my head on the bed railing, to be able to see her. She's breathing. I look at my phone: 7:28am. Gosh, it's still so early. I look outside the room's floor-to-ceiling window. It's storming. There are a bunch of birds on the floor eating scraps from the ground. How lovely.

I look at the time: 7:30, and then back at my mom... she's not breathing.

I move closer to see if she is, or maybe it was just my eyes not picking it up. I move closer... she's not breathing. Alarm bells start going off in my head. She's breathing, wait... no, she's not breathing. I feel her pulse. Nothing. I put my hand on her chest. Nothing. She's...

V and my stepdad walk in, coffee in hand. They look at me. I shake my head. V bursts into tears. My stepdad just stands there. I get up and walk out.

I walk into the hall and call my sister

Dialling Monique

(m) 'Hey Zo, what's up?' (z) '......I'm sorry.' (m) 'Why... you did nothing wrong... Zo... what's happened?'(z) 'It's over.'(m) 'What...' 

Call ended

I walk a step further and call my dad (d).

Dialling Dad

(d) 'What's up? Everything ok?'

(z) '......It's over, dad.'

(d) 'Ok, I'm coming.'

Call ended

What do I do now? Go on a walk. So I go for a walk. I didn't know what else to do. While I'm walking, one of my mom's friends (EL) drives in. Well, people obviously know already... damn, she died less than 5 minutes ago. I shake my head. She sobs and drives further.

I sit on a chair in the parking lot. My dad comes in and parks. He gets out and walks to me. 'Are you ok?' he asks. I nod. He hugs me, and we go back into the hospice.

It's chaos. Of course it's chaos. My dad and I go to get coffee. He asks me what happened. I try, but choke on my words, so I write it on my phone: |I held her hand when it happened|.

He nods and hugs me.

45 minutes later

I'm sitting in the room with my mom, just holding her hand and sorting everything through in my head. Then I feel two arms wrap around me. I'm absolutely engulfed in perfume, my sister's perfume, and turn to hug her, shoving my face into her. It feels like a form of protection. And I realize... my mommy's gone. I'm never gonna see her again. I sob for the first time.

One week later, her funeral.

I wasn't present, physically yes, but in every other aspect, I was not.

I slept at my best friend's house that night. Too scared of being alone. If I was, I wouldn't have survived.

In the span of one week, my whole world ended, but everyone else's kept going, which meant my life would still have to.

Grief never ends. It's unpredictable. It's painful. It's part of living.

250 days later

It's raining. It reminds me of her. Maybe she's crying for us? Maybe...

I love butterflies. I always greet them. Maybe she's with one of them.

I speak of her like she's still here, in her house with her dogs. I correct myself—not all the time though, only sometimes.

The world unfortunately does go on, it does care about your problems, you move with it, not it with us, and you make do you survive, you find your reasons, your reasons will make a endless grieving a bit more bearable, it will hurt, it won't get better. It becomes quieter

In 2024 June 9 7:30 am my world ended, but life kept going and I found my support to keep going with them

Thank you to my family and friends

 What can I say I like earth tones 😝 the last 2 years I’ve been all another burgundy and brown. 

Fig is pretty, but not sure how much I’m gonna really use it. It’s sorta like oxblood for me, love it but harder to match. Especially when you have chocolate plum which remains the standout neutral for me. 

I ordered toasted almond with the idea or returning it but plays well next to coffee and chocolate plum and jt’s actually a lovely cocoa color.  Hard to capture in a pic next to darker colors. On the other hand coffee is very photogenic but less brilliant in person. Still a lovely shade. 

Second picture my marine triad: navy, deep sea and seafoam; followed with a comparison of celadon next to seafoam. IRL celadon is the most conventionally spring color baggu has released this season. Less saturated than seafoam, closer to pea or a light mint. Pretty, not sure if I really needed it having seafoam. If you hate how seafoam photographs, I think celadon is worse.

What can I do?,"Some context: Burner account. I'm male, 24, I currently weight 88.8kg, 1.8 meters. I am not physically active and I work a desk job, however a big part of my commute to work is walking, I walk around 3km to work(I take about 30-35 min) before I take trains and buses, and then I walk some more(not a very long distance, about 3-5 more minutes walking). And the way back home is the same way. Total commute is around 1 hour 30 minutes.

I bring food to work in a pot/lunchbox that can hold 500ml of water.

Every day we eat beans and rice, plus something else with the food(meat, some vegetable, anything). I began cutting on food and making smaller plates, plus I stopped getting breakfast or coffee at 06AM, now the first time I eat is at lunch. I work from 09:00 to 16:00, and I get home at around 18:00.  
I don't normally cook, generally my mother is the one who does the cooking, we eat rice, beans everyday, plus generally fried or cooked eggs, or anything else.

Now here's the issue:

I don't control what we will have for dinner, I just buy whatever she wants me to or she buys things herself. If I mention to her I'm in a cut she says fine, but then she keeps pushing food on me; if I refuse she begins making fun of me or talking badly about me. I don't fight her, I just comply. She baked cake yesterday and today again, I got one slice and went to my room, then she told me to get some more, I refused, and after a few minutes she yelled at me to get more, so I just went and got a few more. When she doesn't yell she makes it clear that she's not fine and the ambient gets a bit heavy, so I just go and get something anyway.

Similar things happen with other meals, she generally cooks oily things, sausages, etc. If I take too little or she sees that it's remaining more than she expected to, she asks if I already ate.

I overate yesterday and I still feel bad about it.

I actually managed to lose some weight since the start of january, where I was weighing around 90-91kg, but I feel like this situation is holding me back and I'll end up stuck in the weight I'm currently at.

My plan is specifically weight loss. How can I make a situation where I'm losing weight without getting in conflict?",14,1771024700.0,TooAfraidToAsk,31,0.77,False
1r44edi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1r44edi/cost_of_entry_in_relationships/,Cost of Entry In Relationships,"I see a lot of posts/comments here from women who say some attributes are just the cost of entry. For those who have been in long term relationships like 10+ years, was the cost of entry worth it? Have those little annoyances become louder or fade with time?

I bring this up because I've been with my partner for 13 years. He's Type B. I'm Type A. The cost of entry for our relationship is he forgets everything and is disorganized. Always scrambling last minute but somehow it always works out.

In the beginning I used to always try to save the day, now I don't even think twice when he loses his wallet. But one thing that has become unbearable is how disorganized he is. Just putting things where they don't belong at all. Random tupperware in the coffee and tea section. Advil in the spice cupboard. Cups where plates and bowls are on the other side of the kitchen.

I'm highly sensitive to my environment and I can't think straight when there is visual chaos. Sometimes I just dream about living alone in a perfectly organized house where I wasn't picking up after anyone. I feel like I would be so much happier.",88,1771024691.0,AskWomenOver30,67,0.93,False

DUBLIN | SATURDAY, 21st FEB

📍 Wild Duck

⏰ 19:30 – 20:30 (Opening for Marco)

⏰ 20:45 - 22:15 Marco

🎟️ €14,95



BELFAST | SUNDAY, 22nd FEB

📍 Oh Yeah Centre

⏰ 19:30 – 20:30 (Opening for Marco)

⏰ 20:45 - 22:15 Marco

🎟️£8.49



To warm up and ignite the room, Alex & David from Brake Loose will take the stage (19:30 – 20:30) the only way they know how: pure rock 'n' roll madness and maximum craic.  Making it way different than their last acoustic set at the Ink.



It’s the kind of performance where the stage and the crowd disappear into one, an hour of rock 'n' roll where the setlist is a two-way street. The guys will be performing stripped-back versions of their brand-new singles alongside their music and timeless classics like ""Rebel Yell"" by Billy Idol. But here’s the kicker: the direction of the night is entirely up to you. For these sixty minutes, the crowd is in the driver’s seat. In short, you set the vibe, call the shots and they will bring the noise. Their  set will be pure rock 'n' roll madness in its most intimate form and due to this we’re keeping this experience unique and up-close.



We hope to see you on our Special Evening and Create Together a Once Lifetime Exerpience, have a great weekend!

To be upfront, I’m a virgin and have never seriously dated anyone. I’ve not been interested—so far, my need for company has been fulfilled by friends and my need for sex has been fulfilled by myself.

In the past when I’ve gone on first dates with men I’m already friends with, it’s been comfortable. But blind first dates I’ve gone on have been so horrible and awkward. I don’t know if it’s nerves, but so many men don’t know how to have a conversation. I’m a wonderful conversationalist. Like, I don’t consider myself a beautiful woman, but I can flex my ability to make friends easily. I love to talk and listen to other people talk. But on dates, men respond to my questions like I’m a female praying mantis who’s about to bite their head off or something.

So now that I’m deciding to give dating another shot, I’ve vowed NO MORE GOING FOR COFFEE OR DINNER ON FIRST DATES. This time, I’m doing going to ask guys to do an activity with me. I’m hoping that will make conversation a little easier, since they can talk about what we’re doing instead of themselves. (I get that’s hard for some dudes, and as an ex-loner, I empathize.)

I’m almost always the one that does the asking out, so I get to pick the spot. In your experience, what are some fun activities to do on a first date? I’d love to hike or mini golf, maybe go to a theme park or arcade bar. But what do guys like? (Don’t say sex, you animal.) I don’t really want to invite a stranger to my place, so it has to be a public setting.",13,1771024582.0,AskMenAdvice,69,0.93,False
