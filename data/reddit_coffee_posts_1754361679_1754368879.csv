There is a few things I miss from the V Touring. The IMO the segmented LED headlights seemed to light the road better but the Projector LEDs have far better down road light and after swapping in the LEDs in the high beams. My auto high beams work 300x better. 

Anyway at the shop today we have a 2022 Passport Sport. And of course I have to play a bit. I like the bigger LCD display on the Passport cluster vs the tiny one the Ridge has. But what surprised me on the Ridge was its lack of a few menu screen items (coffee break and the Traction Screen) and the Passport Sport has both. 

I doubt it’s possible as I’m sure the communication is different but swapping in the Passport Cluster to the Ridge. 

Other thing that surprised me was the cloth seats in the Passport are far more comfortable and better bolstered than the “leather” seats in the Ridge. 

Just a few things. Nothing major. Ridgeline has done everything I have needed it to do and more. Climbed up a mountain and like the pic shows even played on the sand right before the cyclone hit before Thanksgiving last fall. The AWD is far better and handles way better than the CRV. 

And bonus points is I paid the thing off last month. Now let the mods begin. OEM plus mods. Probably a leveling kit. Different wheels off a Pilot or Passport. Not a fan of the “generic” grey wheels on a full trim rig, my V has some really nice wheels.  

Putting some power options in the back with the inverter to power my amateur radio go kit. Have the bed tent. Need to build a step that slips into the receiver.  

Have a list of OEM options I’m going to add. Running boards, I’ll add my own entry lights, roof rails and cross bars. NoLo makes some brackets to mount ditch lights I’ll use to mount antennas off the a pillars.

## key Features Analysis

The key to a great Kona coffee K-Cup lies in several factors, from the sourcing of the beans to the quality of the brewing technology.**Authenticity and Bean Certification:** This is the single most significant feature. Look for K-Cups that clearly state the percentage of Kona coffee they contain, and ideally, boast certification from the Kona Coffee farmers Association (KCFA). True Kona beans are relatively rare, so 100% Kona K-Cups will command a premium price. Be wary of blends that do not specify the Kona percentage.

A Certificate of Origin, a stamp displayed on packaging, will guarantee the authenticity of beans.

**Roast level Consistency:** The roast level significantly impacts the coffee's flavor profile. K-Cups should maintain a consistent roast, typically medium, to highlight the unique characteristics of Kona beans. Variations in roast level within the same batch can lead to inconsistent and undesirable results.

This will allow the most pleasing notes of Kona coffee to sing in each cup.

**Packaging and Preservation:** K-Cups need to preserve the freshness and aroma of the coffee beans. Look for packaging that uses airtight seals and nitrogen flushing to minimize oxidation and degradation. Some manufacturers even utilize multi-layered materials to further enhance protection.

This will keep the K-Cups consistently delicious over time.

**K-Cup Compatibility:** Ensure the K-Cups are compatible with your Keurig brewing system.While most K-Cups adhere to industry standards, variations in design can occasionally cause issues with certain models. Check the packaging for compatibility data or consult the manufacturer's website.

This will allow for no-hassle brewing and maximum convenience.

**Brewing Technology Optimization:** Certain K-Cups incorporate features designed to optimize the brewing process within Keurig machines.These may include specialized filter designs or flow control mechanisms that ensure even saturation and extraction, resulting in a more flavorful and balanced cup of coffee.

This can take your Kona coffee K-Cup experience to the next level.

**Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing:** Look for brands that prioritize sustainable farming practices and ethical sourcing. This includes fair wages for farmers, environmentally amiable cultivation methods, and certifications like Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance. Choosing these options supports responsible coffee production and helps ensure the long-term health of the Kona region.Doing this helps support the farmers of one of the most sought-after coffees in the world.

Kona coffee K-Cups provide several key benefits for consumers who value convenience and quality.

**Convenience and Speed:** The primary benefit of K-Cups is unparalleled convenience. Brew a single cup of Kona coffee in under a minute, without the need for grinding, measuring, or cleaning. This is ideal for busy mornings or when you only want a single serving.

This is the perfect solution for those quick caffeine fixes.

**Consistent Quality:** Reputable Kona coffee K-Cup brands maintain consistent quality and flavor profiles across each cup. This removes the guesswork involved in conventional brewing methods and ensures a reliably enjoyable experience every time.

Consumers are in control,knowing exactly what they are going to get.

**Reduced Waste:** Single-serve K-Cups eliminate the waste associated with brewing larger pots of coffee that go unused. This makes them a more environmentally friendly option for individuals or small households.

This helps you avoid throwing away half a pot of wasted coffee.

**Variety and Experimentation:** The availability of different Kona coffee blends and roast levels within the K-Cup format allows for experimentation and customization. Explore various options to find your perfect cup and tailor your coffee experience to your individual preferences.

The numerous blends offer something for every palate.**Portion Control:** K-Cups provide precise portion control, helping to manage caffeine intake and avoid overconsumption. Each K-Cup contains a pre-measured amount of coffee, making it easy to track your daily consumption.

This helps avoid getting the jitters from too much caffeine.

1mhzmhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Carry-8494/comments/1mhzmhz/personalized_cat_dishes_a_stylish_and_practical/,Personalized Cat Dishes: A Stylish and Practical Touch for Your Feline Friend,"Cats are more than just pets—they're cherished members of our families. Just like people, they appreciate routine, comfort, and even a bit of style in their daily lives. One of the most overlooked yet important parts of a cat’s day is mealtime. The dish your cat eats from can affect not only their health but also their feeding habits and overall experience. That’s where [**personalized cat dishes** ](https://www.furvorite.com/CAT-BOWL/)come in. These customized bowls aren’t just cute; they serve a functional purpose by catering to your cat’s unique needs and personality.

**Adding a Personal Touch to Mealtime**

Personalized cat dishes allow pet owners to bring a special flair to their cat’s daily routine. These dishes can be customized with your cat’s name, a special design, or even a color scheme that matches your home décor. Whether you’re buying for your own pet or looking for a thoughtful gift for a fellow cat lover, personalized dishes make mealtime feel more special. These little details may seem small, but they reflect the love and care you have for your pet. Just like we enjoy using our favorite coffee mug, cats enjoy consistency and familiarity—especially if their dish is distinct and comfortable to use.

https://preview.redd.it/03sd6m0lo4hf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=572fb38556b49eebaed0df54e23ee153dc90b982

**Practical Benefits for Health and Hygiene**

Beyond aesthetics, personalized cat dishes offer real health and hygiene benefits. Many of these custom bowls are available in materials such as stainless steel, ceramic, or BPA-free plastic—each with its own advantages. Stainless steel is highly durable and resistant to bacteria, while ceramic dishes are stylish and easy to clean. Custom dishes often come with options tailored to your cat’s needs: elevated dishes for older cats with joint issues, shallow bowls for cats with flat faces like Persians, or slow-feed bowls for overeaters. A dish designed specifically for your cat’s size and feeding habits can prevent messes, reduce strain on their neck and joints, and promote better digestion.

**Ideal for Multi-Cat Homes**

In households with more than one cat, personalized dishes become even more valuable. Feeding multiple cats in the same space can be tricky, especially if one cat tends to dominate mealtime or has dietary restrictions. Personalized bowls with each cat’s name help distinguish whose dish is whose, preventing confusion and potential food stealing. This is particularly useful if some cats are on special diets or need medication mixed into their food. Separate, identifiable bowls can help you monitor each cat’s eating habits more accurately and ensure they’re getting the right nutrition.

**Stylish Options to Suit Every Taste**

One of the best things about personalized cat dishes is the wide variety of styles and designs available. You can find minimalist ceramic bowls etched with elegant calligraphy, playful dishes with cartoon illustrations, or even high-tech bowls with built-in scales or timers. Some companies offer handcrafted, artisanal bowls made from eco-friendly materials, while others let you upload your own artwork or choose from pre-made patterns. Whether your home is modern and sleek or warm and rustic, you can find a dish that complements your aesthetic while serving a practical purpose for your cat.

**Caring for Your Personalized Cat Dish**

To make the most of your personalized cat dish, it’s important to keep it clean and well-maintained. Depending on the material, many dishes are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning a breeze. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive pads that might damage custom prints or engravings. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent bacteria buildup, especially if your cat eats wet food. Additionally, keep an eye out for signs of wear—such as chipping in ceramic bowls or scratches in plastic—that could harbor bacteria or pose a risk to your cat. With proper care, a personalized cat dish can remain a functional and stylish part of your cat’s life for years to come.

**Conclusion**

Personalized cat dishes are more than just a decorative item—they’re a thoughtful investment in your cat’s health, happiness, and comfort. By selecting a dish tailored to your pet’s unique needs, you’re showing love in one of the most important areas of their daily life: mealtime. Whether you’re solving a practical issue like portion control or simply want to make your cat feel a little more special, a custom dish is a charming and useful solution. With so many styles and materials to choose from, it’s easy to find one that’s perfect for both your cat and your home.",1,1754367936.0,u_Curious-Carry-8494,0,1.0,False

Okay so I was listening to the last episode of We So Cultured (if you know, you know), and they were talking about how men in Africa or the Middle East are so different from men in America. Like, over there? Men will SEE beauty, and they will ACT ACCORDINGLY. Compliments will be flying, shots will be shot.Sometimes even too much 😭. But here in North America? Dead silence not even a stare

And one of the guys made a good point he literally said a lot of men here have been called out for flirting or complimenting women so much that now they just don’t do it anymore. They’re scared to come off as weird or pushy. And honestly? I can’t even disagree. I’ve been here for a year and a half now and no one has approached me unless it’s a crackhead asking for change. It had me questioning my whole look like, Did I lose my glow or something ??

UNTIL TODAY.

I’m on my way to work, feeling myself walked in to grab my usual coffee, and boom this guy starts chatting me up.Man looked me dead in the eye and said, “Hey, you look really pretty.”

Y’ALL.

I froze for a second. Said thank you,but in my head I was like: IS THIS REAL LIFE? IS THIS MY MOMENT?!

Then he’s like, “You know any good restaurants around here?” 
I give  him a couple suggestions, and then he  hits me with:
“Can I have a chance with you?”

💀💀💀

I politely declined (I'm not available, but I appreciated the vibe!), and he goes, “All good, have a great day,” and walked away with grace. No weird energy, no pressure, no “you ugly anyway” tantrum and I didn’t made him feel bad or weird too about it either

It's unorthodox and not what I prefer, but this is the closest group and I'd feel like a dick interrupting the meeting and going against group norms by showing up ""on time"" 30 mins later. The attending members were the group leader, the women's group leader, and a woman I've never seen before. Pretty soon after the music starts, a man I've seen a few times walks in. Then another Man, whom I have never seen before, comes by and asks if this is the recovery meeting, the group leader says yes and the man joins us. When asked the man says his name is Douglas. The man I've seen a few times has a brief conversation that I didn't hear with the group leader, then walks out. After music and recorded lecture there is a 10-minute break where the group leader helps me put the water on for tea. Before the men's recovery meeting starts I tell the group leader that when I'm recognized I will go and make myself a cup of tea before I share. When the meeting starts Douglas shoots the breeze with the group leader instead of introducing himself as an alcoholic/addict. Somehow he gets the group leader talking about the friends he lost from the military. At some point Douglas says ""I don't know what that's like..."" it struck me as odd because I think I remember that part of the conversation being something about using, so, if he belonged in the group, he would know what that's like, or at least wouldn't say he didn't know.. The group leader attempts to recognize me for my share but Douglas keeps talking. When they finish speaking and recognize me for my share I leave the room and make tea like I told the group leader I would. I try and share about a person who died recently whose funeral I went to. During a brief period of silence, Douglas asks me if this is my first meeting. The group leader and I say no. I paused for a little while longer and then start talking about my first experience drinking as that's what I had planned to talk about. Then I don't remember what I was talking about, but Douglas interrupted again to ask me why I wasn't looking at them when I talked. I replied that it it was something of a group norm and the group leader said ""it's hard to process"" During another fallow period in my speech, he rapidly changed the subject to biking. Me and the group leader, not used to crosstalk, let him. We then talked about homelessness and I shared that I wanted the group to buy socks with it's (6th? 7th?) tradition money for potential group members that might be experiencing houselessness and related the request back to my experience. At some point Douglas asked what I did and I told him. The group leader thanked me and asked me to pray them out, and I said something like ""dear Lord, I hope that Douglas got what he came for, I hope that [group leader] appreciates God's forgiveness for the deaths of his friends, if he is responsible for them, which he probably isn't. And I hope that I can stay on the path. Thank you, Amen.""

The group leader invited me to meet him at church in the mornings at 8 and as I left started asking Douglas how he heard about the meeting.

The whole thing strikes me as odd. My operating theory is that he's from the Alano hall in the nearest city and his role is to evaluate whether or not the group ought to be listed in AA brochures and web domains. The only evidence I can offer is that the AA brochures are missing from the lit stand at the local hospital. Does anyone have insight into this?

———————————



So I went to this coffee shop after work today. 

And I met this guy, and I have never and I mean ever felt this way about something I just met. 

We hit it off immediately, idk why I said to him “sorry if I’m bothering you, I talk a lot when I’m nervous” he said “I like hearing you talk” 

2 hours went by. And we had so much in common


Idk if there was real body chemistry. His knees kept touching mine, he touched my shoulder. He said he found me funny. 

Idk if I’m just reading into it. I told him I worked at an eye clinic and eye have glasses, cause I noticed he was wearing glasses. He said “oh good, I need to get my eyes checked”

He then told me he actually lived 2 min from my job. He then asked me what days I’m working so he can stop by. 

Idk, I’m back into the dating world after having a baby last year. I did mention that to him, he then said “good, put your child first”. I told him my daughter’s name and he said there’s a song about her name. Even though it’s not a common name. He played it on his phone and let me listen. 

We talked about our childhoods, there was so much in common we had even though we grew up in different cultures. 

 He said he speaks Spanish and said he could teach me when I had a chance. 

I didn’t realize the time and said I needed to go home.

1mhz94j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mhz94j/black/,BLACK,"Within a secure meeting room in the belly of the Office of Neural Health at Hatnode, eight men, each dressed in dark, immaculate suits, sat around a long mahogany table. The wood was old and smooth beneath their restless hands.



No one rushed to speak.



The eldest among them finally broke the hush, his voice low and weary. “It’s trauma from the Incident,” he said, staring at the reflections in his untouched drink. “You can’t witness that much death and expect people to be okay. The average citizen has probably seen more death than the coroners of the past.”



The man closest to the security display didn’t look away from its shifting glow. “It’s not just trauma,” he said, calm but certain. “These cases are almost identical. The same stories, over and over. People frozen in their beds, seeing things. The Red-Eyed Man. The Hatman. The Old Hag. People are starting to experience some of these hallucinations while awake.”



Another man, thin and anxious, spoke next. “The Smiling Visitor. The Backwards Woman. The Hanged Child. There are basically a dozen of these entities that seem to exist across the world. We think the Hanged Child and the Backwards Woman probably came from cross-contamination with another world. Reports of them are in their history books, not ours. And suddenly, after they bring in a group of refugees, those figures start showing up? That’s not normal.”



The hum of filtered air filled the silence between them, each man weighed down by memory and unease.



“Plus, take a look at this.” The man operating the display shifted the screens to a new report. “Some people in another world, with no previous record of the Hatman, have begun to see him after one of our soldiers with a history of these experiences visited their world. Whatever that thing is, it spreads! That’s not just psychological. We can’t ignore this data. Something needs to be done!”



The man seated at the far end of the table spoke up, his tone cautious. “They aren’t harming us. Do we really want to dabble in something like this? Those things have coexisted with humanity as far back as our records go. They only affect a small group of people, and they never hurt anyone. Let’s not stir the pot. Especially not a pot with murky water when we have no idea how deep it goes.”



At the far end of the table, the youngest of the group finally broke his silence. He sat upright, fingers steepled, eyes reflecting the faint blue light. “If these things are real,” he said, “we need a way to defend against them.”



He glanced around the table, searching their faces for any sign of doubt. “We’ve paid for ignorance before, thinking we were untouchable, that nothing outside our understanding could ever reach us. Humanity nearly didn’t survive that lesson. That’s why we’re here now.”



He let his hand rest, steady, against the mahogany. “It’s our duty to protect every last Human. Monster, alien, ghost, demon… it doesn’t matter what shape the threat takes.”



The blue glow flickered in his eyes. “We have proof now. Doesn’t matter whether it fits into our understanding of science or the supernatural. If it’s real, we have to act.”



He leaned back and gave a small nod to the man at the display. “I called in a favor from Karin. She has a research division that deals with the… unusual. They’re equipped for this kind of thing.”



On cue, the screens shifted. Surveillance footage revealed a young woman waiting in the lobby, messy hair tucked under a hoodie, earphones clamped over her ears. She looked half-asleep, half-alert, surrounded by a ring of sleek security robots.



The youngest man’s lips curled into a thin smile. “Karin’s lent us someone from the Esoteric Research Division. Her name is Elis.”



He watched the girl on the screen, then looked back at the others. “She’s our first step.”



“Esoteric Research Division,” the eldest director mused, his tone dry. “Are they really going to loan out an immortal asset? I guess they really are taking this seriously.”



“She’s not immortal. Just young.” The youngest director tapped the table, scanning a tablet. “Karin gave me some background so we know how to navigate around the rough edges.”



“Rough edges? That doesn't sound good.” one of the men asked, an eyebrow raised. “What’s this Esoteric Research Division really about?”



""They are a special division of Karin's private research organization. They fall directly under the founders of Hatnode. Mostly Tier 8 classified,” the youngest replied.



""And what can you tell us about Elis herself?"" he asked.



“I can’t share much. But here’s what I know: her father was one of the founders of the Division. Her track record is… almost entirely classified, meaning most of what she’s done has been by direct order from the founders, just like this time. But… she was involved in developing the world’s Dimensional Protection System, the DPS. She’s also considered a protected asset. We’re to keep her alive, keep her fed. There’s a human guard watching her at all times, on top of the robot security. That’s on Karin’s recommendation, she told us to keep an eye on her at all times.”



“Why? Is she dangerous?” another voice asked, hesitant.



""I don't know…  But, she’s one of the very few cleared to research mind control, and other things even I don’t have access to. She might be dangerous with her words alone. So… just to be safe, If you talk to her, use the buddy system.”



A beat of silence passed around the table.



Finally, someone muttered, “What the hell did we get ourselves into?”



**--- Elis, five months later, Research Lab Server Room --**



The server room breathes around me. I've been awake for seventy-two hours and my eyelids twitch like dying relays.



I crouch barefoot on perforated tile. My coffee’s gone corpse-warm.



The dark does not mind. The code racing across three monitors does not care.



But the void cares: 1,024 EEG samples, four perfect seconds, missing from volunteer 47’s REM.



Silence so exact it feels stolen, a heartbeat lifted with surgical precision. My pulse speeds. I’ve seen every type of data corruption known to this field of science, but this feels deliberate. Personal. 



*Bet it’s them again.*



I brush hair out of my eyes, squinting at the waveform as if daring it to flinch.



Karin bankrolls this place with a blank check, military sensors, robots in every aisle, dimensional shielding, everything you can think of. 



It makes the darkness feel very safe. I’ve never liked bright server rooms, so I shut them all off. If I’m going to be stuck in this building, I might as well make it feel like home.



A human guard walks across the aisle and squints at me for a second, probably wondering if I should be here.



They leave. They don’t. I don’t care.



Only the LEDs pulse, slow, mechanical lungs sealed in metal ribs.



I replay the gap.



Quiet pushes against my eardrum as if it wants in. I smile. Coffee ripples; dust vibrates.



I can feel it.



A single black seed. Black. Breathing. *Am I losing my mind?*



Our machines still aren’t great at picking up the presence of fringe entities. I’ve come to realize my instinct is always much more accurate.



Yeah. I can feel it in the data.



An urge to lick the open ports pools behind my teeth.



Constructs again. Father’s favorite obsession. He always warned me about dimensional fuckery splashing onto every aspect of reality, equations smuggled into ordinary data. 



But I’m the kind of girl who draws equations on her wrist. I won’t believe the dark until I see its math. I'm going to figure this out on my own.



I brace my toes on the epoxy; if it were soil I’d dig in.



LEDs quicken, inhale, exhale, like lungs urging me to finish a thought. 



What connects sleep paralysis, PTSD, and hallucinations?



They share something subtle, something dark: a presence that doesn't quite belong inside the mind. A whisper at the edges of awareness, a chill felt rather than seen.



Shadow people.



The Night Hag.



Nightmares that bleed into your room.



Figures camped on the margins of sight, gone the instant you look straight on. 



At first, they seem unrelated, disconnected fragments haunting scattered minds. But what if they're symptoms of something deeper?



Damaged minds become open doors.



Subject 47 was as damaged as they come.



A relay snaps; the lungs of the datacenter exhales warm air. 



Dad used to say trauma was fertile soil; I laughed.



What did he know of trauma beyond scribbles in notebooks? But now, standing barefoot among servers that hum like insects, my spine itches. I shift my loose shirt, adjusting it uselessly, unable to shake the feeling that i'm doing something catastrophic. 



Another relay. Another breath.



I pick at the skin beside my thumb. Somewhere in the dark, a server fan stutters. For a second, I swear I hear breathing that isn’t mine.



My father once warned me about these things: living data, parasites in the conceptual layer. He scribbled notes in his margins about ideas that spread through myths, nightmares whispered from one damaged mind to another. But he never faced them directly, he was always busy building something secretive for Hatnode. Weapons probably… or worse.



But I’m here. Alone with servers humming like insects, sifting sleep paralysis EEGs and cocaine-induced psychosis scans, wondering why every victim sees the same silhouette watching from doorways or corners of vision. Something neither solid nor imaginary, something murderously real, growing roots inside humans.



Another relay snaps. My pulse skips. The fan whispers again.



*Why?*



My watch vibrates.



\[SLEEP ALERT: 74 hours awake. Severe deprivation detected. Rest is recommended, Elis.\]



I laugh, sharp and humorless. I dismiss it.



Staying awake is part of the experiment. The longer I go, the clearer they become.

I rub my eyes. It all started when Karin came back, changed. She wouldn’t say what happened in that other world, just that something called the Entities was real, and we needed to be afraid. 

That fear built the division. My Father got dragged into it.

*He's a weird guy.* 



My father never left me at home, he brought me into the Esoteric Research Division like I was another briefcase. The company didn’t care. He asked for clearance and I got it, even as a kid. No oversight, not for us.



Somewhere, another relay *clicks*. I flinch, just a little.



I remember meetings that went on forever. Hushed arguments behind glass. The soft scrape of pen on forbidden files. They let me sit in the corner, headphones on, pretending not to listen. But I listened. I always listened. Whispers about Entities, about data twisting, about things pressing against the walls of reality.



I learned to read off declassified memos, to count using nervous laughter and the number of coffee cups on the table.



Osmosis. That’s how I became an expert.



*Another click.* I’m back in the server room, back in the dark.



For now, I’m just on loan to the Office of Neural Health while I figure this one out. They’ve been getting too many reports lately.



I'm tired…



My chin sinks; the code blurs to soft gray static. 



For an instant I’m certain I’ve shut my eyes, but across the aisle a silhouette is standing, tall as the racks, edges seething like heat-ripples.



\[ BING \]



I jerk upright, heartbeat slamming the inside of my skull; the figure is gone, fans wheeze back on, the data on the monitors snap into razor focus. The data on the screen was exactly what I expected, I found the source.



“I found it!”



I accidentally drop to the floor. 



My legs sprawl, bare skin numb on the cold tile.



On the monitor: there it is. A sliver of brain tissue, hiding in plain sight, existing in every subject who’s seen the shadows. The perfect pocket. A nest for something to crawl into.



My heart stutters, “I… knew it.""



The thing was a fucking memetic virus, threading through trauma, putting down roots. Shadow people, leaping from mind to mind, no, from wound to wound.



My breath fogs on the screen.



All this time, it was just a node. A door.



Small, but enough.



I smile, counting the beats of my pulse, waiting for the darkness to notice I’ve seen it.



*You can't hide from me.*



I need to cut it out if that pocket’s the entryway.



""Let’s see what slamming the door does.""



I queue the brain surgery bots.    


In the monitor glass I catch my own reflection… pupils wide, *black.*

I've heard a lot about Quick Brown Fox's coffee from this sub and friends. Coincidentally, a friend of mine is flying down from Delhi. He's traveling this weekend (Aug 9). I wanted to ask him to get me a bag of QBF beans, but I am unsure of which blend and roast I should ask for. And that's where I could use some guidance.

For context: I generally take my coffee hot, with dark and light roast beans, using a Moka Pot and Pourover. I've tried Subko's Paderu roast and loved it.

Suggestions are much appreciated!

1mhz21l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mhz21l/a_dead_man_walks_my_neighborhood_every_night_no/,A dead man walks my neighborhood every night. No one else can see him.,"I was on the far side of my neighborhood when I saw him for the first time. The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts; that was the first thing I noticed about him. We walked toward each other, me crossing the street as an SUV slowly approached.

I was looking at the ground, but when he walked past me I felt a surge of heat, like an oven door had just opened. With it came a fetid air like that of burnt plastic. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street; that’s when I noticed the second thing.

The SUV came to a rolling stop at the stop sign. I screamed out and threw my hands in the air as I ran toward them, but the car passed right through the man as if he wasn’t there. He continued to walk with his eyes forward. It was only then, looking at him closely, that I noticed the third thing: he was translucent, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out the dark shadow of a house.

I watched him until he turned the corner. Then I ran home, looking over my shoulder every so often to make sure the ghost wasn’t following me.

At the time, my life was purgatory. I was 22 and had just graduated college. I was living with my parents and hadn’t found a “real” job yet. I worked about 20 hours a week at a local grocery store and spent the rest of my time applying for jobs.

I had this constant urge to do something crazy: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while I worked on my screenplays. Maybe I could sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van. I wanted something new and exciting. I didn’t care if the new and exciting was a *bad* new and exciting. 

I guess that’s why I went back to the street where I first saw the ghost.

He wasn’t there the first few times I went, but I could always smell him, that pungently sour burnt smell, sometimes more fresh than others. It became a routine; I felt like a paranormal investigator.

One Sunday evening, walking about twenty feet behind a couple pushing a baby in a stroller, there he was, walking towards us. Same t-shirt, same shorts. I stopped where I was and just watched. 

Neither he nor the family gave any indication that they saw each other. The ghost walked with its eyes resolutely forward, the mom and dad continued their conversation. And then the ghost walked through them.

I found myself biting my thumb as he approached me. My heart was hammering so loud that I barely heard the next car driving by. But I was determined to hold my ground. If there was a chance to experience something new I wanted to face it. There had to be a reason why only I could see him.

The heat and smell consumed me as he walked by. I became incredibly dizzy; I saw stars. 

Then he was walking past me. I followed.

The walk didn’t last much longer, less than five minutes. We turned a corner, he walked toward the first house on the right, then disappeared as he entered the front yard.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man roughly my age. He was looking down at me and smiling like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A little kid who just solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school yet.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, didn’t you?”

I nodded.

“That’s how I found him too. He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know. Like I said, I found him the same way. You wanna get a cup of coffee?”

I was so taken aback that I laughed. He flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” He asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me. And maybe you can tell me more about you.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. Either way, 15 minutes later we had our drinks and were sitting down outside a local coffee shop.

“So, how often do you see ghosts?” He asked.

“Not often,” I said. I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time. I wanted to seem cooler than I really was, like we were both a part of this selective club.

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink. 

I learned that his old house was across the street from where we’d seen the ghost, but now he lived in his own apartment in the city. He just liked to watch the man sometimes. He said it was the only ghost he’d ever seen that never left.

After that day we started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get coffee, other times it was dinner, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first coffee date. To some degree I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation; he hid it well, but I could tell that he was always holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. I felt bad for him.

Most importantly, he was my key to the world’s secrets.

So when one day he asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be closer to him. Not sex, although that wasn’t something I was opposed to; I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, what kind of shampoo he used, I wanted to *know* him, and you can’t know someone unless you know how they live when they’re alone.

So we went to his apartment. He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes. 

He showed me to his room: a bed, a desk, and a computer.

“You sure know how to live.”

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible.”

It didn’t make a lot of sense to me at first. I mean, was being outside inherently better than being inside? Over time I’ve realized that what he really cared about was having a reason for everything he did. He never wanted to go to bed feeling like he wasted his day, and he didn’t want to die feeling like he wasted his life. He didn’t mind being home if he was home for a reason: to write because that’s where his desk was, to sleep because that’s where his bed was, but he never wanted to waste time. That’s what was important.

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me.

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, wait a few seconds, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made me just do it. I wanted to make him happy. There was just something so sad about him.

I gave him about fifteen seconds. There weren’t a lot of places to hide inside the apartment, but it took me a long time to find him because I was walking so slowly. I thought he was planning to jump out and scare me.

I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. I opened the towel closet half joking, but found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. When I reached for him he straightened his legs and scooted out. He stood up and I kissed him.

It wasn’t exactly how I expected our first time to go, but yes, that was it. For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd make love. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either, and it made him happy, so I did it.

We were lying in his bed one night, no hiding and no seeking, my head on his chest, when he told me everything.

He saw a ghost for the first time while he was playing in his backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog which had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he saw a grey man in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she was smarter about how she dished them out. She hit him in places where no one could see the evidence: his chest and his back. She thought she could beat the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her over an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said. “Part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

“How’d she die?”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar. She found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch away he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her no.

When she tried to hit him with the other hand he caught that one too. He let go and she tried to hit him again and again, but each time he caught her arm. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he that found her, dead in her bed, with another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he said.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down it went swiftly through him like a knife slicing a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“*You’re* a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window one last time, he saw her, searching for him.

“I think it has something to do with trauma,” he said. “Or purpose. Sometimes I think they’re the same thing. I was her trauma, and her purpose was to stop me. She thought beating me could stop me. And when she couldn’t beat me anymore… she had no purpose. She’s stuck living in a world where she’s always trying to find me, even when I’m not there.”

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and I looked for him harder than ever.

The next day we went to see the ghost again. 

“Why do you think he’s still here?” I asked.

“Trauma, I guess.”

“And how come I can see him?”

“You’re probably connected somehow. You seem them more strongly when you are.”

We watched him for hours until he disappeared. I’ve always wondered where he goes when he’s not there. Is he stuck somewhere in between our world and elsewhere? Does he choose to come back, or is he forced to?

Over time I began to feel strange and guilty about our hide-and-seek. Was I helping him heal him from his trauma, or forcing him to stay in it? 

I drifted away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day, to hanging out once a week. He tried to reach out, but I always had some reason why I couldn’t come over. Once a week turned to every other week. Then we were just texting every so often.

At some point we became strangers. 

I found a job as a tutor. It was full-time and I found myself enjoying the work, looking forward to sessions, and feeling as though I *did* have a purpose: helping these kids get into college. Life was good; I didn’t need to chase something extreme to feel like I was living.

But like most experiences, once I settled into normalcy, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. There wasn’t a point in what I was doing. These kids were all rich, and with their parents’ money they were going to be fine without my help anyway. I was just another servant to make their lives easier. In the same way that they could clean their houses without maids, they could study without a tutor. It would just take effort.

When I got bored I started reaching out again. I texted him a few times and he didn’t answer, but I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two months later and I’d never replied.

I went to the street to watch the ghost again. I wondered what his trauma was. After a while, it felt like watching the Northern Lights must after enough time. It was cool and all, but, if I couldn’t be a part of it, what was the point? I wanted to live excitement, I didn’t just want to watch.

I got in my car and drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, but when he didn’t answer I went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. As ashamed as I am to admit it, I started to get angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement, my joy.

There was only one of him. I couldn’t just go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for three hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name a couple of times. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. After a moment I realized that he *was* sinking into it. The body in the tub was his ghost.

“Oh God,” I cried.

He looked up at me and smiled. “You found me.”

“What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

“You were using me.”

I paused for a second, tried to think of a response, then gave in, crying. “Yes, I was. But I still care. I’m sorry.”

He didn’t respond, just stayed curled in a ball.

“Why are you still here? Why can’t you move on?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t respond for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“There’s a door. But I don’t know what’s on the other side.”

“You need to go. You don’t want to be stuck here forever.”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

There was nothing to say; it was too late. I left.

It’s really long, 8 hrs a day doing emotional labor (I work with 3 year olds at a day camp) for 5 days a week. After work, I come home really drained so I spend time in my room.

Now, I don’t spend time in my room all day. I get out, say hi, talk to my parents, etc etc. But my mom really hates it when I spend any time at all in my room. I like my room, I have my own tv, the beds comfy, I like my privacy, it’s nice. But my mom hates that. She wants me to spend all my time with her. I tried to do that, but every time I do so, she’s always either criticizing what I did in the past or pushing me to contact my other family members (my cousins that are closer in age with me so that I could hang out). I do text and call them, but they never respond, they never call back, and after a while, I just stopped… But my mom thinks that I shouldn’t have stopped, that I should be the only one who’s putting work in. 

And i don’t get why she’s so confused to why I don’t like spending time with her. We went out a few days ago (like around 2pm), we were in a place that we don’t normally visit, and I wanted to go to a restaurant just to try out some of the food there. 

Then she goes “why is it that when we always go out, you always mention food.” I asked her what she meant by that and she goes “well, don’t you wanna see the scenery? Don’t you wanna do something else other than eat all the time.” And that just. Deflated me a bit. I don’t think I always ask for food. I was just feeling a bit hungry. But she discouraged me and instead we went to a cheap Pizzaria where we got a slice of awful pizza for 3 dollars cause she wanted to save money I guess. I don’t know, she always made comments about my weight after I gained a couple pounds after college. Mind you, I’m still fairly skinny and I’m at a healthy BMI, I’m just a bit chubbier than I was before. 
 
I started to exercise to lose that weight, but then she gets mad at that because the exercise machine is downstairs. Away from her. And then she guilt trips me because I’m exercising???

Idk, maybe she’s right in that I am a bit more introverted than I normally was. But that’s only because I have major anxiety about everything and she doesn’t take that seriously, at all. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD (secretly cause my uni does have a therapist) and my mom doesn’t believe in any of that. I tried to gently explain to her that I might have anxiety, that I might have these symptoms, and i suggested therapy and she immediately shut that down. She said that she “doesn’t believe in therapy” and that people who get therapy only do so to “get drugged and be in ooo la la land”.

But then she goes, “if you really want therapy, then we can go talk to someone. But I just don’t get why you can’t talk to me. Your own mother.” Then she guilt trips me into not going to therapy.

It’s so frustrating being with her. Like I would be talking and she would exaggerate my voice and my mannerisms just to critique whatever I’m saying (like that one Sponegbob chicken meme). She exaggerates and dramatizes everything that I say or do.

She was mad at me for staying at my room, rants about it to me, guilt trips me, and then says “I see you and you just wanna rip my face off—“ and I’m like??? No?? I’m frustrated yes but??? So we got in an argument about that. When I mentioned that she always over exaggerated my speech, suddenly, she can’t remember.

And I can’t help but if she’s right on a few things. Like I am an adult, maybe I should spend as much time as I can before I leave to uni again. And that I do have trouble cleaning my rooms (I keep forgetting to bring coffee mugs upstairs. I would see the mug on my little table. But I just can’t bring it up to the sink. It’s so simple to do what’s wrong with me) Maybe I do have some other things that need correcting, maybe I over share, maybe I’m too introverted, maybe I should just try harder.

Idk. It’s frustrating. ",1,1754365991.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

Or am I on to something?,"I am in the process of starting a business, but have faced considerable skepticism from those around me. I am passionate about board games; however, it has been challenging as most of my friends do not share this interest. Furthermore, investing in new board games is difficult to justify given their high cost and limited information available prior to purchase. 

To address these challenges, I devised a business concept: a retail store where customers can not only purchase board games, but also try them out in-store before committing to a purchase, rent games, participate in gaming events, and connect with others who share similar interests. Additionally, the store would offer opportunities to learn skills such as miniature painting and host trading card game (TCG) and video game competitions. 

Despite my enthusiasm, when I presented this idea to the local small business department, it was met with dismissal. The feedback primarily focused on encouraging me to join paid networking events or to pivot towards a coffee shop or bar model, which they indicated would improve my chances of receiving a grant. My friends have also expressed doubt, suggesting people are unlikely to buy or play board games, and have instead encouraged me to create a bar that caters more to their preferences.

After a recent kitchen reno I have installed a brondell under the sink water filter solution and it is my go to in for filtered water in the morning and what goes into my kettle. Now the system removes contaminants and does carbon filtering…but really doesn’t mess with the TDS. Overall it has a very slight after taste to it (compared to something like zero water) which I want to say are reminants of the process and some of the dissolved solids still present.

Hear me my other fellows that have gone down this rabbit hole and have a similar under the sink setup…I am pushing where I can go with light roasts this summer and I figure it was time to pick up some Third Wave Water to trial and see if it can improve what I am tasting.

Has someone gone done this path far enough to pass along some lessons learned?

Can I get away with jugs of water from this “filtered tap” or should I spend the few dollars on a gallon bottle of distilled water to REALLY “get” what TWW is all about?

Note: I get decent brews overall - but let’s say I think that I am somewhere in the range of getting 75-80% of what I think I can get from my current setup…

Here’s what actually works.,"I have been seeing a lot of questions lately coming from different sites and boards. Coming recently from this industry, locally, I would like to share the hard truths and the tips as well.

There’s opportunity *everywhere* in D.C.—nonprofits, lobbying firms, federal contractors, gov agencies, startups—you name it. Competition is brutal. Everyone here has a stacked resume and Type-A energy. Took me a while, but I’ve actually managed to land unicorn jobs in this town, so thought I’d share.

**1. It’s not just about skills. People here want to know why and if you care.** Especially if you’re looking at nonprofits, policy orgs, education, or development work, you can’t fake it. They don’t want a generic cover letter. They want to see that you actually give a damn about what *they* do. Don’t just say “I’m passionate about nonprofit work.” Say *why.* Pick something that org works on and show how it relates to you - make it personal, not copied and pasted.

**2. Job boards are lame.** Sure, apply online. But that ain’t how most people get hired. You’re going to have to WORK IT for referrals, connections, coffee chats, random convos at happy hours—that’s the secret sauce. D.C. is weirdly small: someone will know someone.

BUT - temp or staffing agencies can save you a lot of work. It’s their job to get people jobs. A lot of them have solid ties to law firms, nonprofits, and trade associations. [Temp gigs](https://whitmanjobs.com/2022/08/when-to-consider-temporary-work-6/) (recommended) can turn into full-time positions—or at least pay the rent while you’re looking.

**3. Your resume needs to “speak D.C.”** If you’re coming from another city or industry, you’re going to need to translate your experience into D.C. sector lingo. Make sure you’re using the right terms. A little snooping at other people’s resumes or job descriptions can be really helpful.

**4. The hiring process is...a mess.** Don’t expect things to move fast—or logically. You might hear nothing for three weeks, then suddenly get an interview. Or you’ll do four interviews, and the offer gets delayed because someone’s waiting on a budget. It’s frustrating, but it’s pretty normal here.

Don’t wait around for *one* job to pan out - you’ll end up on the street. Keep applying, keep networking, and don’t assume silence = rejection. It might just mean “gov’t limbo.”

1mhyw7t,https://i.redd.it/03wvjma804hf1.png,Finished a Jason-a-thon recently and wanted to share my tier list,"I'm aware that there are plenty of these topics around here, but what the hell, I figured I should try it as well. I'll write my brief opinions on each movie as well…

  
**S TIER**

Part 2: To me, this is peak Friday. The characters are very likeable, the final girl is the smartest of the series (I really like that they mention a bunch of times that Ginny is going to be a psychologist, and she uses that to survive Jason), Jason himself is at his best, being agile and aggressive, the kills are great, and I always dug his costume for this movie. The only part of the movie that I hate is the prologue. Not only I dislike Alice's death, but imagining Jason roaming around with a sack on his head going back to Crystal Lake with Alice's corpse, and no one calling the cops, is really weird.

Part 4: I think part 4 has the best ensemble of characters. From the epic dancing of Crispin Glover to Corey Feldman (to this day it's still odd to think that the kid from Goonies, Gremlins, Stand By Me and so many famous 80s movies, is in a Friday the 13th flick — well, technically two). Also, “deadfuck” became one of my favorite swearings. And while I loved Jason's costume in 2, Part 4 has, hands down, the best Jason. The ending with his head sliding down the machete is just great. The one thing I would change in that movie was Rob's fate. I think he deserved to live and avenge his sister. Also, justice for bananagirl (more on that later).

**A TIER**

Part 1: I like the first movie very much, but the reason I'm placing it below 2 and 4 is because it sometimes can be a real slogfest. I mean, the coffee scene is legend. I do enjoy the ""whodunnit"" aspect of the movie, but I think that once you know the killer's identity, the rewatches will never be the same, and that kinda hurts the movie's replayability. The movie also is weird in a sense that it tries to make the characters deep, but then it changes its mind, and just disposes of them. A scene that comes to mind is when Marcie tells Jack about the dream she had about a blood rain, and it feels so out of place, because you think you're going to  get some connection with that girl and learn more about her, but just a few minutes later, she gets, literally, axed off. Finally, like many people have remarked, I think it was a missed opportunity to make Brenda the final girl, not Alice.

Part 3: This movie has, in my opinion, the cutest final girl of the franchise, and one of the best too. But the whole rapey-Jason element was too out of place. I understand they were still trying to figure out the character, but it's still weird to rewatch this movie and see that scene. The characters — except, maybe, for the hippy couple — are also very likeable, even poor Shelly, and they behave like real people (Vera dismissing Shelly and then feeling some remorse made me feel bad for her death). Andy's death is still one of the greatest.

Part 6: At this point, Jason was zombified and Paramount knew better than to take itself seriously. Tom McLoughlin's directing is amazing. Having Tommy Jarvis as an actual hero with a plan instead of a confused, psychologically tortured dude was much better. The main reason I like this movie is the humor. The little kid asking, “So, What WERE you gonna be when you grew up?” still cracks me up. There are so many great and funny scenes in this movie, and one could think that this could go against the horror aspect of it all, but, like I said, you're doing the 6th part of a horror franchise that requires you to turn your brain off. At this point, to take itself too seriously would be a grave mistake (more on that later).

**TIER B**

Jason X: Another great example of a Friday movie that didn't take itself seriously and just went for the absurd with no shame at all. And let's be real, putting Jason in space, as absurd as it is, is an interesting concept. Upon rewatching this one last week, I was surprised at how well made it is. The set design is incredible, Uber Jason is awesome, and the effects are not so bad for that time. I admit that the cast of characters is probably the worst in the series, but I like Kay-Em, and I think the pervert teacher is funny whenever he's onscreen. The kills are interesting, and I like how it pays homage to the series here and there.

Freddy Vs. Jason: You would think that bringing together the two titans of slasher movies would be an easy S Tier, but here we are. The premise is intriguing. Freddy using Jason to make people afraid of him again is clever, I admit, but most of the cast, again, is very poor. Also, no Kane Hodder? Fuck off, mate. Some of the plot is stupid as heck. Having Jason (whom we saw dive underwater several times) be afraid of water, and Freddy (who was really pleased when fire was surrounding him and his victims in the pool party scene in Nightmare 2) be afraid of fire has got to be one of the most dumb things these franchises have ever done.

Part 7: I have to admit, I don't like this movie very much. But me not liking it doesn't mean it's a bad movie, and I can recognize that. It still follows the formula, it still has a decent cast of characters, good kills and Kane's debut. The ""Carrie"" aspect of it all? I was never a fan of it, but it does help make things interesting. I reckon this movie suffered a lot with the censorship, which is a shame. The kills could have salvaged this one for me. Also, the ending with the dad was laughably stupid.

Remake: Yeah, I remember the early 2000s, when every single horror franchise was getting remade. Fortunately, I don't think this one is too horrible. I think it was an interesting idea to mash the first 3 movies into one, and I actually felt bad for some characters dying. Once again we have that Jason from Part 2, who is agile and aggressive, and while some didn't like that — which is fair — I kinda dug it.

**TIER C**

Part 8: Now, doing a reverse of what I did with Part 7, I have to place Part 8 lower, although I simply love this one. Once again, I have to be fair, and in the great scheme of things, it's not very good. But I hold it in a special place in my heart, it was one of the first Fridays that I watched when I was a kid, far from my mom's eyes. Yes, I know that it was a cheap shot to promote NY like that and not showing it very much, but I do believe that if it wasn't for that, this one would be much more well regarded by the fans. The premise of Jason stalking people on a ship is not bad — and a better version of that was Jason X. But, you know, to me, this is the Friday that screams “I'm from the 80s” the most. The soundtrack, the vibe, the settings, it's all there. The evil uncle Charles is still my favorite human antagonist, he's both despicable and hilarious (his surprised “Hey, what do you think you're doing? I mean… Now, you stop that! I mean, really…” to Tamara is never not going to be funny).

Part 5: In Part 5's defense, it was really trying to hint to the audience (with the blue mask and all) that that was not Jason, and that that was a new whodunnit Friday, which was fine by me. However, making Tommy Jarvis that miserable was always a bad move to me, and the killer's motivation is simply hilariously bad. I mean, let's take a closer look: Roy, the paramedic, goes nuts upon seeing his son's murdered corpse (a son he abandoned, by the way). Next thing we know, he's killing everything that breathes, from closeted greasers who had nothing to do with anything, to a pervert watching two teens having sex, and another guy in the middle of a diarrhea. Doesn't matter, you live around there? You're dead. Seems like good old Roy took a page out of Jason's notebook on how to kill people who are not even involved in the whole thing — justice for bananagirl part 2. But the funniest thing in all of this killfest is that Roy, after cutting the population of Crystal Lake by half (I know, it's just a joke) doesn't kill THE. ONE. GUY. who was responsible for his kid's death. Vic was his name, right? Yeah, the last we see him he was being taken away by the cops, and canonically speaking, if we never saw him dying, he's still alive! I mean, what the shit? Anyway, despite the interesting aspect of the “whoddunit” returning, it was awfully executed, and when the best thing about your movie are Debisue Voorhees' breasts, you know it sucks.

**TIER D**

Hell: And here it is. The lowest point of the franchise that ironically sent it to hell for a very long time. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that could possibly redeem it. The attempt on making Friday more like Halloween by giving it more lore and revealing that Jason actually had a sister was dumb as fuck. The protagonist, despite being funny sometimes, is very weak (and Jason tossing him all around instead of simply killing him still makes my eyes roll). The most appealing character is the bounty hunter, but not even him is able to save this pile of vomit. And what a good decision that was, let's just have Jason physically at the beginning and at the end of the movie. That will make the fans happy, right? And look at that! Rapey-Jason has made a comeback by invading a woman's vagina, this time as a hellworm. Success. Ok, I admit that the chick getting split in half and the obnoxious diner owner getting a literal “shut up” from Jason are good kills, but again, it's not enough to save it. It's amazing that even the bad movies of the franchise carry some substantial positives here and there, but this one? Nothing. Its gravest mistake was to take itself too seriously, especially with all the lore and the story. The director, apparently fresh out of college, should have come down from his high horse and rewatch Part 6. This was the last time that I ever saw this movie in my whole life… I hope.

Anyway, that's it, I tried to make it brief, but it seems I got carried away by some of those movies. I still hope it was a good read to you.",6,1754365648.0,fridaythe13th,2,1.0,False

1mhyutm,https://searchspot.ai,I Built an AI That Plans Better Trips Than Travel Agents (And It’s Free)🤯,"
**TL;DR: Created SearchSpot.ai after getting scammed by a “5-star” hotel that had bedbugs. Now it searches ALL reviews across social platforms, compares every hotel option, and builds perfect itineraries with safety tips and weather data. Just saved my friend $800 on her Japan trip.**

-----

So this happened last month in Bali…

I’m standing in what TripAdvisor called a “luxury beachfront resort” (4.8 stars, 2,000+ reviews) and there are literally **cockroaches** running across the bathroom floor. The “ocean view” was a construction site. The “complimentary breakfast” was stale bread and instant coffee.

But here’s the kicker - when I checked Instagram and TikTok later, I found HUNDREDS of posts showing the real place. People were posting about the bugs, the noise, the scams. But none of this showed up on traditional booking sites.

That’s when I realized: **We’re making million-dollar travel decisions based on curated, manipulated data.**

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

- Booking sites show you what THEY want you to see
- Travel agents work on commission (guess where their loyalty lies?)
- Google reviews can be bought
- Social media has the REAL stories, but who has time to search through TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter for every hotel?

## So I Built Something Different

**SearchSpot.ai** doesn’t just search hotel websites. It:

✅ **Scrapes real reviews** from Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Twitter
✅ **Compares EVERY option** (not just sponsored ones)  
✅ **Builds custom itineraries** based on your actual budget
✅ **Includes safety warnings** locals actually post about
✅ **Real-time weather integration** (no more “sunny” forecasts that are 2 weeks old)
✅ **Coordinate-based search** (finds hidden gems near your location)

## Real Results That Blew My Mind

**Friend’s Japan Trip:**

- Original plan from travel agent: $3,200
- SearchSpot.ai plan with BETTER hotels: $2,400
- **Saved: $800**

**My Thailand Trip:**

- Found a local family restaurant (from a Thai TikToker’s post) that wasn’t on ANY travel site
- Avoided a “must-visit” temple that locals on Reddit said was a tourist trap
- Discovered a beach that Instagram influencers keep secret

## The Craziest Feature

It found a hotel in Prague that had **perfect reviews on Booking.com** but locals on Reddit were posting about it being a front for credit card scams. SearchSpot caught this and recommended a family-run place that wasn’t even on major booking sites.

**The family place was half the price and 10x better.**

## Why I’m Sharing This

Because I’m tired of:

- Travel companies profiting off our ignorance
- Influencers promoting places they’ve never been to
- People spending their hard-earned money on trips that suck

## Try It Yourself

Go to **searchspot.ai** and put in any destination you’re planning. Watch it pull up stuff you’d NEVER find on Expedia or with a travel agent.

**Warning:** You might get addicted to planning trips you can’t afford yet 😅

For the longest time I thought it was just some hacker tool or something you only needed if you were doing shady stuff online. Turns out it’s actually pretty simple and useful for everyday people too.

A VPN or Virtual Private Network basically hides your internet activity. When you turn it on it routes your connection through a private server somewhere else so websites can’t see your real IP address or location. It’s kind of like wearing a mask online. Instead of your internet traffic going straight from your device to a website it first goes through a VPN server which adds a layer of privacy.

People use it for different reasons. Some just want to stay more private especially on public WiFi like in coffee shops or airports. Others use it to get around location blocks on streaming services or websites that are restricted in their country. It’s also a way to stop websites and advertisers from tracking everything you do.

So yeah you don’t have to be super techy to use a VPN. Most apps make it easy – just open it and hit connect. If you care even a little bit about online privacy or want access to stuff outside your region it’s worth checking out.",1,1754365349.0,VPN_Question,0,1.0,False

1mhyqi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mhyqi2/girl_im_crushing_on/,Girl I'm Crushing On,"So there is this girl at a local coffee shop I visit frequently. I have a major issue with getting nervous around girls, especially when I am attracted to them. I can have all the confidence in the world, but as soon as it comes time to spark that conversation I get a wave of anxiety, and then just end up acting disinterested.

Anyway when I first saw this girl, I thought she was cute. Really friendly. But I was actually kind of talking to another girl at the time, so I didn't really think past the ""she's kinda cute"" at the time. Since then things have fallen through with the other one, and I have a weird feeling there could be mutual attraction with the new girl, but I am way too nervous to make that move.

I need the ladies to help me out a bit here haha. So 1 day about a month ago, I went through the drive through, and I intended on asking her out if she was the one waiting on me. Sure enough she was. Wasn't busy. Would have been the perfect opportunity, but I got that wave of anxiety, and I think it was obvious in our interaction lol. The thing is I felt like there was nervous energy from her too. Which kinda had me thinking maybe she likes me too? Naw im just delusional.. Next day shes working, and I went in to order. She wasn't working the cash for the 3 ahead of me, and when I got up to order it seemed like she went out of her way to wait on me and approached me with a big smile that seemed to be out of the ordinary. Like not the same as previous encounters. Again, instead of making some kind of move, my anxiety gets the best of me, and I fail to make that move. Instead acting as if I have no idea shes interested, and probably giving off vibes that im not either. So that was a fail.. Couple days later I went in, and when I was waiting for my drink she again seemed to go out of her way to get next to me cleaning out a machine, and went on to chat up a coworker in a joking manner. Almost felt to me like she was trying to show her playful personality to me, but idk if im just over analyzing things because im crushing on the girl haha.. Like im well aware how delusional dudes can be about girls liking them 😂.. I again let the anxiety get the best of me, and basically acted as if I wasn't even paying attention to her.

After that I wrote my number on a piece of paper to give to her. But every single time I get a chance since I chicken out.. Since that day though, I did notice her being a little less ""flirty"" each interaction after that. It's almost to the point now that it seems like normal customer interactions going on. Am I crazy to think this girl likes me but I have caused her to back off because I am giving off the vibe that I dont like her?

While it may be slightly more expensive than some generic alternatives, its seamless compatibility, NSF certification, and brand reputation make it a worthwhile investment for those who prioritize water quality and the longevity of their KitchenAid appliance. While other filters may offer additional certifications or a slightly longer lifespan, the KitchenAid filter's core strengths provide excellent value and peace of mind.

[$200-300],"I have been using an ancient Gaggia MDF for years with my Cafelat Robot. The grinder works fairly well, since the Robot is pretty forgiving and doesn't need the most finely-tuned grinds, but having more than 2-3 settings that work for espresso would be nice. Before the MDF, I used an even more ancient Super Jolly. It was obviously much nicer, especially for the more temperamental La Pavoni I used to have, but it was far too big for where I live, and grind adjustment could be tedious.

I usually pull shots with medium to dark roasts, and occasionally also use the grinder for cold brew and V60 pourover.

Since I have a gift card, I'm between two grinders sold by Williams Sonoma. The Encore ESP seems like the obvious choice. Parts on the Baratza grinders are supposed to be pretty easy to replace. 20 steps of espresso adjustment is a big improvement over 2, and the 20 steps for non-espresso coffee would make things easier for my occasional non-espresso coffees.

The Lelit Fred Tempo also seems like a good option, but I can't find much information on it. Lelit build quality is supposed to be excellent, and the Fred Tempo has fully stepless adjustment, which would be nice for espresso. I wouldn't mind holding onto my MDF for non-espresso coffees, though I'd prefer to have just the one grinder. The Lelit also has a timer, which would be helpful, but not an absolute necessity. The Encore ESP burrs are pretty well-reputed, but since there is less overall information on the Lelit, I don't really know how well it grinds.

I'm in the US, so parts availability might also be better with Baratza, since even though they're owned by Breville, they're still located here.

A third possibility would be waiting for the Encore ESP Pro, though I don't know if Williams Sonoma is planning to stock it. The timer and stepless adjustment seem like solid additions. Regardless, definitely want to stick to options sold by Williams Sonoma.

# Best Coffee Packs with Filter [2025 Review]

Coffee packs with filters, also known as coffee bags or single-serve coffee bags, are pre-portioned coffee grounds sealed inside a filter bag, similar to tea bags. They are designed for easy brewing, requiring only hot water and a mug. This innovative solution addresses the need for convenience and portability for coffee lovers, offering a quick and mess-free way to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of coffee anywhere.

Coffee packs with filters stand out in the market due to their simplicity and ease of use, appealing to busy individuals, travelers, and anyone seeking a no-fuss coffee experience. they provide a convenient alternative to customary coffee brewing methods like drip machines or French presses, making them ideal for those with limited time or access to equipment.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee packs with filters offer several noteworthy features that contribute to their overall quality and user experience.

**Pre-Portioned Coffee Grounds:** Each pack contains a precisely measured amount of coffee grounds,typically ranging from 8 to 12 grams,ensuring a consistent brew strength every time. This eliminates the need for measuring and reduces the risk of weak or overly strong coffee.The amount of coffee is carefully calibrated to deliver the optimal extraction for a single cup, considering the grind size and coffee type. This consistency is a major advantage for users who value predictable results.

**Integrated Filter Bag:** The coffee grounds are enclosed in a filter bag made of paper or biodegradable materials. The filter is designed to allow hot water to pass through efficiently, extracting the coffee's flavors while preventing grounds from escaping into the cup.

The filter's pore size is crucial,balancing the flow rate with filtration effectiveness. High-quality filters prevent sediment while allowing the full flavor profile of the coffee to be extracted.

**Nitrogen-Flushed packaging:** Many coffee packs are individually wrapped in nitrogen-flushed packaging to maintain freshness and prevent oxidation. This helps preserve the aroma and flavor of the coffee grounds until they are ready to be brewed.

Nitrogen, being an inert gas, displaces oxygen, preventing the coffee from going stale. This is especially meaningful for pre-ground coffee, which loses its freshness more quickly than whole beans.

**Variety of Coffee Blends and Roasts:** Top-rated coffee packs are available in a wide range of blends, roasts, and origins to cater to different taste preferences.From light and fruity blends to dark and bold roasts, there is a coffee pack to suit every palate.

The options often include single-origin coffees, decaffeinated versions, and flavored varieties. This diversity allows users to explore different coffee profiles and find their perfect cup.

**biodegradable and Compostable Options:** Environmentally conscious consumers can opt for coffee packs made with biodegradable or compostable filter bags and packaging. These options minimize environmental impact and contribute to enduring practices.

The materials used in these eco-friendly packs are designed to break down naturally after disposal, reducing landfill waste. This is a growing trend as consumers become more aware of the environmental consequences of single-use products.

## Core Benefits

**Unparalleled Convenience:** Coffee packs with filters offer ultimate convenience, allowing users to brew a fresh cup of coffee in minutes with minimal effort. simply place the pack in a mug, pour hot water, and steep for the recommended time.

This eliminates the need for measuring coffee grounds, cleaning brewing equipment, and dealing with messy coffee residue. This makes coffee packs ideal for busy mornings, travel, and situations where convenience is paramount.

**Portability and Travel-Friendliness:** The compact and lightweight design of coffee packs makes them highly portable and perfect for travel. They can easily be packed in a suitcase, backpack, or carry-on bag, allowing users to enjoy quality coffee wherever they go.

This is notably beneficial for camping, hiking, hotel stays, or any situation where access to traditional coffee brewing equipment is limited. Coffee packs ensure that a delicious cup of coffee is always within reach.**Consistent Brew Quality:** Pre-portioned coffee grounds and controlled filter design guarantee a consistent brew quality with every cup. This eliminates the guesswork and variability associated with traditional brewing methods.

This consistency is especially important for users who value predictable results and want to enjoy the same great-tasting coffee every time. Coffee packs provide a reliable and repeatable coffee brewing experience.

**Reduced Waste and Easy Cleanup:** Coffee packs minimize waste compared to traditional brewing methods, as there are no loose coffee grounds to dispose of. The used filter bag can simply be discarded or composted, making cleanup quick and easy.

This reduces the environmental impact and simplifies the coffee brewing process. Coffee packs are a convenient and eco-friendly option for coffee lovers.

## FAQs Section

**Are Coffee Packs with Filter as Good as Freshly Ground Coffee?**
While coffee packs offer convenience, freshly ground coffee generally provides a more vibrant and nuanced flavor profile.However,high-quality coffee packs use freshly roasted beans and nitrogen-flushed packaging to preserve freshness,resulting in a satisfying cup that approximates the taste of freshly brewed coffee. the difference is frequently enough subtle, making coffee packs a worthwhile trade-off for the added convenience.

**How Long Should I Steep My Coffee Pack for Optimal Results?**
The recommended steep time varies depending on the coffee pack and the desired strength. Generally,steeping for 3-5 minutes is recommended. Experiment with different steep times to find your preferred flavor intensity. Longer steeping times may result in a stronger and more bitter cup,while shorter times may produce a weaker brew.

**Can I Reuse a Coffee Pack with Filter?**
No, coffee packs with filters are designed for single use only. Reusing a coffee pack will result in a considerably weaker and less flavorful cup of coffee. The coffee grounds will have already been extracted during the first brew, and the filter may be compromised.

**Are Coffee Packs Environmentally Friendly?**
The environmental friendliness of coffee packs varies depending on the materials used. look for packs made with biodegradable or compostable filter bags and packaging to minimize environmental impact. some companies also offer recycling programs for their coffee packs. Always check the product details for specific information on sustainability.

So, something strange happened to me today and I wonder if anyone can shed some light on what I found. I drive a lot for work, small trucks delivering stuff between warehouses owned by my company but for the most part, I only drive within Ohio and occasionally over the state line to one of our branches in PA. But for the past week I’ve been driving cross country, how did this start? Well my boss I’ll call him B asked me if I would be willing to fly to New York and pick up a truck there and drive it to Seattle.


As weird as that probably sounds, B is a good guy, and a great boss so I agreed. I know him well enough to know it’s nothing illegal and he was offering to pay me double, plus expenses for every day I was on the road. I figured it would take around a week at most, plus he offered to give me the next week off so I gladly agreed. 



I got into NY around midnight and some guy met me with the truck I was to drive at the airport. I drove it to Philadelphia, called B to let him know how far I’d gotten, and then crashed at a cheap motel. Other than the innate oddness of the request nothing strange happened that night or for the next few after, until I reached Wisconsin. 



Has anyone ever heard of a town called Doveland? I just passed through, and I don’t think it was real. 


It was getting late and I was looking for a place to turn in for the night when I saw the turnoff sign for Doveland, the sign said there was a motel in town so I decided I had gone far enough and would try and get some sleep, but when I entered town it was… well it was strange is the only way I can really think to describe it.


I want you to do a little experiment for me, go on one of those AI image generators and give it a prompt like “generic small town american main street” see what it spits out? That is what this Doveland place was like. What I mean is that everything looked right at a distance but it gave off a really strange vibe, and when I got closer all the small details made no sense. For example, buildings would change material or architectural style seemingly at random, some of the doors had no handles, others too many, or in the wrong place, and weirdest of all, the signs were all nonsense. 


One building had a marquee like an old movie theater that said “Drug Storee”, weird spelling of Store aside that wasn’t that strange but as I got closer I saw smaller text underneath it that was unreadable, just jumbles of letters and numbers that vaguely resembled prices at a distance, same goes for everything in town. The gas station’s sign said “Gaz: 000 por leet” Or at least that’s what it looked like, all the letters were misshapen and oddly drawn, like the font they used was designed by an illiterate.



I tried to call B and let him know I was stopping for the night then, but instead of ringing or a “no signal” tone, I got elevator music like I was on hold. I tried again and the same thing happened, just bad jazz music. Out of curiosity, I tried a couple more numbers like my girlfriend and the pizza place near where I live, but nothing. Or rather, the same thing, just that music again. 



Things only got stranger as I drove through town, no people were out, I mean nobody! I didn’t see a single human being in town. And the few parked cars I passed were all old boxy sedans, they looked 80s vintage, but none of them had any badges or logos that I could see, and all the plates were blank white with black numbers, not real state plates. The numbers were weird too, just sequential digits in the same bizarre font, everyone I passed going higher. 01, 02, 03 like that. 



I never found the motel, I just kept driving until I got out of town then found my way back onto the interstate and kept going until I reached the next town. Some little place called Cottage where I am now. They had a little all-night diner and I’m sitting at a booth there writing this now, thing is when I asked the locals if they could tell me anything about Doveland the waitress nearly spilled a pot of coffee and several old timers gave me really strange looks, then they all started talking over each other assuring me that no such place existed. 
 

They know something, and I don’t think I’m welcome here anymore.

I guess I’m posting here tonight because it’s been a while since someone has been a part of my life. 3 years is long enough I feel, but also not wanting to rush into anything. 

Spent the last 2-3 years doing some needed healing and mentally decompressing, so I kindly ask that if you have healing to do please don’t get involved with me. 

A little about me:

Tall, tattooed and bearded ; full time job , night shifter. Coffee addict, professional couch potato. Italian food , and German food are best. 

Pretty quiet at times, but I do have some extrovert in me. Upon waking up I prefer not to have long conversations until I’ve had coffee and time to process being awake. 

My hobbies range from being outside , to napping , to watching hockey / football , to cooking , to riding a sxs. Music is a must , along with comedy shows and some crime shows. 


The things I look for in a relationship are very simple and mandatory : 

* healthy communication 
* trust
* Honesty 
* accountability 
* not being lazy 
* transparency on goals and expectations 
* intimacy , both in and out of bed

Probably one of the lowest maintenance people you’ll meet ; don’t lie, or cheat, or withhold information from me and we will be fine.  I have to be able to trust you 100%, or it won’t last. 

Do I have a type? Sort of, but that doesn’t mean that’s strictly what I go for. It goes as follows :

* somewhere between 4’11 - 5’6
* short to long dark hair, but red and blonde are fine too 
* tattoos , piercings , glasses 
* silly , caring , motivating , comforting 
* Hypersexual ( since that’s where my drive is ) 

There’s more to discuss, but I feel this is a good starting point. I have pics , and will share them upon messaging. 

Hope to hear from you

For context I'm 33m  and graduated from college in spring 2017.

One person on particular who I remember was a part of our group of friends from sophomore yr to about maybe junior year bc she didn't finish her degree at our university and I think she finished via community college. Well this girl at first we just thought was a pothead who had interesting conversations then as time went on it became noticeable how much of a parasite she was. 

She would always come hangout to get high with us, ask to borrow money (typically like a dollar or two), and sometimes even trade things for weed like coffee she'd get from her part-time barista job. I think she did oxy quite a bit too bc there were a few times she'd say it out loud. 

Anyway, she would say a lot of fucked up shit out loud, talk shit on others, get pissed if you said something to her that was just a joke or comeback, and overall just get irritated with just random interactions in our friend group. For example once she was nodding off in a commons area of our dormitory and she just got pissed at our friend who scared her. Another time at a friend's place not too far from campus I jokingly said to make me a sammich and she just said fuck you and some other things. 

It got to the point that some of our friends quit hanging around with her bc she would just be bumming drugs off us. There was one instant where we hadn't seen or heard from her from sometime and then two of our friends bumped into her in the downtown area of our city (she was attending community college at this point). Before she could say anything like oh hey how's it's going one of our buddies just say, I don't have any weed instantly. 

We had a laugh about it later bc of how it happened so fast. Anyway fast-forward maybe a year, she's still the same, dating some fuck boy still attended our university, and working part-time jobs while in community college. My sister just so happened to work with her at the same part time job but she didn't know we were related. 

One day my sister told me something personal about her family that she had said her at work (not in confidence, she just said it out loud to her and her fellow coworkers). Anyway to not go into too much detail, it was one those apple doesn't fall too far from the tree things. I told this to our friends and we laughed so hard. 

I would go later on to post the story on a social media app at the time, I think it was yik yak back when it was at its peak. I didn't mention names and just kept it vague. Anyway I tell one of our mutual friends he tells her and I'm made out to be the bad guy. And I just laugh bc she would always talk so much shit on others and say see some horrendous things in general, she could dish it out but couldn't take it.

Anyway nothing ever came of it and I think one of her friends tried telling me some shit once shortly after but I just told her to fuck off. 

im no saint by any means but I don't deal with bs from others who are clearly hypocrites, I just wanted to get that off my chest and will probs post more from my college days. ",1,1754363741.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1mhy7jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mhy7jq/second_setup_still_new/,"Second Setup, Still NEW","Hey everybody! Just introducing myself, my setup, and what I've made and what I think tastes alright! I'll be looking more into recipes and setups here in the thread.

All of your setups are impressive, and I'd like to add more to mine!

I usually drink 3 or 4 double shots a day. I'll have to add some photos of my ""cortado"" to be judged. 

I started with a walmart single serve deal, with the mini pot that it brewed into. It took a lot to get something that was ""good"" coming from someone who never made espresso. I would grind the beans fresh and only use purified drinking water.

Now I have this Mirox brand machine. It's a significant upgrade, and it makes something that I'd be comfortable calling an espresso. I set the grind to 8, on a scale of 1 to 14 or 16, I can't recall off hand. I assume that's also relative to the machine. Got this cool kit off of Amazon that includes the stabby needle thing to break up chunks, a tamp, and a brush. It came with more, but I really only use these items.

I live in Phoenix, so my favorite spot to get beans is from ""Press Coffee"". They import their beans, and have a roastery in Scottsdale. I also like that they stamp the roast date on the bag. I've been using their Sumatran recently.

I usually make my version of a ""cortado"" like this:

* 2 shot from machine (2.5oz liquid volume)
* 1oz of extra extra Dunkin brand cream (since its cream and not palm oil) steamed to be like 3oz, but I add probably 2oz or so

I'll make a latte like this:

* 2 shot from machine (2.5oz liquid volume)
* 1 ice cube
* 2oz extra extra Dunkin sweet cream
* 4oz milk

1mhy79n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mhy79n/made_a_decisionmistake_that_became_exaggerated/,Made A Decision/Mistake That Became Exaggerated,"I (M25) was broken up with by my (F24) girlfriend about 7 weeks ago. We had been dating for 3 years and had a very supportive loving relationship. We were best friends and even while having to do some long distance while I was at school, were super communicative and supportive every day. Type of relationship where we just knew we wanted to be married one day and it was easy loving each other. We also lived together for a year when I was at school just so she could be with me.

Anyways, I could get caught up in talking about how good it was but I ruined it. We had planned a 4 month trip over seas to celebrate being done long distance and my graduation. 2 weeks before we leave she randomly gets some message from a girl claiming I cheated on her (kissing other girls at a party) 2.5 years ago. I had no idea who this person was but turns out she was at this party that was hosted by my team. This was also hosted at my house I had a bunch of roomates. Everyone knew I was happily and proudly in my relationship. I did everything to try and bring light to this, from calling all my teammates asking for any details on that night or anything that could clear this up. She had no real proof other than she was there that night and from the information I gathered she was actually kicked out of the party for fighting with the girlfriends of my teammates. This was still traumatic for my partner and I tried to be there every moment for her to calmly talk through it with her, making sure I never invalidated her feelings. I was never able to bring true light to this situation other than just like my teammates sticking up for me and saying that if I was doing something like that they would have smacked me or told me the next morning. They all knew her and how much I loved her. We did not just brush this under the rug but we were also to come to some realization of how odd this was and the initial honest responses from my teammates to this all showed their disbelief and confidence that I never acted like that.

That wasn’t the part where I ruined it, this is. About a week later I was finally home and packing up to leave for our trip when I got a phone call from a number I didn’t recognize, I answered it and it was the one ex I had from 5 years ago. I kinda hate this person they were toxic and I was at my worst when I was with them. I used to have insane anxiety and would throw up when I’d see her when we were breaking up. I built myself back up after and knew it was for the best and it was, I found the love of my life years later when I was in a great place. Quickly on the phone she starts talking about how happy she is to hear about my success in my sport and at school and this and that. Then she goes I know you have a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend but I’m driving by (she lives far away) and would love to have coffee quickly and hear about your successes. Super odd and then just like that I made a decision rooted in ego and insecurity that I wouldn’t mind her to see how well and healthy I am now, I don’t have any desire or lust for this person. We had coffee right after and about 10 mins in I mention my girlfriend and then all of a sudden I feel what the fuck am I even doing here. I got up in a sort of panic, told her I needed to leave and this was a mistake and to please not contact me ever again. I was literally leaving on for the trip of a lifetime in the next week with the love of my life and I just decided to prove something to someone who means nothing to me. 

I then made this all worse by just wanting to pretend that 15 mins never happened. We literally were still going through some rebuilding after being falsely accused why the fuck would I put our relationship in danger for real this time. We were leaving for our trip so soon I was selfish and scared to tell her, thinking I could just take my love for her to another level and never ever put myself in a position to hurt her again in our lives. So I didn’t tell her.. then we’re having the time of our lives and she gets a follow request from this ex and then it goes away 1 minute later (5 weeks in). She asks me why she would do that and I lied and said I’m not sure. Then the next morning she gets a message from this person saying I cheated. Instantly my girlfriend gets feelings of ptsd from before, thinks I slept with her, and books a flight home the next day. I tried to tell her we went for coffee and nothing more but I put myself in a position not to be believed and lost her just like that. I drove her to the airport, we said we loved eachother and she said she hopes we can be together in another lifetime because I was supposed to be her forever.

So fucking crushed she was such a good girl and didn’t deserve any of that. Our relationship was deep we were fully intertwined in each others lives and families, she told everyone I was the one for her and the same with me. Once she was home she initiated no contact and the only way I can love her now is by respecting that and not causing her anymore anxiety. I am definitely struggling with the way this was twisted to her thinking I acted the ultimate betrayal. I also came home too and of course knowing she has been telling everyone I fucked my ex and she has been on a full on summer performance of being single. She called me once to cry and tell me she hasn’t been handling this right by partying and numbing (not like her at all). I also knew she had made out with some guy at a concert but honestly, I just love her so much and am so ashamed of how I hurt her that I would never be mad at her. I consoled her when she cried to me, I tried to tell her my truth again, but she just blew this up so much when she got home and I understand, she’s acting in serious pain. Also to mention I tried to call this ex to ask her to please at least clarify we went for coffee and she said no, then began to cry and tell me she has had feelings for me ever since and thought there could be a world where we’d be back together. Disgusted.  

Now I created a messed up reality for myself, by erasing every moment of loyalty and deep love I had for her in exchange for coffee and an ego fuelled decision to try and show off to someone that was my darkness, even when I was safe and happy with my light. I have taken this so seriously maybe almost too much. I see counselling every week but I obsess over how I hurt her I am wired to love deeply and she was the one for me. I obsess over the fact she doesn’t know the truth and it is spread around everywhere. I am not on social media and I know that everyone that knows us is watching her perform and probably believes the same story as she does. I live my truth everyday because that is all I can do and I am growing into the exact man I was supposed to be but with self control and loyalty as my staple. Thanks for reading.

Y’all. Y’ALL. Libraries here are insane. I went to three of them today (my city, my county, and Denver) and had to pick my jaw up off the floor each time. Why isn’t this talked about more?? When you submit a change of address upon moving to Denver, why don’t you get an email or a little flyer in your mailbox that says, “Welcome to Denver! Please visit the local libraries - they’re better than the ones you’re used to, we promise!”


Each library I went to was staffed by the most helpful people who seemed genuinely pleased to help me get a library card, discuss events and classes, and talk about library-related apps. I’ve heard about Libby and Hoopla for years but Alabama libraries don’t support them, so cut to me standing at the information desk finally joining the 21st century. Kindle Unlimited only gets you so far 😂


Also, the checkout amounts and lengths are completely nuts in the best way. Each library I went to had checkout limits of 60-100 books, and each book auto-renews 3 times unless there’s a hold on it. My city’s library basically told me that unless there’s a hold on the book I’ve checked out, I can hang onto it for a year before they get antsy about it. WHAT???


Finally, y’all’s libraries have a lot of cool extras. Coffee shops, book clubs, free movies, sewing/knitting/mending/painting/crafting events, and event and attraction passes to parks, museums, etc. And used book stores inside the libraries! For dirt cheap! I came home with probably 30 books today and spent less than $100 total.


Anyway, I’m jealous of all of y’all who grew up with all of this stuff being the norm. Please tell me y’all take full advantage of the resources you have available to you.

- Volumetric brew so we’re not refilling every time
- Timer for overnight prep
- Good for single serve straight into coffee mug or tumbler. 

I’ve read enough to know it makes good coffee. But is it also friendly to someone who just wants to dump in the grinds and push a couple buttons?  I know I could check most the boxes with a cheaper machine, but I’d like to use it as well, and don’t want 2 machines.

After losing half our senior staff, I assigned the position of Chief Conn Officer to an actual con, because he's the best pilot we could have, plus all the other criminals onboard hate his guts and he's clearly the Maquis commander's ex-boyfriend, and tbh I need *some* entertainment out here. 

Anyway, convict-pilot drove a little over the speed limit and began ""evolving"" into an amphibian as a result. Then he kidnapped me for a joyride that turned us both into giant, genetically superior salamanders. We went to a swamp, fucked, and made three salamander babies. 

Luckily it turns out being turned into a salamander is like being turned into a newt; you get better. Unless you're born that way. After talking it over, we decided to leave our three mutant bastard children alone in a swamp planet and head back towards earth. 

I'm feeling very conflicted about the waste of resources. The hedgehog could've whipped up a nice creole dish out of those lizards. Not to mention the gator-skin handbag and boots I could've had.

I spent some time axing it, and then within a few minutes of knife work I noticed the end bowl starting to check (the bowl side was from the interior of the branch not the exterior). I carved away the cracked part and started hollowing out the bowl, thinking that taking away material would relieve some of the tension, but it just kept cracking in new places. Surprisingly it was splitting in the part that was furthest from the pith. I tried dampening it to see if that would prevent more cracks but no luck. This has happened to me with plum wood once before. Is it due to it drying too fast, or just tension in the branch being relieved? It's pretty straight-grained and knot free, though when I split it the split was showing slight twist.

Do I need to let the logs dry out more first before carving? Should I carve it in shorter sessions and keep it damp in the meantime?

I recently bought an ECM Classika and have been using it for a few weeks now. Thus far, I have been using water filtered through my fridge into a BWT pitcher with a magnesium filter in it. The TDS out of the pitcher is around 60ppm. Recently I became aware of https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-water-calculator/ and just was able to test everything. My pH is super low from the strips I’m using to test, around 6.0 maybe 6.1. With the GH and KH measurements I’m getting, the calculator on barista hustle is saying the water I’m using is -2 LSI and causing corrosion to the machine. 

I also just got a Zero Water tank which is giving me 0 ppm TDS but seems to be even more negative LSI.

My tap water is around 110ppm TDS. 

At this point, is my best option to use Zero Water pitcher and then adding potassium bicarbonate with rpavlis recipe? 

Is there any option available to have water going into the machine that is safe for the machine and won’t cause corrosion/limescale but also has the proper minerals in it for good tasting coffee too? Something like third wave sticks?

At this point if I’ve pulled about 15 shots and done some regular back flushing with the machine with the BWT water, has that already caused much damage to the machine? And until I get potassium bicarbonate or third wave or whatever ends up being my best option, am I better off using the zero water without adding anything else or going with the water from the BWT pitcher?

I hadn’t slept in two days. We met, purely by chance, on some fringe site and exchanged a couple pictures and talked. We lived close to one another and decided to meet for coffee. You were the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen and may ever see. The moment you turned and blushed and the sun hit your face is imprinted into my mind. You were incredibly smart, witty—legitimately intelligent. I hadn’t had or spent much time looking for you in life but you were basically perfection. Introspective, aware, wanting what’s best but a bit at odds with yourself. Precious inside and out. 

We met again and spent hours together. You were honest. I could tell you were looking for loyalty and trust. We both were. At the time I just couldn’t see it for myself. I was losing my mind slowly still, I think you could sense it. You asked me about my life and I didn’t know how to respond as my reality was splitting in two and the timeline of my life was getting blurry. Maybe I said one too many things. I think that’s where I lost you. I knew I was losing you I just wish I could’ve told you how strong you are because I don’t think you could see it.

also the way he vibes with shreya?? adorable. love their banter, love their comfort level, love the whole energy. but also… i won’t lie… a tiny part of me (okay not that tiny) is like 👀 what if i somehow just… ran into him one day?? like maybe fate could do its thing and drop me into a coffee shop he’s in. or an open mic. or idk, anywhere that isn’t just me behind a screen crying over someone’s sense of humor.

i feel delulu but also completely valid. he’s just that good. and it’s not just the comedy, it’s the expressions, the delivery, the timing — everything. man’s got IT.

so real question: does anyone know how to casually (non-creepily) end up where he performs or hangs out? like is there a way to meet this man without turning into a stalker?? i just want to manifest a chill “oh hey didn’t see you there” moment that turns into 3-hour conversations and us falling in love over shared memes. is that too much to ask???

This is an expansion on the Act 2: Scene 3-5 of Outgunned Pre-generate campaign Project Medusa. But it can be adapted for any Outgunned Campaign. In the playtest this adds about 2-3 hours of extra playtime. This does add a few things that may have consequences down the line so be prepared to make adjustments on the fly in the next Act. I encourage you to copy and paste this into a document and customize it to fit your game. If you see any typos or formatting errors no you didn't. 

Regarding the map. Little struck though S indicates a secret passage. Staircase on the right ascends to upstairs Staircase on the left descends into the cellar.

# Garden

*Stamos’ villa is an old-fashioned building surrounded by a huge garden. The tree-lined driveway that leads to the main entrance is lined with luxury cars, impeccable valets, and dressed up big shots. On each side of the huge front door, there is a sharply-dressed bouncer who checks invites with a digital scanner and welcomes the eminent guests. A red carpet is rolled out between you and the main entrance, press and photographers line the walkway clamouring for the attention of various guests.* 

* **Guards**
   * *Security is tight and on alert, The well manicured Garden crawling with guards roaming around periodically pausing to speak into their ear pieces*
* **Carmen Rosales (Anchor Voice)** \- News Anchor: *Short and thin, red hair in a chic pixie cut, She wears a conservative blue dress covered with a matching blazer. She is holding a microphone and is placed in front of a large camera.* 
   * **Carmen Rosales:** Good evening, I’m **Carmen Rosales**, reporting live from the private gala of Greece’s greatest living humanitarian, Konstantin Stamos. Celebrated philanthropist, global visionary, and tireless patron of science. Rumor has it, Mr. Stamos has some sort of BIG announcement planned… Tonight! A better future may be just hours away and once again, it begins right here, with the handsome… alluring… 
* *The broadcast is interrupted but some scuffle*
   * **Carmen Rosales (Through her teeth):** Cut the cameras!
   * **Maria** ***\[A short round older woman cries out as she is escorted off by security\]*** **(Older, Frantic)**: No please! I must speak to him! He knows where my boy is! 
      * **\[Critical Action Roll\]** to intervene. Son Gustavo signed up for some sort of clinical trial 8 months ago and has been missing since!
      * The police have been no help!
      * Can have players meet Gustavo later on in Act 3
      * **\[Fail\]** She is dragged around the corner and put into an unmarked car
* **\[Basic Action Roll\]** *You catch a glimpse of a young girl, with long brown hair and big brown eyes wearing a blue dress.* (This is Penelope see Ballroom) 

# Getting in:

* According to my blueprints (bottom of this doc) to the right of the main entrance is a staff entrance and car park. *This place is bustling with activity. Security, Catering, Kitchen staff are rushing in and out of that door*. Not guarded per se but you may be questioned if you don't look and act the part, luckily there are lots of vans, hedges and dark corners to lure people in for an outfit change.
* I have the sewers option lead into the Cellar on this document.  
* For the infiltration mechanics refer to Act 2: Scene 3 (8-10). My players had tickets both times so I ignored the book as there were plenty of things that could go wrong later on :)

# Rooms (Downstairs)

# Ball Room: 

*Then the party begins in earnest and, while a string quartet plays an incredibly sweet melody, hundreds of wealthy men and women crowd around the big white tables illuminated by huge crystal chandeliers. The drinks are flowing chatter and laughter fill the air*

* Guards
   * *Guards are a constant presence, lurking in every corner, tense and alert. Both stairways are flanked by two guards each, dressed in a unique uniform denoting a higher station. There is a guard posted at the last door on the right* (Library) *checking guests against a list before letting them enter.* 
* *A woman passes with a tray of champagne.* (Keep note of who drinks, I have it so wine and champagne are laced with the Project Medusa Virus. This will have consequences you will have to adlib later down the track so proceeded with caution. More info in Cellar)
* A loud crash draws your attention, 
   * **Anastasia Velis**: *Tall and willowy woman with long flowing brown hair. Her sharp eyes and overfilled lips are twisted into a scowl* 
      * **Anastasia Velis (Breathy snooty naisally)**: Hour dare you! Do you know how much this dress cost? 
   * *A young female waiter is on her hands and knees trying to scoop up the broken shards of champagne flutes. The tray rolls towards your feet* ***\[Less engaged Hero\]***.
* *The music stops for a moment then a slow melodic waltz begins to play. Women gasp and giggle grabbing onto their partners and dragging them to the center of the room.*
* **Carmen Rosales (Can't shake the announcer voice)**\- Loud, tipsy, and gossip-prone a perfect info source. *By now the conservative blue blazer is long gone and it seems her crew did not get an invite.* 
   * Knows she is a puppet and doesn't care. It's all about the fame and money baby!
   * I gave her a Southern accent and she proudly states she is from the 5th biggest news station in all of Texas. 
* A ex lover of one of our **\[Less Engaged Heroes\]** appears
* *A small blonde boy maybe 12* (Timothy Van Palton the third) *is pulling the hair of a small brown haired girl with big brown eyes* (Penelope). *She escapes his grip and slips expertly under a nearby table*. 
   * She can tell your players about hidden passages for a price!
      * Price 1: The Jar of lollies guarded by Head Chef – **Eleni Karahalios** in the kitchen. Her feather forbade her from having sweets and the stuff at the gala is all that boring bitter grown up dark chocolate stuff. 
      * Price 2: Revenge on Timothy the boy who always bullies her at these things
   * She is the secret illegitimate daughter of STAMOS, but don't give this info right away.
   * Her bedroom is guest 1.
   * You can find her crayon drawings on the underside of tables and inside the secret passages. Among the typical childlike drawings you can discern a sense of loneliness and isolation. 
   * She is scared of the Celler, it's spooky down there :(
   * If a Player knows Sita she will recognise them from a photo the nice science lady keeps hidden and has shown her.

# Kitchen

*You enter the bustling commercial kitchen, with gleaming state of the art appliances and the scent of delicious food that makes your mouth water. Food that doesn't hold a candle to your cheap hotel continental breakfast. Its Chaos, Chefs are barking orders, staff are hustling and rushing to put out orders.* 

* Head Chef - **Eleni Karahalios**: Late 50s, stern and no-nonsense, with burn-scarred hands and the constant scent of oregano and cigarette smoke. She commands her kitchen like a battlefield.
   * Has a soft spot for Penelope but is under strict orders not to let her get to the lolly jar.
   * The secret ingredient in her cooking is love. 
* Head waiter - **Gustav Elemento**: (haughty French) Tall thin late 40s, dark hair with a receding hairline and thin pointed moustache. 

# Security (Locked)

*In what seems to be some sort of fancy entertaining space a haphazard security room has been set up. Thick monitors stacked precariously on top one another with cables going every which way. A guard sits in front of the fuzzy black and white security feed playing something on his Game Boy. Three off duty guards sit and play cards around a table.* 

* Head of Security - **Markos Theodorou:** Bald, tan ex-military in his 40s, lean and composed with a crooked nose and eyes that miss nothing. 
* Can be circumvented by the secret passage. There is a latch you can open in the secret passage that allows you to see into this room. You see though the eyes or a portrait. 

# Drawing (Locked)

*This lavish entertaining space is filled with overstuffed expensive furniture surrounding a grand fireplace. Hunting trophies of endangered animals line the walls. Chairs are lined up in front of a projector screen. In the middle of the room tied to a chair is a man broken and bloodied*

* This is the side room mentioned in the book stamps goes to after his speech, there are 3 options:
   * This is where security would take you if you are captured
   * If a player was away last session and you need to get them back in the story they can be found captured here
   * Or you find a NPC Spy - **Lysandros Petralis:** Mid-30s, bloodied, bruised, one eye nearly swollen shut. Still manages a smirk through the pain. His hands are tied behind his back, but he radiates defiance.

# Cloak

*It's a cloak room, nothing to see here.*

* A benevolent Director would let a player find an appropriate guest outfit here. While me, a certified asshole would argue you would only find coats and bags. But hey you find One $ of cash for your troubles.

# Gallery (Locked)

You enter a large gallery or what used to be a gallery. It currently seems to be some sort of makeshift storage space. Dust cloths lay over various crates and boxes.

* Idk obligatory gag is that the real **\[insert famous painting\]**?
* I see this as a place STAMOS is storing all his post I control the world now propaganda 
   * Stamos Bobble Heads
   * MESA Make The World Safe Again (Sorry im not that clever)
   * Banners, Propaganda posters e.t.c

# Bathrooms

*They are bathrooms*

* Someone throwing up in the toilet maybe
* Maybe overhear some gossip
* Probably some white powder on the sinks

# Library (Guarded)

*A burly looking guard is posted at the furthest door from the entrance on the right. In the doorway is a velvet rope blocking your path.* 

*Before you is a large personal library, Leather bound tomes line the walls floor the ceiling with comfy nooks a plenty. The air is heavy with smoke here as the richest of the rich gather around blackjack and roulette tables smoking cigarettes and greasing palms*

* Suspicious looking waiters coming up from the cellar with trays of wine and champagne (see cellar)
* Black jack
   * You can win info or a favour here
   * **Russian Mobster** Loses It and accuses another at the table of cheating and pulls a hidden knife. Security leaps into action and escorts them out.
      * **(3) Théo D'Arcy:** Fawning over Stamos, openly flirts with players, secretly fencing stolen artifacts.
      * **(4) Captain Dinos Kouris:** Toasts Stamos constantly. Will recognize anyone he’s seen on wanted posters
      * **(5) Mr. Fox:** Notices the Heroes sneaking around and wants to play both sides
   * I made a simple gambling mechanic, The number next to each name above represents their dice pool. The player rolls the skill they wish to use and you roll for each of the NPCs. Each round player with the least amount of successes is eliminated. Spotlights and Adrenaline are encouraged. 
   * What are they gambling? Cash? Info? Help? Maybe an NPC needs a favour? Like stealing and destroying a ledger from STAMOS’s office. 
* Ex-Spy - **Irini Galanis**. Early 40s, sharp features and eyes that always scan the room like she’s measuring exits. She once worked for an agency, now she works for the highest bidder in this case, Stamos.



# Celler (Hidden)

*The temperature drops as you descend down the cramped staircase. It is cool, dark and dank. There are shelves and shelves of wine of the most expensive vintages. In the middle of the room on a table is a makeshift bottling operation. Freshly sealed bottles of the white and red wines and the champagne you saw circulating upstairs sit in crates by the table.* 

* (I have it so wine and champagne are laced with the Project Medusa Virus. This will have consequences you will have to adlib later down the track so proceed with caution.)
* **\[Basic Action Roll\]** You know these vintages, they are not of Greek origin and certainly not bottled in this room. 

* **\[Critical Action Roll\]** You are familiar with this sort of operation, but that bottle and dropper ore out of place are not like anything you have seen before.
   * In my game players who drunk any of the circulating drinks have been infected with Project Medusa
* Many books about folklore, cryptids and occult shit on desk
   * **\[Locked Drawer**\] (Urdu) Indian folklore and the creatures that lie within (one page is town out)
* You enter here if your players took the sewers

# Information:

The following is a list of information that can be gleaned from guests

* **\[Basic Action Roll\]:**
   * Everyone considers Stamos a philanthropists (emphasise this and with all the guests gushing about him)
   * Whispers of a new announcement from his research lab
   * Kind of popped up out of nowhere
* **\[Critical Action roll\]**
   * They found something in one of his digs
   * Trouble in one of his labs, a hasty relocation.
   * Secretive and very powerful people fund him
   * Stamos controls local law enforcement, and the top brass of the police are on his payroll as well as the media. 
   * Climbed quickly in the ranks during Balkan military operations
      * Whispers of War crimes
   * Doctor Sita Khan is still alive and currently at Stamos’ party. 
   * He has purchased an abandoned marble quarry and is and has dropped a lot of money building something but everyone involved is sworn to secrecy. You can’t even get close.
* **Progress the story \[Critical Action Roll\]**  Stamos’ study is located on the top floor of the villa, where no guest is ever allowed to go*.* All doors are blocked by agents of Stamos’ SECURITY TEAM. The only way to get there without arousing suspicion, is to create a diversion.

# Rooms (Upstairs) [Guarded]

# Living space

# This room consists of a kitchen and a lounge, a door in the back likely leads to a bathroom. The only sign that anyone lives there is the empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter. 

* If they use secret stairs: *You see STAMOS back towards you staring blankly at a mirror, seemingly transfixed. After a few long moments his whole demeanor shifts back straightening and his mouth twisting into a dazzling smile. A picture of confidence and ease this is the charismatic KONSTANTIN STAMOS you have heard so much about. It is creepy. Before you can react he turns on his heel and is out the door. You hear the distant crown erupt as he appears at the top of the stairs.*
   * **Act 2: Scene 4** plays out per the book but the heroes can see it as the peer over the railing. The boring presentation takes place in the Drawing room. 

# Guest 1

*When you open the door your eyes fall upon a man and a woman sitting on the edge of the bed. They are kissing passionately the mans hand begins to wonder, the womans eyes open and meet yours.*

* \*Sheiks\* GET OUT! She throws her stiletto at **\[Hero\] \[Basic Reaction Roll\]**
* **\[Basic Action Roll\]** The only indication a child is living here is the single old well worn teddy bear on the bedside table

# Guest 2

*The lavish guest bedroom is currently unoccupied, though the bed is unmade. Some women's clothing and belongings lay scattered around (This where Sita Khan has stayed for a few days).*

* **\[Critical Action roll\]** *You notice the corner of a photo poking out from under the mattress. Two grinning teenagers stand side by side, The girl who is taller and slightly older has her arm wrapped around* ***\[The person who knows Sita\].*** 

# Master

*The heavy curtains are drawn tight, it's dark and you are unable to make out much. The room is sparse and devoid of any life or personality. The large bed is made with military precision.* 

# Office: 

* The guards who are posted outside the door are currently leading over the railing watching STAMOS’s Speech. Making it very easy to sneak up on them.
* Refer to Project Medusa Book

I hope this is the right subreddit to post this in.
Im on 10mg fluoxetine (started about 12 days ago) and 40mg vyvanse (started February this year)
I had 3 ish hours of sleep last night so I decided to have some coffee with my breakfast today.
Had caffeine and my medication around noon. It is now 7:37pm.

About an hour ago I started really feeling my heart beat, and my legs started to feel cold. 
I think it’s related to poor circulation though… 
When I was only on vyvanse every time I stood up I’d feel really faint and feel like I was 80% unconscious while trying not to fall. 
That happened to me earlier but really strong. Since then I’ve stayed in bed since even sitting up makes me feel faint.
My hands are also quite sweaty and warm, weird to the contrast of my feet being cold. 
And idk when I started to feel shakey but maybe like 40 minutes or 30 minutes ago.

I mean they’re always cold I have poor circulation I guess.

I just checked my pupils, they look a normal amount of dialated. But I feel more dissociative than normal.
