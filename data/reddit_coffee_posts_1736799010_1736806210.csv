1i0q4cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i0q4cs/looking_to_meet_early_retired_folks_in_the_bay/,Looking to meet early retired folks in the Bay Area!,"Hey FIRE community 👋 I'm in the Bay Area and planning on pulling the FIRE plug in just a few months! Can't believe it's finally almost here.

Anyways, most of my friends have W2 jobs and I'd love to meet other early retired folks in the Bay Area.

A little about me and some of my interests: in the East Bay, older 30s, gay, tech geek, enjoy pickleball and several other sports, cooking, hot springs, travel, hiking / backpacking. After I FIRE, one project I want to work on is continue developing and eventually release an app that I've been working on (with the help of AI!). Have a bunch of other entrepreneurial ideas in mind I'd like to eventually try out for fun.

If I sound like someone you might get on with, feel free to comment or ping me directly! Happy to grab a coffee sometime.

\*\*\*

P.S. I also just created [r/bayarea\_FIRE](/r/bayarea_FIRE/). Realize our community already has all sorts of popular sub-FIRE groups (leanFIRE, chubbyFIRE). But I thought it would be helpful to have a location focused FIRE group for the Bay Area (e.g., focus on meeting neighbors, case studies/questions tailored to the region).

Shared a similar post on that sub-reddit. But since it's brand new, there's only 1 member... yours truly LOL Since I'd like to actually meet folks, posting here as well.",1,1736806108.0,financialindependence,0,1.0,False

1i0px7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1i0px7h/dating_sucks/,Dating sucks,"It’s just so exhausting. It’s like a rapid ping pong of emotions, social effort, and time commitment. I’m 28 and have been on dates with dozens of girls the past few years. For one reason or another it always falls apart. My last serious relationship was 4 years long almost 3 years ago. 

Current vent story: I met this girl on hinge a few weeks ago. We’ve been on 2 dates and have been texting very consistently. 

She is such a sweetheart and has a great personality. In fact, she is basically everything I’m looking for in terms of soft qualities (personality, ambition, culture, etc.) we get along great and have really good conversations, joking around, similar interests, etc. 

With that being said, I increasingly feel like her photos on hinge were a little misleading and are a few years old. For our first date I noticed this but really didn’t think anything of it because we met for coffee on a cold winter day and we were all bundled up. She has a very pretty face. On the second date I noticed more of her physical traits since we were in more of a private setting and I honestly realized I’m not as physically attracted to her as I thought/had hoped. 

I’m the type of person who really values physical/sexual attraction in a healthy relationship and not sure what to do. I genuinely enjoy spending time with her, talking to her, and see myself with her in a longer term but she made a comment of why I wasn’t trying to be more romantically physical and kiss her etc. and I guess I realized I subconsciously was reluctant to? 

I woke up today freaking out a little because I’m unsure of how to handle this. Should I give her a chance and see if maybe I’m overthinking this? Or should I let her know how I feel and end things? Part of me wants to give her a chance because I know she has a really active lifestyle right now and she went through some tough years recently, which I of all people can definitely understand. With that being said, I don’t want to waste my or anyone else’s time.

This is where psychic readings come in—like a cosmic flashlight shining light on your path! 🌟🔮 But seriously, psychic readings aren’t just mystical mumbo jumbo; they’re a way to gain insights, understand patterns, and maybe even uncover answers to those burning questions.

Love and Psychic Readings: What’s Written in the Stars for You? 💕🌌  



Love is probably one of the biggest reasons people turn to psychics, and honestly, who can blame them? Whether you're crushing hard, stuck in a complicated situationship, or trying to rekindle an old flame, love can be super confusing. 😩❤️ Psychic readings give you insights into your love life that you might not even realize you need.  



Psychics can tune into your energy and tell you if someone special is vibing with you or if they're just… meh. They might even pick up on whether your soulmate is just around the corner or if you need to work on yourself first. 🌈✨ It’s like a little nudge from the universe telling you where to focus your love energy.  



The best part? A good psychic won’t sugarcoat things. If someone isn’t meant for you, they’ll help you see why it’s better to let go and make space for the love you truly deserve. Is he the one? Should you text her back? Psychic readings can offer surprising clarity, helping you skip the overthinking spiral.  



Money Matters: Unlocking Abundance with Psychic Insights 💸💎  



Who wouldn’t want a little extra cash flow in their life, right? Psychic readings can actually give you some practical advice about your financial future. Whether you’re wondering if a new job offer is worth taking or if your big business idea will pay off, psychics are here to decode the universe’s signals. 💼✨  



They might help you figure out your financial blocks—like maybe you’re holding onto limiting beliefs about money. Ever heard of manifesting abundance? A psychic reading could guide you on how to align with that energy. It's not magic, but it does feel pretty magical when things start falling into place.  



Psychics can also warn you about potential risks, like investments that seem shiny but are really sketchy. 🌟 And while they aren’t stockbrokers or financial advisors, they can help you tune into your intuition, which is your greatest tool when it comes to making money moves.  



Career Guidance: Aligning Your Purpose and Path 🛣️🎯  



Ever feel stuck in your job, wondering if it’s even worth it? Or maybe you’re at a crossroads, unsure if you should take that leap of faith into a new career? Psychic readings are an incredible way to gain perspective on your professional life. They won’t just tell you if you’re on the right path—they’ll also help you discover what truly aligns with your soul’s purpose.  



Psychics often pick up on talents or passions you might be ignoring. Maybe you’ve been settling for a stable job while your heart is quietly screaming for a creative career. 🎨✨ Or maybe you’re worried about starting your own business but keep seeing signs that the universe is saying “go for it!” Psychics can validate those feelings and give you the courage to move forward.  



Even if the path ahead looks uncertain, a psychic can help you understand the lessons in your current job and whether sticking it out will benefit you in the long run. Career confusion, meet clarity!  



How Psychic Readings Actually Work 🌠🔮  



Okay, let’s address the big question: how do psychic readings even work? Are psychics just reading your body language or Googling your name before a session? Nope! A legit psychic connects with your energy and taps into universal forces (like spirit guides or tarot cards) to bring you messages that resonate deeply.  



Some psychics use tools like tarot cards, crystals, or astrology charts, while others rely purely on intuition. For example, a tarot reading might show you what’s blocking your love life or why you’re feeling stuck in your career. The cards don’t lie—they’re like little mirrors reflecting what’s going on in your life. 🔮💫  



Energy is a huge part of psychic readings. If you’re open and willing to receive messages, the insights will flow naturally. The key is to approach your reading with curiosity and an open heart. It’s not about getting all the answers; it’s about gaining clarity and learning how to make empowered choices.  



Real Stories: Psychic Readings That Changed Lives 🌈✨  



Ever heard those crazy stories about how someone’s life completely turned around after a psychic reading? It happens more often than you’d think. One woman I know was stuck in a dead-end job for years, feeling totally uninspired. During a reading, the psychic pointed out her creative talent and encouraged her to start painting again. Long story short, she’s now selling her art online and living her dream. 🎨  



Another friend of mine was torn between two romantic options. The psychic didn’t just say, “Pick him!” Instead, she guided her to look within and see who truly aligned with her values. Spoiler alert: She chose the guy who made her heart sing, and they’re now planning a wedding. 💍  



Psychic readings aren’t just about predicting the future—they’re about empowering you to create it. They’re a way to take control of your destiny while still leaving room for magic and surprise.  



Common Misconceptions About Psychics 👀🔮  



Let’s clear up some myths, shall we? First of all, psychics aren’t mind readers. They don’t have a crystal ball that shows them every detail of your life. Instead, they pick up on energy, symbols, and messages that can guide you.  



Another misconception is that psychics are scary or spooky. Honestly, most psychics are super kind, down-to-earth people who genuinely want to help you. They’re not here to tell you something terrible will happen or freak you out. Psychic readings are meant to uplift and inspire, not scare you into making decisions.  



Lastly, psychic readings aren’t set in stone. Think of them as a snapshot of the energy surrounding you right now. If you don’t like what you hear, you have the power to change it!  



How to Choose the Right Psychic for You 💖🔮  



Not all psychics are created equal, and that’s okay! Finding the right psychic is like finding a good therapist or a great cup of coffee—it takes a little trial and error. Look for someone with good reviews, clear communication, and a vibe that feels right to you.  



Some psychics specialize in certain areas, like love or career, so make sure to choose someone who matches your needs. And remember, it’s okay to shop around until you find someone who truly resonates with you.  



What Questions Should You Ask a Psychic? 🤔✨  



The best psychic readings happen when you ask specific, open-ended questions. Instead of saying, “What’s my future?” try asking, “What’s the energy surrounding my love life right now?” or “What steps should I take to achieve financial abundance?”  



Asking the right questions helps the psychic tap into your energy more effectively, leading to insights that feel meaningful and actionable.  



Love, Money, Career: The Big Three 🔮💖💰💼  



When it comes to psychic readings, love, money, and career are the holy trinity of questions. They’re the areas where most of us crave guidance, and they’re also where psychic insights can be the most transformative.  



Love readings help you understand the dynamics of your relationships, money readings reveal blocks and opportunities for abundance, and career readings offer clarity about your purpose and path. Together, they create a roadmap for navigating life with confidence and clarity.  



Why You Should Try a Psychic Reading 🔮🌟  



If you’ve never had a psychic reading before, what are you waiting for? It’s an experience that can open your eyes to possibilities you’ve never considered. Whether you’re seeking answers about love, money, or career, a psychic reading can provide the clarity and inspiration you need to move forward.  



And hey, even if you’re skeptical, what’s the harm in giving it a shot? You might just walk away with insights that change your life.

We carry a local cold brew and nitro cold brew on tap - would those work well? - foam and taste? I could pick up Fee Foam as well, I'm just worried a watered down cold brew might be too watered down after shaking for foam.  
  
How does regular black coffee (at room temp) work with an espresso martini? 

Or should I look into a type of espresso concentrate? There is a coffee shop near us that we partner with, maybe I could try to get a bulk discount batch of fresh espresso - that might be an option. 

Another bar I worked at we just used Trader Joe's Cold Brew which people really enjoy but personally I feel it kind of is too light compared to proper espresso.

Here’s what I loved, what could’ve been better, and whether I’d recommend it to others. 🧵👇

1️⃣ First Impressions: Location Wins Literally steps from Myeongdong Station (Exit 9). Perfect for exploring street food alleys and shopping (your wallet may cry, though). Super convenient if you’re using the airport bus—no need to drag your luggage far. Honestly, if you’re here for sightseeing and food, you can’t go wrong with this spot. 

2️⃣ The Room: Clean but Dim I stayed in a standard twin room, and it was spotless. The view of Myeongdong Cathedral from the window was a nice bonus. But the lighting? It’s on the darker side. Not ideal if you like bright spaces. Also, no toothbrush or toothpaste provided—kind of annoying but manageable. Small gripe: the pillows were a bit too soft for my liking. 

3️⃣ Hidden Gem: The Rooftop Foot Spa Hands down my favorite part of the stay. It’s a small open-air foot spa with a great view of the city—so relaxing after walking around all day. Only downside? It’s seasonal, so check if it’s open before you book. This was such a unique touch—I haven’t seen it at other hotels. 

4️⃣ Breakfast: Skip It or Try Nearby Cafes Breakfast is served at Butterfinger’s Pancakes. It’s decent, but honestly, there are so many great cafes and bakeries nearby. If you’re not in the mood to pay extra, just grab a coffee and croissant outside instead. 

5️⃣ Other Notes The staff were great, super helpful, and fluent in English. The elevators can get slow, especially during checkout times, so plan ahead. The gym is... small. Don’t expect a full workout session here. 

Would I Stay Again? If I’m visiting Myeongdong for food and shopping, then yes, absolutely. The location is unbeatable, and the rooftop foot spa is a fun bonus. But for longer stays or if you need more amenities, I might look elsewhere.",1,1736805111.0,Hotelinkorea,0,1.0,False

1i0poud,https://i.redd.it/l3qn1bh01uce1.jpeg,THEY COULD NEVER MAKE ME LIKE THESE TWO,"Dan and Vanessa are arguably two of the most insufferable characters on Gossip Girl, and their combined energy could drain the life out of even the most dramatic episodes. Let’s start with Dan “Holier-Than-Thou” Humphrey. Dan constantly judges the Upper East Siders for their privilege and moral shortcomings, yet he spends the entire series desperately trying to infiltrate their world. He’s quick to condemn their behavior but has no problem benefitting from it when it suits him. Take his infamous exposé Inside, for example: he writes a whole book dragging everyone in his life but enjoys every single perk of being Lonely Boy turned It Boy. The hypocrisy is unbearable. Let’s not forget the ridiculousness of him being Gossip Girl. How does someone who claims to value integrity run a blog that ruins lives—including his own sister’s? The mental gymnastics are exhausting. Dan also has a perpetual victim complex. He acts like the world is out to get him, but the truth is most of his problems are self-inflicted. And his “I’m just a humble Brooklynite” act? It’s old, especially when he’s living rent-free in a massive loft his dad owns in one of NYC’s priciest neighborhoods.

Now, let’s drag Vanessa “I’m Not Like Other Girls” Abrams. Vanessa loves to position herself as the voice of reason, the outsider who’s too indie and authentic for the Upper East Side’s drama. But here’s the thing: she’s just as messy as everyone else. Whether she’s blackmailing people, scheming for a film grant, or dating literally every male lead on the show, Vanessa is knee-deep in the drama she pretends to despise. Her relationships were awkward at best and unbearable at worst, from the forced chemistry with Dan to whatever that disaster with Nate was. Vanessa’s holier-than-thou attitude made her unbearable. She would constantly preach about being above the drama or privilege, all while conveniently taking advantage of it whenever it benefited her. And don’t even get me started on her endless speeches about filmmaking or “the struggle.”

When Dan and Vanessa teamed up, it was a perfect storm of insufferable energy. Their combined self-righteousness was exhausting. They’d sit in their Brooklyn coffee shops whining about how shallow the Upper East Side was, only to throw themselves back into the chaos at the first chance. Their constant moral posturing made them seem like the kind of people who bring hummus to a steakhouse and expect applause. Together, Dan and Vanessa embody the worst traits of self-proclaimed outsiders who secretly crave the spotlight. It’s no surprise they’re among the least-missed characters on the show.",6,1736805024.0,GossipGirl,0,1.0,False

We like coffee and meet new people. This Sunday, we will visit Tico Coffee Roasters in Campbell.

We discovered Tico Coffee Roasters last Christmas when they ran an open-house day at their roasting facility in Campbell. We loved how Tico Coffee Roasters has introduced Costa Rican coffee heritage to Bay Area coffee culture since 2012. We enjoyed our quick chat with Mariana, founder of Tico Coffee Roasters, and decided to put coffee fun together quickly. 

On 1/19 Sunday, the owner will be able to host a coffee tasting for a small group of 10 people. We currently have two people signed up. We are looking for 8 more people to make our coffee table ☕️

Details about our 1-hr coffee tasting:
* Small private group of 10 people
* At Tico Coffee Roasters' roasting facility in Campbell
* Led by Mariana, co-founder of Tico Coffee Roasters

It's a chance to geek out about coffee with other coffee enthusiasts in an actual roasting facility! We'll taste different beans side by side and really dive into understanding coffee nuances. Great for anyone looking to explore their coffee preferences and meet other coffee lovers in the area.

* When: Sunday (Jan 19), 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
* Participation: $50/person

I see moms putting their newborns on routines, successfully getting them to sleep, putting baby in a carrier/wrap or their buggie and heading out to run errands. 

I’m basically hibernating in my home (most specifically on the second floor of my home, in my bed next to my babies bassinet) because I am so scared of falling out of the 2-3 hour periods of breastfeeding, wake windows, changing diapers, settling for sleep, waiting for the sleep cycle transition.

I’m too afraid to do basic things like shower, brush teeth or hair, make myself a coffee or even eat because of how unpredictable LO’s schedule is. 

My LO is only 5 weeks old and we’re heading into the 6 week fussiness a little early. Sometimes he is super easy to settle and other times not - big eyed and taking in the world that he is able to see right now. To add to the frustration, he doesn’t enjoying being in the carrier so I can’t wear him around either and he doesn’t fall asleep on me for contact naps. 

A usual schedule looks something like this:
• 10 minute wake and diaper change
• 40-60 minute feed on the breast
• 10 minutes burping and being upright to avoid bad reflux
• another diaper change if he poops before a nap. At this point he is over his wake window (his is roughly between 45 minutes to and hour before he becomes overtired)
• 20-30 minutes to convince LO to sleep by usually swaddling and rocking him or popping him in the buggie for a 30 minute walk
• transferring him to the bassinet
• 15-25 minutes waiting for the 45 minute sleep cycle change and hoping it’s successful. More often  it’s not a success and he wakes so I spend the time between the transfer and the next feed trying to get him to sleep again to avoid the overtired trap).

Sometimes I add in tummy time, a bath, and other wake window activities but he often eats well beyond the wake window, so I skip these more often than I do them. 

Am I the only one not getting it? How is it possible to do everything I see other moms doing within these 2-3 hour periods? They’re out running errands, doing wake window activities, bathing LO frequently and I’m here sitting in the same milk stained pajamas I put on 4 days ago fearing that I won’t be able to finishing typing this before LO realizes he doesn’t want to be asleep anymore. 

I want to be able to go to the grocery store, maybe a cafe for a coffee with friends, or even have friends come over to visit, but how do I work around every 2-3 hours when LO eats for a long period and doesn’t settle easily…",7,1736804753.0,newborns,7,1.0,False

1i0pjme,https://www.reddit.com/r/SXM/comments/1i0pjme/report_on_a_week_in_orient_bay/,Report on a week in Orient Bay,"My husband and I visited Orient Bay three times before Hurricane Irma, but this was our first visit since then. The beach was just as beautiful as we remembered. This time we rented a beach condo from [Côté Soleil](https://cotesoleil-conciergerie.com/en/properties/caribbean-riviera-20/) to accommodate our family group of three couples and two small children. It was perfect.

**There is no ATM machine in walking distance of the beach!** The closest one is at Hope Estate (near the Super U) which is a short drive away. If you don't rent a car, make sure to withdraw cash at the airport, or ask your taxi to stop at Hope Estate on the way to the beach. All the stores and restaurants take credit cards, but cash is preferred for tips, and is required for beach purchases (like a coconut with a straw) and the Pinel Island ferry (phooey -- see below).

We ordered groceries ahead of time from [SXM Les Halles](https://www.sxmleshalles.com/en/). This was a tremendous convenience! After our arrival we mostly bought groceries from the Petit Casino market. It had a good variety but seemed to run out of things like coffee and paper towels at just the wrong time. We ended up renting a car, so we also made a couple of trips to the well-stocked Super U.

The food in Saint Martin is great! The first night we got gourmet lasagna to go from On Dirait le Sud. We had dinner at two restaurants in ""Orient Village"" (the cluster of restaurants in the heart of Orient Bay), Le Piment and l'Atelier. Both were excellent. L'Atelier was more expensive, but I've never tasted better steak or risotto.

One night we walked to l'Astrolabe for their Friday night lobster special with live music. It was fun. Another night we used our rental car plus a taxi to drive to L'Auberge Gourmand in Grand Case. It was delicious but the portions were skimpy.

We liked the breakfast pastries from Good Morning Café, but surprisingly found the baguettes better at Petit Casino.

We ate lunch at a couple of different beach bars. Our favorite was WAI.

On previous visits we never left the beach at Orient Bay, but this time we were more ambitious and **took the ferry to Pinel Island one day -- but wished we hadn't**. We all preferred the water and waves at Orient Bay, and the ferry service is atrocious. Since you can't reserve a seat online, and they don't even have an old-fashioned ""take a number"" queuing system, you have to line up in the hot sun to try to get a place in the boat. If the boat is full you then have to wait another half hour or so. Never again!

Having sampled beaches in St. Thomas, St. John, Puerto Rico, Grenada, St. Kitts, and Jamaica, there is no doubt that Orient Bay remains our hands-down favorite. We will be sure to return.",4,1736804654.0,SXM,2,1.0,False
1i0pjhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1i0pjhp/love_letter_to_heaven/,Love Letter to Heaven,"Hey Pa! 

It has been 2 years since you received your angel wings and we miss you a lot. You know what? I've been beating myself cause I cannot remember your voice anymore l...i remember how you look and the lil things you did but I can't remember your voice. I hate it cause not matter how hard I try I can't remember it. All I remember is that your voice gets soft when you call me ""Iska"" and how I tremble when I hear your booming voice call me by my full name when you're mad. 

I miss the Sunday pancakes for breakfast cause everyone is at home and we'd wake up to the aroma of pancakes and freshly brewed coffee. Sunday lunch was even better with the Sinigang na Hipon and grilled Liempo. Afternoons were even better cause we'd goof around sing to the songs you and mama love. You'd even dance to the Bee Gees song and we'd all giggle and laugh. We rarely see you smile but when you do the whole house lights up. 

You were never showy of your affection for us but you showed it in your own way. As a grown ass adult I feel loved whenever I go to work with the packed lunch you've made at 4am. You'd pick me up or wait for me til I get home when I come home late. You'd smile proudly and tell grandpa how proud you were when you saw me play bball and I took a lot of hits and gave them twice the hit. I remember how big your smile was when you saw me beat up the bully knowing your daughter will never back down. What I like most was when you remembered our birthdays! Growing you never did remember but the last 2 years with you you were always first to greet me and kiss and hug me. The last 2 years with you.. you were very vocal with the ""I love yous"". You were catching up for the time we rarely heard those growing up. It may have been late but I am glad we heard them. 

Pa, thank you for being kiddo's father figure. Because of you He doesn't feel incomplete. You showered kiddo with love and care that he was a spoiled brat at times. Honestly Pa... I feel lost when you gained your wings. I realized I have no clue on how to raise a boy. Just got lucky I got through to the kid. He still challenges my authority pero he is doing his best to be good. Pa, your apo got grit and character and I am proud of him.  Oso, he is growing up fast and his looks are leaning more to our genes (Buti na lang!). 

Filling in your shoes is hard. I have to deal with mom's topak when when she's emotional. Sorry if at times I snap at her cause I'm not you. Pa, you weren't perfect but I saw how you treated mom and you were a gentleman. I saw how you guys made time for each other and how you guys chose to make things work when everything gets tough. Let me borrow your patience when dealing with Ma. I love her to bits but she drives me over the roof at times. 

Pa, I miss the times I can rant about work or whatever shit that was bothering me. In a house full of people Ikaw lang nakikinig sa akin. Yes, you nag me pero you listen. The past months were hard Kasi I had to keep 'em bottled up I had to hold my tongue and tears. Until now I can't cry openly at home cause if I do Mom might crumble. Pa, sorry but until now I am messed up for signing and calling DNR on you. And I dread the day I have to do it again. As much as I want to pass that burden to my other sibs... I can't. I don't want them to know the soul gnawing pain. Until now I get messed up when I remember that day. 

Pa, continue to watch over us and guide me in filling your shoes. Sorry I was not able to give you yung experience to walk me down the aisle and I know you'd want that to happen. Pa, sorry but that is so impossible. You raised a strong woman sa sobrang strong pati plumbing and electrical works inaaral ko na din. So don't worry about me. I'm good. All good... If you've got other plans lemme know. Just don't send me kamikaze moths medj nakakapraning e! It's crazy having a moth swoop down on me in a moving trike or enclosed space. 

I'm done crying... I miss you Pa. Send my regards to everyone and please pat pat our beloved Rov, Milk, and Bingo for me. Hope they're keeping you company.

Any experience navigating similar situations?,"So, my partner and I have had a really big argument about this tonight, and I am trying to find ways that we can manage our situation better. It seems that we are in a spiral situation.

For the past weeks, I have had a severe depressive episode. I cannot sleep, cannot get out of bed, cannot focus on anything, and forget to do basic self-care things like eating or showering. Every small-ish problem feels huge and overwhelming and so do normal tasks. The only thing I currently do in life is getting my degree and it feels like I can barely manage that. My partner has been picking up a lot of this slack, doing more chores than usual, like cooking more meals and taking care of our cats. He is also quite busy because he works full-time and is getting a degree too.

That’s also where part of the problem is: Clearly, this division is extremely unfair towards him. I know that, he knows that, and it cannot continue like that. But every time that I try to get back into a better routine of doing more chores, I feel overwhelmed by ”his” household and fall back into a mental paralysis that feeds the depression.

I have always been a clean-as-you-go person, and in my past depressive episodes this has become a vital mechanism for keeping my surroundings under control when my mind was in a bad state. Coffee grinds on the counter? Wipe immediately. Dirty dishes? To the dishwasher right away. Used an appliance? Back to the cabinet before it grows roots. Cat litter spill? Get the hand vacuum. Something removed from its designated spot? Put it back if you aren’t using it. And so on and so forth, you get what I mean. 

He, on the contrary, has always had a more messy way of doing things - it isn’t just because he now has a lot to do, it was the same at times when he wasn’t busy. He just doesn’t feel the immediate urgency to clean and tidy up after himself. He isn’t gross or anything, but he just doesn’t get overwhelmed by the mess and cleans it maybe every couple of days.

Example situation: When I get up, there are some clothes on the floor. I pick them up to take them to the laundry basket. As I go into the hallway, I see that a bit of cat litter has spilled on the floor. I go to grab the hand vacuum. In passing the kitchen, I see that the counters are filled with things and dirt and things sitting on dirt. I stand there with the clothes in one hand and the vacuum in the other, overwhelmed by where to start, and find myself slowly putting the vacuum away and going back to bed, leaving the clothes where I found them (because I didn’t even know if they were dirty and where they belong). I cannot bear to get up again and see the kitchen.

But at the same time, I know that those things are there because of the work my partner does. In this example, the clothes had dropped while he had folded and put away laundry. The cat litter had spilled when he cleaned the litterbox. The kitchen was messy because he had made coffee and breakfast, including a cup and a portion for me.

I want to do those things too. Like, I want to do laundry (and pick up fallen items). I want to care for our cats (and vacuum the spilled litter). I want to make breakfast and coffee (and wipe the counters and put the dishes away). I want to be a part of this. I want to escape this constant feeling of being overwhelmed. But everything is too much and somehow my brain is unwilling to do these things if my surroundings aren’t clean. And so the cycle continues and my partner does more and I cannot function enough to even help.",1,1736804432.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Raised (and met) in Colorado Springs, went to college in Fort Collins, moved to a suburb of Denver for work and stayed there a couple years, then moved back to Colorado Springs. Neither of us loves Colorado Springs. We like it I guess (especially where we are now, on the west side). But we just want to experience something else. We have talked about moving to Washington for several years. At first it was Seattle, then we shifted to Olympia. We both work remote. We have a dog, no kids. We are both pretty outdoorsy, love walking on trails with our dog, longer hikes on the weekend, camping, fly fishing, that sort of thing. My wife is a pretty big runner. We are also both kind of homebodies--we don't go out a whole lot and tend to prefer a trip to book store or coffee shop over a bar. We will be renting for at least a few more years, and want to move somewhere with a similar COL to the springs.

We visited Seattle a few years ago, I loved it but my wife is a little less excited about big cities. Anyway it's out of the question for moving because it's too expensive. We ideally want to be somewhere with access to the ocean and the mountains, in a town with character and personality (not so many strip malls, chains, etc.), and a good sense of community. We are really excited about Olympia because of the access it provides to the sound, Olympic NP, Rainier NP, Seattle, Portland, the coast, so many random lakes and rivers. I have done a lot of looking at photos for parks trails and what not in and around Olympia and it just looks incredibly beautiful to me.

Speaking mostly for myself now, I really want to be somewhere greener and wetter. I love the rain and we get almost no rain here. I know this is unusual but I am not a huge fan of the sun. Greatly prefer cloudy days. Now, I'm sure that comes from having lived in a sunny state my whole life and maybe after a couple winters in the PNW I will miss the sun, but that's okay, we are both open to the idea of returning to CO after a couple years, like I said we just really want to experience something different, so it would be better to have a drastic change that we don't end up loving than to go somewhere too similar to CO. As for my wife--she is really excited about the idea of living closer to the ocean, being able to visit the beach or see tidepools, and likes that Olympia is a smaller town. 

Part of the appeal of WA is that we are still within reasonable driving distance of home to visit family. We have talked about other regions but it just feels like it would be tough to pull the trigger because we'd have to fly home to visit, and then we'd have to leave the dog, and who is going to watch her, etc...

I have really built up the PNW in my head and romanticized it to some degree and just looking for a potential reality check, or maybe other cities that we should consider. We are already also looking at Bellingham and Astoria OR... I've seen good things about Eugene OR on here, does that seem like a good fit for us? The only real advantage I see with Olympia over those cities is that it is more centrally located giving you much better access to explore a variety of things, and that's pretty much why we're moving. Vancouver is another one we considered but it seems like it completely lacks character and has a very suburban feel. 

Here are some specific questions about Olympia / PNW:

* Is the town/surrounding area actually as cool as it looks? It seems like there is so much nature and the town is pretty, nice, clean, etc., cool old buildings, waterfront views...
* Is it easy enough to make friends?
* We are pretty moderate politically, and our perfect town would have a climate that reflects this. I know that this is not true of Olympia, but it seems like a compromise I could make. I just don't care about politics very much at all, so it doesn't bother me that Olympia is liberal. But would you say that the political climate is overwhelming for a moderate person? Do you have to be a die hard liberal to love it there?
* How bad is the homeless problem? I've seen mixed things and I feel like people just complain about homelessness no matter what lol.
* How often does it get the freezing rain that makes the roads really dangerous? We're used to bad roads here obviously but is it worse than CO?
* Is the coast in Washington / Oregon nice enough that you can have a picnic on the beach in the summer? Swim in the ocean?
* In Colorado there are basically no bugs, the occasional tiny spider maybe. How bad are the bugs in the PNW? In particular, are there a lot of spiders (wife hates em lol)? Are ticks a problem?",6,1736804357.0,SameGrassButGreener,13,0.88,False
1i0pfgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/healingspirit/comments/1i0pfgr/navigating_the_path_of_good_grief_ten_signs_of/,Navigating the Path of Good Grief: Ten Signs of Healing and Growth,"**Introduction:**

 Though often overwhelming, grief is a natural part of the human experience and a testament to the depth of our love and connection. Healing from loss does not mean forgetting the person or transition we are mourning; instead, it means learning to carry their memory with strength and grace. The process may feel like a winding road, with moments of progress and setbacks, but each step forward is a victory. Acknowledging your pain and permitting yourself to heal is one of the most extraordinary acts of self-compassion you can offer.

The journey through grief also brings with it profound lessons about resilience, love, and life’s impermanence. As difficult as it may seem, the pain of loss often carries the seeds of growth, helping us cultivate greater empathy, gratitude, and self-awareness. While the intensity of grief may never entirely disappear, the edges soften over time, allowing moments of joy and peace to re-enter your life. Healing is not about erasing the pain but about finding a way to live fully and meaningfully despite it.

It is essential to recognize that each individual's path to healing is unique. There is no set timeline or “right way” to grieve. What matters is finding healthy ways to express your emotions, whether through journaling, talking to a trusted friend or counselor, or engaging in spiritual or meditative practices. By embracing the process and leaning into support systems, you can emerge from grief not only with a deeper understanding of your strength but also with the ability to honor the love and legacy of what you have lost. Remember, healing is not a destination but an ongoing journey that transforms sorrow into a quiet strength that carries you forward.

 

 

**Accepting the Reality of Loss:**

 

One of the initial steps toward good grief is accepting the reality of the loss. This involves acknowledging the absence of the loved one and the profound sense of sadness that accompanies it. Through this acceptance, healing begins to take root.

Accepting the reality of loss is a crucial first step on the path to healing, yet it is often the most challenging. Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in grief research, emphasized that acceptance does not mean being ""okay"" with the loss but rather acknowledging it as a part of your reality. This acceptance creates space for you to process emotions without denial or resistance. Grief expert David Kessler adds that acceptance is about finding a way to incorporate the loss into your life rather than trying to move past it entirely. By gently confronting the pain, you allow yourself to engage in the healing process fully.

In this stage, the importance of self-compassion cannot be overstated. Grief expert Megan Devine highlights that healing is not about fixing the pain but learning to coexist with it. She suggests mindfulness and grounding exercises to help you stay present, even in the discomfort. Journaling can also be a powerful tool to process feelings and document progress, offering a safe space to explore the complexities of loss. By treating yourself with patience and kindness, you nurture the foundation for emotional resilience.

It’s also important to note that acceptance does not happen overnight. Grief is nonlinear, meaning you might revisit earlier emotions like denial, anger, or bargaining as you work toward acceptance. Dr. Alan Wolfelt, a renowned author and grief counselor, refers to this as ""relearning the world"" after loss. According to him, it involves redefining your relationship with the person who has passed while finding new ways to engage with the world around you. This may include creating rituals or symbols of remembrance that honor their life and your ongoing connection to them.

Ultimately, acceptance opens the door to hope and transformation. With time, you may notice subtle shifts, such as moments of peace or gratitude for your shared memories. These glimpses of light remind you that joy can coexist with sorrow and that healing is possible even in the face of profound loss. As you continue to walk this path, guided by expert insights and your inner strength, you learn to survive and thrive, carrying forward the love and lessons of the person you’ve lost. This is the essence of good grief: a journey that transforms pain into growth and love into an enduring legacy.

 

 

**Accessing and Expressing Emotions:**

 Grief often brings with it a complex array of emotions, including profound sadness, anger at the circumstances of the loss, guilt over things left unsaid or undone, and confusion about how to navigate life without your loved one. Each of these emotions, while intense, is a natural response to loss and a reflection of the deep connection you shared. Recognizing and expressing these feelings healthily is vital in the healing journey. For instance, journaling can serve as a therapeutic outlet, allowing you to articulate thoughts and emotions that might be difficult to voice aloud. Even if they are no longer here, writing letters to your loved one can also help process lingering regrets or convey unresolved emotions.

Support groups provide another invaluable avenue for expression. Sharing your experiences with others who understand the weight of grief can foster a sense of connection and validation. Hearing others' stories may also inspire hope, showing you that healing is possible, even in the depths of sorrow—individual or group-based therapy offers a professional space to explore and unpack these emotions. Therapists trained in grief counseling can provide tools tailored to your needs, such as cognitive-behavioral techniques to address guilt or mindfulness practices to manage overwhelming sadness.

Creative outlets can also play a significant role in expressing grief. Painting, music, or crafting can provide a nonverbal way to process complex emotions, translating your inner turmoil into something tangible and meaningful. Physical activities like yoga or walking in nature may help channel anger or confusion into movement, grounding you in the present moment. Each of these methods serves as a reminder that expressing grief is not about fixing or erasing emotions but about honoring them as part of your healing process. Recognizing the courage to confront and express these feelings is a powerful sign of progress in navigating the path of grief.

 

 

**Adjusting to a New Reality:**

 Adapting to life without a loved one is one of the most challenging aspects of grief, but it is also a critical step toward healing. This adaptation involves acknowledging their absence and reconfiguring your daily routines, roles, and relationships in a way that honors their memory while allowing you to continue living fully. For example, if you share morning rituals like having coffee or walking with the person you’ve lost, creating a new morning routine—perhaps journaling, meditating, or walking with a friend—can help fill the void while maintaining a sense of purpose.

Another example lies in handling responsibilities that may have previously been shared. Learning to take on these roles can initially feel overwhelming if the loved one takes charge of specific household tasks, such as managing finances or cooking meals. However, seeking support from friends, family, or professional resources can ease this transition. Over time, mastering these new responsibilities can foster a sense of empowerment and independence, marking significant progress in the adjustment process.

Adapting to a new life also involves creating new traditions or rituals to honor the person’s legacy while making space for your growth. For instance, if you celebrated holidays together, you might light a candle in their memory, create a scrapbook of past moments, or volunteer in their honor. These acts allow you to preserve the connection while creating a sense of continuity and purpose in your new reality.

Social connections often require adjustment as well. If your social circle was closely intertwined with the person who has passed, it might feel strange or isolating to engage in familiar activities without them. In this case, exploring new social opportunities—such as joining a book club, taking a class, or engaging in a hobby—can provide fresh sources of connection and joy. These changes do not diminish your loss; they signify your ability to carry your memory forward as you rebuild a fulfilling life. Each small step in adapting to this new normal is a powerful affirmation of resilience and healing.

 

 

**Maintaining Physical and Emotional Well-being:**

 In addition to physical self-care, prioritizing emotional and mental well-being is equally essential during grieving. Activities like mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, or practicing yoga can help regulate overwhelming emotions and provide a sense of calm amidst the storm of grief. Seeking creative outlets, such as painting, writing, or playing music, can also serve as a cathartic release for emotions that might feel too heavy to articulate. Equally important is allowing yourself to rest and recharge; grief can be physically and mentally exhausting, so honoring your need for downtime without guilt is a critical act of self-compassion. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals—whether trusted friends, family, or a therapist—can create a nurturing environment where you feel safe to express your feelings and receive encouragement. By tending to both your physical and emotional needs, you build the strength necessary to navigate the challenges of grief and begin the journey toward healing.

 

**Finding Meaning and Purpose:**

Amidst the pain and sorrow, individuals on the path of good grief often discover a renewed sense of purpose and meaning in life. This can involve actively seeking personal growth, honoring the memory of the loved one through acts of service, or pursuing new interests and passions.

 

Reconnecting with Others:

Healthy grief involves reaching out to and connecting with friends, family, or support groups. Nurturing these relationships is crucial in providing emotional support and a sense of belonging and facilitating the grief-healing process.

 

**Rediscovering Joy:**

Even amidst grief, the ability to experience joy and happiness is a positive indication of healing. Finding pleasure in simple things, laughing, and engaging in enjoyable activities is integral to the grief recovery journey.

 

Developing a Sense of Inner Strength:

The grieving process can be immensely challenging but presents an opportunity to develop resilience and inner strength. The ability to face and overcome adversity and cope with intense emotions shows progress toward good grief.

 

Embracing Growth and Transformative Change:

Grief has the power to bring about profound changes in our lives. Those on the path of good grief often experience personal growth, increased self-awareness, and a deeper understanding of the fragility of life. Embracing these transformative changes is a positive sign of healing.

 

Cultivating Religious and Spiritual Awareness:

Religion and spirituality can be powerful resources for those navigating the bereavement process. Incorporating spiritual practices, seeking solace in religious beliefs, or finding comfort in rituals and traditions can provide hope, meaning, and connection, contributing to the healing and grieving journey.

 

**Conclusion:**

Good grief is a multifaceted process that involves healing, growth, and transformation. By recognizing these ten signs of progress, individuals can navigate their grief journey with a greater understanding of their healing process. Additionally, integrating religion and spiritual awareness can offer solace, hope, and a sense of higher purpose during these challenging times. Remember, grief takes time, and each person's journey is unique. Embrace the signs of healing, seek support, and be kind to yourself as you move forward.

 

 

***Always choose the path to Good Grief when you move through the bereavement process.  You will always meet healing along the way.***

My boyfriend and I (early 20s) are planning a trip to Ecuador for March and need travel advice. We are adventurous and outdoorsy but not into very dangerous extreme sports. We love hiking, cultural experiences, yoga, animal sightings, etc. and need more ideas of things to do at the locations we’ve picked out. We’d generally prefer to do things outside of pre-planned, paid tours, but of course sometimes it’s worth it! So if you have any tour recommendations, please let me know. 

1. We are planning to fly into Quito and go straight to a yoga cabin in the Mindo cloud forest, then do the 3 waterfall sanctuary hike the next day. We’d also like to walk around Mindo a bit and potentially do a coffee/chocolate tasting. 

2. We’d then head to Cotopaxi. We found a hostel that does airport retrievals, and we were curious if it would be a good idea to go back to the airport after Mindo as I know there are no buses that go straight into Cotopaxi. If you have any other ideas for this let me know. We’re also struggling finding things to do in Cotopaxi, such as a good hike that is not actually summiting Cotopaxi. We don’t need to spend too much time there but would like to get a good hike in, and if there are other cool cultural experiences to do during the day or night, please let me know. 

3. After that we’d like to head to Baños. Here is where we hit a wall- we need some solid recommendations for Baños. I’ve also been reading that it’s imperative to visit Puyo if you’re going to Baños, which we can allot for time wise, but I cannot pinpoint anything to actually do there other that pre-planned jungle tours. Is that it? If so, can someone recommend me one that is worth the money? 

Thanks so much. We originally planned to stay in Ayampe/Montanita as well as the rainforest, as we both surf and love the bohemian vibe, however deemed it was maybe too much to do in one trip and didn’t want to spend the whole time traveling. If you think we should reconsider, let me know, but since cutting it out we are low on the activities list. 

Also, I’m prone to migraines and altitude sickness, and with all of the altitude change within this trip I was wondering if anyone had any tips to alleviate or prevent it. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

Furthermore, we’re aware of the political climate we’re going into, and if you have any safety tips or precautions to be aware of, please let me know. Anything helps.

And then I top with a [puck screen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CMWZHJC8).

My brew starts with 10s of preinfusion at line-in pressure. I get the ""correct"" amount of flow for my recipe: 19g in, 40g out, ~30s of brew time (not including preinfusion) at 95ºC. But the flow is extremely uneven.

The machine itself is a [Profitec DRIVE](https://www.profitec-espresso.com/en/products/drive). I've upgraded the shower screen to an [IMS Nanotech E61](https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/ims-nanotech-e61-shower-screen). The pump pressure is correctly set to 9 bar (the video shows brew chamber pressure on top of the group head and the boiler pressure gauge, the pump pressure gauge is only momentarily visible). I grind with a [first-generation DF64 with stock burrs](https://df64coffee.com/products/df64-coffee-grinder). The coffee I use I is fresh and a light-medium roast. I let it age on my counter until 2 weeks or so after roast date, at which point I portion out roughly a week's worth to keep on my counter and freeze the rest to be pulled out in weekly increments.

I've tried a lot of things. The best theory I have is that I'm somehow grinding too fine, causing the huge pressure overshoot as water is having to work too hard to get through the puck. But grinding less fine very quickly gets me brew times under 20s. I'm really not sure what to do at this point.

Symptoms seem to start 1- 2 hours after eating foods like clock work.

Endoscopy all clear and stool test also all clear.

I see her bf now my brother in law to be very cunning . He took 15 L of gifts under the title of 'no dowry'. I mean wth . I visited her 2 times in 2 years and both the times felt so disrespected and ignored by her husband. He basically gives silent treatment and cut cost on various day to day stuff .

It always felt so disrespected and havent been to her house like 15 months

Now , basically situation is messy , i don't feel the need of doing anything because she is in different city and all . I do the formal greeting of 'namaste' and using ji as prefix and answer if asked anything. I don't want to mess up my sister's household

1i0p2y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i0p2y0/nobody_knows_who_mr_kapricurn_really_is_but_i/,"Nobody knows who Mr. Kapricurn really is, but I know what he’s capable of","It started the way it always does. A dream. A struggle. And a man who promises to make it all come true. My dream was music, and my struggle was everything else. My days were a cycle of coffee and frustration, busking in busy plazas where nobody stopped to listen, and playing open mics where the applause was as thin as my wallet. I wrote simple songs, earnest lyrics, plain melodies; nothing stuck. Every time I uploaded a track online, it sank into the void.

Then, on an unremarkable Wednesday evening, everything changed.

I was at a dimly lit bar, strumming my guitar for a handful of patrons who just didn’t care. As I sang the final verse, I spotted him in the back corner. He wasn’t drinking. He wasn’t scrolling through his phone. He just watched, his pale eyes locked onto me like I was the only thing in the room.

After my set, he approached me. His voice was smooth, low, and deliberate, every word soaked in control.

""You have a gift,"" he said. ""But a gift is wasted without someone to help you share it.""

I blinked, unsure if he was mocking me. ""Thanks, I guess.""

""No guessing,"" he said, handing me a card. His name gleamed in gold letters ""Mr. Karpicurn"" and below it was a single phone number. No email, no title, no company name. ""Call me when you’re ready to make your mark.""

He walked away before I could respond. The scent of him lingered, a faint scent of cigarrettes and fancy perfumes, and for days, I couldn’t shake it.

I almost threw the card away. If this was the unprobable event he actually was an executive and could give me a fast rise to the top, I wouldn't take it since I wanted to believe I could make it on my own. But every rejection email, every blank audience, every skipped meal chipped away at my pride until eventually, I called.

The meeting took place in his office, a sleek fortress of glass and shadow perched above the city. The desk was bare except for a single sheet of paper and a pen. The contract was unnervingly simple. It said one thing: deliver the music, and the world will listen. I stared at the blank spaces waiting for my name and signature.

""What’s the catch?"" I asked.

""No catch,"" he said, smiling faintly. ""Only consequences.""

His words rattled in my head, but the promise of success drowned them out. I signed.

In the beginning, it was everything I’d dreamed of. My songs, once ignored by the uninterested audiences of low end bars, now swept across streaming platforms like wildfire. A producer reached out to collaborate, a hitmaker whose name alone could launch careers. Within months, I was headlining shows. My lyrics were being sung back to me by audiences so massive they looked like oceans of light. The world knew my name and I loved it... for a while.

The first crack in the dream came quietly as the exhaustion didn’t hit all at once; it crept in, slowly and insidiously, like a fog rolling in until I couldn’t see where I had started or where I was going. The first few months were euphoric. My songs were everywhere. I was everywhere. People stopped me on the streets, at airports, in coffee shops. ""I love your music,"" they’d say, and for a while, that was enough.

But as the months bled into each other, something shifted. The songs they wanted weren’t the ones I wanted to write. The raw, personal lyrics that came from nights spent in my cramped apartment, guitar in hand, were now stripped bare in boardrooms. Committees of producers and executives chipped away at them, turning my stories into something sanitized, marketable. My melodies were drowned in layers of auto-tuned choruses and synthetic beats, until they no longer sounded like me.

""You’re an artist,"" they’d say. ""But this is a business. It’s not just about the music, it’s about the brand.""

At first, I fought it. I argued over lyrics, over arrangements, over my image. But every battle I won felt like a hollow victory, and every battle I lost carved a piece of myself away. ""Trust the process,"" they’d tell me. ""This is how you make it to the top."" And I wanted to believe them, because the alternative was admitting I’d traded my soul for a dream that wasn’t even mine anymore.

The burn-out wasn’t immediate, either. It built like a slow crescendo. Early on, I didn’t mind the studio sessions that stretched into the early hours of the morning. The adrenaline of creating something new kept me going. But the adrenaline faded, replaced by deadlines and the constant demand for more. More singles, more press, more appearances. It felt like I was running on a treadmill that sped up every time I thought I might catch my breath.

Sleep became a luxury I couldn’t afford. Studio sessions bled into photoshoots, which bled into interviews, which bled into rehearsals. My schedule was packed tighter than the arenas I was starting to fill. The people around me noticed. My manager, my assistants, they started slipping me little things. ""Take this,"" they’d say, holding out a pill. ""It’ll help you focus."" Or, ""This will take the edge off."" I’d resisted at first. I didn’t like the idea of needing something to keep going. But the longer the days became, the easier it was to give in.

The pills became part of my routine. One to wake up. One to stay awake. One to bring me down after a high-energy performance. They called it “balancing the scales,” but I didn’t feel balanced. I felt numb. The highs weren’t as high anymore, but the lows were deeper, darker.

The worst part was the mirror. I’d catch my reflection in backstage dressing rooms or bathroom breaks during endless flights, and I’d stare at the man looking back. He was gaunt, his eyes sunken, his skin pale under layers of expensive makeup. There were dark circles under his eyes, no matter how many professionals tried to conceal them. He looked... wrong.

But what hurt the most was the emptiness in his eyes. When I first started, my eyes burned with passion. I’d see videos of my old self, singing to tiny crowds in dive bars, and my gaze was so alive, so hungry. I missed that hunger, because now I couldn’t feel anything at all. I’d tell myself I was doing this for the art, but deep down, I knew my art wasn’t mine anymore. I wasn’t writing songs, I was writing ads disguised as songs. The lyrics weren’t stories; they were slogans.

To cope, I leaned harder into the distractions fame provided. The parties were endless, every room filled with people who wanted something from me. I wasn’t lonely, how could I be when I was always surrounded by so many people? but I felt alone. So I drank. I smoked. I let the music at the clubs drown out my own thoughts. The bad habits felt like a salve at first, but they only left me feeling more hollow.

I told myself it was all worth it. After all, the fame I’d always wanted was mine. People were singing my songs, screaming my name, streaming my albums. But in the quiet moments, when the noise died down and I was left alone in some five-star hotel room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d traded something irreplaceable for all of it. I couldn’t remember the last time I wrote a song just for me.

And that thought, the idea that my music was no longer my own, burned more than anything else.

On a particularly eventful day I walked into an art store, hoping to find something to get myself, maybe buy something to look at that wasn't the face of that disgusting man in the mirror and my walls. A woman, maybe in her mid 20's, was standing by a shelf of paints, her clothes splattered with crimson and black, her hair falling in uneven strands around her face. She looked exhausted, her eyes hollow, like she hadn’t slept in weeks.

""Hey,"" I said, looking at the unfinished art pieces. ""Are these any good?""

She barely glanced at me. ""Depends. Are you an artist?""

""Not really. Music’s more my thing.""

""Lucky you,"" she muttered, her voice bitter. ""At least people pay attention to that.""

Her words hit me harder than I expected. ""You okay?""

""Do I look okay?"" she snapped, then sighed, running a hand through her hair. ""Sorry. That was... uncalled for.""

""No worries,"" I said, stepping back. ""Rough day?""

""Rough life,"" she corrected. She hesitated, then added, ""I’m working on a commission, it's almost done though""

I looked at the completely blank canvas she was pretending to stroke with the brush on her hand. ""Who’s it for?""

Her eyes narrowed, and for a moment, I thought she might yell at me. But instead, she shook her head. ""Nobody you’d want to meet.""

As she walked away, I couldn’t shake the chill her words left behind. I didn’t know her, but something about her felt too familiar. Like a shadow I’d seen before.

The weeks that followed were chaos. Scandals erupted out of nowhere, paparazzi caught me stumbling drunk outside clubs I didn’t even remember entering. Rumors spread online about my ego, my temper. The fans who once adored me started to turn, whispering that I’d sold out.

Mr. Karpicurn was never far, always appearing when the cracks in my life were widest. ""This is what you wanted,"" he’d remind me, his voice silk and smoke. ""The world knows your name. Isn’t that enough?""

It wasn’t. The fame that had once burned so brightly now felt like fire in my veins, consuming everything I was. My friends were gone. My family didn’t recognize me. My music, my one salvation, was no longer mine.

I finally reached my breaking point backstage at a sold-out show. The roar of the crowd vibrated through the walls, muffled but insistent, like it was calling for a version of me I didn’t even recognize anymore. I stood in front of the vanity mirror, my chest heaving, sweat dripping from my temples. The lights above the mirror buzzed faintly, casting a sickly yellow glow over that face. And that face... it wasn’t mine. Not anymore.

The man in the mirror looked gaunt, hollowed out, as though someone had scooped out his insides and left only the shell. His cheekbones jutted out unnaturally, the skin stretched so tight it seemed ready to tear. His eyes were sunken deep into their sockets, ringed by bruised shadows that looked almost black, as if he hadn’t slept in weeks or years. His pupils were blown wide, drowning out the natural color of his irises, leaving only a faint ring of gray around endless darkness. The whites of his eyes were bloodshot, webbed with angry red veins that pulsed with every beat of his heart.

His skin had a strange, almost translucent quality to it. It was pale, but not in the way of someone who’d simply spent too much time indoors. It was sickly, waxy, like old candle wax left too close to the flame. Tiny cracks formed at the corners of his mouth, dried blood crusting over as if he’d been biting his lips raw. His teeth... when had they started to yellow? And his hands, gripping the edge of the vanity, were veiny and claw-like, the knuckles raw and swollen from endless fights with walls, doors, and anyone who dared to challenge him.

But it was the expression that truly made me recoil. The man in the mirror wasn’t angry or sad or scared. He was... blank. Emotionless. His face sagged under the weight of its own exhaustion, his jaw slack, his shoulders hunched forward. He looked like he’d been hollowed out and worn down by something far more powerful than any human should face.

Then there were the eyes. They weren’t just tired; they were hungry. Desperate. They stared back at me with an emptiness so profound it made my stomach churn. I felt like I was looking at something that wasn’t quite alive, like something that had crawled out of the depths of the earth wearing my skin as a costume.

My phone buzzed on the counter. I ignored it at first, my eyes locked on the stranger in the mirror. But it buzzed again, insistent, dragging me back to reality. I grabbed it with a trembling hand, swiping to open the notification.

There it was, plastered across every major social media platform: *\[MY NAME\] Refuses to Pay Crew Members, Accused of Exploitation.* My heart sank as I scrolled through the post. Photos of me in designer clothes, grinning on red carpets, contrasted with testimonials from stagehands and backup musicians, people who claimed I hadn’t paid them for weeks of grueling work. ""He’s rolling in cash while we’re barely scraping by,"" one person had said. Another claimed I’d screamed at them during rehearsal, calling them ""replaceable.""

I wanted to scream, to throw my phone across the room, but what gutted me was the fact that I didn’t even know if it was true. I’d lost track of the numbers, the contracts, the faces of the people who worked behind the scenes to keep this machine running. Maybe I hadn’t paid them. Maybe I had said those things. And even if I hadn’t, what did it matter? My name was already tied to the scandal, and in the court of public opinion, I was guilty.

The buzzing in my ears grew louder. The reflection in the mirror twisted and warped, the man’s mouth curling into a cruel, mocking smile. My chest tightened as I slammed my fist into the glass, shattering it into jagged shards that rained down onto the counter and floor. Blood welled from the fresh cuts on my knuckles, but I didn’t feel the pain. I just stood there, staring at the fragmented pieces of the mirror, each one showing a distorted version of the monster I’d become.

""I can’t do this anymore,"" I whispered.

Mr. Karpicurn appeared right behind me, his smile as sharp as ever. ""You’ve already done it. The deal is sealed.""

""Then take it back,"" I begged. ""Take the fame, the money. I don’t want it.""

He tilted his head, his eyes glinting with amusement. ""Fame is fire, my friend. It burns bright, but it consumes everything it touches. And you? You’re already ash.""

As the words left his mouth, the air in the room seemed to grow heavy. The walls of the dressing room shimmered like heat waves rising from scorched asphalt. My knees buckled as a sudden, oppressive heat enveloped me, and I stumbled backward, clutching the edge of the counter for support.

The world around me dissolved, replaced by something… impossible. I was standing in a cavernous, hellish space, the ground beneath me cracked and glowing with molten veins of fire. The air was thick with the acrid scent of burning sulfur, and the flickering light cast eerie, dancing shadows that seemed alive. Towering columns of twisted, writhing shapes rose from the ground, and I realized with horror that they were made of people... people like me.

To my left, a woman stood at an easel, her body skeletal and trembling. It was the woman from the art store, her paint-streaked hands moving mechanically, as though guided by some unseen force. Her canvas was impossibly large, stretching endlessly into the distance, and every stroke she made seemed to bleed, the colors alive with an otherworldly glow. She turned to glance at me, her hollow eyes locking with mine for a split second. She didn’t speak, but the pain etched into her face said everything. She was trapped, cursed to paint forever, her art consuming her piece by piece.

To my right, a guy who I assumed to be an engineer crouched over a set of plans laid out on a fiery stone slab. His hands moved frantically, assembling intricate blueprints that burst into flames as soon as he finished. He screamed, his voice echoing through the cavern, but he never stopped working. It was as if the plans were all that existed for him, an endless cycle of creation and destruction.

Behind him, a chef stood over a grotesque banquet table, chopping and cooking with feverish intensity. His knives moved faster than seemed humanly possible, slicing through meat that writhed and screamed as if it were alive. The dishes he plated shimmered with a sickly, tempting beauty, but as soon as they were placed on the table, they disintegrated into ash. His face was pale, streaked with sweat and soot, and he muttered recipes under his breath like prayers, his hands shaking as he continued his work.

In the distance, I spotted a magician on a raised platform, performing for an invisible crowd. He pulled endless chains of fire from his sleeves, conjured shimmering illusions that flickered and warped into grotesque parodies of beauty. His face was painted in a frozen smile, but his eyes, those eyes were full of despair. Every trick seemed to siphon something from him, leaving him gaunter, weaker, and more lifeless with each act.

I turned back to Mr. Karpicurn, who now stood at the center of this infernal gallery, his sharp suit unblemished by the ash and heat around him. His presence was commanding, untouched, as though this hell was his domain and he thrived in it. He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring, it was the smile of a predator ready to attack its next meal.

""This is what you wanted,"" he said, his voice smooth, echoing with an unnatural depth that seemed to shake the ground beneath me. ""You’re not the first, and you won’t be the last. I make dreams come true, my friend. But dreaming has consequences"".

I wanted to scream, to run, to claw my way out of whatever nightmare this was, but my feet wouldn’t move. The heat pressed down on me, suffocating, and the vision began to pull me in. I saw flashes of the life I’d had, of the life I’d wanted. My face plastered on billboards, my songs being sung by millions, the applause, the money, the fame. But those images twisted and warped into something else... tabloid scandals, broken friendships, isolation, and a hollow, endless hunger for more.

""You’ve all made the same mistake,"" Mr. Karpicurn continued, gesturing to the suffering souls around us. ""You all thought you could have it all without giving something in return. But don’t you see? Your dream was never yours to begin with. It was mine.""

I forced my head to turn back toward the painter. Her hand froze mid-stroke for just a moment, and she looked at me with something I couldn’t quite place... pity, maybe, or warning. The light of her canvas reflected in her hollowed cheeks, her hands trembling as she turned back to the impossible task before her. The others worked in unison, their faces varying shades of despair and madness, all trapped in an endless pursuit of their art, their passions turned into their punishments.

I opened my mouth to speak, to beg for release, but Mr. Karpicurn raised a finger to his lips. ""Shh,"" he said, his smile widening. ""You’re exactly where you’re meant to be. Every moment, you knew it wasn’t earned. It was gifted. And now, the time has come to give it all back.""

""No,"" I whispered, falling to my knees. ""Please. I’ll do anything. More music. More years. Anything but this!""

He crouched in front of me, tilting his head like a predator toying with prey. ""Anything, you say?""

I nodded frantically, tears spilling down my cheeks. I thought I saw a flicker of pity in his eyes, but it vanished as quickly as it came.

""Very well,"" he said, his voice like silk dipped in venom. ""If you wish to delay your descent, then so be it. But know this: your suffering will not be avoided. It will only change its shape.""

Before I could speak, the world around me shattered. The heat and people were gone, replaced by blinding lights and the roar of a crowd. My hands gripped the neck of my guitar, mid-strum. I was on stage again, bathed in the adoration of thousands. But something was wrong. Their cheers sounded wrong, their faces twisted into masks of something primal, something… hungry.

I tried to stop playing, but my hands refused to obey me. The strings burned against my fingers, but I couldn’t let go. My voice rose unbidden, belting out lyrics I didn’t recognize but somehow knew were mine. As the music swelled, I felt my body moving of its own accord. My feet dragged me to the edge of the stage. The crowd surged forward, hands outstretched. Their eyes were empty, their mouths open wide.

And then I saw it, the flames in their throats, the same fire I had seen in the pit. They weren’t fans anymore. They were my audience, my tormentors, and I was their eternal performance.

I tried to scream, but the sound that came out wasn’t mine. It was a laugh, deep and guttural, echoing in the space between my ears. The devil’s laugh.

The music wouldn’t stop. The crowd wouldn’t stop. And deep down, I knew the truth: this stage wasn’t a reprieve. It was my hell, and I would give them a show. 6 times a week, each lasting 6 hours spread across 6 days with a single day of ""rest"" that isn't really restful, filled instead with haunting planning of the next show.",2,1736803467.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False
1i0p298,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1i0p298/the_big_question_live_at_home_rent_or_buy/,"The Big Question: Live at Home, Rent, or Buy? ","22, moving to a LCOL city in June to start a new job. $80k base. Single. I will be in this city for a 1-3 year time horizon and will very likely be moving away after this period of time. Trying to figure out housing. I have three options: 

1. Live with my parents for nearly free. 
2. Live in a 1bed apartment. Would cost roughly $1200/mo. 
3. Buy a small, sub-$100k starter house, pay it off as fast as possible, with the intention of renting it out once I move away. 

Here’s my thought process about which options would be the best:

**In terms of saving/investing:** living at home is the best option. I would be able to save a HUGE percentage of my income for a big down payment down the road and grow my investment accounts substantially. The downside is that it’s a decently far commute from work, in a community with very few young professionals, and I’d have a somewhat limited social life. However, these are sacrifices I’m very willing to consider given the enormous financial advantages. Very grateful to have this option on the table.

**In terms of lifestyle:** renting is the best option. I highly value walkability and being close to work, parks, church, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. Renting downtown would allow me to do that. I would undoubtedly enjoy living downtown the most out of these options. I am a huge city person. However, I hate the idea of “throwing money away” on rent, which I already have been doing at university. Yes, I know spending $1200/mo to put a roof over my head is not necessarily “wasting” money, but with a house payment, each dollar is going toward building equity (minus the interest obviously), and living at home, I wouldn’t be spending money on housing at all. If finances weren’t in the picture, this is the option I’d choose. 

**In terms of long-term wealth building:** IMO, buying is the best option here. Some may disagree. There are a lot of small, very livable “starter houses” and even a few affordable duplexes for sale in the area. Thankfully, I have an adequate amount saved up for a down payment if I decided to buy. One of the other reasons that I want to buy is to have a rental property for diversifying my investments outside of the stock market and some extra cash flow. However, given that I will be moving away in a couple years, I would have to remotely manage a rental property when that happens (which I assume would be doable, but very hard). I am very serious about getting ahead financially, and would like to start my homeownership journey as early as possible.

I’m very blessed to have all of these options on the table, but I'm making sure to be very wary of lifestyle creep. Would love to hear some of your opinions on this situation. Thank you all!",1,1736803421.0,FinancialPlanning,4,1.0,False

1i0p1gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1i0p1gy/mostly_protein_powders_for_3_months/,Mostly protein powders for 3- months ? ,"Hi everyone,

I’m m21, 1.80m and 95kg.
I’m a student and money is becoming an issue these days, I’m gonna live in France for 3 months where I’ll roughly have 200€ for food and supplements.

It’s not that much for France, but I planned on loosing a lot of accumulated fat so it’s sort of good timing ( less cash = less food …).

Last time I did an agressive fat loss I’m fairly certain I lost a shit ton of muscle ( strength wise it’s very noticeable).

I’m gonna explain what I plan to do diet-wise, so please feel free to share advice on the matter :) 

I’m aiming for roughly 200g of protein, I’ll be taking some c4 pre-workout because tiredness did not help during my last fat loss and energy drink are too expensive.

Supplement -wise I’d get each day:
1-2 scoops of c4 pre-workout
8 scoops of Amazon protein powder ( the cheapest for me) 
5g of creatine

Solid food wise:
5 eggs 
Some green beans (I’ll aim for 300g) 
200g of oatmeal
300g of yogurt 

Drink-wise:
4-5L of water
2-3 cups of coffee 
500mL of milk 

I’ll probably get some iron supplements from my dr too. 

I’m conscient this may not be a very diverse/ healthy diet, but money will be tight and I don’t want to loose to much muscle.

My question is : what am I missing in my diet ? What is critical for me to add to stay relatively healthy and have energy ? 


Thanks to anyone who can share some info on the matter :) ",1,1736803364.0,naturalbodybuilding,12,0.56,False
1i0p1fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1i0p1fu/i_39f_have_been_crushing_on_my_postman_55m_for/,"I, 39F, have been crushing on my postman, 55M, for around a month. I think my feelings may be reciprocated given his behaviour, is it worth taking the shot?","Hi all! I hope this is allowed on here, it seemed like the most reasonable place to put it, I'm oddly nervous about putting out into the wild for some reason. I'm using a throwaway as a few acquaintances follow my main account. l'm writing on mobile, so please forgive any formatting abnormalities. I'll try to keep this as concise as can as to not end up in an indefinite ramble. TL;DR is at the bottom of the post. 

So, to get into it, my postie has been delivering to my address for approximately 3 years now, and as we are seeing one another almost every single week day, we have gotten quite friendly to one another with playful teasing and bantering. I always find myself anxiously anticipating his confident swagger coming down the street, and when he does knock on the door, I am all cheery around him and him too with his cheeky grin. Over the last couple of months, we have spent longer chatting at the door with more sincere conversation than exclusively our usual back and forth bantering, an example being that his oldest dog recently passed, which led to many condolences and a big hug.

What also may be worth mentioning is that he will often do little favours for me, such as bringing my bin to the back gate or picking up my milk from an earlier delivery and such else. I fondly recall him helping me with crates of groceries from a food shopping delivery that coincided with him doing his rounds. Just little acts of kindness which I find endearing.

As he lives local to me, we will occasionally walk our dogs together if we happen to bump into one another when out and about. This happens maybe around once a week or so. It was here that we ended up on a first name basis. I found out he was single from our chats on our walks together, and I had mentioned I was also somewhat recently out of a not-so-amazing relationship and he offered his consolidation, scoffing at how awful my ex had been. That and him taking the time to check in when I'm looking a bit under the weather, either it be at the door or on our walks, as he's aware of my intermittent ailing mental health, something we've gotten into conversation about on our walks.

At Christmas, we both gifted another a small present and a card, something neither of us had planned together. I believe it was here things began to click for me, though I always harboured a soft spot for him.

What do you think, is it worth taking the chance? Do you think he's interested? I'm not sure what to say to him in order to ask him out, I was thinking perhaps a coffee at a dog friendly pub and see where this may take us, but I'm not sure. I would like to give him the lead on this as not to place him in an uncomfortable situation. I am of the understanding that it will be up to me to make the first move given the position he is in and the risk to his job integrity if he were to initiate. Perhaps it may be better for me to ask if I run into him on a walk.


I have a few concerns surrounding the potential of pursuing what may potentially be coming to fruition.

● - As am in the UK, I am unsure of the legislation Royal Mail may have around pursuing a relationship with someone you deliver to, but as far as I know from what I have researched, there is nothing black and white saying you cannot pursue a relationship.

● - I worry that if my feelings aren't reciprocated or things don't work out, it could have the potential to become quite awkward.

● - I'd also reckon that it is quite invasive of me to be fancying someone as they try to get their work done, and backs him into a corner.

I am conscious of the age gap, but it does not bother me too much, but I cannot speak on his behalf.


TL;DR: I fancy my postman, and I think he likes me back based on his behaviour. We joke around and check in on one another, and occasionally go out on dog walks together if our paths cross, but I worry about it becoming awkward if this is not the case and do not wish to perv on someone just trying to do their job.

When comparing GIA Excellent and Very Good cut diamonds:

* Excellent cuts offer superior brilliance, fire, and scintillation
* About 55% of diamonds are graded Excellent, but 25-30% may underperform
* Excellent cuts generally retain better resale value
* Very Good cuts can be a budget-friendly alternative with decent sparkle
* Expert evaluation is crucial for ensuring true quality in Excellent cuts
* Ultimately, an Excellent cut can significantly enhance a diamond's appearance, but careful scrutiny is essential for a well-informed purchase.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone

# Who is this for?

* Buyers prioritizing maximum brilliance and optical performance
* Those concerned with long-term investment value and resale potential
* Diamond enthusiasts willing to invest in superior cut quality

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious buyers seeking good visual appeal at a lower price point
* Those who don't prioritize the highest cut quality and are open to compromise

# Recommendations for smart buying

1. Don't rely solely on the GIA grade. Use additional tools like ASET or IdealScope images to assess light performance.
2. Consider diamonds with AGS evaluations for a more stringent cut assessment.
3. Compare multiple Excellent cut diamonds side-by-side to appreciate subtle differences.

1. Be willing to pay a moderate premium (e.g., 5-10%) for Excellent over Very Good, but avoid excessive markups.
2. Look beyond the cut grade to factors like table size, crown and pavilion angles, and facet precision.
3. If opting for a Very Good cut, focus on those at the higher end of the grade range.

1. Remember that cut quality affects other aspects like color and clarity appearance, so prioritize accordingly.

# FAQ

Q: Is the difference between Excellent and Very Good cuts noticeable to the naked eye?A: While subtle, an Excellent cut typically offers more sparkle and shine due to better light return.

Q: How does cut grade affect resale value?A: Excellent cuts tend to hold value better due to their superior appearance and desirability.

Q: Can I compromise on color or clarity for an Excellent cut?

A: Yes, prioritizing cut can be wise, but balance all factors within your budget.

Q: Why do different labs have varying cut standards?A: Labs use different methodologies and criteria, with some (like AGS) being more stringent than others.

Q: Are all GIA Excellent cuts truly excellent?A: No, there's variation within the grade. Additional evaluation tools can help identify top performers.



Remember, while cut grade is crucial, it's just one factor in choosing a diamond. Consider your priorities, budget, and the specific characteristics of each stone when making your decision.

1i0ow79,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompilerError/comments/1i0ow79/why_haskell_language_is_not_popular/,Why Haskell language is not popular!,"Ah, Haskell. The programming language that is as beautiful as it is baffling, as elegant as it is intimidating, and as pure as the concept of a “perfectly functional” world... but, like a kaleidoscope made of recursive functions, it's a little too complex for most people to enjoy without getting dizzy. So, why isn’t Haskell more popular? Well, let’s take a journey through the world of Haskell’s beauty and its debilitating effects on the unsuspecting mind.

First, let’s talk about the beauty. Imagine a world where every function is pure. Not in the sense of ""pure"" like a clean, wholesome morning coffee, but in the mathematical sense: no side effects. Everything you do in Haskell is like a pristine snowflake. You pass data around, you transform it, and you can rest assured that nothing will reach out from the ether and mutate it without warning. Oh, what a beautiful world! Functions are like snowflakes, each one gliding through your program, no unexpected changes lurking beneath them like that one friend who shows up to the party and immediately breaks the Wi-Fi router.

But here’s where things get spicy. Haskell isn't just about purity. Oh no, it also happens to have a type system that is so advanced, it makes other programming languages look like they’re still stuck in middle school. It’s like attending an exclusive club where the bouncer doesn't just check your ID—he checks your entire life’s history, your ancestors, your future choices, and, just for fun, asks you a philosophical question about the nature of identity.

And then there’s \*\*laziness\*\*—not in the ""I can’t get off the couch"" sense, but in the sense that Haskell evaluates expressions \*only when it needs to\*. You think you're asking for one thing, but Haskell’s like, “Hold on, I’m not going to compute that until I absolutely, positively need to."" This is like asking your friend to fetch you a glass of water, and they say, “I’ll only do it when I see that you really want it and when the universe aligns with the will of your deepest desires.” And you're like, ""I just wanted some water!""

And let’s not forget \*\*monads\*\*. Monads are the great, mystical force of Haskell. If you’ve never heard of monads, let me just say this: they’re like the \*spaghetti\* of programming. At first, you think it’s just some cool, tidy little container for data. You’re excited. You’ve got your spaghetti. But then it’s like, ""Oh, wait, you need to understand category theory to truly get why these little strands of noodles are arranged in such a complex pattern."" So now you’re sitting there, clutching a plate of spaghetti, desperately Googling “what is a monad?” while your brain slowly spirals into existential despair.

But why isn’t Haskell more popular? Well, that’s where the debilitating effects kick in. You see, Haskell’s beauty is so overwhelming that it doesn’t just \*impress\* you—it \*\*terrifies\*\* you. It’s like falling in love with a beautiful, intelligent person, only to realize that you’ll never, ever understand their deepest thoughts. You’re constantly trying to catch up with Haskell, trying to decipher its mind-bending type signatures, but every time you think you’re getting it, it throws you a curveball. It's like learning to swim, but the pool is made of liquid logic and every time you touch the water, it asks you an algebraic question.

And don’t even get me started on Haskell’s \*syntax\*. It's like a cryptic poem written by a software wizard who's been living on top of a mountain for 50 years and only speaks in ancient, mysterious code. You’re over there, typing your code and thinking, “Yes! I’m finally getting it!” and then \*bam\*, Haskell smacks you with a compiler error that is so vague, it’s like a riddle wrapped in an enigma, dipped in confusion sauce. And you’ll look at it and think, “Maybe I should just switch to Python. I’m pretty sure Python wouldn’t make me feel like this.”

Now, let’s not forget that the rest of the world doesn’t quite understand your newfound love affair with Haskell. You proudly tell your friends, “I wrote my program in Haskell,” and they stare at you like you’ve just confessed you’ve been communicating with aliens via quantum entanglement. They’ll give you that polite, but confused, nod, and then ask, “But can you use it to make a website?” And you, dear Haskell enthusiast, will have to admit, ""Well… you could, but it’s... complicated."" And that’s when you realize—\*this\* is why Haskell isn't popular.

In conclusion, Haskell is like the \*Michelangelo’s David\* of programming languages: a thing of undeniable beauty and perfection, yet so intimidating that most people would rather admire it from afar than try to carve their own version. It’s the language that makes you feel enlightened \*and\* inadequate at the same time, like you’ve just ascended to the highest level of enlightenment only to realize that you left your groceries at the bottom of the mountain.

So, Haskell: It’s perfect. It’s brilliant. It’s everything you’ve ever wanted in a language... if you can survive the emotional rollercoaster.",1,1736802994.0,CompilerError,0,1.0,False

Those go in a stainless steel covered pan made for the purpose of lowering into a 6-quart Presto stainless-steel pressure cooker.  Once pressure is reached, I set a timer for 15 minutes.  When done I release the pressure and spoon the cooked apples into a large jar that is air cooled for a bit then put in the fridge.  

I don't add anything to these apples to pressure cook them.  I typically spoon them on top of cooked oatmeal.

Someone gave me a couple of Pillsbury 9"" frozen pie crusts, so I decided to make apple pie with the cooked apples I keep in the fridge. I wondered about a recipe, apple pie will need sugar, spices, and a thickener added. I reached for Wayne Gisslen's Professional Baking, 4th edition.  I searched out his apple pie formulas, he has several, one of which is for canned apples, and that formula seemed closest to my application.  Here's Gisslen's applie pie filling formula in an abbreviated form:

~~~~

3000 g Canned apples (one No. 10 can)

750 mL Drained juice & water

~~~~

250 mL Cold water

90 g Cornstarch

 or

75 g Modified starch (waxy maize)

~~~~

570 g Sugar

7 g	Salt

7 g	Cinnamon

2 g Nutmeg

90 g Butter

~~~~

I was disappointed to find out that since the filling didn't have flour, Gisslen didn't use percentages and his formula was for an entire #10 can of apples!  I didn't have that many cooked apples, and I only had crust for one pie!  So I converted the weights to percents based on apple weight.  Water-based mL were estmated at 1 g = 1 mL.  

Ingredient weights ÷ cannned apples weight (x 100) = ingredient percents 

~~~~

100% Canned apples (one No. 10 can)

25.0% Drained juice & water

~~~~	

8.33% Cold water

3.00% Cornstarch

 or

2.50% Modified starch (waxy maize)

~~~~	

19.0% Sugar

0.23% Salt

0.23% Cinnamon

0.07% Nutmeg

3.00% Butter

~~~~

I found an empty pie plate the same size as the pie crusts, put in on the scale and I spooned my cooked apples into it, as many apples as I thought I would want in the pie, that measured 700 g.  Therefore, 

700 g x ingredient percents = ingredient weights

 (I typically end up having to do a little rounding).

~~~~

700 g Canned apples (one No. 10 can)

175 g Drained juice & water

~~~~	

58.3 g Cold water

21.0 g Cornstarch

 or

17.5 g Modified starch (waxy maize)

~~~~

133 g Sugar

1.63 g Salt

1.63 g Cinnamon

0.467 g Nutmeg

21.0 g Butter

~~~~

One more problem, my pressure-cooked apples don't have much juice! For the formula's juice I used 75% water + 25% frozen apple juice concentrate. 

175 g x 75% = 131.25 g which I rounded to 131 g of water

175 g x 25% = 43.75 g which I rounded to 44 g of apple juice concentrate

Mix the water and apple juice concentrate together.  Reserve the weighed apples in a bowl.  Mix the cornstarch slurry and set it aside.  In a pan put the juice, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter, and brought to boil, then slowly added the cornstarch slurry and stirred with a whip until it thickened, which took a little while to reheat.  Once thickened, I turned off the flame and added the cold apples and stirred.  IMO the mixture was still a little warm to put in the pie crusts, so I placed the covered pan of apple pie filling in an icebath for about half an hour.

I spooned the cold mixture into the frozen crusts, waited 20 minutes for the top crust to defrost, pinched the top and bottom crusts together, and baked in a preheated oven at 425 °F for 30 minutes.  When the timer rang I looked at it, the filling was boiling and bubbling and the crust was a nice golden brown. I turned off the oven and let it cool for a little more than 4 hours before having some slices for dessert.

I don’t drink tea or coffee either, so I’m basically going from caffeinated fizzy drinks and some water to literally JUST water…and the occasional bit of squash but tiny tiny amounts because again I’m worried about the acid.

I can’t just have it at meal times, because I know myself and it WILL turn into more frequent sipping. I just have no control, or I forget why I cut down in the first place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your kitchen into an efficient space can make cooking and meal preparation much more enjoyable. Instead of searching for utensils, ingredients, or cookware, you'll know exactly where everything is. Below are effective strategies to help you organize your home kitchen for maximum efficiency.

### Assess Your Kitchen Space

Start by evaluating your kitchen layout. Look at the work zones—prep, cooking, and cleaning. This will help you understand where you spend the most time and what items you frequently use. Once you have a clear picture, identify any clutter that doesn't belong in those areas. A good kitchen organization system will maximize functionality.

### Declutter Regularly

Getting rid of items you no longer use or need is crucial. Here’s how you can declutter your kitchen:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
- **Initiate a Purge:** Grab a box and start tossing anything that is expired, broken, or just not used.
- **Limit Duplicates:** If you have multiples of the same item, consider keeping one or two and donating the rest.
- **Evaluate Gadgets:** Carefully assess kitchen gadgets. If you haven’t used it in the last year, it’s time to reconsider keeping it.

### Utilize Storage Solutions

Having adequate storage is the key to an organized kitchen. Evaluate your kitchen’s vertical and horizontal spaces and use them effectively:

- **Cabinets:** Use shelf risers in cabinets to create more space for plates and bowls.
- **Drawers:** Invest in drawer dividers to keep utensils, measuring cups, and other small items organized.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Install magnetic strips on the wall for spices or knives. This saves space and keeps frequently used items within reach.
- **Pots and Pans:** Consider hanging pots and pans from a rack. This not only frees up cabinet space but also adds a rustic touch to your kitchen.

### Group Similar Items Together

Grouping like items can save you time and effort. Organize your kitchen based on usage:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
- **Cooking Essentials:** Keep oils, spices, and frequently used cookware near the stove.
- **Baking Supplies:** Create a designated spot for baking items like flour, sugar, and pans.
- **Cutlery and Utensils:** Arrange these in a top drawer or container near the prep area to have quick access while cooking.

### Label Everything

Labels help everyone in the household know where things belong. Use clear labels on jars, shelves, and containers. This will not only streamline your access to items but also maintain the organization over time. You can use a label maker or simple adhesive labels to keep it easy.

### Make Use of Counter Space Wisely

Counter space is often limited, so utilize it efficiently. Here are a few tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
- **Appliance Arrangement:** Store away appliances that you use infrequently. Only keep daily-use items like the coffee maker and toaster out on the counter.
- **Use a Tray:** Place frequently used items on a tray for a neat appearance. This makes it easy to clear the counter when not in use.

### Create Your Cooking Zone

Establish designated zones within your kitchen. This will help you work faster and with less frustration:

- **Prep Zone:** Ensure that cutting boards, knives, and measuring tools are easily accessible in this area.
- **Cooking Zone:** Store pots, pans, and oven mitts near the stove for a seamless cooking experience.
- **Cleaning Zone:** Keep your dish soap, sponges, and towels close to the sink.

### Regularly Revisit Your Organization System

Once your kitchen is organized, don’t forget to maintain it. Set a schedule to revisit your organization every few months. This helps reinforce good habits and keeps clutter at bay.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
By implementing these strategies, you can create a home kitchen that is not only organized but also promotes maximum efficiency. The less time you spend searching for items, the more time you can dedicate to enjoying your cooking and baking experiences.

Tips for Maintaining an Organized Kitchen Space Long-term
---------------------------------------------------------

Keeping your kitchen organized is not just a one-time project; it requires ongoing effort and smart strategies. An organized kitchen can save you time, stress, and make cooking more enjoyable. Here are some practical tips for maintaining an organized kitchen space for the long haul.

### Start with a Clean Slate

Before you can maintain an organized kitchen, you need to start fresh. Clear everything off the counters and give the entire space a deep clean. This not only provides a clear area to work on but also reveals spaces you may have forgotten to organize. Once clean, consider which items truly belong in the kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
### Declutter Regularly

Decluttering is crucial for an organized kitchen. Remove items that you don’t use frequently. Consider these tips:

- **Check expiration dates:** Go through your pantry and refrigerator regularly. Dispose of expired food products to create more space.
- **Assess utensils:** Examine your utensils, pots, and pans. If you haven’t used it in a year, it may be time to let it go.
- **Limit duplicates:** Having multiple cutting boards or measuring cups can create clutter. Keep only what you need.

### Designate Specific Zones

Once you’ve decluttered, it’s time to think about how to organize the remaining items. Divide your kitchen into zones based on the tasks you do most often:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
- **Cooking Zone:** This area should house pots, pans, spatulas, and utensils. Keep frequently used items within reach.
- **Prep Zone:** Position cutting boards and knives within arm’s reach of the cooking zone. Consider including your favorite seasonings nearby.
- **Cleaning Zone:** Store dish soaps, sponges, and towels close to the sink for easy access.

### Maximize Storage Space

In many homes, kitchen storage can be limited. Make the most of what you have:

- **Use vertical space:** Install shelves, pegboards, or racks to make use of vertical areas. Hanging pots or pans can also save cabinet space.
- **Drawer organizers:** Utilize drawer dividers to keep utensils sorted. This prevents clutter from building up in drawers.
- **Clear containers:** Store dry goods such as pasta, cereal, or grains in clear containers. This makes it easy to see what you have at a glance.

### Create a Maintenance Schedule

To keep your kitchen in shape, establish a regular maintenance schedule. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
- **Daily:** Wipe down surfaces and put away items after each meal. Complete the dishes to prevent pile-up.
- **Weekly:** Spend 15-30 minutes organizing drawers and cabinets. Make this a part of your cleaning routine.
- **Monthly:** Review pantry items, check expiration dates, and take a second look at any clutter that may have built up.

### Incorporate a “One In, One Out” Rule

This concept is simple yet effective. Every time you bring a new item into your kitchen, like a new gadget or dishware, let go of an old one. This practice not only prevents clutter but also helps you think critically about what you truly need.

### Engage the Family

Encourage everyone in your household to contribute to keeping the kitchen organized. Assign tasks to family members, such as loading the dishwasher or organizing the pantry. Make it a team effort, and it will feel less like a chore. Plus, it helps everyone appreciate a clean kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/organize-home-kitchen  
  
### Stay Inspired

Finding new ways to organize your kitchen can be exciting. Regularly check out organizing blogs, social media accounts, or even magazines for inspiration. This can give you fresh ideas and help you stay motivated to maintain your organized spaces.

By applying these strategies, you can create a kitchen that remains organized and functional. A clutter-free kitchen not only enhances your cooking experience but also makes your space much more enjoyable to be in. Keep the effort consistent, and you’ll find organizing your home kitchen to be a rewarding endeavor.

### Conclusion

A well-organized kitchen can transform your cooking experience, making it more enjoyable and efficient. Implementing effective strategies to organize your home kitchen is the first step toward achieving this goal. Start by decluttering your space and adopting a system that places similar items together. Utilize drawer dividers, shelf risers, and labeled containers to maximize your storage. Remember to keep frequently used utensils and ingredients easily accessible.

I barely get any income now because so many have left this app because of the backwards business model and practices.

And people don’t tip because they know it’s only a matter of time before people stop using these delivery apps.

The app and business model is designed to try and sign you up for their DashPass subscription without you knowing - I've never signed up for the subscription ever, but I would constantly be charged for it and only find out later when I was checking my statements. Then they say ""well you used the benefit.""

Never did. Never signed up. You don't need to. It's just like Amazon, you don't need these subscriptions. You just need to meet the minimum order requirements. But, they hate that people are wise to that trick. They need to live off the l@$er$ who order a single coffee delivered and who don't care about wasting money. They are vultures.

Unbelievably rude staff every time, even when I'm going above and beyond to be polite knowing how difficult it is to work in a call center. I can't imagine the low pay these call center staff get, and I'm sure they have many options to go to, so I get it - that's why I'm always nice. That's why I always tipped the drivers a fair rate too. But, I also realized that this is a crazy new luxury to be able to order delivery from anywhere, which is always why I used it responsibly. But these companies are scamming both you and the businesses they deliver from.

I have a list of evidence showing that I never signed up for DashPass, yet time and time again they would have me signed up and charging me per month without my knowledge.

Just delete this s\*@m app. You need to take your ass outside to the stores and restaurants anyway.

I only ever downloaded it for when I was traveling or after I sold my car, and to have an option to see better deals outside of Uber Eats. Now, I realized even then I rarely use these s\*@m food delivery apps, and this one takes the CAKE with how shady they are.

For a LONG time now, I have only ever ordered pick up from area businesses that I can travel to myself, or I dine in, or I make food at home. This is the way it should be.

I am in a stable, decently paid job at Amazon Web Services.  I’ve been here since fall 2023, after taking a few months off post grad (spring 2023 from an Ivy League, I was Magna Cum Laude and graduated with a 3.9 gpa, honors and all that jazz). I applied to this job as an internship when I was just a junior in college and didn’t really know what I wanted to do (still don’t), got the internship summer 2022, got a return offer for 2023, and have been there since.  

I think the real root of the problem is that I am lazy and depressed. But then again, I think about it, and when I am doing something I love (writing, making music, reading, what have you), I could spend hours doing it with no effort at all, so I do think I could put effort into doing some kind of work if it felt meaningful and rewarding to me. 

My job right now is non technical and very ambiguous, and doesn’t have a lot of specific stuff for me to be doing on the daily. I have a lot of free time- that is, until I am forced to go into office 5 days a week come March. When this happens, I will be commuting 2+ hours per day. I feel like now is crunch time for me to find another job. However, my job is so easy, my work life balance is so great, my boss has my back, I have a co worker who I consider a friend. So why am I so miserable? Yes, my other co workers aren’t the best, and my boss is super frustrating and confusing at times, but I can pretty much skate by doing jack shit and getting praised for doing the bare minimum, though I haven’t felt like I’ve put one ounce of brain power into this job — I still feel like I might get a promotion by EOY (lol). Like seriously, what is there to complain about in the grand scheme of things?

Still, I wake up numb, wanting to writhe around and would sometimes rather die than “log on.” It feels so dumb. However, my job feels fake and irrelevant and I know I can amount to more than this. I feel trapped in this cushy job, and to quit would feel dumb. I have applied to so many jobs (yes, similar positions, maybe that’s a bad idea but it’s all I’m qualified for as a recent grad) to no avail. 60+ rejections. I have a 3.9 GPA from an Ivy League school. I feel like Amazon has trapped me. I want out. 

I do care about salary. All I need is to make similar to what I make now (~85k, I could see myself going down to 75 or 65 for a job that I might actually enjoy). Maybe that’s selfish, but I live in an expensive city and need to pay rent. Maybe I can let go of that idea. It’s not so firm, and I am in a financially privileged state where I could ask my parents for money and have some saved up/invested. 

My true passion in this world, I think, is music. I am a musician at heart. I don’t know how to begin to get involved in that world. I don’t see myself being a true 24/7 creative, relying on gigs or being famous. I am not sure what route there is for me in this world. 

My job for 1.5 years has not given me any technical or transferable skills that I can take with me and use for future endeavors. 

Another idea I had was taking the GMAT and just full sending the business school route - I am lucky to be in a place where my parents could fund this for me. I took a mini practice GRE and got a perfect score. I’m really good at standardized testing and honestly enjoy it and I think studying could actually give me some purpose right now. But with that said, do I want to do that? I foresee guilt in doing it as a cop out scenario. 

Anyway, that’s my rant. I don’t even know what I’m asking here. I guess, what should I do? I have basically learned the hard way that I am stuck at my job until I make some real moves, and I barely have the energy to make those moves. But I am trying. I apply to jobs, I go on networking coffee chats, I research the job market, other industries, schools.

Teddy dated my best friend Clair F18 for two months sophomore year. He was fun but ultimately they were better friends than dating.

Now Teddy has a girlfriend. Let me be very clear, I am not trying to get in the way of their relationship I just need help on ending this crush. 

Teddy is very very flirty. He has a flirty personality. He’s very touchy, (lots of hugs, grabs me to get around, just never shy about touch) and it’s never been an issue between us before because there is an underlying knowledge that we will never be more than friends.

We have a secret handshake, we give long hugs pre and post shift. We talk about everything. Nothing is really off limits. He’s my favorite person to see at work

I didn’t realize I had a crush until I saw my own jealousy.
I saw him at a coffee shop with his girlfriend and i genuinely had a sense of hurt. Clair also just started working with us so they work together once a week alone.
And I came at the end of a  shift they had together. Just watching them together laughing and everyone smiling also made me kinda upset.  Not mad upset just kinda hurt.


I know I’m delusional I’m just stuck in this crush and I don’t know how to fix it because he’s a great guy. 

He loves his girlfriend but he also tells me that they have to break up when she goes to college(long story)

1i0o4wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1i0o4wu/are_my_expectations_wrong/,Are my expectations wrong?,"A little background. I am new to the AeroPress and have been brewing with it for just a little over a month. Prior to using the AeroPress, I have just used an automatic drip brewing machine at home. About a year ago I bought a coffee grinder to try whole bean coffee versus pre-ground. 

Recently, I was out to dinner at a local restaurant while traveling for work and decided to have coffee with my dessert after a meal. That cup of coffee was literally the best-tasting cup of coffee I had ever had. So I asked what coffee they used. I was shocked and surprised when they told me it was Wellsley Farms Colombian Supremo. 

I found it at BJ's Wholesale and bought a bag to try and re-create that same cup of coffee at home. I have no idea what the restaurant used to brew their coffee (I should have asked). Anyway, this lead be down a rabbit hole of trying different grind sizes and the amount of coffee used in my automatic drip brewing machine. Those are pretty much the only two variables I can control with that machine.

I came across a YouTube video showing the AeroPress and all the different recipes and things you can try to tweak your brewing method. I thought I would give it a try in my quest to re-create that cup of coffee from the restaurant. 

So far I don't feel like I am having much luck with the AeroPress and not quite sure what I am doing wrong. Here is a list of things I have tried thus far:

* Grind size (I have used course, medium, medium-fine) and some variations in between those.
* Water temp (Purchased an electric kettle so that I could dial in a specific temp). I have tried 80C - 100C in 5C increments.
* Coffee to water ratio 1:5 - 1:25
* Steep times of 90s to 5m

I have not tried the inverted method yet. plunge times have been about 30s to 45s. 

This is my question: so far, with everything I have tried, I can taste differences in things that I have changed. But each brew seems to sure out more or less on the watered down size compared to my automatic drip brewer. Almost more tea like, if that makes any sense. I feel like it's lacking in being I guess more full-bodied. I am not even sure if I am using the correct terminology to describe what I am getting.

I am beginning to wonder if that is just how the AeroPress results are and my expectations are wrong? Some of the brews I feel like I am close to achieving what I am looking for in that most of the time my automatic brewer results in a bit of bitterness. But it feels like the brew is more full bodied. Where as with the AeroPress I can get results that do not have that bitterness but I feel like the result is lacking in that it's more tea like or thin. Almost watered down.

Here is one observation I have started to notice, Right before I plunge, it seems like all the grounds are floating at the top of the water. I have tried swirling the AeroPress to try and get the ground to settle before plunging, but it doesn't appear to help. Some of the coffee grinds will settle, but the majority are still floating at the top of the water. Not sure if this is causing the result to be more tea like or thin? Is there a better way to get the grinds to settle? 

At this point, I am not as focused on producing that cup from the restaurant. I am just trying to improve my brewing method with AeroPress to try and achive something that is more full-bodied and on the richer side.

But I just want to make sure that my expectations of what is possible with the AeroPress can be achieved or should I start looking at another brewing method, such as a pour-over?",2,1736801123.0,AeroPress,5,1.0,False

Vanderbilt, an aristocrat, had a ticket to board the ill-fated ocean liner Titanic in 1912, but he canceled his trip. Three years later, in 1915, he perished in the sinking of the Lusitania; there is an urban legend concerning a stoker named Frank ""Lucks"" Towers, who survived all three sinking of the ocean liners Titanic, Lusitania, and the Empress of Ireland in 1914; Winston Churchill said that on one of his frequent car rides in London in World War II, an inner voice told him to avoid sitting in his usual seat in his car one day, and thus he avoided death when a bomb dropped next to that side of the car; William T. Stead, a psychic who perished in the sinking of Titanic, is also rumored to have had premonitions; and Adolf Hitler claimed that when he was a young soldier at World War (1914-1918), one day he was looking a place to sit down in a trench with his fellow soldiers when a voice almost literately ""pulled him"" off the place to sit down in the opposite side of it.

Abraham High, and Carter Horton's car had a license plate beginning with the letters ""RFK"". The plane takes off from ""JFK"" Airport. JFK (John F. Kennedy) also was assassinated.

Flight 180 has been confirmed to be loosely based on the real life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred on July 17, 1996 near East Moriches, New York en route to Rome, with a stopover in Paris, with high school students and had also experienced an in-flight explosion due to a spark igniting the Center Wing Track. Critic Roger Ebert, who praised the film, called this allusion ""a bit tasteless"". Jeffrey Reddick has since debunked this. The aircraft was a 25-year-old Boeing 747-131, built in 1971, initially ordered by Eastern Airlines, but purchased by Trans Word Airlines as brand new and registered as N93119 after Eastern cancelled its orders for the 747. Trans World Airlines is identified as Boeing Customer 31, and the aircraft is a -100 series, thus ""-131"". It is also loosely based on the crash of Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747-121 (Clipper Maid Of The Seas) in December 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Many of the passengers were thrown out of the plane and fell to their deaths. Also, several people on the ground were also killed due to parts of the aircraft crashing to the ground. United Airlines Flight 811, a Boeing 747-122 also experienced an accident similar to this, however the aircraft did not explode and landed safely, with a gaping hole in the right side of fuselage section 42, which was caused when the forward cargo door blew off. The door swung out with such force that it passed its normal stop and slammed into the side of the fuselage, bursting the fuselage open. Pressure differentials and aerodynamic forces caused the cabin floor to cave in, and ten seats (G and H of rows 8 through 12) were ejected from the cabin. All eight passengers seated in these locations were killed (seats 8G and 12G were unoccupied), as was the passenger in seat 9F.

The film was released 4 months before Air France Flight 4590 was crashed, along with Singapore Airlines Flight 006 7 months prior. If the film was released after these crashes involved, it could result into 747 aborting departure, and canceling the flight itself, which is originally planned to use N611US, a ex-Northwest 747-200B that was supposed to be in the film.

The original plan was to have Death as a much more obvious entity in the film as it was in Tod's death (with Tod seeing a shadow in the mirror and the water running back into the toilet to ""cover its tracks""). After Tod's death it was decided to have the deaths look like rare accidents. This way to kill the Flight 180 survivors pays tribute to The Omen (1976): in it, also rare accidents happen around Robert Thorn and his son Damien.

Essential Tips for Enjoying a Solo Trip: Safety, Budgeting, and Self-Discovery
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traveling alone can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. It opens up opportunities for self-discovery, personal growth, and unforgettable adventures. Here are some essential tips to help you make the most of your solo trip, focusing on safety, budgeting, and personal exploration.

### Prioritize Your Safety

Your safety should always come first when you travel alone. Here are some effective strategies to keep you secure:

- **Research Your Destination:** Before setting out, learn about the area you’ll be traveling to, focusing on the safety of neighborhoods, transportation options, and emergency contacts.
- **Stay Connected:** Share your itinerary with a friend or family member. Regular check-ins can offer peace of mind and ensure someone knows where you are.
- **Keep Valuables Safe:** Use a money belt or anti-theft backpack. This prevents pickpocketing and keeps your money, passport, and other critical items secure.
- **Trust Your Instincts:** If something feels off, leave the area or change your plans. Your intuition is a powerful tool.

### Budgeting for Your Trip

Managing your finances carefully will enhance your travel experience. Here are some budgeting tips for your solo adventure:

- **Create a Detailed Budget:** Outline your daily expenses, including accommodation, food, transportation, and activities. This will help you stay on track.
- **Consider Accommodation Options:** Hostels and budget hotels can be ideal for solo travelers. They often offer communal areas that encourage meeting new people.
- **Use Public Transportation:** Instead of taxis or rideshares, utilize buses and trains. They are often more affordable and offer a more authentic experience.
- **Eat Like a Local:** Street food and local markets are not only economical but also a fantastic way to enjoy the locale’s culture. Try to eat where the locals eat!

### Cultivating Self-Discovery

Traveling alone is a perfect chance to gain insights about yourself. Engage fully in this personal journey with these practices:

- **Keep a Travel Journal:** Documenting your thoughts, feelings, and experiences can help you reflect on your journey and track your personal growth.
- **Explore Mindfully:** Instead of rushing to see as many sights as possible, take the time to truly immerse yourself in each experience. This could mean sitting in a park, joining a local class, or participating in a workshop.
- **Challenge Yourself:** Engage in activities that push you out of your comfort zone, whether it’s trying adventure sports, speaking with locals, or navigating public transport.
- **Embrace Solitude:** Spending time alone can be incredibly beneficial. Use moments of solitude for reflection, meditation, or simply enjoying nature, allowing you to reclaim your thoughts and emotions.

### Stay Flexible and Open

One of the beautiful aspects of traveling alone is the freedom to plan as you go. While it's great to have an itinerary, allow yourself some flexibility:

- **Be Open to Change:** Embrace unexpected opportunities. If you hear about a local event or a scenic spot from a fellow traveler, don’t hesitate to adjust your plans!
- **Meet New People:** Engage with other travelers and locals. This will not only enrich your experience but may lead to lasting friendships.
- **Practice Patience:** Travel can come with hiccups; delays and missed connections happen. Use these moments to practice patience and adaptability.

Ultimately, traveling alone is a fantastic way to grow and learn about the world—and yourself. Prioritizing safety, managing your budget wisely, and allowing room for both personal reflection and spontaneity will transform your solo trip into an enriching adventure. Each journey is unique, so discover what works best for you as you embark on this exciting path of self-discovery.

### Conclusion

Traveling alone can be an incredibly rewarding experience, allowing you to explore new places at your own pace and discover more about yourself. The best places to travel alone in the US offer a variety of environments, from bustling cities to serene nature spots, ensuring there's something that caters to every solo adventurer's taste. Whether you choose the vibrant streets of New Orleans, the majestic landscapes of the Grand Canyon, or the coastal charm of Charleston, each destination provides unique experiences that encourage personal growth and connection.

As you embark on your solo journey, remember that safety should always be a priority. Keep your belongings secure and stay aware of your surroundings. Budgeting wisely can enhance your trip, allowing you to immerse yourself in activities that interest you without financial stress. Many solo travelers discover joy in meeting new people, sharing stories, and learning from diverse cultures. Engaging with locals can make your trip even more memorable.

Ultimately, a solo trip is not just about visiting new places; it’s about embracing the freedom to explore the unknown.

We had our machine hooked up at our previous apartment. (I can elaborate on how if needed)

We moved into our new home and after \~3 weeks (unpacking, adding 240 outlet, etc.) finally set everything back up.

Now the speed/flow of a pull is abysmal, even after going down to only 15g of grounds  
(Edit: at 15g we can actually get a shot out of it, it just takes \~1.5-2x longer to do)

I haven't had a chance to really look at the machine yet, and won't for a couple more weeks at least, so in the meantime wanted to try and get any insights as to what the likely culprit(s) might be. Anything and everything is appreciated! (We're in the US btw)

Some more detail:

\- Issue is with both groups

\- For the coffee we've been getting we originally determined our ideal grind setting and a weight range of 17 to 17.8 grams. Now these same settings result in almost now flow whatsoever, barely dripping anything at all even after 20 seconds

\- The gauge appears to read the same brew pressure however I do know it needs some maintenance as it reads high and has lost practically all dampening (pulses with the pump way more than it should)

\- As best I can describe it the pump ""sounds better"" than it did at the last place by a little bit? Not that it sounded BAD at the last place, at least considering the machine's age and the fact I know that building didn't have the 'cleanest' power (electrical noise) and this home seems to not have that issue.

\- The relief sides of the 3 way valves are capped off atm as the would sometimes leak (seems simple, just need to find the time to fix that) so I know there is 0% chance of pressure leaking out there

\- Last thing I can tell is different is the water pressure where it's hooked up is slightly lower. I seriously doubt this is impacting anything, but want to include as much information as I can",2,1736800573.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Please don't be too rude when you say this itinerary is not realistic though haha. A little background: I will be travelling with my wife (in our 30s) with two kids (ages 3 and 5) and my parents (in their 60s). We like to be on the go, but will take some time to just relax at these amazing beaches too. We are going in late April for four full days and staying in Kihei. I am not including restaurants on here but will plan on eating out for dinners if not more. The kids are picky eaters and rest of family are not fans of seafood, but any restaurant recommendations are appreciated!

Day 1: \~12 hour flight, arrive at 1230PM, jet lagged (coming from eastern standard time). Pick up rental car, get something to eat as it will be 1830PM my time, pickup groceries for breakfasts and lunches at Costco, check into AirBnB and maybe relax at Charley Young beach (within walking distance).

Day 2 - Road to Hana (take advantage of early wake up time)

* Grab some food from Hana Picnic Lunch Company (anything open earlier than 0700?)
* Ho'okipa Lookout
* Check out the Waikamoi Falls (skipping the nearby trail)
* Ke'anae Peninsula Side trip (Aunty Sandy Banana Bread)
* Upper Waikani Falls (view from car or park and walk back)
* Nahiku Marketplace (coffee, snacks)
* Pipiwai Trail (hopefully arrive by 11 and complete hike by 1300-1400ish)
* Kids will likely fall asleep in the car by then, might try to stop at Wai'anapanapa State Park if everyone is up for it (1500-1800 reservation), I just want to see the black sand beach

Any other stops you would recommend instead, the only must do is Pipiwai Trail (yes, our kids have hiked before)?

Day 3 - West Maui (beaches!!)

* Nakalele Point: Nakalele Lighthouse Trail & Nakalele Blowhole (\~70 min drive)
* Makaluapuna Point
   * a. Dragon's Teeth Trail to Makaluapuna Point
   * b. Napili Bay Beach or Kapalua Bay & Beach
* Ka'anapali Area
   * a. Ka'anapali Beach & Blackrock
   * b. Whaler's Village Dining & Shops
* Optional
   * a. Launiupoko Beach & State Park
   * b. Kahekili Beach Park

Day 4 - Haleakala National Park

* Reservation for sunrise, still taking advantage of early wake-up times
* Overlooks (Leleiwi, Kalahaku)
* Sliding Sands Trail (hike \~2-3 miles before turning around)
* Check out surfing goat dairy afterwards on the way back to the AirBnB
* Nap at AirBnB/relax at Charley Young Beach

Day 5 - South Maui OR Central/North Maui

* Option A
   * Kamaole Beach Park I
   * Makena Beach
   * Hoapili Trail
   * Ahihi-Kinau Marine Reserve
* Option B
   * 'Iao Valley State Park
   * Maui Pineapple Tour (must-do for the Wife)
   * Recommended beach?

Unfortunately, none of that is true (well, almost none of it anyway 😉).  My journey with Twos is so new, it wouldn't fill out a ""Future Twoser"" onesie! That being said, after my wife dozed off one night in early December and I was fueled by a steady drip of Cameron's Jamaican Blend, I opened up the laptop and began my semi-regular descent into the rabbit hole of productivity and note taking apps....heavily afflicted with *shiny new app syndrome.*

This journey begins on, of all places, a Canadian blog ran by a guy named ""Stone"" that has an affinity for android apps.  Almost three years ago, he published a [piece ](https://www.noteapps.ca/twos/)about an app I'd never heard of, which is remarkable given my preference for all things shiny and new: Twos.  As I resisted the urge to save this article to my favorite read-it-later wormhole, it was evident to me in the first few paragraphs that I'd somehow missed the boat and I couldn't quite comprehend how this had possibly escaped my frontal lobes for so long.  I knew within a paragraph or two that I had to check this app out and that's exactly what I did and what I've been daily-driving for the last month or so.  It is, simply put, a remarkable piece of software that has been a saving grace for my app addiction.  Have I gotten rid of everything else yet?  Are you kidding me?  Nope, but I have stopped drinking coffee at 10pm and 'snipe hunting' the latest and greatest and biggest and best new thing to fly out of the Hacker News forum, which has been a keystroke in the right direction. It's been a fun and inspired journey so far and this is only the beginning!

1i0nmtg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0nmtg,2.2 Update and representation of Brazil.,"Hello, firstly I myself am brazilian and play the game. I don't wish to adress this more times, but will do if needed. I've seen many people upset with this update, and I'll try to summarize what's wrong with it.
Firstly, the Chapter Story: Tristes Tropiques is supposed to be located in São Paulo. But as you can see in the trailer, there's an area with a body of water (a lake, maybe?) If you've ever been to São Paulo, the capital, you must know that there isn't any beach in the city. Though, the STATE of Sao Paulo has: it's located in a city called Santos, but it's FAR (hours distance) from the capital.

Second, Bluepoch always does an amazing job with representation, but it seems like Brazil isn't included in that, right? We're all fun and games, pretty culture and everything until they actually need to study our history to not f**k it up... Or maybe just visiting would have done the trick. But no, we ain't worthy of being ""noble"" or ""beautiful"" like european and north american cultures! We ain't worthy of study, of care! 
Tristes Tropiques is set in the 1990s when Brasil had just scaped from a MILITARY dictatorship government that killed and abused our population. Taking the story and putting the military as center of it without mentioning this dark past is disgusting and disrespectful. 21 years in the dark for a game to ignore and throw it on the trash? 
Look, I was really enjoying the game, I've grown found of it, even. But the disrespect is a very plausible reason for me to just quit it, or even just be upset and angry. I'm talking here today cause I really love the game and want this to change.

In chapter 6, Kakania says this, about arcanists: ""We are exiled and marginalized. Our only voice in the culture is to be DECORATION, because decoration impacts nothing."" 
Isn't that something like Bluepoch made with this patch? It's pretty to put our language, our cities, our culture on the game, but to be true to it? That's another case.

They even insulted us with those daily rewards... Saying our coffee beans smell bad, mind you... Our coffee is sold all around the world, we are the top 2 producer of coffee globally. The rest os the rewards didn't even mention anything brazilian, just put maracas and other stuff unrelated to us. No use googling a little, i guess.

Third, what even is this tweet? We know that we ain't the safest country, but tbh, São Paulo is safer than most of USA's cities... Reducing us to gangs just tarnishes our reputation and reduces us to vile people. Of course, there IS violence, but so does the majority of cities... Why would we be so different? Is it because we ain't from Europe?

Y'all probably know the issues with Mrs Duncan already, so I'll just leave it. But him being the only brazilian and not even actually having a Brazilian appearance or accent makes me upset too. We have many good va's here that speak English... It was just laziness, tbh. Bluepoch doing this just reminds me of Hoyoverse... just makes me so disappointed. 

Y'all can attack me or anything, but if you aren't Brazilian, please don't speak on our matters... Just reach out to the company to change this too, and help us. ",0,1736799876.0,Reverse1999,2,0.32,False

My wife and I are celebrating our anniversary at the beginning of February and after a very busy last year we realized we... Didn't plan a thing about this trip.

We're flying to San José and have read the comments about how it's a good jumping off point to travel to other cities. 

My wife and I are food and relaxation people. We have an incredibly loose itinerary set up of spending a full day in San José strictly for the Grand Central market before we venture out to La Fortuna to sit in some hot springs (I saw a post about the Springs having a 2 day pass). We aren't big hikers and too heavy to zip line. 

So I guess the easy walk to the volcano and hot springs will suffice. Maybe a coffee /chocolate tour. 

After a few days we want to go to Manuel Antonio since it seems to have a better pace for us. 

Does anyone have a Airbnb or hotel recommendation that is nicer but won't break the bank. Costa Rica is more Rica than I expected. We have the rental car lined up already and thanks to some previous posts here have the insurance thing worked out. 

Thanks in advance. We're bummed that we're not able to do more of the Caribbean side of it since it seems more appealing culinary wise. I'd love some recommendations for food if you have them to.

Thanks again. ",2,1736799780.0,CostaRicaTravel,3,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I (early 20s) are planning a trip to Ecuador for March and need travel advice. We are adventurous and outdoorsy but not into very dangerous extreme sports. We love hiking, cultural experiences, yoga, animal sightings, etc. and need more ideas of things to do at the locations we’ve picked out. We’d generally prefer to do things outside of pre-planned, paid tours, but of course sometimes it’s worth it! So if you have any tour recommendations, please let me know. 

1. We are planning to fly into Quito and go straight to a yoga cabin in the Mindo cloud forest, then do the 3 waterfall sanctuary hike the next day. We’d also like to walk around Mindo a bit and potentially do a coffee/chocolate tasting. 

2. We’d then head to Cotopaxi. We found a hostel that does airport retrievals, and we were curious if it would be a good idea to go back to the airport after Mindo as I know there are no buses that go straight into Cotopaxi. If you have any other ideas for this let me know. We’re also struggling finding things to do in Cotopaxi, such as a good hike that is not actually summiting Cotopaxi. We don’t need to spend too much time there but would like to get a good hike in, and if there are other cool cultural experiences to do during the day or night, please let me know. 

3. After that we’d like to head to Baños. Here is where we hit a wall- we need some solid recommendations for Baños. I’ve also been reading that it’s imperative to visit Puyo if you’re going to Baños, which we can allot for time wise, but I cannot pinpoint anything to actually do there other that pre-planned jungle tours. Is that it? If so, can someone recommend me one that is worth the money? 

Thanks so much. We originally planned to stay in Ayampe/Montanita as well as the rainforest, as we both surf and love the bohemian vibe, however deemed it was maybe too much to do in one trip and didn’t want to spend the whole time traveling. If you think we should reconsider, let me know, but since cutting it out we are low on the activities list. 

Also, I’m prone to migraines and altitude sickness, and with all of the altitude change within this trip I was wondering if anyone had any tips to alleviate or prevent it. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

Furthermore, we’re aware of the political climate we’re going into, and if you have any safety tips or precautions to be aware of, please let me know. Anything helps.

This is my first time posting, so I'm not sure how much traction this will get, but here goes!

My friends and I are planning to start a ground coffee supply business in the USA. We’re targeting small drive-through coffee shops, beginning in Washington state (specifically Seattle) and Washington, D.C. During our initial scouting, we noticed that the coffee sold by these small shops is slightly more expensive than what's offered by larger chains. We believe that by providing high-quality coffee at lower prices, we can help improve their profit margins.

From our research, we found that many of these shops currently use retail ground coffee brands like Peet’s.

I have a couple of questions for small coffee shop owners, or anyone interested in a consistent coffee subscription:

1. Are there any issues you face with currently available coffee options in the market?
2. Is there anything you wish could be improved throughout the entire process?

I'd love to hear your thoughts, even if they're only loosely related to coffee purchases.

Washed it carefully with hot water (no scrub) 
Then I made my first coffee but I saw something at the top of the brew... Similar to a thin film of fat floating... 

I did not drink it... 
Washed again with water and then I saw that it was in fact the coating that was migrating to the water 

Made this movie and photos to share

If this coating is made with Teflon or other fluoro compounds... PFAS.. This is very dangerous 
Send some samples to a lab in order to know if it is, or not PFAS

1i0nc5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1i0nc5p/my_flights_went_just_fine_but_thats_not_the_point/,"My flights went just fine, but that’s not the point.","Hi all! I posted on here a few times a week or so ago about my anticipation anxiety for a work trip from San Francisco to New Orleans. 

For context, I always had a good amount of anticipatory anxiety as a kid, but was overall okay with flying. Around the time I turned 17 though, I developed a very intense anxiety/panic disorder. Suddenly the thought of being stuck in a tube high above the earth sounded like torture. I hadn’t flown since I was 13, and I didn’t fly again until the age of 28. I avoided so many wonderful opportunities and experiences because I couldn’t even fathom facing that fear. I’m 30 now, and in the last few years I’ve been taking significant steps to work on this. This is in thanks mostly to years of therapy, a good antidepressant, a specific prescription for flying, and a great job that sometimes asks me to travel. I have been mostly able to avoid a lot of this travel, (“scheduling conflicts”, letting other team members go, etc) but I also don’t want to. I want to take advantage of a career that PAYS ME to see new places and meet new people. I want to live my life. I’d gotten to the point that something needed to change. So over the last couple years I’ve done a few one hour flights with my boyfriend to practice. For each of those, I was a horrible nervous wreck, but for each of those actual flights, I was either just fine in spite of nerves or actually enjoyed it. This didn’t stop the anticipatory anxiety from coming back each time though. This is always the worst part.

I finally decided to bite the bullet and volunteered to go to this conference in New Orleans, even though I knew it would be a 4 hour flight, and my first trip completely by myself. In the month and a half leading up, I was an absolute basket case. I wasn’t sleeping, I was constantly scared, I felt like I was living in a nightmare. There were so many times I wanted to bail (which I have before with 2 other cross country trips). My biggest fear I think was bailing. Bailing and having to live with the fact that I wasn’t making progress and was moving backwards. But I was determined to keep putting one foot in front of the other and keep going, even if I was scared. Maybe this is corny, but something that I found that helped me was this Emily Dickinson quote, “If your Nerve deny you - Go above your Nerve.” I used this as a mantra.

I had insane panic attacks the two or three nights before the flight, but I woke up the morning of weirdly calm. At the gate, I asked if I could preboard to speak to the pilots and was allowed this. The pilots were kind and told me how long they’d been flying. I asked them if the flight would be smooth and they said no. This set off my alarm bells but I told myself my mantra and went to my seat. I made small talk with my neighbors, who were both very sweet. It turned out practically everyone on the plane was going to the same conference, and something about this made me feel like I was on a plane with 100 other friends. When the door closed, instead of feeling panic, I felt a rush of joy, because now, no matter what, I was going on my trip. 

The flight was bumpy. But I was fine. With each bump, all of my training kicked in. I knew I was safe, encased in jello, in a strong aircraft and with experienced pilots whose actual faces I could see in my mind. My palms were still sweaty most of the way, but I worked on my knitting and I listened to my favorite songs, and before I knew it I was there.

I HAD THE BEST TIME. I cannot even explain. I was there for work, but I had one mostly open day and was able to take advantage of my evenings because New Orleans has such a fantastic night scene. 

I ate the greatest meals I’ve ever had. I went to the insectarium, the aquarium, the pharmacy museum, the jazz museum, the voodoo museum, Jackson Square, the St. Louis Cathedral, a gorgeous yarn store, the bookstore that sits in the old home of William Faulkner, the bar that was the mayors home in the 1700s. I wandered and explored. I ate beignets that were orgasmic. I had the best cup of coffee in the world. I made new friends, I had great conversations. I made important career connections. I went to a jazz show that made me cry. I hugged a stranger. I got a tattoo on a whim. 

While I was sitting and crying at that jazz show,  I realized that my greatest fear had been stopping me from my greatest experiences. I realized that that plane ride I’d been building up in my head for so long was NOTHING. Even with the fear. The plane is nothing. Fuck the plane. Fuck the sweaty palms. Fuck the fear. Who cares. The plane is a vessel, a transitory blip. The point is where it takes you. The point is the brand new things and people it allows you to see, and the stronger person you will be because of those experiences.

Sitting on the tarmac on my first flight back, I felt the familiar feeling of panic again. I wanted to run off. I didn’t. I talked to my neighbor, another new person I never would have met otherwise. I did my knitting. I listened to my music. Seatbelt sign was on the whole flight, flight attendants seated too. I was fine. Next flight. Sweaty palms. Did my mantra. Thought about my boyfriend and my dog waiting at home. Did my mantra. Watched a funny show, a funny movie. Landed at home, safe and sound and elated. 

It’s possible I will always have these nerves. But I’m feeling more determined than ever to go above them. Please get on your plane. It will be so worth it. 

TLDR: do the thing even if you’re scared, and you’ll have something to show for it.",29,1736799128.0,fearofflying,5,1.0,False

I have a couple of questions for small coffee shop owners, or anyone interested in a consistent coffee subscription:

1. Are there any issues you face with currently available coffee options in the market?
2. Is there anything you wish could be improved throughout the entire process?

I'd love to hear your thoughts, even if they're only loosely related to coffee purchases.

Thanks in advance for your input!",1,1736799011.0,Coffee_Shop,13,0.6,False
