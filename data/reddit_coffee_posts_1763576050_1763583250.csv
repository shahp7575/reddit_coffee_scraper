Buckle up buckaroos, this is a long one. Feel free to skip around if you don't care what games I play.

ABOUT ME: I am a 23-year-old woman from Finland! A graduated hairdresser, fashion designer and have also studied history and archeology. I write books and poetry and have the loveliest, most cutiest patootiest borzoi ever. I am also a radical feminist! I am witty, kind, have a good sense of humor and I defend the people I love to death. I love chatting and helping people. I'm genuine and loyal, and when I'm there for you, I am there for you until the end. 

INTERESTS: I love art, movies, museums, music, tattoos, coffee, old architecture, travelling, clothes, shopping and all sorts of stuff, really. Sighthounds are my favorite dogs. I speak Finnish and English fluently and I'm studying French and refreshing my memory of Swedish.

MUSIC: Some interests of mine: punk/classic rock/alt rock/indie folk. Some of the long long list of bands and artists I adore; Hamilton Leithauser, The Smiths, Angus & Julia Stone, First Aid Kit, Sharon Van Etten, The Strokes, Skunk Anansie, Keaton Henson, Greg Laswell, The Walkmen, Big Thief, Iron & Wine, Surf Curse, Rilo Kiley, Twin Peaks, New Order, Bratmobile, Regina Spektor and Kings of Leon.

TV SHOWS: Love a ton but here are my absolute favorites; Penny Dreadful, Girlboss, Game of Thrones, HIMYM, Supernatural, Gilmore Girls, Grey's Anatomy, Sharp Objects, Fleabag, Heroes, ASOUE, Band of Brothers, New Girl, The Good Place, Stranger Things and The Office.

GAMES: Unavowed, Kathy Rain games, Skyrim, Fallout 4, Red Dead Redemption 2, Life is Strange -games, Stardew Valley and Castle Crashers.

BAD THINGS ABOUT ME (the horror!): I live in Finland. I have a chronic illness that drains my energy, so if I take a minute, it's probably not you but me. I am also really stubborn and have a hard time explaining my political stances because of memory and word loss, so I might get frustrated. I also kill every single plant I lay my eyes on.

THINGS I DISLIKE: lying, cheating, ghosting, blocking, deleting messages, dishonesty, assuming instead of asking, shockingly bad grammar, people writing et cetera as ""ect"", anime (not Ghibli), taking days to reply without a good reason, the color red, hypocrisy and not taking accountability for your own actions.

MISCELLANEOUS: I love smiling at strangers. I am afraid of puking and running in stairs. I must own, like, 50 pairs of jeans. I am an eternal romantic. I have 50+ hours on BG3 and have spent it all just making characters. 

I have a letterboxd I can share if you're a fellow movie buff and a discord account we can continue discussing on if we happen to hit it off. I can also share some of my playlists if your taste in music needs rescuing desperately.

I am ALWAYS looking for that specific person who might be my soulmate. People can be genuinely amazing and I'd be dumb if I didn't still believe that person is out there.

1p1icc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p1icc4/wrong_person_right_time/,Wrong Person Right Time,"Hi all,  
FYI, the title is not a typo :(

So yeah, let’s go back to the end of February this year. I (24M) matched with this girl (24F) on a dating app and things were pretty good. We hit it off really quickly. We used to flirt and chat for hours without getting bored. After a few days of constant texting, we decided to meet.

The date went really well — we talked a lot over coffee, and we even walked hand in hand. If you asked me to describe it in one word, I would say *perfect*. She liked it too, and we continued talking. We then had two more dates, which went well too.

But yes, here comes the twist. I was seriously ill at that time, so for my treatment I had to regularly visit the hospital for the next two months, and I couldn’t go out or do much. That basically meant that after just three dates, we suddenly entered a long-distance talking stage. She hadn’t dated anyone before, so I actually asked her to leave me and find someone else since my treatment was going to take time. But she decided to stay — and she really stayed and waited for me.

This made me fall for her, and finally after two months of the talking stage, we started dating. I met her twice after my treatment was done, but then again I had to leave town and we were hit with long distance again. Things were going pretty well, and after a month and a half, I went to meet her. We spent some good time together, but she admitted that she wasn’t as attracted to me anymore. She would zone out a lot. I honestly thought it was because of the distance, and I tried to convince her by telling her the same.

Anyway, after this, she had to leave town because of her job. So yeah, you guessed it — another round of long distance. But since I was getting better, I told her that no matter where she goes, I will come and visit her as often as possible. And keeping that promise, I planned my next visits and even booked a ticket for one of them.

One day, while I was telling her about my plans, the unexpected happened. Long story short, she wanted to break up with me because she didn’t feel attracted to me anymore. She had been thinking about it for a month but didn’t tell me. I was devastated. I tried a lot to make her stay, but she was adamant about breaking up. She said she still loved me, but didn’t want to continue. Also, we worked in completely unrelated fields and she wanted to date someone from her field.

Even though I tried hard, we eventually agreed to break up after one more month because I already had plans to visit her. Things were going normal until one day — about 10 days before I was supposed to meet her — I received the nightmare text: “WE NEED TO TALK.”

I already knew where this was going, and yes, the same thing happened. She didn’t want to meet me anymore because she liked someone else. To summarize, we had a big fight and we broke up.

I’m not saying I’m innocent. I’m also to blame. I had anger issues. I was a bit insecure — not much, but enough to cause problems. My insecurity came from feeling like I wasn’t good enough for her and that she could find anyone better. Most of our fights happened because of me. But when she left, she said that whatever she felt for me was just infatuation because she felt bad for my health. That hurt me a lot, but I still miss her so much.

It has been around 1.5 months since the breakup, but I miss her badly. Today I was missing her a lot, so I decided to share it here. Sorry for such a long post, and thanks to whoever managed to stay till the end :)",1,1763582972.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

if you’ve gone to one of these can you please tell me what it was like?

I'm assuming there is a relationship between enough light, humidity, and nutrients, along with how stiff pitchers typically are (I'm assuming a lowii or ephippiata pitcher takes more energy and resources to make, since they are significantly stiffer than glandulifera or ramispina). I most frequently see the first type of growth a few months after foliar feeding with diluted coffee, but not every plant takes this growth habit after fertilization.

But never have courage to talk to a girl because I have zero female interaction since school time. So few months ago, I saw a girl in a college function. First I thought it's just my desparation. She comes out to be a common acquaintance. Our common friend introduced us to eachother. She is a good badminton player and goes to college gymnasium every day. So I also started going to gymnasium. Where we had some formal interactions that's all. Then our semester exam started and then summer vacations. My close friend is also a good friend to her and so we used to meet every few days. And somehow got our numbers exchanged. One day I gathered some courage and texted her and asked for coffee. After some hesitations she said yes. That day we don't went for coffee but went to our colleges hanging point which is like a couples point in ourCollege. Then a night I texted her, then started the conversation. We chatted about a month and went out a few times. Then, suddenly out of nowhere I just confessed my feelings to her. I know it was too early. She don't get angry but respectfully said no. I was hard for me, but being a total jackass I convence her to atleast give it a try. Meanwhile a number of my friends and classmates and seniors came to know about it as she is really known in college due to her badminton skills and also involved in clubs and good academics. A few of my friends started teasing me because of it. And somehow I grew some deeper feelings for her. how I About two months later I asked her, are we really something and wasting our time. A very chutiya and gandmara decision. She said ' I think we should stop  this here only '. I was devastated but then  accepted that. We meets a regularly but never interacted after that. Meanwhile some college gossip page posted a story telling we are dating even after a month of our last conversation. Which really fucked up things for us, because everyone in the campus asks us about that.Today she texted me that someone made a fake id of me and texted her,which is really frustrating. We don't talk anymore, but I am have longing that someday she will accept. Which is kinda nonsense. I still believes she's the right one for me and we are meant to be together.

*Humans are trained in war. It’s almost as if their planet hated them. Unlike most other planets, the continental plates there broke apart entirely, creating small continents—perfect for empires with natural borders, ideal for a ten-thousand-year history of war.*

*Do you think you discovered a new strategy? Think again, because some human in a loincloth had already used it long ago and learned how to counter it.*

*Good luck with your moronic ideas of conquering the Aligned Worlds. The Krinakt will not join such an endeavor again.*

**Senator Urk’net Wasum, speaking before the Galactic Federation Senate on the eve of the Third War against the Aligned Worlds, 420 P.I.**

 

Rish sat in the office, monitoring the station and the ships docked at the dockyard. Especially the *Magellan* caught her eye. The hull plating was still missing from the outer hull, and you could partly see through the decks.

Two Nuk corvettes were still positioned around her to guard her against any possible attacks. The Nuk revered the *Magellan* and her crew as if they were mythic gods of war out of their legends.

In the bay next to the *Magellan*, an even more guarded ship sat. It was the front part of a Batract battlecruiser. This debris was the first debris ever captured from a destroyed Batract ship. The Shraphen and human engineers were almost fighting over who would examine the debris first.

Initial data revealed why human digital boarding measures had been ineffective. The entire ship’s control systems were biological, with massive neural networks connecting the various stations.

Rish sipped her cup of coffee slowly. She had learned to enjoy the drink. Her ears lay flat on her head; she hadn’t decided yet if she liked having a Batract cruiser docked at her station or not.

It was a moot point anyway. She was appointed as the station's security head, so she had to take any necessary action to ensure safety. She had positioned a hundred suicide drones around it and ordered the construction of multiple security checkpoints at the entrance of the ship’s gangway.

To quote Captain Gerber: better safe than sorry.

The station—no, *her* station—was a massive thing. It had a vertical central spine three kilometers tall, crowned at the top with three rings that housed the docks. Eighty ships could dock simultaneously. Then there were the four dockyards for repair and refit atop the ring docks.

More than sixty thousand people lived and worked at the station.

The humans constructed it after they fortified the system. Currently, it is known as Taishan Tar One. In the alliance agreement, it was established that a human admiral would command the station, with the first officer a Shraphen and the rest of the crew mixed. So the governor had appointed her as head of security.

Her security pack was almost a thousand strong, and it was also mixed with humans and shraphen.

Now the Nuk deserters were asking to join the fragile alliance.

Her tail swung powerlessly; she had no clue what to think of the Nuk.

On the one hand, there was never any love lost between the Nuk and the Shraphen, partly because they rarely met; Nuk didn’t leave their home system except when the Batract sent them to crush a rebellion.

But the more she thought about it, the more Rish concluded that the Batract had intentionally manipulated the different vassal species to be antagonistic to each other—a sure way to prevent a more planned rebellion, like the one the humans had just pulled off.

Taishan Tar One was visited more and more by supply ships from Earth, bringing in supplies and personnel. The fortification of the system proceeded according to plan.

The next step was a refit of more than five hundred Shraphen military ships, and possibly the refit of the Nuk fleet as well. All would be equipped with the human Davies Guns.

She emptied her coffee and prepared some reports. Later today, she and Lieutenant Koval, her second-in-command now, would join an engineering team to survey an ice moon on the third gas giant of the system. The engineers were scouting for a possible planet-based defense position, and the moon was an ideal candidate.

Usually, she would not join away missions, but after three months on the station, even with the massive parks humans love to build in their installations, she had to do something physically.

After this mission, her next job was securing the alliance meeting on the station. Humans, Shraphen, Nuk, and Gliders would meet and formalize further actions. For her, it sounded like the most boring thing imaginable. She was a hunter, a scout, not a security guard. But if the governor of the colony asked you to do something, you didn’t say no.

The flight deck of the station was large, but she knew where the *Sleipnir* was parked, waiting to bring them to the moon.

After the launch, the three engineers aboard, two humans and one shraphen, were already discussing the probable upgrades to the station. One mentioned the Nuk considering giving the alliance the plans for the Nuk shield generators. Combined with the massive output the human fusion cores could generate, Rish was sure the station could withstand a Batract armada alone.

The flight to the unnamed moon would take three hours, so she decided to sleep that time.

 

—————

 

Awaking from a dreamless sleep, she checked her suit’s clock. They were almost at the moon. She did not know what the human armorer back on *Argos* had done to her suit, but ever since he repaired it, it had been much more comfortable to sleep in. She assumed it was because of the new kinetic gel padding.

Chief Watanabe was already preparing the surveying gear with the other engineers. Rish thought the engineer’s eyes looked adorable, but of course, she did not share the thought — not with humans, at least.

She kicked the boot of Lieutenant Koval, who snored so loudly it was audible even through the closed visor of his helmet.

He made one last loud snore, then his hand made the instinctive grip to check his rifle — a trait all human soldiers had. “Was just checking the mission parameters.”

“Yeah, right. Let me guess, you trained the anti-grizzly growl to scare off dangerous bears if we meet some,” Tech First Grade Jenna Gagnon joked.

“You laugh, wait until we meet a Wampa, then you’ll be happy to have us there,” Koval answered, still sounding sleepy.

Rish checked her new ocular for information on *Wampa*; she had learned many humans made cultural references to fictional works. She groaned — another thirty movies she had to watch. How could one little planet have so many movies and TV shows?

“Ha, I’ll be happy to have you here if you carry that stuff out,” Gagnon said, smiling at Koval.

“Just take a room, you two,” Chief Watanabe called from behind a stack of pipes.

Rish snickered, especially when she noticed the Shraphen tech standing there watching the scene, his ears angled straight to the side — a clear sign of his confusion.

She walked over to him.

He whispered quietly, “Pack Leader Rish, are humans always so… disorganized and… chaotic?”

Checking her ocular, she saw his name appear on an overlay — Chief Nurkro. “They are not chaotic, Chief. They are bantering, their way of relieving stress. Is this your first mission with humans?”

“Yes. I arrived at the station yesterday. My Pack Leader… ahm, my Chief… thought it would help me get used to my colleagues.”

Rish studied the Shraphen Chief. At the station, it was now usual to use human ranks. For him to be a chief in the engineering department, he must be a skilled technician — and, as such, probably helplessly unskilled in social skills.

“He is right. Trust me, they are just like tai, only more intelligent.” Rish clapped the tech on the shoulder, another human trait.

“And more murderous and armed,” murmured.

Rish knew where that came from. Everyone on the colony knew about the heroic victories the humans had pulled off — twice now — against the Batract. But that created a mental picture of humans as savage, murderous warriors.

Not that this wasn’t part of the truth. She knew very well that humans could be that way, but it missed their deeply caring traits. For Rish, those were humanity’s best traits.

“Chief Nurkro, trust me, you’ll love them.”

“If you say so, Pack Leader—oh, sorry, Lieutenant Commander, right?”

“Right…” She didn’t like her rank. It was long and stuck in the muzzle.

She and Watanabe went up to the pilot to look for a good landing spot. Initial surveys with probes had revealed a crater. Since the moon had a carbon atmosphere, wind was an issue, so the crater walls would protect them from the worst weather.

From the cockpit, she could see the white ground below her move. Splashes of red and gray gave the surface some contours. According to the mission briefing, those were mineral deposits such as iron oxide and salt — indications of an ocean beneath the ice.

Watanabe explained that an ocean would disqualify the moon as a defense position but would qualify it as a deuterium extraction site. Rish didn’t care about deuterium; she just wanted her planet safe.

They found an ice formation near the crater’s center that would perfectly block the continuous storms. As the *Sleipnir* landed, they put on their parkas over their suits. Even though they were space- and vacuum-rated, the surface temperatures on the moon were around –70°C, close to the freezing point of CO₂.

Rish initially did not understand why they had to wear boots and parkas, but after the techs explained that the atmosphere and the ice would suck the heat out of her suit, she thought she understood.

Situations like these made her wish she had paid more attention to science in her education. On the other hand, none of the techs here were better hunters or scouts than she was. Everyone had their place in the pack, just as Shraphen wisdom dictated.

As soon as she stepped out of the Airlock and the suit threw environmental warnings, she was happy about the heated parks. Without them, she would be dead in a few hours.

The techs decided to take some measurements with seismic charges first. She and Koval had nothing to do — the techs had to place the charges and sensors at exact distances — so the two soldiers stood close to the ice formation and watched them.

“Still sure it was a good idea to go on this mission, Lieutenant Commander?” She could almost see the human grin through his helmet’s faceplate.

Looking up at the crater, the white ice drenched in the yellow-brown light of the gas giant on the horizon, and the remnants of the enormous ring that, millennia ago, had formed the moon they now stood on, Rish knew her answer. “Oh yes, Lieutenant, it was a perfect idea.”

Koval followed her gaze. Ten long seconds, both just stared, then he turned to her, “Yeah, me too.”

Both turned their attention back to the engineers, who were almost finished setting up the charges.

Something nagged at Rish; she knew this place from somewhere. Or something similar. Every sense in her told her they were in danger.

She checked the whole procedure and the science behind it on her ocular implant and made a decision.

“Chief, I want everyone in the *Sleipnir* when you blow the charges. I won’t risk the ice breaking and harming someone.”

“But Commander, that’s unnecessary. The ice sheet is at least ten miles thick.” Watanabe was not at all happy about it.

“That’s ten miles someone could fall. Listen, you have your jobs, I have mine. Your security is my priority. The sensors are wireless — I checked.”

The Chief, who didn’t want to waste time stepping into and out of the airlock, gave in. Rish was the highest ranking, and the admiral was sure to rip him a new one if he started a fight with the Shraphen security leader.

The team collected their gear and stepped back into the *Sleipnir*.

Tech Gagnon didn’t hide her disappointment at Rish’s decision, but kept quiet.

Rish went to the door of the cockpit. “Lieutenant Rodgers, please bring us twenty meters above the ground — just to be sure.”

Watanabe had taken off his helmet and rolled his eyes, but wisely chose silence as well.

Rish was now sure that something would happen, but she still couldn’t point to why. Maybe a story from her childhood. But she was born on Taishon Tar, and she was sure no one had ever visited this moon.

“Aye, sir,” was the only answer from the pilot. Then the *Sleipnir’s* engine started, and soon they hovered above the crater.

“May we, Commander?” the chief asked, still angry about the delays.

Rish nodded. The other two techs concentrated on their tablets while Koval joined the pilot in the cockpit. He himself was a trained pilot, so he could assist if something happened.

Watanabe pressed the trigger. Rish saw four small ice clouds appear in the crater. Then nothing — no rifts, nothing.

“A bit anticlimactic, don’t you think?” the chief said, standing next to her.

“Better that than—”

Both stared out of the window as a massive ice boulder missed the *Sleipnir* by just a few meters.

The transporter accelerated instantly upward, alarms ringing from the cockpit.

Rish’s ears lay flat on her head, and she had to force her tail to obey and not move between her legs.

Gagnon and Nurkro both screamed in shock at the sudden acceleration; both had been intensely focused on the seismic data.

Outside the transporter, a massive geyser formed, blasting water five kilometers into space.

“How did you know?” Chief Watanabe stared at Rish as if she were a ghost.

“If only I knew. I just had a very bad feeling suddenly.” She really could not explain it.

“I’ll never, ever doubt your feelings.”

“Chief, Chief, come look at that!” Nurkro was still checking the seismic data, ignoring the maelstrom of ice and water outside.

“Yes, Nurkro, what is it? We know it’s an ocean beneath the ice.”

“No, you won’t believe it, trust me!” The Shraphen tech was obviously excited, his tail wagging as if he were a pup.

Rish couldn’t make anything out on the screen, but Watanabe dropped the nicotine vaporizer he had just sucked on and stared at the display with an open mouth.

“What is it, Chief?” Gagnon asked, finally checking the screen again after staring at the geyser the *Sleipnir* had accelerated away from.

“The whole moon is water — all of it — except for a small core at the center. Thirteen hundred kilometers beneath us,” Nurkro answered.

“What’s so special about that?” Now Rish was interested.

“The core looks awfully like a big-ass ship.” The chief’s face had gone white from shock.

I could see her nipples out of her bra showing through her blouse. I said something and she said she didn't tuck them properly. There was a massive fight that night.

1p1i1l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fsxontap/comments/1p1i1l6/snapshots_chill_the_lazy_admins_guide_to_data/,Snapshots & Chill: The Lazy Admin’s Guide to Data Protection with FSx for ONTAP,"Let’s face it: managing data protection and backups can be tedious. But what if it took less time than making coffee? 
Enter Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP Snapshots, a built-in, point-in-time copy mechanism that secures your data instantly. Forget complex scripts and slow backups; Snapshots allow admins to relax while knowing their data is safe, consistent, and recoverable in seconds.

Snapshots that Just Work

Traditional backup systems can take hours to copy data, increasing recovery point objectives (RPOs) and operational costs. Snapshots in ONTAP, however, are copy-on-write and incremental. They only record changed blocks since the last Snapshot, which means they take up minimal space and complete in moments.

When integrated natively within FSx for ONTAP, Snapshot copies enable
:

✅ Instant recovery of deleted or corrupted files.

✅ Application-consistent backups for databases and virtual machines.

✅ Cross-region replication when paired with SnapMirror for DR strategy across AWS regions.

Here’s an example: suppose an organization running its ERP system on EC2 and FSx for ONTAP suffers data corruption. Instead of restoring a multi-terabyte backup, the admin rolls back to the Snapshot from 15 minutes ago - no downtime marathon, no panic.

Business Impact

Snapshots give organizations:

✅ Reduced downtime costs due to near-instant recovery.

✅ Better data durability without additional storage overhead.

✅ Improved compliance for RPO/RTO benchmarks, especially in regulated industries.

Combining Snapshots with AWS Backup further strengthens disaster recovery posture, giving enterprises a low-maintenance but high-resilience data protection framework.

Summary

Snapshots & Chill is more than a catchy motto—it’s the new reality for AWS data management. With FSx for ONTAP, data protection becomes automated, fast, and nearly invisible to end users. Admins get their weekends back, and businesses enjoy uninterrupted continuity.",1,1763582310.0,fsxontap,2,1.0,False

I started dipping my toes a bit deeper into the world of coffee and really like espresso. I have access to an Breville Barista Express BES860XL the grinder on it is pretty meh for medium and dark roasts even for my filter use which tends to be pour over and cold brews.

I wanna change out my grinder first since it seems like the easiest thing to change first in this setup. A hand grinder doesn't seem inconvenient for my use case or my workflow. So I want to go do down this route, however there are so many decent choice at the $300 - $400 USD range. My choice seems to be right now gravitating towards the Lido OG, because it has very granular control about 5 microns on it micro adjustment which seem very good for espresso and then it can be easily adjusted for filter use as well. Another strong contendor seems to be the K-Ultra, though I have heard different opinions about the cup it produces for certain espressos and even filters. I am also not completely against the idea of getting two different hand grinders for their intended use cases such as a J-Ultra for espresso and a ZP6 for filter, but I would like to have ease of access to so my workflow is a bit uninterrupted in the morning hence why having one grinder is a bit more use case friendly.

Other than those grinders I have named for hand grinding are there others within that price range and really not exceeding $400 that can suit my needs for now. I don't want to get into the electric grinder scene due to not having adequate counter space for any of them atm.",1,1763582207.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

•Loved the Masquerade element 
•Loved the masks 🎭 they were so pretty & matched our outfits 
•Was happy I had the option to say I didn’t think my li would be loyal (not be pining over him) 
•My girls had my back when I said I didn’t think he’d be loyal. Each one of them offered their support!! Love it! Ty! I have more than one designated bestie. I’m having friends- a real island experience! 
•The casa boys matched each of the girls outfits too in some way it was super cute 
•The casa boys are fione! They’re not all the dreams boys, like I thought they’d be, but I was right about the ogli2 being dumped & coming back to be our hater. 
•Idc that he’s our hater. I’d rather it be a salty man than a desperate woman who hates me for no reason. At least he thinks he has a reason & I’ve met men like that in real life who think all women owe them something. His behavior totally tracks when he mentioned dates he doesn’t have to pay for, being overly flirty & all the girls not wanting him, yeah definitely met plenty of men throughout my life with that kinda attitude. They hate us bc we don’t want them. So that was believable. 
•I liked the name switch up! I thought it was cute and on brand for the masquerade. Not a biggie. Thought it was cute that my mc only recognized her dream boy/childhood friend, bc YES you are forgettable Eren/Nere 🤣
•Cute bonding with Annabel specifically, and I loved it! It was a little flirty & I enjoy my friendship with her!!
•My MCs turn on is roleplay, so she was loving the masquerade, and she was loving the flirty banter with Sammy. This is the second time he’s done a little role play with her too 😉 
•I enjoyed seeing other parts of my MCs world 🌎 I thought it was super cute 🥰 and it gave her more of an identity outside of Love Island 🏝️ & romantic relationships!!! So yeah I really absolutely love seeing her in her the coffee shop, eating her fav snack, working on her project for her career- she’s not just a  pretty face, she’s a hard worker too. She has a past, exes & ohs. I got to see her cute apartment! I loved it! She’s an artist, and she had books. Sammy is a writer & she’s an artist & was working on art for a children’s book. It was so cute that they match like that. 
•It was realistic that Sammy was being torn between mc & other people. Mc was also feeling the same. Fate kept bringing them together but life kept pulling them apart. That was something an adult would go through. It was realistic to me. If you’ve ever had friendships like that. That teeter on the “what if”, it was totally reasonable to believe this would happen. It’s giving “forbidden love.” 
•We’re both career driven & he appreciates that about mc. Shes supportive & understanding about his too. Love that!! Very grown folk energy.
•Sammy took up for mc & it reminded me of Matt. Love a man that stands on business. He refused to kiss anyone else. Whew, that loyalty, love it!!!
•My girls don’t play about mc!! Joya stood up for me & Annabel offered support. Clocked that jealousy coming from dumpy boy. 
•When I noticed some energy between Joya & Sammy, I was so upset at first. Then I thought about it. Joya & mc are the hottest girls in the game. Joya has gotten the short end of the stick so far with her choices. It makes sense that we liked each other & have the same type. We both want the hottest guys. Can I really blame her? So what if they have a harmless flirt? Should she not have any fun when we’re not together & her only other choices are always horrible?! No. That would be unfair & unreasonable to think she can’t like the same guys that I do. She’s my girl, I trust her & I trust Sammy. Neither of them have given me reason not to. I’m not going to be a hater. I want a man/woman to chose me because they want me, not because they feel guilted into it. I don’t think she Sammy did anything; Eren definitely set that up. 
•I loved that we went to the beach instead of the pool!!! They switched it up & I love seeing all these new backgrounds for us!! 
•My new swimsuit & lingerie & fit options were hot af!! Ty for giving us new ones fb!! I was complaining about the other ones, I was so happy to see these ones. Maybe they’ll give us some hot shoes next chapter bc we need it fs. 

••• I don’t appreciate having to pay for memories! I get they need their money at the same time just side 👀 a little bit, bc they overplayed their hand with it. Once, okay twice, alright 4 times- well damn. Do I reallllyyy need to remember??! 🙈😩🙂‍↔️	
•••Ollie was 90s fine and it sucked that I couldn’t even speak to anyone but the man child & my dream boy. Yes, I want to be with Sammy and I was kicking my feet with joy n giggling 🤭 when I saw him, but I’d still like to have a real casa experience. Not having choices ruins that.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phoenix Suns vs. Portland Trail Blazers: A High-Stakes Hoops Honeymoon**

The Portland Trail Blazers, fresh off a two-game losing streak, host the Chicago Bulls in a matchup that’s as much a numbers game as it is a test of pride. Let’s break it down with the precision of a stat geek and the humor of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The Blazers enter as home favorites, with most books pricing them at **+200 to +220** (implied probability: \~31-33%) and the Bulls at **-300 to -350** (implied probability: \~67-71%). That’s not just a spread—it’s a *statement*. The total is set at **244.5 points**, a number so high it makes a Las Vegas buffet look restrained. Both teams rank in the NBA’s top half for offensive output, but Portland’s defense is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine. The Bulls, meanwhile, have a new weapon: **Coby White**, who just torched the Jazz for 27 points in his season debut. His return is like giving a toaster a PhD—it suddenly feels *dangerous*.

### Team News: Injuries, Comebacks, and the Eternal Struggle of Rebounding

The Blazers’ woes? A recent 1-4 road trip and a defense that allows opponents to grab **15.2 offensive rebounds per game** (23rd in the league). They’re also 24th in fewest second-chance points allowed, which is NBA code for “we’ll let you tie our shoelaces and score over us.” Their saving grace? Home-court advantage and a roster that includes **Damian Lillard**, who can drop 40 points on you before you finish your pregame smoothie.

The Bulls? They’ve got White back, and he’s hungry. After debuting with 27 points in a double-overtime win, he’s the team’s new emotional spark plug—assuming you ignore the fact that his jersey still says “Jazz” on the back (a

1p1hrkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1p1hrkx/struggling_in_grad_school/,Struggling in Grad School,"SOS.

Ladies I need help, or at least support! I’m in my second year of a three year grad school program. I’m thrilled to be here. I worked for years in landscaping and gardening and now I’m in a program for landscape architecture. Never in amillion years did I think I would subject myself to more school but I love what I do and I’m so proud to be where I am now.

My issue is that I am totally failing at juggling assignments, getting all my work done, staying on top of deadlines… all the stuff. I’m constantly surprised by what the assignment is and am struggling with creating and staying with workflows to actually complete assignments. I’m relying  on adrenaline to get assignments done. 

I have no official accommodations and until recently I was terrified to disclose to anyone bc of bad experiences in undergrad. But I was struggling so much I felt I had no choice and spoke to the department head. She is so wonderful and revealed to me that she also has adhd (I’m sure everyone can relate to the relief I felt when she told me that) and understands. The only accommodation I requested is that after new assignments are given out that I can have an extra 15 minutes with prof after class to make sure I actually understand what the assignment brief says. This has been a tremendous help.

I’m still really struggling though. Today I missed a class from over sleeping for the first time since starting the program. I have spent the entire day in a haze. I’ve been staring at a drawing that has to get done for an hour (more than an hour but I’m embarrassed to say) but I can’t get myself to do it. I’m behind on every class. I have an essay to write that was due a month ago. Not even mentioning my bills and outside obligations…
I try not to compare myself to others but it’s hard sometimes. My cohort is entirely women and these ladies are so amazing. They also clearly work really hard but all this computer stuff seems to come so much easier to them. They are always so aware and clued into what’s going on. I feel like such an outsider and quite frankly I feel a little dumb. 

I take stimulant meds, I drink a shit ton of coffee… I could be more consistent with exercise, I used to have a pretty regular routine, but it’s hard to find the time right now. I do walk a few miles a day though since I live in a walkable city. 

All my self imposed organizational systems that I have maintained for years to manage my adhd are breaking down. I have finals in a few weeks and then another three semesters to get this degree. 

I desire to do well but I keep falling short and it’s really hard to not feel shame and to constantly chastise myself. Does anyone have any advice of strategies that helped them get through school? Or just some life advice to an almost 30 spacecadet? I’m not expecting a magic solution, I know I’m always going to have adhd, but I need to change something because what I’m doing right now ain’t working.

Thank you for reading my long post.

We are currently feeding out 2 month old baby 32Oz RTF, and we want to transition to powder since the risk of cronobacter is lower and also reduce cost. 

We are about to increase her feed to 140mL per bottle

Our powder direction is every 2 Oz of water add 1 scooper of powder, and per scoop adds \~0.2Oz to the mixed formula. 

For our situation, we will be making 1 pitcher of 840mL=28.4 Oz (6 bottles) mixing 25.8 Oz + 12.9 scoops assuming per scoop dissolved adds 10% into the final formula, or do 26 oz + 13 scoops to save our sanity. 

but if we were to up her bottle to 160mL, the numbers start to act up: 

960mL (32.46 Oz) = 29.51Oz + 14.75 scoops, 

What would be a good way to measure the partial scoops, does a 0.1g coffee scale work in this case? 

Or should we make the pitcher with the same mount (with a little extra) and mix with the next batch? But always with a bottle mixed with new and old, and the formula indicates not to keep mixed formula in the fridge for more than 24 hrs. ",1,1763581585.0,FormulaFeeders,5,1.0,False

I don’t know if I’m (28m) being controlled, overthinking, or just worn down. Need outside perspectives.","So for context: my girlfriend and I are long distance. The start of the relationship was honestly amazing. We clicked instantly, have loads in common, and when we’re together in person it’s the most relaxed, natural thing ever. We bounce off each other effortlessly.



But… she has a rough history. Her last relationship really messed her up. She won’t talk about it much, but she told me it left her with some mental health issues and major trust problems with men (including me). She also struggles with emotional regulation, which doesn’t help.



Meanwhile, I’m a pretty grounded guy who tends to look at the bright side of life. But this year has been brutal for me personally — my dad got cancer and had surgery, and I lost my cousin to suicide. Somehow I’ve stayed positive thanks to my friends and, of course, my girlfriend.



The last few weeks though? Honestly, painful. She just started a new uni course and has a lot on her plate. When she gets overwhelmed, she shuts down — goes quiet for days, says she needs space. It hurts, but I know people handle stress differently. And I can ALWAYS tell when something’s wrong with her. It’s not like reading a book — it’s like reading a Kindle with a cheat code.



But this week was different. After an entire weekend of not speaking, she was REALLY off. And I basically end up tied to her emotions — if she’s not okay, I can’t be okay. I’ve been losing sleep over it, waking up at 4am unable to get back to sleep. She knows all this, but she never really reaches out to help when I’m struggling.



Then today she messaged me saying she couldn’t deal with the stress of the relationship anymore. I told her I already knew, and she was surprised… but I always know when something’s bothering her. I figured she’d bottled it up because of trauma from her ex, so I asked if we could talk about it calmly on a call. No arguments, no pressure, just talking. She agreed.



We talked for an hour. Here’s the condensed version:



* She said talking to me so much was stressing her out. I pointed out she usually calls, and I mostly stick to texting to avoid overwhelming her.
* She said because we’re long distance, our weekends always end up booked with each other. Fair point.
* She said thinking about moving in together was stressing her — even though she was the one pushing for it recently, and we had no actual plans yet.
* And she said she struggles to trust me because I’m a man. I reminded her I’m not her ex, and that every time we’ve met I’ve only ever tried to make her feel safe and relaxed — cooking for her, taking her out for nice dinners, doing her favourite activities, giving her massages, bringing her chocolates and coffee in bed so she’s cosy. She agreed completely. So basically, I’m a symptom of her stress, not the cause.





But she kept repeating that the relationship stress was too much. So I told her straight:

We either break up, and she can go back to how things were before. I don’t want that, but I’d do anything to make her happy — even that.

OR we work on this together.



I told her I wouldn’t break up with her because I didn’t want to repeat what her ex did to her. It had to be her choice. If she wanted to end it, she needed to call and tell me.



After the call I actually felt lighter — just knowing where we stand helped.



Later she called again, apologised for being snappy, and said we didn’t talk enough about the option of working things out. Long story short, we’re doing things her way for now.



But here’s where my mind won’t shut up:

Now that she got overwhelmed and pulled away, is she trying to regain control by setting all the terms?

Do I really have no say in anything?

Am I overthinking?

Or am I ignoring red flags because I care too much?



Because I don’t want to go back to constantly worrying about her mood, or walking on eggshells.



What do you guys think? Is this normal stress, trauma, and long-distance stuff… or is this sliding into unhealthy dynamics?

TL;DR: Long-distance relationship started great, strong connection, lots in common. She has trauma from her ex and big trust/emotional regulation issues. Lately she’s been overwhelmed with uni and life, shutting down for days and pulling away. I’ve been losing sleep and getting tied to her moods. She said the relationship is stressing her out, but after talking she wants to “do things her way” now. I’m worried I have no say and she’s trying to regain control. Not sure if this is normal stress/trauma stuff or unhealthy dynamics. Looking for advice.

Misty left her door cracked that morning after she woke up and left for the day, and Neil and Mom were busy talking in the kitchen. Misty very rarely left her door open while she was gone; she had told me that she didn’t like me going through her things while she was away. I love my big sister, but it pisses me off that she feels the need to go through my things and then turn around and tell me that I’m not allowed to do the same. She was my much bigger sister, so there wasn’t much that I could do about it. 

With my parents occupied, I knew I had just enough time to find that damn hat she had been putting on me everyday for the last month. There had been many hats over the years, so many that I can’t even remember them all, but this one had long ears and a pointy hat with a bell on top of it, and for some reason, the twisted mind of the dingleberry who made it, also attached a white beard that hung down from my face. Misty loved it. 

I did not.

It was easy enough to find, it was right there out in the open, but getting up on the top of her dresser to get to it was another story. I weighed the pros and cons in my brain. Would it be better to just live with the humiliation of her constantly making me wear the damn thing and not have to put all that energy into getting up there, or would it be more satisfying to make my point clear to my sister that I was not to be trifled with?

It took me three attempts to get to the top of the dresser by jumping off of her bed, but once I was there, it was all worth it. There it was, that awful thing. I knew she’d just go find another one and replace it, but I didn’t care. I gave it a couple of punches before I gripped it with my teeth. Never doubt a motivated Meekus.

In my younger, much slimmer days, I would have just leapt back down to the floor without a second thought, but lately I had tried to work a little smarter, and the soreness in my leg still hadn’t gone away. It took hardly any effort to jump back down onto the bed from the dresser, so I jumped through the air with my prize between my teeth and landed back on the soft bed. I considered taking a quick nap after all that work, but I worried my parents might stop their conversation before I woke up.

I jumped easily to the floor from the bed. I knew exactly what I was going to do with the thing, I had even dreamed about it for over a week. I sleep a lot, so I dream a lot. I have a very good memory when it comes to my dreams, and that’s both a good and bad thing.

Mom and Neil were talking low as I made my way to the door of the kitchen; unfortunately the only way to get to my box in the laundry room was to walk straight through the kitchen. If either one of them saw me with that stupid hat, they would take it away from me without a second thought, making all the energy I had put into this adventure useless, and I would be just a little hungrier later that night for no reason. I stood just outside the door, listening to the conversation, waiting for the right time to streak across the floor and through the open door of the laundry room.

“I already talked to Mike. He’s going to take care of Meekus.” Neil was trying to be quiet. His voice was low.

Take care of me? Mike?

“Okay. Have you called him back yet?”

“Who?”

“Your Dad.”

“No. Not yet. I’m going to.”

“I just think it’s going to be a little awkward if we just show up without…”

“I’ll call him. Honestly, why are we even going?”

“Because it's your mother’s funeral Neil.”

“I know.”

“Did you feed Meekus this morning?”

“Yeah.”

“I don’t think you gave him enough. It’s already gone.” I loved her so much. I opened my mouth and let that damn hat lay on the ground in front of me. This was a conversation that I didn’t want to miss; taking care of Misty’s hat could wait for a moment. 

They were quiet for another few seconds and then I heard Neil pour himself another cup of coffee. Neil used to drink that stuff throughout the whole day, but for the last few years, he had only had a little right after he fed me. The fact that he was still drinking more of it that late in the day told me that he was either sick or he was worried about something, and even though my mind had been on my stomach, I was sure that he hadn’t smelled of sickness. Then I heard the sound that I had been waiting to hear all morning, the sound of my Mommy’s tiny feet leaving the creaky kitchen floor and slapping their way across the hard floor of the laundry room, and then the loud snap of the top of my food bin. 

I risked a glance around the corner of the doorway and was greeted by the sight of Mommy carrying a hefty scoop of crunchies over to my empty bowl. I pulled myself back around the corner, out of view, but my foot hit the bell on the damn hat and it made a small noise.

“What was that?”

“It’s probably Meekus playing around in there. He’s been acting like a jackass all morning.” 

Thanks Neil. Asshole.

I knew if I could just get rid of that hat, I could feel as though I had done something good with my day. I dipped my head down and scooped that thing back between my teeth and readied myself for the quick run past my parents. As soon as Mommy put the food scoop away in the laundry room and then had come back into the kitchen, I hunkered down and flexed my back legs, ready for one quick burst of speed. All the energy that it was going to take wasn’t even a worry anymore, because I knew that I had plenty of food waiting for me when it was all over.

“You need to call your Dad.”

“I said I would.”

“If you don’t call him now, I will.”

One.

“Mary, I don’t want to argue.”

Two.

“Then don’t. Call him.”

Three! I rounded the corner and stayed low to the ground as I sped through the kitchen, but no sooner had I begun to run, that I realized that the damn bell on the end of the damn hat was ringing. The sound made me move faster. From the corner of my eye, I could see that Neil had his back to me, and Mommy was busy staring at him. It would have been the perfect time, but they were starting to turn toward the sound of the bell. There were two steps down from the kitchen into the laundry room, and once I hit that first step, I knew that I had made it without being seen, but there was no way that I was going to be able to get to my box before Mommy would see me. I had to figure out where to hide it. The damn hat was mine, and even the sound of the bell wasn’t going to stop me. 

When I had cleared the second step and landed in the laundry room, I was still running at top speed, and then I felt it under my foot, that stupid beard that hung from the bottom of the hat. The laundry room floor was always slippery, and as that beard found its way under my foot, I knew I was in trouble. I hit the floor hard and I spit that hat out of my mouth along with all the air I had in my body. The world spun, and my ass crashed into the side of my food bin. 

The hat! I had lost the hat!

Even with the screaming pain in my leg, I was still worried about that ugly thing. I had looked around me, but it was nowhere to be found.  Mommy came into the laundry room, and I was trying to get up, but my leg wasn’t working. Mommy put her arms underneath me and I could smell her as she pulled me to her chest, and the thought of my mission to rid the world of the bearded hat was gone, and all there was in the world was Mommy.

I love my Mommy.

Things in life that make me happy: Food, scratches, pooping, eggnog, and Morning Mommy smell. That sweet smell that is warm with barely a hint of sweat and slobber. I rubbed my head against her chest where the smell was the greatest and I began to purr.

“That was weird.”

“He’s probably acting weird because he’s starving.” She understood me better than anyone.

“He’s nineteen pounds Mary, I think he’s doing alright.” Again, my Mommy was a self declared Optimystic. I had sat on the scale in their bathroom just a few days before. I wasn’t even paying attention to where I was, I just wanted to sit down in the same room with Mommy. Apparently, this scale showed her that I was nineteen pounds, which didn’t mean anything to me, but it meant a great deal to Mommy. She had squealed and scratched my head and went and told Neil that I had lost something called a pound. I had heard Neil say quite a few times that he was Agnostic, and maybe if he had been an Optimystic like my mother, he would have been excited that the one pound thingy had gone away. 

Instead, he started saying that the pound thing didn’t matter because I had nineteen more of them in me somewhere. Misty must have been an Optimystic too, because she was very happy. Even Magda, the woman who was kept inside of a building called the Vetoffice was happy that the pound had left, but not Neil. I make fun of Mommy’s religion all the time, but in all honesty, at least it isn’t as negative as Neil’s. 

“Can you please call your father, for me?” 

For me. 

Those were the powerful words of Optimysm that allowed Mommy to make people do things against their will. Once those words were spoken, no more were uttered until the thing she wanted done was done. She had tried to use those words on me a few times, but I don’t think they work on a Meekus. I’ll admit that I was moved, but it’s going to take more than words to make me do something. 

If the “For me” is accompanied by a tasty of some sort, then the words mean a lot more. Neil took his glowy toy out of his pocket and fumbled on the face of it with his fingers. Mommy had once again gotten her way, and she began to scratch the side of my neck as Neil walked into the front room while he spoke into his glowy toy. 

“Daddy’s sad Meekus.” She was talking to me. I loved it when it was just the two of us because Mommy always made sure to let me know what was going on with the family. “He lost his Mommy. But we’ll make sure he’s OK.”

This was the first time I had heard that Neil had lost his Mommy. I had never met his Mommy. If Neil’s Mommy was as wonderful as mine was, then I completely understood why Neil would be so upset.

At that time, I had no idea exactly how he lost his Mommy; at the time I just kind of figured someone had left a door open and she had gone to The Outside. I remember thinking that it was probably Neil’s Dad who had left the door open, because Neil had never had a kind word to say about him. I knew that with all of my problems with Neil, he was still a good enough Dad to never leave the door open to The Outside. 

A few days later, I realized that when they had said lost, what they really meant was that she had died. I had seen them do this trick with Misty a few years before when they told her that her bird, Mr. Farley, was lost. They let her believe that he had somehow been lost in The Outside. They never told her that I ate him. It’s not something I’m proud of, but Mr. Farley was a bastard who taunted me on a daily basis and ultimately, he was delicious.

I’ve looked to The Outside many times through my families legs as they ventured out into it, and I’ll admit that with all of its smells and sounds, it’s almost as tempting as a late afternoon snack, but the way I’ve heard my family talk about being lost in it, makes me afraid to even think about going out into it. 

Being lost is bad; probably the worst thing that can happen to a Meekus, and at that moment, I realized that it was also bad for Mommys. Once someone was lost, it was very hard to be found, and I wasn’t a fan of anything that was hard, except for my food. I like crunchy things.

“We’re going to have to go away for a little bit, but we’ll come back. You have to watch the house for us while we’re gone.” She always asked me to watch the house while they were gone, which was a hard job. Watching the house meant not sleeping as much. It meant looking after every noise to make sure nothing bad was happening. It meant being careful not to eat as much, because that weird man Mike may or may not give me enough in the mornings. It meant running from window to window if I saw Outside Meekus trying to get inside. He tried to get inside all the time, but he was more persistent when my parents were gone.

He was smaller than me, but he was fierce and he would yell at me through the window when everyone was gone, and then he would piddle all over the outside of our house as if it was his. I hated the black and white Outside Meekus. I would never go to The Outside simply because I didn’t want to be lost, but if I did eventually get up the courage to go past our door, I would find Outside Meekus and kick his ass. Then in an act of dominance, I would piddle on him to pay him back for all the nasty smells he put all over our house.

“Everything happens for a reason, Meeky. We just have to be optimystic, don’t we?” There it was. She was preaching. According to Neil, Mommy was The High Priestess of Optimysm.  “Daddy will be ok. He’s just lost right now.” 

I had no idea what she meant, he was just in the other room. 

“Go eat your food.” She put me down and scratched the top of my head. I watched her walk into the front room. She would be alright. She would see Neil standing there and realize that he wasn’t lost. It was then that I remembered the hat. With Mommy looking after Neil, I walked back into the laundry room, and as I walked, my front leg was hurting very badly. I was limping, and I could only hope that the limping went away, because the last thing I needed right now was to be taken to Magda and the Vetoffice. She messed with my butt.

The damn hat had slid under my food bin, which was good because Mommy hadn’t seen it, but it was bad because I wasn’t sure if I could get to it. There was a small piece of that beard that I was able to paw at until the whole thing slid out. I scooped that horrible thing up into my teeth and happily walked over to my poop box. I dropped the hat right in the middle of the box and I piddled on it until I couldn’t squeeze out another drop, and once I was done, I looked at the soggy ruin lying in the sand and buried only a small piece of it. The beard. 

I wanted Misty to know how displeased I would be if she were to ever even think of making me wear it again. Happy in what I had done, I limped back into the kitchen and treated myself to more hard-earned crunchies. That morning had been great, but my family left me later that same day. 

That sucked.

I can stay away from certain processed foods, spicy, chocolate, and tomato (sadly no pizza).
But to be super restrictive I can’t do that. Today my sugar went a little low and I ate bad things during breakfast. I do not have strong will power anymore I will admit after spending my entire life on diets by doctors as a child to lose weight and then eating disorders for the following years and most recently gestational diabetes. 

It’s hard to avoid triggers altogether perfectly for months to heal. Even a tiny slip up resets process due to pepsin for LPR. My symptoms are throat clearing and slight mucus 24/7. Very manageable and I’ve had them for about 12 years. First endoscopy 2 years ago showed mild gastritis in stomach.

I will continue to try and avoid bad foods as much as possible but I don’t feel I can be super restrictive as others are for this diet and I feel guilty about that since I’ve spent previous years starving for other stupid purposes.

I’m scheduling a follow up endoscopy next year 
As Gastro appointments are far away. I hate that I can’t commit to this but if I restrict myself it increases my desire for these foods. 

I’m usually a highly anxious person and now this has heightened my anxiety. I’m trying to remind myself that as long as I do what I can and follow up with doctors I’ll be fine and ignore those posts that shame people that don’t cure themselves by following the strict diet.",4,1763580917.0,LPR,3,1.0,False

It's a long one...

Yes, this long-time ambassador to the single red pill woman has gotten married… and we got married after dating for 9 months. I’ve done \*the impossible\* /s and gotten married for the first time **at 42** when according to RP men, I’m so far over the wall I can’t even see it anymore. I am not one of those people who think marriage has to be the goal for everybody or that getting married is in of itself is an achievement or badge of honor. But for me, yes I always wanted to be married and have a partner but I wanted it to be in a HAPPY and FULFILLING marriage or none at all. I asked myself all the questions over the years – am I being too picky? Do I need to settle for someone I’m not attracted to? Is something just wrong with me and I’m not the marrying type? Or am I just picking the wrong men, toxic men?

I had many long-term relationships, most notably one that lasted 7-10 years (off and on again clearly). My type was a dominant guy – the guy who would take charge of the relationship and make me feel secure, and yes, dominant in bed. And very often going for this type led me to men who did not have the best values or my best interest at heart. So this post it meant to help others out there in similar situations.

Now I am not your typical “trad” type – I have a high earning career that I don’t base my whole personality around but gives me the financial freedom to live the life I want. And I’m older so I have a long past of partners and flings and all of that. So if you have rigid thoughts about there being ONE right way to find a partner and it being very traditional, then my way and this post probably isn’t for you. But if you are being that rigid when searching into your 40s, I'd ask you to open your mind. My goal is to be real and not give some rose-colored version of how dating really is. So how did I go about finding my husband in my 40s:

**I. Don’t Give Up**

This sounds cliché but you have to be in it to win it. If you want it, there is no giving up. At 41 (when I met my husband), I had so many failed relationships under my belt of every kind. I had (somewhat) come to terms with the fact that I most likely would most likely never get married. I had for sure come to terms with that I wouldn’t have kids. Yet I knew I was still going to keep trying to find my person. If I never found it, I never found it, but I was going to try and I figured there were older men out there looking as well at all ages so being “over the wall” would just mean I’d need to compromise more (even though I ended up with a younger husband!)

**II. Taking Time Off**

When I met my husband, I had just come off a year of not dating. After a 1.5 year relationship ended at the end of 2023 that devastated me, I grieved for a very long time. In the past, I tended to jump back out there to date quickly after a breakup but this time, I realized that wasn’t healthy and gave myself some time to grieve. I did try to start dating immediately, realized I wasn’t at all ready, and then took a break that ended up lasting a year. My head was saying “you are old! You don’t have time to waste! Get out there!” but I just couldn’t.

What did I do during that year? Honestly not much. I won’t say I spent my time glowing up physically (actually the opposite) – I did a lot of reading, much on religion and self-help, did a lot of soul searching, spent some time in nature, and just isolated myself a lot. I am not saying this is the healthy way to go – it would’ve been better to hit the gym and hang with friends - but it was all I was capable of at the time and I just had to go through it. It eventually helped me discover who I was again and more importantly, who I wanted to be.

**III. Using Dating Apps Effectively**

I did meet my husband on Bumble. In fact we started talking in that phase where I got on the app right after my break up and then I decided I wasn’t ready to date. We connected, had a phone call and facetime call, had a date planned, and then I canceled. Yes I suck so bad. Yes I was very anxious and just not ready. So we stopped talking obviously.

Then about 6 months later, I texted him asking if he was still single and if he’d want to give it another try, and he graciously accepted. It was a simple coffee date in his neighborhood (in case I bailed again he said which, fair!) and the rest is history.

I can’t handle hearing women complain about dating apps. Yes they aren’t fun, I’ve used them now for decades, but they are a tool and you are wasting time if you don’t use all the tools at your disposal. So how did I maximize using apps?

* Only matched with people who had tagged or mentioned in bio they were seeking a long-term relationship or marriage. If they had nothing listed, I didn’t match. If it was casual or unsure or short-term relationship, I didn’t match. I was not going to fall for another guy who I had to then try to convince he wanted marriage.
* Only matched with people I was attracted to. In the past I went on dates with guys I wasn’t attracted to thinking it would grow and it never did. I didn’t want to burn myself out on dating this time so I decided to go on few, high quality dates and this meant going for only guys I found attractive. If it meant I didn’t date for months, then so be it (although that didn’t happen, I found my husband quickly).
* Required a facetime date first. I wanted to see him, hear him, and get an idea of the vibe before going in person. Could he drive the conversation? We also had a couple of phone calls first which I didn’t require but he initiated. So I knew him pretty well before a first date.
* Did not engage with men who weren’t driving the conversation. If he wasn’t asking me questions or moving things forward (asking questions about me, moving to ask for my number, ask to call me, ask for a date, etc.), I was out.

There’s tons of tips for using dating apps so that isn’t really the point of this post, but I wanted to share the basics. Will the above make your process long? Yes. But marriage is a long-term investment, it’s not about quick wins.

**IV. No Sex Before Monogamy**

People have very different views on when to have sex so just sharing my take – I decided to not have sex before monogamy. *NOW this did not play out the way you might think it would* *so hang on to your seats*… We became monogamous and had sex on the second date. If I could go back, I of course would have given it more time, but we were making out and things were progressing and I just stopped him and said I don’t sleep with people who are sleeping with other people. He stopped, looked shocked, said we needed to talk (and he wanted to put back on his shirt so it was more serious haha), and we sat and talked about it. He said he could commit to monogamy for now and we would see where things went. And that’s really all I needed. Every relationship before marriage is “for now” monogamy.

Now were we in a solid relationship on date 2? Absolutely not. Ideally we both wished we had given it more time and had been in a solid relationship with more meat on the bones before sleeping together but that’s not how it happened. I made my expectation known, he agreed, and from then on we were monogamous. OF COURSE we were dating and vetting each other along the way but I think my point here is sometimes we make more of the meaning of “monogomy” or “boyfriend/girlfriend” then what it needs to be. In the beginning it means “we are not sleeping with other people and we are committed to continuing dating ONLY each other,” and we both agreed to that, and it never changed from that day. And I think this move garnered him a lot of respect for me.

**V. Making It Known You Want Marriage**

Even before we met in person, I made it known I wanted to be married or at least was more traditional than many. This is one reason why the above approach on no sex before monogamy worked – he already had a heads up about who I was.

 This would come up casually in conversation where I would say things like “Yeah I don’t believe in living together before marriage” or “I don’t believe in dating for years and years before marriage” or “I have a somewhat traditional view on gender roles.” I was not talking about HIM or what HE had to do, I was telling him who I was. And most times he agreed with me. We both admitted we did things different in our past relationships and both felt it was not successful so both wanted to try a more traditional approach (I don’t love the word traditional here but can’t think of another one, maybe “old-fashioned”?).

**VI. Accept the Non-Perfect**

Now here is where the settling topic comes into play. I did not settle. My husband is a very successful entrepreneur (law firm owner), he’s fit and hot, younger than me (35), kind, sweet and thoughtful, and I adore him. But at 41, I knew things were likely to look different for me and that I may need to let go of some ideas of having EVERYTHING I wanted. And without listing all my husbands’ negative qualities, he has plenty of baggage that he comes with that would scare many women off. But I was remained focused on needing these things (and it may vary for you):

* Attraction (I wanted to adore him)
* Commitment (I wanted to see he was committed to the relationship and moving it forward)
* Being Treated Well (he was kind, not mean spirited, could work through conflict)

Beyond these, much of the rest I was open to. I’ve made many compromises for my husband, including selling my condo and moving out to his part of town so he can be close to his son and religious accommodations which I’ll mention below. And I did all of this in a very short time frame - less than a year. It was a calculated risk that I took thoughtfully and because of the commitment and consistency he showed.

**VII. The Role of Religion**

This deserves a call out and is where I will lose many people – I converted to his religion. I could write a post on just this alone but suffice it to say that it wasn’t a requirement on his part but it was a bonus; it was something I chose to do, felt inspired to do, and had thought about for the past 9 years before I met him. I believed and felt it was right but yes, I also did want to be the same religion as my husband. I wanted us to be able to partake in traditions together, I wanted our relationship to be rooted in God and shared values, and I knew it would very much help me connect with his family. Because everyone will want to know, I grew up very Christian>protestant>evangelical, let go of all faith when my dad died at 18, slowly grew into more agnosticism in my 20s, by my 30s did some dabbling in Islam and Catholicism before finally converting to Islam which is my husband's religion. We are quite progressive in our religion and are very much modern muslims (I’m a white midwestern American). 

And for me it is 100% the best thing I’ve ever done. It helps us navigate through decision making much more easily, I know it makes him value me more, and his mom and I are building an awesome relationship which wouldn't have been possible otherwise. This wouldn’t be the right path for everyone but for me it was like a puzzle that all fit together nicely.

**VIII. Making Marriage Happen Quickly**

Based on our religious beliefs, we both agreed that marriage should happen quickly. Neither of us would live together before marriage and we both felt odd about continuing with sex before marriage for long. In fact, we took a break in the months before marraige. So I freely admit without religion and it’s no sex before marriage restrictions, a quick marriage like this wouldn’t be necessary or likely. But in July at HIS request, we got out a pen and paper, came up with a plan for all the steps we needed to take to get married (selling the condo, prenup which was my requirement, finding a rental house for the first year, him moving, arranging a simple ceremony, meeting with a financial planner) and week by week we plugged away at it and got married in late September. We worked at our plan in a methodical way and taking each step gave us both more confidence in each other.

So what are the themes here after my long story? The highlights for women who are over the wall (here I’d say 30+) are:

* Persistence and resilience
* Self-Care
* Knowing what your deal breakers are BUT not having many deal breakers (be realistic)
* Standing your ground on your values
* Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want, especially in the initial online dating stages. Don’t have a scarcity mindset (e.g. Oh if I ask for xyz, he won’t do it and I’ll lose the connection). They will respect you for this.
* Men will like you over the wall (of course it goes without saying to look good) but they WILL come with more baggage (just as we ALL have more baggage with age) and you have to be realistic about that because it’s just life, none of us get through unscathed.
* Find someone who displays they want commitment every day. You really cannot force this and will waste time trying and break your own heart in the process. Find someone who wants to be married and makes that clear to you from very early on. And don’t waste time with them otherwise.

We are navigating the early days of marriage really well and I honestly cannot believe this happened to me. I wake up every day surprised at what my life is, that he is downstairs working away in OUR home, how it happened so fast, the fact that I now have a new extended family, and the absolute blessing I have been given in having this man who is literally exactly what I wanted.",3,1763580828.0,RedPillWomen,6,0.8,False

Every day I just want to call in sick, to tell my boss that i have some kind of stomach problem and I simply cannot work today. Its a thought I'd had every day before this happened and id always stuffed it down. I knew my parents wouldn't like me skipping work, they always tell me i need to be doing something if I'm not going to college yet.

I have to drive to work at four in the morning on unpaved, snowy roads, after scraping the snow off my shitty car which was not made for this weather. All i could think was how the hell did it start snowing all of a sudden? Just yesterday it was sunny, and dry, in a cold winterey sort of way. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  But when my alarm rang, I was greeted with a serene coat of white covering the world outside. I looked out at the serene beauty of nature with nothing but dread. My younger brother will almost certainly spend the whole day watching Minecraft videos on YouTube, since school will give him the day off due too the dangerous conditions. But unfortunately for me, my boss doesn’t care if I die.  
I drove through the freshly snow-covered roads out of the suburbs, past the small towns, into to the highway between two mountains, and arrived at the shitty little building in the woods where I worked. “Funkee Monkee Pizza.” I don’t know who the fuck was going to be getting pizza at this hour all the way out here, but this is my job.

Our job at Funkee Monkee Pizza is to make a pizza every hour. There always needed to be fresh pizza ready to be served to the few people who ever came to this fucking place out in the middle of nowhere. We don’t deliver so the pizza just rots in the display case until we are required to make a new one and throw the old one in the compost bin. The compost bin is unlovingly referred to as the “Bernard Bin” due to it having a photo of our boss, Bernard, with his wide smile, giving a “thumbs up” above a label reminding you to throw it out every two hours and that you would be severely punished if you ate any of it.  
(His name isnt actually Bernard, im giving all my co-workers nicknames for privacy.

I walked past two of my co-workers, Tom and Elijah, and into the break room, praying to god Tom didn’t say anything when I walked past him. I had been up until midnight scrolling twitter, so I wasn’t exactly running on a lot of energy. We keep a coffee machine in the employee break room, but you have to sign a sheet saying you drank from it and it would be deducted from your paycheck, along with a mandatory fee for milk and sugar even if you didn’t take any. Every once in a while, I try to sneak a cup while nobody’s looking.

Tom, my co-worker strolled right into the room as I was sneakily sipping my morning brew. I nearly had a heart attack but tried my best to play it cool. He looked at me and then the sheet before whispering “Look, Cass, could you please just stop doing that?”

“Hey, look, sorry. I just forgot to sign okay, I was going to do it after I finished.” I blathered out.

“Please, you know its against the rules, and Bernard says that if we see anyone breaking these rules, we are required to report it, and that makes me complicit, ya know. I don’t want to report you, but I also really don’t like going behind Bernard’s back like this.”

Tom was a Scrawny guy, looks about 25. Tom’s the type of guy who always has a big fucking smile that can really piss you off if you’re in the wrong mood. He’s always bringing doughnuts so other people will like him, and since everyone else seems to like him, I can never bring myself to tell him to shut the fuck up. He’s also the only person here who seems to like Bernard. He tells me that Bernard is friend of his family, which is what got him the job here. Every time I hear him speak he goes on and on about how much he loves this shitty job, about how satisfying it is to make a pizza and “serve up smiles” or whatever. He’s the only person whose “customer service smile” seems remotely genuine. Or maybe he’s just really good at faking it. Overall there’s nothing wrong with him as a person I guess I just find him really annoying.

I got on the floor and saw Elijah setting up the pizza oven. He turned to me, looked me in the eye and looked back at the oven without saying a word. Elijah had been working there longer than anyone else there. His employee tag said he was 42, but his face had the stress lines you would expect of someone at least 55. His slightly greying beard was scruffy and his hair was in dreads. He had deep sunken eyes, that looked like he had the life sucked out of them over the years. He wasn’t usually very chatty, I cant remember the last time I heard him speak to anyone outside of work duties. It was kind of hard for me to have an opinion on him.

Bernard arrived about half an hour late, but he’s allowed to do that because he wasn’t going to fire himself for it. Bernard is a man with a constant corporate smile that never quite semes to reach his eyes.

Bernard strolled, or more accurately waddled, up to us. His slim fit blue shirt and skinny jeans emphasizing his obese figure. His tie was a bright purple with a paisley pattern. Every day he seemed to have a new brightly colored tie with some crazy pattern that always looked stupid on him. He had a small coffee mug with the same photo from the Bernard bin plastered onto it. He gave one of those to all of his employees every Christmas as if that made up for not paying them anything above minimum wage. “Hey there Funky Monkeys, crazy weather today am I right?”

He looked to Elijah, the only black man in the room, and joked “Elijah, my homie, you’re looking like a real funky monkey today.” I have no idea if that was an intentional racist remark or if he’s just that fucking stupid.

Tom smiled “heya Bernard, we were wondering where you were.”

“Well look,” He said casually. “I have a little bit of a special task for you today, I know this isn’t what you’re used to… I need you to hide a dead body for me.”

I thought it was another one of his weird, unfunny jokes. And that he would reveal he was actually planning another one of those “team building exercises” he makes us do after closing time without pay. Tom and Elijah seemed more confused than anything. But all doubt was done away with when Bernard dragged the body in through the front and dropped it on the floor.

It was the naked corpse of an Asian man, slightly obese, maybe early thirties. “He wasn’t wearing any clothes when I found him.” Bernard mentioned glibly. His whole naked body, with every wrinkle, every hair, freckle or glob of fat was laid bare for all of us to see. He probably wouldn’t have been happy about that fact but maybe I can take solace in the fact that he’s too dead to care. The strangest part about it was the face, it was twisted and contorted into a frozen scream. One that didn’t die when he did. The cold freezing the echoes of his last moments of maddening terror. That ruled out him dying of the cold. If he had died of frostbite, he probably wouldn’t have done so screaming.

Tom was shaking, he looked like he was on the verge of tears. Elijah was just standing completely still, mouth slightly open and with the widest eyes I’ve ever seen. I was pacing around the room with my head in my hands muttering “What the fuck” over and over again.

Tom was the first to speak up “you… want us to like, hide this?”

Before Bernard could say anything I budged in “Who is this? Why can’t you just report this?” I wanted to ask “Did you kill him?” but I doubted Bernard would answer that honestly.

“Are you kidding me? If it gets out that somebody died anywhere NEAR our establishment, what do you think what that could do to business? for sales, for customers, for the property value? I guarantee everyone in the Funkee Monkee family is gonna make a lot less tips. Look, for all I know, someone could come looking for this guy any minute, now all we got to do is move the body deep into the woods, somewhere where it won’t be associated with us. We have a few hours where the snowstorm will hide our footprints and eventually someone will find it, far away from anywhere where it could be associated with us. Now, if you are unable or unwilling to fulfill your duties here, I understand completely, but it will result in termination of employment.”

Elijah’s eyes somehow got even wider before he finally spoke up “Where do you want us to put it?” he asked with a deep exhaustion in his voice.

I turned to him angrily “I’m sorry are you just okay with this?”

He glared at me with his tired, sunken eyes “No, not really… might was well get it over with.”

Bernard, still cheery as ever was tapping away on his phone. I’ll send you a maker on google maps for where I think it would be best to dump it, it’s just out in the woods. Bit of a hike but I’m sure it’ll be fine.” He turned to Tom and put his hand on his shoulder. “You’ll do this for me right Tom? It’s a heavy body so I’ll need all three of you to carry it.” Tom started trying to stammer out a response before Bernard kept going. “Look Tom, you’ve been my best employee for a few years now, and right now I’m giving you an opportunity to go above and beyond. After all I’ve done for you, surely you owe me this one favor.”

“You… we.. we’re just going to move the body right? Like we aren’t going to hide it really? nobody’s getting hurt. The families and everyone will still get closure, right?”

“Right! yeah Tom, that’s the attitude I want to hear. I knew I could count on you. Good boy!”

I could not fucking believe what I was hearing. I watched as everyone turned to me, expectantly. “Fuck you! No! I don’t want any part in this I…..” Their stares were burning into me, killing the words in my throat. There was no way I was going through with this, but they all wanted me to. “Don’t let us down Cass. We all need this.” Bernard said through his disarming smile.

“Cass, lets just get this over with.” Elijah chimed.

Tom didn’t say anything but gave me puppy dog eyes.

“Shut the fuck up, this is fucking illegal and... I… I… I just can’t.”

Bernard’s smile disappeared for a split second, before he put it back on and stepped towards me with his hands held open to me. “Okay I’ll admit this might not be entirely legal but do you know what? We here at Funkee Monkee are a family, and as a family we need to watch out for each other, isn’t that right you two?” My two co workers nodded glumly. “Now, if you don’t want to do this for us, then we might have to find some other explanation for the body, perhaps we could even say that you suddenly snapped and killed him. you wouldn’t want that would you? His mouth was smiling like always. But his eyes, usually dull and empty, were filled with contempt. “Now, that would still be bad for our business, but it would be much worse for you. Given that, I think it would be better for both of us if you do this for us. I’ll stay here and make the pizzas, capiche?”

 

And so that’s how I ended up out in the woods, shivering in the snowstorm at 7 in the morning carrying a dead body in a bag by the legs. Trudging my feet through the snow with my only real light source being the flashlight on Elijah’s phone. My winter clothes weren’t the greatest, but I still couldn’t do anything about it.

Everyone had been completely silent for almost the entire trip. which wasn’t unusual for me or Elijah but, definitely for Tom. I could see him in front of me, Holding up the body by the stomach, barley managing with his skinny arms. “So…. how much further?” he finally peeped up. Elijah, who was in the front holding up the shoulders, grumbled “I don’t know, I can’t get a signal out here, but last I checked we were about a third the way there, give it an hour and forty minutes.”

Bernard had given us coordinates to a spot to dump the body. It was deep into the woods and off the track of any hiking trails. I had a look at the map of the area and noticed the nearest building was another pizza place about a kilometer away.

“I still can’t believe you guys agreed to this so easily.” I told them. Elijah just chuckled while Tom started sputtering. “Hey, you agreed to this as well.”

“Yeah well we could have told Bernard to just do it himself. but you guys left me alone”  
Elijah turned back to give me a dirty look. “I have a kid Cass. I can’t lose my job, I’m already making minimum wage. A week without a paycheck will kill us. I know you go home to your mommy and daddy who let you live with them cook all your meals but I’m a fucking adult who has to actually work for a living.”

I spent the next 45 seconds silently trying to figure out how to respond to that before Tom tried to change the subject. “So… who do you guys think the body is exactly? Where did he come from?”

“I think Bernard killed him.” I said. “I don’t know why, or whether he’s done this before, but he definitely murdered him.”  
Elijah laughed again. “Nah, guy like him, You think he’s some kinda serial killer? Really? He’s a shithead but I don’t think he has it in him. If he did kill this guy, he probably hit him with his car on the way here. And now he’s trying to cover it up.”

Tom seemed weirdly mad at that. “You guys Bernard is a really nice guy if you get to know him, I understand that he does some bad stuff some time, but running a business is hard and he’s doing this for the sake of our jobs and…“

“Tom. Shut the fuck up.” Elijah said, something I’d wanted to say ever since I started working here.

Tom decided to change the subject again. “Do we even know how this guy died? I couldn’t see anything obvious on the body.”

As they were bickering, I felt something I had never felt before, like several alarms in my brain, that I didn’t know were there, going off suddenly despite no stimulus. I got an implacable feeling of being watched. I can’t describe it as anything other than that. I could see that Tom and Elijah felt it tooyeah as both of them had stopped and Tom was looking around nervously. That was when I heard the footsteps, just barley audible, with the snow cushioning the steps. they were coming from right behind us. I had to force myself to turn around. It took every ounce of courage I could muster.

There was the face of a man inches away from mine, way closer than the footsteps made me think. I jumped back screaming like banshee. Tom and Elijah jolted at the sound, dropping the body bag before turning to look at the man. The flashlight on Elijah’s phone lit up his features in the pitch darkness. He was a tall Asian man, with a broad frame wrapped in a yellow winter coat. Like Bernard, He wore a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. The man looked so familiar, familiar in ways I couldn’t place until… The realization felt like getting hit by a truck.

It was the corpse. It was the same fucking guy, he didn’t just look like he could be related.  He looked exactly like the corpse we had been carrying in a bag.

“Heya there.” He said “Its funny to see other people out here in this weather, huh?”

“Oh, uhh, yeah it is.” Elijah replied “What brings yyyyYYYYOOoouuuu……. Uh… out here?” I could hear in Elijah’s voice the exact moment when he noticed it too.

“Oh nothing haha, just enjoying the winter weather y’know. Hey, what’s in that bag you guys are carrying?”

 “Oh, just some supplies. For work.” Tom sounded completely calm and composed despite the situation.

Tom added “Yeah, yeah, our car broke down and y’know we have to carry all these supplies to work.”

I could feel my heart beating in my ears. Every cell in my body was telling me this guy was bad news, or maybe that was just the fear of getting caught. The more questions he asks the more he could tell to someone investigating the body once it gets found. but it was hard to focus on not getting caught when there was a much bigger issue at hand. I knew that whatever this was, I had to get rid of him.

“Well, we should probably get going, hope you have a nice day sir!” I said in my best customer service voice. Smiling through my teeth just like he was.

“Yes you’re right, I best be on my way, although I think I wouldn’t mind helping you guys carry that bag, it looks almost as heavy as me, haha.”

“Ohhhh… Nonono sir you don’t have to do that we wouldn’t want you to waste your hike through this lovely weather on us. we hope to see you again sometime.” Inside my head I was fucking begging him to just leave.

“oh sure, haha. Hey, where do you guys work by the by? I’d love to stop by there sometime.”

Tom answered before I could “Oh, just Funkee Monkee pizza. Look it up sometime. Bye!”

Idiot.

“Well, I’ll be seeing you around. Laters!”  He trudged off into the snow covered forest, footsteps much louder than they were when he was walking towards me. He turned back to look at us for a split second just as the darkness swallowed him up and he was gone. Him leaving felt like watching a storm pass. Elijah turned the light on his phone back towards the direction we were going. As im recounting this, I’m only now realizing he seemed completely unbothered by the light from Elijah’s phone shining right in his face.

 

We wandered deeper into the forest. the snow kept getting thicker, the sun was still absent. We still couldn’t find a spot where we could get a signal. Nobody seemed to want to discuss what the fuck just happened or who that was. If we had lost our way and were going in the wrong direction we would have no way of knowing. Tom said something about how a couple of trees looked familiar, but neither of us knew what to do about that. At that point I wasn’t sure how we would even know we were at the dumping spot when we got there. We saw a broken down abandoned cabin.

After who knows how long I felt Tom tap me on the shoulder before whispering.

“He’s following us.”

I began frantically scanning the dark forest, seeing absolutely nothing but snow covered trees. I whispered the message to Elijah. This seemed to agitate Tom, who I guess was hoping we wouldn’t speak aloud.

Elijah didn’t even bother whispering. “Who? The guy from earlier?”

“Yeah,” said Tom, “the guy from earlier, he’s trailing behind.”

Elijah scanned the trees behind us with his flashlight as I had, also finding nothing.

“What do we do?” I asked

Tom thought about it for a second. “I think we should have someone confront him while the others take the body away. Keep him distracted.”

The idea of being alone with that guy sent a chill down my spine. I couldn’t describe why or how. He was already creeping me out when we outnumbered him. “Bad idea. Bad fucking idea.”

Elijah nodded. “Yeah I don’t know about that, he gives me a bad vibe.”

Tom seemed absolutely taken aback. “What why? just cause he kind of looks like the guy who died?”

There was more to it than that, but I felt like I just couldn’t vocalize it in a way that made sense so I kept my mouth shut.

“Look, most likely, he’s related to the guy.” Tom whispered.  “He might be looking for him which could be a problem. If we distract him long enough to drop off the body, we can report it, giving him closure and hiding suspicion.”

“Do you think he suspects something about us?” Elijah asked. “Why else would he be following us?”

“Well, all the more reason to get him off of our trail. So keep your eyes out for him.”

Me and Tom both took out our phones for the flashlights. I hoped that deep seated instinct from before would start telling where he is, that primal feeling of being watched keeping me safe, but I felt absolutely nothing. Does that mean he isn’t here and I’m safe? I had no way of being sure. that was honestly more frightening than if I felt his presence.  Trudging through the snow now felt like we were prey being hunted by a predator. One that we don’t even know the nature of. We don’t even know where we were going. Just hoping we had been heading in the right direction. I did not like the idea of finding out we were going the wrong way and having to turn back, only to find him trailing behind us. Being the one in the back meant if he snuck up on us, I would be the first person he got to.

As we hiked I began to feel a little at ease, which might have been wishful thinking. I wanted to believe that he had left us alone and we could dump the body in peace. It was still so dark despite how long we had been out there.  After a while I heard Elijah stop and mutter. “Holy shit holy shit holy shit.” he was looking at something in front of us.

Tom started panicking, looking ahead. He and Bernard were blocking my view so I couldn’t see what it was.

I had to ask “is it him?”

“No,” Tom replied. “We got to tell Bernard about this when we get back, this is really bad.”

“What are you talking about? Who are you talking about?”

Tom and Elijah looked back at me before shifting to the side to give me a better view. There was another body lying in the snow. Up against a tree. It was covered in snow, but it looked naked, with a face frozen in a deep scream. Tom got out from under the belly of the body bag, leaving me and Elijah to have to support the weight. He ran up to the body. Examining it. “I think it’s uh… a woman, looks maybe….. 65? I don’t see any cuts or anything.” He began looking around with his phone scanning the snow until he saw it. A lump in the snow. I set down the bodybag by the legs before apolizing to Elijah. I inched towards the bump slowly, I got a feeling I recognized its shape. but I desperately hoped I was mistaken. I began to cautiously dig through the snow on top of the bump,  trying to scrape it with my gloved hands., as if the snow was trying to fight back against me. I was met with a dead blue screaming face, lit up by my phone. I turned to Elijah and Tom who were staring at me with dread.

“How many more? Do you think?” I asked.

Elijah sighed “Who knows. There could have been dozens that we just didn’t see.”

Tom was hyperventilating at this point “Oh God, Ohhhh god the the hell. W-what happened here how did they die? What is this?”

“I don’t know what you’re asking us for.” Elijah replied.

I asked “Do you think we could just leave the body here? There’s no way we are too close to the restaurant. It would be fine. We could send in an anonymous tip and they would find this body among the others.” Elijah suggested.

“I’ll ask him.” Tom said. I noticed his phone was dialing. I wanted to tell him no but he was already going.  “I got a small signal, I’m telling Bernard about all of this.”

“What the fuck is Bernard going to do? Come up with another insane, poorly thought out plan and then force us to stick to it, I don’t want to hear whatever he- “

Bernard’s blaring voice on the phone interrupted me.

“Hellooo, Funky Monkey Pizza. Just to clarify, we do not deliver, what can I do for you?”

“Heeeyy… It’s Tom, we found more bodies in the woods.”

“Shit, are they close to the restaurant?”

“yeah, like halfway away from the restaurant and the drop off point.”

“Well move them too.”

Tom was stunned. Elijah just groaned and rolled his eyes.

I sputtered out “What all of them?”

“Yes all of them. We can’t let a single body be found near our establishment!”  

I looked around the place. We had no clue how many bodies there even were. For all we know, there could have been hundreds of bodies buried in the snow that we didn’t see. and any body we missed that gets found would be blamed on us. Plus that guy was in the area, possibly watching us. I could already see Tom unzipping the body bag, dragging the body of the old woman into it.

“There’s a guy who might be stalking us.” Elijah mentioned. “We don’t know where he is but we saw him following us.”

Bernard paused for a second “Hmmm… yeah that does seem like quite the pickle, if anyone sees you doing anything with a body you would have to kill them haha.”

A silence hit everyone in the group like a truck. We were too stunned to say anything. the shock of what he had said left all of us shooting glances at each other hoping they would be the one to break the silence until Tom cracked.  “Uhh… Bernard are you, like, telling us to kill somebody. I- I don’t want to kill anyone, I think that’s a really bad idea.”

“WOAH! hold your horses there kiddo I’m not telling anybody to do anything. I’m just stating the obvious fact that if somebody saw you doing something illegal like this, your only real option would be to kill them y’know? After all, that’s the only way to stop all of us from going to jail since corpses don’t talk. Is it wrong to state facts?”

I could not believe what I was hearing. there is no way he thought any of us would buy that. Then again its not like I could think of a better solution if someone sees us. “Yeaahh… we um, know how being dead works.” Although given what I had seen today I might not be sure about that.

“Good” Bernard said “So we’re on the same page then.”

“uh… Are we??”

Elijah chimed in “I think we are.” Me and Tom looked at each other, hoping the other knew what to make of that.

“Alright, you two keep your eyes peeled for anyone who might be watching us alright.” Elijah was speaking to me and Tom like we were his personal soldiers.

Tom hung up and looked at Elijah, “We aren’t killing anyone alright. we can find another way to deal with it.”

“When did I say I we were going to kill anyone?” Elijah asked. there was an apprehension in his voice.

We still had to do our jobs though. I thought about running away right then and there, but I was already doing something illegal with three witnesses. If I leave, then Tom would be alone with Elijah, but if me and Tom outnumber him, maybe we could stop anything to drastic from going down.

And then we could spend half of our lives in jail. I didn’t know what the penalty for this is exactly, but I knew it wasn’t good. I don’t know how we were going to convince anyone who sees us not to talk but I knew we had to try. It’s better than the alternative. If there was ever a point where I had a choice here, I missed it.

Tom tried stufffing the old woman’s body into the bag with the other one, but decided it would be too heavy. We decided it would be better to take the bodies one at a time. we had no clue how long that would take but we hoped there wouldn’t be any more bodies.

Suddenly Elijah shouted. “Over there!”

I couldn’t see anything, but was looking off into the trees at something I couldn’t see. I thought it was another body at first but that hope was quickly put to rest.

“It’s someone watching us. Not the guy from earlier, it was a woman. She was behind that tree.” Elijah began to sprint towards where he thought he saw our stalker. me and Tom exchanged knowing glances.

“Hey Elijah, what are you going to do to her?” Tom pleaded.

“I just want to talk with her.” by the sound of his voice I don’t think he did. He began pacing around a tree. “Where the hell are you?” Definitely not. His attention jolted towards another tree that I wasn’t looking at. “What the hell?” He ran towards a different tree. “She was just behind this tree didn’t you see it?” I looked around trying to see who he was talking about, until I saw an old woman peeking out from behind a tree next to the one Elijah was looking around. She was smiling. Her features looked subtly familiar until I realized who it was, I turned back to look at the screaming body of the old woman. It was the same woman. Just like the Asian man we met before, the corpse that was lying there screaming looked just like her. I froze in terror before looking back to the old woman who was now looking at me. She was wearing a yellow winter coat and had her mouth contorted into a smile showing all her crooked teeth her eyes were wide open and yet it was like I couldn’t see anything beneath them. I looked to Tom, he saw her too. Eliah turned around and noticed her and jumped in shock, falling back and dropping his phone. She ducked her head behind the tree, hiding herself completely from us.  “Do something you dumb shits, get her, she’s running away. I couldn’t see her running behind the tree but I took his word for it. Tom ran up to Elijah and grabbed him by the arm.

Tom pleaded with him “Stop! Stop It, What are you doing. We aren’t killing any-” Elijah punched him square in the face, knocking him on his ass in the snow. Elijah didn’t say a word before running off into the darkness, the light from his phone bobbing up and down as he ran through the pitch black darkness.

I checked on Tom who was groaning. There was blood from his nose leaking onto the snow he looked up at me and yelled “Stop him, please!”

I ran off towards where I thought Elijah had gone, until I saw his flashlight scanning the trees. desperately around him. I picked up a large tree branch and held it like a club.

“What the fuck do you think your doing?” I screamed at him.

Elijah turned his head towards me, shining his phone directly in my eyes like a flashbang. “That woman’s old, she’s lived a full life. My Daughter hasn’t.” I didn’t even know if that old woman was alive, or human. “I don’t know how the hell she’s so fast though. HELP ME LOOK FOR HER.”

“Th-that woman.” I replied “She looked exactly like the corpse of the old woman we found screaming

Elijahs eyes widened. “oh shit, just like the…” I could see gears turning behind his eyes, each rotation causing his eyes to grow wider and wider, his lips starting to quiver.

We were cut off abruptly by an ear-piercing scream. It echoed through the forest like the call of an animal but it was distinctly a human scream. It was Tom. Elijah and I sprinted back to where we had left tom. We were running like a deer that had been seen by a wolf. when we got to where we remember leaving Tom, he wasn’t there. The other bodies weren’t there either. We were frantically scanning our flashlights around, trying to find where tom left them, but we saw absolutely nothing except the empty body bag.

“Tom!” I screamed out. “Tom what happened?” I couldn’t see any footprints around. despite the snow, there would still be some footprints visible to us if Tom had wandered off. there was nothing indicating the three bodies were dragged away

“I don’t think Tom’s here Cass,” Elijah responded “I think whatever that thing is, it took away all the “dead bodies while we were distracted.”

“You think it took all three bodies on its own just like that?” I snapped

“I think it took all four bodies just like that yes.” Elijah looked at the ground solemnly.

Elijah looked at the blood in the snow from where he had punched him. “Maybe she got him because we left him weak and vulnerable. I knocked him on his ass and you left him alone.”

I began to shake uncontrollably, crying. “TOM PLEASE CAN YOU HEAR US?” I was met with no sound but the constant droning blizzard and wind that I had been listening to all morning. I don’t know what I was crying about, I didn’t even like Tom all that much. “WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU MAN?”  I looked to Elijah with tears in my eyes. “This is all your fucking fault you know that.”

Elijah shrugged. He was looking down at the ground he was hiding his eyes from me “Can’t do much about it now.” There was a crack in his voice. He looked at the body bag for a second. “I say we just take this back and say we dumped all the bodies at the sight. We don’t know what else we can do.

I was keeping my distance from him, tree branch in hand

He checked his phone before walking off in whatever direction it told him the restaurant was. He looked back at me and said “I don’t feel like staying in this forest any longer.”

For the rest of the walk back we didn’t say a word to each other. I kept looking around for signs of someone watching us but there was nothing. It was about 11AM so we could finally see without flashlights. Around every tree, rock and bush I expected to see someone watching us, to see the Asian man, the old woman, or even Tom smiling at us. But somehow we were left alone the entire time. Maybe whatever it was had it’s fill. Or maybe it was trying much harder at hiding itself. So all I had to keep me company was the silent Elijah trailing behind me and my own thoughts. My mom had taken me hiking in some woods near here when I was a kid. so these woods had always felt so safe and comforting up until now. When I finally saw the warm glow of FUNKEE MONKEE’s PIZZA just as it felt like my legs were going to give out from all the walking it was like seeing a lighthouse. I had never before been happy to see this place.

I there were no cars outside except the employee owned ones. I ambled into the empty pizzeria, I slumped down on the nearest chair to the entrance, throwing off my winter coat and taking time to catch a breath. Elijah came in after me and did the same. My legs felt almost numb, at this point. after all that had happened my body yearned for the opportunity to just sit down and not do anything. The pizza ovens warmed up the place quite nicely.  I wanted this brief reprive to last forever. I saw the no smoking sign taunting me from the wall. I looked to the pizza stands, with their shitty, greasy pizza shimmering from the lights. I collapsed down on a three seated round table next to the front door. Elijah came in after me and sat across from me, leaving the third seat empty.

“you’re not out of the woods just yet!” Bernards voice called.

“what?”

He stuck his head out from inside the kitchen. He was eating one of the doughnuts Tom brought “gotta get to work, remember? You are still on the clock.” He pointed to a clock on the wall with a sticky note on it that read **You** in big bold letters. Bernard was smiling from ear to ear at his hilarious joke.

I sat in silence for a few seconds, not wanting to move before I mumbled. “Tom is dead.”

“What?”

“Tom is dead. he died out there.”

“Oh…” Bernard said it with the same tone as if I told him there was a dead skunk in the parking lot. “well shit.”

 

The story Bernard came up with for Tom’s disappearance was he turned off the security cameras (right around the time Bernard came in with the body, which is why there’s no footage after that point) and started trying to steal all the money from the cash register, only to get caught by his employees and run off into the woods, never to be seen again. The police bought it as far as I can tell.

It's been a week since then. Elijah brought his daughter in on his day off. She’s 7 years old, cute kid. She seemed so happy to be here, even though the pizza crust felt like cardboard and the cheese tasted like plastic, and it was covering the sourest marinara you’ve ever tasted, she gobbled it up like it was fine dining. Elijah was unusually chatty that day, and at one point, while he was talking with one of my other co workers, he looked directly at me with his tired eyes mid conversation and said, “yeah you know, I work hard to feed her, it would be a shame if anything were to threaten my employment.” His eyes were practically burning into my flesh there before he just looked back at my co-worker, continuing his conversation as usual. That was the last time I heard him speak to me about anything other than work duties.

The hardest part of all of this is probably the fact that even after all of this, I still have to go to work tomorrow. I still have to drive into those woods every day, and walk along the floor where a dead body was dumped, and see Tom’s employee of the month portrait on the wall, and sometimes even see Elijah working the shift with me. And every day, Bernard is there, to give me his big empty corporate smile. I’ve considered telling the authorities what happened that day, but even if they would believe me, I would be implicating myself as well, and its my word against Bernard and Elijah's. I guess I'm only telling this to you guys now because i want the truth to be somewhere.

After looking into it, I found a ton of missing persons in that area. I found the old woman, who went missing three days prior. and the Asian man was reported missing a few days after Bernard found him. Still it’s impossible to tell if every missing person in this town was because of whatever I met in those woods but there are a lot of them that all seem to begin with someone going hiking there alone. Needless to say I don’t plan on going back in the woods anytime soon.

According to INC doctrine, even their own members who wish to read, study, and analyze God’s word cannot independently understand the Bible without a minister.

And once again I was able to get away with a simple, 3-ingredient cocktail!

The G.O.A.T. of all Thyme Martini:

1.5 oz Goat Cheese Washed London Dry Gin

0.75 oz Cocchi Americano

0.5 oz Spiced Raspberry Shrub

Shake with ice and strain into a chilled martini glass.

Garnish with either blue cheese stuffed olives or blue cheese stuffed raspberries (or both!)

Video with better instructions and the other cocktails that almost made the contest:

[https://youtu.be/RIdw1yxJn-0](https://youtu.be/RIdw1yxJn-0)



Taste:  The Goat Cheese I used was particularly mellow, so it really toned down the Gin and added a nice creaminess to the cocktail, and the Shrub, which is usually very tart, just adds a mild zing with these nice underlying tones from the fruit and the spices.  I wish the Lavender was more prominent, because I think it would have paired very well with the Cocchi and the Gin, and next time I’ll probably double the amount I use in the shrub.

Shrub:

1 cup Sugar, 1 Cup Aged Sherry Vinegar, 1 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar, 2 Tbsp Lavender, 1 tsp Clove, 1 tsp Black Peppercorns, 1 bit of Fresh Thyme, Peels of 3 Lemons, Fill remainder with Raspberries, top with two slices of Pineapple, fill to top with more vinegar, seal and store in the fridge for about a month before straining out the solids.  Lightly crush the raspberries while straining to get out any remaining juice.  Think of this recipe as a template, and feel free to add or subtract as you see fit.

Goat Cheese Washed Booze:

\~2-3 oz Goat Cheese and \~2 Cups Booze (Gin in this recipe).  Leave to infuse on the counter, shaking occasionally.  Put in the freezer overnight to separate, and strain through a coffee filter.",5,1763580510.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

For the moment I've been using a Baratza Encore and while I think it's a great bang for the buck grinder, I know I need to invest in a higher quality daily grinder sooner than later.

On average, I make 2 pour overs every day. First pour over of the day is a Chemex so I can make enough coffee for both my wife and I. My second pour over of the day is made in a ceramic V60 (my favorite way to make coffee for the last 10 years or so). The beans I use tend to be light roasts, every now and then I'll dip into the lighter side of medium as well.

Any recommendations are welcome, I don't want to spend more than $500 - $600 if possible but when it comes to coffee I'm easily swayed for better and for worse.

I have been trying to move states so I know this current relationship is not something we have agreed to make extremely serious.  I have asked questions about his previous relationships and other things. He gets really defensive and angry when I ask anything. I have heard from him he has this female friend who he babysits her child and he has admitted to helping her buy a car. I have noticed he has been a lot less engaged with texting and our dates are much shorter. I also have noticed he has been extremely mad when I ask if he is seeing anyone else.  I have communicated that it is ok to see others as long as we use protection and the person is tested etc. I honestly do not mind if it's another causal dynamic as long as they are being safe sexually. I feel concerned I'm in a home wrecking situation. I feel like he maybe in a serious relationship or engaged or something. Am I being paranoid or do you sense that I could be onto something.

Here's my process:

1. Two-1lb bags, ground coarse at the roaster's shop. I just have them do it because 99% of the time I'm going right home to brew and it's way faster than my small electric grinder.
2. Brew in a Toddy Cafe Series 10 Liter brewer with the paper bags cinched closed. 
3. Countertop brew for 22-24 hours...sometimes 25 or 26 depending on my schedule/memory the next day. I never agitate the beans or the cinched bag
4. Drain into 3gal keg
5. Add water to fill the keg. Usually I'll run this water through the Toddy and the bag of beans to kind of rinse off whatever is possibly left in the Toddy. It's entirely possible that this here is my mistake, but it's nice getting as much coffee out as possible.
6. Into the kegerator, with 10psi of Nitrogen just to push it out. I prefer flat cold brew to nitrogenated. 

This produces really, really good cold brew. I like it a lot. I know I'm splitting hairs here, but I just can't get to the grade of some of my favorite big city coffee shops (like Birch Coffee or Stumptown or Intelligentsia). It baffles me that the beans can sit in a bag, then sediment can settle in the Toddy, then it can settle in the Keg, and I still wind up seeing a little in the glass. Thoughts? Tips?

Here’s how it went:

1. **Meditation**: Sat cross-legged on the floor, trying to channel my inner zen. Ended up channeling my inner ""why did I skip leg day?"" instead. 

2. **Affirmations**: Repeated “I am powerful and unstoppable” while simultaneously contemplating whether I should order breakfast or just wait for lunch. 

3. **Nature Walk**: Took a stroll outside to connect with Mother Earth. She seemed to be saying, ""Can you keep it down? I'm trying to grow some trees here!"" 

4. **Gratitude List**: Wrote down three things I’m grateful for, but only managed to think of two. Gotta love that third spot pressure! 

5. **Spiritual Selfie**: Captured the moment with a filter so bright, I might just blind my followers. #BlessedAndBlurred

1p1gyv2,https://linktr.ee/universityexploitsbyjx,The TOEFL iBT Master Blueprint: Your Protocol for Academic English Dominance & Top-Tier University Admission,"**The Premise: The Gatekeeper of Global Academia.**  
The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT) is not a simple vocabulary quiz; it is a rigorous simulation of university-level performance. It is the definitive barrier between ""knowing English"" and demonstrating the capacity to survive in a rigorous North American academic environment. Treating the TOEFL like a casual conversation class—relying on intuition and Netflix subtitles—is how otherwise brilliant students end up with sub-100 scores and rejection letters. The winning approach is to reverse-engineer ETS’s (Educational Testing Service) scoring rubrics: deconstruct the four distinct psychometric pillars (Reading, Listening, Speaking, Writing), master the ""Integrated Tasks,"" and pressure-test your ability to synthesize information until academic articulation is a reflex, not a translation effort.

**At a glance (Core Components):**  
**The Four Pillars:** Reading (Rhetorical Analysis), Listening (pragmatic understanding), Speaking (structured delivery under time pressure), and Writing (synthesis and argumentation).  
**Integrated Tasks:** The critical skill of combining domains—reading a passage, listening to a lecture on the same topic, and then speaking or writing about the relationship between the two. This is where most candidates fail.  
**The Note-Taking Engine:** Your ability to rapidly filter auditory data into a skeletal structure on scratch paper. If you cannot transcribe logic while listening, you cannot answer.  
**The Algorithm & Human Hybrid:** Understanding that your Speaking and Writing are graded by both AI (SpeechRater/e-rater) for mechanics and human raters for content/coherence.

You leverage this validated competency to secure visa approvals, gain admission to Ivy League or Russell Group universities, and obtain professional licensure (Pharmacy, Dentistry, Nursing).

**The Challenge: Four Score-Killing Traps That Derail Smart Candidates**

**1. The ""I Speak Fluent English"" Fallacy**  
Your ability to order coffee in New York or chat with friends on Discord proves you have conversational fluency (BICS), but it does not guarantee you possess academic proficiency (CALP). The TOEFL does not test if you can chat; it tests if you can summarize a lecture on Astrobiology or 19th Century Art History while synthesizing a counter-argument. Relying on ""gut feeling"" for grammar is a fatal error. The exam tests specific rhetorical structures and formal logic, which differs significantly from casual speech.

**2. The ""Passive Consumer"" Approach (The Output Void)**  
Studying by only reading books or listening to podcasts is a recipe for failure. The TOEFL is an active exam. The Speaking and Writing sections require production under extreme time constraints (e.g., 15 seconds to prepare, 45 seconds to speak). Passive input builds recognition; the exam tests output generation. You must train your brain to formulate arguments instantly.

**3. The ""Template Zombie"" Syndrome**  
Memorizing generic templates from YouTube (""First of all... Secondly... In conclusion..."") without understanding why they work leads to low scores. ETS raters are trained to spot memorized, low-content responses. If your template obscures your content, or if you force a square peg into a round hole, your score will cap at 22-23. You need flexible frameworks, not rigid scripts.

**4. The ""Endurance Collapse""**  
Since the July 2023 update, the test is shorter (under 2 hours), but the intensity is higher. Every question counts more. Many candidates fail not because of language barriers, but because of cognitive fatigue. If you lose focus during the Listening section, you cannot replay the audio. A momentary lapse in concentration can cost you an entire passage set.

**The High-Score Protocol: A System for Peak Exam-Day Performance**

**Phase 1 — Diagnostic Baseline & Strategic Planning**  
Objective: Eliminate guesswork; align prep to the ETS Official Rubrics.

* **Define Your Target Score:**
   * **Undergraduate:** Usually 80+ (total).
   * **Top-Tier Grad School (Harvard, Stanford, MIT):** Typically 100+ (with specific minimums like 25+ in Speaking).
   * **Licensure (Pharmacists/Nurses):** Strict speaking minimums (often 26+). Know your ""Hard Floor.""
* **Execute a Diagnostic:** Take a free TPO (Test Practice Online) mock test from an authorized provider to find your ""Red Zones."" Are you failing to finish the Reading? Or are you freezing on the Speaking?
* **Build a Pipeline:** If your Speaking score is 19, do not spend 3 weeks on Reading. Front-load your weakest active skill.

**Phase 2 — Domain Mastery & Note-Taking Fluency**  
Isolate → Master → Integrate.

* **Note-Taking Boot Camp:** Spend the first week mastering your shorthand. You should be able to outline a ""Problem/Solution"" lecture without looking at your paper. Use symbols (↑ for increase, ≠ for contrast, b/c for because).
* **Vocabulary Drills (AWL):** Master the Academic Word List (AWL). You need to know words like ""mitigate,"" ""substantiate,"" and ""empirical"" instantly.
* **The ""Speaking 45"" Drill:** Force yourself to record 45-second responses to random prompts. Listen to them. If you pause for ""uhhh"" more than twice, re-record. Train for ""continuous flow.""

**Phase 3 — Full-Spectrum Simulation & Algorithm Alignment**

* **The ""Academic Discussion"" Pivot:** Master the new ""Writing for an Academic Discussion"" task (introduced July 2023). This requires you to read a professor's post, read two student responses, and contribute to the conversation in 10 minutes. This is a speed-typing and synthesis test.
* **Weekly Mocks:** 3-4 weeks out, take full-length practice exams. This builds the mental stamina required to maintain focus.
* **Error Analysis:** When you miss a Reading question, categorize it:
   * Vocab Gap: ""I didn't know the word.""
   * Inference Error: ""I assumed too much outside the text.""
   * Distractor Trap: ""I picked the answer that used words from the text but distorted the meaning.""

**Your Resource Trinity (Quality over Quantity)**

**Official Docs (The Canon):**

* **The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT Test (ETS):** The source of truth.
* **Official TOEFL iBT Tests (Volumes 1 & 2):** Real past exams. Nothing beats authentic data.

**Focused Tooling (The Toolkit):**

* **TST Prep (Josh MacPherson):** Widely regarding as the gold standard for updated, realistic practice questions and templates.
* **GregMat:** Excellent for deep-dive rhetorical analysis and vocabulary building (originally GRE, but highly effective for TOEFL).
* **Notefull:** The OG of Speaking mastery.
* **Hardware:** A desktop computer with a mechanical keyboard and a wired headset. Do not practice on a phone. You must simulate the test center environment.

**Targeted Communities (The Forge):**

* **Reddit:** r/ToeflAdvice — The hub for recent exam trends and specific question help.
* **Discord:** TST Prep and other study groups for finding ""Speaking Partners.""

**8-Week Accelerator (The Roadmap)**

* **Weeks 1-2 — Foundation & Reading/Listening:** Master the question types (Insert Text, Prose Summary, Detail). Build your vocab bank. Practice note-taking on TED Talks.
* **Weeks 3-4 — Speaking Mechanics:** Focus on Questions 1 (Independent) and 2-4 (Integrated). Record yourself daily. Work on pronunciation and intonation (the ""music"" of English).
* **Weeks 5-6 — Writing Strategy:** Master the Integrated Writing (Reading/Listening synthesis) and the Academic Discussion task. Practice typing speed—aim for 30+ WPM with high accuracy.
* **Week 7 — Integration & TPO:** Stop doing single-topic questions. Switch to full TPO (Test Practice Online) sets. Simulate the inability to go back in the Listening section.
* **Week 8 — Peak & Deploy:** Light review. Review your ""cheat sheet"" of transition words and templates. Sleep. Hydrate. Visualize the 30/30.

**Why This System Works**

* **Prioritizes Integration:** It forces you to connect Reading and Listening, mirroring the actual university experience.
* **Beats the Algorithm:** It trains you to use the sentence structures and vocabulary variety that the e-rater algorithm rewards.
* **Builds Stamina:** It turns the exam from a marathon into a manageable process, preventing the ""brain fog"" that kills scores in the final Writing section.

**Quick Start Checklist (Do These Tonight)**

1. Create an ETS account and check test dates in your region (Home Edition vs. Test Center).
2. Purchase ""The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT"" (ensure it is the latest edition reflecting July 2023 changes).
3. Download an Audio Recorder app on your phone for Speaking drills.
4. Join r/ToeflAdvice and search ""Exam Experience"" to see recent prompts.
5. Take a free ETS diagnostic test to set your baseline.

**FAQ**

**Q: Is TOEFL harder than IELTS?**  
A: It is different. IELTS (Academic) is more traditional/human-centric. TOEFL is 100% digital and integrates tasks more heavily. If you are uncomfortable speaking into a microphone or typing fast, TOEFL is harder. If you have bad handwriting or struggle with human interviewers, TOEFL is easier.

**Q: Should I take the Home Edition or go to a Test Center?**  
A: **Go to a Test Center if possible.** The Home Edition has strict proctoring protocols. If your internet drops or you look away from the screen, your exam can be terminated. Test Centers provide a controlled environment and eliminate technical liability.

**Q: How does the new ""Writing for an Academic Discussion"" work?**  
A: It replaced the old ""Independent Essay."" You have 10 minutes to read a prompt and write a 100+ word contribution to a class forum. It tests your ability to be concise, conversational yet academic, and fast.

**Q: What is a ""good"" score?**  
A:

* 80-90: Acceptable for most state universities.
* 90-100: Competitive (Top 50 universities).
* 100-110: Ivy League / Top Tier competitive.
* 110+: Elite / Instructor level.

1p1gyu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1p1gyu8/miss_what_i_thought_i_had_with_her/,Miss what I thought I had with her,"Sorry for posting so often.

She was the host of all the shows in my area. Now she doesn’t feel comfortable with me going to them, and walks out of the room at the one show that isn’t hers, because her stomach drops and she doesn’t feel “safe”. My lease isn’t up until next year, but I’m going to have to leave my hometown if I want to shed this feeling I fear.

I had admired her for a while, and fought the urge to act on my crush on her because I valued the community so much. I had friends and a hobby I was passionate about, something I could do and grow in each week.

When I got laid off for a second time this year, after living in my car last year, I quit my boxing gym and doubled down on performing at shows in my area (she hosts almost all of them). I think stress and not having a lot of my time filled out had led to my crush turning into an incessant limerence for her. None of her flaws or red flags occurred or mattered to me. I was obsessed, and had friends I spoke to in the scene confiding that I might have to finally tell her because I just felt compelled to. 

We had grown slightly closer over time. She knew my name, but would later tell me she just viewed me as a number on the list of signups. We had conversations about it depression. She asked if I was dating and it killed me not to tell her then.

She had sent a message to the group chat that had apparently been meant to be sent to her female group chat about trying to get guys on dating apps to set up furniture for her in her new condo. I used that as my in to offer my services. I figured I could work up some brownie points, because I really just assumed she would reject me, and that I could respectfully disappear from the mics for a few months and return back to normal.

Unexpectedly, she FaceTimed me when she was away on a work trip, and I asked her out. It’s like she knew. She was doing her hair, and realized she had a crush on me. I was head over heels and asked her out to dinner when she came back. She said yes.

I honestly hadn’t prepared to get to that point. Honestly, this is where I’ll need to work on boundaries, recognizing limerence and whatnot. Very quickly our cutesy convo turned into some minor sexting with her saying she wanted to have sex with me.

Our first date was amazing. Morning coffee, cute kiss at the end. The kind of innocence and pace I dreamed of. She made me so happy.

Before our next date (quick aside: the coffee date was before our first date- we just both really wanted to see each other), she then laid on that she wasn’t able to be too emotional right now. She said I was a catch, but was very “go go go” in her life right now. And had even mentioned that on a previous date with a guy, she knew right away she wasn’t interested in him and told him, and he said he felt like an idiot and she got this tight ball in her stomach. I vowed to never cause that in her (spoiler I did and I hate it so much).

So, after our second date I figured that was probably it. I would finish setting up her furniture and go back to focusing on my job search. Instead, the next night we had sex.

Super hot and cold, right? 

Immediately after sex, there was no cuddle. She instantly regretted it. She had that tight ball in her stomach. She asked me not to tell anybody in the scene we hooked up. I felt awful, but I agreed.

Two days later at the next mic, I played it cool, downplayed our dates to a friend and essentially lied in my own right by not telling a friend what I might have otherwise. At the end of the night she said she totally told her people. That’s so crazy to just set that boundary and violate it. But I was happy she told people I guess.

Throughout the month we hooked up but she didn’t have a label on it. Previously I had offered to go slow but she didn’t want that commitment. As you can see, regardless of the issues she continued, I chose to look past “can’t provide emotion”, the inconsistencies, becoming emotionally drained and feeling like I was walking on egg shells by the end of the month. I was limerent and in love with her.

Anyway, after losing her phone and having a medical flare up, she said she wasn’t feeling the hookup thing anymore. I asked if we were just friends and she didn’t want to put a label on it. A few weeks at shows and she’s being loud about being single. I started to not be able to play it cool and would avoid her and she would notice. I wasn’t trying to it was just my buddy, like I couldn’t handle the rejection and pain and heartbreak.

Anyway, I went to a show at the town over (this would be around three weeks after we stopped dating) and she was officially going out with that guy she mentioned not being interested in.

I was so fucking hurt. I impulsively rage blocked so many dozens of people because social media addiction (I e stalking / checking profiles) is an issue I have when I get obsessed and I tried to nip it in the bud. But emphasis on impulsive, I was hurt. I should have found a friend to hold my phone and let me cry. But I felt crazy, like raged, just so hurt like I’ve never felt before.

I found out at the show one city over by overhearing. In the following weeks, I was so sad. Crying. Venting to my friends who I was closest to in the scene. One other closest friends who I thought she mentioned telling, she got mad at me because I the day after blocking people I unblocked and messaged him through text just saying I was doing it to remove myself from the obsession and it was nothing personal when he saw me. But it got back to her and she felt like I told everybody.

She didn’t even date the guy for more than a month. They were official. She had told me during our dates that the next time she dated a guy it would be a “this is it” relationship, which is why I was so hurt. She’s already dated at least two guys since us in May.

I acted poorly. When she asked me to stop bringing up her name to other people in the scene, I reacted defensively. I had no job at the time. My unemployment was running out. I had no money, and I wasn’t even sleeping anymore. I felt horrible and had suicidal ideation because I just couldn’t escape it and had nothing to do. My older friends are married with kids. They have their shit together and in these ways I don’t. I’ve made close friends in the scene and I went to them. I also admit I grieved publicly (not at the shows but I frequent a cafe nearby), so I understand her but also how she went about it was so painful.

She compared me to her bf. Blamed me for having to tell him because “I told everybody”. Would change the subject when I said I didn’t tell everybody and that she told people first. She said “look how bad you made this for me” and that’s truly one of the worst days of my life.

So I told her I might not be able to abide by her request other than blocking and not being in the scene anymore. She tried to give me an out to just chill, but I was literally crazy with anguish and heartbreak. I tried to over explain and understand and be understood but I just felt so hurt and not cared about.

About a month later I unblocked and asked if I could return to shows. I missed them so much, but I accepted that I fucked it all up and apologized to her. She said she didn’t really feel safe or comfortable and that she wasn’t gonna tell me either way to go or not and to stop putting it on her to decide. Man I fucked up so bad.

So I avoided her main mics, started going to outside places, and returned to the one mic she doesn’t host, and the one she puts together but doesn’t host.

She would always leave my sets. I could tell the time for “just have the decency to look me in the eye and say hello” had past and that she just couldn’t even stomach being in the same room as me. Which I didn’t feel was fair but I don’t think fair matters here.

In October, her dog was saying and she said she had put up with it as long as she could but had asked me to stop going and to find other mics - even the one she didn’t host.

I asked her to practice empathy and she called that manipulative. She said her dog was dying (that’s when I found out) and that these were mics… mics…

It’s the most terrible feeling ever to have a woman say to you that she doesn’t feel safe or good with you around. To be clear, when she says safe I think of attachment styles and pressure. I’ve literally never gone up to her since this all happened, and we were on okay terms until I found out she was dating somebody officially. Everything bad has happened through next, and as if it were going to happen, she said maybe a conversion in 2026 if the vibe was different. It’s so cooked.

She’s out there living her life and I’m suffering here. It’s not fair. I’m happy she’s not unhappy but it’s hell that she’s probably only unhappy when she sees me at that one show. I think I’m going to go to it one last time and have to stop going. And when my lease is up, move out of my hometown to move closer to other shows so I can perform and commute less.

This entire town reminds me of her. I am in so much pain. I am so sad that my actions led to this. Even if she’s unaccountable, dishonest, emotionally abusive, any of that stuff — even if I only ever fell for an illusion of her, that foolishly crystallized with a few weeks together - I lost everything that meant the most to me in this town. I am so hurt to no longer be welcome in this community, essentially because of how she feels about me.

I’ve made friends from this. Had people tell me how she treated me was unfair and fucked up. Said I could do so much better. That the mics aren’t even that good. That she’s a serial dater and has done this time and time again, I was just the first performer to have to go through it.

I took this terribly. I happened to go limerent for like boss level worst case scenario.

She doesn’t care about me. She doesn’t want me around. And I can’t even focus on work right now. I blocked her text and deleted her phone number so I could stop unblocking it. But I keep cycling daydreaming about what I’d say to her if she ever reached out to me on Instagram.

Constant iterations of trying to say it would be best if we went our separate ways knowing deep down inside all I want is to hug her and cuddle with her and talk it out and be understood, with no sex or romance or dating or I guess even friendship necessary. I just feel like an alien banished from her planet, but this analogy has had real world repercussions.

Asking my LO out and my actions after ruined my place in the local community, lost me the presence and respect of the woman I admired the most, led to my presence around her making her feel physically sick and walking out, and I struggle every day for much of the day and want to move out of my hometown.

Worst LO experience ever? Of course not. But for me, this is one of the worst years of my life.",4,1763579898.0,limerence,5,1.0,False

1p1gya3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1p1gya3/should_you_drink_a_lot_of_water_during_your_fast/,Should you drink a lot of water during your fast?,"About to finish my first 72 hour water fast! 🥳🥳

But I am curious if I did this correctly for the next time. I used chat GPT and it only recommended me to drink about 30 ounces of water per day. I was also using electrolytes and drank black coffee. My friend who fasts more often says you should drink 100-120 ounces of water when fasting.

So I’m wondering which is correct? More or less water while doing a 72 hour fast.

""After 999 betrayals, I become their karma""","For three days, I was in the hospital. For three days, my phone didn't make a sound. Not a single call from my family. And I didn't reach out, either. For the first time, I didn't find myself endlessly scrolling through their social media feeds, trying to piece together their lives from a distance.

　　I just rested. I’d lie in my hospital bed, or I’d drag my aching body down the hall for another test or to settle another bill.

　　Even on my discharge day, I didn't tell anyone. I just packed my few things, gritted my teeth against the throb in my abdomen, and took myself home.

　　The moment I pushed the front door open, the laughter in the living room cut off sharply.

　　Everyone was there. My fiancé, Micah, was sitting right next to Pearl, his arm slung casually over her shoulders. When he saw me, he quickly pulled it back and offered me an awkward smile. ""Soph, you're back? Where did you disappear to these past few days?""

　　My brother, Albi Bennett, let out a derisive snort. ""Where do you think? She just had to skip Pearl's graduation. She can't stand a single day where Vivi is the one in the spotlight.""

　　I didn't say a word. I just started walking toward my room.

　　My silence seemed to throw Albi off. Usually, an accusation like that would have me in tears, desperately pleading my case. But not this time.

　　My mom hurried over, holding a glass of juice. ""Hana, sweetie, we were just so swamped with Vivi's graduation party the other day, we missed your calls. Don't be upset, okay?"" She pressed a glass of cranberry juice into my hand.

　　A dull ache pulsed in my chest, even though I thought I was numb to it.

　　I'm allergic to cranberries. Pearl adores them. Because of that, our house was always stocked with anything cranberry-flavored. No matter how many times I'd mentioned my allergy, no one ever seemed to remember.

　　I handed the glass back to her and took a small step back. ""I'm not mad. I'm just going to my room.""

　　As I turned, a loud crash erupted from the living room.

　　My dad had shot to his feet, slamming his hand on the coffee table. ""What is with that sour face since you walked in?"" he screamed. ""Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink! What more do you want? Looks like we've spoiled you rotten!""

　　My heart twisted so hard it hurt to breathe. Tears welled in my eyes, but I reached out, took the glass from my mom's hand, and drank the entire thing in a few desperate gulps.

　　I set the empty glass down gently and wiped my tears away. I looked my dad squarely in the eye, my voice eerily calm. ""Pearl is the one who likes cranberry juice. I'm allergic to it. But it's fine. I drank it all. May I please go to my room now?""

　　""Hana! Why didn't you say something if you're allergic? Who told you to drink it! You're so stubborn!"" Mom fretted, patting my back nervously.

　　Dad looked momentarily ashamed, but it quickly hardened back into anger. ""You could have just said something! You've always had this unlikable attitude. Nothing like Vivi. She knows how to talk to people properly.""

　　Pearl's sweet voice floated from the couch. ""Dad, please don't talk to Hana like that. You'll upset her."" She sounded so gentle, but the smug triumph in her eyes was unmistakable.

　　Pearl had always used my quiet nature to shine brighter. She lived for these comparisons, only truly satisfied when she saw me crushed beneath her heel.

　　I should have felt hurt. I should have been raging. But all I felt was a hollow, endless numbness. Even this public humiliation couldn't stir a single emotion.

　　""I'm sorry,"" I said, my voice flat. ""It won't happen again.""

　　The moment the words left my mouth, a stunned silence fell over the room. Everyone just stared.

　　My obedience left everyone momentarily stunned. After a heavy pause, my dad was the first to speak, his voice slightly less gruff. ""Good. That's the right attitude. We're family. Everything we do is for your own good.""

　　""I know,"" I replied, the words automatic, a numb smile fixed on my face.

　　Seeing I wasn't going to cause trouble, the tension in the room eased. They turned their attention back to Pearl, and the muted chatter from the living room resumed.

　　I took a quiet breath and moved toward the staircase.

　　But as my foot touched the bottom step, a hand closed around my wrist.

　　Micah had slipped up beside me unnoticed. He leaned in, his voice a low whisper. ""You're really not upset?""

　　That faux-gentle tone made my eyes sting all over again. A wave of bitter hurt rose in my chest, but I could only shake my head, my throat too tight to form words.

　　He looked visibly relieved. ""I knew you'd be understanding. You've never been one to make a scene."" He paused, glancing away uncomfortably. ""Look, there's something I wanted to talk about…""

　　 He avoided my eyes. ""We need to postpone the wedding next week.

　　 I promised your sister a long time ago I'd take her to see the Northern Lights at Aurora Bay after her graduation.

　　 Now that the ceremony's over, she won't stop asking me to keep my word. I thought—why not make it a family trip?

　　 The invitations haven't gone out yet. It's just a date; pushing it back a few weeks doesn't change anything,"" he said, a faint, fond smile touching his lips at the mention of her.

　　My heart froze solid. The tears I'd almost shed moments ago now felt like a pathetic joke.

　　 After 999 times of being cast aside, how could a part of me still hope for anything else?

　　When I didn't respond, Micah grew impatient, running a hand through his hair. ""Come on, Soph. Pearl's never been abroad.

　　 This is a huge deal for her. As her family, we should be there. And you've never seen the Aurora either. Think of it as an early honeymoon.""

　　""Sure,"" I said.

　　He blinked, taken aback. ""What did you say?""

　　I let out a slow, measured breath. ""I said, I agree to cancel the wedding.""

　　""Cancel? Who said anything about canceling? I said postpone. We're not canceling the wedding,"" he corrected, a deep frown forming on his face.

　　I lowered my head. A bitter, hollow smile tugged at my lips. Was there really a difference?

　　 As long as Pearl was around, she would never let this wedding happen. She coveted everything I had.

　　 I'd known this since we were children. It was a fight I could never win.

　　 My family's blind favoritism was her ultimate weapon, and now, my own fiancé had fully joined her ranks.

　　My eyes began to burn, and a familiar, crawling itch spread across my skin. The cranberry juice was finally taking effect.

　　I gave a slight nod and turned to go upstairs. I needed the allergy medication in my room before the reaction got worse.

　　""Are you mad that I'm going to Aurora Bay with Micah?"" Pearl's voice came from behind me, dripping with false innocence.

　　I ignored her and kept walking. This was her classic tactic. Even if I did nothing, a single, well-timed pout from her would rally the entire family to her side.

　　Albi was the first to erupt. ""Hey! Soph! Are you deaf? Vivi is talking to you! First you claim you're not angry, now you're giving everyone the silent treatment. Is that any way to act?""

　　I didn't answer. I was so accustomed to these baseless accusations; my entire life had been filled with them. I had learned to face them with a void of emotion.

　　But just as my foot landed on the second-floor landing, a stinging, sharp impact exploded across my cheek. My head snapped to the side.",1,1763579791.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

The last time I (beginner. We just had our anniversary this month) saw my harp mentor I mentioned events, and we had a whole conversation about that. One of the things she said “you can have the lower rate clients, just don’t charge so low that other harpists in the area will get upset with you.” 

I made a temporary move to my hometown recently and I am … harp mentor-less. I’m pretty sure I’m the only harpist “in my (atm) area” unfortunately. 


Could we come up w:

• Lever harp vs Pedal harp rates

• Top 5 biggest cities in the country rates. 

• Big metro area but not a big city rate, maybe still within the top 10 biggest cities. 

• A “tourist city” rate.

• A small town rate. 

• I am new to the industry so please, enlighten me, do you charge differently if it’s bridal shower/ rehearsal, vs actual ceremony and cocktail hour?

• I’m assuming we do 30min/1hr/90min/ 2hrs?
I’ve heard in an audiobook marking as “0-2hrs”because once you’re there, you’re there! The trouble is getting to the gig. So even if you only charge 90min, they might wanna get a 30min lesson from you or something like that if you list “2hrs” but play for less. (I heard this in Ari Herstand’s book)

• Do we charge different by venue? Country Club vs event venue vs art venue vs club/bar/lounge vs performing at someone’s house vs coffee shop?

• Do we charge for mileage? Lodging? Do we add that to our rate? 

• Dumb question: if it’s an event that maybe requires a certain wardrobe, do we do add that? Or are we responsible for getting our gowns on our own?

• If we don’t own amp equipment etc then we are renting and we add that total on?

• How much more if we are singing?

• I’m assuming if we’re in a band we divide equally….

• If we are being televised or on camera— different rate?

• Discount or free for charity event or does it depend?

• Anything we should always say NO to?

• Anything that would be bad etiquette to agree to?

• Anything else I didn’t think of?

I was seeing someone in a more casual dynamic in the last few months. To give some context I am 26 year old female and he is 54. We have been going out to coffee dates and have been intimate. I have been trying to move states so I know this current relationship is not something we have agreed to make extremely serious.  I have asked questions about his previous relationships and other things. He gets really defensive and angry when I ask anything. I have heard from him he has this female friend who he babysits her child and he has admitted to helping her buy a car. I have noticed he has been a lot less engaged with texting and our dates are much shorter. I also have noticed he has been extremely mad when I ask if he is seeing anyone else. 

    I have communicated that it is ok to see others as long as we use protection and the person is tested etc. I honestly do not mind if it's another causal dynamic as long as they are being safe sexually. I feel concerned I'm in a home wrecking situation. I feel like he maybe in a serious relationship or engaged or something. Am I being paranoid or do you sense that I could be onto something. I feel like it is crazy to hook up with someone who gets so angry when you are just making sure you are all being safe. ",0,1763579299.0,AskMenAdvice,13,0.5,False

(Yes I know, it's a no-name china grinder, but they are the very factory that actually produces many of the recent 64mm grinders that popped onto the market in recent years under various names. This one is their latest iteration and is basically an upgraded DF64)

I usually drink one filter (Origami dripper with Kalita wave filter) in the morning and then two or three espresso (Lelit Bianca) during the day. Milk drinks only when guests ask for it.

In both Espresso and Filter I value clarity, sweetness and floral notes. Mostly African beans, both washed and naturals.

Filter is where I really work on the flavour profiles: I do buy stupid expensive filter roast and if I manage to extract a brew in the morning that accentuates e.g. a specific jasmin or strawberry note that I was going after, the day is saved!

I also love espresso and cannot for the life of me drink a nutty / full bodied extraction, but I'm less of a nerd when it comes to working on specific flavour profiles. I just want solid modern espresso, that lets me appreciate different roast / beans. on the Bianca I can do pressure profiling, but if guests are over and I need to bang out ten ""classic"" espressi or some flat-whites, that should be possible without having to pressure-surf each extraction.

What SSP burrs should I order to suit my style? I am torn between the MP Red Speed and the Lab Sweet V3 Red speed:

* I'm reading the MPs can be overly harsh and not so sweet - but more consistent and easier to dial in, especially when switching brew methods / beans.
* Im reading Lab Sweet V3 can be a pain to dail in and almost can't grind fine enought for a espresso (unless you pressure-surf or turbo-shot), but offer more balance and sweetness if you find the perfect setting.

39F here, i have been having supraventricular tachycardia since 2023, and started having extrasystoles in 2022 in my 4th pregnancy.

I have had a 48h holter test done and am followed by my gp. He asked me the usual questions, i answered, but couldn't tell me what causes them and how to make them stop for good. He also told me that cardiovascular exercice won't do anything for it.

I drink decaf coffee, i don't do alcoohol or drugs. I take ADEK, B, and cod liver oil, magnesium, potassium, sodium supplement, low carb diet. I have 4 kids and a adhd husband so stress, too much to handle alone, and bad sleep is what's the hardest on me for the moment. I am putting up strategies to deal better with stressors. Beside that, i go to tai chi lessons (which i will stop soon) to replace it with yoga, and am doing dumbbell lifting 3 times a week for 1 year and half. I will schedule going to the pool once a week for the cardio and see if it helps.

Did any of you had supraventricular tachycardia and succesfully managed to rule it ?

I do tons of sketches on Note when I’m out (bus, coffee shop, whatever). It’s my favorite tool for ideas, and I love how I can finish those sketches later in Ableton Live using my Push 3 (controller).

My workflow is basically: lay down something quick → then spend a long time editing/sculpting MIDI notes. That part is super important to me.

Now I’m thinking about an upgrade during the sale:

◾ Ableton Move

Curious if it would speed up my idea-making or inspire new workflows. But I keep hearing that editing notes on Move isn’t as detailed as on Note. True?

◾ Push 3 Standalone Upgrade

Practical and powerful. Just turn my Push into a portable Live box. But maybe it won’t really change how I create — just where.

⸻

So what would you choose?

Move for new creative workflows, or the Push standalone kit for a more complete version of what I already do?

Would love to hear from people who’ve actually tried Move or standalone Push! 🙌

1p1gm30,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1p1gm30/costa_rica_how_costa_rica_protects_both_people/,Costa Rica - How Costa Rica Protects Both People and Planet (#solutionsbycountry series),"Costa Rica is one of the clearest real-world examples of a country choosing to put environmental health, social well-being, and long-term sustainability at the center of national policy. While no country is perfect, Costa Rica consistently ranks among the world’s leaders in biodiversity protection, renewable energy, democratic stability, and public health. Much of this comes from deliberate choices made over decades. 

Below is a breakdown of the major ways Costa Rica protects its environment and its people, along with the key drivers behind this “people-and-planet-first” national approach.


1. Protecting more than a quarter of the entire country as national parks

Costa Rica has set aside over 25% of its land as protected areas as national parks, biological reserves, wildlife refuges, and forest preserves. This is one of the highest proportions on Earth. These protections safeguard rainforests, cloud forests, mangroves, wetlands, and coral reefs, enabling biodiversity recovery while supporting nature-based tourism.

2. Restoring forests through payment-for-ecosystem-services programs

In the 1980s, Costa Rica had one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. Today, it has doubled its forest cover thanks to the “Pago por Servicios Ambientales” (PSA) program, which pays landowners to conserve, reforest, or sustainably manage land. Farmers, communities, and indigenous groups receive compensation for storing carbon, protecting watersheds, and preserving wildlife habitat.

3. Running the electricity grid largely on renewable energy

Costa Rica has operated on 98–100% renewable electricity for most years over the past decade, relying on hydroelectric power, geothermal energy from volcanoes, wind, and solar. This drastically reduces air pollution, lowers dependency on fossil fuels, and keeps energy prices stable.

4. Eliminating the military to redirect funds toward health and education

In 1948, Costa Rica abolished its military, permanently reallocating that budget to universal education, healthcare, and environmental protection. This unique decision strengthened democratic institutions and contributed to some of the highest human-development indicators in Latin America.

5. Prioritizing universal healthcare and preventive public health systems

Costa Rica’s public health system (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social) emphasizes prevention, primary care, community clinics, vaccination programs, and equitable access. This, along with lower pollution levels, has produced long life expectancy, low maternal mortality, and strong population health.

6. Strengthening indigenous land rights and community stewardship

Indigenous territories (which overlap with some of the most biodiverse regions) have legal recognition, allowing communities to manage forests according to traditional knowledge. Community-led conservation has contributed to successful forest recovery and watershed protection.

7. Building a strong ecotourism economy that rewards conservation

Ecotourism is a major part of Costa Rica’s economy - and because visitors come for pristine ecosystems, the country has strong incentives to maintain parks, protect wildlife, and ensure clean rivers and coastlines. Park fees, guided tours, and community lodges all support local jobs tied directly to healthy ecosystems.

8. Investing heavily in environmental education

Costa Rica integrates ecology, biodiversity, and sustainability into early education. Children learn about watersheds, forests, wildlife, and conservation through hands-on field trips and community projects, helping build an environmentally literate generation.

9. Mitigating climate risk through robust disaster preparedness

Because of its geography, Costa Rica invests in strong early-warning systems, community preparedness, watershed conservation, and climate adaptation strategies. Healthy forests, wetlands, and mangroves help buffer floods and storms, protecting people and infrastructure.

10. Promoting regenerative agriculture and sustainable farming

Costa Rica supports agroforestry systems, shade-grown coffee, reduced pesticide use (with plans to transition away from some chemicals), and soil conservation programs. Farmers who use sustainable practices can access eco-certifications and receive technical assistance.

11. Expanding wildlife corridors to allow species to move safely

The country has created biological corridors that connect fragmented ecosystems, enabling jaguars, tapirs, monkeys, birds, and thousands of other species to migrate and maintain genetic diversity. This strategy supports long-term biodiversity resilience.


Key Drivers Behind Costa Rica’s People-and-Planet-First Approach 🌼 

1. A cultural identity rooted in peace, nature, and democracy

Costa Rica’s national ethos is “pura vida”. It emphasizes simplicity, community, and nature. The country’s long democratic tradition and lack of a military contribute to a culture that values environmental protection over aggressive development.

2. Stable democratic institutions and long-term planning

Environmental laws, social programs, and land protections span multiple administrations, creating policy stability. Long-term planning ensures that investments in health, forests, and water systems persist across political cycles.

3. Seeing environmental protection as an economic strategy, not a cost

Costa Rica treats nature as something that generates revenue, regulates water, stores carbon, attracts tourism, and stabilizes climate. This framing has been key to making conservation politically and economically sustainable.

4. Strong collaboration among government, communities, NGOs, and scientists

Costa Rica is known for cooperative governance. Conservation policies are often developed with input from researchers, landowners, indigenous communities, and environmental NGOs, creating broader support for implementation.",2,1763579107.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False

This is when during my travel (30 Oct to 12 Nov) most of these properties were costing $125-250 or higher, specially in Tokyo or more Touristy places.

Would you believe I booked weekend in Tokyo Bay for 8k points or Osaka/Kyoto for 10k directly near Namba/Kyoto Station ?  
Or that I was able to book Hotel ""Around"" Takayama (Ascent Collection) for just 8k points aswell ?

Well I was, and to put cherry on the cake, Choice was having a 40% bonus sale to buy points through which I paid around $0.0073/point to buy some 80k points, so total of $590\~  

In short, I paid in cash $59\~ for each of those 8k point hotels, otherwise retailing for minimum of $100 and around $200 for most of the time in Tokyo.

Stayed Choice Tokyo Bay Suites, Roppongi, Around Takayama, Kanayama Nagoya and Shinshaibashi Osaka.  

I actually liked all of the hotels a lot despite the typical japanese room size, one big reason for this was their ""Library Cafe"" where you could sit and work/read in a much more open and larger community space and enjoy free coffee.

It took away 3 years of Dev time to implement this Fedex courier simulator skill in the game. I'm not taking a shot at the Devs here as it probably took a ton of engine work to even make this happen. But here we are with a skill that's slower than F2p Runecrafting in early levels and has very shallow depth going forward at least for now. You start as a Fedex courier shipping out boxes and as you progress you can just take on more shipments at the time. The Baracuda trials are the only decent xp in game and it makes the skill a bit better gameplay wise, but it feels like running an agility lap just with a timer on it. The bounties provide some variety to the skill, but is absolutely dogshit xp wise and therefore not really worth doing at least for now. Same with salvaging shipwrecks. One would think ''Oh great finally I can afk the skill'' but no not really. You can maybe sip a cup of coffee and you're already done salvaging and off you go to find a next ship wreck. 

  
Overall the skill is a massive waste of Dev time in my honest opinion and will just be yet another grind you do, just to access the cool areas that will be locked behind it in the future. But to end on a more positive note, I do believe the skill has potential down the line with future updates to really enhance the skill like boat vs boat pvp and boat combat against maybe bosses, but that's not something we can probably hope for in anytime soon.

1p1gjr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1p1gjr3/10mg_of_ritalin_hits_hard/,10mg of Ritalin hits hard,"I've been prescribed Ritalin this week to test out if it helps with my concentration and calming down my mind.

I started out last Monday on 5mg, and was actually quite pleased with it. I felt a lot more calm, better engaged in conversations (less daydreaming while people are talking to me), I can scan my surroundings better and my task initiation was much better. Yesterday I felt like this medication makes me able-minded again, which was quite an emotional impression if it keeps working like this

However, taking it at 9am also meant that around 1 to 2pm this effect was sadly gone.

Today I took a second 5mg dose at 1pm or so, and it hit way harder than I expected. I expected a prolongation of the first 5mg dose, but instead, I was experiencing a higher heartbeat (around 105bpm over my regular 70-80bpm while working). Also a bit more irritable I guess, even though my focus and ability to process stimuli was still very good. Now its 9pm and I feel like I'm still laser focused.

I will keep an eye out for the higher heartbeat, not too overly concerned about it yet (I switched to tea for my meals where I took Ritalin, but I can skip other coffee breaks too I guess).

However, I do wonder if people recognize this almost non-linear progression of dosing? I'm almost wondering whether I will do better on multiple 2.5mg doses instead.",3,1763578967.0,ADHD,2,0.8,False

1p1ghc4,https://i.redd.it/afotk3xah92g1.jpeg,Just found out I was prediabetic,"Just like the title says! And the crazy thing is, that test was done back in May, but I never got a call or a ping to say “hey…prediabetes…”. I only found out today when one of my providers was talking about some lab results and I heard her say “in the prediabetes range” and I had to walk it back. I mean it was so slight and subtle you’d think it wasn’t a big deal. And i’ve been living like shit that whole time, God only knows where it is now, I’m waiting for the results as I got another test in today.

I guess the point of this post is to hear some thoughts and experiences about what I’ll be outlining here soon.

I’m a disordered eater not in the way that I overeat but I forget to eat at all and sometimes just fill up on junk. I don’t have a food routine, don’t watch my nutrients none of that. I’m not a heavy soda drinker, don’t do any treat-like coffees but my weakness is “a sweet treat”. 

I wanna get into a routine as soon as possible but not in a headspace to do anything drastic or far-reaching so here is what I’m thinking of doing:

I recognize low carb and low sugars are going to be key here. I’m thinking just find a healthy meal for all three meals, breakfast lunch & dinner and just sticking to it until I can get my head on straight

Breakfast: egg, tomato, spinach muffins, avocado and maybe a slice of whole wheat bread with plain greek yogurt topped with chia seeds.

Lunch: some kind of meat whether that’s fish, chicken or red meat with vegetables like broccoli or asparagus and some quinoa

Dinner: salad with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado and diced up chicken cutlets

What do you guys think? Or has anyone done this? I’m not good with doing new recipes often so that’s where my “one thing everyday” tactic is from. Thank yall in advance",2,1763578827.0,prediabetes,4,1.0,False

I'm particularly interested in advice from women who have been divorced and back out in the dating world. Though I appreciate any perspectives as long as they are kind and well meaning. Thanks!



A few months back, I met a woman my age (or older) in a Starbucks. Her beauty blew me away and changed the definition of word. It was like a beacon of light shone upon her and a voice whispered, ""There she is."" I've never been so struck before. (And, no this isn't lust, I have felt that in my long life and know the difference.)

I built up some courage and started a conversation with her. The conversation flowed naturally and was very easy. We ran into each other a few more times, and I asked if she wanted to have coffee. She said yes and told me I am, ""easy on the eyes."" But she also mentioned she had a boyfriend. We still exchanged numbers. We have texted a little bit since, but haven't seen each other since.

I don't obsess, but she enters my thoughts daily. I really want to get to know her better and see if there is anything there. I feel that life is too short to not tell her some of what is going through my mind. I also don't want to come across as disrespectful or creepy.

So how would you feel if you received a text from a man telling you how much you touched him and that he would like to get to know you better if things ever align?",0,1763578744.0,datingoverforty,12,0.2,False

Trouble is, a bad VPN pick can leave you with snail-slow speeds, no access to your favorite platforms, or a provider quietly logging your data.

My team and I did the hard work for you, testing 50+ VPNs on laptops, phones, smart TVs, and routers. We ran speed tests, checked platform accessibility, and dug through privacy policies. I also paid attention to ease of use and how many devices you can connect at once.

Only a few made the cut and are the kind you can trust for e-banking on public WiFi. Leading them is ExpressVPN, for its excellent speeds, strong security, and airtight privacy. With its 30*-day money-back guarantee, you can try it risk-free before committing. Editor’s Note: Transparency is one of our core values at WizCase, so you should know we are in the same ownership group as ExpressVPN.

The biggest problem we had prior to this was my shower being broken for 6 months. The temperature knob did not work, and the “hottest” setting was the only water that came out. Meaning that if the water heater was turned up all the way, it would be scalding.

After many conversations, my landlord  would switch the water heater all the at up because she “preferred” a hot shower instead of keeping it in the warmer side so that it was still functional for me before it got fixed. Finally got fixed in October.

Throughout that ordeal, things remained civil and she eventually apologized for how she handled everything. I continued to pay on time and keep things friendly, though I let her know this was a source of resentment and she needs to do better with future tenants.

I let her know a month ago that I would be moving out and she reacted well. No other drama and I was out of town all last week.

Would there be a difference in taste?

Essentially, I’d like to know whether I can tweak the flavour of my coffee using only variable, and holding the others constant (eg grind size), or is there a point at which I must change my water temperature to enhance the proportion of acidic/sweet/bitter compounds.",0,1763578436.0,AeroPress,0,0.5,False
1p1ga7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1p1ga7v/husband_wants_me_to_be_close_to_his_family_but/,Husband wants me to be close to his family but they make no efforts,"Salam alaikum,

I’’m just exhausted to have to explain this over and over to my husband but he just doesn’t get it. The way he embraced my family and how my family embraced and welcomed him, the way all my family makes time for to meet him, to host and cook for him, the time we all spend together.. his family does none of that. 

He will come sit at my parents house, everyone will make themselves available and come sit with him, talk, serve tea and catch up.

On the other hand, I have to add that I only met his brothers THREE months after our wedding and that it was very casual and nonchalant. They didn’t even come to see me it was all coincidence. I didn’t even want to see them cause I felt so insulted that there was no acknowledgment of my presence / existence by them, and only came out my bedroom for my husbands sake. Said salam, offered tea / coffee and chat with them. They didn’t know ANYTHING about me, my current situation, where I live??? I was so shocked. 

My husband has been asking each member of his family to have a family dinner since there was no proper introduction of me to them and to finally all sit down together. No efforts was made by anyone. Not even the mother. Dinner never happened. 

I think seeing me in my family made him maybe “envious” and he expects me to behave the same way, but honestly how to be warm and so welcoming to people that don’t even care to meet me, congratulate me for my marriage, or his parents don’t even call or text, they only speak to him even when it’s about me. They don’t even have dinners together, they’re quite individual and independent. I can’t just come and change them? I can’t make up for the fact that they are how they are. I behave the same way they behave with me. 

He makes it look like he’s doing so much for my family when we go visit them BUT : my brother picks us up from the station, we arrive and everyone’s is there ready to welcome us, there’s food, other relatives (uncle and autines) also make them and come see us. If we decide to stay overnight, they prepare a room with fresh bedsheet and toiletries. He just sits in the couch and has literally nothing else to do. 

I have yet to see any kind of effort from his family. I make efforts for my husbands sake to honour their invitation and make sure to come with flowers, chocolate cause they like it. Sometimes I even cook things they like from my cuisine. 

He always criticise me and says I make no effort, and in the space of 6 months of marriage, we had many arguments about this. 

How to make him understand that our families are DIFFERENT and that his relationship either my family will never be the same or compare to mine with his. Me and his family will never be close.

As a scientist who's spent years studying this stuff (and also spent years personally battling with belly fat like we were in a Marvel movie), I'm here to give you the real deal on **how to lose belly fat** with jokes that'll make you laugh so hard you'll burn calories just reading this article. No cap!

# The Science of Belly Fat: Why Your Stomach Looks Like It's Storing Supplies for Winter

Alright, let's get real for a second. That belly fat sitting around your midsection like it's paying rent? Yeah, that's actually doing way more than just making your jeans feel tighter than a pair of skinny jeans at Thanksgiving dinner. **Visceral adipose tissue** (that's the scientific name for the belly fat that's deep inside, hugging your organs like an overly attached ex) is actually an active endocrine organ that's out here secreting hormones and inflammatory molecules like it's running a whole chemistry lab in your abdomen.

Research from the [Frontiers in Physiology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6906176/) shows that men have a higher tendency to accumulate abdominal visceral fat compared to pre-menopausal women, which explains why your uncle's belly enters the room three seconds before he does. And before you blame it all on beer (the classic ""beer belly"" excuse), studies actually show that beer doesn't specifically target your belly – it just makes you gain weight overall. So that ""beer belly"" is really just an ""I-ate-everything-belly"" in disguise!

The [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat) research team found that people with the highest levels of abdominal fat in their 40s were nearly THREE TIMES more likely to develop dementia later in life. Y'all, your belly fat is literally out here trying to make you forget where you put your keys! That's wild!

# Why Belly Fat Is the Villain in Your Health Story

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Doc, why you gotta call my belly fat a villain?"" Because, my friend, this particular type of fat is literally plotting against you! According to research published in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42398-1), **visceral fat** is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and even certain cancers. Your belly fat is basically that friend who says they're supportive but is secretly sabotaging your whole life!

Here's what's happening: That visceral fat is releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) while simultaneously REDUCING the good stuff like adiponectin. It's like having a bad roommate who eats all your food, doesn't pay rent, AND invites their loud friends over at 2 AM. Unacceptable!

# The Best Belly Fat Exercises: Time to Get Moving (But Make It Fun)

Okay, now we're getting to the good stuff – the **best belly fat exercises** that'll actually work! But first, let me tell you something that's gonna sound crazy: you can't spot-reduce belly fat by just doing crunches. I know, I know – I was shocked too! It's like finding out Santa isn't real, but for adults who thought 1000 **sit ups** would give them abs.

# Belly Fat Cardio Workouts: Sweat Like You're Running From Your Problems

**Belly fat cardio workouts** are essential because they create that calorie deficit we need. And trust me, when I say cardio, I don't just mean running on a **treadmill** looking like you're being chased by invisible demons. There are so many options!

**Belly fat HIIT workouts** (High-Intensity Interval Training) are where it's at! Studies show that HIIT is incredibly effective for reducing visceral adipose tissue. You basically go hard for short bursts, then rest, then go hard again – like when you're trying to catch the elevator before the doors close, rest while riding up, then sprint again because you forgot something downstairs. That's HIIT, baby!

Here are some killer options:

* [Belly fat treadmill workouts](https://amzn.to/3X5wP1v): Sprint intervals (30 seconds fast, 90 seconds recovery)
* [Belly fat cycling workouts](https://amzn.to/4r4ii41): Whether outdoors or on a stationary bike, cycling burns serious calories
* [Belly fat swimming workouts](https://amzn.to/3LM072N): Low-impact but high-calorie burn – your joints will thank you
* [Belly fat running plan](https://amzn.to/4pbYKbW): Start with a couch-to-5K program if you're new
* [Belly fat walking plan](https://amzn.to/485rCvw): Don't sleep on walking! A brisk 30-minute walk daily works wonders
* [Belly fat jump rope](https://amzn.to/4rgtb2P): Burns more calories per minute than almost any other exercise. Just... maybe warn your downstairs neighbors first

# Belly Fat Strength Training: Build Muscle, Burn Fat, Look Amazing

Now let's talk **belly fat strength training** because this is where the magic happens! When you build muscle through **belly fat resistance training**, you're increasing your metabolic rate even when you're just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. Your muscles are basically burning calories 24/7 like tiny furnaces in your body. I call them my ""personal finance advisors"" because they're constantly helping me spend (burn) calories!

**Best belly fat strength workouts:**

**Belly fat dumbbell workouts**: Grab some weights and do compound movements like:

* **Belly fat squats**: Works your largest muscle groups (plus your legs will look amazing in shorts)
* **Belly fat lunges**: Great for legs, glutes, and core stability
* **Dumbbell thrusters**: A squat-to-press movement that's basically a full-body workout disguised as one exercise

**Belly fat resistance bands**: Perfect for home workouts! These bad boys provide constant tension and are easier on your joints than heavy weights. Plus, they're portable – you can take them anywhere, like that one friend who always needs a ride.

[Belly fat gym machines](https://amzn.to/4pbYKbW): If you're at the gym, don't ignore the machines:

* Cable machines for **core exercises**
* Leg press for building lower body strength
* Lat pulldown for upper body and core engagement

**Belly fat gym routines** should include full-body compound movements 3-4 times per week. Focus on exercises that engage multiple muscle groups because trying to work just your abs is like trying to eat just one chip – ineffective and frustrating!

# Belly Fat Core Exercises: The Foundation of a Strong Core

Listen, **belly fat core exercises** are important, but not for the reason you think! They won't magically melt the fat off your stomach (if only it were that easy – I'd be doing crunches while reading this to you!), but they WILL strengthen the muscles underneath, improve your posture, and help with overall functional fitness.

**Best core exercises:**

* **Belly fat plank variations**: Standard plank, side plank, plank with shoulder taps (my personal favorite because it makes me feel like I'm patting myself on the back for working out)
* **Belly fat mountain climbers**: Cardio + core = chef's kiss
* **Belly fat burpees**: The exercise everyone loves to hate but secretly respects
* **Belly fat crunches**: Classic, but do them properly!
* **Belly fat push ups**: Works chest, arms, AND core

# Belly Fat Yoga Poses and Pilates: The Gentle Giants

Don't underestimate **belly fat yoga poses** and **belly fat pilates exercises**! These aren't just for flexible people who can turn themselves into human pretzels. Yoga and Pilates both strengthen your core, improve flexibility, reduce stress (which we'll talk about later because stress and belly fat are besties), and help with overall body awareness.

**Effective yoga poses:**

* Boat pose (Navasana)
* Plank pose
* Warrior series
* Chair pose

**Belly fat pilates exercises** focus on controlled movements that really engage your deep core muscles. It's like regular exercise but fancier, with better posture!

# Belly Fat Home Workouts vs. Gym Routines: Choose Your Fighter

Real talk: **belly fat home workouts** can be just as effective as gym workouts if you do them right! You don't need a fancy gym membership to see results. All you need is:

* Your body weight
* Maybe some **resistance bands**
* Possibly some [dumbbells](https://amzn.to/43EPFQV)
* A good **belly fat workout plan**
* And the determination of someone trying to get the last slice of pizza

**Belly fat exercise equipment** you might want:

* Resistance bands (cheap and versatile)
* Dumbbells (start with 10-20 lbs depending on your fitness level)
* A yoga mat (so you're not planking on the floor like you're doing penance)
* **Jump rope** (remember, it's one of the best calorie burners!)
* **Belly fat workout videos** for guidance (YouTube is your friend here)

There are also tons of **belly fat fitness apps** that can track your progress, provide workouts, and keep you accountable. It's like having a personal trainer in your pocket, except this one doesn't judge you for eating ice cream at midnight!

# Belly Fat Burning Foods: Eat Your Way to a Slimmer Waist

Now we're getting to my favorite part – FOOD! Because let me tell you, **belly fat burning foods** exist, and they're actually delicious. You don't have to eat cardboard and sadness to lose belly fat!

# Belly Fat Protein Foods: Your New Best Friends

**Belly fat protein foods** are crucial because protein helps you feel full longer, preserves muscle mass during weight loss, and has a high thermic effect (meaning your body burns more calories digesting protein than it does digesting carbs or fat). It's like getting a discount on calories – you eat them, but you spend extra energy processing them!

**Best protein sources:**

* Lean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef)
* Fish (especially fatty fish like salmon – full of omega-3s)
* Eggs (the whole egg, not just egg whites – the yolk has nutrients!)
* Greek yogurt
* Legumes and beans
* Tofu and tempeh for my plant-based friends

# Belly Fat Fiber Foods: Keep Things Moving

**Belly fat fiber foods** are essential because fiber helps with digestion, keeps you full, and can help reduce belly fat accumulation. Plus, fiber is like the bouncer at the club of your digestive system – it keeps things moving smoothly and doesn't let the bad stuff hang around too long!

**High-fiber champions:**

* Oats (not the sugar-loaded instant kind, though)
* Vegetables (especially leafy greens and cruciferous veggies)
* Fruits (berries are particularly good)
* Whole grains
* Chia seeds and flaxseeds

# Belly Fat Superfoods: The Avengers of Nutrition

**Belly fat superfoods** sound fancy, but they're really just nutrient-dense foods that give you the most bang for your buck:

* **Belly fat green tea**: Contains catechins that may help boost metabolism. Plus, it makes you feel sophisticated!
* **Belly fat apple cider vinegar**: May help with blood sugar control. Just dilute it, please – drinking it straight is like voluntarily choosing violence against your esophagus
* Avocados (healthy fats that keep you satisfied)
* Nuts and seeds (in moderation – they're calorie-dense but nutritious)
* Berries (low in calories, high in antioxidants)
* Leafy greens (you can eat mountains of these for very few calories)

# Belly Fat Detox Drinks and Metabolism Boosters

Okay, let's talk about **belly fat detox drinks** and **belly fat metabolism boosters** for a second. First, your liver and kidneys already do a pretty good job of ""detoxing"" your body – they're like the cleanup crew that works 24/7 without complaining. But some drinks can support your weight loss efforts:

* **Belly fat lemon water**: Hydrating and may help with digestion. It's basically fancy water that makes you feel like you have your life together
* **Belly fat smoothies**: Great for getting nutrients in, but watch the calories! Don't turn your smoothie into a 1000-calorie dessert disguised as health food
* Green tea (mentioned earlier, but it deserves a second shoutout)
* Black coffee (zero calories and gives you that ""I can conquer the world"" energy)

**Belly fat hydration tips**: Drink water like it's your job! Sometimes your body confuses thirst with hunger. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day, more if you're working out. Your body is basically a houseplant with complex emotions – water it regularly!

# Belly Fat Diet Plans That Actually Work

Let me break down some popular **belly fat diet plans** without all the marketing BS:

# Belly Fat Low Carb Diet and Keto

The **belly fat low carb diet** and **belly fat keto diet** work for many people because they reduce insulin levels and make your body burn fat for fuel. But here's the thing – they're not magical! They work primarily because you're eating fewer calories overall. Keto is basically eating like a fancy caveman who discovered cheese.

**Pros:**

* Can lead to rapid initial weight loss
* Reduces appetite for many people
* May improve insulin sensitivity

**Cons:**

* Can be restrictive and hard to maintain
* Initial ""keto flu"" feels like you got hit by a truck
* Not necessary for everyone to lose belly fat

# Belly Fat Intermittent Fasting

**Belly fat intermittent fasting** is basically just scheduling when you eat, not what you eat (though what you eat still matters, obviously). Popular methods include:

* 16:8 (fast for 16 hours, eat in an 8-hour window)
* 5:2 (eat normally 5 days, restrict calories 2 days)
* OMAD (One Meal A Day – for the truly ambitious)

It works because it naturally creates a **belly fat calorie deficit** and may have some metabolic benefits. Plus, you save time not thinking about breakfast!

# Belly Fat Portion Control: The Unsexy Truth

Look, **belly fat portion control** isn't glamorous or Instagram-worthy, but it WORKS. You can eat healthy foods and still gain weight if you're eating too much. It's like putting premium gas in your car but overfilling the tank – just because it's good doesn't mean you need MORE of it!

**Tips for portion control:**

* Use smaller plates (trick your brain into thinking you're eating more)
* Measure your food initially (just to see what portions actually look like)
* Eat slowly and mindfully (put your phone down!)
* Start meals with vegetables (fill up on the low-calorie stuff first)

# Belly Fat Meal Prep: Work Smarter, Not Harder

**Belly fat meal prep** is a game-changer! Spend a few hours on Sunday preparing meals for the week, and you won't be tempted to order takeout when you're tired and hungry. It's like future you giving present you a gift!

**Meal prep basics:**

* Cook proteins in bulk (grill chicken, bake fish, etc.)
* Prep vegetables (chop, roast, steam)
* Cook whole grains (brown rice, quinoa)
* Portion everything into containers

**Belly fat healthy recipes** and **belly fat meal ideas** should include:

* Lean protein
* Complex carbs
* Healthy fats
* Lots of vegetables

**Belly fat cooking tips:**

* Roast instead of fry
* Use herbs and spices instead of excessive salt or sugar
* Steam or grill vegetables
* Make sauces yourself (bottled ones often have hidden sugars)

# Belly Fat Healthy Snacks: Because We All Get Hangry

**Belly fat healthy snacks** are crucial for avoiding that 3 PM vending machine raid:

* Greek yogurt with berries
* Apple slices with almond butter
* Veggies with hummus
* Hard-boiled eggs
* A small handful of nuts
* Protein shake

# Belly Fat Shopping Guide and Grocery List

When you hit the store, your **belly fat grocery list** should focus on whole, unprocessed foods:

**Proteins:**

* Chicken breast
* Salmon
* Lean ground turkey
* Eggs
* Greek yogurt

**Vegetables:**

* Spinach and kale
* Broccoli and cauliflower
* Bell peppers
* Zucchini
* Sweet potatoes

**Fruits:**

* Berries (all kinds!)
* Apples
* Bananas (yes, even though they have sugar – they're still fruit!)
* Citrus fruits

**Pantry Staples:**

* Quinoa and brown rice
* Oats
* Olive oil
* Nuts and seeds
* Spices and herbs

**Belly fat food swaps** to make your life easier:

* Swap white rice → brown rice or cauliflower rice
* Swap regular pasta → whole wheat or chickpea pasta
* Swap sugary cereal → oatmeal with berries
* Swap chips → air-popped popcorn or veggie sticks
* Swap soda → sparkling water with lemon

# The Hidden Factors: Sleep, Stress, and Hormones

Okay, so we've covered exercise and diet, but there's more to the story! Your **belly fat hormones balance** plays a HUGE role in fat storage.

# Belly Fat Sleep Hacks: Zzz Your Way to a Flatter Stomach

**Belly fat sleep hacks** are underrated! Studies show that people who don't get enough sleep have higher levels of ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and lower levels of leptin (the satiety hormone). Basically, when you're tired, your body is like ""FEED ME EVERYTHING"" even though you don't actually need more food.

**Tips for better sleep:**

* Aim for 7-9 hours per night
* Keep your bedroom cool and dark
* Avoid screens for an hour before bed
* Establish a consistent sleep schedule
* Don't drink caffeine after 2 PM (yes, that includes that afternoon coffee)

# Belly Fat Stress Reduction: Calm Down for a Flatter Belly

**Belly fat stress reduction** is critical because stress increases cortisol, and cortisol loves to store fat around your midsection. It's like cortisol looked at all the places it could store fat and said, ""You know what? The belly is prime real estate!""

**Belly fat cortisol management** strategies:

* Practice meditation or deep breathing
* Exercise regularly (but don't overtrain – that's stressful too!)
* Spend time with friends and family
* Take breaks during work
* Do activities you enjoy
* Consider therapy or counseling if stress is overwhelming

# Belly Fat Insulin Resistance and Blood Sugar Control

**Belly fat insulin resistance** is when your cells stop responding properly to insulin, leading to higher blood sugar levels and more fat storage. It's like your cells are ignoring insulin's text messages!

**Belly fat sugar detox** doesn't mean you can never eat sugar again (thank goodness), but reducing added sugars can help:

* Read labels (sugar hides under 50+ different names!)
* Limit sugary drinks
* Choose whole fruits over fruit juice
* Reduce processed foods
* Focus on complex carbs that don't spike blood sugar

# Belly Fat Alcohol Reduction: Sorry, Party People

**Belly fat alcohol reduction** might be necessary because alcohol is literally empty calories (7 calories per gram, with zero nutrients). Plus, alcohol lowers your inhibitions, which is why drunk you thinks ordering pizza at 2 AM is a brilliant idea!

**Tips:**

* Limit to 1-2 drinks max when you do drink
* Choose lower-calorie options (vodka soda vs. sugary cocktails)
* Have a glass of water between each drink
* Don't drink on an empty stomach
* Consider taking regular breaks from alcohol

# Belly Fat Supplements: Do They Work?

Let's talk about **belly fat fat-burning supplements**, **belly fat protein shakes**, **belly fat vitamins**, **belly fat minerals**, and **belly fat probiotics**. The truth? Most supplements are not magic pills!

**What might actually help:**

* **Protein powder**: Convenient way to hit protein goals
* **Vitamin D**: Many people are deficient, and it affects metabolism
* **Omega-3s**: Anti-inflammatory and good for heart health
* **Probiotics**: Support **belly fat gut health** and **digestion**
* Green tea extract: May provide a small metabolic boost

**What's probably BS:**

* ""Fat burner"" pills with proprietary blends
* Wraps or creams that claim to ""melt"" fat
* Anything that promises results ""without diet or exercise""

**Belly fat digestion tips** and **belly fat gut health** are connected to overall health! A healthy gut microbiome may help with weight management. Eat fermented foods, take probiotics if needed, and eat plenty of fiber to feed the good bacteria.

# Belly Fat Lifestyle Changes: The Long Game

Look, **belly fat lifestyle changes** are the real secret sauce here. You can't out-exercise a bad diet, and you can't diet your way out of a sedentary lifestyle. You need both!

**Belly fat sustainable habits** that'll change your life:

* Move every day (even if it's just a walk)
* Cook most of your meals at home
* Prioritize sleep like it's your job
* Manage stress actively
* Stay hydrated
* Build a support system
* Be patient with yourself

**Belly fat consistency hacks:**

* Schedule workouts like important meetings
* Prep food in advance
* Track your habits (even if you don't track calories)
* Have accountability partners
* Focus on systems, not just goals
* Celebrate small wins

# Belly Fat Progress Tracking: Measure What Matters

**Belly fat progress tracking** is important, but don't become obsessed! Here's what to track:

* Waist circumference (more important than weight!)
* Progress photos (take them monthly in the same spot, same time, same lighting)
* How your clothes fit
* Energy levels
* Strength improvements
* Overall wellbeing

Use **belly fat fitness apps** to help track:

* Workouts
* Food intake (if helpful)
* Steps
* Sleep
* Measurements

# Belly Fat Motivation Tips: Keep Going When It Gets Hard

**Belly fat motivation tips** for when you want to quit:

1. **Remember your why**: Write down why you started
2. **Belly fat motivation quotes**: Find ones that resonate with you
3. **Belly fat success stories**: Read about others who've done it
4. **Belly fat before and after**: Look at transformations (including your own progress!)
5. **Community**: Join online groups or find local workout buddies

**Belly fat transformation plan** should include:

* Clear, specific goals
* A realistic timeline (not ""lose 50 pounds in 2 weeks"")
* Milestones to celebrate along the way
* Flexibility to adjust as needed

**Belly fat 30 day plan** or **belly fat 7 day detox**: These can be good kickstarts, but remember that sustainable change takes longer. **Belly fat quick results** are motivating, but **belly fat long term results** are what we're really after!

# Belly Fat Challenge and Structured Plans

Consider joining a **belly fat fitness challenge** with friends or online! Having others on the same journey helps with accountability and motivation. It's like having workout buddies who'll call you out when you try to skip leg day!

**Belly fat lifestyle hacks** to make everything easier:

* Lay out workout clothes the night before
* Keep healthy snacks visible
* Hide junk food (or better yet, don't buy it)
* Make your environment support your goals
* Use smaller plates and bowls
* Drink water before meals

# The Mind-Body Connection: Self-Care and Confidence

**Belly fat body confidence** starts NOW, not after you lose weight! You deserve to feel good about yourself at every stage of your journey. Your worth isn't determined by your waist size!

**Belly fat self care** includes:

* Treating yourself with kindness
* Celebrating non-scale victories
* Taking rest days
* Doing activities you enjoy
* Surrounding yourself with positive people
* Professional help if needed (therapists, dietitians, trainers)

**Belly fat wellness tips** for overall health:

* Focus on how you feel, not just how you look
* Prioritize mental health
* Stay social and connected
* Find joy in movement
* Eat foods you enjoy (just in appropriate amounts)
* Give yourself grace when you mess up

# Belly Fat Goals: Strong Core, Toned Abs, Healthy Body

At the end of the day, we're working toward a **belly fat strong core**, **belly fat toned abs**, **belly fat flat stomach**, **belly fat slim waist**, and most importantly, a **belly fat healthy body**!

But remember: You can be healthy at different body sizes. The goal is to reduce excess visceral fat for HEALTH reasons, not just aesthetics. Studies from the [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5889055/) show that visceral fat loss significantly improves metabolic health markers even with modest weight loss.

# The Final Word: Your Belly Fat Action Plan

Alright, let's wrap this up! Here's your action plan to **burn belly fat fast** and keep it off:

**Week 1-2: Foundation Building**

* Start tracking what you eat (just to see where you're at)
* Add 30 minutes of walking daily
* Drink more water
* Get 7-8 hours of sleep

**Week 3-4: Ramping Up**

* Add 2-3 strength training sessions
* Start incorporating HIIT workouts
* Begin meal prepping
* Cut out sugary drinks

**Month 2-3: Consistency Phase**

* Maintain workout schedule (4-5 times per week)
* Continue healthy eating habits
* Manage stress actively
* Track progress with measurements and photos

**Month 4+: Lifestyle Integration**

* This is your new normal!
* Continue challenging yourself with new exercises
* Maintain healthy habits
* Enjoy **cheat meals** occasionally (life is for living!)
* Focus on long-term sustainability

Remember: This isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. Actually, it's more like a really long walk with some sprints thrown in and occasional stops for water and maybe a healthy snack. The point is, be patient with yourself!

# Conclusion: You Got This!

Look, losing belly fat isn't easy, but it's definitely doable! Armed with this comprehensive guide covering everything from **belly fat burning foods** to **belly fat HIIT workouts** to **belly fat hormones balance**, you now have all the tools you need.

The key is to start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can. Don't wait for the ""perfect time"" to start – that time is NOW! Your future self with the **strong core** and **flat stomach** is already thanking you!

And hey, if you fall off the wagon (because you will – we all do!), just get back on! It's not about being perfect; it's about being consistent most of the time. Think of it like brushing your teeth – you don't quit brushing your teeth forever just because you forgot one night, right?

So get out there, start moving, eat those **belly fat superfoods**, manage that stress, get your sleep, and remember: your belly fat didn't accumulate overnight, and it won't disappear overnight either. But with the right **belly fat transformation plan** and **belly fat motivation**, you WILL see results!

You're not just burning belly fat – you're building a healthier, stronger, more confident YOU. And that, my friend, is worth way more than a six-pack (though the six-pack is a nice bonus, not gonna lie!).

Now get after it! 💪🔥

1p1g3yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1p1g3yi/how_to_be_hot_and_smart_without_being_cringe_or/,"How to be “hot and smart” without being cringe or try-hard (yes, it’s totally possible)","It’s wild how so many people I know, online and offline, are obsessed with this “hot and smart” combo right now. It’s all over TikTok, Instagram, Reddit. That idea of being effortlessly attractive but also intimidatingly educated. But when people try to do both, it either leans too try-hard—like “look at my obscure book recs and my 10-step skincare routine” or it just feels... fake. I like cosplay.

This post isn’t a flex or a vibe checklist. It’s a researched, non-BS breakdown on how to actually develop real inner depth *and* outer glow, without falling into the trap of seeking validation or mimicking influencer behavior that doesn’t translate into real life.

This is all pulled from actual books, psychology research, and expert interviews. Not “aesthetic” reels by someone trying to go viral. You don't need to be born hot. You don't need to be a genius. The “hot & smart” energy is a skillset, something you build. And it’s totally doable if you approach it less like a performance and more like a mindset + habit shift.

Here’s how to start.

* **Becoming “hot” starts with what people subconsciously *feel* around you, not how you look**
  * *Confidence is the most magnetic version of “hot”*  
    * Psychologist Amy Cuddy’s TED Talk on power posing and presence explains how body language changes how others see us, and how we see ourselves. People rate confident faces as significantly more attractive, regardless of facial symmetry or weight (source: *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2010*).
    * True confidence isn’t loud. It's relaxed eye contact, slower movements, warm but firm tone, and a calm energy. You don’t need to dominate a room. You need to own your space in it.
  
  * *Good posture matters more than makeup or fashion trends*  
    * According to Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer, posture signals vitality, stability, and openness—all attractive markers. Just standing with your shoulders relaxed and chin level makes people think you're physically fitter and more socially dominant.  
    * Instead of obsessing over body size, focus on how you carry it. Pilates, yoga, and Alexander Technique are underrated posture hacks that also reduce anxiety.

  * *Minimal grooming > Overdoing it*  
    * The “clean aesthetic” trend isn’t just hype. Evolutionary psychology research shows that subtle grooming signals high self-regulation and conscientiousness, which are traits associated with long-term desirability (David Buss, *The Evolution of Desire*).
    * Do less, but do it consistently. Glowy skin, clean nails, good breath, a scent that’s not overpowering. It’s not about being “perfect.” It’s about presenting as ""handled.""

* **Being “smart” isn’t about signaling your IQ, it’s about being interesting**
  * *Smart ≠ knowing everything. It means being curious.*  
    * Psychologist Todd Kashdan found that curiosity—not raw intelligence—is one of the biggest drivers of charisma and social magnetism (*APA Psychology Today, 2009*).  
    * Start by reading what YOU find interesting. Not what looks impressive. Even reading Reddit threads deeply is better than fake-reading philosophy for clout. People can feel when it's performative.

  * *Real “smart” people make others feel smart too*  
    * Charisma researcher Olivia Fox Cabane (author of *The Charisma Myth*) says one of the most underrated social skills is making others feel seen and heard.  
    * Don't debate just to show you're right. Ask thoughtful questions. Build on what people say. The smartest person in the room is usually the one asking the best questions, not giving the longest monologue.

  * *Consume better inputs = Speak better outputs*  
    * You don’t need a master's degree. You need better content hygiene.  
      * Podcast recs: *The Daily Stoic* (bite-sized philosophy), *Modern Wisdom* by Chris Williamson (deep dives), *Hidden Brain* (psych + behavior science).
      * Books: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (for self-control), *Range* by David Epstein (for being a generalist and sounding smart in any convo), *The Art of Thinking Clearly* by Rolf Dobelli (for not sounding like a dummy online).
    * These sources help you speak with nuance, which is the *actual* trait people associate with intelligence.

* **Don’t perform either identity—live in the tension of both**
  * *Drop the need to prove you're hot or smart. That’s what makes people “cringe.”*  
    * Trying too hard = insecurity. Whether it’s showing off your abs or flexing your bookshelf. Truly magnetic people know when to shut up and when to drop something interesting. They're not always optimizing to look good. They’re just present.

  * *Mix high-low energy. It's more compelling.*  
    * Stephanie Foo (author of *What My Bones Know*) talks in her interviews about “emotional layering”—messy people who are still grounded. This applies to social energy too.  
    * If you're always calm and cool, you feel robotic. If you're always bubbly, you come off scattered. The real power is in being able to shift between depths and surface-level fun. Know when to drop a literary reference and when to laugh at dumb TikToks. That combo? Golden.

  * *Don’t chase “main character energy.” Focus on *real* main character behavior*  
    * That’s not walking in slow-mo with a coffee. It's:
      * Taking care of your mental health (shoutout *The Psychology of Self-Healing* podcast)
      * Keeping your promises to yourself (aka not flaking on your habits)
      * Having a sense of purpose that isn’t just aesthetics

So yeah, being “hot and smart” is totally real. But not the way TikTok sells it. It’s less about stacking features and more about subtracting the noise. The more you simplify your look, your mind, and how you show up socially, the more magnetic you become.

Not perfect. Just intentional. And THAT is peak hot-smart energy.",2,1763578025.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

I spent a lot of my childhood in Ybor City, and I’m looking for a perfume that will remind me of one of 7th street’s old cigar shops. (Unfortunately, I can’t find any indie makers in Tampa who might make this scent — but please correct me if I’m wrong.)

After some research, I think I’m looking for notes like:

- cigar smoke
- dry cigar tobacco leaf 
- tobacco flower
- Spanish cedar (closer to mahogany than other cedars)
- heavy, hot humid air (that the humidors are unsuccessfully trying to keep out)
- leather (maybe)
- coffee (maybe)
- sugar or sugarcane (maybe)
- fresh Cuban bread (in my dreams, but might as well include it here)
- bay leaf, bay laurel, or bay rum (the earthy herbal note is somehow so reminiscent to me)

I tend to love warm, dark and rich scents, and I’m open to all the creative methods that perfumers would employ to round out these notes (especially fruit). I would also welcome any animalic notes, like musk or sweet sweat. (You do tend to sweat like the dickens in Florida.)

TLDR: Before I go the custom route, does anyone know of a scent that make you feel like you’re on the patio of a cigar shop?

And if I do go the custom route — whether a perfumer blends, or it’s just me at home with some single note oils — do you have any houses whose versions of these notes you adore?

I bought this on ebay (came from japan) for $200 (tax and shipping to chicago included)


Going into my search for a writers deck I wanted:  something reasonably priced for a single use device, known to work well over long periods of time, something i can open up on a plane to use without feeling like I’m disrupting my neighbors nap time) 


Pros
- robust clamshell device with decent bones, feels as good as any low priced laptop
- navigation (easy to put menu in English and navigate the settings with the arrow keys)
- screen…I actually enjoy having a backlight on a screen this small because combined with my blue light glasses I can write sustainably without eye strain
- laser focus! I sat down right when my adhd meds started working for the day and next thing i know i wrote 10k words 
- uses double a batteries and so far battery life has been fine. I do think I’ll have to keep extra batteries with me which I’m fine with
- simplicity…the device is so simple to use, nothing fancy and for some reason that really makes me feel grounded (cheesy ik)
- doesnt draw too much attention (when Im at a coffee shop sometimes my alphasmart or freewrite alpha makes me feel like hey!! look at me im a writer or some one comes to ask me what this cool device is that im using and both scenarios make me cringe or interrupt my flow)

Cons
- spacebar (its hard to strike with the side of your thumb if you're a touch typer)
- keyboard layout is japanese (key things: the quote key is shift2 and the apostrophe is shift7)
- keyboard feel… if youre used to mechanic or split keyboards in your desk set up this will feel like a worlds difference (but i am getting used to it)
- needed a lap desk for writing in lap (its hard to just sit it directly on lap and write it feels too minuscule/ the device wiggles around)
- its a little funky when I try to connect it to my macbook pro directly but the SD card transfer is smooth so I just do that

Overall: 1 alphasmart, 1 freewrite alpha, and many months of agonizing over whether to pull the trigger on the Traveler. This device has satisfied the itch I was having for the perfect writers deck. 

If i was to add anything else to my collection it would be a clamshell with a more spacious (preferably low profile mechanical) keyboard that is chargeable by usb c. ",11,1763577904.0,writerDeck,6,0.93,False

I posted a tread asking you guys about your coffee preferences. 
It got removed. Apparently brewing coffee is not considered “cooking” to the Bot. 

As I have said before in other post, I have been a Chef for a long, long time. I look up to many of the Masters of cuisine. And hold their philosophies close to my heart. 

Ferran Adria in one of them. 

Head Chef at ElBulli. One of the absolute best restaurants that has ever been. And the Mecca of Molecular Gastronomy’s invention. 

 Ferran Adria says cooking is “the transformation of food to make it more palatable”.  He states that “there is a very fine line where cooking starts”. He contrasts “cooking” with eating a product in its upmost raw form. Such as an apple of a vegetable. 

So, tell me? 

What do YOU consider *Cooking* ?

Is brewing coffee beans “cooking”, per se?  Tea?
Is Ceviche “cooking”, even when all the ingredients are marinated in their raw form?

This should make for a very interesting discussion.

For some background, this person has lived with my roommate and I for two years, and in the past she kept to herself because she was horribly depressed. She was still mean and nasty, but since she didn't really leave her room it was easy to live with. Recently she's been feeling ""better"", which has meant she is constantly taking up a ton of space and pulling the house into her extreme emotional spirals. I come from a family with an NPD parent, so I'm no stranger to cluster B personality disorders, but BPD isn't something I have personal experience with. (At least not with someone so disordered) I'm also a therapist, and my background is in familial trauma.

The ""big"" blowout that set off the current spiral was me asking her to... Do her dishes in a timely manner. Now, I'm trained in doing this and don't argue with people, but before we could even talk about the issue she first started sobbing and making excuses, then she started yelling and trying to blame me, and then finally she acted like everything was fine and she ""totally got it"". She tried to say it's hard because we all have different communication styles, to which I point out that, in fairness, I am paid for my ability to communicate. She then spent the next day passive aggressively ripping all of her things out of shared spaces, loudly moving things and complaining to herself while she did so. My assumption is she doesn't want to share things? I... Didn't react because I'm not giving into passive aggression, and she kind of wore herself out and went back to ""normal"". Normal, of course, is acting like we are all BFFs and that nothing weird has ever happened ever. She doesn't realize it, but after the latest tantrum(there is much more to it I'm not listing here) she has basically burned any emotional bridge she had left in this home.

I'm not sure if my post belongs here because, honestly, I do not consider this person a part of my life and, if anything, merely wish to survive her behavior while we wait to remove her from the lease upon re-signing. I am tired of every conversation becoming a litany of insults and accusations, I'm tired of her coming in hot and then needing to ""regulate"" while she speaks out loud at me, and I'm tired of never knowing what to expect from this, frankly, constantly disregulated person. We're all in our 30s, and everybody else in the house has a job, hobbies, and interpersonal relationships we are trying to focus on while this (unemployed and supported by family she doesn't talk to) person tries to use us as her own captive audience. It's frustrating to be spoken to like a despised, useless spouse by a person who struggles to feed herself consistently. Some behaviors that baffle me that I'd love commiseration or help on:

- The constant performative crying. It's weird for me to say but the sobbing doesn't feel... Right or real. Again, I'm a therapist, my mother had NPD, and I'm a naturally empathetic person. Anytime this person has sobbed(yes, wailing and sobbing) it has felt viscerally performative and gross. One example is I came downstairs before work one day and she started *sobbing to me* about how hard it is to... Feed herself every day. (Meanwhile I'm just trying to make my coffee to start *my work day*) We are talking leaning over the sink, head thrown back wailing. I didn't respond because I thought it was a joke at first. Another time she allowed our cat into the crawlspace(long story), and sat against the wall, head back and wailing again, because ""how was I supposed to know?"" I was, of course, actively solving the problem she herself had caused. When I needed her to pass me something the tears immediately stopped. It's gotten to the point where I don't even look at her when she does this.

- She will just re-arrange our home, often moving shit that isn't hers. When spoken to about this her only answer was ""I don't know what I'm going to do until I do it"". We told her that is her problem and she needs to communicate. This changed nothing, of course.

- It is as if she has never lived with another human, because she will take up common spaces and just treat them as hers. She has done this constantly with our three season porch, setting up art supplies and plants in there so there is no space for anyone else. Once that was finally cleared, she just moved half of her furniture in there and spends every hour of every day in there. It's one of those things wjere I don't even know where to begin, because I don't know why I need to explain public space to this person. Any time this is brought up she acts like it's an assault on her person. 

- She's incredibly ignorant but acts like the only one of us that has her shit together. For context, in two years she has never held down a job because she has no ability to cope, she doesn't do chores but acts like she does it all, has picked up multiple hobbies that she gives up when it becomes clear she needs to learn something, etc. What really gets me is both my roommate and I have traumatic childhoods, and both of us have had to build a life for ourselves despite this. This person has a similarly shit childhood, but acts like nobody could ever even fathom the pain she is in, all the while she is being 100% supported financially by this family she claims to hate. Meanwhile, I put myself through graduate school alone and am saddled with debt for getting myself *out* of a situation like that. The dramatic irony is insane.

- I have no other way to say this, but she's just... Dumb? I don't think intellectually she is, but it seems like because her emotions are so big she can't actually take in new information because any new information challenges her self concept. A great example is she is ""growing"" crops... From seeds from the grocery store. She kept them on a 3 season porch that gets 4 hours of direct sunlight a day, some of them don't even have any leaves left on them, and now they are sitting outside(we made her remove them finally because she wasn't treating them for a fly infestation...) in November in New England dying. She still ""tends"" to them every few days. Anytime someone asks how long she wants to keep them, she gets defensive and responds *she* will decide when harvest season is over. It's as if being incorrect or ignorant is so scare she would rather pretend she knows everything and stumble through life. This aspect is particularly difficult, because it is impossible to predict what this person ""doesn't know"", because they seem to lack all common sense or perspective outside of their own. 


These are just a few of her... Charms. Honestly, at this point I intend to grey rock her until she is out, because I didn't figure all of my own shit out just to be the unwitting emotional support for a woman with the emotional regulation and capability of a child. The worst part is I do this for my job and love it, but do not want to do it for free for someone in my home who treats me like shit. ",3,1763577662.0,BPDlovedones,3,0.81,False

1p1fw66,https://i.redd.it/yf9km5t6592g1.png,If you've been asking and waiting for a Flipgrid alternative...,"Here is what I think it should look like:

* A great web-based recorder that works across browsers and devices, that's smoother than all the clunky alternatives.
* That will allow you to record your face as well as the screen, and draw on top of it.
* That you can easily switch between these modes without losing a beat or going back to the screen-sharing window selector.
* That should allow you to pause the recording, so you can catch your breath or sip a coffee and master your thoughts before you hit continue.
* An open or private space that you can embed or link anywhere.
* Any moderated or auto-publishing topics you have control over.
* And only members you approve can post...
* Unlike Flipgrid, when you submit a video, it should not belong to the grid admin; you should own the video. The admin only controls what to show or hide in their spaces.
* If you submit a video to a moderated topic, you should still be able to view the video before the admin approval, and pull back the video before or after the approval.
* It should look modern, fast and sustainable to run, with inclusive and generous free plans, so it won't have to close within a couple months' notice.

I was a Flipgrid community member (somewhat of an insider, if you will). I know there was a lot of angst unleashed after the closure, dissatisfaction with the non-answers from official channels. But I know all the details of how Flipgrid used to work, and I was an online async instructor and Flipgrid user, and also coincidentally, a dev and builder. So I have spent the last year working on a solution; it's now quite ready to be tested. The recorder should be ready after Thanksgiving for everyone to use (for free forever, you can download the video without uploading); then I'll invite interested users to create spaces and invite students. I need this community's help to walk the last mile, to validate if I'm building the right thing, for the right people, in the correct order.

If you are still looking, or if you have already settled on a replacement but felt like something is missing, DM or comment what Flipgrid meant to you, and what the next platform should look like, and your most frequent use cases. Maybe we can make it real.

1p1frjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1p1frjx/dear_j/,"Dear ""J""","To someone I used to write to once upon a time ago:


Now *you* I haven't written in almost half a year, but today I choose to break that silence that slowly permeated my self. 


I want you to know how much I miss you, and how much I wish we could have played a larger role in each other's lives. I know I didn't play much in yours, but your presence in mine was larger than you ever could have imagined.


I used to write to you here nearly daily, sometimes multiple times per day, unable to express what I wanted to express to you and the world and coping the best way I knew how with everything going on in my life.


I want to apologize with what happened, especially during my psychosis when I sent post after post to you on Instagram. I honestly believed you were some sort of video game character in a sense, and I genuinely believed during that raw time in my life that I was helping you get through your own life.


I also want to apologize with how I was afraid to get to know you. There were several factors that lead to that, and the largest was the one I used to call *Sister*, with whom I now know was never a sister to me, or even a friend.


I remember her crying to me ober the table, holding my hand telling me she never felt like this for anyone, letting me know how she cheated on her husband with you and that she had fallen in love with you. I was so lonely that I took this in stride and in confidence and kept it to myself outside of what I told you. You see, I didn't see properly. She painted a miserable picture of her marriage, and suddenly a block between me and you went up because I didn't want to add to her pain.


I should have told her to go pound sand after all that I've learned over a year later. I know she went out of her way to learn your schedule, learn the places you go, and took what she knew of me to wedge herself firmly into place. She manipulated me, lied to me, and stole from me, and I still have some hurt after her betrayal.


I should have made a better effort to get to know you, should have been more forthright and honest with myself. I regret it deeply to this day. In the last near three years the only person I had been physically intimate was you, and with my dopamine and serotonin deprived brain *you* made an impact that no one ever has before in my life.


Before you eye contact, especially prolonged eye contact was something I had issues dealing with. And how I craved your eye contact, because it was the first time it finally felt that someone saw me, wanted to get to know me without that undercurrent of wanting to own me. I remember you looking at me through the doorway and imagined you appreciating the dance I took on during the hours of obligation.


You were always on my mind, and how I wish I could have reached out to you. But when I did, there would be no response. It slowly began to break my heart, and I split into two, compartmentalizing myself in order to survive.


When you would respond, or when you would reach out first.. oh heavens I wish I could better word this. Perhaps I might even try writing this again in a better place, somewhere I feel creative. I wish I could reach out to you again, or that perhaps you would reach out to me. Sometimes I think you think of me when I feel a certain way and wonder if you wonder what I'm up to.


I wish we could sit down and have a coffee and conversation. I suppose closer would be the desired outcome, but truth be told, I wish for friendship and you will always have a place in my heart. I hope that perhaps I have a place in yours, even after all I put you through. This spring and summer I wasnt in control of myself, my brain was being starved and tortured and I was going through hell.

The only person to be honest enough with me was you, and I crave that. It doesn't help that you have the most beautiful deep brown eyes, ones that didn't hurt to look into like a majority of the eyes in the world that could see deeply into me.


I  remember once when you stated that anyone could sign these letters any way they could, in particular ""president obama"", and I hope you know how much of an impact you had on my life.


I dont know if you read here anymore, or even visit reddit, but I hope in some twist of fate that you see this and recognize this letter for what it is. My path is healing, and I'm more myself than I have been in ages, though some days all I feel capable of is superficial and surface level thoughts.


I really do truly miss you, and I hope you are happy, healthy and well. I no longer call you Texas Toast, and no longer fear you or your world shaking presence. I hope you no longer fear my presence and understand what I went through was out of my control. Just like when I tried to call you and chickened out about leaving a message and thought everyone thought I was a man.


You were the only person who told me you hoped I get the help I needed. 


I want you to know I got that help, got medication, and no longer have a diagnosis. I was terrified I was schizophrenic, but I was in a deep psychosis from a myriad of effects and reasons, and I wish I could talk with you about it all. I think you'd be the only person who would understand and ask all the right questions without feeling pity for me. I dont want to see the pity in people's eyes anymore. 


I miss you, and I hope you're well.

Rick Halden wasn’t a monster or anything. He was one of those loud, broad-shouldered firemen who made every story about himself. The kind of guy who’d tell you about a house fire he’d put out in '08 like it was Vietnam. Still, he'd been part of the fabric of this place. And in small towns, even the people you don't love feel like pillars.

But the mood at his funeral wasn't grief.

It was fear.

There were no tears. Instead, people watched on, whispering, glancing over shoulders at shadows that weren’t there.

To the side, Mrs. Harlan kept repeating, “It’s earlier than last time.""

Two old men stood behind me near the tree line, speaking low as the pastor droned on.

“It’s started again.”

“Twenty-seven years, like clockwork.”

“Thought we’d get more time.”

I pretended not to hear. I grew up listening to this kind of nonsense. Stories about the “Black Cycle,” about the “curse,” about how every twenty-seven years someone would die in a way that “didn’t belong to the world.”

To me, it was always just superstition layered over tragedy.

Small towns love patterns, even if they have to invent them.

But this time... this time felt different.

Because nobody had an explanation for how Rick burned to death inside an empty grain silo.

There wasn't an investigation. No state fire marshal. Nothing. All he got was a closed-casket funeral and a quick burial before anyone from outside town could ask questions.

And the silo itself?

I drove past it on the way to the service. The whole structure had been reduced to a perfect black circle of ash on the ground, like someone had dropped a giant branding iron on it.

Rick had been in the center. What was left of him, anyway.

After the service, people lingered in clusters, talking like frightened cattle.

Then the whispering started:

“It’s the vault. The vault’s waking up.”

That’s when I knew I wouldn’t sleep if I didn’t see the site myself.

I waited until sundown, until the sheriff’s car was gone and the road was empty, then drove out to what was left of the Halden silo. The fields were quiet, the air unnaturally still.

The ash circle felt... wrong. It didn't look charred in the way you'd expect. More like the ground had melted.

I crouched, brushing my fingers across the surface. The concrete was glassy and smooth, fused into a dark, rippled shape.

And in the center, where Rick had died, the scorch mark curved into an oval, wide at the ends, narrow in the middle. Jagged around the edges, almost like teeth. A mouth. An open one.

I stood slowly, feeling a cold bloom in my chest. Like recognition, though I didn’t know why.

I left before my mind could make sense of what I’d seen.

That night, I dreamed I was underground.

I wasn't buried in dirt, buried in bone. In a coffin made of interlocking teeth.

And above me, something massive exhaled.

Something waiting.

And hungry.

\-

I didn’t go to work the next day.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that shape burned into the silo floor, those jagged edges, that impossible symmetry, like a fossil of something that had taken a bite out of the world.

So instead of clocking into my job at the hardware store, I drove to the town museum. It was like an overgrown attic. Cold, dusty, full of things nobody wanted to throw away or remember.

I told the curator I needed to do some genealogy research. 

“Archives are downstairs,” she muttered, barely looking up. “If anything bites you, it’s not our liability.”

Nice.

The archive room smelled like yellowing paper and mildew. Rows of metal filing cabinets containing stacks of old town ledgers, and newspaper reels older than anyone alive in town.

I started with obituaries.

1890s.

1910s.

1930s.

1950s.

A pattern began to emerge before I even wanted to admit I saw it.

Every twenty-seven years, the death count spiked.

An old man wiped out in a house fire.

A pastor found hanged in his own church rafters.

A child drowning in a lake during a drought.

Just like the stories.

Then I found the 1998 folder.

It contained detailed council minutes. And they were terrifying.

There were references to a “Selection Committee” and a “Recipient List.” The names were blacked out with heavy ink strokes, but the phrasing was unmistakable. 

One entry read:

“Consent acquired. The vault remains sealed.”

What vault?

What consent?

I flipped page after page, hands sweating, until I found a single note clipped to the inside cover:

“If the list is incomplete, notify the elders. No cycle can begin without unanimous selection.”

That was the first moment I felt something twist in my gut.

Something had gone wrong this year.

I pulled an old town survey map, spread it across the table, and started comparing landmarks mentioned in the minutes.

A creek that dried up in the 60s. A road was rerouted in the 40s. An old settlement boundary.

Then I found it.

A place marked only once, in tiny faded letters:

VAULTMOUTH.

It was deep in the woods, far beyond the main trails- so remote it wasn’t on modern GPS.

A place nobody talked about. A place meant to be forgotten.

And judging by the council minutes... deliberately avoided.

I was stuffing the documents back into the folder when a chart slipped out. A folded piece of thick, brittle paper. Looked like it hadn’t been touched in decades.

On it was a family tree of the original settlers of the town, with dozens of names and dozens of branches.

Most of them were crossed out with a red pencil.

And when I saw my own last name, my stomach dropped.

My family’s branch wasn’t crossed out.

It was circled. Hard. Several times. Deep enough to bring up the fibres of the paper.

And next to it, written in the same red pencil:

“Next to seal the mouth.”

The room felt suddenly smaller. The air grew colder, and the hairs on my arms stood at attention, sending chills down my spine.

I stood there staring at that circle, that message, feeling like a hand had reached out of the past and grabbed the back of my neck.

Whatever was happening now... my family hadn’t just been part of it. We were at the center of it.

\-

There were only two elders in town who had lived through the 1971 cycle, and one of them didn’t talk anymore.

The other was Delores Kindt.

She lived in a faded yellow house on Birch Lane- the kind of place that looked like it should’ve caved in years ago but by miracle stayed standing. I’d seen her at the grocery store sometimes, pushing an empty cart, mumbling to herself.

Some said she had dementia. But I also heard she’d watched her entire family die throughout a single October.

I figured both could be true.

I knocked on her door, but there was no answer.

I was just about to leave when a shadow moved behind the curtains, and the locks clicked- one, two, three, four.

She opened the door just wide enough for one eye.

“You’re... the Moorcroft boy,” she said.

I didn’t correct her. I wasn’t sure if she meant my father or me.

Her living room smelled like dust, medicine, and old, damp carpet. She shuffled around in slippers, muttering, “Tea, tea... do I make tea...?”

When I told her I had questions about the past, she stopped moving.

Just stopped.

Her back stiffened, and she turned her head in a way that made my saliva taste like despair when I swallowed.

“What year is it?” she asked.

“Two thousand twenty-five.”

She sucked in a sharp breath.

“That soon,” she whispered.

She wandered to her recliner and sat down hard, hands trembling.

I pulled the chair across from her.

“Delores,” I said quietly, “I need to ask about 1971. About your family. About the deaths.”

She didn’t react.

Until I said the word:

“Vaultmouth.”

Her eyes snapped to mine, clear as crystal. Like the fog lifted all at once.

“You shouldn’t know that name,” she exclaimed. “Only the chosen and the choosers know that name!”

“I found documents,” I said. “Council notes from 1998. Mentions of a selection committee.”

She let out a shaky laugh. “No one chooses anymore,” she said. “That’s why it’s angry.”

Then, her voice dropped to a rasp. “It doesn’t want a person. It wants the choice. That’s the pact.”

I swallowed. “What happens if there’s no choice?”

She leaned forward, gripping the edge of her chair with white-knuckled fingers.

“If the town does not give, it takes. And it will keep taking until the mouth is full.”

Her eyes suddenly darted to the window, like she expected something to be peering in.

Then her expression changed. Went blank. Fog rolled back in.

She looked lost.

“What were we talking about?” she murmured. “Do I... do I know you?”

I stood to leave.

But before I could make it two steps, her hand shot out and grabbed my wrist.

Hard.

Her voice was clear again- sharp, urgent. “Say it out loud. Say a name. With intent. It listens.”

Then, like a switch flipped, her grip loosened and she sank back into the recliner, staring at the far wall. Her mouth moved silently, like she was praying to something that wasn’t God.

I left her house trembling.

As I stepped onto the walkway, the sound of screeching tore down the street, then a horn, followed by a sickening metallic crack.

About fifty yards away, a car had slammed into a telephone pole. The front end was crumpled like an aluminum can. Steam billowed from the engine.

But what shocked me wasn’t the crash.

It was the open driver's side door, swinging gently.

No one inside. There wasn't a trail leading away, no blood or body from the impact.

A shiver crawled up my spine.

This wasn’t the first death.

This was the beginning of something feeding.

\-

The map said it was called Vaultmouth, but the land around it had no name. No roads. Just a thinning treeline off Route 19 and a path that felt like it hadn’t been walked in decades.

I parked where the road turned to gravel and followed the rest on foot, shouldering through brush, slipping down embankments, boots snagging on hidden roots. The air got heavier the deeper I went. 

Eventually, I found the fence. Or what was left of it.

Rotting wood posts spaced unevenly around a clearing, wrapped with crumbling barbed wire and rusted iron nails- half driven in, half bent outward. Faded signs dangled by one hinge, words long gone, but symbols still visible. Circles. Spirals. A mouth full of triangles.

Latin etched into the boards, almost burned in.

Non eligimus carnem. Carnem eligit nos.

(We do not choose the flesh. The flesh chooses us.)

It wasn’t just creepy. It felt deliberate. Like a warning whispered by dead hands.

I stepped over the boundary.

The trees stopped. All life absent. The soil turned ashen. The center of the clearing was perfectly flat, ringed with pale stones half-sunk into the earth.

And in the middle... was a hole.

At first glance, I thought it was a well. But on closer inspection, it was a smooth vertical shaft, wide enough to drop a body into without folding it. The inside was black, no bottom in sight. And around the rim, the stone had been carved in a tight spiral- grooves that curled downward like something had dragged claws around the edge a thousand times.

Just clean, dry stone. And the faint hum of... pressure. Like the air was breathing in and out.

I picked up a pebble. Held it for a second. Then dropped it in.

Nothing.

No click or bounce. Just... gone. Like the earth swallowed it before it hit bottom.

Near the lip of the shaft, embedded in the ground, was a slab of metal, iron gone orange with age. Bolted down with thick rivets. Names etched across the surface in uneven, hand-carved rows.

Dozens of them.

I ran my fingers across the grooves, reading aloud.

Many I didn’t recognize.

Then, near the bottom, one I did.

Walter Moorcroft. My father.

The last name on the list.

My breath caught in my throat.

He’d never mentioned this place. Never said a word. But somehow, he was part of it. He knew.

I left the clearing as fast as I could without running, like turning my back on that hole too quickly might give it permission to reach for me.

The sun was starting to set by the time I got home.

I opened the door to my trailer. And there he was. Sitting in my kitchen.

No call or warning. Just there.

His eyes were sunken. Shirt still half-buttoned. Knees jittering.

His voice came out flat and shaking.

“You shouldn’t have gone there.”

I hadn’t seen him in months. We weren’t estranged, exactly- we just moved around each other like planets on different orbits. He only ever showed up when something had gone wrong.

And something had gone very, very wrong.

He looked older than I remembered. Drained. His shirt was unbuttoned and crooked. Hands shaking. Eyes bloodshot with tiredness, like he'd been up waiting for something.

“Sit down,” he said.

I did. Because the tone wasn’t optional.

He lowered himself into the chair across from me, elbows on his knees, breathing slow and heavy like he had to convince his lungs to keep working.

“I know what you’ve been looking into,” he said. “The archives. Delores Kindt. The vault.”

Hearing him say it out loud felt like ice water poured down my spine.

“Dad... what is it? What’s in the vault?”

He looked away, jaw clenching.

Then he said the words that would ruin everything I thought I knew about this place:

“The town isn’t cursed. It made a deal.”

He rubbed his face with both hands.

“Back in 1890,” he said, “the founders struck a pact with whatever lives under that ground. They called it the Mouth. The Deep. The Listener. It doesn’t matter what name you use.”

He swallowed hard.

“We promised it a life every twenty-seven years. Just one. Chosen willingly through the vote. And in return, it left the rest of us alone. Something horrible was happening to the settlers. Something so horrendous, it wasn't even recorded. The deal was the only way to survive.”

My stomach twisted.

“You’re telling me... this town has been sacrificing people?”

He didn’t flinch.

“Willingly, yes. Always with consent. Always someone who accepted it. A quiet death. A clean one. And the vault stayed sealed.”

I must’ve made a face, because he added,

“You think they wanted to make a deal? That they didn’t try leaving?”

He shook his head slowly.

“People did leave. In the early years, whole families packed up wagons and tried to outrun it. Didn’t matter. Wherever they went, something followed. Things would start to happen. Their crops would rot. The ground would go dry. Children would get sick. And then...”

He held up one trembling finger.

“One death. Always one. Something final. Like the mouth needed to remind them: you can’t cheat hunger. You can only feed it.”

He leaned back, jaw tight.

“That’s why they settled it in 1890. Not to keep people in. But to keep something from following them out.”

I shot to my feet in shock.

“I know what it sounds like,” he snapped. “I know. But you weren’t here for the years when the vote didn’t happen. When people doubted. When they resisted.”

His eyes had gone distant.

“Those years were hell.”

I paced the room, trying to process it all.

“So what happened this time?” I demanded. “Why did the fireman die? Why are people disappearing? What changed?”

My dad leaned back and stared at the ceiling as if the answer was written there.

“This year,” he said quietly, “nobody could agree.”

I stopped moving.

“The council argued for months. Half the elders died off. The younger generation doesn’t believe. They think it’s all folk tales.”

He let out a bitter laugh.

“Turns out, belief doesn’t matter. Responsibility does.”

Then, softly- “There was no vote. No selection. No name offered.”

I felt my mouth go dry.

“So the fireman-”

“Was taken,” Dad said. “But it doesn’t count. It wasn’t the ritual. It wasn’t a willing offering.”

He leaned forward, eyes burning.

“It has to be chosen. Not just a death.”

The words sank into me like hooks.

Because suddenly the pattern made sense.

The random vanishings. The crash. The way the air felt charged and wrong.

The pact had been broken. The vault was hungry. And there was no offering to stop it.

I sat back down slowly. He watched me. Something unreadable in his gaze.

“Okay,” I whispered. “So what now? If the sacrifice wasn’t made... what does the vault do?”

For a long moment, he didn’t speak.

Then he inhaled sharply, like the next part hurt to say.

“Then it's up to the Collector.”

I frowned. “What does that mean-?”

He didn’t let me finish.

He looked at me with an expression I had never seen on his face before.

Terror. Grief. And something like an apology.

“The Collector isn’t a person,” he said. “It’s a role. Passed down a bloodline. Every generation has one.”

His voice cracked.

“And if the town won’t choose the sacrifice... the Collector must.”

A cold pressure settled behind my ribs.

“No,” I said. “Dad, no. You’re not saying-”

He closed his eyes.

And then he said it, voice barely above a whisper, the words I didn't want to hear-

“It’s you.”

\-

After my father left, I didn’t sleep.

I sat at the kitchen table thinking about the name etched into that rusted iron plate: Walter Moorcroft. My father. The previous collector, now passed on to me.

And I couldn’t stop thinking about the way he’d looked at me. Like I was something he was sorry for, not something he loved.

I knew he hadn’t told me everything. Not even close. So I broke into the locked footlocker he kept under the guest bed.

He always kept it bolted shut, like he thought someone would try to steal his old hunting gear. But I knew the combination. Same one he used for everything.

Inside? Not weapons or tools. Just... journals.

Stacks of them, weather-warped and yellowing. Page after page in my father’s tight, careful handwriting.

Most of it was nonsense at first-weather reports, council meeting notes, obituaries with names underlined and circled. He’d been tracking every cycle since before I was born.

But then the language changed.

He stopped writing like a man, and started writing like a witness.

One page read:

""It speaks in symbols now. Dreams. The hum in the trees isn’t the wind, it’s waiting for its name to be spoken.""

Another:

""When the Collector is called, the chosen cannot offer themselves. The Collector must choose. This is the pact, the old way. Not by death. By rite.""

The words ""COLLECTOR"" and ""VAULTMOUTH"" appeared again and again.

Sometimes capitalized. Sometimes underlined in red.

And next to them: crude diagrams of the Vault.

The shaft. The spiral. The concentric rings of trees around it, marked with strange glyphs. Some looked like runes. Others like teeth.

One diagram showed a person standing at the edge of the Vault, with arrows pointing inward, as if their presence activated something. Opened something.

Then came a section I hadn’t expected. Returning back to the style of a journal. Detailing day by day beats of a tense time in the town.

It spoke of apocalyptic symptoms. The lake changing color, the sky casting strange hues, and the wildlife losing their minds. People disappeared, and families were torn apart. All because Walter, my father, could not choose. 

It mimicked the current time. The council not choosing, and the decision falling to the Collector. An impossible choice of life and death. One to die, for many to live. 

That night, the Vault came to me again in dreams.

But this time, I wasn’t inside it. I wasn’t falling.

I was standing above it. At the edge. Looking out at a crowd of people.

Kneeling.

Hands clasped. Heads bowed. Whispering something I couldn’t hear.

And I was speaking. My mouth moved. My voice was not my own. And the Vault opened.

\-

It started with the birds.

Every morning, my porch railing used to be dotted with crows, the smart, spiteful rascals that lined every wire in this town like little black judges. Then one morning, they were all just... gone.

That same day, a field of cows on the west end of town was found standing in perfect formation- heads lowered toward the ground, unmoving. Every single one of them dead, bloodless, organs folded inside out like paper crafts.

Two nights later, I heard something boil. But not from the kitchen, from outside.

I looked out and saw it was the lake... an entire body of water roiling like a pot left on too long.

Wakes Pond, the old reservoir where we used to swim when we were kids, steamed for ten hours straight. The water turned thick and red. Fish floated to the surface, split open.

The air changed after that. Smelled wrong. Sweet, but spoiled. Like rotted peaches or burned teeth.

Something was opening.

I wasn’t the only one who noticed.

The few remaining town elders, the ones who still remembered how this thing worked, called a secret vote. 

They held it in the old stonehouse outside Mill Creek. The kind of place built with no insulation and too many locks.

Only six of them showed up.

They tried to vote. They tried to choose a name. But the vault didn’t care anymore.

It had waited. Been ignored. Denied its due.

Now it wanted me. Not as a meal. As a mouthpiece.

I didn’t hear this secondhand.

One of the elders, a retired judge named Hal Vesser, came to my door at dawn. His eyes were bloodshot. His knuckles scraped like he’d punched something harder than he expected.

He sat on my porch swing, hands trembling as he lit a cigarette.

“We failed it,” he said.

I didn’t speak.

“You’re the last stop. You understand?”

I just stared.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“The Collector exists for a reason, in case of breakdown. When the people can’t choose, the blood must. You’re not a sacrifice. You’re the priest. Just speak a name, with intent. That's all you have to do. If you need suggestions, I can-”

I told him to get off my property. Told him I wasn’t killing anyone for a town too cowardly to face its own history.

“You’re not killing them,” he said.

“You’re offering. That’s different.”

I slammed the door.

But the ground... kept humming.

That night, it got worse.

The sky turned the color of old bruises. The clouds spiraled low and fast like water being sucked down a drain.

My neighbor’s trees bled sap that smelled like iron.

Dogs stopped barking. In fact, dogs stopped moving.

A low bell began to ring from nowhere. No visible source. Just there, vibrating through the soles of your feet.

Something was uncoiling.

The Vault wasn’t sealed anymore. Not fully.

At 3:21 a.m., my phone lit up with a message from an unknown number.

Just one line:

“Choose.”

By morning, Delores Kindt was dead.

She’d been found in her bed, peaceful. No wounds. No trauma. But her face was smiling. Hands folded like in a church pew. And between her palms...

A yellowing card.

Handwritten.

Addressed to me.

“Name the chosen.”

\-

I knew where they’d kept the records. It wasn’t a secret.

The room was beneath the old town hall, not in the modern wing, but in the original limestone foundation, where the smell of mildew soaked into your tongue and the light buzzed like an insect was trapped behind your eyes.

It was still unlocked.

They hadn’t even tried to hide it. Maybe they wanted me to find it.

The Selection Ledger was a thick, clothbound book that looked like it belonged in a courtroom or a church. Heavy. Frayed. Smelling of dust and smoke and human oil.

Inside: names.

Page after page, each handwritten in looping cursive, some dated over a century ago.

I flipped forward. To the most recent year. This year.

The first few pages were normal.

Just names. Birthdates. Occupations. Handwritten summaries of each candidate’s community standing, financial status, and family size.

Then I started seeing the red circles. Suggestions for choice, a shortlist for them to vote on. Alongside them were stern judgments, marked with phrases like “Approaching end-of-life,” or “Minimal surviving kin,” or “Historically low civic contribution.”

And then added on, were notes. Not from the elders. No, their handwriting was firmer, direct. But younger handwriting. Softer language. Correctional, even.

MARLENE GILLARD - 84

“She still tutors at the library. Her great-granddaughter just got accepted to college. She brings hope to the family. This would destroy them.”

TOMAS HARVEY - 58, disabled vet

“Still teaches woodworking. Mentors troubled kids. Has PTSD- wouldn’t be ethical.”

ALICIA NORRIS - 41, chronic illness

“Started the Grief Circle after the 1998 death. Still manages the town website. Would send the wrong message to others with chronic conditions.”

GEORGE AMBLIN - 71, ex-convict

“He served his time. Runs the food pantry. His death would confirm every stereotype the town's trying to grow past.”

Every single name was paired with a counterpoint. Every sacrifice was dismantled by empathy.

The deeper I read, the angrier I felt- not at them. But at how familiar it was. How easy it is to rationalize inaction when action feels monstrous.

This wasn’t corruption. It wasn’t bloodlust. It was compassion.

They had tried to be better. But better didn’t stop the Vault from waking. Better didn’t boil the lake. Better didn’t spare Delores. 

Or was it ignorance? A new wave of leaders who wrote off tradition as ignorance. Something to move past.

The final page wasn’t even finished. Just a handful of names with red ink scratched through, like someone had grown furious and thrown the pen across the room.

In the margin, one line of newer handwriting:

“There are no perfect deaths.”

Another, in pencil:

“Then maybe we stop pretending it’s worth choosing.”

And under that, scrawled in dark pen, pressure piercing through the paper:

“Then we die together.”

I closed the book.

The Vault was right. This wasn’t a sacrifice anymore. It was a failure.

That night, I dreamed of the spiral again. Only this time, I descended.

No ladder. No rope. No footing. I just fell, gently, as if the air below me had turned to water.

The stone walls pulled away as I went, becoming ribs, then roots, then rows of open mouths, all breathing together, in rhythm.

And at the bottom, where sound should’ve vanished into nothing...

There was light. Soft. Living. Like a heartbeat under skin.

I didn’t hear anything. But I felt it.

Behind my eyes. In my gums. In the marrow of every bone.

“The town agreed to the cost,” it said.

I turned.

And around me were reflections.

Other towns. Other timelines. Each one was different, and in all of them, the Vault had gone unsealed.

One showed spirals of fire coiling up into the sky, turning birds inside out in flight. Another: a town square full of kneeling people, mouths sewn shut with gold thread, trees grown backwards through their skulls.

In one, the Vault was gone, not sealed, but absorbed. As if it had eaten the land around it and kept growing.

They were all worse than anything I could imagine.

And every one of them had something in common: No choice was made.

I woke up with my pillow soaked in sweat and my tongue heavy in my mouth like it had been speaking without me.

Despite all I had seen, in what I could call more a vision than a dream... I still couldn’t pick one name.

\-

I didn’t call a meeting. But they came anyway.

One by one, the elders filed into my living room. Some looked resigned. Some looked angry. Some looked like they hadn’t slept in days.

And behind them, the younger council members slunk in with the stink of guilt on their faces.

No greetings or small talk. Just expectation.

Judge Vesser was the first to speak.

“It has to be now,” he said. “We’ve run out of time.”

Another, Miller, ran a hand through her hair, shaking. “You’ve studied the list. You’ve seen the sky. You know what happens if we don’t-”

My throat tightened.

“I’m not choosing,” I said. “Not one. Not any of them.”

A long silence. Then something changed in the room.

The faces of the younger members, those who had written all the gentle notes in the margins, all the reasons why each circled name shouldn’t be chosen, shifted.

The sympathy drained. The humanity dimmed.

A man named Devlin stepped forward, jabbing a finger at the ledger on my coffee table.

“Just pick someone from the marked list,” he snapped. “Anyone. Marlene is old. Norris is sick. Ellroy’s basically retired. It doesn’t matter- just choose.”

These were the same people who had written:

“She’s a pillar of her family.”

“He volunteers more than anyone.”

“She gives hope to the community.”

Now they spoke like accountants balancing a ledger.

“It’s between them or us,” Devlin said. “Don’t act like it’s complicated.”

Something inside me curdled.

I shoved the ledger away, sending it skidding across the floor.

“If you want a name so bad,” I said through my teeth, “pick one yourselves.”

“We can’t,” Vesser whispered. “It won’t listen to us anymore. It only listens to the Collector.”

“Well then, you’re all screwed,” I said. “Because I’m not playing priest for a monster.”

The idea of getting blood on my hands to save these people ready to condemn another, with a responsibility I didn't ask for, was too much. 

The room went dead quiet.

Everyone stared at me like I had just set the house on fire.

But nobody said a thing.

Nobody argued or moved.

They just stood there- waiting, hoping fear would make me fold.

And then the door exploded inward.

My father stormed in with the force of a man who had been running for miles, eyes wild, hair slicked with sweat. His voice hit the room before he did.

“You stupid boy!” he roared. “You think this is a joke?! You think you get to refuse?!”

I thought he was going to just yell. Maybe shove me. Maybe try to scare me into it.

I did not think he would tackle me to the floor.

My head hit the hardwood so hard stars burst behind my eyes. Before I could breathe, his hands were on my collar, dragging me up and slamming me back down again.

“Say a name!” he barked. “Just say the goddamn name!”

At first, I thought he was bluffing, losing control in panic.

But the weight on my chest didn’t lift. And his fists didn’t stop.

My vision blurred, white at the edges. My teeth rattled with each blow.

Behind him, the elders stood frozen. Not intervening. Not helping. Watching things play out, not knowing which side to take.

Some horrified. Some... relieved. Watching action they must have dreamt of doing, but didn't have the guts.

My father leaned close, breath hot on my cheek.

“You're supposed to keep it sealed. You're supposed to be better than this,” he snarled. “I had to do this, too. Just do it.”

Another blow. My skull screamed.

“No wonder your mother left. No wonder I left. You were always weak. Always a disappointment. Just like now-”

He wasn’t trying to scare me anymore.

He was trying to kill me.

My ears rang. Blood filled the back of my throat. The world tilted sideways.

I felt myself slipping- consciousness slipping… dissolving. Like the Vault was already tugging at me.

And in my delirium, one thought surfaced:

I didn’t have to choose from the list.

I could choose the one trying to kill me.

My lips moved before I fully realized what I was saying.

I whispered my father’s name.

Barely audible. Cracked. Broken.

But true.

The second the consonants left my mouth-

The weight vanished.

Gone.

My father wasn’t sprawled over me anymore, a soft death like a heart attack or stroke.

He wasn’t in the room. He wasn’t anywhere.

A moment ago he was beating me into the floor. Now there was only air. And silence.

A few of the elders gasped. One crossed himself. Another woman looked away, trembling.

No one said a word. Because they knew what I had done.

And worse- they knew what it meant.

The room emptied in minutes.

No goodbyes. No reprimands. No condolences.

Just fear.

They fled like they expected the house to collapse the second they crossed the threshold.

I was left lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling, my heartbeat hammering in my teeth.

Eventually, I stood. Walked to the window. The sky was clearing. The clouds unraveling. Colors returning.

The hum in the earth finally quiet.

It was over.

Just like that.

My father was the sacrifice.

And the town…

The town was safe.

For now.

\-

The town healed fast.

That was the strangest part.

In the weeks that followed, life returned to a rhythm- not the same rhythm, maybe, but something close enough to pass for normal. The sky lost its bruised hue. The trees stopped leaning in. The power lines stopped whispering.

People got up and went to work.

The butcher reopened.

The school held a bake sale.

The lake was still red, but no one talked about that.

The Selection Committee resumed their meetings, quieter now, fewer members, and fewer words spoken when they left those rooms. Once, I used to see them as elders. Guardians. Wise men and women holding ancient truths. Now, they looked like exhausted survivors, scared of what might come next.

I never went back to their meetings. They never asked me to.

But there was one thing left to do. One door I hadn’t opened.

My father’s house sat just off the main square, tucked between two identical ranch-style homes. I'd driven past it a hundred times without thinking. I don’t know what I expected, but when I stepped inside, it was exactly what I’d feared.

Sparse furniture. A sink full of old dishes. Frozen dinners stacked like bricks in the freezer. A recliner with an ass-groove too deep to undo, facing a TV tuned permanently to the sports channel.

It was a life half-lived. Lonely. Mechanical. Gray.

I stood in that room for a long time. It smelled like dust, coffee, and a man who didn’t know what to do with silence.

And then I saw it- a folded piece of paper, sitting on the coffee table.

My name was written on the front in my father’s blocky, stubborn handwriting.

I opened it.

'If you’re reading this, then I went through with it.

I’m sorry you had to see it. Sorry you had to be part of it. I didn’t want that for you. Not ever. That’s why I left.

But I had to make sure you’d do it. I couldn’t risk you freezing up the way the others did. I know you- I raised you. You were always the good one. Even when you were little, you gave away your Halloween candy to the kids who were too scared to trick-or-treat. You used to cry when you saw roadkill. That’s the kind of heart you have. Big. Honest. Kind.

But a heart like that won’t save this town. It never has.

I said things I didn’t mean. Did things I never wanted to do. You have to know that. I needed to make myself into the enemy. I needed to give you someone worth condemning. If you hated me enough to speak my name with weight... then you’d survive. And the town would, too.

That was always the deal. One name, spoken with intent. That’s how the Mouth knows the offering is real.

It had to be me. I was already halfway gone anyway. I’ve been watching the sky for years now. I could feel it- the teeth behind the clouds, the pressure in my bones. It was coming. And you were going to be the one it turned to.

So I gave you something to aim at. Me.

I’m proud of you. Not because you did what I wanted. But because even after everything… I think you hesitated.

Don’t let this town break you. You’re not like the rest of them. Keep being the kind one, even if it hurts.

All my love,

Dad'

I sat down in his chair.

It didn’t feel right. Didn’t fit me.

But I sat there anyway. And I cried harder than I had in years.

Not because he was gone, or because of what he did. But because I understood.

And I hated that I understood.",1,1763577109.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

We were supposed to go out for coffee this Thursday. She just texted me to ask if I will be available, to which I said yes, but then added: “Oh, but I have to bring my baby, is that okay?” I have noticed that whenever she asks something like this, it’s like she’s setting me up for failure, because if I say no, then I’ll be “the bad friend”. I am tired of this dynamic, and I’m tired of putting her comfort first all the time. So, I decided I won’t see her. If I knew she is not the type of person to try and make me hold the baby or change diapers, I would not care. But if I am really honest with myself, she is totally that type of person and I just don’t want to use the scarce free time I have to be an unpaid babysitter.

We're talking finish-each-other's-sentences, know-what-the-other-is-thinking-with-a-single-glance kind of close. Life happened, as it does, and now we live on opposite sides of the country, but that bond has always felt as strong as ever.

About a year ago, I was just going about my day—making coffee, answering emails, the usual boring stuff. Suddenly, out of absolutely nowhere, I was hit by this overwhelming wave of pure dread. It wasn't just a bad mood; it was a physical sensation, like the air was being sucked out of the room. My chest got tight, and I had this horrifying feeling of drowning, of just absolute, soul-crushing despair. It was so intense I had to sit down. The only thought in my head was, 'I have to call her. Right now.'

My hand was shaking as I dialed her number. She picked up on the second ring, and I could tell immediately she was crying. Before I could even ask what was wrong, she told me. Her mom, who had been sick but was thought to be stable, had passed away unexpectedly just moments before. The timing was exact. The wave of grief I'd felt wasn't mine—it was hers. I had felt the most painful moment of her life from a thousand miles away.

We've talked about it a lot since then, trying to make sense of it. It was both terrifying and strangely comforting to know our connection is that deep. It’s one thing to be emotionally in sync with someone, but another to physically feel their emotional state from a huge distance. It’s left me wondering, has anyone else experienced something like this? Is there a psychological term for this kind of intense empathy or connection?",1,1763576258.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: Washington Capitals vs. Edmonton Oilers (NHL, 11/20/2025)**  
*“The Capitals and Oilers are like two sleep-deprived baristas trying to make lattes at 3 a.m.—everyone’s tired, mistakes are inevitable, and the coffee’s probably cold.”*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Tired Teams

The **Washington Capitals** (-115) are slight favorites, but don’t let that fool you—they’re playing on fumes. Since November 12, they’ve played every other day, and their “balanced schedule” sounds like a dare. Their defense is decent (2.5 goals allowed per game), but their offense is only average (2.8 goals per game). Key players like Tom Wilson (18 points) and Dylan Strome (16 points) are their best hope, but Pierre-Luc Dubois’ absence (abdomen injury) leaves a hole in their attack.

The **Edmonton Oilers** (-105) are the underdog, and for good reason. Their defense is a sieve (3.5 goals allowed per game), and their goalie, Stuart Skinner, is statistically the NHL’s version of a sieve with a PhD in “I give up pucks.” Connor McDavid (30 points) and Leon Draisaitl (24 points) are elite, but injuries to Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Kasperi Kapanen have left their attack depth looking like a deflated balloon.

**Key Statistic**: The combined average goals per game between these teams is **5.8**, just shy of the 6.0 total set by bookmakers. Fatigue and defensive lapses? That’s a recipe for a high-scoring, chaotic game.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Fatigue, and the Curse of Back-to-Backs

* **Washington’s Woes**: The Capitals are playing their 5th game in 9 days. Their “balanced schedule” is a lie. Pierre-Luc Dubois is out, and their defense relies on Logan Thompson’s .924 save percentage to hold the line. Think of them as a leaky dam holding back a hurricane—eventually, water (goals) gets through.
* **Edmonton’s Exhaustion**: The Oilers are coming off a brutal stretch, including a 1-5 loss to Buffalo. Their “rebound” game? More like a rebound from a trampoline that forgot to bounce. With Ryan

1p1f8db,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1p1f8db/25_days_in_china_an_absolute_horror_trip_and_what/,25 days in China: An absolute horror trip! And what I've learned.,"Hey.   
I just came back from a **3,5 weeks trip** from China last week.   
It was my first time in China, the longest and most expensive vacation I've ever done.  
And it was absolutely horrible - but that was not China's fault, I was just INSANELY unlucky.  
  
**Why it was horrible:**   
\- I was sick the first week with a sore throat and a cold, so was limited in what I could do.  
\- Out of 25 days, it was constantly raining (a lot!!!) and even a snowstorm on 22 days (I was constantly wet, had to throw away my shoes as they didn't survive never being completely dry throughout the entire trip and having wet feet when it's quite cold didn't really help recover from my cold ....) - is it ever sunny in China? .....  
\- In Jiuzhaigou it was so incredibly crowded - even for Chinese standards - I couldn't see the stairs properly slipped with my foot and injured it so from week 2 I couldn't walk properly ...  
\- And upon arriving at Shanghai airport (my last stop) I started throwing up the second I arrived at the airport hotel, was out cold for 2 days with a high fever and hotel staff wasn't very helpful in getting me some toast and bananas once the throwing up stopped, I almost starved to death as I couldn't leave the bed and was travelling alone, absolutely miserable ...

  
**Important take away:**  
A lot of the recent information I found on Reddit was not up-to-date anymore:  
  
\- It says you can visit **Tiananmen Square** on the same day of your Forbidden City ticket. This is not true. You need to get a separate reservation at least a day ahead to be able to visit Tiananmen Square, it has nothing to do with your visit to the Forbidden City. Consequently, I couldn't go, unforatunely.  
  
\- **Jinshanling Great Wall** section: is supposed to be less touristy. I can't confirm. I went during the week in mid-October and it was pretty crowded and loud there - still quite nice.  
  
\- **Crowds:**   
Yes, there are a lot of crowds, but not where I expected them.  
Here, I was told that especially **Tianmen Mt.** and **Zhangjiajie National Park** would be insanely crowded, but they weren't, at all...... and it was quite easy to navigate as there were a lot of foreign tourists and a lot of the signs were in English.

On the contrary, **Jiuzhaigou National Park** was the worst experience I've ever had in my life in terms of crowds. I should have known already when the highspeed train tickets sold out the second they were released on 12306...... I didn't see any other foreigners when I went there. I was at the park's entrance gate before opening time and yet had to line up with billions of people. It took at least 1h to get in, just to then line up for the shuttle busses. So much squeezing, pushing etc ... this is also when I finally injured my foot .....   
The nature there couldn't be enjoyed due to the massive crowds. At each viewpoint you had to line up for 20-30 minutes until you got close enough to even take a photo.   
Also, getting tickets for a shuttle bus back to the highspeed train station was also utterly difficult and they were booked out quite fast, had to opt for a more expensive option and the driver was an hour late etc. HORRIBLE!  
I would NOT recommend going there it's NOT worth it - there are similar sceneries in Europe or Canada etc. without entrance fees and crowds ....  
However, I would recommend going to Huanglong, it's easier, it's not as crowded and it's a truly special sight that you don't get anywhere else (apart from maybe Turkey).

**VPN / esim:**  
I had 2 phones on me. Both Pixel phones. Big mistake. I couldn't get my Pixel phone to connect to any WiFi not even with (**Mullvad**) VPN. I had a Xiaomi tablet with me that could connect to most WiFi with the VPN just fine ... I did try some of the tricks mentioned online for Pixel phones, but Google and China ... it just doesn't work. Also, walking into phone accessory shops, they have so much stuff but NOT for Pixel phones. Just be aware.  
With the esim I never had any issues. There were 2 times when I didn't have any reception for some time and that was near the Yangshuo Railway Station and between Huanglong Railways Station and Huanglong Scenic Spot. I opted for 50GB for 30 days, but ended up only using about 14GB for 25 days.

**Alipay / Wechat:**  
Mostly it worked for me. For payments I mostly used Alipay and only when it didn't work switched to Wechat. Sometimes when you have to scan something to pay it wouldn't work on either of them ... eventually they gave me something else to scan and then I could pay.  
**Didi didn't work properly** for me, so I had to take taxis instead on serveral occasions. The GPS within the app was completely off, so sometimes when I needed a pick-up, the pick-up location was so far off that I had to cancel the Didi (which costs a fee) and then had to find a taxi instead. I never figured out why the GPS was so off ... maybe because I have a Google phone? ... but that was extremely annoying especially when you were in a hurry ....  
I once had to **rent a powerbank** using the mini app in Alipay which is all in Chinese .. it worked, but I didn't know that I had to scan the code again after I had returned the powerbank. I found out hours later, but apparently you can just go to any other Meituan powerband station and scan the code there, luckily ... I just had to pay more because a few hours have passed ... AND I never got my deposit back. I found out that you have to actively demand the deposit back in the app - which I did and then it worked.

**Trains and subway:**  
I saw so many foreigners in front of ticket machines in the metro and never understood why. You can simply activate a metro card for most major cities within Alipay free of charge(!!) and then you just swipe the QR code and it automatically pays the travel fee. It saves so much time, why buy individual tickets and waste time?? It's easy to set up. Just navigate to the ""Transport"" tab and choose the city and you're good to go. In the beginning you might need some verification process.

For trains I mainly used **12306** although I have to admit that I had various issues with the app. First, I couldn't verify any of my e-mail addresses and then when I was already in China not all of my booked tickets were showing up (I had to use the website instead because you need to be able to access those if you want to change anything - which I had to do constantly...). Changing tickets in the app (given that it works) is super easy. Especially, if you just want to take a later train (same destination) you can do that without any additional cost (as long as tickets are not sold out). But you can change a ticket only ONCE. After that you can only cancel it and book a new one - and cancelling comes with a fee, esp. if it's 48-24h prior to your actual trip.  
Considering how often I changed or cancelled train tickets it would have been waaaaay to expensive to use Trip.com. I would only recommend doing that if you don't have too many train trips or you can't get the 12306 app to work.  
I found it sad that you cannot choose your seat in the English version. I always ended up in a coach furthest away and usually never got a window seat.  
As for, how early you should be there, it completely depends, really. I never had to wait long at security check, but for bigger stations it takes some time to get from A to B and then to find your ticket gate, to actually go there and for bigger train stations they often start 20-30 mins prior to departure with the ticket check while for smaller ones, they won't start until 10 mins before departure ... but it's always better to be there too early rather than too late.   
As a foreigner, you always have to use the ""manned"" ticket gate and on some ocassions there were SO MANY foreigners that we were about to delay the train as we couldn't all check in on time, so at some point they were just letting all the foreigners through without checking their passports.... ;) ..... 

**Food:**  
Well, I can't eat spicy, but have no other food restrictions. I ended up eating meat almost every day. Not always was the meat of good quality.. But most of the dishes were delicious. But I ended up with food poisoning and to this day I don't know what it was because when I started throwing up I hadn't eaten anything for 8h+ .... and I didn't have any street food on that day either.... (and no I didn't drink tab water...)  
They have some really interesting coffee variations there like with sparkling water, plums inside, mixed with orange juice ... but all of them were interesting and surprisingly delicious. 

**Language barrier:**  
Wow, this was huge! Much bigger than expected.   
I used to live in Japan for many years and worked there as an English teacher and we were always told that China and South Korea are far ahead when it comes to English education. Now, I know this was a lie. Uff ...  
I was expecting that at least people working in tourism in the big city would have some proficiency in English, but nope. They don't even know ""yes"" or ""no"".....   
As I was travelling alone, I was so happy when I met other foreigners, not matter from where because naturally they all could speak English - mind you my native language isn't English either .... so it was nice to have a proper conversation without any phone translation.   
That being said I still had some nice conversations with locals, taxi drivers etc. but it was all via the phone translator which felt a bit weird. :)  
Being fluent in Japanese, I could understand some of the Chinese characters of course, but in terms of conversations this doesn't help at all. And oh boy, do they hate the Japanese! I saw some food stalls with text like ""Japanese are not welcome"". Uff .....  
But I met a few Japanese tourists and at certain tourist spots they had explanation signs in Korean and Japanese, sometimes even Russian, so ....

**Safety:**  
Female solo traveller. Just like in Japan, I felt absolutely safe in China and I knew it wouldn't be an issue. Crossing streets was probably the most dangerous thing because zebra corssings and red lights won't stop them from overrunning you. Haha ....   
Also, I felt the air quality was much better than I thought it would be.   
I probably wouldn't recommend going to China and to AAAAA-ranked spots when you're pregnant because of all the squeezing and pushing it might be a bit dangerous for the unborn child ... I myself got quite a few bruises through that, so ....  
And I never understood why they're doing it. They were walking super slow the entire time, so obviously they'e not in a hurry, but as soon as it was about to board a shuttle bus (coming every 2 mins), they were pushing and shoving around as if their life depends on it because they couldn't wait for the next bus.   
  
**Noise:**  
There was not much traffic noise because of the many electric cars, but it was still super loud because they honk constantly. Also, I feel that Chinese people have not understood the concept of headphones. In trains or subways, nobody seems to use them, they all just have their phones on max volume while watching videos etc. It's always super loud. And needless to say, that they're speaking very loudly wherever they are, so my ears are still ringing from all the noise. ;)

**About the places I've visited:**  


**Beijing:** (3 days, see above)  
  
**Datong: (2 days)**  
I really liked it there. For me, the Hanging Temple was totally worth the trip. I've never seen anything like it.  
Datong City was also impressive. All the new skyscrapers and then the old ancient city center within the city walls. I quite liked it, although again it was raining heavily on my second day there, so I couldn't explore much .... the grottoes and the wooden pagoda are also a must-see.  
I had a private driver for day 1 where I visited the pagoda and the hanging temple and it wasn't super expensive, I think I paid like 500yuan.

**Xi'an (2 days).**  
Apart from the famous army I didn't see anything else because of torrential rain and flooding when I was there. Every other day before and after that - still to this very day was absolutely lovely, sunny and great .... how much bad luck can you actually have? ... I stayed there 2 days and those were the ONLY two days with horrible weather ...

**Chengdu Pandas: (1 day)**  
As I was there on a weekend I decided not to go to the huge base close to the city center, but to the Dujingyuan panda valley which only has around 10 giant pandas. But I'd rather see 10 of them close-up without too many people vs. not being able to see 100+ pandas due to the masses. Pandas were still active and eating at around 10:30, I entered the park shortly after 8:30. The only difference is that in the beginning I almost had the pandas to myself and the later it got, the more crowded it became. And yes, they also have red pandas roaming around freely. :)  
Also, the Dujingyuan Irrigation System and Ancient Town are very beautiful, you can do that and the panda valley in one day and the waterway is lit up in the evening, so you might want to stay until it gets dark. :)

**Leshan Buddha (1 day):**  
Friends of mine visited just a few days before me and told me as it's dry season the water levels are so low that no tourists boats are running anymore. Due to the constant heavy rain wherever I went, I was at least ""lucky"" that the water levels were suddenly so high that tourists boats were running again ... I did both, the hike and the boat tour and it was not rushed at all. Unfortunately you couldn't walk down beside the Buddha as the trail was closed off ....

**Huanglong and Jiuzhaigou (2 days, see above)**

**Fenghuang and Furong (0,5 days each):**  
I liked both, but if I had to decide on only one I'd personally go with Furong. It's more compact, it's more picturesque and I just liked the waterfall a lot. :) But you can't go wrong with either of them. Didis and taxis were no problem at all, although Reddit tells you a different story... Especially in Furong they're VERY used to foreign tourists! They even hand you a map in English right when you leave the train station. Fool-proof.  
For either of them half a day is enough. You should stay until the evening when they light up everything, it's quite nice and there are night performances as well. It was a bit hard as it was raining a lot (as everywhere I went...), but still nice ....  
It was not a problem to leave my luggage at Fenghuang Railway Sta. for a small fee (I think it was 20 yuan), I think it was also possible in Furong.

**Zhangjiajie (1 day):**  
Mt. Tianmen was supposed to be the absolute highlight of this trip (besides the Great Wall). Unfortunately, although I went in the early morning and stayed until sunset, I couldn't see anything. It was so cloudy / foggy the entire day and never cleared up. In fact, it was scary because you couldn't see more than 5m ahead of you. I chose route B and when I arrived at the platform from where you can see the stairs and the heaven's gate, I just heard people's voices, but I didn't know where to go, I tried to find a restaurant or something to sit to wait for it to clear up, but unless you were standing RIGHT in front of it, you couldn't see shit .... I'm so, so disappointed. Consequently, it wasn't crowded at all ...

**Zhangjiajie National Park (2 days):** It was not crowded. Yes, of course, there were a lot of people but nothing compared to Jiuzhaigou .... I was there on a Friday and a Saturday. I spent 2 days in the park itself. Not sure if you really need 2 days, because the views become somewhat redundant to be honest. But I didn't have the energy to go to the Grand Canyon due to all the bad luck, the foot injury, the constant rain ....   
I managed to see Yuanjiajie, Yangjiajie and Mt. Tianzi on day 1 without being rushed at all (plus a few viewpoints that are between Yangjiajie and Mt. Tianzi (get off the bus at the intersection and take a mini shuttlebus to the viewpoints, which costs extra money).  
On day 2 I explored the Yellow Stone Village (which is nice but REALLY redundant at this point..) and walked along the Golden Whip Stream. This is actually nice because you get a different perspective, walking along the stream looking up to the rocks, so if you have time, that's also nice. There are a lot of monkeys along that trail, be careful.   
Finally, I walked along the Ten Mile Gallery, but I would say this can be skipped. Again quite redundant.

**72 Wonders Building in Zhangjiajie:** This looks amazing, especially when lit-up at night. I wouldn't pay the high entrance fee. Taking photos from the opposite street should be enough, especially if you're short on time.

**Guilin / Yangshuo / Xingping (3 days changed to 4 days):**  
This was supposed to be another highlight of the trip and the relaxing part, but .... again heavy rainfall and it was quite cold. Guilin had 27°C and sunshine on pretty much every day apart from when I was there, when it suddenly dropped to 13°C and due to the heavy rain it felt even colder ....  
Consequently, I couldn't do or see that much ....   
  
**In Guilin (0,5 days)** I went to see the Elephant Trunk Hill (free admission). You can also go up the hill which I recommend because you get some nice views, but when I was there, the ""normal"" way up was closed, but there was still another way to go up there. The Sun and Moon Pagoda are also nice. You can either just take photos from far away or pay an entrance fee to go up to both pagodas for interensting views and the two pagodas are connected via an underwater tunnel that you walk through, so that's quite cool.

The next day I was in **Xingping (1 day)** where I wanted to do a few hikes, but the weather was so horribly bad .. I just took a quick photo of the 20 yuan bill view while my actual 20 yuan bill was dripping wet after only a few seconds ... I took a bamboo tour but that was very unpleasant due to the heavy rain and cold weather .... I assume it's amazing on any other day .... I hiked up Laozhai Mt. but didn't see anything because the weather was so bad. There are signs everywhere telling you it's a super dangerous hike. Nope! I did it in the WORST weather ever with rain covers over my shoes and even then it was not difficult at all (but I'm an avid hiker, so ...)  
Getting off at Yangshuo Railway Station was one of the very few ocassions when my [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) esim card didn't work, so I had to pay the bus to Xingping with cash. Keep that in mind if you go there.

**Yangshuo (1 day changed to 2 days)** was nice. Still, the weather sucked. On my second day there it finally stopped raining and I was able to do a bicycle (not electric bike!) tour. That day, due to lack of information and lost in translation I started first at the G. Bridge cycling along the Ten Mile Gallery to the Moon Hill, but it's not very beautiful there. Then I took a shuttle bus to Jima Pier, from where I started walking - the area there is SO BEAUTIFUL! Luckily, at some point I came along another rental shop and got a bicycle and then rode it all the way to Fuli Bridge (which I also recommend).  
I spontaneously decided to stay another day, so I had to cancel my super expensive train ticket to Shanghai (or rather postpone it) which did cost mit almost 200yuan .... but instead of going to rainy Shanghai I opted for ONE rain-free day in Yangshuo instead.  
I then did the TV tower hike which I didn't want to do, but it was better than nothing. Honestly, the view is not that great and if you have the chance, I'd rather do some hikes in Xingping (which I couldn't due to the super bad weather).... and then I took a taxi to Cuping Hill which I HIGHLY recommend. However, it's in an absolutely remote area, so I asked the taxi driver to wait for me, because NO TAXI OR DIDI would come to pick you up there ever .... he then showed me another viewpoint as well.   
I then decided that I needed to get the lost day in Shanghai back, so I cancelled my train ticket yet again (another 200 yuan byebye) and spontaneously booked a flight for the late evening from Guilin to Shanghai which was absolutely no problem and it was actually cheaper than the highspeed train ticket which was interesting because when I planned my trip the plane tickets were three times the price of a train ticket, but oh well ... I had to pay for overweight luggage because I didn't plan to take the plane and my luggage was already quite heavy at this point ... once I arrived at Shanghai airport I got a Didi to a nearby hotel and then I started throwing up, having the most miserable time yet of the entire trip.   
The next day, having a high fever, I could not possibly leave the bet, let alone check out and move to the next hotel in the city center of Shanghai ... so half-dead as I was, I had to chat with the hotel I was currently staying at if I could just stay another night in the current room, had to kindly ask to cancel the other hotel, they wanted 80€ cancellation fee .... it was a nightmare ... eventually I didn't even know if I could fly back home in that state ....

**Shanghai (4 days, but 2 of them sick in bed)**  
Eventually, I recovered and had 1,5 days to explore Shanghai. I went to a watertown, went to Suzhou for half a day and checked out the famous skyline of Shanghai. That's about it. Everywhere it was croweded although it was during the week. Absolute madness.....



I know this was a loooooot of text, but I hope that this is still helpful for some of you.  
Feel free to ask me any questions. :)

You know, instead of just hitting snooze 5 times and wondering if coffee counts as a spiritual guide. 

Here’s how it went:

1. **Meditation**: Sat cross-legged on the floor, trying to channel my inner zen. Ended up channeling my inner ""why did I skip leg day?"" instead. 

2. **Affirmations**: Repeated “I am powerful and unstoppable” while simultaneously contemplating whether I should order breakfast or just wait for lunch. 

3. **Nature Walk**: Took a stroll outside to connect with Mother Earth. She seemed to be saying, ""Can you keep it down? I'm trying to grow some trees here!"" 

4. **Gratitude List**: Wrote down three things I’m grateful for, but only managed to think of two. Gotta love that third spot pressure! 

5. **Spiritual Selfie**: Captured the moment with a filter so bright, I might just blind my followers. #BlessedNBlurred

In conclusion, waking up spiritually is a journey, not a destination. And if all else fails, at least I’ve mastered the art of looking deep in thought while sipping my coffee!

Thank you Nice lady.,"So there is a lady that comes to the coffee shop (Tim’s). She is so thoughtful and sweet . She had asked me the other day if I wanted coffee and I politely replied thank you but I am fine. I was preoccupied and on the phone and she looked jilted and she said next time then and I said sure. Well today was the day and she again asks “you want coffee”? And I look up and said sure , remembering my promise last time. She said medium and I said sure and I added with cream. So away she goes and comes back with my coffee. ☕️ I said where is yours ? She said “ oh you don’t worry about me I just took pills and I am off to get my snow tires on”. She went away again and drove away with a box of donuts for the tire shop for while she waited. This lady clearly was on a mission of kindness  tis the season for receiving the unexpected. I am glad that I could make nice lady’s day by accepting. She seemed so happy when I did. It made me feel special too knowing that she seemed happy that I accepted her offer today. 
It might be a simple cup of coffee but it was the idea 💡 that a simple agreement of sure could make someone’s day when it was me who was benefiting from the kindness but rather not prehaps, in this case it seemed to go both ways with giving and receiving and a win win to brighten the day ☀️ ",34,1763576093.0,randomactsofkindness,7,0.98,False
