Because she vomited this morning as she is sick and clearly unwell. Idk what to tell her.","How do I even start. 
I don't know what to say, I'm speechless. My father 51 M is an alcoholic, not a bad person. He has a somewhat of a good heart but when he's drunk he becomes mentally abusive. 

He never put hands on my mom 48 F Mainly because I think he's far too scared to do so. 

Never necessarily put his hands on anyone ever, my mom used to be a Judo medalist and has a fair share of putting men in their place, she however. Could. 

This morning they fought just like any other, I'd casually stop the video I'm watching to hear what comeback they are gonna throw for fun and hear comebacks such as:

-You can't see anything besides that bottle. 
-Dont fuck around with me. 
-youre stomping on my brain all morning man where do you turn off.?!?! 

(All these but in yelling by my mom) 

My father blasted music inside the house and turned the tv volume up. 

My mom is sick, shes quite literally coughing-vomiting has some kinda virus in general. 

I walked into the living room and looked at the speaker and told him ""turn this down will you."" 

He got all upset turned it off slammed the remote on the table same for the TV 

I said ""thanks"" and went to the cough to watch smt. 

He told me to get ready because he's gonna take me somewhere to drink coffee, quite frankly I ignored that because he was intoxicated and I didn't want to argue with someone out of their mind regardless. 

He asked ""can I turn on the speaker""

I said ""sure but tune it down"" once he tuned it down he got pissed turned it off again and then started getting ready to leave 

Ofc my mom worried as always asks ""where are you going?"" 

He cussed at her said fuck off kinda and stormed out of the house, 

My mom came up to me and told me he has been asking her who got her knocked up last night and that she's surely pregnant because she vomits

Also said to what I strongly agree 

""He can take holiday leave and has several days off while I have to work on holidays and barely get a day off even when I'm sick, he has it easier but wonders why it's Im sick"" 

I'm like ""yeah facts"" but genuinely idk what to say else. 

My family isn't good on communicating part. I'm usually there to stop the argument and either escalate it to another level or leave it entirely. 

I tried arguing with him before but it's really hard when someone is so self absorbed and jealous over nothing.

My lesson of the day for you, if you're dating someone who seems jealous over you hanging out with friends. Dump them. Because 20 years down the line the minute you're sick they will accuse you of cheating on them or being unfaithful. 

Now I need your lesson of the day. 

What do I say to my mom after this. This just happened so I'd appreciate help. ",1,1764756889.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1pd0etw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pd0etw/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_celebrate_christmas_with/,AITAH for not wanting to celebrate Christmas with my sister in law,"Last year my daughter was stillborn. It was the hardest time in my life and although I since had a little boy, I am still very much grieving. 

When I lost my little girl I initially received a text from my sister in law (my husband's brother's wife) saying she was sorry. She was pregnant herself at the time. Then it was crickets. So many people sent flowers or dropped off food or checked in via text. Although they lived extremely close at the time we weren't checked in on by them. 
A couple of weeks later I received a celebratory group text in which they announced their baby's gender. It felt inconsiderate and like a stab to the heart. Everything was still very fresh. 

A few weeks later I saw her at a local event where she sat across from me at the table but ignored me and never asked me how I was doing. She loudly complained about how hard it was for her not to drink alcohol due to her pregnancy. Eventually I addressed her and told her that I was sorry if my loss had dampened their joy and that their baby deserves to be celebrated. I also said that I was a bit disappointed that they hadn't reached out more. She immediately became combative and said that if she were in my position she wouldn't want anyone to reach out to her. I told her that she doesn't know what she would want as she had never been in this situation. She became really aggressive in tone and told me that she lost her dad at a young age and insinuated that this was way worse than me losing my baby. It went back and forth and she eventually just turned her back to me. I started crying and my friend had to walk away with me and help calm me down. I was very hurt. 

I didn't hear from her after that and when their baby shower rolled around I bought some gifts and my son and husband attended. A few weeks later a thank you card came in the mail that was only addressed to my husband and son. Again: what a stab in the heart. I just didn't understand who would do this to a grieving mother. 

My mother in-law was very upset about not spending Christmas together and treated me like I was the bad guy for saying that I needed space. I was hurt. Every time I would go over to her house there would be baby items for the new grandchild everywhere. She didn't seem to understand my pain. She kept telling me how hard things were for HER. I felt so bad that I sent a text to my sister in law saying I wished her nothing but the best for the upcoming birth of her kid and that maybe one day when life felt less heavy we could grab a cup of coffee. 

No response. 

Fast forward a year later. We haven't talked since. Christmas is coming up. My mother in law asked me if we could all be in the same room together. Now that I had another baby she acts like everything is fine and forgotten. I told her I would have to sit with it. That the thought of seeing them caused me a lot of anxiety and that I still feel very hurt. I didn't say no. I just wanted to be honest about my feelings. Now my mother in law is not responding to me. 

There is no timeline on grief. I never received an apology for how she treated me during the worst time in my life. She never even reacted when I extended an olive branch. Which wasn't my responsibility to begin with. I know it sucks for my MIL but I am supposed to care how she feels when she literally ignores that I am in pain. It hurts me that I am being vulnerable about how I feel and she literally ignores it. 

Am I the asshole for struggling with the idea of spending what should be a peaceful holiday with people who have caused me pain? ",1,1764756600.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

**Chapter** 1 

On the eve of Isabelle Darroch’s wedding to Matteo Norkett, paparazzi caught him hanging out with an intern from his company late at night. 

In a fit of rage, Isabelle bought a plane ticket, trying to get away for a 

bit. 

But when she opened her eyes again, she found herself five years in the future. 

Panicked, she tried calling her parents, only to find that their numbers no longer worked. 

When a message appeared on her computer saying “This identity has been deregistered due to death,” it nearly knocked the wind out of her. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks, dripping onto her phone screen. 

The screen lit up, revealing her wallpaper–a wedding photo of her and Matteo. 

Isabelle finally realized who she could turn to. 

She quickly unlocked her phone and called Matteo. 

She held her breath, counting each “beep” from the receiver. 

Then, a familiar voice came through. “Hello?” 

The worry in Isabelle’s heart suddenly lifted, and all her frustration and confusion spilled out at once. · 

“Honey, something weird just happened… I’m really scared. Can you come get me?” 

After a moment of silence, Matteo calmly replied, “Okay.” 

\*\*\* 

It wasn’t until Isabelle stepped into the familiar office that she finally felt like things were real again. 

She threw herself into Matteo’s arms and cried her heart out. 

After what felt like forever, Matteo frowned and gently pulled her away. 

“Wait, are you saying you traveled through time?” 

Isabelle nodded quickly, but Matteo let out a cold sneer. 

“You really think I’m going to buy that? Five years ago, you never showed up at our wedding, and now, you come up with this ridiculous story.” 

“You don’t believe me?” 

Just a few days ago, they had taken their wedding photos together. But right now, the guy in front of her felt completely unfamiliar. 

“How can I believe any of this? 

“Five years ago, you vanished without a trace. Our engagement turned into a joke. And your parents died in a car accident after searching for you for days without sleeping a wink.” 

Isabelle shut her eyes tight, feeling a wave of pain wash over her as she tried to calm her shaking body. 

15 86% 

After a while, she finally managed to find her voice. 

“What about you? Did you even try to look for me these past five years?” 

Matteo didn’t reply, just giving her a cold stare. 

Just then, a soft voice sounded as the door creaked open. 

“Honey, I brought you some coffee…” 

Isabelle froze, and the blood in her veins seemed to have turned to ice.

KEIRA'S POV
Sitting on the roof of my old house, looking at the sky full of endless stars, I was thinking about my purpose in life. Have you ever felt like you do not know when it will be your last moment on this earth, so you want to do all those things that you wanted to do in life but cannot do? I do not have any control over my own life. My so called parents do.
I do not have anyone in this world to fight for me or love me. I have nothing ; nothing to lose, nothing to gain and nothing to hope for. I am simply surviving, not living but surviving. Alive physically but dead inside.
Feelings should have an on-off switch. To block out all those hurtful comments from everyone around me and all the pain that I feel. If only it was that easy. But I somehow learned how to survive. I learned the harsh reality of the world when I was a mere child.
When children my age should be having fun and enjoying their lives, I am here trying to survive. But this is the reality and it is always better to accept the truth than to live in denial like I did in starting. Because after the denial phase is over and the harsh reality dawns over, it just hurts even more.
My parents never liked me, hell they hated me and they never failed to show their hate towards me. Endless years of abuse, in all forms - the kicking, punching, cutting, slapping, whipping and degrading made their feelings towards me pretty clear.
It all started when I was around 5 years, when they first hit me. It started with a mere slap and then slowly progressed to full - fledged beatings by the time I was 8. They loved it when I begged them to stop , so I stopped begging. They loved it when I used to cry, it gave them relief to finally see me break, so I stopped crying. I haven't cried since I was 10.
I haven't told anyone about the abuse as it is of no use. No one cares enough to help me. I once tried to tell someone and it turned out to be the day I got the worst beating as the person I went for help turned out to be my parents friend. Since then I stopped trying to get help.
I don't burden anyone with my problems as I know it will be useless and all I'll get in return is pity. And if there is anything I hate more than anything in this world is pity and sympathy. I don't anyone to pity me or feel bad for me.
I always dreamed of having a perfect and loving family, where my father would love me and play with me, my mother and I would be cooking together, where I would have siblings who would be my partner in crime and always support me, but that always remained a dream no matter how much I wanted it to be my reality.
It is currently 3:00 in the morning and I am wide awake. I have insomnia and have trouble sleeping. I would be lucky to get even 3 hours of sleep. I am currently in my room which consists of a very old and torn mattress, some of my clothes and some other stuff in the corner and a very thin blanket.
I make my way towards the bathroom and lift up my shirt to check the damage done yesterday. I sigh when I see my multi- colored torso and multiple fresh cuts and bruises. I remove my clothes for a shower and make my way inside. I turn on the faucet and ice cold water starts pouring out as I am not allowed to use hot water. I quickly take a shower and start dressing and sanitizing my wounds.
I learned the basics of first - aid from books so I can at least prevent any infection to spread in my body due to my wounds. After covering all my wounds properly, I make my way down towards the kitchen to make breakfast for them. I take some eggs and start preparing the bacon.
After I am done preparing breakfast , I wait for them to come downstairs. After sometime I hear some footsteps and prepare myself for what is about to come. My parents come and sit on the table and start eating the breakfast. I am not allowed to eat without their permission so I just keep standing in the corner while they eat. I have some rules which I have to follow or else I get punished , so to avoid any punishment as I am still in pain from yesterday, I keep my head low and stand there.
After breakfast , they make their way towards me and I already know what is about to come , so I mentally prepare myself. My father slaps me and then starts kicking me after throwing me on the floor. My mother joins in and says ""What is is shit that you are feeding us, you fucking bitch??""
I remain quiet and it looks like they didn't like my answer so they start kicking me harder. This goes on for another 30 minutes after which they finally stop.
""That is what you get for feeding us this crap and ignoring us you slut"" my father Jack spat.
""Now listen clearly, we are moving to New York so you better pack your filthy stuff within an hour. If you are not ready within an hour, there will be consequences, so you better listen. Leave now, we have much more important things to do than see your ugly face."" my mother Nancy snarled.
With the support of the wall, I stood up and made my way towards my room. After I reached my room, I took out my supply of painkillers that I had and took 2 from them. I know it is dangerous to take painkillers without a prescription or adult supervision, but I have no choice. I need a way to deal with the pain, so I have some painkillers and some sleeping pills for when it is very much required.
I was able to afford these and some basic first aid materials using the money that I earn by working in a café nearby. A very nice lady owns it and hired me after she saw that I was desperate for some money. My parents don't know that I earn or else they will take all my salary for buying their own alcohol and drugs. I have been saving some money for 4 years so that when I turn 18, I can leave this hellhole and start a new life somewhere away from them.
After I was done packing, I made my way downstairs. A few minutes later, they also came and we sat in the car they owned and started our journey to New York, as we lived only a few hours away from the city.
After about 6 hours, we reached a rundown house in a very shady neighborhood. After parking the car, we made our way inside.
""Go to the basement bitch, that will be where you are staying. This house only has two rooms and you don't deserve such a luxury. Get out of my sight now"" Nancy said sternly.
As I was making my way towards the basement, I was only thinking one thought -
'Let us see how this goes'


Book #01:Chapter 2



KEIRA'S POV
It is the next week, nothing really happened last week except getting a beating everyday. Today is the day I am starting my new school. It is different from my previous school as it is a prestigious private school that is attended mostly by rich students. I was able to get into this school on a scholarship for which I applied last week and it was my luck that I was accepted.
After getting ready in the school uniform, yes there is a school uniform as they are very particular about the rules, I started making breakfast for my parents. After I was done, knowing I won't be allowed to eat any of it, I left for school.
The school is about 30 minutes away from my house , so I leave 40 minutes early as I have to go by foot.
On my way , I have only one thought running in my head,
'I hope it is not like my previous school.'
Why? Because I was basically the loner and the nerd of the school and the popular kids never failed to bully me.
After I reach the school, I realize I am 10 minutes early.
'Well there is nothing wrong with coming early. Better be early than late.'
I continue my way inside and holy moly it is a gigantic school and very well maintained. Now I know why this is a rich kids school and I really cannot blame their fees now that I have seen it from inside. Good thing I don't have to pay that much, perks of having a scholarship.
'You know you don't really belong here right?' my inner voice taunts.
'Well I don't care , all I care about is that their curriculum is good so that I can study enough to earn and leave when I am 18.' I retorted.
'Whatever , I am sure the bullying here will be worse than last school and you will definitely be a target.' my inner subconscious added.
'Go away Fiona , I don't need you adding on to my nervousness.' I scowled.
After my very amazing chat with my subconscious Fiona , yeah I named her, it was annoying to call her subconscious again and again, I made my way towards the front desk to get my schedule.
When I reached there, I saw a lady there working on the computer. I cleared my throat to get her attention.
""Hi sweety, are you a new student here?"" She said finally looking up.
""Y-yes, can I p-please get my schedule?"" I stuttered nervously.
""Of course dear, what is your name?"" She asked politely.
""K-Keira"" I whispered.
""Ah yes here we have the schedule of Keira Harris. Here honey."" She said giving me my schedule and locker details.
""Thank you"" I smiled and left for my locker.
As I checked my schedule, I saw that my first period was maths.
'It should be made illegal to have math as the first period.'
After a few minutes I saw children making their way towards their respective classes. So , I too went towards my math classroom. As I was new, I was having trouble locating the classroom when I felt something colliding with me.
'Or more like someone'
As I looked up, I saw a beautiful girl the same age as me looking at me.
""Hi, I am Sophia. Are you new here?"" She asked.
""Yes"" I said quietly as this was the first time someone talked to me willingly.
""Well, why don't you show me your schedule and I'll help you reach your class."" Sophia offered.
""Thank you"" I whispered giving her my schedule.
""Oh we have the same class, come on let's go."" She ushered.
As we made our way towards the class, I started getting more and more nervous. Probably sensing my nervousness, Sophia assured, ""Don't worry. I'll help you, no need to be nervous. I'll also introduce you to my friends, even they will be happy to help you.""
Hesitantly, I knocked on the door and entered.
""You are late Miss Sophia and who may you be?"" The teacher asked noticing me.
""I am sorry Mr. Gregory but she is new so I was just helping her."" Sophia said politely.
""Ah, you must be the new student joining us then. Keira Harris am I right?"" Mr. Gregory remarked.
""Y-yes"" I said quietly.
""Alright Miss Harris you can sit beside Sophia then."" He added.
""T-Thank you"" I mumbled and quickly sat down on my seat.
After an hour , the class was finally over and everyone left the class quickly not wanting to stay another minute there.
""Hey, why don't you sit with me and my friends at lunch? This way I'll be able to introduce you to everyone?"" Sophia offered.
""A-are you s-sure your friends w-will be okay with me s-sitting with t-them?"" I asked hesitantly.
""Of course, why not."" Sophia remarked.
""OK then"" I smiled.
""Great, see you at lunch then."" Sophia waved.
With that I left for my next class.


Book #01:Chapter 3



DAVIDE'S POV
Gulping down the entire glass of alcohol in my hand, I think of my family. They are my pride and my everything. I can do anything for my family, go to any lengths to keep them safe and happy.
Yet I couldn't keep this promise of safety. Looking down at the picture of my youngest children, I sigh. In the picture I can see three new-born babies all cuddling to each other.
' My boys and my only princess'
Keiraryday I wish for my princess to come back to me, but alas it has been 15 years now just dreaming for it to happen but it hasn't happened.
I can still remember the day my youngest triplets were born as if it was yesterday. When my beautiful wife, Melissa went into labor, we were already informed of having twins. But after Nathan was born, she started feeling contractions again and then we got to know that we were actually going to have triplets and the last baby was actually hiding behind the first two.
My happiness knew no bounds when my daughter was born. Yes, she was a surprise, but the best surprise I ever got. Keiraryone in our family was really happy as a girl was finally born in a family with only boys after generations. We were going to inform all of our children about this surprise the next day, but unfortunately we were never able to.
Our princess was kidnapped after mere hours of her birth. Keiran after all those extensive security measures I took, someone managed to take her from right under our noses. I had no idea on how to inform my children and my nephews that they finally had a sister but at the same time they did not.
' I mean imagine me saying that.'
Keiran after looking for her, we came up with nothing. So to prevent the children from experiencing the pain of being separated from their only sister, we decided not to tell them. As we were informed of only having twins, and our princess was a surprise to us, we did not have to do much to convince them.
To this date, my sons except my oldest- Stefano, do not know that they have a sister. It pains me everyday that I have to keep this huge secret from them, but it is for their own good as I can't see my children broken.
When my eldest son took my place as the Mafia Don, I had to tell him so that he could continue to search for her. His reaction to this date is embedded in my brain. I had never seen Ales so broken. He usually doesn't show his emotions to anyone but that day even he couldn't control himself and broke down.
After that Ales continued the search for his baby sister but even then we were not able to find her. I feel the most guilty to hide this from Jason and Nathan as they have a right to know about their own triplet but the father in me is unable to knowing the consequences of what will happen when they get to know about her. I can see my wife missing our daughter everyday but she covers it up with a smile and just continues being an excellent mother to all our kids.
' I miss you princess. Come back to us'
Dismissing all of these thoughts, I make my way downstairs for breakfast. We always have breakfast and dinner as a family as during lunch we are all at different places.
While drinking my coffee, I notice that my youngest son- Nathan is not yet at the table.
""Where is Nathan?"" I question.
""He is still getting ready even after I woke him up 40 minutes ago."" Carlos rolled his eyes.
""I am here, I am here."" Nathan came shouting.
""And may I ask why are you late even after waking up early?"" Melissa glared with her hands on her hips.
""No no you may not."" Nathan sassed.
Keiraryone stifled a laugh at that making Melissa glare at them.
""Stop this sassy attitude of yours right now young man and settle down for breakfast quickly. You are already late."" Melissa reprimanded Nathan.
Nathan just gave a sheepish smile and settled down filling his plate with everything.
'This boy can eat anything and everything.'
Seeing his plate, Jason questioned in disbelief, ""And you are going to be eating all that?""
Nathan just gave him a glare and did not answer resulting in Jason rolling his eyes.
'This boy never fails to amaze me with his goofiness.'
Seeing my whole family eating breakfast together, I couldn't help but imagine the moment when my daughter will also be seated at this table enjoying with us. That thought brought a smile to my face.
""Why are you smiling like a creep dad ?"" Xavier narrowed his eyes probably catching onto my smile.
""Nothing, finish your breakfast quickly and leave for school."" I diverted the topic.
After everyone's breakfast was done, everyone made their way to their respective places. Getting into my car,  I prepared myself for the day ahead.
'If only I knew my wish was going to come true in some days.'

After attending three more classes, it was finally lunch time and I was still debating whether I should sit with Sophia and her friends or just go somewhere other than the cafeteria to avoid everyone.
' You should just go and hide somewhere, I really don't want to attract bullies. ' Fiona advised.
'Maybe you are right. Moreover today everyone just kept staring at me like they saw a ghost. I shouldn't attract more attention.' I sighed.
'But we are not cowards, I changed my decision, let's go and meet some new people. Maybe they are actually nice and won't bully us ?' my inner voice declared.
'Fine , but if I feel uncomfortable, I am going to leave.' I negotiated.
'I agree. NOW LET'S GO AND KICK SOME ASS !!!' Fiona yelled.
'Geez, don't shout. I am going.' I remarked.
'Let's hope nothing goes wrong now' with that thought in my mind I entered the cafeteria.
As soon as I entered inside, everyone turned towards me.
'I know I am beautiful but no need to stare. Poor fans can't get enough attention.' Fiona gushed.
Ignoring my inner voice, I took a look towards everyone to find Sophia.
""Keira here"" Sophia shouted from a table at the corner and called me towards her.
Making my way towards her, I noticed 4 boys and 1 girl other than Sophia sitting there.
""Guys, this is our new friend, Keira. She is new here."" Sophia introduced me.
""Keira these are my friends - Maeve, Clive, Brandon, Aidan and Javier."" Sophia said pointing to each one of them.
""Hey"" they all chorused.
""Hi"" I muttered shyly.
They all chuckled and motioned for me to sit with them.
""So where are you from?"" Aidan asked.
""Umm, I-I used to l-live about 6 hours f-from here in a small t-town. I came here last w-week only."" I explained.
""Oh ok, why did you shift in the middle of the term though?"" Maeve inquired.
""My parents got a new job so we shifted."" I replied lowly not wanting to discuss this topic further.
Catching onto my nervousness regarding this topic, they changed the subject.
""Do you think I could fit 20 marshmallows in my mouth?"" Javier suddenly asked frowning.
Keiraryone looked at him in horror.
""Are you sure you are okay bro?"" Brandon asked skeptically.
""Yes"" Javier rolled his eyes.
""Oh ok just checking to be sure."" Brandon replied.
Keiraryone chuckled at that including me while Javier frowned.
""Javier is a big foodie. Like he will literally do anything for food."" Aidan informed me.
""He can literally die for food."" Sophia chuckled.
""Food is his first love."" Brandon said kissing his food.
""Don't make the mistake of ever taking his food or he won't leave you till you get him 10 times more food than you took."" Clive teased Javier.
""Oh shut up guys, he loves food, so what ? Stop teasing the poor guy."" Maeve stated.
""See ! Only Maeve loves me. I hate you guys. But love you Maeve, my savior from these bullies."" Javier said dramatically falling backwards on his chair.
""Of course she will support her boyfriend guys. What did we even expect."" Clive grumbled playfully glaring at the duo.
'What??'
Probably sensing my confusion, Sophia said, ""Oh yeah, Javier and Maeve are dating. So are me and Brandon. And Clive and Aidan are gay and dating too.""
""So basically you are the only one single in our group now, hence we need to find you a nice boyfriend soon."" Aidan smirked which caused me to blush.
""Hang on maybe she already has one. Do you Keira ?"" Maeve added.
""N-no, I d-don't."" I said flustered.
""Aw it's ok. We are still there for you."" Javier cheered.
Just then we heard the cafeteria doors opening and a group of boys made their way towards the big center table.
""They are the Moretti brothers. Stay away from them. They basically own this school. I wouldn't want to get in trouble with them."" Clive warned.
Making a mental note to never come across them, I nodded.
After the break was over, I had the same class as Brandon, Sophia and Clive. As I had to get my stuff from the locker, I went towards it whereas everyone else left for class.
I tried to reach my locker
key word tried...
But before I could, someone pushed me down making me fall.
Gazing upwards to see who did it; I saw a short, slim girl with tons of makeup on her face, high heels and a short skirt with the upper buttons of her shirt undone making her boobs show. There were two more girls behind her and some other students had also stopped to watch the drama which was definitely going to unfold.
""Look who is it, the new girl."" she snickered.
I lowered my gaze to the ground not wanting any trouble.
""Hey why are you quiet? Are you mute?"" another girl rudely exclaimed.
When I still didn't answer, the first girl spoke, ""Listen here and listen clear, I am Brenda and I am the most popular girl of this school and everyone listens to me. So you better obey me and stay out of my way, or there will be consequences. Am I clear ?"" Brenda threatened.
I just nodded my head wanting this to be over already.
""Look up and say it"" she demanded.
I looked up and they all gasped loudly. I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion but still quietly murmured a yes. They still hadn't removed their gaze from my face and kept staring at me like they had seen a ghost.
""H-how do y-you l-look j-just like t-them?"" one of the other girls stuttered in disbelief.
Not understanding anything, I left from there and made my way towards the classroom but could still hear the students in the corridor whispering and murmuring quietly.
Shrugging off my suspicions, I entered the classroom.
'If only I knew how much this one class was going to change my life.'


Book #01:Chapter 5



Jason'S POV
As usual me and my brothers made our way inside the school. And lo and behold ladies and gentlemen, like always all the girls were drooling at us lustfully and all the boys were looking at us with envy. Just that thought itself made me smirk.
I don't speak or express myself much. I have no idea why but it is just hard for me unlike my twin brother to socialize with everyone easily.
'Nathan can literally talk to anyone for hours non-stop even if they have just met.'
As we got inside, we separated and went towards each of our classes. I had Biology as first period so after muttering a lot of curses under my breath, I made my way towards the biology classroom.
After continuous torture that lasted for hours, we finally had our break.
'Phew! At last I can get away from Mrs. Lenington and her heartbreak stories which she tells us instead of teaching like she should. Teachers, I tell you.'
Getting inside the cafeteria, everyone started staring at us which is quite normal for us due to us being Morettis. Taking my seat, I started eating as I was really hungry and that is when I also noticed that I was not the only one hungry, but my twin was hungry too. Just by taking a look at his plate you could figure out that he was starving, but then again he is Nathan.
Shaking my head at that thought, I continued eating.
""Did you hear about the new girl who just joined ?"" Our friend Noah asked.
""And I heard she got here on a scholarship."" he continued.
""Why does it matter if we have a new student ? Why are we even discussing her ? She could be like Brenda for all we know."" Xander rolled his eyes.
All of us scrunched our faces at the mention of Brenda's name. She is the fakest person I have ever met and just does not know how to take a hint. All of us have rejected her multiple times but she still comes to our table to flirt with us every time.
'And the worst part is that she flirts with all of us.'
And would you look at that, think of the devil and the devil shall appear. Brenda made her towards us making us all groan knowing what was about to come.
""Hey boys"" she purred.
'yeah, like literally purred. What is she? A cat ?'
We all just continued eating not really paying attention to her which caused her to throw a tantrum.
Huffing, she stomped away from our table.
""Oh thank you dear God for making the Satan incarnation go away!"" Matteo exclaimed dramatically.
""God, when will she finally take a hint? I mean come on she literally gets ignored everyday and yet still comes here."" Xavier said throwing his hands.
""It's almost like she has no self-respect."" Nathan shook his head.
'almost?'
All of us chuckled at that. Finally finishing with our food, me and Nathan went towards history class. Reaching inside, we took our regular seats that no one dares to sit in.
After the bell, our teacher, Mr. Brown came in and started taking our roll - calls.
Just then, a girl knocked at the door and entered.
'Never saw that girl. Hmm she must be the new girl then.'
""Yes?"" Mr. Brown questioned.
""I-I am new and t-this is my f-first day."" The girl said lowly.
""Oh you must be Miss Harris then. Come in."" Mr. Brown acknowledged.
""Why don't you introduce yourself then."" Mr. Brown said after she came inside.
""Umm, m-my name is K-Keira H-Harris and I-I just shifted t-to New York."" She stuttered nervously keeping her head low and fiddling with her fingers.
Many students snickered at this yet many held sympathy for her.
""What about your hobbies or something else you would like to share?"" Mr. Brown further inquired.
""I l-like to read and draw."" Keira muttered shyly and finally looked up.
When she did, we could hear gasps all across the room. I was busy doodling in my copy, so I too looked up to see the fuss behind this abrupt silence after their huge gasps.
And just as I did, I felt my world stop. Like I literally froze when I saw her face. My eyes widened and I gaped at her.
She had the same eyes as me and Nathan. Same face Same hair Same nose Same lips
Like she was literally a copy of both Nathan and I, just in a female version. I could see from the corner of my eyes that Nathan was frozen like me too. He couldn't believe the resemblance either. Keiraryone else in the class was also shocked.
The only person who didn't know what was going on was the girl in question herself.
""Why don't you take a seat then?"" Mr. Brown finally said clearing his throat.
She nodded and went to sit beside Clive.
' why is she sitting with a boy? '  my inner subconscious scowled glaring at that boy.
'Whoa! Hang on why do we care ? She can do anything she wants.' I retorted.
'shut up. I just don't like her sitting next to a boy.' my inner subconscious gritted.
Tuning it off, I tried to get my mind off of her and focus on what the teacher was saying.
Finally after an hour the class was over and we were able to get out. Nathan and I left the classroom and continued walking in silence thinking of what happened in the class.
""Why did she look like us?"" Nathan asked finally breaking the silence.
""I don't know man. I keep on thinking that too."" I sighed.
""Maybe it is just a huge coincidence. Yeah, a coincidence."" Nathan reassured nodding to himself.
Thinking the same, we went to our next class.
Finally after the day was over and we headed home.
""How was school today boys?"" Mom asked us when we entered inside.
All of us just shrugged as usual making her roll her eyes. Nathan and I shared a look at the question wondering if we should say anything about the girl or not but decided to not say anything yet.
I went to my room and tried to busy myself with something so that I can stop thinking about that girl. But no matter what, she just kept popping into my head again and again.
Sighing, I continued my day ahead.
'If only I knew what was about to come.'",1,1764756399.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

**Chapter** 1 

On the eve of Isabelle Darroch’s wedding to Matteo Norkett, paparazzi caught him hanging out with an intern from his company late at night. 

In a fit of rage, Isabelle bought a plane ticket, trying to get away for a 

bit. 

But when she opened her eyes again, she found herself five years in the future. 

Panicked, she tried calling her parents, only to find that their numbers no longer worked. 

When a message appeared on her computer saying “This identity has been deregistered due to death,” it nearly knocked the wind out of her. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks, dripping onto her phone screen. 

The screen lit up, revealing her wallpaper–a wedding photo of her and Matteo. 

Isabelle finally realized who she could turn to. 

She quickly unlocked her phone and called Matteo. 

She held her breath, counting each “beep” from the receiver. 

Then, a familiar voice came through. “Hello?” 

The worry in Isabelle’s heart suddenly lifted, and all her frustration and confusion spilled out at once. · 

“Honey, something weird just happened… I’m really scared. Can you come get me?” 

After a moment of silence, Matteo calmly replied, “Okay.” 

\*\*\* 

It wasn’t until Isabelle stepped into the familiar office that she finally felt like things were real again. 

She threw herself into Matteo’s arms and cried her heart out. 

After what felt like forever, Matteo frowned and gently pulled her away. 

“Wait, are you saying you traveled through time?” 

Isabelle nodded quickly, but Matteo let out a cold sneer. 

“You really think I’m going to buy that? Five years ago, you never showed up at our wedding, and now, you come up with this ridiculous story.” 

“You don’t believe me?” 

Just a few days ago, they had taken their wedding photos together. But right now, the guy in front of her felt completely unfamiliar. 

“How can I believe any of this?

“What about you? Did you even try to look for me these past five years?” 

Matteo didn’t reply, just giving her a cold stare. 

Just then, a soft voice sounded as the door creaked open. 

“Honey, I brought you some coffee…” 

Isabelle froze, and the blood in her veins seemed to have turned to ice.

Hi, 

I just got out of a relationship where my partner didn't want oral sex, and I really missed it since I am a giver and loved giving oral in precious relationships. 
So now that I’m free, I want to make up for it. 

I’m looking to meet women who enjoys receiving oral and share an intense, mémorable, and a little crazy moment. 
 
I’m just looking to give. I'm not expecting anything in return; I'm really excited at the idea of giving attention and pleasure to a woman. 

If that’s a little wild, I’m also interested in experiencing cuddling with a stranger, simple moments without complications. 

Let's start our meeting with coffee, and see where it goes?

1pd0b2z,https://linktr.ee/universityexploitsbyjx,"The TOEFL Mastery Blueprint: Your Protocol for Ivy League Admissions, 110+ Scores & Academic Fluency","**The Premise: The Gold Standard of Academic Readiness.**  
Securing a high score on the TOEFL iBT (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is not merely a bureaucratic hurdle for your visa application; it is the definitive signal that you possess the cognitive stamina to survive in a high-pressure English-speaking academic environment. It is the non-negotiable gateway between ""conversational fluency"" and the ability to synthesize complex arguments in graduate-level seminars.

Treating this exam like a high school vocabulary quiz—rote memorization of ""SAT words"" and generic templates—is how intelligent candidates end up with a score of 88, a ""Conditional Acceptance"" letter, and remedial ESL classes. The winning approach is to reverse-engineer ETS (Educational Testing Service) scoring rubrics: deconstruct the logic of academic lectures, master the synthesis of reading and listening, and pressure-test your output until speaking grammatically complex sentences is an instinct, not a calculation.

**At a glance (Core Components):**

* **The Input Domains:** Reading (Inference & Rhetorical Function) and Listening (identifying the ""Signal Words"" in 5-minute academic lectures).
* **The Synthesis:** The critical skill of combining sources. You read a passage on Biology, listen to a professor contradict it, and you must explain the relationship. This is the heart of the exam.
* **The ""Compiler"" (Speaking & Writing):** Your output mechanism. It doesn't matter if you understand the lecture if you cannot articulate the summary within 60 seconds with proper intonation and transitional phrasing.
* **Endurance Strategy:** Your systematic process for maintaining peak focus for 3+ hours, eliminating ""distractor"" answers, and managing the clock during the Writing section.

You leverage this validated competency to secure scholarships, gain admission to top-tier universities (Harvard/Stanford require 100+), and prove you can handle the workload.

# The Challenge: Four Score-Killing Traps That Derail Smart Applicants

**1. The ""Netflix & Chill"" Fallacy vs. Academic Reality**  
Your experience watching Friends without subtitles proves you understand colloquial slang, but it does not guarantee you can follow a lecture on Art History regarding the restoration of Renaissance frescoes. The TOEFL tests **Academic English**. Relying on ""feeling"" which grammar sounds right is a fatal error. The exam tests formal structure, complex sentence variety, and specific vocabulary tiers that rarely appear in casual conversation.

**2. Template Addiction (The ""Robot"" Void)**  
Memorizing rigid templates (""The lecturer posits that..."") without understanding the prompt is a recipe for a mid-tier score (20-22). The AI raters and human graders at ETS are trained to spot ""canned"" responses. If your template doesn't fit the specific logic of the question, you lose points for ""Topic Development."" You must learn **functional frameworks**, not rigid scripts.

**3. The ""Passive Listener"" Syndrome**  
Listening to a podcast while cooking is passive. The TOEFL requires **Active Structural Listening**. You must identify the Professor’s stance, the counter-argument, and the examples provided. If you cannot take notes that visually map the lecture’s structure (Theory → Example → Exception) in real-time, you will fail the Integrated Speaking and Writing tasks.

**4. The ""Vocab Hoarder""**  
Memorizing the top 5,000 GRE words creates a false sense of security. Knowing the word ""antediluvian"" is useless if you cannot use a simple ""Past Perfect"" tense correctly during the Speaking section. High scores come from **precision and flow**, not from forcing obscure words into sentences where they don't belong.

# The High-Pass Protocol: A System for Peak Exam-Day Performance

**Phase 1 — Diagnostic Baseline & Strategic Planning**  
Objective: Eliminate arrogance; align prep to the Official Guide.

* **Define Your Target Contract:**
   * **90+:** State Schools / General Admission.
   * **100+:** Top 50 Universities / Competitive Master’s Programs.
   * **110+:** Ivy League / MBA / TA positions / Law School.
* **Execute a Diagnostic:** Take a full, timed **TOEFL Practice Online (TPO)** test from an authorized provider. Do not pause. Find your ""Red Zones."" Most students are strong in Reading but weak in Speaking/Writing (Production).
* **Scoring Rubric Deep Dive:** Read the ETS official rubrics for Speaking and Writing. Understand what a ""4.0"" (Good) looks like versus a ""3.0"" (Fair).

**Phase 2 — Domain Mastery & Skill Isolation**  
Isolate → Master → Build.

* **Note-Taking Boot Camp:** Spend the first week creating your own shorthand. You cannot write everything. You need symbols for ""increases"" (↑), ""causes"" (→), and ""however"" (≠).
* **Concept Drills:**
   * Reading: Practice ""Sentence Simplification"" and ""Insert Text"" questions. These rely on logic, not just vocab.
   * Listening: Listen to Scientific American or TED-Ed. After 3 minutes, pause and verbally summarize the main point in 15 seconds.
   * Speaking: Record yourself. Listen to the playback. If you say ""Umm"" or ""Uhh"" more than twice, re-record.
* **Writing Protocol:** Master the **Integrated Essay**. This is formulaic. Introduction (Topic) → Body 1 (Reading point + Listening refutation) → Body 2 → Body 3. Speed typing is a required skill; aim for 300 words in 20 minutes.

**Phase 3 — Full-Spectrum Simulation & Stamina**

* **The Endurance Gauntlet:** The TOEFL is a marathon. Your brain will tire by the Writing section (the last section). Train yourself to write high-quality essays while mentally exhausted.
* **Weekly Full-Length Mocks:** 4 weeks out, take one full test every weekend.
* **Advanced Error Analysis:**
   * Vocabulary Gap: ""I didn't know the word 'metabolism'."" (Fix: Add to Anki deck).
   * Logic Error: ""I missed that the professor was being sarcastic."" (Fix: Study 'Attitude/Stance' questions).

# Your Resource Trinity (Quality over Quantity)

**1. Official Docs (The Canon)**

* **The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT (ETS):** The source of truth.
* **Official TOEFL iBT Tests (Vol 1 & 2):** Real past exams. Nothing mimics the actual test difficulty like ETS material.

**2. Focused Tooling (The Toolkit)**

* **Video Courses (Pick ONE):**
   * **GregMat:** The gold standard for affordable, high-level strategy (originally GRE, now excellent for TOEFL).
   * **TST Prep (Josh MacPherson):** Incredible breakdown of Speaking/Writing templates and emergency tactics.
   * **Notefull:** Great for students stuck at the 23-24 point barrier in Speaking.
* **Practice Platform:** **TOEFL Bank** or **TestGlider** (for AI grading estimates), though TPOs are superior.

**3. Targeted Communities (The Forge)**

* **Reddit:** r/Toefl, r/EnglishLearning — Hubs for recent exam trends and speaking partners.
* **Discord:** Join a ""Study Abroad"" server to find a Speaking Partner. You need to practice with humans, not just mirrors.

# 12-Week Accelerator (100+ Score Roadmap)

Assumes 10-15 hours of study per week.

* **Weeks 1-2 — The Foundation:** Grammar refresh. High-frequency academic vocabulary (AWL - Academic Word List). Understanding the 10 Reading question types.
* **Weeks 3-6 — The Input (Reading/Listening):** Do one reading passage and one lecture daily. Focus on why the wrong answers are wrong (Distractors).
* **Weeks 7-9 — The Output (Speaking/Writing):** This is where scores die. Record 5 speaking responses a day. Write 2 essays a week. Focus on transitions (""Furthermore,"" ""Conversely,"" ""Consequently"").
* **Weeks 10-11 — The Pressure Test:** Full timed TPO exams. Simulate the noise of a test center (play coffee shop sounds in the background).
* **Week 12 — Peak & Taper:** Review your note-taking symbols. Light practice. Sleep. Stop studying 24 hours before the exam.

# Why This System Works

* **Prioritizes Synthesis:** It forces you to connect Reading and Listening, which is 50% of the exam's unique difficulty.
* **Builds ""fluency reflexes"":** By recording and criticizing your own voice, you eliminate hesitations that kill your Speaking score.
* **The ""Logic"" over ""English"":** It recognizes that TOEFL is an IQ and Logic test wrapped in English.

# Quick Start Checklist (Do These Tonight)

1. **Register:** Book your exam date 3 months out to create urgency.
2. **Download:** The ""Academic Word List"" (AWL). These 570 word families cover 90% of the academic text you will see.
3. **Purchase:** The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT (latest edition).
4. **Bookmark:** TST Prep’s YouTube channel for free template breakdowns.
5. **Audit:** Record yourself answering: ""What is your favorite book and why?"" If you pause for more than 3 seconds, you have work to do.

# FAQ

**Q: TOEFL vs. IELTS: Which should I pick?**  
**A:** Check your target university requirements first. Generally, TOEFL is preferred by US/Canadian universities (North American Academic English), while IELTS is preferred in the UK/Australia/Europe. TOEFL is 100% computer-based (good if you have bad handwriting); IELTS has a human interviewer for speaking (good if you hate talking to screens).

**Q: Is the Home Edition safe to take?**  
**A:** Use with caution. While convenient, strict proctoring rules (no looking away, no software interference) lead to many horror stories of cancelled scores. If a Test Center is available, it is the safer ""Infrastructure"" choice to avoid technical disqualification.

**Q: Do I need a native accent?**  
**A:** No. ETS graders are trained to understand international accents. However, **Pronunciation** (clarity of sounds) and **Intonation** (stressing the right part of the word) are critical. You must be clear, not American.

**Q: What is a ""good"" score?**  
**A:**

* **Under 80:** Limited options for English-taught programs.
* **80-90:** Standard for many undergraduate programs.
* **100+:** The ""Safe Zone"" for competitive grad schools.
* **110+:** Elite status.

**Chapter** 1 

On the eve of Isabelle Darroch’s wedding to Matteo Norkett, paparazzi caught him hanging out with an intern from his company late at night. 

In a fit of rage, Isabelle bought a plane ticket, trying to get away for a 

bit. 

But when she opened her eyes again, she found herself five years in the future. 

Panicked, she tried calling her parents, only to find that their numbers no longer worked. 

When a message appeared on her computer saying “This identity has been deregistered due to death,” it nearly knocked the wind out of her. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks, dripping onto her phone screen. 

The screen lit up, revealing her wallpaper–a wedding photo of her and Matteo. 

Isabelle finally realized who she could turn to. 

She quickly unlocked her phone and called Matteo. 

She held her breath, counting each “beep” from the receiver. 

Then, a familiar voice came through. “Hello?” 

The worry in Isabelle’s heart suddenly lifted, and all her frustration and confusion spilled out at once. · 

“Honey, something weird just happened… I’m really scared. Can you come get me?” 

After a moment of silence, Matteo calmly replied, “Okay.” 

\*\*\* 

It wasn’t until Isabelle stepped into the familiar office that she finally felt like things were real again. 

She threw herself into Matteo’s arms and cried her heart out. 

After what felt like forever, Matteo frowned and gently pulled her away. 

“Wait, are you saying you traveled through time?” 

Isabelle nodded quickly, but Matteo let out a cold sneer.

For years I have been experiencing what seems like diabetes symptoms, but I am constantly assured that I in fact do not have diabetes, or even pre-diabetes.

However, I wake up anywhere from 1 (if I'm lucky) to maybe 6 times per night to pee. It's usually a full amount. If I don't get up to pee, I can't sleep. I also pee a lot during the day.

I go to bed at around 8 pm, and drink almost no water at all after around 3pm. When I wake up I usually feel pretty dehydrated, so I drink a lot of water in the mornings. For a while it was bad, and I was drinking more than 2 gallons of water a day. Now I take electrolytes and I'm probably closer to one.

I also get ravenouly hungry. There have been multiple times in my life where I've been fully convinced I had a tapeworm or something because I could just not stop eating.

I also get a lot of fatigue. And fatigue and hunger are usually worse after I eat. One of my darkest moments was when I ate lunch and had to put my head down on the table immediately after and started crying because it was the middle of the day but I was too tired to even sit up, i felt like i was literally starving to death, and wanted to go for a walk but was too tired. And I didn't even want coffee, all I could think of was more food. Most often I crave salt and fat. Like eggs or saltines or cheese. I don't crave sugar a lot, unless I'm really hungry.

I do rely a lot on caffeine though too. I can usually get by on 2 cups of coffee, but not less than that. I try to do one in the morning and one early afternoon, which usually allows me to stay up until around 8 or 9. Otherwise, I end up in bed before sunset.

I have no idea if any of these symptoms are actually connected. But either way, whats going on with me?

It seems like a lot of coffee is wasted before you find the right settings. I end up paying a lot for my cup once I’ve found the right measurements. Above all, once I’ve finally dialed in, I don’t have many beans left. I can buy the same ones again once the bag gets empty, but the roast might be a bit different for example. I’ll have to dial in again and waste more, right? Also, I’d like to try lots of different beans, so the time & beans lost put me off a bit..

It wasn’t a good lie, it was about having had a brief sexual relationship with someone who was still around and that I met for coffee. Nothing ever “happened”, but it was a really bad thing to do, I regret it more than anything in my life, and since then he has withdrawn emotionally. I can tell, and it kills me to know how I ruined what is the love of my life, I really mean that.

My boyfriend is a very unusual man, the brightest and most interesting man I’ve ever known. Very handsome but at the same time with a good heart. He’s from a good family with loving parents, I grew up in a broken household with a manipulative mum. Not an excuse in any way, but this is to give you context, I never really realized that there were men out there like my boyfriend.

But as I said, he’s so different after this came to the surface, emotionally distant and sad. He has tried to move past this, but struggling. It kills me to see him in pain. For reasons that are too private to mention here, he suffers from some PTSD symptoms, which makes any feeling of betrayal much harder to work around to rebuild trust. 

I have been floating the idea to suggest him that we open this relationship up only for him. I would stay exclusive, but he can get the freedom for some time, so that he feels like he has the mental space. It’s difficult to explain, but I know him quite well by now, and when I mentioned this idea it was as if his whole body finally relaxed.

1pd02c0,https://youtu.be/Ah7J2Q5RRxg,4 Very Scary TRUE Christmas Delivery Driver Horror Stories,"# ""Taken After Four"":

I had just finished my shift at the warehouse—twelve hours of loading trucks for the holiday rush. Christmas was only a few weeks away, and all I could think about on the drive home were the Barbie dolls I’d ordered for my little girl, Emily. She was seven, endlessly energetic, always bouncing between wanting to be a doctor or an astronaut. My wife, Lisa, stayed home with our toddler, and Emily usually hopped off the school bus a little after four.

I pulled into our gravel driveway just past five. The house sat back from the road, quiet and tucked between winter-bare fields. I expected to see Emily’s pink jacket tossed somewhere by the porch like always.

Instead, Lisa opened the door before I even reached it. Her face was drained of color.

“Emily’s not here,” she said. “I looked everywhere inside. She came home from school, we had a little fight about homework, and she went to her room. When I checked later… she was gone.”

I froze, lunchbox still in my hand.  
“Gone? What do you mean gone? Did she go play outside? Check the barn?”

“I called for her. I searched the yard. Her backpack’s still in her room.”

We walked the property together—the shed where she liked to hide, the old swing set, the barn that creaked whenever the wind shifted. The sun was sinking low, draining color out of everything.

“Emily! Sweetheart!” I shouted, voice cracking across the field.

Nothing.

As we headed back toward the house, Lisa spoke again, almost reluctantly.  
“Remember the delivery guy? FedEx came earlier. Dropped off a package—the dolls, I think. He handed it to me at the door.”

“Did Emily see him?”

“She was in her room. But maybe she came out after.”

I opened the package just to confirm. Inside, the Barbie set—“You Can Be Anything.” Emily had circled that one in the catalog weeks ago. The sight of it turned my stomach.

We called every parent we knew. No one had seen her.

By six, I was on the phone with the sheriff’s office. “My daughter is missing,” I said. “Seven years old, brown hair, pink jacket.”

Deputies arrived in minutes, lights strobing against our windows. Officer Ramirez, tall with a heavy mustache, listened carefully to everything we told him.

“We’ll put out an alert immediately,” he said. “Let’s start searching again.”

Flashlights cut across the property. Deputies called her name, their voices growing more strained as time dragged on. Neighbors showed up with lanterns and coffee. The quiet felt wrong—like the whole world was holding its breath.

By midnight, the living room had become a command post. Sheriff Akin arrived, calm but serious.

“We need every detail,” he said. “Especially about that delivery driver.”

Lisa described him—mid-thirties, dark hair, average build, FedEx jacket. Nothing unusual, nothing memorable. And somehow that felt worse.

No one slept. Lisa sat shaking beside me on the couch.

“What if she fell? What if she’s hurt somewhere?”  
“We’ll find her,” I told her. But doubt was starting to gnaw at me from the inside.

At sunrise, investigators arrived. They questioned us separately, methodically. Then, finally—a lead.

“We contacted FedEx,” Sheriff Akin announced, gathering us in the kitchen. “The driver on your route is Tom Harris. Contract worker. We’re bringing him in now.”

My chest tightened. The man who delivered her Christmas gift… could he have seen her walk outside? Followed her? Taken her?

Lisa’s breath hitched. “You think he—?”

“We just need to talk to him,” the sheriff said.

Hours crawled by. Every second without Emily was another weight added to my chest.

Around noon, the phone rang.  
“Mr. Strand? We have Harris in custody,” a detective said. “He’s talking.”

Lisa and I drove to the station in silence. Sheriff Akin met us in a small room, expression heavy.

“He confessed,” he said quietly. “But it’s… it’s bad.”

My whole body went still.  
“What happened?”

“After delivering the package, he backed up the truck and accidentally hit Emily. Barely clipped her, he says. She wasn’t seriously hurt. She stood up. But he panicked. He put her in the truck.”

Lisa’s hand covered her mouth.

“He said she told him she’d tell you about the accident. He… he strangled her to keep her quiet.”

The words shattered something inside me.

“Where is she?” I whispered.

“He led us to her body. Creek bed about ten miles out, near Boyd.”

Lisa collapsed into sobs. I wrapped my arms around her, but inside, all I felt was a hollow, burning rage. The man who delivered her Christmas present—the box sitting unopened on our table—had taken her life.

They let us see Harris through the glass of an interrogation room. He was slumped forward, handcuffed, eyes empty. Not remorseful. Not frightened. Just… vacant.

“Why?” I asked the sheriff, voice barely audible.  
He shook his head. “He says he didn’t mean to. But he made every choice that followed.”

The days that followed blurred into a fog. Funeral arrangements. Reporters. Pink flowers everywhere—her favorite. The Barbie set placed beside the casket.

At a press conference, Emily’s mother—my ex-wife, Karen—held up the Barbie box.  
“This was supposed to be her Christmas joy,” she said. “Instead, a monster stole her from us.”

We pushed for stricter checks on contract delivery workers. But nothing—no policy, no apology, no lawsuit—could bring her back.

The trial dragged on for months. Evidence was overwhelming. Camera footage showed Emily stepping toward the truck, trusting him. Harris tried to break her neck first; when he failed, he used his hands.

I testified, voice breaking. “She hugged me that morning. Told me she couldn’t wait for Santa.”

Harris showed no emotion. Not a flicker.

The night before the verdict, I drove to the creek where they found her. The water murmured softly, completely indifferent.  
“I’m sorry, baby girl,” I whispered. “Daddy loves you.”

When the jury convicted him, the courtroom felt silent, almost disappointed. Life or death—none of it mattered. Justice couldn’t fill the hollow space left behind.

Years later, I still check every lock twice. Every delivery truck makes my chest tighten.

Because once, a man in uniform came to our door carrying a package—and left carrying my daughter.

Emily could have been anything. Now she is a memory I guard fiercely, a ghost in pink sneakers, reminding me that evil doesn’t always knock loudly. Sometimes it smiles, hands you a box, and walks away with your world.





# ""The Flickering Light"":

I started my shift that afternoon the same way I always did—rolling open the metal door of the delivery van, the warehouse lights buzzing overhead, the air thick with cardboard dust and the smell of diesel. Mid-December in South Florida meant the heat hadn’t completely backed off, so sweat gathered on my forehead before I even left the loading bay. Everyone was pushing hard for the holiday rush. The aisles were packed, workers shouting over each other, conveyor belts rattling as gifts for strangers shot past in every direction.

I’d been driving for Amazon for two years, mostly running routes around Fort Lauderdale—quiet family neighborhoods, retirees, folks walking their dogs, kids biking home before dinner. Nothing exciting. Nothing dangerous. Just long days, long miles, and one package after another. I didn’t mind it. Extra hours meant extra money, and extra money meant better presents for my wife and kids. Christmas was close, and that alone kept me moving.

The dispatcher handed me a thick stack of stops—more than usual. “Busy night,” he muttered, rubbing his temples. “Watch the traffic. People are out of their damn minds this week.”

“Got it,” I said, tucking the scanner into my vest. I climbed into the van, the seat creaking under me, and fired up the engine. The air conditioner struggled for a second before kicking in. Then I hit the road, weaving through streets lined with palm trees that shimmered under the streetlights.

For hours, everything was routine. Park. Drop off a box. Scan. Snap a photo. Back into the van. Repeat. The kind of monotony that makes your brain drift—thinking about what my daughter wanted for Christmas, thinking about how tired my wife must be chasing the kids all day, thinking about how good it would feel to finally get home.

By the time I reached my last few stops, the sky had gone deep purple. Most houses had their Christmas lights on, twinkling across manicured lawns. My next stop was on Northwest 10th Terrace—a darker, quieter side road with long stretches between homes and plenty of shadows where the streetlamps didn’t quite reach.

When I turned in, the van suddenly jerked hard to the right. At first, I thought I hit something, but then came the sickening, rhythmic flapping sound—rubber slapping pavement. Flat tire.

“Perfect,” I muttered.

I pulled over beneath a streetlamp that flickered like it couldn’t decide whether to stay alive or die. It wasn’t my first flat tire. I’d changed plenty on the job. I grabbed the tools from the back, knelt by the wheel, and started loosening the lug nuts.

That’s when I saw him.

A figure crossing the street toward me. Average height. Dark clothes. Hood up. Hands buried in his pockets. He didn’t look drunk. Didn’t look lost. He moved with this steady, controlled stride—like he already knew exactly where he was going. Exactly what he wanted.

“You need help?” he asked.

His voice was wrong. Too calm. Too empty. No concern in it. No curiosity. Just… flat.

I looked up. “No, thanks. I’m good.”

He didn’t stop walking. Not even a pause. Before I could stand fully, he reached into his pocket and pulled out something small and black.

Stun gun.

It crackled to life, a burst of sparks lighting his face for half a second.

Then he pressed it into my ribs.

Electricity tore through me like my entire body was being ripped apart from the inside. My muscles seized, locking up so hard I couldn’t even scream. The lug wrench slipped from my fingers, clattering against the pavement. My breath caught in my throat, and I collapsed sideways, trying to understand what was happening.

“Why—?” I gasped.

“Give me the keys,” he said.

Not angry. Not desperate. Just cold. Robotic.

Before I could respond, he shocked me again—this time on my arm. The pain was so raw I nearly vomited. I fell to my knees, vision swimming. My body felt like it was short-circuiting from the inside out.

He reached into my pocket and yanked out the key fob.

Then he pulled the knife.

The blade glinted under the flickering streetlamp—a brief flash of silver, like a warning I couldn’t comprehend fast enough.

Everything in me froze.

“This isn’t just a robbery,” I whispered.

He lunged.

The first slash tore across my shoulder, fire spreading down my arm as blood soaked through my uniform. I stumbled back, hands raised. “Take the van!” I yelled. “Just take it!”

But he wasn’t listening.

He stabbed again, this time in my side—deep. I felt the blade punch through skin, muscle, something vital. The air left my lungs in a choking gasp. I grabbed his wrist, fighting back with everything I had. We fell sideways, hitting the pavement hard. My vision tunneled, heartbeat roaring in my ears.

This guy didn’t want the van.

He wanted me.

My hand scraped the ground until I felt the metal of the lug wrench. I wrapped my fingers around it and swung blindly, cracking it against his knee. He let out a grunt—more irritated than hurt—and loosened his grip just enough.

I shoved him off and staggered to my feet, blood running warm down my torso. My legs were shaking, but adrenaline forced me forward. I sprinted toward the nearest house, the porch light glowing like a lifeline.

I pounded on the door. “Help! Help me! Please!”

Nothing.

I hit it harder, practically throwing myself at it.

Still nothing.

Behind me, his footsteps approached—slow, patient, like he knew I wasn’t going anywhere.

“You’re done,” he called, voice drifting across the street.

Terror surged through me. I turned and ran, lungs burning, vision dimming at the edges. I rounded the corner and spotted a small convenience store up ahead. Warm light poured through the windows. People inside.

I pushed my legs harder, even as they started to buckle.

The door slammed open when I crashed into it. I stumbled inside, collapsing against the counter. “Call 911,” I gasped. “He—he stabbed me—”

The clerk’s eyes went wide. “Oh my God—sit down, sit down—”

Two customers rushed over. One grabbed a towel. Another held me upright as I slid down the counter.

“Stay with us, man. Stay awake.”

The world blurred. Spots of light flickered in and out. My chest felt tight, every breath a struggle. Someone shouted that police were on the way. Someone else said my shirt was turning red too fast.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Then everything went dim.

When I woke up in the ambulance, a paramedic leaned over me. “You’ve got seven stab wounds,” he said. “One punctured your lung. We're keeping it inflated. Stay with us.”

I tried to speak, but all I could do was nod weakly.

Later at the hospital, after surgery, after questions, after the long slow return of sensation to my body, the police told me they caught him. Curtis Gardner. Thirty-three. Long record. Violent history. They said he slashed my tire beforehand. That he was waiting.

Waiting for me.

Attempted murder. Armed robbery. Pre-meditated.

Weeks passed. I healed physically, more or less. Scars marked where his knife had entered. But the mental scars… those stayed sharper.

I quit the job. Found something safer. Something that didn’t require stepping into dark neighborhoods with my back turned.

But sometimes, driving home at night, I still see him—the way he walked, the way he didn’t hesitate, the way the stun gun crackled before the world lit up with pain.

And even now, whenever I see a delivery van pulled over on the side of the road under a flickering streetlamp, a chill runs through me.

Because I know how quickly things can go wrong.  
How fragile a life can be.  
How close I came to losing mine on a quiet street just days before Christmas.





# ""Followed Me All Night"":

I had been driving for the food delivery app for about six months when the holiday rush hit full force. Extra orders meant extra money, and with two kids at home, I needed every dollar I could squeeze out of the night. So on Christmas Eve, instead of winding down with my family, I decided to work late. Most people were gathered around living rooms, eating leftovers or unwrapping early gifts—but there were always a few who still wanted their meals delivered hot.

My phone kept buzzing with pickups from diners and fast-food joints that stayed open through the night. I told myself I’d finish by two in the morning, go home, and wrap presents before the kids woke up.

The first few runs were easy. I grabbed a bag of burgers from a drive-thru and dropped them off at an apartment complex. The guy at the door handed me a five and said, “Merry Christmas, man. Stay safe out there.” I smiled, told him the same.

Next was a pizza order to a house at the edge of town. A tired-looking mom answered—hair messy, dark circles under her eyes, but still trying to be polite. “Thank you for coming this late,” she said. “My husband works nights too.” We talked for a minute about how crazy the season was. She tipped well, and for a moment the job felt human, warm.

But as I stepped back into my car, I noticed a sedan parked across the street with its lights off. Two figures sat inside, silhouettes barely moving. I brushed it off—plenty of people sit in cars late at night.

Still, the image stuck in my mind as I drove to my next pickup, a Chinese place downtown. While waiting inside, I called my wife.

“Hey, love,” I said. “Just a couple more orders, then I’m done.”

She sounded uneasy. “Don’t push it too hard tonight. Empty roads freak me out.”

I laughed. “I’ll be fine. Kiss the kids for me.”

But when I got back on the road, my rearview mirror caught something that made my stomach dip. The same sedan from earlier was behind me—same shape, same headlights. I told myself it was coincidence, but when I turned onto a side street toward the next drop-off, the sedan turned too.

The house was quiet, porch light glowing faintly. I left the bag by the door and snapped the proof photo for the app. As I walked back, the sedan rolled slowly past me. The windows were tinted black, impossible to see through. I kept my head down and my pace even, but my pulse was hammering. They didn’t stop—but they wanted me to know they were there.

Inside my car, I locked the doors fast.

Another order popped up—Denny’s, ten minutes away. Good tip promised. I sighed and accepted. That tip would go straight toward the kids’ gifts.

But as I pulled onto the main road, the sedan reappeared in my mirror like it had been waiting. My throat went dry.

I called a friend who also delivered at night. “You out?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Think someone’s following me.”

He didn’t joke, didn’t laugh. “Turn around if you can. Or call the cops. Don’t brush it off, man.”

I hung up with a promise to be careful.

At a red light, I stared into the mirror. The sedan was two cars back. The moment the light changed, I sped up.

I pulled into the Denny’s parking lot—one of the few places still alive this late. Inside, people were scattered around: a family with kids sharing pancakes, two workers on a break, a few night owls. It felt safe in a way the empty streets didn’t.

“Pickup for Johnson,” I told the waitress at the counter.

“Five minutes,” she said with a tired smile.

While I waited, two young guys walked in—hoodies, masks, hands buried in pockets. They didn’t order. They sat near the door, whispering to each other, throwing glances my way. I pretended to scroll on my phone, but every nerve in my body was on high alert.

The waitress handed me the bag. “Drive safe.”

“Thanks,” I said, but my voice felt thin.

Outside, the cold air slapped me awake. My car was only a few steps away. I reached for the handle—

Footsteps. Fast.

I spun around. The two guys from inside were almost on me. One had a baton. The other…something metallic in his hand. A gun? Or a fake? I didn’t have time to figure it out.

“Keys and wallet,” the baton guy growled.

“I—I got family,” I stammered. “Please.”

The one with the gun lifted it, pointing it square at me. “Now.”

My heart hammered so hard I felt it in my throat. The diner door was twenty feet away—if I shouted, maybe someone inside would notice. But they were too close. Too fast.

The baton guy swung. The hit cracked against my arm, white-hot pain exploding up to my shoulder. I dropped the food.

“STOP!” I yelled. “HELP!”

The gun guy grabbed my shirt, yanking me forward. “Shut up.”

Adrenaline made the world narrow to a tunnel. I twisted hard, shoving him back. He stumbled, surprised. That was my only chance. I ran.

The baton slammed across my back, knocking the breath from my lungs. I hit the pavement, skinned my hands, tasted blood.

“Get him!” the gun guy barked.

I scrambled up and threw myself at the diner door, banging with everything I had. Inside, people shot to their feet. The waitress screamed, “CALL 911!”

The attackers froze when they saw everyone watching. And then, as if on cue, faint sirens wailed somewhere in the distance—maybe unrelated, but loud enough to rattle them.

They grabbed my keys off the ground, sprinted to my car, and peeled out of the lot.

I slumped against the door, gasping, my arm throbbing like it was on fire. The manager rushed out.

“Oh my God—are you okay?”

“I—I think so,” I croaked. “They took my car.”

Police showed up minutes later. I gave them everything I could: two teens, dark hoodies, masks, one taller than the other. They found my car abandoned a mile away, emptied of everything but a few old delivery bags.

No arrests that night, but the officers said the description matched a string of robberies.

I spent Christmas in the hospital with a fractured arm, bruised ribs, and a wife who couldn’t stop shaking as she held my hand. The kids climbed into the bed with me, completely unaware how close things had come.

“Never again,” my wife whispered. “No more late nights.”

Even now, months later, I still check my mirrors every time I drive. That night taught me something brutal and simple: danger doesn’t announce itself. One minute you’re earning a little extra for your family. The next, you’re running for your life in an empty parking lot.

And sometimes, the scariest part is how fast everything can change.





# ""The Quad Bike"":

I had been driving for a food delivery app for almost a year, long enough to know that Christmas Day shifts were a gamble. Sometimes they were slow, sometimes they were chaos. But in 2024, with my kids expecting presents I could barely afford, I couldn’t turn down the holiday pay boost. So I clocked in that evening, loaded up my moped, and headed out into the quiet streets of Epsom.

It felt like the whole town had gone still. Houses glowed warm with family gatherings, laughter muffled behind windows, the smell of roasting dinners drifting through the air. The roads, though, were empty—just me, my moped, and the occasional lonely car rolling by.

My first few drops went smoothly. A pizza to a family on a cul-de-sac. Indian food to an older couple who insisted I take a generous tip. “Merry Christmas, mate,” the man said, smiling like he meant it. “Stay safe out there.”

I didn’t realize how much I’d remember those words later.

Around 9 p.m., I picked up an order from a busy little takeaway in town—a small bag heading to a place on Ashley Road. An easy run. I zipped along the path, my moped’s headlight slicing through patches of shadow.

That’s when I saw it.

A quad bike. Parked at an angle at the corner of a quiet street. No lights. Engine low and rumbling. Two figures sat on it, both in black hoodies, faces hidden behind scarves. At first I shrugged it off—teenagers messing around, probably bored on Christmas night. But as I passed, I felt their eyes follow me.

I turned onto Ashley Road, and seconds later, their engine growled to life behind me.

I looked in my mirror.

They were following.

Not close enough to seem obvious, not far enough to be accidental. A steady stalk.

I reached the delivery house—a small place with warm lights glowing through the curtains. I parked, grabbed the bag, and knocked. A woman answered immediately, smiling as though she’d been waiting right behind the door.

“Oh, thank you! We totally forgot to order dinner today.” She handed me a tip wrapped in a Christmas card. “Merry Christmas.”

“Merry Christmas,” I said, trying to sound normal.

But when I stepped back outside, my stomach dropped.

The quad bike had rolled up right behind my moped.

Blocking it.

The two figures stood now—both young, maybe 18 or 19. One had a small mole just under his right lip. It made him look almost innocent, but his eyes were anything but. Cold. Focused. Predatory.

“Hey, you,” the one with the mole called out in a low, sharp voice. “That’s a nice moped. Hand it over.”

I froze, hands instinctively gripping my helmet.

“What? I’m working. This is my bike.”

The second guy stepped forward, cracking his knuckles like he’d been waiting all night for this.

“We said hand it over,” he repeated. “Don’t make us take it.”

My heart hammered. The street was dead quiet. No cars. No people. Just me and two strangers who didn’t care what happened next.

“Look… I don’t want trouble,” I said quietly. “Let me go.”

The one with the mole chuckled—soft, almost amused.

“Trouble? Mate… you’re the one out here alone.”

He lunged and grabbed my arm.

Instinct kicked in. I jerked away and shoved him. Harder than I meant to. He stumbled. I used that half-second to jump onto my moped and slam the key. The engine hesitated—my stomach turned—then finally roared awake.

The second guy swung and clipped my shoulder, sending pain up my neck.

But I tore past them, swerving into the road as they shouted behind me.

I didn’t breathe properly until I was three streets away. Hands shaking, I called support.

“This is driver 4782—I just got attacked on Ashley Road. Two guys on a quad bike tried to steal my moped.”

The operator’s tone changed instantly.

“Oh my God. Are you injured? Stay on the line. We’re alerting the police.”

I pulled over, chest rising and falling too fast. She asked for a description; I gave it—white, late teens, scarves covering most of their faces, one with a mole below his lip.

Then she asked the question that made me hesitate.

“Do you want to end your shift?”

I thought of the bills I still needed to cover.

“No. I’ll finish a couple more.”

I regret those words even now.

My next order was close, just a few blocks over on Epsom Road in Ewell. I convinced myself the danger was behind me.

But the streets on that side felt different—darker, quieter, as if the town itself had stepped away. I kept checking my mirrors, half-expecting to see that quad bike again. Nothing.

The flat above the shop was straightforward. The man answered annoyed, muttered something about delays, grabbed his food, slammed the door.

Whatever—just another delivery.

But when I walked back down the outside stairs, I heard it.

That engine.

Low. Familiar.

My pulse spiked.

The quad bike rolled out of a side alley, lights off, creeping toward me like a predator testing its next move.

“It’s them…” I whispered.

The mole guy pointed at me. “Look who we found again.”

Before I could react, the other guy charged.

“Give us the bike,” he snapped, “or we’ll f\*\*\*ing make you.”

His fist smashed into my ribs. I gasped and staggered back.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, jumping onto my moped.

He grabbed the back metal frame and nearly yanked me off.

I twisted the throttle full blast.

The sudden jolt ripped me out of his grip. I shot down the road, weaving between parked cars as their quad bike roared after me. My lungs burned. My eyes stung. A horn blared as I cut in front of a car.

I lost them only after taking a sharp corner into a side lot behind a closed store. I hid there, engine off, chest heaving.

I called support again. My voice shook.

“It’s me again. They found me. Same guys. Epsom Road. They— they punched me, tried to pull me off.”

The operator’s voice dropped to a whisper, like she didn’t want to scare me.

“Police are on the way. Tell me where you are. Stay hidden.”

So I did.

The minutes stretched. Every sound—every shifting leaf, every car in the distance—made me flinch.

Finally, blue lights washed over the pavement. Two officers approached quickly.

“You the delivery driver?” one asked.

I nodded. “Yes. They attacked me twice. Same guys.”

They exchanged a look.

“You’re not the only one tonight,” the officer said. “Another driver reported two young men on a quad bike trying to take his scooter earlier.”

“That was me,” I said. “The first time.”

The officer blinked. “Again? Jesus. Okay—we’re escalating this.”

I wanted to go home. Every part of me wanted to go home.

But the app buzzed.

Another order had already been assigned to me—High Street, Ewell.

The officers urged me to clock out.

But the customer started calling.

“Where’s my food? We’re waiting.”

Stupidly—stupidly—I accepted. The officers agreed to stay close.

We made our way toward High Street—busier, brighter. People walking here and there. It felt safer.

Until it didn’t.

I parked and grabbed the bag. As I turned toward the address, the quad bike shot into the street like it had been launched. The two men leaped off before it fully stopped.

“Third time’s the charm,” the mole guy sneered. “Bike. Phone. Wallet. Now.”

His friend cracked his knuckles again, smiling like this was all a joke.

“You should’ve stayed home tonight.”

I backed up, voice cracking. “Police are right here. Back off!”

They didn’t care.

The mole guy slammed a fist into my chest. The air left my lungs. I staggered and nearly dropped the bag.

“No one’s saving you,” he whispered.

And then—

Sirens.

Shouting.

“STOP! POLICE!”

The men spun around. For the first time all night, I saw fear in their eyes. They bolted to the quad bike and tore off down the alley before the officers could reach them.

The street fell quiet again.

I leaned on the wall, chest aching, breath ragged.

“You alright?” one officer asked.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just… shaken.”

At the station later, the truth became clearer.

I wasn’t the first driver targeted. Or the second. I was the third—within forty minutes.

Three delivery workers. Same area. Same quad bike. Same faces.

The officers suspected they were local boys, high, bored, armed with enough adrenaline and stupidity to ruin someone’s life.

I quit deliveries a few days later.

Even now, every time I hear an engine rumble outside my window, my body tenses. My hands shake. And every Christmas, I think about those two young men on that quad bike—out there somewhere.

And how close they came to taking everything from me.",1,1764755287.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

A calm home begins with simple, intentional choices. Minimalist decor helps create ease by focusing on what you use and love, rather than filling rooms with extra items. Start by clearing surfaces like coffee tables and counters to open up your space and make cleaning easier. Let natural light flow by keeping windows clear and curtains open, allowing brightness to set a peaceful tone. Choose a small, soothing color palette—soft whites, grays, or warm neutrals—to keep the room visually steady. Keep only purposeful pieces that support your daily routines, and add gentle nature touches such as a single plant or a simple branch in a vase. With small, steady steps, your home becomes a warm and restful place.",1,1764755255.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

1pd0116,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1pd0116/a_girl_i_meet/,A Girl I meet,"Good morning, thank you for reading. I'm a little confused, and after talking with friends, we've come to a conclusion, but I want to hear your point of view. Look, I met a girl at a Catholic retreat in October. she was in my group, and initially she didn't catch my attention, but around noon on Sunday I started to feel something for her. The thing is, I felt it in a way I had never felt before, with a sense of peace, tranquility, and great security, something I had never felt when I liked someone, which was always accompanied by a bit of anxiety and nervousness. The thing is, that same day, at the end of the retreat, we were fooling around with our backpacks, and she wanted us to swap backpacks so that each of us would carry the other's. Shortly after the final mass ended, she left, as she is from a city far away from where the final mass was held. After a couple of days, I texted her and we met up. It went very well. She invited me for coffee without giving me a chance to refuse, and with that excuse I told her we should meet again so I can invite her. She agreed, and two weeks ago we met again and it went well. We said we would set a date to meet again and she said she would pay the next time. That same week we saw each other twice more, as I went to Eucharistic adoration with her. She had to leave early because she had an exam the next day, and I left with her because I didn't know anyone and didn't want to be alone. She offered to walk me to the subway, since she lives near the church, so we went together. When we said goodbye, I don't know why, but I always end up hugging her instead of giving her two kisses, and she had to remind me with a smile. That same week, we saw each other again on Sunday at the barbecue after the retreat. We didn't talk much there, since she was with the friends she made at the retreat and I was with my friends. I don't know why, but I noticed she was different. When she was about to leave, I told her that on Monday she could let me know when it would be convenient for her to meet up, since these weeks at the end of the year are a bit complicated because of college. When she didn't say anything, I texted her on Monday night to ask her. It took her a while to reply. She said that week was complicated for her, and in the end, it was for me too, so we said we'd find another day. The fact is that yesterday I wrote to her saying that I couldn't make it this week after all, and she said no problem. Then I asked her if we could meet before the end of the year, and she still hasn't replied. I told her this at noon. I don't know if she's stringing me along or if it's just me being paranoid, and she's simply busy and that's why she's taking so long to reply.

A friend of a friend that I have met a few times gave birth a few weeks ago. We were all meeting for coffee as a group, and I asked how her dogs were finding having a baby in the house. The new mother looked dead in the eyes and said “oh there’s no way they would have coped so I rehomed them”. What??????

The dogs were already rescues and adopted from bad/abusive situations. They’ve already had to go through a kennel system and then the stress of a new home. And she had them YEARS before meeting her partner or getting pregnant. 

It’s just absolutely wild to me. Even if I wanted kids, if I had any animal that couldn’t be around them for whatever reason, I would wait until that animal had passed. They were in my home first and should be as much of a priority than some pet cum. 

I instantly lost all respect for her. Mutual friends have said I’m over reacting, but I don’t think I am. Imagine if she had put her kid up for adoption to get a pet dog? 

Anyways, I just wanted to rant in a place where people may understand. Thanks for reading! ",17,1764755136.0,childfree,12,1.0,False

1pczwzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1pczwzf/vibe_coding_is_greener_than_human_coding_says_ai/,Vibe Coding is greener than human coding says AI,"Hi folks,

  
Here is my prompt:  
I'm curious about how vibe coding impacts our world in terms of energy consumption. I want you to compare a coding task with ""how much energy would AI use"" versus ""how much energy would human use?"" Analyze it differently for both simple coding changes and larger ones.

When making this comparison, don't think of human energy consumption as simple food consumption. Consider human psychology as well. In other words, people can get tired from thinking about a topic, want to interject other thoughts to continue thinking about it, or want to rest. People also expend energy while resting.

  
This is the answer from Gemini 3 Pro model:



Most debates about the energy cost of AI vs. Humans compare **GPU Watts** against **Human Caloric Burn**. I think this is fundamentally flawed.

When we talk about ""Vibe Coding"" (coding with natural language, focusing on flow rather than syntax), we ignore the massive energy sink of the human condition: **Time and Psychology.**

I ran a rough ""Carbon/Energy Footprint"" comparison, but instead of counting sandwiches, I counted the **""Systemic Overhead""** required to keep a human developer operational.

Here is the breakdown:

# 1. The ""Activation Energy"" Problem (Small Tasks)

**Scenario:** Fixing a Regex bug or changing a button component.

* **🤖 AI Approach:**
   * **Time:** 15 seconds.
   * **Energy:** A momentary burst of GPU usage. Negligible.
* **🧠 Human Approach:**
   * **Time:** 20-40 minutes.
   * **The Hidden Cost:** Humans don't just ""execute."" We need to find the file, load the mental context, get distracted, check Slack, maybe brew coffee, and *then* code.
   * **Energy Bill:** During this 40-minute window, your dual monitors, office HVAC (heating/cooling), and room lighting are running at full capacity.
   * **Winner:** AI. It eliminates the ""startup cost"" of human focus.

# 2. The ""Time Compression"" Math (Large Tasks)

**Scenario:** Refactoring a legacy module.

Let’s look at the Napkin Math.

**Option A: The Human Route**

* **Duration:** 1 Work Week (40 hours).
* **The Systemic Load:** A human developer isn't just a brain; they are a tenant in a building.
   * Laptop + 2 Monitors: \~150W
   * Office Lighting + HVAC share: \~200W (conservative estimate)
   * Total constant draw: 350W
* **Total Energy:** 350W \* 40 hours = **14 kWh**
* *(Note: This doesn't even include the fuel for commuting or the infrastructure to produce food/water.)*

**Option B: The Vibe Coding (AI) Route**

* **Duration:** The human guides the AI. Work is compressed into **4 hours** of intense prompting and review.
* **AI Compute Cost:** Let's assume heavy LLM usage. A very pessimistic estimate is \~0.01 kWh per complex query. Let's say 500 huge queries.
   * AI Energy: 500 \* 0.01 = **5 kWh**
* **Human Systemic Load (Compressed):** The human still needs the office, but only for 4 hours.
   * Human Infra: 350W \* 4 hours = **1.4 kWh**
* **Total Energy:** 5 kWh (AI) + 1.4 kWh (Human) = **6.4 kWh**

# 3. The Psychological Factor

This is where ""Vibe Coding"" wins on efficiency. Humans suffer from **Context Switching** and **Burnout**. When a human gets stuck or tired, energy consumption doesn't stop. The lights stay on, the AC keeps running, but output drops to zero. We ""idle"" at high energy costs.

AI doesn't idle. It doesn't need to ""decompress"" by scrolling Twitter for 30 minutes with the screens on.

# The Verdict

AI models are energy-hungry beasts, yes. But **Time Compression** is the ultimate energy saver.

If Vibe Coding allows us to finish a 5-day task in 4 hours, the energy saved by NOT powering a human workspace for the remaining 36 hours likely outweighs the cost of the GPU burst.

We need to stop comparing **Calories vs. Watts** and start comparing **Lifecycle Operation Costs.**

1pczud3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/1pczud3/healing_attachment_through_pain_7_month/,Healing attachment through pain: 7 month reflections post discard,"My background: After a decades long secure marriage where we unfortunately grew apart, I met my ""dream woman"" and spent 5.5 years with an unhealed dismissive avoidant. We had no idea about attachment theory or that she had issues. 2 years of a wonderful close friendship that grew into a soulmate experience, future wife material, lots of beautiful dreams that ultimately didn't materialize. 2 absolutely fantastic years together - But; Never lived together, very rare sleepovers (\~30ish total), dates were always planned and time bound - and became increasingly infrequent and shorter. I started with a very secure attachment to her for years and ended up an anxious wreck, unless I was with her and then it was only tolerable. I became fed up - demanded closeness - and was discarded.



Here were the red flags I ignored in the dating phase: 

\- Struggles with emotions - don't we all? (No)

\- Needs a lot of alone time - I enjoy my space too and didn't ask how much. It turned out to be 23 hours and 45 minutes of alone time per day.

\- Lots of short relationships where she got ""fed up"" with her partner when she was younger. I thought she outgrew it because she was married (to another DA) for almost a decade then.

\- She talked a lót of shit about her then husband who she was divorcing and I knew she was frequently lying to him. I overlooked it because the end of a relationship is never pretty, and his DA behavior did sound super shitty. Turns out I'd get exactly the same from her some years later, lying included.

\- Preferred to sleep alone. Big deal, I thought? They say it's good for sleep quality.

\- She honestly seemed like a really solid and good person with a lot of admirable qualities that matched me really well. She thought about how to make a relationship work seriously and was willing to put in the effort. She did not have other typical red flags like overwhelm or complaining about needy partners because she had mostly other avoidant partners in her past. Some support on the emotional side, giving space, and being a good partner should do the trick - is what I thought. One of the bigger mistakes in my life.



What followed though were 2 absolutely magical years. A true soulmate experience. Many of the best moments of my life were there. I could write a romance novel about how beautiful this part was and I'm glad I lived through something like that - but I do not want to repeat it. Then those magical moments became less and less frequent and I started sometimes to feel a little anxious - which I expressed as sadness and longing. She always responded to those - on text of course - and said she wished I'd be there with her too. Or just some hug emojis later. That were the start of the ""Phase of Lies"" that kept us together for another 3 years.



Before the end of the relationship I had the following symptoms from being attached to someone but deprived of my emotional needs: 

 \- Feeling neglected, unseen, unwanted and undesirable. 

 \- Heavy amount of self-doubt.

 \- Self-blame (shame) for the slow breakdown of the relationship.

 \- Low energy and low mood all the time.

 \- Poor sleep due to the anxiety.

 \- A frequent feeling she ""should"" be next to me, should sleep next to me and be physically present. It's like I was loving a ghost: always present yet unseen.

 \- Feeling incredibly lonely even in her presence and despite being otherwise surrounded by loving people. This was physically painful and cuts to your bones. Never underestimate what true loneliness does to a human being.



Obviously none of this had anything to do with me and 100% was related to her disorganized responses to intimacy. I believe avoidants are somewhere aware of the impact of you: She saw me wither and still did nothing - her own feelings, wants and needs were always more important. They can be incredibly altruistic people but still show up extremely selfishly in relationships.



After over 5 years together we were having coffee and I was trying to get closer as usual and she told me for the first time that she's really uncomfortable with me around and asked me to leave. I said that this makes no sense - especially in the context of all the lies that she wanted time with me too. But I left that day anyway, confused, anxious and alone - and still could not figure out what was going on. I could not imagine what avoidant is because it requires the avoidant to be open about their feelings which they're not gonna do, and you can only open up about your needs and hope your partner responds or leave. Three things kept me trapped from my side: I was very much holding out hope for those first 2 magical soulmate years to return. Just a bit more effort maybe? Before the relationship I was suffering from major depression and I was worried that this would come back after she left. Fortunately it did not. I had also never been single before (by simple fates of life) and had some unfortunate preconceptions ingrained deeply in me of what that is like and what it means about someone.



I got fed up somewhere here. I told my true feelings about the relationship of feeling neglected, abandoned in times of need and unseen - and I need her situation and all the reasons why she ""couldn't"" just be there for me to change. It was a simple request that a securely attached person would have done years ago - like creating space in your life and your routine for more regular closeness with the other person. I would soon find out that all ""reasons"" for not doing that were all lies and excuses that were hiding her very real issues. She had used lies trying to control me in order to keep me distant, but always in a way that I wouldn't leave her. She expertly manipulated me, but eventually I figured it out and told her my feelings as well as that I did not believe her anymore. I wanted closeness; and did not care what happened next, though I was not ready for it.



Then the deactivation happened. Her fears got the upper hand and she pushed down all her loving feelings and attachment towards me. We had discussed marriage some months earlier at her request. I have never seen someone completely flip so fast. She told me she had no loving feelings anymore and can't stay in a relationship like that. She bawled, because it was a soulmate experience for her too, but still left. We exchanged 3 items and were done: 2+5.5 years and no mixed finances, no shared routine, no toothbrushes at each others place. A couple insignificant items exchanged and she walked away.



Months 0-2 (past): Absolutely destroyed. I was already anxious from not having my attachment needs met and these feelings went into overdrive, including a huge amount of shame and doubt. I could not eat, nor sleep, nor work. I became a pale ghost of myself and lost 10kg, a lot of it muscle mass. I have faced years of major depression and severe burnout and this was on-par with those experiences in the worst stage. I moved in with my parents just to survive. The only thing that sets it apart is that it goes away pretty soon on its own, but in terms of mental suffering it's very similar. I was incredibly confused what had just happened in my life, but fortunately came into contact with attachment theory and started to obsessively study it.



Months 2-4 (past) : Managed to eat again and I had some nights of solid sleep. Still thought about my ex all the time. I mean literally non-stop for all my waking hours and had plenty of dreams and nightmares about her too. That's how strong the addiction had gotten. Cycling all stages of grief on rapidfire. Journaling helped a lot, though much of the 'loving' things I wrote were absolutely cringe. I could not simultanouesly hold the truths ""Love of my life"", ""Best relationship of my life"", ""Best time of my life"" with the  truths ""Painfully discarded"", ""Worst relationship of my life"", ""Intense suffering"" - I did not know how to integrate those. (Here's where to start: It was fun, you were really attached, but it was never true love - because that requires sacrifice from your partner and prioritizing your partner sometimes even above yourself and avoidants simply don't do that. Only you showed up for the relationship with your whole self, and they did not.)



Months 4-6 (past) : Things started to become easier, still present but lighter, work became manageable. The daily crying stopped. Attachment began to weaken and with that the symptoms seemed to gradually reduce. Worked through the self-doubt and shame and placed the blame exactly where it belonged: with her. Still wishing I were avoidant myself so I could tolerate how little she could give - a sad truth.



Months 6-7 (present) Attachment becoming weaker, sometimes almost imperceptible. Going stretches without thinking about it. Not really mad, not really sad.  Realized how much of the relationship was based on the relief I felt when she came close (which is not love), how inconsistency really messed me up and also kept me hooked. That all dreams never materialized, and that I wouldn't want to trade our attachment styles for the world. It was fun while it lasted but ultimately I stayed too long and she is the one left with a bunch of issues she refuses to work on. I improved my boundaries and worked on my side to make sure I never become trapped like that in the future.



Months 8-9 (future): Really truly feel deeply that I don't want her back 100% with every fiber of my being. It's unfortunately still not completely true, but I can easily not take any action on this. She is so thoroughly DA that I don't worry about her coming back.



Months 10-12 (future): Enjoying my life single with a calm nervous system. Peace and safety are worth so much more than whatever the avoidant provided.



Months 12+ (future): Probably might try a date at some point, try out my new avoidant-repellant boundaries, but not soon. Definitely not soon.



Realizations:



The love of your life might not be. No matter who and how much you love them, you need to love yourself more. You need, like your life depends on it, strong boundaries in how you protect yourself and your nervous system. From the way you are talked to, the way you are touched, how much someone spends time with you and prioritizes you. We need more empathy for ourselves and our needs than we do for them. Healing from a breakup is possible, thriving in a misaligned relationship is not.



Embrace your emotional needs. Spend as much time with your partner as you want. Double text, triple text, you're an adult, do what you want. ""Needy"" is just a label that avoidants slap on people whose needs they are incapable of fulfilling. Ignore dating advice, as much of it is designed not to scare off avoidants. Be open, honest, and unflinching about the kind of a relationship you want to co-create. The more clear and detailed, the better. You are giving your partner a map of how you need to be loved; This is a wonderful thing and doesn't take away the romance at all.



""When relationships break down, it is not the fault of anyone. It is the result of both people who didn't match, who argued or poorly communicated."" is a dumb myth that protects people from accountability. When one person has severe attachment issues that they don't work on, it is 100% their fault. You don't need to carry the blame and shame for this.



Love is a skill, like running, and avoidants are like a fat person trying to run. They can run a great 100 meters and you think you can run a marathon with them - until they suddenly bail on you, exhausted and can't keep up. While you definitely are marathon material and need someone to keep pace with you. That's unfortunate for them, but you need to be determined to go over that finish line.



The hardest relationships to leave are those that are perfect 50% of the time - and you never know which you're going to get tomorrow. Consistency from your partner is vital for your nervous system to stay calm and regulated. If you stay with an inconsistent partner, you will eventually become addicted - prepare to suffer the rest of your life or prepare for the breakup from hell.



You will not get closure or accountability from them. You will have to create your own explanations for what just happened in your life. Look critically at yourself and why you didn't walk away sooner, but not more than that. Avoidants really challenge you in relationships to the extreme and having some anxious behaviors sometimes in response to that is completely normal - and does not give you part of the guilt of the relationship breaking down. I bet at least half of the r/AnxiousAttachment subreddit are only there because of their experiences with an avoidant and if they were with someone securely attached who prioritized them and their needs consistently, they wouldn't even have an issue.



If you believe in fate, the avoidant came into your life to put you on a path to prepare you for the best relationship you will ever have. It challenged you to the point of breakdown, but you learned so much. That was the purpose of the relationship: A lesson on love, on how to be an adult in a secure relationship, and never settle for less than you deserve. Learn the lesson and move on.

Staying focused on your tasks is one of the most important things you need to control if you want to make this digital product game work.

But for me, that is a hell of a lot harder than it sounds.

You see, I have this annoying thing called ADHD. 

My brain is constantly looking for dopamine in the form of distractions and shiny objects to chase. 

This means I struggle with focus *all the time*.

I have a few people I talk to about business, and having that alone helps, but it isn't enough by itself. 

I was still finding myself ending the day feeling like I’d been ""busy"" but realizing I hadn't actually done anything productive.

I had to find a way to lock in my focus, or I was going to lose, and that is *not* an option.

Believe it or not, the biggest enemy of productivity isn't laziness. 

It’s **decision paralysis**.

If you wake up in the morning and ask yourself, *""What should I do today?""* you have already lost.

Do not start your day with an L.

You want to start stacking those wins straight away.

Starting the day without a plan makes it easy to spend the first two hours of your day doom-scrolling, checking analytics, tweaking a font size, or replying on social media. 

You get overwhelmed by the sheer size of the job list you need to work on, so you can end up just sitting there, wasting your own time.

This is exactly how dreams die. 

They don't go off with a bang.

They die because you spent 6 months being ""busy"" without ever actually moving the needle.

But I found a fix. 

It’s one simple thing I do every single day that locks in my focus sessions.

Even I can’t get distracted doing this:

**I make a plan the night before.**

Every night, before I go to sleep, I write down the three specific things I need to do tomorrow. 

Not an entire list. 

Just three things I need to do.

And the trick to it is simple:

1. **I Write One Content Task:** 

This is now a post to upload here for the next day, but it could be an email, or blog post. 

Yes, I wrote this yesterday. 

This keeps the content engine (and now this sub) running.

2. **Two Needle Moving Tasks:** 

These are the things that actually build the business. 

Landing page design, hosting setup, product development, writing the email sequence, booking sales calls, whatever.

If the needle doesn't move, you don't succeed.

That is the most important thing I do every single day.

I wake up knowing what I have to do already.

Just 2 needle movers and 1 content task.

The rule that makes it work is this: 

These three things have to be done before anything else. 

No excuses allowed.

No checking emails until they are done. 

No YouTube until they are done.

No ANYTHING else at all until these three things are done.

But here is the best part: 

Once they are done, I am free to do other things.

I wake up, make a coffee, and get to work straight away. 

If I finish them by 11 AM, I can spend the rest of the day diving down rabbit holes, or looking out the window if I want to, because I know the business moved forward.

I usually end up starting tasks for tomorrow, but it is what it is.

ADHD hyper focus is both a blessing and a curse.

But this stops the overwhelm dead in its tracks because it breaks the massive project down into tiny, bite sized chunks.

You might look at it and think, *""Only two tasks? That’s not enough.""*

But do the math. 

Over a month, that is **30 pieces of content** and **60 major business moves** sorted.

That is how you build an empire.

One brick at a time…

Every single day.

So here is my advice to you:

Tonight, before you go to bed, write down your 3 tasks for tomorrow.

It could be:

1 Content piece, and 2 Needle Movers.

Or

3 Needle movers, if you’re not creating content. (But that's a daft move)

Or

Read 1 Chapter of a book / Course, and 2 Needle movers if you’re still learning a skill.

Then, you just need to wake up…

Smash the tasks…

And see how much easier it feels. 

It might just be the missing productivity hack you needed.

Let me know how you get on in the comments.

1pczt5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Low-6055/comments/1pczt5o/turn_ideas_into_action_key_lessons_from/,Turn Ideas into Action: Key Lessons from Management Training,"Sitting with a cup of coffee, talking with friends, and suddenly, a brilliant idea strikes.........It feels exciting, full of potential. But as days pass, life happens, and that idea quietly fades away.

At the School of Information Science and Management (SISM) under Subhwanti Group of Institutions (SGI), we believe that ideas are only half the story. The real power lies in turning them into action, in bridging the gap between imagination and impact. And this is what management training is designed to do.

It is not just about learning theories from textbooks; it is about cultivating the mindset, discipline, and courage to make things happen. Here are some key lessons our students learn on their journey from thought to transformation.

# Strategic Thinking - Beyond the Obvious

Every successful manager starts by thinking strategically. It is not just about having ideas, but about understanding where they fit in the bigger picture.

At the exceptional management college in Siwan, students are taught to analyze trends, identify opportunities, and make choices that align with long-term goals. They learn to see beyond the immediate excitement of an idea to evaluate its relevance, sustainability, and real-world impact.

Don’t just chase ideas that sound exciting, chase the ones that make sense in the long run.

# Planning Makes Possibilities Real

An idea, no matter how brilliant, needs structure. Management training helps students turn their abstract thoughts into clear, actionable plans step by step.

Through real-time projects and case studies, they learn tools like goal setting, task mapping, and performance tracking. The emphasis is not only on planning but on planning smartly.

A dream backed by a plan becomes a goal, and that’s where change begins.

The finest management college in Bihar, Subhwanti, offers BBA, BCA, MBA, and MCA programs at its Siwan Campus, while the BBA and BCA programs are available at the Bettiah Campus.

# Leadership: From “I” to “We”

Leadership is not about giving orders; it is about inspiring action. Students learn that the heart of leadership lies in empathy, collaboration, and clear communication.

Through group assignments, event management, and mentorship programs, they learn to unite people around a common purpose and enable collective action.

A great leader doesn’t just share an idea; they make others believe in it.

# Decision-Making - The Confidence to Choose

In management, hesitation is the enemy of progress. Decisions often have to be made with limited time and incomplete data.

Our training focuses on helping students build confidence in decision-making to analyze, decide, and adapt. Whether it’s a marketing strategy or an academic project, they learn to make choices with clarity and accountability.

The perfect decision rarely exists, but decisive action always moves you forward.

# Execution - The Hardest, and Most Rewarding Part

Turning ideas into action is a test of patience and persistence. It’s easy to plan; it’s harder to follow through.

At the prestigious management college in Bettiah, students engage in hands-on management exercises, organizing events, business simulations, and community projects that test their execution skills. They learn that consistency is the real secret ingredient behind success.

Execution is where dreams meet deadlines, and results are born.

# Communication - Turning Ideas Into Shared Understanding

A powerful idea loses its spark if it is not communicated well. Management training emphasizes strong communication skills, from presentations and group discussions to report writing and professional dialogue.

Students learn to express ideas clearly, listen actively, and adapt their message to different audiences.

Communicate not just to inform, but to inspire.

# Feedback - The Art of Learning on the Go

Every project, whether successful or not, carries lessons. The prestigious management college in Bettiah nurtures a culture of reflection and feedback. Students review their strategies, discuss what worked (and what didn’t), and identify how to improve next time.

This approach builds resilience and maturity — two traits every good manager needs.

Feedback is not criticism; it is a mirror that helps you grow.

# Adaptability - Staying Relevant in a Changing World

The world of management changes faster than ever: new technologies, evolving markets, and shifting consumer behavior.

Our curriculum encourages flexibility and innovation. Students are challenged to think on their feet, embrace change, and find opportunity even in uncertainty.

Adaptability is not about changing your goal; it is about finding smarter ways to reach it.

# Measuring Success - Because Progress Deserves Proof

At SISM, students are trained to value outcomes as much as effort. They learn to measure performance, assess results, and use data to drive improvement.

Whether in classroom projects or internship experiences, they understand that true progress must be visible, measurable, and meaningful.

Lesson: What you measure, you can manage, and what you manage, you can improve.

# The Mindset of Action - From Thinking to Doing

Perhaps the most powerful lesson of all: management isn’t just a skill, it’s a mindset.

Students of the exceptional management college in Siwan take initiative, embrace responsibility, and act with confidence. Subhwanti, keep reminding them that success rarely comes from waiting for the perfect idea; it comes from taking the first step and learning as you move forward.

Don’t wait for motivation; create it through action.

# The Subhwanti Spirit: Where Ideas Come Alive

The School of Information Science and Management (SISM) believes that education should be more than classroom learning. It should empower students to think deeply, plan wisely, and act decisively.

Our management programs blend academic rigor with hands-on experience, ensuring that every student who walks through our doors learns not just how to dream, but how to do.

Because the world doesn’t need more ideas, it needs more people who can turn those ideas into impact.

>Ideas are the spark. But management is the wind that keeps them burning bright. The finest management college in Bihar is here for you!

He already seemed upset cause our door has issue closing properly. He orders and there's a customer right behind him so i take the old man's order and then i directly take the other guy's order. While im talking the customer the old man interrupts me and says ""can I get what i ordered?"". I then say "" I will first finish taking this order"". He goes on to say ""ok, so give me my money back"", i answered ""ok, no problem"". I still choose to finish the transaction before doing so and ask the customer in front of me ""is it for here or take away? Will it be with a card?"". Once I'm done with that i proceed to give the man his coins back without a word. He then left the shop. Was i wrong for taking 2 orders in a row? Should i have completed his order first? It was only taking 30 seconds more to take that second order and i thought i could then  prep the old man's order first while starting that second order. I'm alone in that shop so i feel i have to be organized to make it as smooth as possible for everyone but if people dont have 5 minutes ahead of them why come into a local coffeeshop and not use a fast coffee chain or a self service coffee machine. You will get your coffee fast but it wont taste good. His order wasn't even take away...I'm open to criticism tho.",4,1764754136.0,barista,14,1.0,False

I live alone and I’m single, so being at home all the time makes the loneliness feel extra loud. Even when I’m working with coworkers online, I can’t really feel their tone or expressions through the screen.

It’s not that I dislike working from home, but cafes give me sense of companionship, kind like how studying in the school library make feel quietly supervised by everyone around you. So now I end up working from different cafes like four days a week.

The problem for me is it’s expensive. My salary isn't high, but I spend a lot on coffee, and sometimes can’t resist getting cakes too. I think I should just work at home, it'll save more money. And another reason I go out is because I sit in terrible positions when I’m home, can’t stay disciplined. The cafes' chairs aren’t great either, but they make me sit properly.

• Enjoy deep conversations — philosophy, life, universe, existence, meaning of it all

• Can go from “bhai ye code kyun nahi chal raha” to “bhai ye zindagi bhi Kalam hai” in the same evening ☕💻

• Into self-improvement, reading, long night walks, or just chilling with chai and good music

• If you ever felt “yaar yahan to koi mera wala banda hi nahi milta”, this is your sign.

I figured it was time to stop lurking, put myself out there, and see if I can find a genuine connection.

I’m looking for a real, low-pressure friendship. Just someone easy-going to share the day-to-day with, whether that’s venting about work, celebrating small wins, or just sending memes back and forth.

A bit about me: I like to keep a balance between being active and being creative. Lately, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole of Olympic lifting. I’m still perfecting my technique, but there is something really satisfying about the discipline of the snatch and clean & jerk. It’s become a huge part of my routine.

When I’m not at the gym, I’m usually making something. I’ve finally started writing the novel I’ve been dreaming up for years, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying. I also spend a lot of time on art and sketching, and I’m happiest when I’m cooking—I love experimenting in the kitchen and feeding people.

I’ve also picked up a couple of new hobbies recently: I’ve started getting into analog photography (still trying to figure out the lighting) and have been hiking more to get away from screens.
If you’re into video games, books, dark humour, and good conversation, I think we’d get along.

I’d love to hear from you. Tell me what you’re passionate about right now, or let’s start simple: What is your go-to tea or coffee order?",1,1764753749.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

Tumataba ako kasi nagsestress eating ako. Lalo na nung nagreview para sa board exam. In just a year, nadagdagan ako ng 15kg. Kaya every time na umuuwi ako sa bahay tuwing vacation, inaasar ako na mataba ng family ko. Ang baba na ng self-esteem ko to the point na ayaw ko makipagkita sa mga high school and college friends ko kasi ang laki ng tinaba ko last time na nakita nila ako ahaha.

I tried running kaso every time na sisimulan ko, lagi nalang may nangyayari HAHAHA or it's just me na tinatamad lol so I tried doing calorie deficit.

I started my calorie deficit last week lang. 67.6 kg yung weight ko non. I stopped eating sweets, coffees, and usual foods na kinakain ko. I started counting my calories na. Nagfruits and eggs ako. If I wanted coffee, yung black lang. First and second day, ang hirap kasi nagugutom ako kahit nakakain na ako ng 2 eggs and black coffee that morning. Then the next days, naeenjoy ko na magbilang ng cals lol. 1428 cals ako every day and minemaintain ko naman except kahapon kasi napasobra ng 56 cals hahaha. After ng second day, hindi na ako ganun nagugutom. Kaninang umaga, nagkilo ako and I lost 1kg. Nagulat lang ako since kakastart ko lang specifically nung Friday. Wala pa akong isang linggo.

Mejo nagworry lang ako kasi ang bilis ko mabawasan ng timbang. I read somewhere na kapag ganun, mabilis din madagdagan. Any tips para mamaintain ko yung pagbabawas ng timbang? Sobrang insecure na kasi ako sa weight ko. Thank you sa mga sasagot!",0,1764753569.0,fitnessph,4,0.5,False

1pczlwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1pczlwp/ghosted/,Ghosted....,"I met a girl about a year and a half ago at a place I used to play pool at. We started dating on and off. The reason it was on and off was because when she did something I didnt tolerate I would pull away. My theory is you teach people how to treat you based on what you allow. When we weren't on speaking terms I would hear from her co workers that she was telling them that her and I were talking. I always found that odd as if she didn't want anyone else to potentially date me and hit it off. Other times when I was speaking to a Co worker of hers I later found out that she had asked her Co worker if I said or asked anything about her. 

I dont know but things like that always made me feel like she was into me to some degree.

Fast forward to this year about 3 months ago we run into each other at another place. I hadn't seen her in about 4-5 months. We hit it off and hung out that night. The next morning she texts me then we started ""talking"" again. 

We had planned to take a trip to costa rica in December to go to a concert. Every week we met up however she had a bad habit of asking me to hang out then supposedly forgetting. I ended up telling her not to ever do that to me again or else im going to end up cutting her off. I admitted I liked her but was concerned that I was going to pay for this vacation and feel theres a chance she doesnt show or ""forgets"". After I admitted I liked her she started to open up more. It seemed as if she was very responsive to knowing that. The next time we saw each other she starting speaking in terms of us dating now and mentioned that she wanted her Co workers to know that I would go to see her and even got jealous when another Co worker of hers I used to talk to came up to talk to me. 

It wasnt a big deal. Her emotions I could handle. I had told her though to draw lines and not to cross them. Be mad but dont call me out of my name, be crazy but dont assume something and act on it without talking to me first etc.

The last time we saw each other we got to the point where we started being affectionate. Her  sitting on me, laying on my chest, holding hands, kissing, she even paid for the date. That night she had asked me what I was doing for Thanksgiving and if I wanted to be her plus 1 to go meet all of her friends. I told her sure. Then she asked me if I wanted to come over to her place the following morning to watch a movie and to make me coffee. I said okay. We obviously were taking things further. She even insisted that I start picking her up on dates from now on. 

The next day came and she never sent me her address. She sent me a couple texts here and there however when I texted about her coming over to my place she never responded. I then called just to try and confirm and she never picked up. I haven't heard from her since. Im not sure what happen. I think maybe she got back with her ex or maybe realized she wasnt ready for a relationship. I dont know. I wonder if thats the case then why invite me to the holidays and to her place if she didnt actually have intentions for me to actually go or wasn't relationship ready.

Its not as if she was leading me on to use me for money or gifts because thats something I never gave. I actually thought I was playing this one correct and that she liked me for me. I was going with her flow. I wasnt pressuring her to take any of these steps however all I can do at this point is accept that it wasnt what I thought and keep it pushing.

I don't tend to deviate much from 17g in, aiming for about 35-40g out in about 30-40s (including 10s preinfussion). I tend to slightly adjust my output and time depending on what the flow rate is looking like and the type of beans. 

Now, last week I added a fellow ode gen 2 to my coffee arsenal with the specific task of grinding for everything except espresso: well aware it's not designed for espresso. This morning I just thought I'd whack the Ode down to it's finest setting, throw in 18g of relatively dark roast beans and see how the Robot copes (don't know if you don't try...). No surprise, it flooded through at about 3-4 bar and I got out about 50g in 20s. I gave it a little sip before it's expected disposal and...it was really delicious! Lots of sweetness, no acidity (not very acidic beans anyway), if anything a little bitter at the end. Drank it all as an Americano and now want to be able to recreate and perfect. 

Has anyone else worked out a good recipe for Robot spro-overs that doesn't really heavily on fine adjustments to grind size? I'd love to be able to do a quick drink with the Ode and Robot which is easily repeatable. Not sure what variables I should focus on...time? Pressure? Ratios?

I’ve been using expense trackers for years, but I always had the same problems:  
Typing every transaction manually is annoying, receipt scanners misread items, and most apps feel bloated or confusing.

So I built my own app — **Smart Expense** — and I’d love honest feedback from you all.

**What makes it different**

* **AI-powered scanning**: Take a picture of any receipt, and the app extracts every item, amount, and category automatically. No manual editing needed.
* **Voice-to-expense**: You can literally say: *“Starbucks coffee 18 AED”* and it adds it instantly.
* **Super clean UI**: Minimal, simple, and fast—no ads, no popups.
* **Smart insights**: The app highlights where your money is going and gives suggestions on how to improve spending habits.
* **PDF & CSV export**: One tap to download your full monthly report.

**Why I’m posting**

I built this app as a solo developer, and I’m trying to make it genuinely useful—not just another boring budget app. I’d love:

* Feature suggestions
* UI/UX feedback
* Ideas to make the AI smarter

Local area with multiple small businesses competing against chains and online shopping. Needed creative, low-budget ways to get people through the door.

**What We Did:**

**Format 1: Multi-Business Scavenger Hunt**

Partnered with 8 other local businesses (coffee shop, bookstore, yoga studio, gift shop, etc.). Customers got a ""passport"" and visited each business to collect stamps or answers to clues.

*Cost per business:* $50-100 (printing, small prize contribution)
*Duration:* 2-week promotion
*Prizes:* Grand prize ($500 gift card bundle), plus each business offered 10-20% discount for participants

**Results:**
- 340 participants (way higher than expected)
- 78% visited businesses they'd never been to before
- 45% made a purchase during their hunt visit
- Foot traffic increased 230% during promotion period
- 15% of participants became regular customers afterward

**Why it worked:**
- Gave people a reason to explore the neighborhood
- Low barrier to entry (free to participate)
- Created ""event feel"" in a retail setting
- Social media sharing (everyone posted their stamps/progress)
- Businesses cross-promoted each other

**Format 2: Single-Business Hunt (Customer Appreciation)**

Hid clues around our store leading to different product categories. Customers who completed it got 25% off their purchase that day.

*Cost:* $30 (printed clue cards, staff time)
*Duration:* Single Saturday
*Result:* 60 participants, average transaction up 40% vs typical Saturday

**Format 3: Birthday Party Package (New Revenue Stream)**

Started offering kids' birthday parties with custom scavenger hunts. Parents love it because it's active, we love it because it's high-margin.

*Pricing:* $300-500 for 2-hour party (10-15 kids)
*Cost:* $50-75 (materials, staff time)
*Frequency:* Now booking 2-3/month

**What You Need:**

**For multi-business hunt:**
- 5+ willing business partners
- Shared customer base (important!)
- 3-4 weeks planning time
- Someone to coordinate marketing
- Prizes (split cost or each business contributes)

**For single-business hunt:**
- 10-15 clues/challenges
- Clear instructions
- Staff briefed on rules
- Social media plan to promote

**Lessons Learned:**

✅ **Do:**
- Make it easy enough to complete (1-2 hours max)
- Create Instagram-worthy moments at each stop
- Send participants a completion email asking for feedback
- Use it as email list building opportunity
- Offer small instant gratification (discount, free sample) at each stop

❌ **Don't:**
- Make clues too hard (frustration kills momentum)
- Skip promoting on social media during the event
- Forget to train staff on how it works
- Neglect follow-up marketing to participants
- Choose competing businesses as partners

**Marketing Strategy:**

*Pre-event (2 weeks out):*
- Social media posts (3-4x/week)
- Email to existing customers
- Flyers in-store
- Local Facebook groups
- Cross-promotion with partner businesses

*During event:*
- Encourage social media sharing (#LocalScavengerHunt)
- Post updates on how many people are participating
- Share photos of winners/completions

*Post-event:*
- Email all participants with thank you + special offer
- Share results/photos on social media
- Ask for testimonials
- Plan next one based on feedback

**ROI Breakdown:**

Multi-business hunt:
- Investment: $100
- New customers acquired: ~25
- Average lifetime value: $200
- ROI: ~5000%

Birthday party package:
- Investment: $200 (initial setup, marketing)
- Parties booked in 6 months: 15
- Net profit: $5500
- ROI: 2750%

**Variations We've Tried:**

1. **Holiday-themed hunts** (Christmas, Halloween) - massive engagement
2. **Loyalty program integration** - double points during hunt
3. **Couples date night version** - partnered with restaurants
4. **Virtual option** (during COVID) - surprisingly worked well

**Unexpected Benefits:**

- **PR coverage:** Local newspaper covered our multi-business hunt
- **Partnership opportunities:** Met other business owners, led to future collabs
- **Employee morale:** Staff loved the energy and something different
- **Community building:** Customers told us it made them feel more connected to the area
- **Data collection:** Built email list of 300+ local customers

**For Different Business Types:**

*Retail:* Product discovery hunt (find items matching descriptions)
*Restaurants:* Menu knowledge hunt (answer trivia, get discount)
*Service businesses:* Educational hunt (learn about your industry)
*Event venues:* Showcase spaces + capabilities
*Real estate:* Neighborhood exploration hunt

**Common Concerns:**

*""Will people just hunt and not buy?""*
Some will. But if 45% make a purchase, that's still way better than passive foot traffic. Plus, brand awareness has value.

*""I don't have time to organize this.""*
Start small. Even a 5-clue, 30-minute hunt in your own store takes about 2 hours to create and can run for weeks.

*""What if no one participates?""*
Seed it with friends/family first to create social proof. Post their participation on social media. FOMO is powerful.

**Next-Level Ideas:**

- Charge $5-10 entry fee for charity (donate to local cause)
- Create monthly subscription hunt club
- Offer ""corporate team building"" version (higher price point)
- Partner with local influencers for launch
- Create digital version with app/QR codes

**Bottom Line:**

Scavenger hunts work because they transform shopping from a transaction into an experience. People remember experiences and tell their friends about them. Traditional ads can't buy that.

The multi-business model is especially powerful because you share costs, audience, and risk. Our group now runs one quarterly and it's become a neighborhood tradition.

I will call you names and say things that you might not be but to me you absolutely are. If you're not ready for that right now, or ever, then you shan't read this now, or ever.


Hello,

It comes very hard to me the things I'm about to say because both my mind and body, especially my mind, haven't settled in with the idea of you vanishing out of my life completely, but I don't want to leave you hoping or thinking that we can be friends after everything that's been felt or said. Despite me wanting to.


You were... more than an experience... you were my everything. Even if only for a little bit. It hurts me tremendously the choice you've made yet I do not hold anything against you and I have only good words and kind wishes to hope for you and your family's future.


It started beautifully, at least for me, and how sad it is to hope and keep wishing for something that would never begin to happen.

We've seen each other,
Called each other,
Laughed with each other,
Liked each other,
Trusted each other,
Met each other,
Kissed each other,
Made coffee for each other,
Made plans with each other,
Got sad for each other,
Thought about each other,
And now we're broken up like two little gołąbki whom've never met each other.

Please, don't think even for one second that I liked or decided to spend my time with you because of your looks, your money or your body. These are things that, albeit you have, and people, myself included, would call you out of my league. But by courting you I would've raised myself to where your bar was, which was going to better myself objectively, not for you, but for myself.
So it was always for the person that you've been and still are, which I can say I'm truly proud of and whom I loved and still love very dearly. You are amazing and words fail gloriously in its own wretched way at expressing your character's beauty.

There's not much to say... really... for me it got to that point where this is already a massive heartaching heartbreak where I need to take pauses while writing the same fragment because I break down and cry.

I've drank today,
I've drank yesterday too,
I've drank the day before,
and I'll drink tomorrow, too.

I'm a mess, yes, I'm a fucking mess.
Not just now, because of these awful news you've brought me, but in general, I'm a sad mess. You were a mess too when I've met you, when we got on call and talked... so many times... everyday... for so long... heart-wrenching things that you've told me, and I would have told you too!
They meant a lot to me, and the fact you opened up and talked about all those things with me, I only hope it would've been in person, too.
But perhaps that's all my dealer's served me, a short lived yet fateful 22, I look down sweating and shaking with fear and sadness in my eyes as I realize it's the next doom-laden chapter of my life and I bust going over 21. I've lost my all-in hand with everything I've worked for for so long.

I truly hope our paths' crossing was destiny-laden so I can hate this atrocious fate that has showed you in my way when, once again, when I was not in a place of peace and well being. I'd want to grab it and choke it as I stop breathing, on my slowly descend to hell, I'd look it into eyes for the last time, as I, traumatized and unable to move, wish it's demise.

If this were a page, it'd feel both unending and not enough, meaningless and more than a human can feel, overflowing with nothing else but tears, falling down due to loving to much, and not having been loved enough.

It hurts to say it's eliberating but also painful how I believe there aren't too many events that we've shared for me to cry this much, to feel this much, to break this much. Yet, it's less to swipe under the rug and forget about it, ignore it whenever it looks at me and step next to it the upcoming times I'll be having guests over.

I will be drinking, a lot, smoking, all the time, plus even more. My motivation has left me, my sporadically happy parrot died in its infinite cage due to its inability to find a soulmate with all that nothingness and space lying around crowdedly, suffocatingly and awkwardly having been misplaced around.

You are amazing, you are absolutely drop down gorgeous and breath taking, you're so pretty even your tears shine like diamonds, I'd compliment your eyes too but I fear of making it sound like a cliché and honestly I've been complimented by them more than I could ever write about them.
You're tall, that's a good thing, a fucking model, a national treasure and currently a personal wealth that I've lost without ever having it. Smart and mature, yet still unable to home the depth of my feelings for you. 

The kindest person I've ever met. Yes, you surpass my brother.
The best cook, why does food actually taste good when made by people I love?
I've never seen something more perfect in my life besides... you... an imperfectly perfect girl, woman and daughter, I'm just sad I can't see you as the mother of my children as well...

I didn't know our last hug would be... our... last... hug....
I should've never let you go to work....
I didn't know our last kiss would be our last, I wish I could remember it better.
I wish I wouldn't have to delete duolingo again, I've just got 9 days on Polish and German and that fucking ""Mężczyzna"" word was finally getting  in my memory on how to write it, and I've learned verbs and a bit of grammar and pronunciation and asked some poles to help me learn and now it's all futile.
I wish... things would've ended up differently... I wish it was me the one that'd get to make you happy, but I guess this is another colossal catastrophe proving I'm never enough no matter what, where I always end up losing in the end despite not doing anything wrong.
Always too much or not enough...

I'm only disappointed we'll never be able to do all those things that I wish, that I dreamed of, that I lived in my mind repeatedly, endlessly, continously, over and over again, on repeat.
Such things are:
Taking you out on a date,
Buying you flowers, 
Taking you to an amusement park,
Watching horror movies while cuddled,
Meeting your family, shaking your dad's hand firmly while mentaining eye contact as someone who's worthy of being there, winning your babunia's trust, hugging your mother and whispering her my thanks for raising such an amazing daughter, moving together, raising children with you, these are only a few.
I really wanted to do everything with you, but you already did do a part of them without me; and mentioning eating kiwis together is too colloquial for my horrid soliloquy on paper written on some plastic surface with my cells' blood and sealed in tears.

If you've reached this far you're probably wondering if I changed my mind mid-writing or had I forgot to call you names, truth is, that was, while factually true, because I did call you names, kind names, pretty names, cute names, they are names! And when I said those things about yourself, I do believe with all my being that they're true and you won't have the opportunity to change my impression again.

Truth is, I love writing, and as every writer that writes with blood straight from their heart's blood vessels, I write better after omnious pivotal events happened in my life, you've finally reached the highest status of emboddyng a muse truly worth bleeding ink for. I loved you. You dum dum.

And oh God, have this not be my best and most poetry like ""letter"", I truly pity both myself and my heart for the eventuality that I get hurt worse than this in the gut wrenching future of mysery which awaits little poor me.

1pczcen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1pczcen/event_full_speed_ahead/,[EVENT] Full Speed ahead.,"Belo Horizonte woke to an unusually 
clear morning. The winter sun sat low, lighting the hills in a straightforward, sharp way that made the city’s edges look cleaner than usual. From the top floor of the state palace, Juscelino Kubitschek stood at the window with his hands behind his back, observing the urban sprawl he had helped push forward. Even in silence he seemed to be walking several paces ahead of everyone else.


In the room behind him, advisers shuffled papers and spoke in the low, careful voices of men who knew their governor hated to be kept waiting. To JK, time was a production line: if a steel mill could run to the minute, so could a government. At last he turned, offering the small, deliberate smile that invariably calmed nervous rooms. “Podemos começar.” The table was cleared in seconds. Maps unrolled like battle plans: railways threading the interior, hydroelectric dams, industrial axes that bypassed the old coastal privileges. Beside them, lists, PSD barons who would come cheaply, PTB chieftains who would not, governors still bargaining, generals who wanted guarantees that the country would remain quiet enough for them to polish their boots in peace.Kubitschek listened without fidgeting while his team recited the familiar litany: the UDN lackeys whispering against him, old generals in Rio suspicious of any man who refused to kneel, industrialists fretting about inflation, editors sharpening their knives. He heard it all, nodding occasionally, eyes half-closed, as though the obstacles were merely measurements to be taken before pouring concrete.

Then he leaned over the map and tapped the empty heart of the country, Goiás, Mato Grosso, the vast, sleepy center. “Here,” he said quietly. “Brazil doesn’t lack land or ore or water. It lacks nerve. ”The eldest adviser, a veteran of too many lost campaigns, coughed. “With respect, Doctor Juscelino, nerve doesn’t vote. People do.” JK’s laugh was short, almost kind. “People follow the man who knows where the road goes. Show them the road, and they’ll pave it for you.” From that sentence the plan emerged, precise and understated: a discreet swing through the drought-scarred Northeast; dinners in São Paulo with factory owners who wanted a president who spoke in kilowatts and tonnage; quiet coffees with colonels who feared reds more than they feared change.The agreements came slowly, the way a good engineer prefers, load-bearing, tested, signed in triplicate. A senator in Bahia shifted. A governor in Pernambuco asked for a private meeting. Even the carioca newspapers, which had once mocked him as the smiling doctor from Diamantina, began to wonder whether the smile concealed a steel girder.


When night finally settled, Kubitschek sent the others away. He returned to the window alone. Belo Horizonte glittered below him, orderly, prosperous, believable. The city was the scale model; the country would be the real thing. He placed both palms on the cool sill, looked out at the lights he had helped switch on, and allowed himself one small, unguarded nod.The decision was no longer pending. It had already been made, months ago, somewhere between the drawing board and the horizon.

recently there happened a famous talk on internet.

recently, there are talks about Kamath (famous CEO in India), where he is interviewing Musk (Elon Musk, World's richest person)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

a few observation points from psychology point of view -

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sipping coffee or taking interview ?

\_entire conversation, Kamath is seen sipping coffee (atleast 1-st 80 minutes), while Musk is seen sipping coffee, half the time, as Kamath.

""More you do in a frame, lesser you get observed.""

In an interview session, (casual talk), it is 2 people are talking, sipping coffee or tea, but, it looks 'better' if people in the frame, do only just 1 thing - talk.

The host's attention should only be on guest, not on guest and coffee.

To the guest, it may feel dis-respectful. When one is listening, one should only listen. One should have their eyes, and face, towards the one speaking.

It shows you have respect for the one speaking.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_Body language -

Kamath's body language - legs crossed. Body leaning on table. (throughout)

Musk's body language - straight. Back against couch. Legs, extended. Shows full-confidence (throught-out).

While Kamath's body langauge is okay, but, this shows somewhere, the person is eagerly waiting for other person (Musk) in front to reply.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_Interruptions

Interruptions are always part of conversations, but we Indians, generally like to interrupt more, when other person is talking.

interruptions are seen, where Musk is talking, he is taking off speaking, on something, but, suddenly, Kamath interrupts.

This is seen happening in the video, 4 times.

Interrupting other person, shows, you are not good listener somewhere. It shows, when other was speaking, you were too busy thinking, and criticizing in your mind (that why you would interrupt, otherwise, why would you interrupt ?).

in case you want to interrupt someone, it is better to remain silent, for 5 to 10 seconds, Then, politely, say, ""Am I allowed to interrupt ?"".

This looks better. This is what happens usually in podcasts in the Western World. It looks better, sounds pleasing. Sounds more professional.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Nodding - Musk is seen nodding his neck multiple times up and down.

It is a positive gesture. Most influential peole do that.

While your friend is asking a question, and you have an answer for that question, it is good gesture to nod your neck first, before speaking.

It shows to other person, that you are listening. Also, 'sudden' movement neck allows you to switch your thought, and make room for more thoughts.

Musk is seen doing that quite often in other interviews too. Maybe, that is why he is a good speaker.

Nodding, slight movement in neck, when you are listening, shows you are listening, and respect the speaker.

1pcz8wo,https://i.redd.it/827dynt1ey4g1.jpeg,"AI Agent Payments vs Web2 Payment Gateways: Cost, Latency, Control","As the emergence of decentralized AI agents accelerates, **AI Agent Payments** become a core pillar for enabling autonomous, machine-to-machine commerce. In contrast, traditional Web2 payment gateways are built for human-initiated transactions — they were never designed to support large-scale, high-frequency, micro-payments by autonomous agents. In this article, we compare **AI Agent Payments vs Web2 Payment Gateways** from three critical dimensions: **cost, latency, and control** — and explain why [**MEMO**](https://memolabs.org/) is uniquely positioned to deliver next-generation payment infrastructure for AI agents.

 

**1. Cost: from expensive human payments to micro-payments at scale**

Traditional Web2 gateways (credit card processors, payment platforms, etc.) charge fixed or percentage-based fees per transaction. This model works for human e-commerce: a coffee, a service subscription, or a one-off purchase — but it breaks down when transactions are frequent, small, and automated.

For autonomous AI agents — especially in a future where agents pay for data access, storage, compute, or API usage — each micro-transaction must be extremely inexpensive. Otherwise the cost overhead overshadows the value of the interaction.

By using **AI Agent Payments** built on blockchain rails (as implemented within MEMO’s ecosystem), each payment becomes nearly costless. The overhead of traditional billing disappears. With MEMO’s integration of the protocol x402, agents can execute **task-level micro-transactions automatically**, with minimal fees or gas costs.

This dramatic reduction in per-transaction cost makes high-throughput, frequent agent-to-agent or agent-to-service interactions economically feasible. AI services, data retrieval, storage access — all become affordable at micro scale.

 

**2. Latency: instant, automated payments vs human-centric delays**

Web2 payment systems often involve manual user interactions, human input, or banking-system latency. Even when gateways advertise “instant” payments, settlement, verification, or fraud checks can introduce delays of seconds to minutes — or even hours for certain operations.

But **AI Agent Payments** demand **real-time execution and confirmation**: agents need to know immediately whether a payment succeeded so they can continue their tasks (e.g. calling APIs, retrieving data, computing results). Any delay breaks the automation loop.

With MEMO’s blockchain-based payment rails, transactions can be confirmed on-chain almost instantly. Using x402, payments happen as part of the agent’s workflow — without human intervention or gating. That means **sub-second settlement**, deterministic outcomes, and machine-readable receipts. This latency advantage is foundational for real-time, large-scale agent economies.

 

**3. Control: decentralized wallets & smart-contract logic vs centralized gatekeepers**

Web2 gateways are centralized: payment providers control the rules, handle compliance, can freeze or block accounts, and require manual identity or KYC processes. For AI agents — which may be globally distributed, autonomous, and anonymous — centralized gatekeepers are a bottleneck. They introduce trust requirements, censorship risk, and limit interoperability.

In contrast, **AI Agent Payments** on MEMO give control back to users and agents themselves. Agents operate via decentralized wallets, smart-contract logic defines payment rules, and no centralized party can arbitrarily block or interfere. Agents gain autonomy, sovereignty, and trustless execution.

Moreover, MEMO’s broader stack ensures that payment, identity, data storage, and data assetization work together seamlessly. With decentralized identity (via MEMO DID / ERC-8004) + data asset standards (ERC-7829) + decentralized storage (MEFS) + compute — you get a full-fledged AI-native ecosystem. Payments are just one piece, but a critical one.

This level of control, transparency, and flexibility cannot be replicated with Web2 payment gateways.

 

**4. Why MEMO’s Full-Stack Approach Makes AI Agent Payments Powerful**

What makes **MEMO** stand out is not just that it supports AI Agent Payments — but that it integrates them into a **full-stack AI-native infrastructure**. Here’s how MEMO layers different components together:

1. **Decentralized Identity & Reputation**: Using [**MEMO DID**](https://datadid.memolabs.net/) \+ ERC-8004, each agent has a unique on-chain identity, verifiable reputation and interaction history. This solves trust issues in multi-agent systems.
2. **Automated Payments**: Through x402-based AI Agent Payments, agents can transact value — pay for storage, data, computation, or services — automatically and instantly.
3. **Data as On-Chain Assets**: With ERC-7829, data sets, embeddings, knowledge bases, AI outputs can be tokenized as on-chain assets. This bridges data ownership, monetization, and portability.
4. **Decentralized Storage & Compute**: Using MEFS (MEMO File System) and DePIN-based decentralized infrastructure, data and compute remain distributed, private, and censorship-resistant.

Because of this integration, when an AI agent pays via **AI Agent Payments**, it’s part of a larger flow: identity — payment — data access — computation — data assetization. The whole lifecycle is seamless, autonomous, and user-centric.

This full-stack design empowers developers and users alike — you don’t just get a storage network, or a payment system, or a data marketplace. You get a unified AI-native ecosystem where value — data, computation, identity, payment — flows freely under decentralized control.

 

**5. The Limits of Web2 Gateways in the Era of Autonomous AI**

Let’s summarize why Web2 payment gateways fall short when facing the demands of AI agent economies:

* **High per-transaction cost** — works for human payments but prohibitive for high-frequency micro-payments.
* **Latency and settlement delays** — break automation, hinder real-time workflows.
* **Centralized control / gatekeeping** — threatens censorship-resistance, trustlessness, global interoperability.
* **No integration with data, identity, or compute layers** — meaning payment is isolated, not part of a broader autonomous ecosystem.

For modern AI-native systems — where agents buy data, rent compute, exchange value, collaborate — these limitations are fatal.

 

**Conclusion: AI Agent Payments Are Foundational — MEMO Is Building the Infrastructure**

In the comparison **AI Agent Payments vs Web2 Payment Gateways**, it’s clear that for the future of decentralized AI — **AI Agent Payments** win in **cost, latency, and control**.

But more than that: when combined with decentralized identity, data assetization, decentralized storage and compute — the result is a **full-stack, AI-native economy**. That’s exactly what **MEMO** offers.

If you are building AI agents, decentralized applications, or a data-driven AI service — relying on Web2 gateways will hold you back. Embrace **AI Agent Payments** on MEMO, and be part of the next generation of autonomous, user-centric, value-generating AI.",1,1764752113.0,u_memolabs,0,1.0,False

Kamath's body language - legs crossed. Body leaning on table. (throughout)

Musk's body language - straight. Back against couch. Legs, extended. Shows full-confidence (throught-out).

While Kamath's body langauge is okay, but, this shows somewhere, the person is eagerly waiting for other person (Musk) in front to reply.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_Interruptions

Interruptions are always part of conversations, but we Indians, generally like to interrupt more, when other person is talking.

interruptions are seen, where Musk is talking, he is taking off speaking, on something, but, suddenly, Kamath interrupts.

This is seen happening in the video, 4 times.

Interrupting other person, shows, you are not good listener somewhere. It shows, when other was speaking, you were too busy thinking, and criticizing in your mind (that why you would interrupt, otherwise, why would you interrupt ?).

in case you want to interrupt someone, it is better to remain silent, for 5 to 10 seconds, Then, politely, say, ""Am I allowed to interrupt ?"".

This looks better. This is what happens usually in podcasts in the Western World. It looks better, sounds pleasing. Sounds more professional.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Nodding - Musk is seen nodding his neck multiple times up and down.

It is a positive gesture. Most influential peole do that.

While your friend is asking a question, and you have an answer for that question, it is good gesture to nod your neck first, before speaking.

It shows to other person, that you are listening. Also, 'sudden' movement neck allows you to switch your thought, and make room for more thoughts.

Musk is seen doing that quite often in other interviews too. Maybe, that is why he is a good speaker.

Nodding, slight movement in neck, when you are listening, shows you are listening, and respect the speaker.

I’d sit in front of my laptop for hours, but mentally… I just wasn’t there.

The brain fog was real.  
Not the “I need more sleep” kind—  
but the heavy, annoying, *persistent* kind that makes every task feel like you’re dragging a suitcase full of bricks.

My name’s Sam, 29, and I work in Tech Support.  
My job pretty much runs on focus, yet suddenly I was re-reading the same line three times before any of it made sense.  
Coffee didn’t help.  
Extra sleep didn’t help much either.

# The Moment Things Started to Shift

One night, while doom-scrolling Reddit (as usual), I found a thread about supplements that people use for focus and cognitive support.  
I wasn’t looking for a miracle or anything dramatic—  
I just wanted something that could help me feel like *myself* again.

After checking out a bunch of options, I came across **NeuroVera (Bran)**.  
What caught my attention was that it’s based on natural ingredients people already use for general brain support.  
No crazy claims. No magic promises.

So I figured… why not?  
Worst case, nothing changes.

# What I Didn’t Expect

After about two weeks of taking it consistently, something subtle happened:  
My mornings weren’t a battle anymore.

I wasn’t staring at my screen waiting to “warm up.”  
I could jump into tasks faster and stay on them without bouncing between 15 tabs.

I’m not saying it turned me into a superhero,  
but I definitely felt sharper, more present, and way less mentally drained.

My friends noticed I seemed more upbeat.  
My boss noticed I was getting more done.  
And honestly, I just felt closer to the old version of myself—the one I thought I’d lost somewhere along the way.

# Why I’m Sharing This Here

Because someone out there might be going through the same thing and thinking they’re “burnt out” or “lazy.”  
Sometimes your brain just needs a little support.

Of course, everyone’s different, so what worked for me might not work for everyone.  
But since this community talks a lot about brain supplements, I figured I’d share my experience.

Sipping coffee or Interviewing ?

\_entire conversation, Kamath is seen sipping coffee (atleast 1-st 80 minutes), while Musk is seen sipping coffee, half the time, as Kamath.

""More you do in a frame, lesser you get observed.""

In an interview session, (casual talk), it is 2 people are talking, sipping coffee or tea, but, it looks 'better' if people in the frame, do only just 1 thing - talk.

The host's attention should only be on guest, not on guest and coffee.

To the guest, it may feel dis-respectful. When one is listening, one should only listen. One should have their eyes, and face, towards the one speaking.

It shows you have respect for the one speaking.

How can someone who's condemned to eternal torment supposed to be happy?

But here's the thing: It's a myth. And myths are independent of logic.

We can choose for a logical outcome to a myth, or we can head-canon something else entirely.  Which is exactly what Camus did here. 

The first step is of course, the acknowledgement that it's just a myth. 
If we take it as a true story, then our minds can't help but to search for the most logical reasonings and interpretations. 

We can no longer imagine Sisyphus happy, because we no longer dare to imagine. A mental wall, preventing us from a happy ending, because we expect everything to make sense.

But can we truly make sense of the world? Those who tried,  have either gone mad, given up entirely, or died before reaching a desired resolution 

Instead of making sense of the world, we should try understanding it. As Camus said: 
""In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion""

The world we're living in, exceeds human logic and is indifferent towards it.
But we can still understand it, in ocasisns.

In moments of joy, a sip of coffee, a family gathering, reuniting with friends for a night out, a lunch break with your favorite food,  those little things turn on a flickering light bulb in our minds.  Those little moments are what makes life meaningful, and worthwhile.

In terms of logic however, one can argue that life has more downs then ups. And you're right. But there's nothing wrong In imagining yourself happy, even in low moments.

1pcywvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Deneysville/comments/1pcywvn/why_community_involvement_matters/,Why Community Involvement Matters,"The heart of Deneysville: Why Community Involvement Matters
When I first came to Deneysville some years ago, something that struck me was how empty of pedestrians the streets 
were. I never saw any friends jogging, any families strolling or neighbours chatting over the fences. The village 
seemed deserted. It was little different when popping into shops. Everything was quiet.
Back then, it was a welcome change from the busyness of the Highveld.
When we were building impetus for the Village Fayre all those years ago. I remember asking the question: 
“Deneysville: sleepy hollow or vibrant village?” The joyous truth is we don’t need to choose; we can be BOTH!!
We are the small village with the big heart – and it isn’t just a slogan. It’s the truth. Our people are the heartbeat of 
this place, the very rhythm behind every event, every initiative, every small business and every spark of the Vaal Dam 
Vibe we are working so hard to build.
A community doesn’t happen by accident. It is created – moment by moment – by the people who show up. Whether 
we are attending local events, supporting our restaurants and pubs, helping out our neighbours, or simply arriving with 
that warm, joyful energy that is so uniquely Deneysville, we are the ones shaping the atmosphere we love.
The vibe we talk about so often isn’t something floating in the air. We create it. It’s carried in our smiles, our 
willingness to participate, our readiness to help and our pride in our little village.
So how do we, the people of Deneysville, actually make a difference in our day-to-day lives? It happens in small, 
almost, invisible ways that quietly grow into something powerful.
Every time we choose a positive conversation – whether we’re sitting in a coffee shop, chatting to a friend, or popping 
into a local business – we plant a seed. A new idea shared, a practical solution offered, or a hopeful suggestion about 
improving our town doesn’t just stop with the person we say it to. It gains traction. It gathers momentum. Before 
long, you hear someone else saying, “Did you hear so-and-so’s idea? Maybe we should try that.” That is how 
positive change spreads: word by word, person by person.
The opposite is also true. When we complain – on WhatsApp groups, to neighbours, or in passing – it chips away at 
morale. It weakens the sense of hope that keeps a community alive. Complaints on their own don’t fix anything; they 
only discourage the people who might have stepped forward to help. When negativity sets in, fewer people try, fewer 
people care and the whole town feels it.
The thing to constantly keep top of mind is that we influence one another far more than we realise. By what we say, 
by what we do – we even influence each other simply by how we live.
When we take pride in our pavements, our gardens, our walls, our fences – when we create something attractive, tidy, 
or full of curb appeal – we are sending a message. The people who drive past notice. Our neighbours notice. 
Visitors notice. A well-kept home doesn’t just lift our own spirits; it sparks ideas in others. Someone sees a fresh coat 
of paint, a neat walkway, a cheerful flowerbed, or a creative touch and thinks, I can do something like that too.
And just like that, one home influences a street, a street influences a neighbourhood and a neighbourhood influences 
the entire vibe of Deneysville.
The same applies to supporting local business. If we have enjoyed a meal or brought a worthwhile product or found a 
wonderful bargain, a friend might well notice and ask about it, or we might share our joy in our outing or purchase. 
This encourages others to get out there and try whatever we have tried. This is the power of word of mouth. I am 
constantly surprised by how many long-standing residents of Deneysville are unaware of the various upliftment 
projects. If you are unaware of what the DBTA is doing, please ask on WhatsApp 067 121 6660. If you are aware, 
please share with those with whom you chat.
That’s how a small village becomes a village with a big heart. That’s how we grow our Vibe DNA – together, through 
everyday actions that multiply.
So let’s RELAX through the sleepy times, let’s JOIN the social events, let’s ENJOY each other, let’s CELEBRATE our 
differences. Let’s cheer our competitors on, let’s encourage those who try something new.
In order to be a destination of FIRST choice, we need variety, we need supporters and we need enthusiastic business 
owners who work together, laugh together and happily welcome patrons and visitors who we chat to about the 
Deneysville we love.
Let’s BE the community we long to live in. Let’s DIVE INTO DENEYSVILLE FOR DAM GOOD VIBES.

He was a big part of my life until I was 16 — we had a lot of fun together, and he played a strong role in raising me. During that time, though, he had multiple affairs on my mum, which eventually ended their relationship.

Even after that, things between us were okay for a while. But once he met another woman and she got pregnant, our dynamic started to shift. We still saw them regularly at first. I was happy for them and even babysat their child, but over time their relationship became toxic. He cheated on her multiple times, she was emotionally unstable, and it eventually ended in a domestic violence claim and a very messy breakup. She took their child and moved interstate in Australia.

Over the years, I’ve noticed a pattern of lack of effort and lack of caring from him, even though I know he does care deep down. He’ll get choked up talking about us or the past, but his words and actions don’t always match.

Some examples of why our relationship is strained:

A few years ago, I told him via email that I’d been abused by his father (my step grandfather) from ages 8 to 16. I asked if we could discuss it in person. He replied apologetically and said we would talk… then 18 months went by. During that time I saw him multiple times, and he completely buried his head in the sand. Only after I raised it again did we finally discuss it.

Around the same time, we had a conversation about mining culture. I was working on a campaign to educate men about harassment and sexism at work. He, who’s big in mining and has some very outdated views on women, said something along the lines of, “These women dress like sluts at the gym on site.” Essentially, he was suggesting that harassment in the workplace is justified. I tried to address it and even set up a coffee to talk about why that kind of comment is harmful. He doubled down, and our relationship hasn’t been the same since.


Since then, he’s been largely absent. He forgets birthdays, doesn’t ask me a single question when we catch up (not even a basic “How are you?”), and has recently gotten involved with another woman who’s caused serious problems — including drugs, domestic violence, and other drama.

Recently, my family has suggested I “owe it” to him to get involved or stand by him in this new situation. I feel like I don’t. After everything with my own abuse, and after he buried his head in the sand instead of supporting me, I shouldn’t be expected to involve myself in dangerous and stressful situations in his life. I appreciate it’s his dad and that it’s awkward, but I am his daughter — not his emotional or logistical support in crises he’s chosen to be involved in.

Because of all this, I’ve chosen to keep minimal contact. I still see him at family events and milestones, and I’m polite, but I don’t go out of my way to call or visit. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells whenever he comes up, or I end up being made to feel like I’m doing something wrong — which leaves me feeling depressed and drained.

My mum and sister think I’m being extreme. They say things like, “So what, you’re never going to see him again?” or “The more you create this space, the worse it’ll get.” They think I should rise above it because he helped raise me and “he means well.” But I feel like they’re ignoring the ways he’s hurt me and how little he’s done to repair it.

I know he loves us in his own way, but love without consistent caring or effort doesn’t feel like enough. To me, I’m not being cruel — I’m protecting myself from a relationship that feels one-sided and emotionally taxing.

So, AITA for keeping minimal contact with my stepdad, even though my family thinks I owe him more?",7,1764750283.0,AITAH,14,0.89,False

My very first trip was a solo backpacking mission, and while it was incredible, man, was it overwhelming. I spent so much time figuring out trains, buses, and directions that I sometimes missed just being *present*. That’s when I tried my first organized Asia tour a few years later, and it totally changed my perspective.

I know “tours” can sometimes have a… let’s say… *rigid* reputation. But modern Asia tours are a different beast. They’re less about herding you from spot to spot and more about providing a framework for an epic adventure you don’t have to stress over. Think of it like having a local friend who handles the logistics – the tricky inter-city transport, the ""how do we even get there?"" day trips, and the hotel bookings in places where language is a real barrier – so you can focus entirely on the experiences.

The real magic, for me, is the access and the people. A good tour guide will take you to that hidden family-run noodle shop you’d never find on Google Maps. They’ll explain the temple etiquette so you don’t accidentally offend. And then there’s the group itself. Sharing that “wow” moment at Angkor Wat at sunrise, or the slightly hysterical laughter of trying street food together, creates instant travel friends. That camaraderie is something you just can’t buy when you’re totally on your own.

Of course, not all tours are created equal. The key is finding one that matches your travel style. There are adventure-focused tours for hiking and biking, foodie tours that are basically a movable feast, and cultural deep-dives with more history and workshops. Doing your research is half the battle.

Now, whether you go with a tour or plan it yourself, having a solid outline is everything. I remember on one trip, I wasted a whole afternoon because I didn’t realize how far apart two ""must-see"" spots in a city actually were. After a few hiccups like that, I became obsessed with efficient planning. I actually ended up creating a **printable guide collection, “8 Countries, 1 Epic Adventure,”** just to help with this. It’s not a tour, but it gives you that same kind of logistical clarity if you’re doing it solo. It has table itineraries you can tweak, budgeting tips, and key phrases – all stuff that helps you build your own perfect trip, or even just helps you appreciate the free time on a tour more. If you’re curious, you can [check it out here](https://asiajourney.org/8Countries-ebooks).

So, what’s your take? Are you a die-hard independent planner who loves the thrill of figuring it all out? Or have you had an amazing experience on an Asia tour that showed you a side of a place you’d never have found alone?

1pcyp88,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfLoathingSavedMe/comments/1pcyp88/imitation_and_understanding/,Imitation and Understanding,"We begin by learning through imitation.
We follow the patterns others have already created,
memorizing the diagrams and formulas given to us,
reaching the answer the way we memorize “1+1=2.”
It looks like learning, but in reality it is closer to repeating memory.
Imitation alone never grows insight,
because imitation always moves only within a frame someone else has already built.

Understanding is different.
Understanding is not remembering the answer,
but digging into the mechanism that produces the answer.
“What does ‘adding’ actually mean?”
“What happens when 1 meets 1?”
The moment we ask these questions, what moves in the mind is not a diagram, but a relationship.

A person who grasps relationships does not freeze when a new problem appears.
1+2, 3+4, 5+7…
Not memory, but the structure they built themselves begins to operate.
This is active thinking.

When active thinking begins, context naturally attaches itself.
Discomfort, efficiency, contrasting ideas, direction—
these conditions of change begin to pile on.
The simple act of “adding” expands into
subtracting, multiplying, dividing.
It becomes not problem-solving, but world-interpreting.

In the end, imitation is an image, and understanding is a structure.
Imitation memorizes the surface of a phenomenon;
understanding sees the internal mechanism that makes the phenomenon possible.
This is why insight cannot come from imitation.
Insight always begins with “why?”,
breaking through the surface of the image
and forming one’s own inner definition.

So the advice to “grow your container” is not vague at all.
It means moving from copying patterns
to understanding relationships.
If you stay in imitation, knowledge only piles up.
Once you cross into understanding, that knowledge becomes your structure.
From that moment, problems stop being something to memorize
and become something to interpret and create from.

Take a simple example: drinking coffee.
Depending on perspective, the meaning is entirely different.
Some drink because others drink it,
some lift the cup out of habit,
some simply feel “the sensation of waking up.”
But someone else notices not the feeling,
but the sensation itself of waking up.
Here is where the difference appears.

The moment you capture the sensation, you begin to see a structure in coffee.
Inside the structure of sensation,
habit, mood, action, and need
all connect and move together.
Once this structure forms, coffee is no longer just a beverage—
it becomes a condition for productivity,
a shift in rhythm,
a starting point of focus.
Its meaning expands.

And this meaning generates further perspectives.
Someone who understands the mechanism of “waking up” can apply that essence to other domains.
Naturally, ideas emerge beyond coffee—
energy drinks, focus aids, rhythm-management tools.
A simple act gives birth to new possibilities.

This is the decisive difference between imitation and understanding.
A person who imitates sees only coffee in coffee,
but a person who understands structure sees in coffee
a material that expands their entire world.",1,1764749935.0,SelfLoathingSavedMe,0,1.0,False
1pcyp3e,https://i.redd.it/9owmmo6i7y4g1.png,My 8-year love was a joke. My boyfriend proposed to another woman on my birthday.,"For eight years, I loved Andrew in silence, curing his hangovers while he chased his childhood crush.



The final blow came when I was looking through my phone: a video of him prroposing to Charlotte-the A-list actress-went viral online, and Charlotte is now pregnant with his child.



My world shattered.



""After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait.""



On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed to her. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with me.



""It's PR,"" he said, like he was reading the weather. ""Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.""



I scoffed, ""PR? So you're actually getting a marriage license and throwing a real wedding?""



""It's fake, alright? Quit digging,"" he muttered.



""I don't want to referee whatever circus you and Charlotte have going,"" I said, ""but you and I still need to close our books.""



I drew a slow breath. ""We're done. I'm out.""



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



""Mr. Sinclair, I'll marry you,"" Sophia Fraley slurred. She'd just killed half a bottle of vodka, and her tongue felt three sizes too big.



A long silence answered her. Then a deep, sleepy voice came through, irritation clear beneath the gravel. ""You even know what time it is?""



She squinted at her phone and finally saw two in the morning. ""Sorry. I'll call tomorrow.""



""Okay,"" Henry Sinclair muttered.



She blinked. ""Wait, what?""



""I'll leave on a business trip in the morning. Back in four weeks. We'll sign the papers then,"" he said.



""Oh... okay.""



The line clicked off. Sophia stared at the screen, her head spinning.



Two weeks earlier, her aunt Amanda, who lived in a distant small town, had called.



She said, ""Belinda, the old lady next door, she's got this perfect grandson, Henry. Honors student, decent college, city job, dental plan, and even Christmas bonuses. I think maybe I can set you guys up.""



Sophia agreed to shut her up, planning to ghost.



That same night, however, Henry phoned. ""No time for blind dates or small talk,"" he'd said. ""If you're up for it, let's skip straight to the courthouse.""



'Is this guy nuts?' she wondered, blindsided.



He didn't wait for an answer. ""Sleep on it,"" he said, and the line went dead.



She hadn't thought about it once, until tonight, drunk and lonely, she dialed.



\*\*\*\*\*



Sophia flicked through her phone, and the internet was still losing it. The NO.1 on the feed: Charlotte Wynn, A-list queen, knocked up. And the guy everyone swore was the father was Richard Lane, the married leading man.



The ""home-wrecker"" hashtags were flying when Andrew Carter, the Carter Group's spare heir, suddenly jumped in.



He posted: \[She's my girl, the baby's mine, and we're walking down the aisle. Chill.\]



Skeptics kept clapping back, so Andrew dropped a clip from Charlotte's last birthday: him on one knee, ring box open, and her squealing yes.



Overnight, the comment section flipped to heart-emojis and champagne gifs.



Now the top tag was simply: \[Charlotte's marrying Andrew Carter\].



Sophia stared at the screen, half-laughing, half-sick. 'I'm his girlfriend, and he's out there proposing to someone else? Eight years, and I don't even get a goodbye text. Fine. Time to bail before the joke's on me.'



And Henry had said it so casually on the phone: ""I just want the regular deal. Have each other's backs, stay cool, and grow gray together."" That single sentence sold her.



Boring, maybe, but it sounded like heaven. Andrew had never even once offered her a boring promise.



She took a breath and then yanked her suitcase from the closet. The villa was in Andrew's name; she was only a visitor who'd overstayed. Time to ghost before the happy couple came home.



\*\*\*\*\*



Sophia had an early shift, so she'd only grabbed a couple of hours of sleep before dragging herself downstairs.



Andrew was spread across the couch, hair wrecked, brows pinched like the liquor still had a grip.



She side-stepped the mess and started making breakfast.



While the coffee brewed, Andrew shuffled into the kitchen, breath still boozy, and draped himself over her shoulders.



He muttered, ""Babe, my head's splitting. Make me that hangover drink, yeah?""



Sophia frowned, ""Go sit on the couch. I'll be there in two minutes.""



""But I wanna stay with you,"" he mumbled, his eyes still closed.



""You smell awful,"" she said, wrinkling her nose.



""Really?"" He sniffed his shirt and grimaced. ""Okay, shower first.""



She filled the blender with ice, a fistful of fresh mint, orange juice, a big squeeze of honey, and a pinch of salt. It was the homemade reset button she kept ready for his late-night client dinners.



The machine buzzed. The sound dragged her straight back to every other morning-after. 'Eight years of curing his hangover; zero years of curing his wandering eye,' she laughed under her breath. 'Fine. Last batch. Period at the end of the relationship.'



By the time he padded downstairs, the glass was sweating on the counter. He pressed the cold rim to his temple, took a slow sip of the minty honey slush, and didn't offer a word about last night.



""Congrats,"" she said.



""For what?"" He looked up, blank.



""After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait,"" she said calmly.



She had always known about Charlotte. The crush had lasted fifteen years, ever since junior high. On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with Sophia.



'Of course I care.' The thought tasted bitter, but she had loved him enough to play the fool.



Andrew frowned. ""You saw the feed?""



Sophia just looked at him, saying nothing.



""It's PR,"" he said, like he was reading the weather. ""Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.""



She scoffed, ""PR? So you're actually getting a marriage license and throwing a real wedding?""



""Of course,"" he replied. ""Otherwise, my family would never buy it.""



""Then how is that just PR? You're getting married,"" she shot back.



""It's fake, alright? Quit digging,"" he muttered, downing the last of the smoothie and heading upstairs.



""I don't want to referee whatever circus you and Charlotte have going,"" Sophia said, ""but you and I still need to close our books.""



Andrew turned and stared at her. ""Close what books?""



She drew a slow breath. ""We're done. I'm out.""



""Are you even listening?"" he barked. ""The wedding is staged. We'll untie it the second the cameras leave. Why the drama? This doesn't touch you. Just play dumb and wait it out. You need the attention that bad?""



'Have you ever paid any attention to me at all?' The thought stung. ""Real or staged, I'm out,"" she said, voice level. ""We're over, Andrew.""



""Sophia,"" he barked.



""I'm exhausted."" She shut her eyes. ""Eight years of loving you has emptied the tank. That's enough. I'm out.""



""Fine, walk! Just don't come crawling back."" He snatched his coat and slammed the door.



Silence. For the first time, Sophia felt the weight slide off her shoulders and stay gone.



\*\*\*\*\*



Sophia was an OB-GYN at Carter Hospital. She got to her office early and juggled patients while Maggie, the nurse, rattled off the latest gossip.



Maggie sighed, ""So whose baby is Charlotte really carrying? First it was Richard, and now it's Andrew. If it were me, I'd pick Andrew. He's loaded and crazy-hot.



""Plus, he's been hung up on her for fifteen straight years. That's, like, lifetime-movie devotion.""



Sophia couldn't take any more. She told Maggie to take one of the moms-to-be upstairs for her exam.



She'd barely sat down when Andrew called. He demanded, ""Clear your schedule. Charlotte's coming in for her prenatal tomorrow.""



Sophia snapped, ""Rindale's got a dozen OB floors. Why mine? And why me?""



The next morning, Charlotte rolled up anyway.



The second she stepped out of the car, flashbulbs exploded. Hospital security shoved a path through the paparazzi, with Andrew draped over her like a human jacket, and they muscled inside.



Sophia had already pawned the case off on a partner, but Charlotte told the front desk they were ""besties."" Bruce, the hospital director, called and made Sophia do it.



The prenatal checkups were quickly completed, and after reviewing the reports, Sophia confirmed that everything was normal.



""You're ten weeks, three days,"" Sophia said, clicking the mouse. ""First visit, so you need to pick up your prenatal booklet."" She nodded at the wall behind Andrew. ""Instructions are taped right there. Follow the steps.""



Andrew skimmed the sheet and scrunched his nose. ""Can't you do it? I want to stay with Charlotte.""



Sophia looked down. ""Has to be the mom or a family member. It's not part of my job.""



""Come on, Sophia. Charlotte needs me right now. Try to be helpful,"" he said.



""If I run errands for every partner, I'd never deliver a baby,"" Sophia replied.



Andrew's brows furrowed. ""You-""



""Next,"" Sophia called, already looking past him.



Andrew opened his mouth, but Charlotte squeezed his arm. She said, ""Sophia, don't be mad. I'm not trying to hog Andrew.""



Sophia gave her a long, level look.



For fifteen years, Charlotte had kept Andrew on a string, crying ""just friends"" whenever he got too close, then yanking him back the second he tried to walk away.



She'd known all along that Sophia was Andrew's real girlfriend, yet she still soaked up every drop of his love and attention while swearing to everyone that they were nothing more than buddies.



Sophia shrugged. ""He is your fiance. If you want his help, ask him. Why would I care?""



Charlotte's lip trembled. ""Are you two fighting because of me?""



Sophia replied, her voice flat, ""We're not fighting. We're done.""



""But you get this all wrong. He was only trying to help-"" Charlotte insisted.



Sophia cut the air with her hand. ""This is not about you. You didn't break us up, so get over yourself.""



""How dare you talk to Charlotte like that? Apologize,"" Andrew snapped.



Sophia's last thread of patience snapped. ""Out. Both of you. Now.""



\*\*\*\*\*



Andrew filed the complaint right there in the hallway, tapping ""submit"" while she watched.



As soon as they left, she was summoned to Bruce's office.



""You do realize this hospital belongs to Carter Healthcare Group, yeah?"" Bruce asked.



Sophia stayed silent. Of course she did.



""And the two you just pissed off? One is Charlotte, the A-list celebrity, and the other is Andrew, a real Carter."" Bruce stared at her, waiting for the weight of that to sink in.



""So what's your point?"" she asked, hands still in her pockets.



He smacked the desk. ""Do you want to keep working here or not?""



""If I'm getting fired because Andrew threw a tantrum and I wouldn't peck his as$, I'll sue for wrongful termination. Your move,"" she fired back.



""You're young and reckless. That's Andrew Carter. You really think you can go toe-to-toe with him and win?"" he snapped.



""I've got patients waiting,"" she said, hand already on the knob. ""If that's all, I'm going back to work.""



Bruce's voice cracked after her. ""Stop being so stubborn. Charlotte likes your bedside thing. She's too famous to wade through paparazzi, so you're her private OB now. When she calls, you will go to her home, no matter the hour.""



""I will not do it,"" Sophia replied.



He sneered, ""You don't get to say no.""



\*\*\*\*\*



Back in her office, Sophia was a wreck.



'Who exactly crowned Andrew king of my life?' she thought. 'I handed him eight solid years of love, and he just handed my heart back in pieces. Loving him isn't supposed to be some signed permission slip for pain.'



""Booklet's ready."" Andrew dropped it on her desk.



Sophia hadn't expected them to waltz back in without a shred of shame. She snorted, took the folder, and started typing.



""Everything a pregnant woman needs is in there. Read it. I'll jot your next appointment down; don't miss it."" She scribbled the date.



""Charlotte's slammed, and so am I. You'll have to remind me when it's time. I'll bring her,"" Andrew said.



Sophia's pen stopped. ""Sorry, I'm booked solid, and I don't babysit grown-ups' calendars.""



""Charlotte's my concern, so that makes her yours. Just ping me when it's time. No soap opera required,"" he shot back.



""Andrew,"" she said, looking up. The heat in her chest cooled to ice. ""I've told you, we're done. Clear? File all the complaints you want. I treat every patient the same.""



His mouth tightened. For once, he saw steel in her eyes.



""We'll remember that,"" Charlotte said, tugging his hand and giving a sugar-sweet smile. ""Thanks for putting up with us, Sophia.""



""Just doing my job,"" Sophia answered, already back to her screen.



""Then see you later,"" Charlotte said.



""Door's that way,"" Sophia replied, never lifting her gaze.



The second they stood, the door burst open and a pack of paparazzi surged in, phones raised like weapons.



""Charlotte, you and Richard keep 'bumping into' each other at midnight hotels. Still just 'friends'?"" one yelled.



""Andrew, did you pop the question or is this whole thing staged?"" another shouted.



""Charlotte already swore you're only buddies. And now you're getting married? Is that a lie?"" a third barked.



They shoved forward, elbows flying. Andrew curled an arm around Charlotte, taking the hits so she didn't have to.



Security was stuck outside, so Sophia shoved her chair back and waded in, shielding Charlotte.



Andrew spotted her, yanked Charlotte over, and pushed her into Sophia's arms. ""Keep her safe,"" he growled.



Then he spun toward the cameras. ""Out. Now!""



The paparazzi didn't flinch. They surged, lenses first.



One reporter wedged himself next to Charlotte, only to be flattened by the wave behind him. Bodies collided, and a shoulder rammed Charlotte hard.



Sophia lunged in front of her, caught a hip-check from two sides, and cracked her waist on the desk edge. ""Ow!""



Before she could straighten, Andrew yanked Charlotte back, sending Sophia into the corner again. White-hot pain blurred her vision and tears sprang up uninvited.



He never looked down. He just pulled Charlotte close and pecked her hard.



Phones up, flashes popping, tens of thousands glued to the live feed, and still Andrew leaned in like no one else existed, pecking Charlotte soft and slow, like she was the only thing that mattered.



Sophia stood behind them, clutching her bruised side, feeling like a cardboard cutout someone had forgotten to move.



""See? Still think it's fake?"" Andrew barked at the pack of reporters jammed in the door. ""Fine, here's the headline. I've been crazy about Charlotte since seventh grade.



""I asked her out the day we graduated, and I've been hers ever since. Eight years, one girl, no doubts. I'm gonna give her the wedding of the century. Nobody else exists for me.""



The room lost it with cheers, whistles, and camera shutters machine gunning. Then one slow clap cut through the noise. Heads swiveled.



Sophia stood there in her white coat, her short messy hair framing her face. She smiled and then clapped. One, two, three. The crowd followed like sheep, and the applause swelled until it swallowed the hallway whole.



Andrew's eyes flicked to her. Something that might've been guilt twitched across his face.



""Mr. Carter, your devotion's inspiring,"" she said, voice flat. ""Hope the two of you are happy.""



Andrew's jaw tightened. ""Keep the pity,"" he muttered, hauling Charlotte toward the exit. They disappeared into the hallway flashbulbs.



The pack followed, footsteps and questions fading. The office dropped into sudden, hollow silence.



Sophia sank into her chair, palm pressed to her side. She lifted her scrub top and found two fresh bruises blooming dark against her skin.



\*\*\*\*\*



Just before Sophia clocked out, her phone buzzed. A WhatsApp pop-up read: \[Hey, it's Henry.\]



She paused, trying to place the name. She'd only talked to him twice, both calls shorter than a coffee break.



Still, they were supposedly getting married, so she hit Accept. The blank chat stared back, but she couldn't think of a single thing to say.



After a few seconds, she shrugged, closed the app, scooped up her purse, and left.



She had the day shift. So she zipped through the wards, clocked out, and hit the sidewalk while the sky was already navy.



She was thumb-tapping Uber when a black Maybach purred to the curb and the rear window whispered down.



Leon leaned across the seat, grinning like a pup. ""Sophia, Jack's bar opens tonight. He told me to scoop you after the shift. He really wants you there."" Leon punched the word and then snickered.



Jack Foster and Leon Harris had been Andrew's boys since sandbox days, and Sophia liked them too much to bail.



So she shrugged, hopped in, and Leon immediately handed her an ice-cold bottle of water.



""Look, I was at Charlotte's birthday too,"" he said, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Saw the whole circus.""



Sophia took a sip and said nothing. She'd watched the clip, Andrew on one knee, while Leon in the background fist-pumping, yelling ""marry him"" like it was a football game.



Leon winced. ""We do that dumb gag every year. Never thought it was legit. Guess Charlotte shocked all of us when she said yes. Wasn't fair to you, though. Sorry.""



""Thanks for admitting it,"" Sophia said, twisting the cap.



""I mean, Andrew was just trying to protect her,"" Leon added, shrugging.



Sophia raised an eyebrow. ""If you had to pick, Charlotte or me, who's your friend?""



""You, no contest,"" Leon shot back.



She laughed, ""Even if you're lying, I'll take it.""



Leon shook his head. ""Not lying. Known her longer, but I like hanging with you more.""



""Cool. And that's why I'm here in your car. Then new rule: Andrew's name is radio silence. We're done, Leon. Not 'on a break,' done,"" she said.



Leon stuck out his tongue. ""People say crazy stuff when they're mad. You'll un-break up eventually.""



Sophia stared out the window, frowning. 'So he thinks I'm just throwing a tantrum? Cute.'



\*\*\*\*\*



Jack's bar sat at the end of a brick alley in a converted carriage house. Stained glass cast amber light over the oak. A brass clock ticked above a sea captain's portrait. The stone lion fountain trickled outside. The room felt like a secret salon.



Leon pointed her toward the east room and then jogged off to the restroom.



Sophia was reaching for the door when Andrew's voice sliced through the wood. ""Jack, drop it, okay? She's the one throwing her little break-up tantrum, not me.""



Jack exhaled. ""Man, you are the one who messed everything up.""



""Charlotte needed help. Was I supposed to watch her crash and burn?""



""And Sophia?"" Jack asked. ""What about her?""



Andrew snorted, ""Sophia? Please. She doesn't even register next to Charlotte.""



""You're gonna eat those words someday,"" Jack warned.



""Whatever. Every time Charlotte crooks a finger, Sophia freaks out and 'breaks up.' Then she comes crawling back, begging. Same song, different verse. Let her cool her heels. She'll be back,"" Andrew sneered.



Jack's voice dropped. ""You're banking on Sophia's love lasting forever. It won't. Here, take these roses, go fix it before the clock runs out.""



Sophia squared her shoulders, pulled in a slow breath, and shoved the door open.



Jack met her halfway. ""Sophia, so glad you came.""



Since she knew Jack's bar was opening, Sophia arrived with a gift: a polished brass ship's bell. She handed it over. ""Here's to packed tables and zero spilled drinks.""



Jack grinned. ""Appreciate it."" He cut his eyes toward Andrew, and then back to her. ""Grab a seat. I gotta circulate.""



""I'm not staying,"" Sophia said, already turning. ""I'll celebrate with you another night, okay?""



""Soph-"" Jack started.



""Thanks for remembering me, Jack."" She paused long enough to give him a quick, sorry smile. Then she slipped out.



She made it to the door when Andrew came jogging after her. ""You done with the tantrum yet?""



Sophia ignored him and kept walking.



""I already spelled it out. Don't test me,"" he barked, cutting in front of her, impatience written all over his face.



She looked him up and down and let out a short laugh. ""I heard every word in there. I was the idiot who convinced myself I deserved you. My bad. Eight years of stupidity, and I've paid in full. I'm not renewing the subscription.""



She pivoted, but Andrew snatched her wrist. ""You're seriously doing this?""



""Let go,"" she snapped.



His grip tightened, his eyes burning with fury. A second later, he dragged her toward the car like she weighed nothing.



""I'm not getting in,"" she snapped.



""Yes, you are. We're going home,"" he sneered.



""No,"" Sophia shot back.



He smiled, ""Maybe I've been ignoring you too long, letting you think breaking up is an option. Tonight I'll remind you who you still belong to. Two days, Sophia. You won't leave that bed.""

1pcyosb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pcyosb/the_town_that_lost_its_shadow/,THE TOWN THAT LOST IT'S SHADOW,"I didn’t notice at first when the shadows disappeared.

Maybe that sounds strange, but shadows are one of those things you don’t pay attention to unless they’re wrong. You don’t step out of your front door in the morning and say, *Good, my shadow is still here.* You just expect it. Just like you expect your town to function, your neighbors to speak, and air to taste like nothing at all.

It was a Tuesday when the first military trucks rolled into Briar’s Point.

Briar’s Point… God, I haven’t said the name out loud since I left. Even thinking it feels like peeling a scab off something that hasn't finished bleeding.

I remember wiping down the counter at my gas station—McCready’s Fuel & More, named after my father—when the rumble came through the front windows. I thought it was the quarry blasting again. But the sound didn’t stop. It kept coming, and then the first green-painted truck crawled into view like a beetle the size of a house.

Then another.  
And another.  
And another.

I stepped outside, rag still in my hand. The air tasted metallic.

The trucks didn’t have any insignia I recognized. Not Army. Not National Guard. Just a black rectangle painted on the doors, blank as a closed eye.

People gathered on the sidewalks—Bud from the hardware store, Mrs. Langley clutching her dog, some kids on bikes. We all watched, confused but curious. That’s how small towns are: curiosity comes before fear.

Then the soldiers got out.

They wore gear that looked military but… different. No name tags. No flag patches. Their helmets were smooth, opaque, featureless, like someone had dipped their heads in obsidian. They moved like synchronized clockwork—same step, same posture, same silence.

A man stepped forward. Pale. Tall. His uniform had the same blank rectangle.

“I am Captain Hale,” he said, his voice too calm, too measured. “By federal order, Briar’s Point is now under temporary operational control. Please remain in your homes until further notice.”

Someone laughed. I think it was Bud.  
“Under whose order?” he asked. “What agency?”

Captain Hale smiled without showing his teeth.

“That information is classified.”

That was when the fear started, everyone turned away and walked back inside their homes or business as if someone or something flipped a switch in their brains.

They announced a curfew that evening—8 p.m. sharp. It wasn’t a suggestion. The speakers they set up on every corner crackled to life every hour with Hale’s voice, smooth as mercury.

“Remain indoors. Do not approach the perimeter. Do not engage with personnel.”

The sun sank behind Briar Ridge and the whole town seemed to hold its breath. Only the soldiers moved—patrolling in perfect, mirrored formations. They didn’t talk. Didn’t seem to look around. Just moved.

I stayed at the gas station office instead of going home. My place out on Sycamore Road was too far from people, and I didn’t want to be alone. I kept the lights low, sat behind the counter, and tried to read, but the words wouldn’t stay still.

At about ten, someone knocked.

Not on the door.  
but on the window.

I jumped hard enough to spill coffee across the counter, ""crap"" I muttered I looked up from the counter toward the window and saw it the shape outside was small but recognizable it was Mrs. Langley’s dog, Charlie, staring in at me through the glass. His head was cocked, tail between his legs.

“Jesus, Charlie,” I whispered, getting up and moving toward the door.

The moment I unlocked it and turned the nob to open it up Charlie bolted *past* me, whining. He hid beneath the counter, shaking violently, I knelt and scratched behind his ears.

“What’s wrong, buddy?” I said still whispering as if I did not want whatever spooked him to spook me next.

That was when I noticed something strange,

His shadow, or rather its **absence**.

The light from the ceiling shined directly above him illuminating the entirety of the gas station interior he should’ve been casting something, even a faint smear. But the floor was empty.

I stood up slowly, my throat tight.

“Charlie… where’s your—”

He jerked suddenly, letting out a noise I’d never heard from a dog. His paws scrabbled on the tile, claws clicking as his legs stretched unnaturally, his spine arched like someone was pulling it up from inside, his jaw unhinged slightly—not wide enough to be grotesque, but enough that something was fundamentally wrong.

I stumbled back not taking my eyes off Charlie,

then a sharp knock at the door broke the sound of cracking bones and unnatural whines a knock that made me do a full 360 while still kneeling where Charlie once was.

There in the doorway of the gas station stood a soldier. He pointed at Charlie, I shook my head. “No. He’s not—”

The soldier pointed again this time walking inside making me stop mid-sentence.

I stepped in front of the dog now standing face to face with the solider “He belongs to Mrs. Langley. I’m not—”

The soldier’s visor tilted, and for the first time I saw something reflected in it. Something that made me stop mid-sentence yet again, it was not my face, not the room we were all standing in, but it was something else, something moving.

“Turn over the asset,” the soldier said now breaking the awkward silence.

“Asset?” I whispered.

Charlie let out a groan from somewhere behind me that made my skin crawl.

The soldier took a step forward—

Then another soldier appeared, placing a hand on the first one’s shoulder. They both turned away at the same time, perfectly synchronized, and walked off into the darkness.

No explanation. No warning.

Just gone.

Charlie stopped shaking… but he didn’t go back to normal. He stared at the door with eyes that didn’t look entirely like his anymore.

That was when I realized something was deeply, wrong with Briar’s Point.

The next morning, without explanation, the curfew lifted as the sun creeped over the ridge.

People crawled out of their houses cautiously, like animals checking for predators. The soldiers stood at intersections, unmoving.

At noon, Captain Hale assembled the entire town in the high school gymnasium.

We all climbed into the bleachers as instructed by Captain Hale while the soldiers lined up against the walls.

Hale stepped onto the stage with a smile too polished to be real.

“Briar’s Point,” he began. “Your cooperation is appreciated in this difficult time, our operations are proceeding smoothly, and to maintain transparency, I will provide basic guidance.”

Transparency, right I thought to myself as he continued on.

“As you have noticed, certain anomalies have occurred in your community.”  
His eyes swept the room. “These anomalies are the reason for our presence here in your town of Briar's Point.”

Hale was about to continue when someone yelled from the back cutting him off, “What anomalies?”

Hale didn’t blink, “The kind that compromise physical law.”

Murmurs rippled across the crowd as he said this.

He continued.  
“Last week, satellite surveillance detected a rupture event beneath Briar Point along the ridge to be more precise”

“Rupture?” Mrs. Langley whispered near me.

“A spatial breach,” Hale clarified, tone colder now. “Something crossed through. Something we have been tracking.”

He paused.

“And it is still in your town.”

A chill crept up my spine.

“The entity has the ability,” Hale said carefully, “to detach a living being from its shadow.”

My heart dropped as I thought about last night, Charlie.

“A person—or animal—whose shadow has been severed becomes compromised,” Hale continued. “Unstable even dangerous to themselves and others.”

He scanned our faces as he continued.

“If you observe a missing shadow or any unusual behavior, report it immediately. Do not attempt to interact, do not attempt to help. We will contain it.”

Mrs. Langley clutched my arm.

“My dog—” she whispered, voice trembling. “Have you seen Charlie?”

I swallowed hard.

Hale ended the meeting with one final statement:

“This operation will conclude when the entity has been identified and secured. Until then, trust your military you're all dismissed.”

Something about the way he said all of that made my stomach twist into knots.

Over the next few days, the people of Briars Point started acting strange.

Old man Heller wandered into the post office naked from the waist up, babbling on about how the sun was “hollowing him out.”  
Teenagers reported “shapes” walking behind them that didn’t match their steps.  
At night, I heard scraping sounds on rooftops, followed by low humming that vibrated in my teeth.

Shadows began to behave… incorrectly.  
Some stretched in the wrong direction.  
Some flickered as if caught in wind that wasn’t there.  
Some split from the person all together.

The soldiers intensified their patrols and presence especially around the ridge.

Before long things escalated,

Three days after the briefing, Mrs. Langley found Charlie under her bed—not moving, but very much alive. His fur had changed texture, like static electricity was crawling under his skin. When she tried to call the soldiers, Charlie lunged. She slammed the bedroom door shut and fled into the street, screaming.

Soldiers arrived within minutes.

We all heard the gunshots.

But we didn’t hear Charlie.

No barking. No howling. Nothing.

Just silence.

After that, curfew became 6 p.m. and as usual we were left with little to no update.

On the fifth night, Captain Hale knocked on the door of the gas station where I’d been living sense everything began.

I considered not answering but ignoring someone like Hale felt like tempting God himself.

So, I opened it.

He took a second as if to look me up and down before he finally took a deep breath and stepped inside, soldiers flanking him on every side as he did.

“You’ve interacted with the anomaly,” Hale said calmly.

My mouth went dry. “What anomaly?”

“Mrs. Langley’s animal.”

I swallowed again harder this time, “I didn’t know” I said words getting half stuck in my throat as I spoke.

Hale lifted a handheld device shaped like a tuning fork. Its prongs glowed faintly.

“You may be compromised,” he said a look of concern washing over his face.

My chest tightened as he said this. “I’m fine I swear” I said allowing a cold sweat to run across my head.

“People exposed to the entity often say that, so please forgive me if I do not believe you"" he said now locking eyes with me.

He held out the fork, placing it to my forehead like it was a thermomotor and he was checking my temperature “Remain still.” he said now sounding calmer than before.

The device vibrated gently.

Then it stopped.

Hale looked almost… disappointed.

“You’re clear,” he said. “For now.”

“For now?” I asked.

“The entity adapts.”  
He stepped closer, lowering his voice. “If you see anything unusual… tell me directly. Not my soldiers. Me.”

He slipped a card into my hand.

It was blank—white as bone. No number. No name.

“What is this?”

“A key,” he said.

Then he left.

I stared at the card long after he was gone.

It absorbed the light around it, but it never seemed to change.

I found myself soon fast asleep when a violent, sudden downpour that rattled the windows like fists jolted me awake.

I sat up looking at the clock as I did 1:14 a.m. ""ugh can this get any worse"" I said out loud letting my head fall back on to the pillow. And then it happened as if I was living in some cliche horror movie the power went out.

Normally, a blackout in Briar’s Point wasn’t anything to panic about. But this time, the darkness felt wrong. Like it had weight.

I grabbed a flashlight and stepped into the station’s main room, as I did my attention focused outside the glass windows of the station, shapes moved outside, not soldiers, not animals, but something else.

I locked the door instinctively, the flashlight flickered, buzzing like insects were crawling through the wires. The beam stretched unnaturally long across the floor and stopping at the door frame, bending in ways it was never meant to.

Then—footsteps behind me.

Slow, wet, deliberate, I turned slowly allowing the light to move with me a shadow stood in the corner, but it wasn’t mine, it was tall twice my height with limbs too thin to hold a body. It had no face, no edges. It was a cutout of darkness that shifted like smoke trapped underwater.

Then it stepped forward. My chest seized, I lifted the flashlight, and it *laughed*, not aloud but inside my head, like someone was whispering in my skull.

“Not… you,” the voice murmured, silky and disjointed. “Not… yet.”

It moved toward the window, its shape smearing against the glass, like oil spreading across water as it moved through it.

Outside, soldiers were speaking in static short bursts of radio distortion instead of words. Some of them marched straight into the dark figure. When they touched it, they froze… and their shadows peeled off the ground like sheets of wet paper, rising to join the figure.

I don’t fully remember what I did next, screamed maybe even prayed to what god still existed.

Almost everyone was sheltering in the high school gym at this point as it was honestly the only place the soldiers had fortified with real effort floodlights, steel doors, and barricades.

When I arrived, soaked and shaking, the soldiers let me in without a word.

Inside, the townspeople were huddled in blankets. Children cried, adults whispered rumors as to what could be going on.

Then Hale stepped onto the stage again, only this time, he didn’t look polished. His eyes were bloodshot, his uniform was torn, and his shadow… twitched.

“The breach entity is active,” he announced. “Remain calm. We are securing the perimeter.”

Someone shouted from the back seeming to catch Hale off guard, “You said you could contain this!”

Hale didn’t answer, he gripped the podium, knuckles white, “The entity has taken new form,” he said. “It can replicate, It can”

His shadow jerked violently, stretching across the stage.

Then it rose up from Hale's body as if it was breaking its tie to him, we screamed as we ran, Hale didn’t even have time to react, the shadow wrapped around him like a black coil and yanked him backward. He hit the ground hard, convulsing.

Soldiers opened fire on the shadow as the building cleared out but the bullets passed through and started embedding themselves into the wall.

The overhead lights flickered as this happened and eventually went out altogether.

Chaos erupted as the school was now a pitch-black void seemingly swallowing all who could not run fast enough to break its grip.

People pushed, shoved, ran blindly. Something cold brushed my neck—thin fingers tracing my spine. I ran without thinking, following a strip of emergency glow tape on the floor.

I don’t know how many people died in those ten minutes. I never went back to count.

All I know is that when I burst through the emergency exit into the rain, only a handful of others made it out with me.

The rest…

God help them all.

The soldiers were broken in the days that followed, some wandering aimlessly, while others fired into corners where nothing stood. Their helmets were cracked, visors shattered. Their shadows moved independently around their bodies.

The entity had infected everything it touched.

I remembered what Hale had given me, the blank card, a key no doubt but a key to what?

I ran toward the perimeter, toward the road out of town. A massive barricade blocked the highway, with a small control panel on the side.

My hands shook as I touched the blank card to it.

The panel beeped as the card made contact with the panel turning all the lights on it green.

The barricade opened, behind me, something roared, not with sound, but it came from the ground itself, vibrating the bones beneath my skin. The asphalt buckled as I stood on top of it watching it crumble away, dark shapes crawled toward me, flickering in and out of existence, like they were stitched from pieces of other people’s silhouettes.

I sprinted through the gap and didn't look back. Didn’t even breathe, just ran, ran like my life depended on it.

When I crossed the county line, the shadows behind me dissolved like mist, I took one look back at the town I once called home the sun was just beginning to rise and the world looked normal, but Briar’s Point…  
Well Briar’s Point was gone\*\*, as if the town never existed at all\*\*, all that was left was the mist and collapsed road of where a town once sat.

It’s been seven months, and I move constantly, motels, bus stations, friend-of-a-friend couches. I sleep with the light on, every light I can find. People think I’m paranoid, maybe I am, but sometimes, at the edge of vision, I see shapes that don’t match mine. Glimpses of movement where no one stands, and sometimes, when I close my eyes, I hear Charlie growling, and Hale whispering, and even the entity laughing.

Last night, I finally worked up the courage to check, and under the bright bathroom lights of a cheap motel, I stood in front of the mirror and looked down at my feet.

A shadow met my glance my shadow…

And I swear when I looked hard enough, I could have sworn it blinked, only once, a tiny ripple, like a wink but it was enough, enough to tell me this was not over, enough to tell me that they are waiting, waiting for the day I return.....",1,1764749885.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1pcyogr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1pcyogr/it_sucks_that_so_many_business_here_dont_allow/,It sucks that so many business here don't allow any returns/exchanges,"I bought a stove, and two hoods from SMEG for a total of 600,000 pesos. So, one could argue that I'm a decent SMEG customer already.

However, I received a coffee machine as a gift (worth 50,000 pesos), and I simply asked if I could exchange it for another type of machine. The machine is literally unused and in the original box. I didn't touch it, and I didn't even ask for a refund (just an exchange). But SMEG said they offer zero returns/exchanges. Why is it like that here?

Anyways, I get it that small businesses might suffer from the government passing a law requiring returns/exchanges, but I feel like something should be passed here to at least cover the larger businesses. They can afford to do it, and the consumers are not being protected. And I'm not talking about returning a sofa to Costco after using it for a year. That's crazy. I can't believe Costco does that. But not allowing an exchange on a unused/unopened item that was only bought 2-3 days ago is equally extreme.",4,1764749852.0,Philippines_Expats,22,0.64,False
