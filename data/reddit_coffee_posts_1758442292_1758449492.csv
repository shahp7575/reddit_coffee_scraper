I want to make a flavoring for periodic use in my weekend coffee. I used to make a simple syrup-type solution (water+sugar+spices then filter), but that now on the naughty list. I don't want to use any of the fake sugars and sweetness is not a priority for me.

On first principles, it stands that I could make the same extraction/  solution of spices and boiling water w/o sugar (i.e., tea). I don't think the addition of the sugar makes the water any more polar/a stronger solvent. It won't have the viscosity of a syrup, but that is unimportant. I should be able to get the same flavor profile, minus the sweetness, right? I grasp I could make an ethanol-based extraction too, but I'm holding off on that for the moment.

1nmo39i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmo39i,Altered mouth taste and bad breath from bad gut health or something else?,"Hi!

Have been dealing with these symptoms for a year and a half since treatment of H.Pylori. I feel like I've been doing all the right things and yet my symptoms are not improving at all so I'm wondering if there might be another cause? I'm at my wits end with this because it's really ruining my life

After numerous Doctor and specialist visits to try and sort this out to no avail, I finally got a GI map done in May this year through a naturopath. She put me on a treatment protocol which involved changing my diet and adding in supplements.

This diet is only whole foods, nothing processed (inc. bread, pasta, etc) and no sugar at all. Basically, all I eat is fruit, vegetables, legumes, rice, quinoa, oats, tea, coffee, nuts, seeds, kefir, fermented vegetables and yoghurt. Resistant starches (cooked and cooled rice or potatoes) and polyphenol rich foods (green tea, berries, nuts, seeds). The only processed food I eat is protein powder (brand I use is a mix of Pea Protein, Fava Bean Protein, Rice Protein). I do not eat meat or dairy, haven’t for 7 years.

Other notes:

* I don’t drink or smoke
* Regular medication is iron and b12, have switched brands over the 1.5 years with no improvement
* Altered taste is not there when I eat and doesn’t change the taste of food
* My dental health is perfect, my dentist is also at a loss about these symptoms
* No foods seem to make the taste worse, other than sugar which significantly worsens it
* It's hard to describe the taste because I've had it for so long, sometimes it's metallic, sometimes it's sour, sometimes it feels like my tongue is burnt

The supplements she has me taking are: 

* Partially hydrolysed guar gum
* 2x [OmegAvail](https://betahealth.com.au/products/dfh-omegavail-1250?_pos=1&_sid=579dc904b&_ss=r) (fish oil)
* 2x [IntestaSelect](https://betahealth.com.au/products/orthoplex-intestaselect?srsltid=AfmBOorZa0xRe1bZmQpZwstwRDVIkQKb9yAv7aJcx58p69jmSD-y9mH1)
* 1x [Gut-R ](https://betahealth.com.au/products/orthoplex-gut-r?_pos=5&_sid=2f00bb72f&_ss=r)(glutamine and zinc carnosine) 
* 2x Floramyces (500 mg Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Boulardii))

1nmo0kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MinoxidilSideEffects/comments/1nmo0kj/this_shit_os_poison/,This shit os poison,"
Minoxidil is poison. You can find lots of posts about this – that it causes drowsiness, that coffee stops working. People who don’t really use their brains, who don’t study or learn anything, for example a foreign language, often don’t notice it. But if you do intellectual work, you’ll quickly realize that things get worse.

Recently I talked to a guy who claimed he had no side effects and had been using minoxidil for half a year. I asked him if he wasn’t sleepy and tired. And he said, well actually, yes, I am sleepy and tired. Even coffee stopped working. At the gym I feel weaker, but I thought I just had a drop in form.

The problem is that minoxidil accumulates and you stop connecting these side effects with minoxidil itself. And to reverse them, it often takes even a few months. So don’t listen to those who say it has no side effects – people are so desperate to keep their hair that they’ll even get used to a lower quality of life. Minoxidil is poison.

And what do we always hear?

“It’s definitely not minoxidil, it must be something else. You’re paranoid, you’re overthinking"". Except that before, you didn’t have these problems, and plenty of people write that when they stop using this crap, the problems start to go away..

every rose has its thorns. And many say minoxidil is only effective for up to 2 years..

This crap is toxic for everyone, not everyone notices it. Some people cope bette, others worse. But even those who don’t notice it will, after quitting, start to realize that their concentration and quality of life begin to improve

I’d love to know from this community:
	•	What kind of brewing equipment would you be excited to see readily available? (Think V60s, Aeropress, moka pots, grinders, filters, scales, etc.)
	•	What sort of beans/roasts would you want to pick up? (Everyday drinkers, limited origins, blends, decaf, experimental lots?)
	•	Anything else you wish was easier to find locally?

1nmnxgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nmnxgs/this_is_my_story_distancing_himself_but_still/,This is my story: distancing himself but still “wants me.”,"Met a guy at a concert I went to with my mom. There were guys that kept getting close and I would move back, I guess he was watching from behind me, so he pulled me close back to my mom again. I looked at him, said thank you, then he kept initiating small convos after that. He would give me compliments and I would just laugh in a way like I didn’t believe it and say thank you. Lastly, he asked for my insta then took my number cuz he doesn’t use his insta. I normally don’t give my number out but idk what happened to me. I think that we’re from different countries and he really had no way of knowing anything about me (including my last name) unless I gave it to him appealed to me at first?

We’re both from different religions and countries so it was made clear that a long term commitment is impossible. He’s only here to complete his studies for 2 years then he’s going back to his country. I only date to marry and have never really been in serious relationship nor a relationship/situationship for that long (3+months). He’s only been in one serious relationship from when he was younger but they didn’t end up getting married.

We talked for 4 months straight like we were in constant contact over messages or calls. I would tell him we need to stop when he would ask to move up in the relationship but he kept coming back and I honestly would miss him so much that I would respond the second he texted after we would “end things.” I remember the first time we agreed to end it he didn’t reach out for 3 days and I literally felt like my soul had left my body, it was very painful. I’ve never felt so comfortable with someone, and the way he talked to me I would feel it in my body. He found me at a time where I was moving chapters in my life (moving out, new school, leaving work). I also have lost touch with my friends (my fault but they also weren’t real friends). I was very happy with my life though and the transition I was going to be making. However, he opened my heart, made me feel like I’m capable/worthy of loving and being loved, made me fall in love with love again. It was nice having someone care about me and being there for me. I felt like a little girl with him and he would treat me that way. I gave him so much of my thought and time though (I’m normally like that a giver to those i love and let in my life). Im either all in or nothing that’s why when i fall I fall hard ;/

After around first month, he would start arguments because he wanted more than just texting/calling he wanted to see me and I didn’t want that. He would say that he misses me and it’s normal everyone here goes out on dates… though this isn’t normal for his country especially. I was trying to protect both of us from creating memories that will eventually lead to heartache and I didn’t want the relationship to develop. I kept telling him I’m fine with just talking as friends but nothing more or else we can just end the relationship if he’s no longer happy (which is what we agreed to the first week after we found out the religious differences). He never saw me just as a friend and honestly I fell for him too(bcz his confidence when he asked for my number in person, his calmness, and the way he cared and was prioritizing me) but I didn’t want to be playing his heart and I would keep telling/reminding him like we both know this isn’t going anywhere…etc. not realizing how much it’ll hurt me too eventually. I didn’t want to get drifted after our feeling but unfortunately here I am

P.s. not out of arrogance but mostly everyone I see/meet make very positive remarks about me and my looks. So the issue is not that I lack in looks, confidence, education,… it’s just me and personal life circumstances that made me close up on myself. He also makes remarks about my “beauty” and physical appearance. Sometimes I feel like that’s the only reason that makes him treat me the way he does and why he “doesn’t want to lose me,” although he’ve said no and got upset when I insinuated that he likes me for my looks (although this is my worst nightmare bcz I’ve always wanted someone to see more in me like be drawn to something deeper than my looks). 

After the 4 months he went back to his country to see his family and the 1st month he would constantly contact me over txt. Towards the end of that 1st month he started txting me at the end of his day and he would just ask the same few questions and then would want to sleep. I started feeling a change in his eagerness/energy towards me like feeling neglected and I would tell him don’t feel obligated to talk to me out of habit or whatever only talk to me when you actually want to bcz I wasn’t feeling like he was reaching out out of eagerness to learn about my day or w/e. I was just missing him constantly and our old connection I guess. He started growing a bit distant like going a day without reaching out then couple days, etc. We had yet another argument and he said how he’s always been the one to reach out and stuff and I told him that it’s not true I also reached out a few times (but he’s at his family’s and I’m not sure of his circumstances there so I didn’t want to be bothering him) & let him know he never communicated this issue to me before. So after that I reached out and I let him know that I miss him a lot and we txtd for a bit then he went MIA for 2 1/2 hrs only to see that he posted a sc story. I got very upset, especially because I had really wanted to talk to him only to see him ignoring me straight up like that, and I blocked him. Removed block after week+. He tried txting. I ended it with a txt and wouldn’t respond after that. No contact for over a month, close to 2. I was going through a lot health wise. So I responded to his last text and he called me and I spent it talking about my issues and everything I was going through. So all his worries vanished ofcourse and I ended up not teaching him the lesson I wanted him to learn about ignoring me when I want to talk to him.

Now he’s in a different state for his school and he’s only growing more distant, it’s like he only wants to talk to me at his convenience but when I want to talk to him he’s never there (he knows this and summed it in his own words when I was telling him about what’s bothering me) so he knows exactly what he’s doing and what’s bothering me. The issue is he won’t let me be, he keeps reaching out when I try to end things and move on but he also doesn’t want any sort of responsibility or commitment it seems. He said when he’s not comfortable it shows on him and he doesn’t need to talk to me 24hrs that he loves his family but he doesn’t talk to them every day… when he used to take all my time and want to talk to me every minute. I responded with “ whatever, I don’t care” it’s not about talking 24hrs it’s about how it’s only at his convenience. I was lying though, I did want more communication from him, going over 2-3days of no communication was hurting me, he broke my heart, I didn’t want to ask someone I care about to talk to me, let alone the only person I actually like talking to and want to talk to, I felt belittled and I hadn’t even had asked him for more communication, I want it to come from him. He just said he hasn’t been comfortable since he got here blah blah but that his feelings are still the same regardless of communication and he’s still him. The distance after that 1st call (after having gone 1+ month without communication) was killing me again though, bcz it’s like all my feelings just came back right after I heard his voice and his support. I like miss him crazy I’ve never felt like this before it’s daunting/draining. I’m seriously in love with him and I just love hearing his voice.

Now, I’ve told him I’m going on a trip and can’t communicate with him for a month (since he’s been growing distant). I need to get back to myself and try to get him out of mind somehow. The longing for him has been affecting me though especially not having anything significant to take my mind off him. I don’t know what to do. Every day I feel like texting him that I love him. ChatGPT has been good at holding me back. He’s always on my mind. I really liked him being in my life but now knowing he’s not really there for me whenever or when I need him hurts because I was always there for him. Please let me know what y’all think about this or what I should do. Both me and him are in our late 20s. It’s even worse that I can’t talk about him to anyone because our differences 
;( Any advice/ideas/suggestions? 
I was thinking of telling him I met someone over the trip and want to give him a chance hoping that will stop him from communicating or just keep telling him that I don’t want to talk if he reaches out again. Idk. 

*I didn’t keep him blocked bcz I don’t like to block anyone as in have unfinished business. I don’t like the idea of blocking someone forever I like to set things straight and move on. (Everything with him has been an exception though I normally 1000% stick to my decisions) 
I’ve met him twice after the concert, once over coffee cuz I had interview in his area and another he came to my city so we can say bye before his travel (he invited me for dinner but I paid (lmk if this was a mistake on my end)). ",1,1758448403.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1nmntxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nmntxq/aitah_for_being_mad_after_my_boyfriend_asked_for/,AITAH for being mad after my boyfriend asked for more money from my boss?,"Hello everyone, I came here to get a reality check and find out whether I am overreacting my rather unimportant problem, any opinion on this is welcome.

So I have been working for this really small company for over a year now, there are only five permanent employees currently, I have been here the longest and have a great relationship with my bosses (the two guys who founded the company). Since we are always short-staffed, we sometimes ask friends and family to help out during events, for a bit of money of course. It's usually nothing special, greating guests and offering coffee to presenters occasionally.

Last year, for a similar event that lasted 2 days and was quite popular, I asked my friend to come and help out - for this, she has received 60$ and a fancy meal which is considered quite good for a gig in my country. She had a lot to do but my bosses were grateful for her help so noone complained about it.

Yesterday, we had another, smaller scale event that was not as succesful as anticipated. My previously mentioned friend was not available so I asked my boyfriend who is currently unemployed to help us out - I promised him 30$ since this is for one day only. He said it is fine. Next day I am talking with my boss and he asks what I had promised him, I say 30$ based on last year. He offeres to pay him 60$ for one day since he is family and currently in a roughspot, which I was grateful for. Most. emloyers I know would have accepted the original amount since the we did not anticipate so many guests to the event anyway. I told my boyfriend, jokingly said I ""haggled"" and got him a better deal which he was happy with.

Now, yesterday evening my boyfriend was pulled aside by my boss and was asked how much I had promised him for this. He said 76$ - this number was not mentioned between neither of us, ever. My boss was of course suprised (since he knew how much we have talked about) but paid him anyway saying that if this is how much his time is worth he is okay with it. Later, we went out for a reaally pricey dinner to where they invited my boyfriend too because of some cancellations. The company pays. We don't eat a lot but I did offer to pay for our meals. The topics of money came up and my boss jokingly said that since he was already ripped of by my boyfriend today he might let me. I didn't understand so on the way home I asked my boyfriend what happened. He told me that he said 76$ because he was expecting my boss to haggle and he was afraid that if he said a lower number than 60$ he would have been given that.

I got angry because this made me look like I was saying different things to him behind the companies back. This was also the first time they have met him in person - if I say he was saying this without my knowledge he is going to be painted in a bad light and he might not be invited to future events. He said that he did say more to help our financial situation. however, I want to be someone whose word worths more than money.

 Am I overreacting? That 15$ is not that much money but I feel that him being greedy like this paints us both in a bad light. I am also thinking about giving the money back (bf would be okay with it, we did talk it over last night), but he says that I should not stress so much over 15$.",2,1758448035.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1nmnt9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1nmnt9t/i_f23_found_my_femboy_colleagues_m21_instagram/,I (F23) Found My Femboy Colleague’s (M21) Instagram and Now We’re Dating,"Hi Reddit! I’ve been dying to share this story because it’s been such a sweet and unexpected journey, and I’m still pinching myself over how it all unfolded. Sorry if this gets long, I’m just so excited to talk about it.
So, a bit of background: I (F23) work at a small marketing firm, and about six months ago, we hired this super shy, quiet guy (M21, let’s call him Alex, not his real name for privacy reasons). Alex is the kind of person who keeps to himself but is always polite and great at his job. We’d chat a bit at work—mostly about projects or random office stuff—but nothing too deep. I always thought he was cute in a soft, nerdy way, but I didn’t think much of it at first.
One night, I was scrolling Instagram and stumbled across this gorgeous femboy account on my explore page. The person was rocking pastel skirts, cute makeup, and oversized sweaters. I was obsessed with their vibe—confident, playful, and radiating positivity. I ended up following the account because their content was so wholesome and fun, like aesthetic selfies and outfit posts.
Fast forward a couple of weeks, and I’m at work when Alex and I are paired up on a project. We’re chatting during a coffee break, and he mentions something about loving pastel colors. It clicked in my brain, and I jokingly asked if he was into fashion or cosplay. His face turned bright red, and he mumbled something about “liking to experiment with style.” I didn’t push it, but my curiosity got the better of me.
That night, I went back to that femboy Instagram account and looked closer. The locations in some posts looked familiar—like the park near our office and a café we all go to sometimes. Then I saw a story with a hoodie I swear I’d seen Alex wear before. My jaw dropped. I was like, “No way, is this Alex?” I didn’t want to creep or make him uncomfortable, so I kept it to myself, but I started paying more attention to him at work.
A few weeks later, we were working late together, and I decided to take a chance. I casually mentioned that I followed this “really cool Instagram account” with femboy fashion and asked if he was into that kind of style. He froze for a second, then laughed nervously and admitted it was his account. I told him I thought his posts were amazing and that he looked so confident and happy in them. He was embarrassed but also seemed relieved that I wasn’t weird about it. We ended up talking for hours that night—about his love for fashion, how he started exploring his style, and how nervous he was about people at work finding out.
From there, we kept getting closer. We started grabbing coffee together, then dinners, and eventually, he asked me out on a proper date. I said yes, obviously. We’ve been dating for about two months now, and it’s been the most wholesome thing. Alex is so sweet and thoughtful—he’ll surprise me with little handwritten notes or bring me my favorite snacks when I’m stressed at work. He’s opened up a lot about his femboy side, and I love how confident he’s gotten. Last weekend, we went shopping together, and I helped him pick out a new skirt and some hair clips. Seeing him light up when he tried them on was adorable.
One of my favorite moments was when we had a cozy movie night at my place. He showed up in an oversized hoodie and thigh-high socks, and we cuddled up with popcorn and watched Studio Ghibli films. He kept apologizing for being “extra,” but I told him I love every part of him—his shy work side, his femboy side, all of it. He got teary-eyed and said no one’s ever made him feel so accepted before.
I’m posting this because I’m so happy and didn’t expect to find someone so special in such a random way. Has anyone else had a cute, unexpected love story like this? Or any tips for keeping things wholesome and supportive in a new relationship? I want to make sure Alex always feels safe and loved for being himself.

On one hand, I know I like the conical profile, especially for milk drinks. On the other hand… FOMO about that flat burr magic everyone raves about. I get it’s like justify between apple and bananas — both tasty, just different. That’s why it’s so hard.

DF54 feels like a cheaper first step into flat burrs because it’s still producing cups that differ from conical burrs, while J-Ultra is focused and will def give me all the conical goodies. I don’t want to overspend on first gear either, not knowing if my husband will even join me in this espresso rabbit hole.

1nmnox1,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1nmnox1/poured_coffe_beans_into_the_chute_meant_for/,Poured coffe beans into the chute meant for pre-ground coffe,"Hi everyone,

I made a mistake with my De'Longhi Magnifica S – I accidentally poured whole coffee beans into the chute meant for pre-ground coffee. I then turned the machine on (not realizing the mistake yet).

During the process, I heard some beans falling inside the machine. Machine started shaking and making weird noises. After realizing what happened, I opened it up and checked:

	⁃	The pre-ground coffee chute is now empty.

	⁃	I was able to remove a few beans that had fallen to the bottom of the machine (near the drip tray area).

	⁃	I removed the brew unit, and it came out normally – nothing looks jammed or broken.

I didn’t turn on the machine since, I'm worried some beans might be stuck somewhere deeper in the machine where I can’t see them. 

Does anyone know what could have happened inside the machine, or what I should check next to make sure everything is okay?

I work as a barista, and it's so stressful to the point where I've cried multiple times on the floor within the past week. It's frankly my manager's fault. Not only is my manager too critical, but they are also too slow at hiring (which I understand that you can't just hire anyone), but we're so incredibly understaffed, especially since our store is the only large chain coffee store in the area. No one in my store likes them, especially the shift leads. The manager is horrible with scheduling and frankly does not consider the other baristas' feelings. Yesterday morning I was incredibly nauseous, and threw up twice before deciding to call in sick. I didn't have any sick time, and no one could cover my shift (which I understand, it's not their fault I was sick). I had to show up and was literally miserable, but I sobbed for about half an hour before I started getting ready for work. The problem is, I don't think I can quit. For the most part, I need money. I live in an incredibly small town with literally no one hiring. I'm about to turn 18 in a week, and so I need to save up to be able to move out, away from this town. I've only been working at this location for a month and a half, and I'm miserable. I've slipped back into a really bad depression episode, and don't do anything except work, sleep, and school. The days blur together, and overall, my mental health is getting worse by the day. I've been trying to look for remote jobs, or maybe even jobs in the town over, but every job I find pays way less than the one I have currently, and they're at least thirty minutes of a drive, if not more. I suppose I could just suck it up for another year and wait to move to university, but I genuinely can't stand going to that horrid place.

1nmnkp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1nmnkp9/delve_into_whether_vok_trash_bags_truly_handle/,Delve Into Whether VOK Trash Bags Truly Handle Daily Waste,"Testing the VOK TBMSXYC01, I wanted to see if a small trash bag could effectively combine strength, durability, and convenience in a compact package. My life is a mixture of chaos and order—on one hand, a house bustling with kids who throw everything into the first wastebasket they see, and on the other, an obsessive need for cleanliness and functionality. The VOK TBMSXYC01 presents itself with bold claims of being leak-proof, durable, and eco-friendly. I decided to put these colorful 4-gallon drawstring trash bags through their paces in my bathroom, office, and even my car to see if they can stand up to daily use.

**Compact Dimensions with Convenient Drawstring Handles**  
Given its compact size of 17.7 inches by 15.7 inches, the trash bag is just right for small spaces like bathrooms and office wastebaskets. I appreciated the drawstring feature, which cleverly avoids the annoyance of having to touch the trash while closing or carrying the bag. My favorite part? The drawstrings grip the wastebasket tightly, keeping everything snug and in place. There was a moment when one of my kids tossed orange juice remains into the bathroom bin—no leaks or spills in sight. Considering how convenient it makes disposing of messy waste, I can see why the drawstring handles are a standout feature.  

[Check VOK TBMSXYC01 price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0f4dfzkrf/)  

**Durability and Strength Under Pressure**  
I was skeptical of the strength claimed by a ""small trash bag,"" but these bags are made of High-Density Polyethylene, which clearly adds robustness. From wet, gooey leftovers to heavier bathroom waste like empty shampoo bottles, the bags held up exceptionally well. Over two weeks of testing, there wasn’t a single tear or leak—not even when overloaded with heavier contents. That’s a major plus if you’ve ever dealt with trash bags failing at the worst moments. Still, I wouldn’t recommend trying to overstuff them beyond reasonable expectations for a 4-gallon bag.

**Eco-Friendly Alternative with Unscented Freshness**  
For an environmentally conscious household like mine, the bags' eco-friendly and unscented nature stood out. I’m always wary with scented products, as they can be overpowering or clash with other fragrances in a room. These had a subtle lavender print but no overwhelming chemical smell. Guests visiting my office mentioned how clean everything felt—a compliment I can partly attribute to switching to these bags. However, although ""eco-friendly"" is advertised, I wished there was more transparency about the materials used or certifications backing up this claim.  

**Versatility in Everyday Use**  
These colorful trash bags proved their versatility throughout my home. I used them in bedrooms for disposing of random packaging, in the kitchen for small cleaning tasks, and especially during pet waste clean-ups. Even during a family road trip, these fit snugly into the car waste organizer, saving us from travel chaos caused by snack wrappers and coffee cups. For such a minor product, it unexpectedly found so many useful roles in my daily routine. I even joked about officially dubbing them ""emergency backup bags"" because of how reliable they were wherever needed.

**Merits**  
- Tear-resistant and durable, even when holding pointy or wet waste  
- Tight-sealing drawstrings prevent leaks and make for hygienic use  
- Suitable for various uses around the home, office, or car  
- Eco-friendly design is a great nod to environmental awareness  

**Pitfalls**  
- Limited size may not suffice for larger households or heavy-duty tasks  
- Lack of clear certifications or specifics on the eco-friendliness claim  
- While unscented, some users may wish for more scent options  

**Product Alternatives**  
When comparing this trash bag to competitor options, a few notable rivals include strong performers like Hefty’s smaller bag range and Glad's 4-gallon options. With Hefty, you know you’re getting a brand famously known for durability, though they lack the range of colors and eco-conscious appeal of the VOK TBMSXYC01. Meanwhile, Glad bags often feature added scent technology that some people swear by, especially for bathroom use. In my experience, though, I appreciated the refined simplicity of these bags—sometimes less is more. Frankly, the VOK bags feel more thoughtfully designed for compact spaces, though Hefty and Glad bags might edge them out slightly on upscale finishes or size flexibility.

**Price Performance**  
Taking value into account, these trash bags offer a surprisingly good price-to-quality ratio. They’re affordable without feeling ""cheap,"" which is something I always value in household products meant for everyday use. Compared to competitors, they strike a balance of being accessible while delivering robust functionality. Would I recommend these over pricier alternatives? Certainly, for users needing something reliable for small spaces, like dorms or bathrooms. Splurging unnecessarily on fancier bags doesn’t seem justified when VOK delivers.

Review,"The Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W Reverse Osmosis System is a sleek choice for anyone exploring premium water filtration systems. I’ve been using this innovative under-sink RO system daily, and I’ll admit, it’s made a strong impression. Between its tankless design and advanced filtration technology, it offers cutting-edge benefits, but let’s delve into all the details—the good and the not-so-good.

**Design That Saves Space and Cuts the Clutter**

The tankless design quickly caught my attention. Most reverse osmosis systems I’ve encountered come with a bulky tank that awkwardly rules under-sink space like an unwelcome landlord. In contrast, this system is a minimalist’s delight. It fits neatly beneath my kitchen sink, leaving ample room for cleaning supplies and other essentials. It’s surprisingly compact for all that it delivers—measuring just 17.33 x 5.91 x 13.98 inches. And while 25 pounds sounds hefty on paper, installation wasn’t cumbersome at all. 

**Pros**
- Compact and space-saving, tankless design
- Neatly hides under the sink without being intrusive
- Aesthetically appealing for modern kitchens

**Exceptional Filtration Performance**

Seven-stage filtration is no joke! Over the last month of use, I’ve been stunned by how pure the water tastes—tea and coffee feel elevated, and even plain water somehow feels indulgent. The system reduces total dissolved solids (TDS) effectively, ensuring contaminants like lead don’t stand a chance. Impressively, it’s FCC certified for lead-free materials, which added peace of mind, especially for my family’s health. With the ability to produce up to 600 gallons of filtered water daily, it exceeded my household’s needs seamlessly, and refilling large pots or washing greens was faster than expected. The 200ml cup-filling speed in under 8 seconds? Not just a flex—it’s a practical advantage.

**Convenient Setup and Filter Maintenance**

DIY install claims are often promises that scream ‘major headache in disguise,’ but that’s not the case here. The setup was straightforward, and the icing on the cake was the twist-and-pull design for the filters, allowing me to replace them in a matter of seconds. No tools, no hassle. Plus, the built-in indicators mean no more guessing when it’s time for a swap. Even if you’re not particularly handy (I’m not!), you can have this up and running within 30 minutes.

**Eco-Conscious Water Usage**

I value products that aim to minimize waste, and this purifier achieves just that with its remarkable 2:1 pure-to-drain ratio, producing only one cup of wastewater for every two cups of filtered water. Traditional systems can’t compete here, as they’re notorious for wasting more than they save. I’ve even found myself reusing the wastewater for chores like mopping, which makes this a standout feature for anyone trying to live more sustainably.

**Boons**
- Produces 600 gallons of filtered water per day
- Energy-efficient and caters to large families or small offices
- Simple maintenance with easy filter-replacement features
- Eco-friendly water-saving tech with a 2:1 pure-to-drain ratio

**Less Perfect Aspects**

While I genuinely enjoy this product, there are a few details that could benefit from some tweaking. It uses proprietary filters, which means substitutions aren’t an option—so you’re locked into their replacements. The filters are high quality but still worth considering if you’re all about flexibility. Moreover, the system is a bit on the heavier side, so the initial install might feel intimidating for some users. Another thing that might deter people: it operates with an electric pump, meaning it’s reliant on power. That could be a mild inconvenience in areas prone to outages.

**Drawbacks**
- Proprietary filters may limit options for budget-conscious users  
- Requires electricity to function, so it’s unusable during power cuts
- Slightly heavy build adds challenges during the initial installation  

**Alternatives to Consider**

How does the Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W measure against competitors? I’ve tested several brands over the years, including traditional tank-based systems like APEC and energy-efficient contenders such as iSpring. While the tanked systems suffer from size and waste inefficiencies, the iSpring has a slight edge in customizable features that Waterdrop lacks. However, none offer Waterdrop’s fast flow rate and efficient waste ratio. APEC, though functional, feels outdated compared to the sleek and modern approach here. 

Compared to pricier brands like AquaTru, the Waterdrop performs well without asking for an arm and leg. AquaTru edges out on premium aesthetics but at a significantly higher cost, while this system maintains quality and value without overinflating the price point.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

No one wants to overspend on a home appliance if they can avoid it, but this RO system strikes a solid balance between affordability and robust functionality. You’re paying for more than just a filtration system; it’s a performance-boosted, maintenance-friendly, and waste-reducing investment. It feels like a long-term solution rather than a stopgap. That said, individuals on tight budgets might weigh similar alternatives before committing, especially given the non-negotiable replacement filters. But for me? It’s a purchase I don’t regret.

We were messaging back and forth for a while, it was going well and had a lot in common. We'd both listed that we're looking for a life partner. He asked to take me out for coffee and we started planning logistics. We agreed on today as he's in London for a week from tomorrow. 

We discussed what day's best, location, etc., then I sought to clarify the time and he disappeared for a whole day. Yesterday he replied to give a vague time and venue, so I replied with specifics. Six hours later at 9pm (the night before the date), he replied to say, ""I'm not great checking this app, what's your number?"" and still hadn't clarified the venue. I found it suspect that after messaging me back and forth as soon as we met, suddenly he's not great at checking the app. That's a quick personality change.

The date is in less than four hours and he has still not messaged me. I still don't know what cafe we're meeting at. 

I'm finding this inconsiderate and disrespectful. I'm feeling really annoyed about this. The least he could've done is clarify the logistics by now. If he does message, I'm considering telling him that this behaviour doesn't align with my values and cancelling the date. As someone who's looking for something longterm, this is a yellow flag.

I've been obsessing over kitchen gadgets lately, and I recently discovered some amazing features in modern electric kettles that totally blew my mind. I thought I'd share what I found since it might help others who are looking to upgrade their morning routine.

I spent weeks researching and testing different models, and wow, the technology has come so far from the basic kettles we grew up with. The newest electric kettles now come with temperature control settings, which is perfect for tea enthusiasts like me who know that green tea burns at boiling temperatures.

One feature that really impressed me is the keep-warm function. You can keep your water at your desired temperature for up to an hour! This is super convenient when you're working from home and want multiple cups of tea throughout the day. I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

The gooseneck spouts are another game-changer. If you're into pour-over coffee, you'll appreciate the precise control over water flow. Plus, many new models have built-in filters to remove impurities and prevent limescale buildup.

Safety features have also improved dramatically. The auto-shutoff function is standard now, but newer models also include boil-dry protection and cool-touch exteriors. Some even have LED displays that change color when the water reaches different temperatures!

What really caught my attention was the variable temperature presets. Most premium electric kettles now come with buttons for different beverages - one for coffee (200°F), another for green tea (175°F), and so on. It takes the guesswork out of preparation.

I've noticed that cordless designs are becoming more popular too. The kettle sits on a powered base, making it easier to pour and store. Some even have transparent windows with water level indicators that light up!

If you're interested in checking out these features, I found some great deals here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. The prices are actually pretty reasonable considering the technology you're getting.

One thing I've learned is that these modern electric kettles aren't just about boiling water anymore - they're about precision, convenience, and actually improving the taste of your beverages. The difference in taste when using the right temperature is noticeable, especially with delicate teas.

Quick-boil technology is another feature worth mentioning. The newest models can boil water in just a few minutes, which is perfect for busy mornings. Some even have scheduling features, so your water is ready when you wake up!

After using these new electric kettles, I can't imagine going back to my old one. The combination of precision temperature control, safety features, and convenience has really upgraded my daily routine. Let me know if you have any questions about specific features - I'd be happy to share more details from my research!",1,1758446724.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nmngou,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1nmngou/day_7_of_delmosart_and_its_been_a_wild_ride_so/,Day 7 of Delmosart and it's been a wild ride so far... Here are my experiences.,"Hi all, I'm 41F and I've been prescribed Delmosart 18mg for 1 week, to move up to 36mg tomorrow. 

My first week has been... Interesting. I thought I'd share it here and pick the brains of anyone with similar side effects and tips or tricks to share for the rest of the journey.

I've been taking my medication at 8am with 500ml water shortly followed by a decaf coffee and a breakfast of either eggs and toast or protein granola and milk. Day 6 and 7 was a weekend and I took my meds at 9.30am.

**Day 1**

I felt focused. Organised. No real sense of feeling the medication kick in, but I tidied my house, focused in a Zoom call, and did a lot of work that had been hanging over my head. Maybe it was psychosomatic; I don't know. But other than that, no real effects. I went to bed at midnight.

**Day 2**

I woke up at 6am, before my alarm, which is unusual for me. I felt a physical ""come up"" on day 2. It felt like I'd suddenly got a bit drunk, but only for about thirty seconds, after which I righted myself. 

I noticed myself not snacking. Tidying up after cooking and sorting menial tasks wasn't a challenge. I just got stuff done. 

I picked my son up from school and when walking home had a very strange moment where my entire brain felt quiet. My brain normally feels like about 12 voices all shouting over each other but it just... Stopped? It was very serene and very weird. I loved it.

I got very tired about 10pm, and went to bed at 11.

**Day 3** 

I had very, very vivid dreams overnight, but compared to the nightmares I've had on amitriptyline, they were pretty pleasant so I wasn't distressed. 

I had a really productive therapy session. It felt easier to talk about tough things. I didn't snack at all but had a really nutritious lunch because it felt like my body was craving it. I still felt focused and when I went shopping I was able to buy only what I needed. Instead of noticing new things and thinking ""sod it, I'll buy it,"" I was making proper choices. 

I did some paperwork and got some tough admin out of the way. By 5pm I had a bit of a headache but I led a Zoom meeting and coped well when my internet dropped out and I was kicked out mid-session - in the past, I'd have panicked.

I got a mild ache in my lower back that was constant but not unbearable.

I went to bed at 10pm because I felt drained. Had sex and felt so incredibly able to focus that I cried afterwards because it was so strange to not be distracted and to be just able to let go and enjoy it.

**Day 4** 

I had more vivid dreams and slept until 7.30am. I began to feel a little more like my old self - less focused and more scatterbrained. I found my short fuse returning. Managed to stay focused, though, because it wasn't as bad and I was able to notice patterns. 

A headache began, quite slight but constant, at the foot of my skull. 

I still wasn't snacking and was now finding myself not able to finish big meals.

I got a very strong ache in the backs of my legs that was uncomfortable. I drank an Iron Bru and weirdly, it went away, but did come back at bedtime. It wasn't unbearable, but it wasn't pleasant.

I went to bed at 10.30pm, exhausted.

**Day 5**

I filled out all my forms - blood pressure slightly raised but it usually is when I take it myself. 

I had more vivid dreams. Slept until 8.30am. 

The headache worsened and was there all day, developing around 5pm into general malaise and myalgia. I had a very stressful event happen that I had to deal with and I didn't drink enough water, I think. I got incredible dry mouth, and felt sick. I couldn't finish dinner, and tried to eat ice-cream but it made me feel nauseous. 

I got lots of boring admin done before the stressful event; this is stuff I'd have hated prior to medication and I found it almost soothing this time around. However, the stress of the unexpected event meant I had palpitations and felt incredibly anxious, though I felt I navigated it much better than I would have done previous.

My headache didn't stop, and I went to bed at 10pm, falling asleep almost immediately.

**Day 6**

More vivid dreams, woke up at 8am. 

Headache much better, though still there. Getting out of the house helped a lot; I went to the supermarket. I wasn't as focused as previous but still able to control what I purchased.

I was able to stay on top of housework though it felt much more like my executive dysfunction was kicking in again. I felt sad that my meds weren't working - irrational thinking, a key part of past me. I forced myself to power through. 

Appetite still only present at meal times. Still turning down snacks. I drank a lot more water today as I feared that was what had caused my previous headache and it seemed to work. 2 litres plus 2 cups of decaf coffee and I felt much better.

I had a very relaxed day after sorting out the stressful event from the day before. I felt much more able to ""let go"" of things that previously I'd have held onto and overanalysed. 

I felt able to initiate sex, which I haven't ever really felt able to do because I always got distracted. That felt nice to be able to do. Weirdly, I found it much easier to orgasm.

Went to sleep at midnight.

**Day 7**

Woke up at 7.45am. More vivid dreams, and I've woken up emotional. My partner had a lie in and I came down for my meds. I got a horrible feeling he was going to end our relationship and I had to seek comfort from him, in tears. It was sudden, unreasonable, and unfounded. I don't even know where it came from. He reassured me and all is well.

I feel brighter after a talk and feel a need to go for a walk, or to do something physical after a lazy day yesterday. I'm a little nervous about increasing my dose tomorrow.

**Overall findings so far**

Overall, it's been a strange week, but nowhere near as hard as I'd expected. The headache day was a hard one, but in general I'm feeling much more stable and able to be kind to myself. 

My appetite being more focused towards mealtimes is great for me, because I was edging into being overweight and I struggled to diet in the past due to snacking (I felt constantly hungry). I think I finally realise what ""food noise"" is, though it's just another one of the loud voices that exist in my mind.

My head does feel, in general, a lot calmer. The noise isn't necessarily gone (bar the one experience on the school run) but it feels as if I am more able to ""file"" the things I need to do into some kind of running order rather than sitting paralysed. I hadn't expected that, but it's quite nice to be able to structure my thoughts better.

Intimacy with my partner feels so much more intuitive and natural and I love it. I can't believe how much inner monologue I was fighting previously.

Anyway, I hope this acts as another informative experience of life in week 1 of titration. If so, I will keep notes for next week of my experiences on 36mg. 

My main questions are:

- Did the Irn Bru help my aches or is that in my head?
- Is there anything else I can do to avoid headaches?
- Is there anything to keep in mind when I'm increasing my dose?

Thank you all, if you've got this far!",3,1758446647.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

1nmnerl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1nmnerl/should_i_take_a_break_or_not/,Should i take a break or not?,"

The answer to this question is as simple as it gets. Take a break when you need one. You’ll come across signs from your body and brain, recognize these signs and act on them before it is too late. 
Every single activity that you perform in your daily lives counts. 
The time you wake up at, if or not you have your breakfast, if or not you meditate, if or not you pray to the ultimate boss up above, if or not you eat healthy and drink enough water, if or not you are surrounded by people who care about you and vice versa, if or not you spend time with your loved ones, your screen time, if or not you sleep on time, if or not you read before bed and the list goes on.. 

Believe me when I say this, all the above mentioned and many other factors deteriorate your mental health in the ways you can’t imagine! 
Take a break every time you feel. Study in breaks, work hard but don’t lose your mental peace because in the end YOU is all that matter.

Also:

1. Is phone ko aag laga do yehi sari problems ki jadd hai (you know it’s true). 

2. Drink lots of water. According to BRITA INDIA, a healthy adult needs around 35 ml of water each day per kilogram of body weight. 

3. “Main mental health break par hun” bolne me koi sharam nahi hai. 

4. Procrastination is a mechanism that your body uses to save itself from the humility of failure. To get out of it, just start doing whatever it is that you are afraid of. Our brain is accustomed to following habits. Change your habits to stop procrastinating- AND YES IT TAKES EFFORT! 

5. “Caffeine is sansaar ki dushman hai, aaao ise mil kar khtm karein” bol bol kar jo log coffee par coffee gatkate hain (chai drinkers included here), excess caffeine intake disturbs your circadian rhythm which leads to potential risks of insomnia. Insomnia is when your body is unable to sleep, it’s not insomnia when you scroll reels till 3 am DELIBERATELY.

I've been deep in thought recently abot this strange wave of joy that sudenly washed over me the other day. It came outta nowhere wile I was just stiting at a cafe, sipping on some coffee, and peopple-watching. There wasn't anything particularly special going on, just the usaul hustle and bustle. But for some reason, this intense feeling of happiness hit me, and honestly, I don't even know why.

It got me wondering if these moments of ranodm joy serve as little reminders from the unievrse to slow down and appreciate the simple stuff. Could be about living in the present or maybe it's something else entirely. I guess I'm just puzzled about how emotions can be so random and unpredictable, yet somehow they make everything feel more connected.

Do you ever have those moments that feel just... right? Like the world is whispering secrets to you that only you can hear? It's a wierd feeling but quite comforting. Ayway, thanks for listening. Hope the universe sends you a little joyful surprise soon, too.

It's seeping from the jar as if it's alive, even though lid is on fairly tight. I'm scraping a little every morning from the outside of the jar, since I don't want to waste it - that's the reason I didn't simply wash it off.

I was on a strict lactose-free and gluten-free diet along with medicines for a couple of months and again, I started healing.

1nmmr5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1nmmr5t/the_teeth_of_the_sea/,The Teeth Of The Sea,"The pink sands sparkled softly under the dim moonlight passing through the thin clouds. 

The ocean waves ebbed and flowed, occasionally crashing upon the sands angrily, and at other times, gently brushing their way up the shoreline. These irregular movements of the sea matched the strange, red, Van Gogh-esque sky above, the softer shades flowing like flowers in the wind, and the darker shades dancing wildly like a forest fire.

A young man sat silently in the midst of it all. His long black hair blowing with the ocean breeze. His ragged brown clothes turned almost black, soaked with the salty waters that continuously washed up beneath him as he sat. His feet wriggling in the cold sands,  partially buried. In his lap, a thin stack of paper.. His thin hands scribble away, writing something illegible under the moonlight on the few loose pieces of paper, and in a language not of this world.   
  
I watched him do that, four times, from the far bank, hiding in the tall red grass. I stood, an unmoving statue. I knew the man: he was the last friend I had. Every month, when the sky began to twist and twirl, and the winds picked up, and the moon held high in the sky, peaking through the thin clouds, one of my friends would disappear.   
  
I’m not sure if they were ever good friends, even friends at all. I think maybe I would be more panicked, distraught at the regular disappearances, and dwindling size of my tiny little clique. But I never felt like I fit in with them, was rather a spectator of everything bad and good, a spectator of every memory, a blip for them. Just as I am now, a simple silhouette in the darkness, watching their lives unfold, reaching their climax, while mine remains dull and empty.   
  
In the end, we were really only friends by happenstance. In the Stacks, under the shadow of the Kings, everyone is stuffed in tightly. Most housing is shared, four or five people to a room. Homelessness is rampant, squatters in every possible house and store, abandoned or not. We, being the fortunate few, were able to go to school, and the five of us were put into one small sharehouse for the years we would be attending.   
  
It was in our final stretch, the last five months of our school, that they started to go missing. Not that anyone cared, people always go missing in the Stacks. The only ones who cared were us, but as I stated before, I myself cared less than the others, I was just a watcher. Each month after one disappeared, a paper would show up on the dining table.   
  
I know that paper is what he is writing as he sits out there by the waters, because everyone else wrote it too. The exact same pages from the exact same notebook, a strange thing one of them brought home one day as a fun coffee table item. Made of strange fishy skins and scales, the bindings adorned with sharp teeth. Pages would go missing. Five always, the exact same tear each time. Each torn edge aligning perfectly, resembling small, rolling dunes, similar to the ones found on this beach.   
  
We’d receive said torn pages on said table, appearing out of thin air, maybe a week after they would go missing. Each one was full of scribbles and space jargon that I couldn’t understand, yet the remaining other friends would gather and read each one, like it was just the daily newspaper. Then the next one would go missing. Another set of pages would be torn out, then reappear a week or two later, the writing almost identical to the previous, yet slightly messier. But not in the way that someone's handwriting may be better than another’s, but intentionally, purposefully messy. The scribbles aligned perfectly with the last set, but roughed up around the edges, again and again.  
  
Until it was just me, and the one last of my friends left, the one I am watching sit on the beach right now, doing the exact same things the others must have done too. 

It was the fourth month into our final stretch of schooling. We sat down together for the first time in a while, a hot pot of tea brewing on the stove. A slow whistle of steam exiting the kettle, the water gurgling as it boiled inside. Staring down at the dirty tabletop, we didn’t say a word. 

The pitch of the steam peaked, screaming loudly at us. The tea was done brewing.  
  
“Tea’s ready…” I said.   
  
“Yeah. Sounds like it.” He rubbed the surface of the table in odd cursive-esque strokes, then would stiffly and almost angrily push in stout geometric shapes. He was writing something in the dust; I couldn’t make it out.    
  
“Do you want some?” I couldn’t push any sort of tone out of my throat. As always, I was melancholic. More so than usual, the last friend I had left was clearly about to head to his demise. 

He had this odd, oceanic smell to him. The scent of his body was briny, earthy, and refreshing. Normally, our dorm smelled like wet dog, the scent of the rot within the Stacks making its way through the cracking concrete walls. But he acted like incense, cleaning the room of its foul smell, cleansing the air around him.

I never got a response from him. I just poured him one anyway, alongside my own. He didn’t like black tea so I added some milk. I knew he hated it so much, it almost made him puke, so I don’t think milk would do much for him. 

In my attempts to care, I still felt nothing. I always called them my friends, but they never treated me as such, and in my vain attempts, I don’t know if I really treated them like one either. I handed him the mug.  
  
He just placed it down and stood up from the table and that moment was over. It would be the last time I saw him, until now, as I watch him on the red beach, the sky twisting above. In the distance I can see a storm forming. The waves started to gain a rhythm, their inconsistent ebb and flow turning into a soft, motherly caress on the shore, tickling his sandy, buried toes.   
  
As I watched the weather change, and as I watched him work, I wondered how those pieces of paper ever returned to us, undamaged and dry. Because, as he finished each one, he would place them gently on the sand in front of him, and the tide would reach out with its long fingers, and pull the paper out to sea.   
  
With each scribbling finished, the storm would approach closer, its thunder furiously escalating with each strike upon the dark waters. The tide's gentle fingers quickly turned to heavy palms smacking down onto the letters and pulling them into the abyss each time with rapid acceleration. I was getting seasick just watching, I could feel my head get dizzy, my eyelids heavy, and my throat tighten. The different hues of red became almost all the angry, swirling dark, velvety maroon.

As the fourth piece of paper was placed down, a colossal wave manifested before the both of us in the blink of an eye. There was no build up to it. The thunder crashed rapidly, sending sparks of light through the red sands and dark waters, revealing something moving rigidly beneath the surface. The body is almost definitely larger than the Kings, whose heads pierce the sky above. It was clear, though, that it wasn’t the full body, only what would be comparable to a finger on our own body. 

The fifth paper was never written.

Instead, his time was nigh. Placing the blank page down atop the fourth, he raised his hands to the sky as the wave crashed down onto him. In the massive wave, I could make out a tiny section of a top jaw.  Sharp, yellowing teeth infinitely descending into the back of the mouth. Some teeth bigger than me, but some smaller than a fingernail. This, though, was all that I witnessed from afar at that time. I wonder what he was seeing up close. He looked to be at peace, could he even be witnessing the same horror I am? 

The wave crashed down and the world grew quiet. My sea sickness faded as everything returned to normal. The sky’s various hues returned, the tides relaxed to their normal pattern, the thunder came to an immediate halt. And now it was just me. Staring at the empty space on the beach where he had been sitting. Just me, the soft ocean breeze. 

I was witness to it all, witness to life unfolding as I always had been. I didn’t know how to react; my breath hastening, my face growing numb, I started moving forward towards the shore but I couldn’t feel my legs moving. My arms began swinging wildly as I stumbled down to the shore line, the wind rushing past my ears. 

I called out, I tried to call out, but nothing came.

I realized I couldn’t remember his name. I couldn’t remember any of my “friends” names.

I reached the shoreline and the water softly grazed the toes of my shoes. I was hoping it too would grow in rage and drag me out with them. But nothing changed, the wind stayed soft and the tide remained gentle. Even the inconsistent ebb and flow ended, and now it was just calm. It was as if it didn’t want to take me. 

I really was just a witness. I was never a friend for them, and they were never a friend for me. Yet I still continued to run to where he was, a helpless act that I felt compelled to do. Maybe I wished I had been their friend; I think I wanted to go with them. It looked so peaceful, in all the terror of the weather, of the angry waves, of the reddening sky and darkening sea, it looked so much better than whatever I would have to go back to. Go back to being alone. 

I tried to scream out to him one more time, I don’t know why. Maybe I was hoping I could get his name out. I didn’t care he was gone, I cared more that I never actually knew who he was.

“Hey!” I called out. It was all I could muster in my empty breaths. A simple hey. 

I collapsed to my knees. Something poked me.

Beneath my knee was the pen he had been using to scribble his gibberish. I picked it up, shaking the sand off of it, picking the few grains that had gotten into the barrel. My mind was empty. I wanted to go to them, I wanted to go to the sea, meet them again, and maybe, I could grow close to them. 

No, that wasn’t true.

I never cared before, and more so I was just jealous that something had happened to them, and not to me. I wanted to behold the terror they just witnessed. I wanted to experience the bliss of their final moments. I didn’t want to return to the sin-ridden city of the Stacks. The reek of sewage always enters my nose. 

I took a deep breath. Enjoying the ocean breeze one last time before I took the long walk back home. Then, a soft tide approached me, a strange, stained piece of paper pushing up at the tip of the tide's fingers. The tear on the side matches perfectly with the sandy dunes of the beach. It was blank. It was the fifth piece of paper, somehow completely dry, not a grain of sand on it.

I clicked the pen, the tip pushing out the grains I couldn’t reach. And I began to write, I began to beg. My scribbles didn’t match theirs as hard as I tried. I tried to mimic their strange right angles and the elegant cursive loops. Eventually, it just turned to English, words of wishes for something to happen to me, to be a part of whatever the hell all this was. My tears dripping onto the piece of paper, blotching the not-yet dry ink. 

The weather never changed, the tides didn’t enrage, and the sky didn’t darken. I was given a chance to be something, have something happen to me, and I failed. 

I looked down at the wet sand, the tide tickling the toes of my shoes softly, and I placed the paper and pen down in front of me. I just knelt there, and cried, the paper wettened, a mixture of my salty tears and the salty sea. The paper is half black, the ink spreading across the page. 

I looked up, out to the sea, but through my blurred vision, all I saw was a black wall standing in front of me. Slithering around in the wall, infinite rows of teeth, varying sizes, some as large as my torso, some two times taller than me, some as big as my pinky toe. 

Somehow, my cries were answered, but witness to the massive wave, I no longer wanted to join them. As the wave approached, I saw the full picture.

Thousands of tongues wriggled, licking the slithering teeth sensually. There was no bottom to the shallows. The writhing mass of black I saw from the banks was more visible, it was all parts of a mouth. Rigid teeth, wet tongues, gums and cheek, all mashed haphazardly into a massive ouroboros that occupied almost the entire shore, and deep into the far depths beyond.

It wasn't a blissful sight, it was exactly the horror I witnessed from the banks. I could feel it breathing on me. The ocean breeze, that once smelled so good, so refreshing, was now just a hot and hungry breath.

 I stood and tried to turn but the wave crashed down on me. Immediately I could feel my clothes and skin being shredded like cheese on a grater. One of the largest teeth dug into my shoulder and in a millisecond my arm was severed. The gums and tongues rubbing against my bare, tearing skin. Tasting me.

I screamed and screamed into the black waters, wasting all my air. Entering my open mouth, a small snake of teeth slipped into my throat, slicing my uvula in half and dragging itself down the back of my throat. 

Another large tooth cut both my legs from my body at once. I should have blacked out the moment my arm was ripped from my body, I should have drowned by now, but somehow the suffering lasted for hours. And it wouldn’t ever end, until I was just chunks of conscious flesh. Constantly being gnawed on by the teeth of the sea, and for once, I wish I had stayed just a witness. Just A Nobody. ",1,1758443992.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

1nmmi9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1nmmi9t/about_to_start_6th_and_probably_last_stim_what/,About to start 6th (and probably last stim) - what would you do to maximize chances? 43F,"I am 43, and have 2 euploids from 5 rounds that I started just before turning 43. Before transfer, I need to have a fibrome removed, and before that need to take hormones to try and suppress the fibrome first. All of this (hormones + surgery + recovery before transfer) adds another 6-9 months before a transfer can take place, and the Dr. has suggested we should think of this as 9 months rather than 6.

This means by the time we do the transfer, I will be too old to do any further egg retrievals. So, with my partner (35M), we decided to do one last ER before the hormone treatment starts.

All of a sudden, I am feeling a lot of stress around this last ER, like it is our ""last chance"". The previous ERs, appart from secondary effects of the hormones, I felt more relaxed around the stats / outcomes.

What would you do to make this last ER a positive experience, and to maximize your chances?

So in total we will be doing 6 rounds of IVF. The first three were back-to-back, then two months off for work travel + holiday. And now we have done 2 rounds back-to-back, and are about to start (next week) the last round, the previous ER was on 12 September.

ERs always led to high number of fertilized eggs (from 10-16 fertilized eggs each time), but only 2-4 blastocysts each time. Whenever we had a ""higher"" number of blastocysts (3 or 4), which also corresponded to a higher blast rate, we had a euploid, and whenever we had 2 blastocysts, which also corresponded to a lower blast rate, we had only aneuploids. We are still waiting for the results from ER5, but only had 2 blastocysts from 12 fertilized eggs, so I am already assuming they will both be aneuploid.

I eat mostly healthily (cook from scratch, eat lots of vegetables, but do have a sweet tooth for dessert/chocolate and am a little bit overweight, BMI 27.5), don't smoke, rarely drink (1-2 glasses per month), have 2-3 light (filter) coffees per day, and my only exercise is light walking, with occasional small hike or swim in a lake. The only supplement I take is folic acid. I have a high stress job, mostly because of long hours, but otherwise mostly a desk job. I have already cancelled two long-distance work trips in September and October, specifically for this round of ER and the previous one.

The idea would be to do this egg retrieval mid-October. Start the hormone treatment in November, travel for holiday November. Then starts my busiest work period December-January, which includes travel in January. Then have surgery earlier February. Recovery until July, with another long-distance work travel in May, and then transfer either July or August 2026.",1,1758443051.0,IVF,0,1.0,False

1nmmgop,https://www.reddit.com/r/maykwentoako/comments/1nmmgop/corruption_kahit_saan/,Corruption Kahit Saan,"While watching livestreams on the current rallies around the country over coffee dito sa bahay, di ko na alam kung anong nangingibabaw na emotion meron ako ngayon. Galit, lungkot, hiya, pagkawalang pag-asa, naalala ko bigla yung one time na nakausap ko isang small-enterprise na supplier namin sa work, this was way before Pandemic.  Been working in procurement for more than 10 years na that time.  This supplier was just just newly accredited sa company. We only award POs to accredited suppliers. Big or Small suppliers undergo accreditation and all are fairly given  equal opportunities to participate bidding events.  Now this new supplier won my bidding on Frames. They offered the lowest price among the compliant bidders. So they were awarded the PO and eventually, they delivered the ordered items just right on time.  Payments are issued within 30 days (usually earlier) in the form of manager’s checks and are released via the company’s partner commercial bank.  I assumed this supplier was able to seamlessly claimed their check after they received the system notification.  

And then this supplier representative, I remember she seemed to be the owner, went to see me in our office.  She was looking so happy and grateful. She was saying thank you for the opportunity and she was hoping to have more POs from us. I just told her na to be just very active in our online bidding events and be fairly competitive.  I showed her list of bidding events that she can join while they are open. Then, out of the blue, she carefully slid an envelope towards my left hand. With all honesty, I thought it was a letter or some form of brochure as it was common that suppliers leave us product brochures. Then lo and behold when I opened it, there was cash inside. If di ako nagkakamali, it was around 3K or 5K. Di ko na binilang but they were new 500 bills. I stared at the supplier and quite frankly was at loss for words for a few seconds. Then in our dialect I asked her para saan to? My other fellow purchasers were a few meters away from me so they may have no idea what’s happening as they were also busy with our daily transactions.  The supplier just said na it was just a thank you for the awarding them the PO. 

And being the calm one always l, if not all the time, i just closed the envelope, put it down in front of her and looked her in the eye and said, “Maam, I’m sorry but this is not how we do our business here.  For this, I will not report you but I will ban you from joining my future bidding.”  She was horrified and was apologizing almost nonstop. She told me na it’s their first time daw that she experienced na tinanggihan yung pera or token nila. Excluding us, their customers are government agencies and a few private companies. Every transaction daw, since they started their business (wood works, fabrication, trader) hinihingan sila or SOP na daw na nagbibigay sila. If hindi daw sila magbigay, di na daw sila makakaulit mabigyan ng project or PO. Ang tagal din daw bago sila mabayaran like 3-6 months. She expected the same from our company.  I told her na ibahin nyo ang company namin.  Naawa ako sa kanya kasi nakita kong parang genuine yung shock nya realizing na may business din pala talaga na walag lagay2x or under the table. And she was apologizing and promised never to do that again.  Told her na yung pera, i-pang bonus na nya sa mga staff nya. And she said pag uwi nya, mag meeting daw sila ng staff nya and end na nila makipag transact to any govt agencies kasi may hope naman pala sa private sector.  Natawa lang ako kasi nag attempt din sya magbigay nalang nga chocolates para nalang daw dun sa pag help ko na ma correct ang wrongdoing nila. Forever daw na mag thank you sila sa company namin kasi parang we saved them  na masira sila in the long run. I respectfully turned down parin the chocolates and reminded her that any form of gifts, monetary and material is a NO-NO talaga. She eventually understood the message.  She left the office na parang nahiya pa rin but this time parang may bitbit na good news. 
 
True enough, I temporarily banned this supplier from joining the biddings for 6 months. When I invited them again, they became very active and became very known to other sister companies as well coz of their workmanship and good reputation. Until now pag nagkikita kami ni Maam when she has a project sa company she will always mention how our office saved their company.  Never again that they joined any government projects. Naaawa nalang daw sya sa mga kasabayan nya na contractors / suppliers na up to now naka tie-up sa gobyerno. Yung iba daw lumaki ng bigla yung company while yung iba na bankrupt. Very contented na daw sila sa pa konti-konting profit basta steady dahil sa reputation nila.  

Nag usap kami recently ng mga fellow purchasers na pano nagagawa ng government staff sa dpwh, procurement and other agencies to be confidently  pocketing money from projects na kung based lang sa system meron kami as a private sector, hindi basta2x kami nakaka award or issue ng PO to a certain entity.  Whether its a simple item such as a bond paper to very complicated ones such as machineries, equipments or a special chemical, lahat dadaan sa default processes and andaming approving authorities. Each justification is being scrutinized and reviewed before approving. Not to mention the various internal and external audits within the year.  Eversince din, we take out “NO GIFTS POLICY” seriously. Whenever we go to ocular visits to suppliers, we always…always, turn down any offers of snacks foods, coffee, even water, freebies.  I know it sounds OA. Unless we ask for a water if uhaw na talaga.  So if i-implement talaga ng government seriously all programs that will eliminate any possible window for corruption, especially internally, within the staff, the officers, from the lowest ranking employee to the sitting chief, walang mangyayaring corruption.  

More than going to the streets and chanting for change, when we get back to our homes and offices, let’s all give our selves the necessary reset.  In our own little way, let’s end corruption.  ",1,1758442882.0,maykwentoako,0,1.0,False
1nmmerv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmmerv/feeling_like_a_burden/,feeling like a burden,"(background that is relevant to current story): i have been estranged from my parents for over 6 months. this situation and others has been challenging for my mental health and for the last 2 years, ive been severely struggling with anxiety and depression . 

this weekend my husband, toddler and i (34f) traveled out of state to visit my sister (30f). this trip is the only thing i have looked forward to in months. 

overall the weekend has been wonderful. i have repeatedly thanked my sister for hosting us. my husband and i have paid for every meal and morning coffee run since we arrived. today we spent the afternoon at a festival and my toddler was not feeling it. he carried on an tantrumed which put me into a state on anxious panic trying to figure out how to settle him. once my son finally ate and got out of the sun, he was in a better mood and i pulled myself out of my anxious spiral. on the drive home i told my sister how much i’ve been struggling mentally, especially when my toddler acts out. i know in my right mind it’s not my fault and he’s just a typical toddler, but (hopefully otber moms will understand) there is just this internal panic when your baby won’t stop crying and nothing you’re trying is working….

fast forward a few hours, my son takes a nap, my husband mows my sisters lawn… the day has turned around. then once my son wakes up he has a snack and immediately wants to go outside. he carries on in the house for a little while and then i say to my sister “hey he’s upset i think we’ll take him to the playground”. my sister responds “i guess… but don’t use all of my gas”. 

this unnecessary comment IMMEDIATELY triggered me. it made me feel like such a burden. this type of comment is a perfect example of the type of things my mom would say to me and it’s a huge factor in why i’ve gone no contact with her. 

i immediately confronted my sister and told her that a unprovoked comment like that makes me feel like we’ve over stayed our welcome, and need to leave. she said “if you leave tonight we will not have a relationship”. she said she doesn’t know why she made the comment, she’s not stressed about gas money, but said we are sisters and sometimes we will make snippy comments and it’s to be expected. 

i am emotionally fragile and can admit that immediately wanting to leave may have been an over reaction. but i also feel like if you watched me have an anxious afternoon, i told you explicitly how much i’m struggling… why even make a comment like that? what was the point?  

i don’t really know what i am looking for with this post. but i truly wanted to get it off my chest…. things are just so damn hard and it truly doesn’t feel like it will ever get better ",1,1758442686.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Felt it like the second. Only shitty exp I’ve had in all my comms over months. Anyways.


In the past, I tried the Alpecin (coffee) one which kinda did some help at the beginning, but nothing proper, the Ketolozin one, which basically increased the hair loss and H&S which I had read was good, but was meh, although I did added rosemary in it (this is truly recommended, have done it since forever and it does do some help), but nothing I know for certain is the “go to” post HT after you finish whatever products they give you.

Do hope doctor will directly recommend something, but was curious if there’s a consensus on what to go to and whether that is over the counter or something that requires prescription.

Really interested only in the people that have had HT about +1-2 years ago to get proper factual data (or as factual as internet can be) and use that reference for my own research. Lots of posts in the different subs but mainly from internet gurús who like to post but will never go for the HT at the end of the day.

1nmmbcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1nmmbcc/im_just_so_tired/,I’m just so tired,"I’m neither introvert nor extrovert. I’m not very extroverted to be able to make friends easily, and not very introverted to be content with myself all the time. I get energised in groups with people. But now, I’m finding my friendships too exhausting. 
I used to have a good social circle in my 20s. But then my husband and I moved to a new city (Vancouver) and in the 5 years we’ve been here, we couldn’t recreate our circle. 
1. Close friends of years like 10 years, who came to our city (before Van) and stayed for 8 months. We got them their place, we would cook for them every week, helped them in their time in a new city. They left for Vancouver after that. A couple of years later, we are here, only saw them once in 4 months… we would tell them lets hang out, let’s go for a coffee, they would come up with an excuse after a week ignoring the message, after a while they completely ghosted us. 
2. Another friend of our first city, she moved to Vancouver too, we were the ones helping her pack the night before her flight, she would cal us literally every day after she moved. We move to Vancouver, we rented a unit in her building by her referral. We kept seeing her for a month,  then we asked her if we can borrow a chair as we hadn’t had the chance to buy anything yet we were literally sleeping, eating and working on a leaking air mattress. She came up with some excuses. We said ok, no problem. But then she started ghosting us. 
3. One friend, she moved to Boston from Vancouver. Then came back a couple months later and she was in a very bad place, emotionally. Won’t get into details but her move didn’t go as she wanted and she was hurt. To help cheer her up, we would go out weekly. Then her roommate (who was in love with her but she wasn’t interested) started acting crazy. Told my husband why he is going out with her to the club, mind you, I was there too. And it wasn’t a club it was a bar with a dance floor. He started getting abusive with her. She found a new place and moved out, we were there for her every step. Helping her out of that situation. Our family were visiting so we got a bit preoccupied with them for 2 months and didn’t get to go out every week. After family left, I msged her to plan a hang out. Turns out she moved to another state. Didn’t tell us. 
4. Work friends have been coming and going, no one would stay, every one would stop responding when they are not coworkers anymore. 
5. Another old friend came to the city, every thing is good. Until his wife, let’s call her Sarah (who was waiting for visa) arrived. I got pregnant at the time, one of our mutual friends lets call her Sunny guessed my pregnancy. And I said yeah I am. I was 8 weeks! 
Next week, we are gathering at Sunny’s house, with Sarah and a bunch of their friends that we don’t know much. Sunny insists on telling everyone in there. Announcing my pregnancy. I hadn’t even told my brother yet. I told her No, but me not being confrontational, didn’t want to drag it. I went to Sarah who didn’t know, and told her before Sunny would announce. I told her because I thought she might get upset if she heard it along with a bunch of strangers. But even so, Sarah stopped talking to me that night after Sunny told everyone. She came around after a few days. And I didn’t say anything about it to either of them. 
A few months later, Sarah and her husband were in the process of buying a house. They made a mistake of running multiple credit checks and when they put an offer down, the bank told them they need another 180K!!! For their down. They asked us for 90K. We didn’t have it, and knew they are buying something they can’t afford and there is no way they could pay us back in less than 10years. We said no. 
Sunny’s family also said no (they ask them for another 70K) a week after, my baby died at 6 months. Sarah did not call, nor visited me. She sent me a text message. While posting on Insta hosting Sunny’s family in their New home. How they got the money I don’t know. I cut her off after a series of messages that I sent her with a literally broken heart. 
6. Now the other friend Sunny still hangs out with them. Last weekend apparently Sarah told her that she cut off contact with mr after my baby died because I didn’t tell her about my pregnancy sooner. I was 8 weeks when she found out!! Which is a lie since she told me she did that because my husband was always very supportive and when they needed the money he backed out. Actually my husband did advise them against buying the house, and it wasn’t like he was part of the process, they told us they put an offer after they found out they are short on Money. 
Now it all got so messy. Sunny’s husband told my husband (they are also coworkers) that Sarah said that was the reason. And my husband got angry and said 1. They are lying. 2. Even if that’s the case, Sunny is responsible for announcing when I didn’t want to.
Now Sunny called me angry asking why he said that and why he put the blame on her. When she called I didn’t know about my husband’s conversation so I didn’t know where that’s coming from. I told her no we don’t blame you for what they did, which was genuine. 

But now I’m just so exhausted of all these drama. It’s draining me. I keep regurgitating all my friendships, what I did wrong, why am I at this point, and I get physically and mentally tired. I went through one of the most horrible things a woman can go through. Losing a baby. Alone and scared. I have only one other friend left for me. The people that I love are not close to me. They are always behind a screen. I don’t know what to do, and how to deal with the loneliness.
I’m scared of finding new friends. It’s getting so hard for me to trust people. I’m creating this wall around me because al the friendships that ended like that left a painful scar and I don’t want to get hurt anymore. Now I don’t try to meet up with people, cause I feel like I always give too much and receive very little in return. So I just stopped trying… ",1,1758442331.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
