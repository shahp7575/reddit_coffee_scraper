Welcome to another episode of Mechanical Mike.

As always, if you enjoy my videos, please like and subscribe. It really helps a lot, and once I hit another milestone I'll do another subscriber meet-up.

Today's episode is going to be a little different than normal, but, before we get to that, I want to pass along some personal news. As you probably know, Mrs Mechanical Mike and I have been having marital troubles, and we've actually decided to split up.

But it's OK. I'm OK.

I'll still see the kids every other weekend, and this way they won't have to see us fighting.

I just wanted to put that out there because I saw some speculation in the comments, and I really hate gossip, OK? I'd rather be honest with you guys.

Anywho, the second piece of personal news is that I lost my job. Yeah, the factory decided to pack up and move their operations to the U.S. Sucks, but what can you do, right?

So if you didn't like and subscribe already, please do so. Every click helps!

With that out of the way, let's get our hands dirty.

In the last few episodes we learned how vacuums work and we deconstructed a coffee machine. What we're doing today is a little different. We'll be taking apart an old fan.

And instead of doing that in my usual spot, my workshop, which I don't have access to since Mrs Mechanical Mike kicked me out, I'll be doing it on my kitchen table.

I hope you guys can see.

Tell me in the comments if you can't and we'll figure it out.

So, as always, the first thing we want to do is look at what the fan looks like all put together. Note what parts we see and where they are. Now, I don't have a diagram for this one, but that's half the fun, really digging around and figuring it out as we go.

I'm going to start by opening the body.

Sometimes there's a clean way to do that, but in this case we're going to have to brute force it a bit.

Basically what I'm going to do is take this saw and start along here, really elbow-greasing it until I get a nice, long groove, and then I'm going to take a crowbar *and really force it in there*‚Äîlike so, and then I'm going to press really freakin‚Äô hard until it comes apart *just like that.*

Boy, that is a real mess. But we'll clean up later. Right now we're going to see what makes this fan tick. Actually, let's play with the wires just a bit, connect them like so, and plug in to power‚Äî

Oh, wow!

It really does give you a new perspective to see it all exposed like that. A real anatomy. Here, let me wipe the camera and show you up close.

That's the heart, the lungs‚Ä¶

1kbq36t,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1kbq36t/passed_cissp_on_my_1st_attempt_in_approx_160/,Passed CISSP on my 1st attempt in approx 160 minutes(150 questions),"I am glad to share that i have passed CISSP provisionally 2 days ago. Honestly exam was brutally difficult much more than my expectation and i had no idea what i was doing, by question number 60 nothing was making sense to me, i realised that i was not able to even connect the dots conceptually at all after studying for good 2 months, call it a stress or whatever. You cant take this exam lightly, questions never come straight, the context and content both are twisted to test your mental ability and concept. When i reached 100th question, i knew i am gonna go further few miles ahead before it ends and tell me "" get the heck of out of this exam centre'. as if Devil was whispering in my year, you might have aced the Bosons, QE but this is different. Welcome to real world.' lol. I kept battling with it and constants negative thoughts and was dragging myself to question number 125 and first time i spoke to God Almighty , i studied hard for this and you will never put me to shame, with that hope i kept going to 140 and was very exhausted, my head was spinning badly by that time. I wanted this to end and somehow managed to finally reach 150. I was sweating coz it was a hot day here in UK, came out of exam centre and lady at the result counter think took my signature and handed me the folded result letter. I was like its okay atleast i gave a good fight and life is all about going through obstacles, i was thinking what am i gonna say to my lovely wife who suffered and sacrificed more than me and then i was 'God you will never fail me as i trusted in you and your word' and opened the letter slowly looking from downwards hoping which domain i did miserably and to my surprise i could not see anything and then somehow for a moment i felt my vision got blurred and looked at the top of the letter and its says ' Congratulations we are pleased to inform you that you have provisionally passed the CISSP'

Honestly i started crying in exam centre(Please don't judge me) and thanked god for his grace on me.

Trust me if i can do it, you all can do it, have faith. That is the key.

Now regarding study materials-

I followed notes from Prabh Nair and his coffee shots. 9/10

Mindmap videos- 8/10

Pete Zerger last mile and 8 hour exam cram - 9/10

Practice tests - Only QE - 9.5/10 did atleast 900 questions and exhausted it.

Nothing can match the QE when it comes to difficulty level, unfortunately my exam was more difficult than QE but it might not be the case with you. Remember every test is different.

My endorser has approved my application and now it says it is under ISC2 Review, my concern is when can i pay the AMF fee of 135 dollars? i mean i can't see any payment reminder on ISC2 dashboard yet, would it be after ISC2 approves my application?

Every time I pick up the JLab JBuds Pro Wireless Earbuds (model JBUDSPROBT-BLK-BOX), their sleek black finish catches my eye. The silicone material feels smooth, durable, and surprisingly lightweight at just 50 grams. Wearing them for extended periods doesn‚Äôt feel cumbersome, even after hours of use. It comes with three sets of gel ear tips and two Cush Fins, allowing a snug fit regardless of ear shape or size. Whether I‚Äôm on a bus or briskly walking through a park, these earbuds stay securely in place. The rounded ear tips are particularly gentle on the ears‚Äîsomething my younger sibling also appreciated when they borrowed them. However, I found the provided micro-USB charging cable a little short, which doesn‚Äôt allow for much flexibility during charging.

**Audio Performance That Impresses**  
Listening to music with these earbuds genuinely feels immersive. Its 10 mm drivers deliver crisp highs, balanced mids, and a bass that thumps without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I‚Äôm streaming upbeat tunes or low-tempo tracks, the sound quality is consistent. The noise isolation feature is excellent at blocking ambient sounds; even at a bustling coffee shop, I enjoyed a clear audio experience. I‚Äôll admit‚Äîthe dynamic sound range surprised me for earbuds in this price bracket. That said, audiophiles might notice that the bass depth, while good, doesn‚Äôt quite reach the level of premium over-ear headphones.

[Ready to snag JLab JBuds Pro Bluetooth Earbuds? Check the Amazon pricing here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b072bm7vqx/)

**Battery Life and Connectivity**  
Bluetooth 4.1 ensures a strong and seamless connection within a 30-foot range. I tested it walking around my house, and there wasn‚Äôt a single hiccup in performance. The claimed 10-hour battery life felt pretty accurate during my usage. Streaming podcasts, attending calls, and binge-watching a TV series in one stretch didn‚Äôt drain the battery too quickly. A full charge from zero takes roughly six hours, which might feel a tad lengthy for some. For short travels or gym sessions, the battery never left me hanging, but if you‚Äôre someone who forgets to recharge often, this could be slightly inconvenient.

**Controlling the Experience**  
One feature I‚Äôve come to adore is the inline remote. Adjusting the volume, skipping tracks, or activating Google Assistant is as simple as pressing a button, all while my phone stays tucked away in my pocket. The built-in microphone also provides decent call clarity. Testing it during a Zoom meeting, I was told my voice sounded clear, although some background noise was slightly detectable. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking by any means, but it does the job. 

**Good Aspects**  
- Reliable noise isolation creates an immersive listening experience.  
- Secure and customizable fit with plenty of options for ear tips.  
- Balanced audio with a focus on clarity and non-overwhelming bass.  
- Handy inline controls for better usability on the go.

**Limitations**  
- Charging time is on the longer side at approximately six hours.  
- Micro-USB charging feels outdated compared to newer USB-C options.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking up the JLab JBuds Pro against its rivals like Skullcandy Ink‚Äôd or Anker Soundcore Spirit Sports, there are clear distinctions. When it comes to cost efficiency and secure fit, these wireless earbuds outperform many others in the same segment. The Cush Fins stand out compared to Skullcandy‚Äôs softer, less grippy design, especially during workout sessions. Anker, however, takes the lead in water resistance. If frequent workouts or exposure to elements like rain are part of your routine, you might want to reconsider the JBuds Pro. However, neither competitor comes close in balancing cost and sound quality as efficiently as these earbuds do.

**True Value for the Everyday Listener**  
Balancing audio clarity, comfort, and practical features, these earbuds feel worth every penny for casual users like myself. They‚Äôre perfect for those who want decent sound quality without overcommitting to hefty prices. The lack of advanced features like active noise cancellation or USB-C charging is noticeable but not deal-breaking. Comparable earbuds at this price point often sacrifice build quality or sound balance‚Äîthis product succeeds in achieving both.

1kbpzun,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kbpzun/how_should_i_take_this/,How should I take this?,"So, over the past few months, I‚Äôve been hanging out with a guy I‚Äôve grown pretty smitten with. I‚Äôve been respecting a boundary he kind of put up early on, but now I‚Äôm unsure whether I should be honest with him about how I feel or just give up and focus on being a really good friend.

Some background:
Joseph (32M) and I (28M) have been close friends for about six years now. We have a mutual friend, Jake(31m). Jake originally met Joseph first, and we only saw each other occasionally when hanging out with him. We made small talk and nothing more.

Then last year, around October, Jake brought a guy as a date to a gathering. Up until then, I had assumed he was straight because he had been dating a girl‚Äîwhich I now realize was a pretty close-minded assumption. From October through the end of the year, Jake and I started connecting more deeply and went beyond just small talk.

At a New Year‚Äôs party hosted by Joseph, after a night of drinking and hanging out, things took a turn. As the night was wrapping up, Joseph randomly asked‚Äîright in front of everyone‚Äîif Jake and I were each other‚Äôs type. I wasn‚Äôt shy and said yes. To my pleasant surprise, Jake felt the same way.

The next morning, I messaged Jake:

Me:
‚ÄúHey, good afternoon! I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I‚Äôm feeling a bit hungover myself, but I‚Äôm sure some water and Advil will help, haha. As I mentioned last night, you‚Äôre definitely my type. Would you be interested in going on a date?‚Äù

Jake:
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely feeling it‚Äîhad to drag myself out of bed this morning. You‚Äôre also my type, but I‚Äôm not really in a place to be going on dates again. I got out of a 3-year relationship a few months back. I‚Äôd still like to hang out sometime though. Wanna grab coffee early next week?‚Äù

Since then, we‚Äôve hung out, played video games online, and gotten to know each other better. Everything felt easy‚Äîuntil about a week ago, when Joseph told me he ran into Jake on a date with another guy. Jake later told him that they were Tinder dates.

I‚Äôm not jealous, exactly‚Äîit‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄúOkay, so you are going on dates now.‚Äù Should I take that as a sign that Jake only sees me as a friend?

I want to ask him directly, but I don‚Äôt want to come across as pressuring him. I think part of why I‚Äôm so drawn to him is because I didn‚Äôt meet him through an app‚Äîwhich I hate and never seem to have luck with.

To anyone who is still expecting and nervous about becoming a parent, I hope this positive post helps you!

A year ago I was 29, with no direction in life. I had a decent job at home depot, and I was just sorting of floating along. I left Denver 6 years ago to live in a small town in Kansas with my dad because I was partying way too much and struggling with substance abuse and other mental health problems.

I met my boyfriend right after moving here, but we both had personal things to work on and the universe just hadn't aligned things for us yet. Fast forward to June 22nd, 2024, we start dating. I get pregnant in July. Holy shit, we are doing this? Omg, we are going to BECOME PARENTS?! No fucking way. I'm still a child myself. In no way am I ready for this, but we have 9 months to get ready!

9 months later, 2 baby showers and a lot of preparation, we are ready for our beautiful baby girl. Our love has grown so much. Boyfriend stepped it up and got a great job working for the city, and went to get his CDL today. I get 12 weeks of paid maternity leave. (Go Home Depot!!) I had a really easy delivery, baby is perfectly healthy and SO CUTE. Instincts kick in. Taking care of her is the light of my life. I'm breastfeeding and it's tiring, she lives on my boobs, but I love every minute of it. It's not as hard as I thought it was going to be. My boyfriend is so supportive, he's a great dad, does everything to take care of us when he's home. My love for him is so intense, I want 10 more babies with this man.

I was convinced something would be wrong with our baby, we would struggle really hard to navigate being parents to a fragile newborn, the baby would be colicky, or just any and everything bad would happen. It hasn't. 

This morning I got up with the baby and finished nursing her while enjoying a cup of coffee when I heard the trash truck come by. Our town is only 2,000 people so we see daddy driving around throughout the day. We stepped on the front porch to wave to him. He smiled so big back at us. I hugged my baby close to my chest, looked around, and wondered, ""how the hell did I end up in this cute little town with this adorable little baby and this picture perfect little life?"" It's not too good to be true. Having this child was the scariest, best thing that has ever happened to me.",6,1746043569.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

so i took my first dose of methylphenidate 18mg last Sunday, there was a subtle positive effect on my verbal fluency and a bit of motivation, no euphoria or anything like that, i also always drink 2 shots of espresso after lunch so after the medication in 1.5-2 hrs.

The problem was i had a severe crash 10 hours after the medication, I've never experienced panic in my life before so i didn't know that this crash was something similar to panic attack, i was restless with shallow breaths, chatty, suddenly extremely hungry and fatigued and i wanted to sleep but my heart was racing and extremely tensed from the inside, everything subsidised in few hours.

The following days i had a similar crash but less intense, the problem is i was experiencing this crash earlier every day, the second day i had the crash 7 hours after the med, third day it was 6 hours later! Today is my forth day and i took the medication about 4 hours ago, im so concerned about the episode when it comes cuz i dont have anytime to waste now, i went to the polyclinic when i failed to manage the episode myself in my second day and they advised me to contact my doctor but i didn't because it was late.

The third day (yesterday) i was able to manage slightly with cold shower and breathing exercises but i went just to ask what can i do more and i was scared if the episode will come again, also the other dr there advised me to contact my dr, so i did today and my dr asked to stop drinking a coffee after taking the stimulant and take only one shot late in the day every other day.

The problem is i haven't had my coffee today and in only 4-4.5 hours post medication, im currently a bit restless and im scared today it will come even earlier. I just need something that i can do at home to not waste more time during the crash, other than cold showers and breathing exercises.",1,1746043565.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

For example, I recently went out with 2 men that shared this feed back with me. The first one looked at me like he admired me / made googly eyes at me the entire time we were together at a local coffee shop. I found him to be extremely attractive and I liked his energy which obviously made me feel shy and quiet. 

Well I ended up rejecting him because I figured we have different communication styles and it didnt seem like we were too compatible. I was nice about it and admitted I liked him but we didn‚Äôt seem to be on the same page. I just don‚Äôt want to waste time I guess. 

He then got upset and said I came off as weird because of how shy I was which didn‚Äôt make sense because he looked like he liked me the entire time. but i am in fact quite shy, so it made me feel bad. I can be a bit awkward when I am attracted to someone it‚Äôs just how I am.

Now onto another guy that actually made me feel really really bad because I met him in my neighborhood and he seemed really interested in me at first. He is extremely extroverted and I am very shy at first which he later said was a dealbreaker for him. I am disappointed because I would see him around our area and admired him from afar before he asked me out.

I know im in my 30s so I know I should be more sure of myself but the thing is that I only get this shy when I like someone. Has anyone else experienced anything like this before? Is it not acceptable to be shy as a woman this age? This is my first time dating after my last break up years ago so I don‚Äôt know what I am doing.

I met a female play partner on a popular fetish social network platform. We linked up through a mutual interest of CNC (consent to no consent) play/sex. For those who aren't familiar, CNC is a power exchange dynamic where one person overpowers the other and forces themself onto the other, in what appears to be a non-consentual manner, but in reality both parties have given consent, and consent can be revoked at any point, either with safe words or gestures.

We met for coffee one afternoon to make sure the physical attraction was there face-to-face. It was instant and intense. We wound up making out in her car for a good 20 minutes before parting ways. After that we texted and talked for a couple weeks. We discussed boundaries, limits; hard and soft, safety protocol, protection, and the exact scenario in which she wanted to experience our first session together.

I won't give the exact details in which she wanted things to happen, but she was very precise about certain details, including how I would dress, some of the things I would say, and the order in which I would do things. In other words, while I was definitely going to seem in control during the act itself, she was very much in control of the planning.

The play date itself was absolutely amazing, for both of us. Everything went exactly as planned, no safe words were needed, and afterwards she immediately wanted to schedule another date. For several months we explored all our desires, both with CNC, and other kinks. We were insatiable for one another. Things were so good, that we began vanilla dating in addition to our kink dynamic. Over time we developed feelings for one another, and eventually became exclusive.

On Easter she invited me over to meet her family officially, although I had been part of a video chat with her mom previously. Everything went pretty well, but at one point in the afternoon I found myself outside with her Aunt and sister. They were both commenting on how happy she seemed with me, and her Aunt made the point of saying how happy she was that her niece was finally ""safe"". I thought it was an odd word choice, but her sister echoed the sentiment. There was a look of understanding that they shared with one another that while noticeable, they were clearly not going to expand on.

Later that night I brought this up in a very casual way to my partner. She almost immediately broke down crying. I didn't press her, but rather consoled her and held her close. Eventually she confessed that she had been the victim of multiple sexual assaults, including being molested by a deceased family member, being date r*ped in college, and being repeatedly r*ped by an ex. I didn't pry, but she did volunteer enough information to start connecting some dots. I already knew her ex's name from previous conversations, and later I checked her social media and was surprised to see that she was still friends with him on Instagram and FB, and that they even occasionally commented on one another's posts. This was concerning, but I understand that people deal with things in their own way, but still, it kind of started me spiraling. Then one night after we'd both had quite a few drinks and passed out, I was woken in the middle of the night to the sound of her furiously masturbating. At first I pretended to still be sleeping, but as she got louder I had to acknowledge that I'd been woken up. She immediately seized the opportunity and demanded that I r*pe her so she could cum. We'd never used that word before in our CNC play, it was one of my hard limits. It was jarring. I was thrown off and uncomfortable, and frankly I was still drunk and so was she. I was not comfortable at all, and so I used one of our safe words to say that this wasn't the right time. She lost her shit, called me some choice words, then stormed out of the bedroom. She slept on the sofa. The next morning we barely said two words to one another.

Later that week she said she needed to see me. We got together and she came clean about some information that really put things into perspective. She told me the details of her date r*pe in college, and to my shock they mimicked our first CNC encounter to nearly every detail. She went on to tell me that while her ex was physically abusive to her, she claims to have manipulated him into being that way with her. She said that being forced is the only way she can experience sexual gratification. This really came as a surprise to me, since while we did regularly engage in CNC, we also regularly had what I'd describe as aggressive, but otherwise normal sex. She admitted that while she did enjoy those times, she was unable to finish without the element of force.

So now I'm pretty confused. While everything we've done has been consensual, I do feel manipulated. I don't know how I can continue with this dynamic knowing what I know. To complicated matters, she told me that things would need to escalate for her continued enjoyment. She wants me to be significantly rougher with her, to be more verbally degrading, to incorporate darker elements, such as kidnapping role-play, and that she wants to do away with our safe words. In her own words, she said she needs me to regularly forcefully r*pe her. I can't do what she's asking. Even though technically she's consenting to this behavior, it takes consent from both parties, and this is so far outside my comfort zone, that I can't comply. I explained this and she told me how disappointed she was, that she'd thought she'd found the one with me. I told her that I thought she needed some therapy, and she tried using it as a bargaining chip, saying she'd try therapy if I'd be willing to escalate our CNC play. Now I'm totally lost. I definitely want her to get help, but not at the cost of losing my soul, which is what I feel she's asking me to do.

How do I move forward without violating her trust or my integrity? My feelings for her are very strong. Other than this current situation, we've never had so much as a single disagreement. In other words, she's otherwise amazing. I'm in so deep.",1,1746043107.0,sexadvise,1,1.0,False

1kbps1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kbps1m/what_worked_for_me_waking_up_earlier/,What worked for me: waking up earlier,"Hi friends. I've been a night owl my whole life, up until about a month ago. I used to wake up about half an hour before work (wfh), get coffee, and grumble through my day. Then if I had the energy I would work out at night, skipping if I had a social event. I'd also peak my energy mid day, the hottest time to run or do anything outside. 

Well about a month ago I decided to try a 75HARD. I failed, and keep failing, but the requirement to do 2 45 minute workouts a day got me thinking that I really need to wake up early to get this done. Even though I keep failing, the 2x45s have stuck with me.

I also knew I would never wake up early if I didn't go to bed early, so I decided to stop doomscrolling at night and do some self-hypnosis starting at 10 pm (usually my peak energy time). 

Basically, I found that if I set up my day from the night before rather than wait til I'm ""naturally"" sleepy, I can go to bed earlier. I've kept this up for a month now, and the benefits for weight loss have been multifold:

* I'm less depressed because I tend to get more sunlight, so I move more. (This is a chicken and egg problem and my heart goes out to all you who are still dealing with depression.)
* I get movement in first thing in the morning, setting my day up for more activity.
* I don't snack at night.
* I have time to prepare a breakfast rather than grab a granola bar. 
* I've been starting work earlier so I feel less guilty taking walking breaks.
* ""eating the frog first"" (doing chores early) so I can relax in the evening, making it easier to fall asleep and get 8 hrs of sleep most days.
* I watch less TV. Went from maybe 2-3 hrs a day to 1.

I'm not logging calories, but I went from losing 1 lb a month to losing 2.5 in the last month.

Has anyone else found that shifting your sleep schedule helped you in this journey, or have you been happy to stick to night owl habits? ",3,1746043040.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

***Washington***

***2014***

The worst part wasn‚Äôt the silence. It was how quickly people learned to live inside it.

Owen Geralds sat in the back row of the stake high council room, hands folded, wedding ring cold against his knuckle. The chairs had been rearranged‚Äîno longer the half-circle they used for planning meetings, but a line. A row of obedience. He was two seats down from where he used to sit. No one looked at him. Not even Ethan. Especially not Ethan.

President Hayes had opened the meeting with a scripture from Doctrine and Covenants, something about order and stewardship, the kind of passage that felt holy until you heard it in a voice that made your stomach turn. The prayer had come next. Then the sustained callings.

Owen waited for the release announcement that never came. He wasn‚Äôt mentioned.

No thanks for years of service. No formal release. No reassignment. Just a new counselor stepping into his old chair and a note passed to him at the end:



***Thank you for your continued faithfulness.***



He had smiled as he folded it, then crushed it slowly in one fist.

That was the last sacrament meeting he ever attended.

The garage was quieter than usual that night.

Sawdust clung to the workbench. A hammer was left out. One of Dean‚Äôs old wooden Pinewood Derby cars sat on a shelf, chipped paint and all. Owen stood there staring at it, thumb pressed hard against his palm. His hand still ached from earlier.

The drywall bore the mark of that ache‚Äîfresh, indented, splintered in a perfect arc of knuckles.

Langley showed up unannounced three days later

Owen had been fixing a gate out back when the truck pulled in‚Äînew model, dark red, still smelled like a showroom. Langley climbed out, sunglasses on, jaw tight. He walked right up without saying hello.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve both been in this too long to pretend,‚Äù Langley said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôll just ask: Are you trying to make noise, or are you just losing your grip?‚Äù

Owen didn‚Äôt answer. Langley stepped closer. ‚ÄúBecause if it‚Äôs the first one, you should know‚Ä¶ noise doesn‚Äôt last around here. We handle things quietly. Always have.‚Äù

Then, calm as Sunday, Langley reached out‚Äîlike to dust off Owen‚Äôs collar‚Äîand clipped him just under the eye with a knuckle.

‚ÄúBe careful where you lean,‚Äù he said, smiling. ‚ÄúBalance is everything in carpentry. And callings.‚Äù Owen didn‚Äôt report it. Didn‚Äôt ice it. Just stared in the mirror that night and watched the bruise rise beneath his eye like a tide.

The last good picture of Owen Geralds was taken a month before he died.

He was standing in the garage beside the router table, grease on his jeans, holding up a tray of freshly cut dovetails for the cabinets he never finished. Dean‚Äôs mom had snapped it without warning. He was squinting in the light, one eye slightly swollen, knuckles raw and red.

Dean hadn‚Äôt noticed at the time. Not really. But when he looked at the photo later‚Äîafter the funeral, after the sealed casket, after the eulogy that never said his father‚Äôs name more than twice‚Äîhe saw it all. The signs. The truth behind the silence.

Owen had been unraveling. Quietly. Carefully.



He was called into the Stake offices midweek and told there were ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù about his recent remarks in Sunday School‚Äîconcerns about tone, not doctrine. Language that could be ‚Äúmisunderstood.‚Äù

Ethan Hayes was there alongside Brother Langley and another counselor‚Äînewly sustained, freshly minted in a crisp white shirt and soft smile. They spoke like HR reps, not shepherds. One-handed Owen a printed sheet titled *Strategic Stewardship Review*.

At the top, in clean font:



***Area of Concern: Ideological Drift***

***Recommendation: Temporary Reassignment***

***Status: Observing Period (Discreet)***



He didn‚Äôt yell or argue. He folded the paper, slid it into his back pocket, and walked out without shaking hands.

That night, he punched the garage wall so hard the drywall cracked. He didn‚Äôt wrap his hand. Just rinsed it and kept working.

Then he sat in his truck with the door closed, engine off, and stared at the ceiling like he was trying to keep something from spilling over.

He pulled out his phone.

The call log showed a missed call from Dean two days earlier‚Äîprobably just checking in. Owen hesitated. Then he hit record.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúJust me.‚Äù

There was a pause. Like he thought about deleting it mid-message. But he kept going.

‚ÄúI had a meeting today. With President Hayes. Behind closed doors. Just him and me.‚Äù

Another pause.

‚ÄúHe asked me to go along with something. Said it‚Äôd be ‚Äòtemporary stewardship,‚Äô nothing official. Said it would help the stake. Help you.‚Äù

His breath hitched once, audible through the static.

‚ÄúI told him no. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to be used.‚Äù

A shaky exhale.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll say next. What story you‚Äôll hear. But I want you to know‚Ä¶ I love you, son. No matter what they tell you next.‚Äù

The message ended there‚Äîabrupt and uneven.

Owen didn‚Äôt replay it. Just sat in the quiet, the phone still in his hand, before sliding it face down on the dash.



That weekend, Nora took the girls to her parents for a weekend visit. Sister Myler brought a small casserole. Said she the spirit had given her the feeling that Owen could use some comfort food. Her dish was cheesy and smelled like thyme and smoked paprika. Owen reheated it for his dinner, trying to bury his feelings in the richness of food.



***Day One***

The next morning, Nora stopped in to check on him. He looked pale and sick, so Nora took his temperature. Owen didn‚Äôt argue. He was feeling off‚Äîjust a little nauseous. Probably the rich food, he told himself.



***Day Two***

He couldn‚Äôt shake the headache. The shop lights looked too bright. His hands trembled when he tried to sign off an invoice. When he looked up from the workbench, the world had a yellow tint‚Äîlike someone had smeared Vaseline on the windows.

He rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúJust tired,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúWorn out.‚Äù

That night, he sat alone on the porch and tried to write a letter to Dean. Tried, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Every sentence felt like a trap. Every thought was a ticking clock.



***Day Three***

He threw up in the sink before breakfast. Couldn‚Äôt keep coffee down. The room spun when he stood too fast.

Nora begged him to go to urgent care, but he brushed it off. ‚ÄúBug going around,‚Äù he said.

She caught him talking to himself in the garage later, muttering phrases under his breath like he was arguing with ghosts. He waved it off. But she noticed how pale he looked. How he held the wall when he walked.



***Day Four***

He collapsed. Just for a moment‚Äîon the floor of the kitchen, right beside the fridge. His fingers twitched. Pulse barely there. Nora called 911.

By the time the paramedics arrived, he was awake again, embarrassed. ‚ÄúDehydration,‚Äù he lied. ‚ÄúStress.‚Äù They ran a portable EKG. The tech‚Äôs eyes narrowed, but he didn‚Äôt say much, but he recommended following up with a doctor. Owen nodded, but never went.

That night, in the quiet, he finally opened his old mission journal and tore out a single page. On the back, in shaking pen:



***If obedience is the root of virtue, let it be to God‚Äînot the men who pretend to speak for Him.***



He folded it. Slid it into a used envelope. Wrote ***For Dean*** on the front. Then he slid it into the false bottom of his scriptures‚Äîthe same set Dean would inherit.



***Day Five***

He died before sunrise. Nora found him slumped on the couch, the TV still glowing with an old baseball game. His hand was curled around a photo of Dean in Ukraine, taped to the back of the *Stewardship Review* form he never turned in.

The official cause was heart failure, but there were no autopsy results released. Just a closed casket and a tight-lipped bishop. A congregation full of eyes that wouldn‚Äôt meet Nora‚Äôs.

etc...

I am always perplexed by these because personally I consider my ability to forgive to be my greatest acquired skill and the one that has been most useful to me. And I say this as someone with at least one more useful acquired skill - I am a tech worker with FAANG.

I‚Äôve been in the process of leaving my marriage, but I keep second-guessing myself. I don‚Äôt know what this was. It doesn‚Äôt look like the kind of abuse I went through in my past. But it also doesn‚Äôt feel like love anymore. I keep trying to figure out if I‚Äôm exaggerating, if I‚Äôm being unfair, or if I‚Äôm finally seeing something I couldn‚Äôt admit before.

My husband is very generous. He brought me coffee every morning. He paid the bills. He did the grocery shopping. He handled logistics. But he also told me I couldn‚Äôt make coffee properly. That I didn‚Äôt know how to shop. That I was bad with money. He tracked my car and mocked me when I missed a turn. He installed cameras all over our house but refused to lock the doors or set the alarm. He insisted on leaving doors open at night, and when I said that made me feel unsafe, he said I was paranoid. He constantly looked over my shoulder when I was texting or using my phone. It didn‚Äôt feel like love‚Äîit felt like surveillance. But I still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a fair way to describe it.

He would walk in on me when I was naked, on the toilet, or in the bathtub. When I asked for privacy or locked the bathroom door, he called me controlling. When I tried to set boundaries, he said I was rejecting him or hurting his feelings.

Sometimes he would yell, slam doors, punch walls. He drove dangerously when angry, even with our kids in the car. Other times he would completely shut down and ignore me. Then he‚Äôd swing back and be affectionate and helpful, like nothing had happened. I was constantly off-balance.

There were many times I moved into the guestroom or stopped speaking to him for days. Not to punish him, but because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. He scared me when we argued. I couldn‚Äôt think. My nervous system would shut down. I‚Äôd freeze. I have PTSD, and I had just come out of an 18-year abusive marriage. I felt like I was constantly defending myself‚Äîthere, and then again here. If I couldn‚Äôt remember everything perfectly, he would use it against me. He told me my silence was dismissive. That I was stonewalling him. But I wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt him‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt feel safe enough to speak.

In recovery, I‚Äôve learned to manage my PTSD better. I‚Äôve learned to speak up. I‚Äôve started to set boundaries. I don‚Äôt yell. I don‚Äôt explode. But I‚Äôve finally begun to name what‚Äôs happening, and every time I do, it somehow gets turned around on me. Suddenly he‚Äôs the victim. He sulks. Shuts down. Scowls at me. Tells me I‚Äôm taking everything away from him. If I need space, or rest, or time to think, I feel like I‚Äôm being punished for it.

He says he loves our kids, but he undermined my parenting constantly. I have ADHD. My kids have special needs. He treated that like a flaw in all of us. If I advocated for them, he said I was enabling them. He said they were manipulating me. But when I defended them, he said I was undermining him. The house became tense. My kids fight. They‚Äôre scared of being corrected or blamed. They‚Äôre even starting to micromanage me, like they‚Äôve absorbed the atmosphere. Every time I try to create peace, he blocks it. He complains about every solution. But he also wants constant affection and attention from me, like none of the other chaos exists. But he‚Äôs also an involved step-father. He‚Äôs taken over so much of the visible parenting, but I do all the stuff no one notices. My kids now defer to him for everything. I feel like he stole my relationship with them. He says my drinking did. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair. I didn‚Äôt have a drinking problem for 80% of their lives. 

He used therapy language to explain away his behavior. If I made connections to past trauma, he said I was just projecting. If I got upset, he said it was my PTSD, not his actions. He said he was scared I didn‚Äôt really love him. That I‚Äôd used him as a soft landing after my divorce. He insisted on endless emotional conversations‚Äîhours and hours‚Äîwhere the subject kept shifting until I felt totally lost. When I asked to stop, he pushed harder. When I finally snapped, he broke down crying. Confused. Desperate. Like I‚Äôd harmed him. It was so destabilizing.

We had agreed I would go stay with a friend out of state for a month. He helped me pack. After I left, he sabotaged my plan. He says he panicked. But from where I stand, it didn‚Äôt look like panic‚Äîit looked strategic. He took steps that could have resulted in me losing custody of my kids. He called the police, my friends, my doctors, and said he was worried about my mental health. He doesn‚Äôt know that I know what he did.

I hadn‚Äôt stood up to him sooner because‚Ä¶ he was supposed to be the safe one. I couldn‚Äôt admit to myself‚Äîand I especially couldn‚Äôt let my ex-husband find out‚Äîthat I had walked out of one abusive marriage and into another. That I‚Äôd put my kids in another unsafe situation. I knew my husband for a long time before we moved in together. I never imagined he could become the person he‚Äôs become. I feel like I was tricked.

I couldn‚Äôt fight two men at once. So I tried to be better. I tried to be less sensitive. I tried to adjust to his way of doing everything. I tried to keep the peace. Overlook the red flags. Bend and twist myself into someone who wouldn‚Äôt be mocked or scrutinized. It didn‚Äôt work. Everything I did was wrong. Everything my kids did was wrong. But he was also so happy sometimes. So loving. So generous. How can someone be both kind and cruel? Easy and hard. How can someone say you‚Äôre everything to them and still make you feel like you‚Äôre never enough?

During the pandemic, I started drinking heavily‚Äîin the closet. It was the only place I wasn‚Äôt on camera. I‚Äôm ashamed of it. But I also know it was a response to being trapped and scared. I know I‚Äôm responsible for my drinking. I also know that both of my marriages played a huge role in why I spiraled.

I didn‚Äôt leave because I stopped loving him. I left because I couldn‚Äôt survive in that house anymore. Because I started to feel like I was disappearing. Because I started to believe I was going crazy. And now that I‚Äôve taken some space, I‚Äôm finally trying to understand what happened.

His family thinks he‚Äôs a saint. They act like I don‚Äôt exist or I‚Äôm a gold digger. They think he stood by me. But he didn‚Äôt. I did it all alone. I gave up everything to be here. I have no family left. He makes much more money than I do. I can‚Äôt even afford an attorney. I feel like I‚Äôm standing at the edge of something I still can‚Äôt name.

This doesn‚Äôt look like the abuse I‚Äôve been through before. But it also doesn‚Äôt feel like love. I don‚Äôt know what this was. I just know that I feel erased, exhausted, and confused. I‚Äôve been trying to fix this for years. I‚Äôve gone to therapy. We are in marriage counseling. I‚Äôve gotten sober. I‚Äôve begged for peace. But nothing ever really changed-it got worse‚Ä¶I think. I‚Äôm just not sure. It feels worse. It just feels intolerable. Death by a thousand cuts. 

If you‚Äôve experienced anything like this‚Äîif any of this sounds familiar‚Äîplease tell me what you think.

It's surprisingly hard to find good information on nuts in drinks, so I spent some time to compile a list of common allergens (excluding the grains) in drinks for people to hopefully use!

* Liquers:
   * Amaretto (many use almonds -- Disaronno does not)
   * Orgeat/ Falernum (almond syrups)
   * Kahlua Ready-made-cocktails (normal kahlua is fine)
   * Galliano
   * Frangelico (hazelnut)
   * Creme de Noix (almond)
   * Nocello, nocino (walnut)

* Cocktails:
   * Flips contain eggs to make the drink foamy
   * Sours oftentimes include an egg
   * Pay attention to the mixers/ask the bartender if you're uncertain

All in all, if you have allergies and are worried about drinks, do your best research and use discretion. The safest options will always be tequila, straight/straight bourbon whiskey, soju, sake, white/silver rum, and pure vodka.

Plus, the distilling process is supposed to get rid of the proteins that cause the allergic reactions, but I would still be cautious and use discretion.

When Fabian noticed me eyeing the letter, he asked with a casual smile, ""What's up?""  
  
I shook my head. ""Nothing.Just noticed the monogram‚Äîpretty unique. Never seen anything like it before.""  
  
Fabian raised an eyebrow, explaining smoothly, ""My skin's sensitive to most fabrics. I get all my underwear custom-made.""  
  
At the time, I didn't think twice about it.  
  
Now, this post was sending my mind into a spiral of doubt.  
  
The poster kept digging herself deeper in the comments  
  
""Everyone needs to chill the hell out.""  
  
""He's still single technically, and we haven't hooked up or anything, so how is this cheating?""  
  
""Someone asked if I mark his new underwear too. Duh! He ships every new pair to me first.""  
  
""Does his girlfriend know? God no.""  
  
""We're super careful. Nobody has a clue.""  
  
""Haha I've been doing this since I was fourteen, FYI.""  
  
""Relax, I'm deleting this post soon anyway.""  
  
The thread was blowing up with strangers calling her out.I didn't join in, but I couldn't shake the creeping suspicion.  
  
Then I caught myself‚Äîwas I seriously going to question my fianc√© because of some random internet stranger? Get a grip!  
  
The poster's location showed London, for crying out loud.  
  
Everyone in our social circle knows Fabian has always been Mr. Perfect‚Äînever have a scandal. He's a person who buttons his shirt all the way to the top..  
  
When someone once asked why he was so proper, he just said, ""Quality over quantity.""  
  
After graduating from Wharton, Fabian launch his company.  
  
His leadership team is 50/50 men and women, with female employees making up the majority overall.  
  
The benefits are insane comprehensive healthcare, flexible hours and sick days, six months of parental leave for all genders, and actual vacation time people can take without guilt.  
  
He even created the OWL initiative ""Oracle Women's Leadership"" specifically designed for advancing women.  
  
His executive assistant, Zoe, just had her second baby. When I stopped by his office, she brought me coffee.  
  
""We always wondered what kind of woman would end up with Fabian,"" she said. ""Meeting you, I get it now.""  
  
She got emotional talking about him.  
  
""A man like Fabian has women swooning over him constantly, but I've worked for him for years and never once seen him even flirt back.""  
  
She probably thought I was checking up on him.  
  
Then she opened up about her marriages.  
  
""If Fabian hadn't gotten his legal team to help with my custody battle, my ex would have destroyed me. I never would have met my current husband or had my baby.""  
  
""Fabian's the real deal. You could visit his company if you have time.""  
  
I nodded, sipping my coffee without commenting.  
  
My dad always said there are four ways to judge a man  
  
First, how he handles responsibility‚Äîdoes he step up or make excuses?  
  
Second, how he acts when things go wrong‚Äîwatch out for the ones who never show frustration.  
  
Third, his friends‚Äîsometimes, men hang out with jerks, but they don‚Äôt do it often..  
  
Fourth, his family‚Äîhow his parents treated each other is his blueprint for relationships.  
  
Fabian aced all four tests.  
  
My parents enthusiastically approved the match.  
  
We started dating with marriage as the clear goal.  
  
Last summer, I was vacationing in Anglesey when my period hit early with crippling pain. I'd lost my meds and passed out from the intensity.  
  
My new assistant, Sara, completely freaked out.  
  
Fabian, who was supposed to be in LA for meetings, somehow showed up out of nowhere, calmly carried me to bed, and stayed up all night accompanying me.  
  
That night, a typhoon slammed the island. The resort flooded, and housekeeper evacuated everyone to higher ground.  
  
A ceiling fan broke loose in the chaos and came crashing down. Without hesitation, Fabian covered me with his body, getting a nasty gash across his forehead.  
  
I didn't even realize he was hurt. He never mentioned it, just carried me on his back through knee-deep water.  
  
His voice stayed steady""I've got you!babe.""  
  
""We're going to be fine.""  
  
Looking at his usually perfect hair now plastered to his bleeding forehead, I thought, I'm falling in love with him. This is real.  
  
In our world, marriages are business mergers.Genuine feelings is completely worthless.  
  
But that night, I genuinely believed I'd found the exception.  
  
Our engagement was announced the following month.  
  
Thinking about all this now, I felt stupid for letting some boring post get to me.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The day of our engagement party arrived.  
  
Though it wasn't the wedding yet, both families had gone all out with a formal cocktail reception at the Sullivans estate.  
  
Business associates and lifestyle journalists from both sides showed up to clink glasses and network‚Äîthese events were as much about business as celebration.  
  
My makeup artist makes up for me while gossiping about Boston's elite. ""You two are genetic lottery winners!""  
  
I gave a polite smile, eyes downcast.  
  
My best friend, Vanessa, was running interference with the guests while texting me  
  
""Update I've vetted your man thoroughly. Fabian's reputation is SOLID ""  
  
""Even with all these thirsty socialites circling him before engagement, he's maintaining boundaries!""  
  
""You seriously lucked out!""  
  
""How did we both end up in business marriages but yours comes with actual feelings??This is so unfair!""  
  
Vanessa had been matched with the Pierce family's heir last winter.  
  
She'd confided in me repeatedly that Marcus Pierce had no sexual desire for her at all.  
  
It sounds ridiculous, but Fabian and I have never actually made sex, even during our most heated moments.  
  
When I straddled his lap, wearing nothing but sexy lingerie,he's still completely unruffled.  
  
He'd even said with that serious look  
  
""I'm old-fashioned about some things,this isn‚Äôt good for you.""  
  
Seeing my frustration, he'd kissed the tip of my nose  
  
""Disappointed?""  
  
""Trust me, baby, I can make you scream without crossing that particular line.""  
  
""...Let me show you instead...""

Apparently tomorrow it‚Äôs going to be the hottest day so far in the year which is great , but in my case it kinda isn‚Äôt.

My studio can get veeeeeery warm in the summer , and I cannot install AC or proper ventilation.
however I have a job to finish and tomorrow is the best day to work on it according to my schedule.
So I thought of spending my day outside of studio , just bringin my laptop somewhere cool where I can spend 4-6 hours starting from 2pm.
I might end up sounding weirdly specific , maybe I am ! (I am) but I‚Äôm just looking for suggestions so ride with me please.

Ideal candidate has:

- power outlet for my laptop and soundcard

- it‚Äôs somewhat interesting to look at / be in (I don‚Äôt wanna be in a generic cafe all afternoon, London is full of great place with cafes , like the VnA for example. Something inspiring basically or as close as)

- it‚Äôs not a silent place e.g. library

- it‚Äôs not insanely loud e.g. somewhere with live music or loud radio ( open headphones don‚Äôt isolate me much)

- (possibly) has AC (I don‚Äôt wanna fry)

- has WIFI

- has decently comfortable seating , not a bar stool or I‚Äôll basically die

Bonus points:
Churches , museums , big spaces , brutalist , high ceiling , decent food and coffee

In the beginning, she wasn‚Äôt ready for marriage due to a few concerns‚Äîmainly caste differences and my smoking habits. However, I was serious about her from the start and wanted to marry her.

About six months into the relationship, she went home and ended up finalizing a match with someone else, but I pleaded with her for a chance. I promised to change and convince my parents. She eventually reconsidered and agreed to be with me, and I made genuine efforts to change myself.

Later, she again told me that her parents wouldn‚Äôt allow the marriage. I reassured her that we would convince both families, and we came to a mutual understanding: I would talk to my parents first, and then she would speak to hers. I promised to speak to my parents during Diwali when I visited my hometown. I kept my promise and spoke to my sister and eventually to my mother, but she did not talk to her parents as we had agreed.

At one point, she suggested we elope or have a court marriage, but I declined as I didn‚Äôt want to hurt either family. This disagreement led to 20 days of no contact. Later, she agreed again to wait until we had both families‚Äô consent.

She got a new job in a different city and said she would speak to her parents before moving. But she didn‚Äôt, and later told me that her parents were happy now, and she didn‚Äôt want to upset them. In January 2025, she moved to the new city. We had an argument, and I canceled a trip I had planned to visit her.

In February, we had another fight because her birthday and Holi fell on the same day. I told her I would visit her after returning home for Holi (which was a mandatory family visit), and she got upset, saying I didn‚Äôt prioritize her. After that, she created a profile on a matrimonial site and started talking to 12‚Äì13 potential matches. I was hurt, but we patched things up again.

In March, I started a new job that gave me more time and flexibility. Meanwhile, I was regularly trying to convince my mother, who lives alone in my hometown. We belong to a Kshatriya family, and love marriages are not easily accepted. Still, I was hopeful. But my girlfriend kept pressuring me for a clear timeline to convince my mother, and I couldn‚Äôt give her one.

On March 8, she went home and finally spoke to her parents‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt agree, which I understood. But again, she pressured me for a timeline, saying if I didn‚Äôt have one, we should stop talking. We didn‚Äôt speak for a week, and she resumed looking for matches.

On March 15, I called her on her birthday and told her I planned to visit her. However, she again insisted on a timeline. During the time we weren‚Äôt in contact, I had a short conversation with a junior colleague who had a crush on me‚Äîjust to divert myself emotionally. I later told my girlfriend about it honestly, but she called me a cheater.

Despite that, I kept trying to convince my mother. Meanwhile, she continued talking to other prospects. On April 1, she came to visit me and asked what we should do next. I told her, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already exploring other options while I‚Äôm fighting for us at home. I just can‚Äôt give you a timeline right now.‚Äù After that, we barely spoke.

I went to Kolkata for a work event and had coffee with a colleague, where I spoke about my girlfriend. Around the same time, she met a new guy through work and went out with him, including visiting a temple together. That shattered me. Before this, I had called her and asked her to come back, telling her I was ready to move forward, but she said she couldn‚Äôt culturally fit into my community and questioned my mother. She also told me that I‚Äôm older than her in terms of life stage and maturity, so it wouldn‚Äôt work out. In frustration, I told her I had resigned from my job and was heading home.

She then asked if I would commit to her, and things seemed normal for a day. The next day, I called her again, but she was on another call. When I asked who it was, she admitted it was the same guy and said she was telling him that we had patched things up.

That day, I asked her to block him. She refused and said, ‚ÄúWho are you to tell me who to block?‚Äù Then she blocked me. I tried calling her from a friend‚Äôs phone about 25 times. She finally answered and told me she didn‚Äôt want to hear any more ‚Äúbullshit.‚Äù She blocked my friend‚Äôs number too, but before that, she said, ‚ÄúGood night, we‚Äôll talk tomorrow.‚Äù

Later, I called again, and she said, ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you letting me sleep? End this now.‚Äù

Now, I‚Äôm thinking of going to her city to try and fix things.",1,1746042421.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I am a 29 year old AFAB non binary person, in the UK and had an assessment for ADHD where the psychiatrist told me I was autistic. He couldn't diagnose me on that call but whilst I am waiting to get a proper assessment I have become so overwhelmed with so many feelings to do with this realisation.

I'm flitting between feeling like someone has pressed ""reset"" on me, to grieving my ""former self"", feeling incredibly sad for my teenage self but also recognising the diagnosis came at the right time because I think I would have found it incredibly difficult to deal with 15 years ago when there was so much more stigma. I'm noticing that so much of my life makes sense now, and behaviours I thought were just quirks were autism, and things I didn't even realise were autism was autism like behaviours I've learned by observing other people (empathy, life is shades of gray, how to behave in the corporate world to try and assimilate even though I'm doing a awful job at it). Also all my burn outs and meltdowns which have become more prevalent as I have gotten older.

I just wanted to know if anyone had any words of advice as to how to navigate this time, where I've been told I have autism but am still waiting for a diagnosis. I have a network at my job where I have connected with a few autistic AFABs who I am going to get coffees with over the next few weeks, but I want to cry every time I think about it (I know it's only been two days). I'm not sad, just so overcome with emotion.

1kbpigt,https://i.redd.it/2gzf0eqd01ye1.jpeg,Brainwave Finca La Villa Geisha,"If anyone looked at this coffee and said ""Fruit Loops?  Key Lime?  Really?""

The answer is: ""Yes, really!""

First cup.  Just pulled from the freezer.  It was stored at 17 days rest.  I wanted something different for an afternoon cup today.  I've been enjoying the Norena Galaxy Hop Carbonic Geisha from u/Brainwave_Roasters the last week or so, and I'm starting to think about making it last longer.  I love those IPA beans from Norena!

First cup.  I could smell the key lime from the initial pour.  Very balanced, but the fruit loops is definitely there too.  It's key lime juiciness; no pith bitterness.

Tomorrow I'll probably try to push it a bit sweeter with a bigger first pour.  Today, as always with a first cup of a bean, I just shoot for a balanced cup to decide if I want to change something.

Used the CC switch recipe at 85c.  15:1, 20 g.  Ode Gen 2 at 7. 150g 1st pour, close switch at 35 seconds, 150g second pour at 45 seconds.  Open switch at 2 minutes with a gentle swirl.

Another thing I love about Brainwave: seems like every coffee is really good with my ""go to"" recipe.  A bean might get marginally better brewed a little warmer, or ground a little finer, but every cup is good .  No waste .  :) ",2,1746042360.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1kbph4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualitySeek/comments/1kbph4j/is_the_moccamaster_worth_it_alongside_the/,Is the Moccamaster Worth It Alongside the Breville Barista Express for Daily Coffee Needs?,"Balancing the ritual of handcrafted espresso drinks with the convenience of a daily drip brew is a common consideration for coffee lovers, especially in households where both types of beverages are regularly enjoyed. In the situation described, the users rely on a Breville Barista Express for lattes and cortados‚Äîa versatile machine that includes a built-in conical burr grinder and steam wand, offering solid espresso performance for its price point. However, the desire for a simpler, more automated brewing option for standard black coffee in the mornings has prompted a reevaluation of their current coffee setup.

The Moccamaster by Technivorm is widely regarded for its build quality, longevity, and SCA certification for brewing at the correct temperature and time. It is especially well-suited for those who prioritize clarity and depth in their drip coffee. That said, one of its more commonly cited drawbacks is the absence of a built-in timer or programmable brewing schedule. Users who prefer to wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee often work around this limitation by employing a smart outlet or home automation solution that powers the machine at a preset time. While this is a functional workaround, it does require a willingness to accept a slightly less integrated approach than machines with built-in scheduling like the Ninja Hot & Cold XL.

Regarding grinding, the Barista Express‚Äôs built-in grinder can indeed be used for the Moccamaster, especially if convenience and space efficiency are priorities. However, it is designed with espresso grind settings in mind, meaning it may not offer the coarser, more uniform grind ideal for optimal extraction in a drip machine like the Moccamaster. While it is technically possible to use it for drip brewing, many users report inconsistent results or limited adjustment at that grind size. A dedicated burr grinder with precise control over coarser grind settings‚Äîsuch as the Baratza Encore or Fellow Ode‚Äîwould be a better long-term investment if you intend to maximize the flavor quality from the Moccamaster.

As for the Ninja Hot & Cold Brewed System, it offers considerable functionality for its price, including a built-in timer, multiple brew size settings, and the ability to brew over ice. It is a strong performer for users who prioritize convenience and versatility. However, when it comes to build quality, heating consistency, and brew precision, it does not rival the Moccamaster. Those who are more discerning about the taste and extraction of their drip coffee typically find the Moccamaster to deliver a superior cup, albeit at the cost of some automation.

In summary, if your mornings call for a quick and reliable drip coffee without sacrificing brew quality, the Moccamaster is a worthy companion to your Breville setup. To get the best results, investing in a dedicated burr grinder for drip coffee is advisable, though the Barista Express‚Äôs grinder can suffice in the interim. For those who prioritize convenience and features over brewing precision, the Ninja may still be an acceptable choice, but from a quality-focused standpoint, the Moccamaster holds the advantage. Ultimately, the decision hinges on how much value you place on convenience versus brew excellence.",1,1746042265.0,QualitySeek,0,1.0,False

1kbpaix,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1kbpaix/seeking_a_little_bit_of_support/,Seeking a little bit of support,"So this isn't my first time posting here. I'll try my best to be brief. I'm just hitting the 6 month mark of being out of my (37M) relationship with my ex-fianc√© (36F). We were together for 3 years, and in the beginning I was so certain this is who I wanted to spend my life with. She was so amazing to me, and understanding. We had so much in common and talked about everything. She told me I was the funniest person she ever met, and that I was the most wonderful man. She told me this was the best relationship she'd ever been in... stuff like that. But after a few months, it felt like she was complaining to me about everything, and criticizing me about everything. Suddenly I was made to feel as though all my hobbies and interests were a waste of time. If I spent 3 nights a week at her place, I should've been spending 4. If I spent 4, it should be 5. That kind of thing. If I went home on Sunday morning, she'd be upset that I didn't spend the whole weekend. I'd say things like, ""I need to go home and feed my kitty"" or that I needed to get some stuff done at home, and it would be an issue. Eventually I would cave, and invest more time and energy into meeting what I thought were her needs at the time. If I had her come out to where I live (about an hour from her), she'd tell me how it was long distance and was becoming a problem for her, or she'd tell me how we need to spend the weekend cleaning my house (house is reasonably clean for a bachelor living alone). Fact is I bought my parents' acreage when they died, and I've been cleaning up several generations worth of junk and farm equipment for years now. When I said I needed to go do stuff at my place, that's usually what I meant... though she'd come over and insist that I need to wipe down the light fixtures or windows instead.

Don't get me wrong, she was particular about a lot of things and VERY good at cleaning, so I welcomed any help I could get and had no problem shifting gears towards something she felt was important. After all, I was trying to convince her to eventually move in with me for a while (rent free I might add). When I said that though, she would often have some strange excuses as to why she couldn't. The living room windows didn't have curtains... I'd say that we can definitely choose curtains together, in fact I loved the idea of planning and executing those types of decisions with her. Eventually she just kinda settled on the idea that it was too far away, so I let it be. However I'd say that things like that, like an express refusal to build her life around me in the way that I was trying to do for her.

I started standing my ground on certain things, going out to see the friends she dubbed ""losers"" occasionally, or going to play cards with them (""cards are dumb""). Eventually she would say stuff during arguments like that she doesn't love me anymore, that she hates me... She would hang up on me on the phone if I even raised my voice or got frustrated in the smallest ways (I'm generally pretty laid back and amiable). She would shut down in person and close herself off, refusing to talk to me. Everything seemed to have to be her way or the highway, and I was always in the wrong. She seemed like she would take offense at the slightest things, and then refuse to hear me when I tried to explain my intentions. If it wasn't an apology or a promise to do better, she didn't seem to want to listen. It felt like she cut me down a lot. I remember a few specific instances, one that arose when we were being intimate. I felt like such a beaten-down dog.

My background with my family was such that I often feel like I'm the one in the wrong when being told so. It took her mom and siblings telling me how difficult they find her, to let me realize that this anguished feeling in my gut wasn't just coming from my own thoughts. She was kinda mean. However, I still felt so amazing when things were going well. I was walking on eggshells a lot, though.

Her mom died last summer, and I was in the room with her when it happened. I offered unwavering support to my ex and all of her family during that time. I barely went home. After she died, I spent a month sleeping on an air mattress on the floor just to be available if I was needed for help with something. The day that she died, my ex was already at the hospital. I slept at her place and drove up that morning. We spoke earlier and she'd asked me to bring her a coffee. I got into the city, and called her but she was busy. Obviously under a lot of stress, too. I told her I was just getting into the city, and she said to me ""just come here first"". I guess I interpreted that literally, because I skipped getting her a coffee and went right to the hospital. I called her from the parking lot, and she came down and was immediately angry with me for not bringing her the coffee. I, being the person who wants to solve the problem (or not have it be such a big issue in the first place), told her I'd go get her one and come back, or that she could come with me if she needed some air. She got in the vehicle, and just relentlessly berated me the entire drive about how thoughtless I am (about the coffee). Eventually I snapped, and I just calmly said, ""Can you please shut the f\*ck up?"" and she got out of my moving vehicle and slammed the door. I asked her not to, and she walked back to the hospital presumably and then sent me a text like ""if you want to see her you'd better come by soon, she won't make it through the day"" as if I was just going to leave town after that. I DID bring her a coffee anyways, and the rest of the day went fine (between us at least... her mom passed away). When she came to my place to collect her stuff in January, she brought this up AGAIN as if I was some thoughtless asshole because I didn't bring her a coffee. She also brought up an argument we had about child-rearing in the very first few months of our relationship. An argument that we had already moved past, where I genuinely reflected on my opinions and triggers about the subject, and presented her with a newly formed conclusion that was in alignment with hers (she wanted to be a stay at home mom, I was triggered about financial insecurities, and eventually realized I was being silly and we moved past it).

She never really seemed to hold herself accountable for all the cruel things she said, but somehow still seems to hold pain for all of these things that I've been assured by multiple people (including her family and our mutual friends) that they shouldn't have been a big enough deal to fight about. I felt like she felt offended by everything, if it wasn't exactly the way she wanted it. I remember we got into a huge fight about how traffic circles work, because I knew for a fact I was right and she was wrong (city website later confirmed this). I didn't ever want to argue, and I didn't even care if she didn't know how they worked, but in gently trying to explain and show her how the circles worked, she flat out rejected me and started pushing my buttons until I found myself yelling about something so so not worth it.

And it was always like that... for 3 years, I exhausted myself just trying to communicate with her. She'd say I'm bad at communicating or that I don't ""communicate in a way that she needs"". Now I could understand that, but I've been to work courses and college courses for communicating. I've had communication be a big part of my job. I'm not perfect at it, but I think I'm pretty good. Never really had too many complaints. When I realized that lots of other people found her difficult or impossible to communicate with, I knew it wasn't just me.

I went to three different therapists regarding my feelings and issues about us. I know she did go to some counsellor at least a few times too, and occasionally went to the doctor to ask about either antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds, but she never took them for long as they'd make her feel too tired or too nauseous. My therapists all seemed to be of the opinion that she may be afflicted with a personality disorder. Her own mom was sending me videos on NPD and borderline and asking me about it, because all she wanted was to see her daughter happy again (and she really liked me as well and thought I was good for her). My sisters think she's narcissistic, and our mutual friends have called her abusive or indicated that ""she won't budge unless she's forced to"".

With all this evidence showing me I should run for the hills, I stayed. I tried to be patient. I became more and more easily agitated and frustrated, and it culminated several times in me leaving and ghosting her for the weekend or a few days, or even breaking up with her. I'm so not proud of that, and I regret it a lot. I tried so hard to communicate like every different way I know how, and it just never felt like it was hitting the mark. So I'd leave when either I started having a panic attack, was being verbally abused, or felt like there was just no avenue to get my point across. She seemed like she didn't want to listen. After many big fights, she would just act the next day like nothing happened, or offer a vague apology like ""I'm sorry for saying harsh things."" However, there WERE glimpses of the person I felt she wanted to be... She told me once, while crying, ""I think I need to treat you better."" She would say stuff like ""I want to be better, I just don't know how."" But eventually, she just seemed to have detached or checked out of giving a crap about me.

Fast forward to the break up... She started another fight with me over something simple (I didn't rush out to help her with the two things she needed to carry in from the car when she got home from work). I had a panic attack. She mocked me, told me I wasn't gonna be any fun to be around today. I asked her to please shut up and give me a chance to breathe. She told me, ""If you had any self respect you'd just leave"". So I stood up and left. I sat in my car outside her house for like 20 minutes just trying to breathe. I was crying. She didn't come out, or call or text me or otherwise make any effort to fix it, so I drove back home. Didn't reach out all weekend, mind you neither did she. Then I texted Monday to say that something needs to change, and she just said that me leaving that time was the last straw. She broke up with me.

We had a few more attempts at trying to talk, but then she started telling me that we've talked it to death and are beating a dead horse. I'll remind you that this is my fianc√©, not just a girlfriend. I was trying to build a life with her. I was even gonna sell my acreage and use the money to buy her mom's house for us to live in.

As I said at the top, it's been 6 months now. I've consistently been trying to reach out to her. Sometimes out of desperation, sometimes out of anger or hurt. Sometimes just to invite her to go for a coffee and chat. We've had one phone conversation recently, and I told her it was nice to hear her voice. She said it back to me too, and seemed interested in reconnecting... but then she just didn't a few days later. I'm getting mixed signals. I'm being ignored. She will apologize to me for hurting me, but when I ask her if my hope that we can fix this is misplaced, she ignores it. She says mean things when angry, so I've been trying not to take the things she said during the initial breakup too seriously, but that leaves me questioning whether or not she still feels something for me. Whether she is working on herself and learning to take accountability. Hell, I've started talking to ChatGPT about it simply because I feel like I sound like a broken record when I bring it up with my friends now.

I know I need to protect my own heart and sanity, and try to move forward... but I genuinely feel like apart from all the communication troubles, I was with the person that I connect most with in the world. I wonder if she actually does want to grow, or if she was just placating. I wonder if I've just been discarded entirely, or if she is just feeling the weight and guilt of her actions and words, and isn't able to face herself or me. I wonder if she's just going through the grief of losing her mother, and using it as a distraction to maintain a sense of avoidance and indifference towards our relationship. Even 6 months on, I have tried my best to hold the door open to repair things if and when she's ready... but she won't even give me anything. She won't say, ""I still love you but you're wasting your time"", or ""I just need to figure myself out before I can approach this relationship again"". There's some warmth in her words, but never any sense that she knows what she wants.

I guess I'm just looking for some support, and some advice. I know I should just let things go, but I can't seem to. She acts as though she wanted to have a relationship with me, but my leaving is what fucked it all up, but doesn't seem to address the reasons I felt the need to do that. I've apologized so many times for leaving, but she doesn't care to apologize for the way she acted.

The other day I ran into her old roommate, and he asked how she was doing. We got to talking, and I explained the break up without going into details. He told me to fight for her, and it invigorated me to text her to ask how she's doing and to let her know I ran into him and what he'd said. She just didn't respond. I just wish I could understand what is going through her mind. Having lost my own parents, I know that grief is a deep well and it takes a long time to even feel semi-normal... but I was there by her side through all of it, and now I'm just... nothing.

I know this is a lot, and even so I can't possibly account for 3 years worth of struggles into a single post. If you want to offer anything but are looking for more of an explanation or details on anything, please feel free to ask. I know I can't keep putting my heart out there and just get ignored. I know I need to just give her space and time to do whatever she's doing, and I know I can't sit here and pine throughout it... but I don't know how to move on, and I just wanna know if it's possible she might address these issues in her own time and change. Otherwise, I worry about her mental health and well-being, because I think this sort of thing has happened in her past relationships too. I am stuck between trying not to feel like a desperate cuck, and trying to be happy with my own path outside of our relationship. I just feel so damn stuck and stagnant, like I can't even make decisions for my future without wanting to consult her for input because that's the life I was trying to build. Just felt like she fought me every step of the way, for no good reason. Never felt like she chose me, I guess. Never wanted to compromise.

We moved to PA (Kop specifically) for my new job, and are hoping that this will be our last year renting before owning a property. Having just moved here from out of state, I was hoping to pick your brains on where the ideal places for us to look are based on our interests. 

Me:
Mid-20's female, interested in all things hippie and crunchy. Love gardens and cute coffee shops and walkability. Big health nut, I do not go to bars/stay out late.  I work inperson in KOP 2x a week. Nature and the ability to go for walks in it regularly are important to me. I am happy with city parks or hiking trails. I want to live closer to philly than where I am now. 


My partner: 
Mid-20's male. Really into computers and beer. Likes nature and dogs. Doesn't go to bars on his own unless they are fun ones, ie, a video game bar. He is a swimmer and would need to live near a lap pool. Works remotely, so distance to/from Kop does not matter. Wants a single family home, dedicated suburbanite. 

Wants for both of us:
A neighborhood with sidewalks, easy access to an upscale grocery store (Wegmans, sprouts, whole foods, etc.), a driveway/garage with room for two cars. Would like a friendly neighborhood as well, where neighbors actually talk to each other. 

Schools are not a concern, as we do not have children/plan to have them.

So I want to answer that properly.

I offer free readings here because I believe in what tarot can do when it‚Äôs honest and real. I know what it means to feel lost and to find even just one voice that gets it. One voice that doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat, doesn‚Äôt sell hope, but just sits with you in the dark for a moment. That‚Äôs what I try to give. It costs me time and energy, and that‚Äôs okay, because this is sacred work to me. But it‚Äôs also work. I do it part time, but I want it to become a full-time job by the end of the year.

And if it matters to you, and you want to give something back, donations help more than I can say.

They help me keep showing up here. They help me take care of myself so I can keep holding space for others. They help me trust that this path I‚Äôve chosen, even if it‚Äôs not flashy or big or loud, means something.

If you‚Äôve felt something from a reading I‚Äôve done, and you want to say thank you in that way, you can. I don't have Cashapp or Venmo, unluckily, but I have [Paypal](https://paypal.me/blackvulturesart) and Buy Me a Coffee. Eventually, I can also give you my Revolut/bank transfer link.

The brand is iconic. The stores are beautiful. The products ‚Äî timeless.

But their **e-commerce? A total facepalm.**

Here‚Äôs what happened.

Yesterday, I ordered a pair of glasses online with **in-store pickup**.

Ray-Ban‚Äôs official website proudly screamed **‚ÄúAvailable today‚Äù** every step of the way ‚Äî on the product page, during checkout, on the store selection screen, even in the confirmation. You‚Äôd think I could grab them right after work, right?

So I did exactly that. Placed the order around lunchtime, went to their **flagship Manhattan store** in the evening.

Walked in. Beautiful lighting. Smooth layout. Staff dressed sharper than me on my best day.

And then ‚Äî boom:

>‚ÄúYour order will be ready tomorrow.‚Äù

Excuse me?

You mean after *all* those promises and ‚ÄúAvailable today‚Äù badges ‚Äî it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not?

It wasn‚Äôt some system glitch. It‚Äôs just how it works. The site **straight-up misleads** you.

And here‚Äôs the thing: **the in-store experience is excellent.** The people there are pros. The store is slick.

But the **digital side of Ray-Ban feels like it was outsourced to someone‚Äôs distracted cousin working from a coffee shop**. Totally disconnected from the real customer journey.

It‚Äôs wild how a brand this massive can drop the ball on something as basic as order accuracy.

It‚Äôs not just a missed pickup ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **trust breaker**. A silent loyalty killer.

I wouldn‚Äôt be this annoyed if it were a random DTC brand. But it‚Äôs *Ray-Ban*. In *New York City*. Come on.

If your store feels like luxury, but your e-com works like a sketchy beta version, the brand suffers. And frankly, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever bother with the site again.",2,1746041240.0,RayBanStories,3,0.67,False

From the title alone, I couldn't help but feel curious about what kind of trivia gems and fascinating facts I might uncover. I‚Äôve read this book on more than one occasion, and even had a few good laughs while discovering some genuinely interesting tidbits about science, history, sports, pop culture, and beyond. But it‚Äôs not without its quirks, so here‚Äôs my in-depth take on it.  

**Design That Fits Any Shelf (or Bathroom Counter)**  
The paperback format of this book makes it lightweight and portable (only 7.2 ounces!), perfect for someone like me who loves to sneak a few minutes of reading in wherever and whenever possible. Its dimensions‚Äî6 x 0.33 x 9 inches‚Äîmake it a comfortable fit in my hands, and if you‚Äôre keeping it by the sink or on a bookshelf, it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space. The bold, playful cover design caught my nephew‚Äôs attention, proving it adds a touch of humor to its functional build. The quality of the pages felt decent, even though they were thin enough to make me handle the book carefully to avoid accidental creases.  

**Positives**  
Here are a few standout aspects that left a lasting impression:  
- A broad array of trivia topics catering to diverse interests, from history to technology.  
- Concise chapters and short entries made it an effortless pick-up read for busy days.  
- Its humor and fun fact delivery kept me engaged without feeling like a textbook overload.  

**A Dash of Areas for Improvement**  
While I enjoyed the content immensely, there are a few minor quirks to note:  
- Some trivia entries felt oversimplified, leaving me wanting more in-depth explanations.  
- Its paperback binding could feel a touch flimsy for those prone to frequently flipping back and forth.  

**Usability for Trivia Lovers**  
What really impressed me about this book was how easy it was to engage with the content. As someone who craves bite-sized knowledge, the structure of short entries made it a fantastic coffee or bathroom break companion. Despite its lighthearted approach, I found myself returning to the same sections repeatedly because it‚Äôs one of those books you don‚Äôt simply read just once. My coworker, who borrowed it for their holiday weekend, mentioned how perfect it was as a gift idea for trivia buffs in their friend group.  

[Check Canyon Press 1957590424 price on Amazon.](https://usegadgets.com/p/1957590424/)  

**Competitive Options in the Trivia Book World**  
Let‚Äôs break down how it stands against other best-sellers in the trivia and pop culture niche. The *Bathroom Reader* series might have broader recognition, but this book‚Äôs specificity and humor give it a unique charm. Compared to *1,000 Facts That Will Blow Your Mind*, I found the Canyon Press title more approachable for casual readers who don‚Äôt want overly dense content. However, for readers seeking a deep-dive approach, those other titles might offer slightly more variety and heft.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering how much entertainment it packs into its modest 144 pages, this book delivers great bang for the buck. It serves its purpose brilliantly ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a grab-and-read for a quick laugh or an informal trivia session. Unlike pricier hardcover editions of similar books, it offers solid value without the hefty price tag that's typical in the genre. For trivia lovers or casual readers alike, it‚Äôs worth exploring this witty compilation.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/bIhpl9X)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

But a few days ago, something snapped ‚Äî and I decided I *had* to fix my brain.

# üö® The Problem: Micro-Attention Everything

I realized I couldn‚Äôt sit through a 10-minute YouTube video without:

* Skipping ahead
* Opening another tab
* Grabbing my phone halfway through for absolutely no reason

And don‚Äôt even get me started on reading. Articles? Skimmed. Books? Forgotten. Long tweets? Gone before the second sentence.

I wasn't just distracted ‚Äî I had turned my attention span into a bunch of 8-second TikToks glued together with coffee.

So I gave myself a short challenge:

>

Spoiler: I could. And I did.

# üîß What I Did ‚Äî And What Actually Helped

# 1. Set Timers, Not Goals

Instead of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to read 30 pages,‚Äù I said:

>

Why this works:  
Goals feel like chores. Timers feel like experiments. I used the **Pomodoro method** (25 minutes focus, 5 minute break) ‚Äî but even 10‚Äì15 minute chunks helped a *lot*.

# 2. Moved Social Media Off My Home Screen

I didn‚Äôt delete Instagram or TikTok.  
I just **hid them behind one extra swipe** and removed the notification badges.

That tiny friction made a huge difference.

# 3. Started My Day Without Input

For 3 mornings straight, I avoided my phone for the first 30 minutes.

Instead, I:

* Made coffee
* Stretched
* Wrote a quick list of what I actually needed to do

It sounds boring ‚Äî but I started the day with *clarity*, not chaos.

# 4. Re-trained with Low-Stakes Reading

I didn‚Äôt jump back into dense nonfiction. I needed something that wouldn‚Äôt fight me.

So I read:

* Short stories
* Graphic novels
* *And ‚Äî surprisingly helpful ‚Äî articles and blogs*

Yep. Not everything has to be a book.  
Sometimes the easiest way to rebuild attention is with something short, useful, and real-world relevant.

>

They‚Äôre low effort to start ‚Äî and often way more practical than 300 pages of fluff.

# üß† What Changed (in 4 Days)

After just a few days of these tweaks:

* I watched full videos without skipping
* I read two short books front-to-back
* I worked in 45-minute blocks without craving a dopamine snack
* I felt *sharper* ‚Äî less fog, more flow

And no, I didn‚Äôt become a productivity monk. I still scrolled. I still memed.  
But now I could **choose** when to do it ‚Äî instead of being pulled in every five seconds.

# üõ†Ô∏è Want to Try It? Start Here:

Here‚Äôs your ultra-simple blueprint:

1. Pick **1 task** you want to focus on (reading, working, studying)
2. Set a **15-minute timer**
3. Hide distractions (even just putting your phone in another room)
4. Start with **easy, interesting reading**:
   * Articles, blogs, newsletters
   * Topics you actually care about
5. Repeat once or twice a day for a few days

That‚Äôs it. No apps. No shame. No cold-turkey digital detox.  
Just a bit of space for your brain to stretch out again.

# üß≠ Final Thought

Your attention is your most valuable currency ‚Äî and the modern world is basically built to steal it.

But with a few tweaks and a little awareness, you can **take it back**.  
Not completely. Not perfectly. But enough to feel human again.

A year ago I was diagnosed with IgA (IgA nephropathy), and after a long treatment with prednisone, my kidney function is now at 94%, which is really great. I thought the hardest part was behind me, but it turns out IgA has caused chronic inflammation in my mucous membranes.

She‚Äôs four, sweet, bright, full of questions. The kind of kid who waves at birds and talks to ants. So when she started sitting cross-legged in front of her bedroom wall, whispering and giggling, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Kids have imaginary friends. It's healthy, right?

She called him *Mr. Pebbles*.

I laughed at the name. But the laughter stopped when the rocks appeared.

At first, just one, perfectly round and smooth, like it had been polished by centuries of river current. It was in her bedsheets. Then another in her shoe. One in her cereal bowl. I kept finding them, and every one was cold. Not room-temperature cold. Cold like they‚Äôd just come up from deep underground.

I asked her where they came from.

‚ÄúHe gives them to me when I listen and be good,‚Äù she said with a sleepy smile.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the rings.

Chalky white circles had started appearing on her bedroom wall, uneven and strange, like they‚Äôd been drawn by a shaky hand. Some were the size of coffee mugs, others wide enough to crawl through. I asked about the circles, ready to scold her for writing on the wall. She called them ‚Äúhis windows.‚Äù Said Mr. Pebbles used them to look at us.

‚ÄúHe wants to see if the air‚Äôs soft enough yet,‚Äù she added.

I didn‚Äôt know what that meant.

She stopped sleeping through the night. I‚Äôd find her sitting bolt upright in bed, her face inches from the wall, sleepily mumbling lullabies in a voice that didn‚Äôt sound like her own. And sometimes, *God help me*, I swear I heard something whisper back. A low, wet sound like gravel rolling in a throat.

I pressed my hand against the wall. It was cold. Thrumming, subtly, like something was breathing beneath the plaster and wallpaper. I knocked.

Something knocked back.

After that, I made Ellie start sleeping in our room. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go back in there, much less let my daughter sleep in that room at night.

Last night, she told me Mr. Pebbles was coming to visit soon. That he had given her a special task. He wanted her to ‚Äúpull the circles open.‚Äù

That was it. I was done. ‚ÄúNo more Mr. Pebbles,‚Äù I commanded. You'd have thought I kicked the family dog. She screamed and cried so hard she shook. 

‚ÄúNo one tells Mr. Pebbles, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù,‚Äù she sobbed. There was anger in her little eyes when she said that, but also something else, fear, I think. 

She‚Äôs sleeping now, finally. Clutching one of those stones to her chest like it‚Äôs her favorite stuffed animal. Her lips are moving, tiny whispers I can‚Äôt make out.

But the wall in her room is cracking.

Hairline fractures spidering out from the largest circle. The wallpaper is bubbling. The plaster is breathing.

Hi, I‚Äôm Dr. Arzate, and today I want to introduce you to a treatment that can completely transform your smile: porcelain veneers. These are thin, custom-made shells crafted from high-quality ceramic materials, bonded to the front surface of your teeth to dramatically enhance your dental aesthetics while maintaining a natural, vibrant appearance.



Why Choose Porcelain Veneers?



‚úÖ Superior Aesthetics
Porcelain veneers mimic the light-reflecting properties of natural enamel, delivering an authentic, stunning smile.

‚úÖ Durability and Stain Resistance
Made from high-grade ceramic, porcelain veneers are extremely durable and resistant to staining, lasting 10 to 15 years or more with proper care.

‚úÖ Solutions for Common Dental Concerns
They are ideal for correcting discolored, worn, chipped, misaligned teeth, or closing irregular gaps.

‚úÖ Minimally Invasive Procedure
Only a small amount of enamel is removed, making this a much less invasive option compared to other dental procedures.



The Step-by-Step Process



1. Initial Consultation & Smile Design
   We evaluate your dental health and discuss your aesthetic goals. Using advanced technology, we design a fully customized smile tailored to your facial features.
2. Tooth Preparation
   A thin layer of enamel is removed to create space for the veneers. Impressions are taken to ensure perfect customization. Temporary veneers are placed to protect your smile during fabrication.
3. Laboratory Precision
   Your veneers are crafted in a dental lab using digital scanning for perfect shape, size, and color matching.
4. Final Placement
   A few days later, the definitive porcelain veneers are bonded individually with high-strength dental adhesives, ensuring precise fit and flawless aesthetics.
5. Final Results
   The transformation is immediate‚Äîa radiant, natural-looking smile that enhances your overall appearance and boosts your confidence.




Key Advantages of Porcelain Veneers



‚úîÔ∏è Color Stability: They resist staining from coffee, tea, and tobacco.
‚úîÔ∏è Biocompatibility: Highly compatible with gum tissue, reducing risk of irritation.
‚úîÔ∏è Customization: Every veneer is meticulously crafted for a seamless, natural result.



How Porcelain Veneers Transform Your Life



‚ú® Aesthetic Enhancement: Achieve a whiter, more uniform smile that complements your facial beauty.
‚ú® Increased Confidence: Feel more secure in social and professional interactions.
‚ú® Personalized Solutions: Tailored to correct your specific aesthetic concerns.
‚ú® Better Oral Health: Aligning and strengthening teeth can facilitate better hygiene and reduce the risk of dental diseases.
‚ú® Youthful, Attractive Appearance: A rejuvenated smile can make you look younger and feel revitalized.

1kbokvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuickWire/comments/1kbokvn/the_ultimate_guide_to_waking_up_early_without/,üåÖ The Ultimate Guide to Waking Up Early (Without Feeling Like Trash),"Let‚Äôs get real: you‚Äôve tried waking up early.

You set your alarm for 6:00 AM. You hit snooze. You hate yourself.  
Maybe you power through one ‚Äúmiracle morning‚Äù before crashing by Thursday.

But what if *waking up early* didn‚Äôt have to suck?

This isn‚Äôt about becoming a 5AM motivational monk.  
It‚Äôs about **reclaiming your mornings**, having quiet hours to think, and actually feeling human before 10AM.

This guide will walk you through how to do it ‚Äî without burning out or becoming a coffee-fueled zombie.

# ‚è∞ Step 1: Understand Why You Struggle

Waking up early isn‚Äôt just about going to bed earlier.  
It‚Äôs about fixing a system that‚Äôs designed to make you fail.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs sabotaging you:

* **Screens frying your melatonin at night**
* **Caffeine too late in the day**
* **Inconsistent sleep schedules**
* **Trying to overhaul everything at once**

And maybe... *you're just going to bed anxious and overstimulated every night.*

Let‚Äôs fix that.

# üåô Step 2: Master the Night First

The war for your morning is won the night before.

# üåí 1. The 90-Minute Rule

Your body sleeps in 90-minute cycles. Aim to **wake up at the end** of a cycle ‚Äî not in the middle of REM.

Use a calculator like [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/) to time your bedtime based on when you want to wake up.

# üî• 2. Shut It Down

* No screens 60 minutes before bed
* No caffeine 6+ hours before bed
* Dim the lights ‚Äî use orange/amber lighting or night mode
* Take a hot shower before bed ‚Äî then cool down in a cold room

# üõèÔ∏è 3. Wind-Down Routine

Repeat the same 3 steps every night. Example:

1. Stretch
2. Journal 5 minutes
3. Read (fiction > non-fiction)

This trains your brain: *‚Äúwe‚Äôre powering down now.‚Äù*

# ‚òÄÔ∏è Step 3: Wake Up With Less Pain

# üö® No Snooze

Snoozing destroys sleep quality. You start a new cycle ‚Äî then interrupt it.  
Solution? Put your phone across the room.

# üí° Get Light ‚Äî Fast

Open curtains. Step outside. Use a daylight lamp if needed.  
Light tells your brain *‚Äúit‚Äôs time to be awake.‚Äù*

# üèÉ Move Early

No need to run 10K. Just 5 minutes of movement:

* Pushups
* Stretching
* Quick walk outside Triggers your cortisol system to fully ‚Äúboot up.‚Äù

# üßä Bonus Trick: Cold Exposure

Even a splash of cold water on your face can wake up your nervous system and kill morning fog.

# üìÜ Step 4: Lock In Your Routine

Consistency > intensity.

Pick a time and **wake up at that time 7 days a week** (yes, even weekends ‚Äî sorry).

After 10‚Äì14 days, your body will adapt. You‚Äôll start waking up naturally.  
You‚Äôll feel weird sleeping in. That‚Äôs when it clicks.

# üß† Step 5: Use Your Mornings With Purpose

This is the whole point: extra hours = space to *actually live.*

Don‚Äôt waste it doomscrolling. Use it for:

* Writing
* Reading
* Creating
* Learning
* Planning your day
* Quiet, uninterrupted flow time

Even 30 quiet minutes in the morning beats 3 distracted hours at night.

# üß≠ TL;DR ‚Äî Your Early Wake-Up Blueprint

* üåô Fix your nights ‚Üí same bedtime, screens off early
* ‚è∞ Wake up at the *same time* daily (yes, weekends)
* üö´ No snooze button ‚Äî get out of bed immediately
* ‚òÄÔ∏è Get light, move your body, drink water
* üìö Use your morning with intention, not reaction

You don‚Äôt have to be a morning person.

You just have to **build a system** that doesn‚Äôt fight your biology ‚Äî and then protect it like it matters.

Im guessing Indian 3 should be approx 3hrs 30 min long.  
I'm a 17-year-old huge movie fan üáÆüá≥, and after seeing the wa*y Indian*¬†2 (sadly) underperformed, I had this CRAZY IDEA that honestly coul**d revi**ve the whol*e Indi*an franchise into¬†**a global banger**¬†üåç**üî•. Guys some topics are controversial here but please complete reading all of it. Plea**se üò¢

Here‚Äôs the full plot I imagined for¬†**Indian 3**,

**Controversies you may not like (please don't judge)**

**1) Yes there are female villains who will be killed, its 2025, it's ""gender equality""**

**2)The story takes place in foreign land so outside people can be attracted to it**

**3) This has to be a bridge and connect older Indian 1 lovers to gen z and is like compensation for Indian 2's flop. Hence highlights misandry (false rape cases) recent worldwide surge of racism to Indians (especially Indian men). But whole story is not just that, it has action and etc. Foreign locations include London and New York.**

**4) It is not completely new but it is connected to the Indian 3 trailer but with a new twist. The universal thing is Senapathy performs marmakala on specific set of people.**

**5) I phrased it in English, Im an NRI, telugu person so I have no idea of tamil Im sorry but Im a fan of the Indian(Bharateeyudu) series.**

**6) And finally, we are living in 2025, nowadays people want drama, excitement, controversy, not killing some old rich tamil businessmen called ""evil"". We need to highlight struglles of indian hindu men, and make it appealing to the global audience.**

**Who are the villains?(actors/actress I imagined for the villains)**

**Isabella (A hot hollywood actress who is extremely racist towards indian men and ruins a tamil boy's life) -Sabrina Carpenter**

**Reggie (Roadmen from the streets of London, who kills an NRI student admitted to Oxford University from India) - Jamie Foxx (He is originally not supposed to be killed but he taunts Senapathy and kills an indian boy in front of him)**

**Viktor(Drug Syndicate Leader in UK but causes huge unrest to Indian politicians and hence financial loss for India (you guys please continue on this) - Jason Momoa**

**Lara(British Hacker who hacks Indian banks and works for SJ Suryah, she knows Marmakala too, and is a tough opponent, she hacks Indian banks and benefits SJ Suryah) - Hayley Atwell**

**SJ Suryah(Final Villain) - Knows marmakala**

**From start to end, I will explain it, please make it viral. Im praying to Lord Hanuman and Lord Krishna for their blessings. And also please rate it. (By the way, this is just to highlight modern problems, racism and all. If any modern slang like ""pajeet"" offends you, I truly apologize but I had to add it in for the movie.**

**First villain Murder**

So the movie starts of in Ibiza, there is a sexy item song with Isabella, (sunny afternoon in beaches, microbikini girls twerking kissing, etc, lollipop sucked by Isabella, etc, yatch dance, and night dance in club, think of Kissik but better with alcohol), then after the dance she has an indian assistant (a dark skinned tamil man), she slaps him hard because when he said her trailer is ready, its not echo proof meaning people can still hear outside what is happening. So by the time she reaches India, (keep in mind she is only going to India for a bollywood thing not to live there) she says to her assisant ""God I can't wait to get out of that shithole after my signature"".

So anyways she is in her private jet when her agent says ""Mam, this Senapathy guy is still alive, and he... has a reputation for killing those he deems ""unworthy"". A slight shock appears on Isabella's face and coincidentally a turbulence happens in the private jet. The camera zooms out quickly into the blue sky and in cloudy letters. It is phrased ""INDIAN 3 (WAR MODE)"" as sunlight is shining on the letters, with insane Souraa + Come Back Indian BGM. And then zooms back into the private jet and then she mocks him saying ""What have I did wrong? Im just telling the truth about Indians especially their men, they are just ""ugly shitskin pajeets"" and laughs. She lands in India, then as usual racist, next taxi driver with car scene, boring bits but yea, she arrives in her trailer does makeup etc. But now a boy(13M) called¬†**Subarao**¬†who is bullied for being a huge fan of her, is introduced. He is dark skinned etc, and poor, he is bullied saying ""Isabella will never even lift her eye for you"" etc, but anyways as guards are stopping the crowd he runs for her and offers her a gift and sweets. She gets insanely mad slaps him but frames it as he is trying to ""sexually abuse her"", news is leaked and he is bullied even more in school, and so on, but Senapathy spots him as he is trying to commit sucide and stops him, saying he ""knew he didn't do anything wrong"" (contrasts to killing his son in Indian 1), as Isabella enters her trailer again, and locks the door and throws it, Senapathy catches it, and looking at a bikini picture of her says ""You look hot here, but I doubt if this is any hot compared to the hell you will go to"", she screams and shouts but she remembers she slapped another tamil man in Ibiza for an ""echo proof caravan"" to be arranged. She tries to seduce him which fails and says ""You won't kill a woman would you? Isn't it against your code?"" He replies ""You asked for gender equality, justice sees no gender"" and performs Marmakala on her, as her face falls on dog shit, it highlights the contrast and he says ""Shit... skin"" and the insane bgm starts. Then in LA her death causes a huge struggle. Anyways then Senapathy goes to London to kill Viktor (Jason Momoa), while LA police, hollywood and indian police, don't suspect Senapathy for Isabella's death. Because they think ""Why would Senapathy kill a woman? And that too she didn't do anything harmful to the nation"". The authorities swear, they will ""catch the killer and make him pay""

**Second villain Murder**

Now Senapathy goes to London to kill Viktor originally, but the plan changes. It is rainy as usual, and basically as he walks, Senapathy is still wanted, but this is only in India, but still Senapathy has a disguise. Senapathy sees an Indian hindu student (Arjun), he got into Oxford University, but is stabbed and killed by Reggie. He is a roadman (please search it up for those who don't know). Senapathy learns that since the laws are so gender biased towards men in India and especially for hindus, Arjun works so hard to get into Oxford university, but is stabbed, so anyways there are some funny scenes in London, as Senapathy is in disguise, as in the coffee shop when he wants chai etc. Just to keep the audience in attention. But he remembers Reggie as the guy who shouts ""Bruv, you old bastard, who tf do you think you are mate"" (in a british accent) but at the London Bridge at night there is a fight with Reggie, his roadmen gang and Senapathy. Basically there is a funny contrast to London Roadmen and Rayalseema rowdies (since we can assume Senapathy is from there) but basically Senapathy says ""You dress in jackets and carry knives like cowards, but us Rayalseema people have the blood of warriors"", etc, so in London Bridge at night, an iconic fight scene happens, Reggie and his roadmen come all at him, but this time, the ""rowdies"" aren't Indian, they are white and black from London. And the insane BGM music reappears and basically it is a link to Indian 2, since he kills the 2nd golden villain on the bridge and british colonization since its set in London. But basically Senapathy does insane marmakala on Reggie's roadmen, and since the recording has gone viral, the Indian authorities know that he is in London, and as an iconic movie scene, as Reggie pulls up his gun to shoot Senapathy, Senapathy jumps on him and does marmakala on his neck, but Senapathy smartly kills all the guys and pushes them into the water so authorities cannot track finger prints, and as the british police say ""Put your hands up!"" Senapathy jumps into the water. And also it is known that Viktor escaped to New York. But both Lara and Viktor (big villains) are killed in New york, so 2 birds with one shot.

But now Bobby Simha comes again and is working with the british police to track him, since the indian series decipts police as not being able to catch him. But yes, then a huge surprise happens. Its new york and snowing and christmas, but who is Senapathy?? He is dressed as Santa Claus. üòÇ

**Third + Fouth villain Murder**

Anyways, its snowing in New york, and christmas festive vibes, and Senapathy is wearing a red Santa outfit (keep this in mind, it camouflages the blood) giving candy to kids and people whatever, but here an intense chase happens as Senapathy finds Viktor in his base, but a huge fight scene again happens. Viktor's men in vans try and shoot him as he is chasing Viktor, (Jason Momoa), think of the final chase of Indian 2. But anyways as Senapathy kills Viktor's goons, Viktor escapes to the nyc subway, and pulls a gun on the people to escape, and as they all run away, Viktor starts the tube (train), but still he is smart enough to keep some goons on his side, with guns, and Senapathy runs into the train before it closes. But Senapathy does insane marmakala here, we see all the fighting actions and things. But we have to know Viktor is a big eye, just like Lara and SJ suryah, even if he doesn't know Marmakala, he beats Senapathy up (I used inspiration from Rajamouli, since he makes villains strong not weak) but an intense scene is where Viktor tries to give a huge punch to Senapathy but still Senapathy performs marmakala on him before Viktor can touch him, but he gives an intense kill to Viktor and pushes Viktor of while the tube is moving and out of the glass. There is intense BGM music etc, because we have to make it more insane and more action scenes as Jason Momoa falls of the tube and breaks the glass. But the mystery is when the next station is coming, he isn't in the tube as the american police are searching for him and the foreign crowd cheers for him.

Now, before Senapathy goes to Lara, (since she is a badass hacker/fighter and can do Marmakala as well), she genuinely beats up Senapathy and weakens him, her men kidnap Senapathy and truly torture him, (Guys I know the next scene may look extremely cringe as a white woman tries to intimidate Senapathy but this just acknowledges her charcter) she says ""Oh hello Santa, or should I say Senapathyyyy? (SJ Suryah's charcter) set me up to kill you before the police sees you. Once the money in the Indian banks are gone, it will be just like the¬†**british empire**¬†left it"". The word¬†**british**¬†reminds Senapathy of his father's struggles, now it takes us to the flasback provided in the Indian 2 trailer of Senapathy's dad fighting against the british empire, but this is like 45 minutes, since it has to be continued from Indian 2. But then after the dream Senapathy wakes up, as we believe he is indeed trying to be killed, but SJ Suryah orders her to kill him sadistically. But anyways Senapathy gets up, becomes even more stronger since the dream and there is again an insane intense fight scene between Lara and her men, but Lara is stronger than Reggie and Viktor combined she knows marmakala and hugely damages Senapathy but still he wins against her and before the American police can catch him.

**Fifth and final villain murder (SJ Suryah)**

And finally Senapathy returns to Chennai, and almost everybody is ready for him, but then again this time a bigger chase happens with intense action scenes, and a huge fight happens between SJ suryah and Senapathy, and SJ suryah is about to win, but as he falls, Senapathy influences the crowd, brings national awareness in them and makes them fight SJ Suryah, and at the end kills SJ suryah, and gives a lecture to everybody, but this time everybody cheers for him and kneels for Senapathy and realize their mistakes and strive to create a better India, even the british and american police force kneel for him and Senapathy becomes a world wide icon and explains the mistakes of these 5 people and appeals to everybody.

# My Gut Was a Mess ‚Äì And So Was My Life

  


For years, I struggled with gut issues. I‚Äôm talking about constant bloating, random stomach cramps, gas, embarrassing bathroom issues, and a stubborn weight that refused to go away no matter how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù I tried to eat.

  


Every morning, I would wake up with a heavy stomach. By 2 PM, I needed a nap. My skin was dull, my energy was at rock bottom, and my mental clarity? Non-existent.

  


I tried probiotics from the drugstore. I tried fiber powders. I even tried eliminating foods like dairy, gluten, and sugar. But nothing worked ‚Äì at least not consistently. And worst of all, I started to believe that this was just ‚Äúhow my body is now.‚Äù



# That‚Äôs when I discovered¬†PrimeBiome.

  


# What Is PrimeBiome?



PrimeBiome is a¬†**premium gut-health formula**¬†that goes beyond just being a probiotic. It‚Äôs loaded with¬†**high-quality, clinically proven strains of probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes**, and more.

But what makes it truly stand out is this:

>

And the best part? It does all this¬†*naturally*.

  


# Week-by-Week Experience Using PrimeBiome

  


Let me break it down so you know exactly what to expect:

  


# ‚úÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Immediate Relief

  


Within just 3 days, I noticed that my bloating had drastically reduced. I could eat my favorite foods again without doubling over in discomfort. I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom, and for the first time in years, I felt‚Ä¶¬†*normal*.

It‚Äôs hard to explain how powerful that is unless you‚Äôve lived with daily gut issues. It felt like my body was finally cooperating with me.

  


# ‚úÖ Week 2 ‚Äì More Energy, Better Sleep

  


By the second week, my energy was on another level. I didn‚Äôt need coffee to keep my eyes open. I was getting through work with full focus and actually sleeping deeply at night.

Oh, and something I didn‚Äôt expect?¬†**My skin started clearing up.**¬†I wasn‚Äôt even using any new skincare products ‚Äì it was all internal healing from PrimeBiome.

  


# ‚úÖ Week 3 ‚Äì Slimmer Waistline, Less Cravings

  


This week was when I really started to¬†*feel*¬†and¬†*see*¬†the weight loss benefits. I wasn‚Äôt bloated, my pants were looser, and I noticed I had way fewer cravings for sugar and carbs.

I later found out this was due to the¬†**balanced gut bacteria PrimeBiome supports**, which helps regulate appetite and hunger hormones.

  


# ‚úÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Total Body Transformation

  


By the end of the month, I felt like a brand new person. I had dropped 6 pounds without changing my diet. My digestion was flawless. I wasn‚Äôt bloated at all. My mind was sharper. I was even in a better mood.

And get this ‚Äì people started noticing. Friends asked me if I had started working out (I hadn‚Äôt!). One coworker said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing lately, what are you doing differently?‚Äù



The answer:¬†**PrimeBiome**.

  


# What‚Äôs Inside PrimeBiome That Makes It So Effective?

  


Let‚Äôs quickly look at what makes this formula so powerful:

* **11 Proven Strains of Probiotics**¬†(including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) ‚Äì for restoring good gut bacteria
* **Prebiotic Fiber**¬†‚Äì to feed and support those healthy bacteria
* **Digestive Enzymes**¬†‚Äì for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients better
* **Zinc, Magnesium & Turmeric**¬†‚Äì to reduce gut inflammation and improve immunity

It‚Äôs non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. That‚Äôs quality you can trust.



# Why PrimeBiome Is Better Than Any Other Probiotic I‚Äôve Tried

  


I‚Äôve tried 7 different gut health supplements before. Most of them gave me either:

* Zero results
* Temporary relief
* Or worse ‚Äì more bloating

PrimeBiome was different from the start. Why?

1. **It doesn‚Äôt just give you probiotics ‚Äì it gives you the**¬†***whole system***¬†(enzymes + prebiotics + gut-healing minerals)
2. **It‚Äôs shelf-stable**¬†‚Äì no refrigeration needed
3. **It‚Äôs backed by real clinical science**
4. **It actually WORKS**¬†‚Äì and works fast

# Who Should Try PrimeBiome?

  


Honestly? If you‚Äôve experienced¬†*any*¬†of the following, PrimeBiome is worth trying ASAP:

* Bloating or gas after meals
* Food intolerances or random stomach pain
* Low energy or constant fatigue
* Mood swings or brain fog
* Difficulty losing weight or stubborn belly fat
* Skin problems like acne or dullness
* Poor sleep or low immunity

Because these are all linked to¬†**an unbalanced gut**¬†‚Äì and PrimeBiome helps restore it naturally.

  


# Final Verdict: This Is More Than a Supplement ‚Äì It‚Äôs a Life Upgrade

  


If you‚Äôre tired of feeling off, bloated, or just not like yourself ‚Äì¬†**PrimeBiome might just be the one thing that transforms your health from the inside out**.

It did for me. I wake up energized. I digest better. I feel lighter. My mind is clearer. And I honestly feel 10 years younger.

I wish I had started using this sooner.

But what makes it stand out?



# It‚Äôs not just another probiotic.



PrimeBiome contains a unique blend of¬†**clinically researched strains**, including¬†**Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis**, and others that are scientifically proven to survive stomach acid and reach your gut intact‚Äî*where they actually work*.

  


It also includes a¬†**prebiotic fiber blend**, which feeds the good bacteria and helps them multiply.

When your gut is healthy, everything starts to work better‚Äîdigestion, metabolism, skin, mood, even brain function.



# Why I Decided to Try PrimeBiome (After Wasting Money on So Many Others)

  


Before PrimeBiome, I‚Äôd tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion¬†*worse*. Most didn‚Äôt even survive stomach acid.

  


I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months‚Äîand that convinced me to give it a try.



I ordered the¬†**3-bottle pack**¬†(better value), thinking I‚Äôd try it for 90 days.



I had no idea what was coming.



# Week 1: Subtle Shifts I Almost Missed

  


Within the first week, I noticed something small but important‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt feeling as¬†*bloated*¬†after meals. Normally, after lunch or dinner, I‚Äôd feel heavy, uncomfortable, and gassy. But after just 5 days, I felt¬†*lighter*.

My cravings also started to shift. I wasn‚Äôt reaching for sugary snacks like usual. Was it a coincidence? I didn‚Äôt think much of it yet.



# Week 2: Better Sleep & More Energy

  


By week two, something clicked. I was waking up before my alarm,¬†*feeling refreshed*. That hasn‚Äôt happened in¬†*years*. My energy during the day felt more stable. I wasn‚Äôt crashing after lunch, and I didn‚Äôt need my usual afternoon coffee.

  


I started getting excited. If this is what two weeks looked like, I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what a month would bring.

  


# Month 1: My Body Felt ‚ÄúReset‚Äù



After a full 30 days on PrimeBiome, I felt like a completely different person.

* My¬†**digestion was smooth**‚Äîno more bloating or stomach cramps.
* I was going to the bathroom¬†*regularly*¬†(TMI, but if you know, you know).
* My¬†**skin cleared up**‚Äîthose random breakouts disappeared.
* My¬†**mood was better**. I wasn‚Äôt snapping at people or feeling foggy. I felt¬†*present*.
* And here‚Äôs the kicker: I lost¬†**7 pounds**‚Äîwithout changing my diet.

I later found out that poor gut health can cause¬†*inflammation*, which leads to water retention and weight gain. Once the inflammation went down, my body finally released the excess.



# Months 2-3: Long-Term Benefits Start Showing

  


By month two, the changes became even more noticeable.



Friends and coworkers were asking me what I was doing differently. My¬†**skin was glowing**, my energy was high, and my mind was¬†*clear*‚Äîlike I had mental clarity for the first time in years.

  


Even my¬†**immune system**¬†seemed to improve. Normally, I‚Äôd catch a cold at least once a month. But for three straight months? Nothing. Not even a sniffle.

  


I also noticed my¬†**anxiety levels dropped**. It turns out, your gut produces up to 90% of your serotonin‚Äîthe feel-good hormone. By fixing my gut, I was fixing my mind too.

  


# The PrimeBiome Difference (Why It Actually Works)

  


Here‚Äôs why I believe PrimeBiome works when others fail:



‚úÖ¬†**10 Billion CFUs**¬†from clinically proven strains  
‚úÖ¬†**Survives stomach acid**¬†to actually reach your gut  
‚úÖ¬†**Includes prebiotics**, which most brands ignore  
‚úÖ¬†**Non-GMO, no fillers, no garbage ingredients**  
‚úÖ¬†**Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility**  
‚úÖ¬†**Real results backed by thousands of happy customers**



It‚Äôs not just another trendy supplement. It‚Äôs¬†*science-backed and results-driven*.



# The Only Downside‚Ä¶

  


The only ‚Äúcon‚Äù I‚Äôve found?

It sells out¬†*fast*.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks‚Äîand during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That‚Äôs when I realized this isn‚Äôt just a short-term boost. It‚Äôs something your body¬†*wants and needs consistently*.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it‚Äîand they‚Äôre hooked too.



# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

  


**YES. 1000 times yes.**



If you‚Äôre struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won‚Äôt budge‚Äîyour gut could be the root cause.

  


I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just any supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a total body reset from the inside out.



I only wish I had started sooner.



# My Advice: Don‚Äôt Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself



If you‚Äôre on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me‚Äî**you have nothing to lose and everything to gain**.



Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.



I can almost guarantee you‚Äôll feel the difference‚Äîand once you do, you‚Äôll never want to go back.

For years, I struggled with digestive issues‚Äîconstant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn‚Äôt just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.



My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn‚Äôt until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That‚Äôs when I discovered PrimeBiome.



# First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?

# 

PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.



What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It‚Äôs not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.



# Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion.



I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn‚Äôt experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn‚Äôt feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.



The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn‚Äôt experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn‚Äôt dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.



# Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity



By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn‚Äôt needing my usual caffeine fix.



On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It‚Äôs incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.



One thing I‚Äôve learned is that gut health doesn‚Äôt just impact digestion‚Äîit has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.



# Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone



By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.



What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.



I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn‚Äôt just addressing one symptom‚Äîit was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.



# Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It



So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It‚Äôs all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:



Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.



Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.



Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.

Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.



# No More Guesswork‚ÄîPrimeBiome Does the Work for You



What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases‚Äîprobiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.



Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body‚Äôs natural processes.

  


# The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome



If you‚Äôve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It‚Äôs not a quick fix‚Äîit‚Äôs a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.



I‚Äôve tried countless other products over the years, but none have come close to the results I‚Äôve seen with PrimeBiome. If you‚Äôre looking for something that actually works, with scientifically-backed ingredients and long-lasting results, this is the product for you.

1kbohyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1kbohyi/i_think_im_genuinely_starting_to_hate_this_field/,I think I‚Äôm genuinely starting to hate this field,"I (32/m) have worked in finance for around 6+ years. I‚Äôve had two roles both of which I was laid off from due to budgetary reasons. During my time I got for FINRA licenses (7,3,63,34), I built a python portfolio, and from the most recent job, I was laid off from (mind you after having only worked there FOR A MONTH) I was on a trade desk for a boutique asset manager as a trading associate. I graduated late at the age of 25 because I had a plethora of personal and family issues as well as putting myself through school. On top of that, the state school I went to wasn‚Äôt even ranked. Let‚Äôs just say it was a super non-target university. I consider myself a fairly intelligent guy. I‚Äôm neurodivergent, severe ADHD. I‚Äôm not a genius but I speak three languages and when I got testing done for ADHD I scored 118 IQ. The kicker is I was scoring 120+ when I initially had testing done when I was around nine years old. I get that it doesn‚Äôt mean shit but my point is I‚Äôm able to learn the material that‚Äôs presented to me. Only caveat is I have to be medicated and constantly workout just to be able to function as a normal human.

I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I‚Äôm burned out. I never truly got a shot at working those high Finance jobs that everyone‚Äôs after. You could say I‚Äôm burned out with the grind of trying to break in. With networking career coaches and a whole bunch of fucking elbow grease and will I was unable to get a job that was even worth a damn. I‚Äôm fucking burned out from trying to break in. From my soulless back office job, to the job I was just laid off from as a trading associate I never truly was given a shot no matter how much effort and ‚Äúright moves‚Äù I made. Now the older I get the more I learn it‚Äôs not in my favor. I‚Äôm unmarried. I don‚Äôt have any fucking kids and yet I‚Äôm still looked at as an old man in recruiting when I‚Äôm nowhere near old. The only reason why I haven‚Äôt gone crazy yet (or shit maybe I have) it‚Äôs just from watching my immigrant parents and seeing how hard they had to work just to provide for the life that they gave me. Which on top of that having a foreign name in a southern state, doesn‚Äôt really bode well for hiring. Don‚Äôt take my word for it literally go look up studies explaining it. Here‚Äôs a link, https://oreopoulos.faculty.economics.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/How-An-Ethnic-sounding-Name-May-Affect-The-Job-Hunt.pdf. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the typical ‚Äúfinance bro‚Äù, not including all the Nepo hires (that‚Äôs another whole sack of dog shit I don‚Äôt want to go through). My director would tell me stories about how his hedge fund manager used to throw cups of coffee at his head and break keyboard at his desk. He said that‚Äôs a normal thing and that‚Äôs just how it is. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs a soulless asshole that only cares about money and gambles with not only the careers of his hires, but in essence, the money that client‚Äôs give to him. I get it, there‚Äôs a lot on the line for a lot of these jobs, but Jesus fucking Christ have a backbone. I feel like a fucking loser. I feel like I‚Äôm a goddamn failure and I shouldn‚Äôt. This industry just brings the worst out in people and it‚Äôs a massive elephant in the fucking room that nobody seems to wanna point out. 

I know I‚Äôm getting on my soapbox and ranting. I probably sound like the biggest complainer right now. I can‚Äôt take it anymore, I‚Äôm just so fucking tired. All the bullshit I‚Äôve seen for the past seven years in this field. My girlfriend is an engineer when I tell her about things that happened during work she‚Äôs blown away by how toxic and shitty it is. Now I gotta get back on the grind to find another job so I don‚Äôt literally end up fucking homeless. Best bet I go back to school studying my fucking ass off just to gamble with my career and maybe get a job that pays well. Eight years of grinding and barely anything to show for it. Have to go back send out resumes put on a fake smile on my face and pretend as if this field isn‚Äôt a load of dog shit.

**Program Overview**

Juggernaut 2.0 is designed to be for developing all round athleticism. It's not a powerlifting program and the focus is on sub maximal training because the only irreplaceable part of a sports training is the sport itself. There's only one set in the 16 week program for each lift at 90%.

The lifts are run in 4 week cycles focusing on 10 reps, 8 reps, 5 reps and 3 reps with a deload every 4th week.

I did the ""What I Do"" for the accessories (Pullups, Dips, Ab Wheel, Good Mornings, Hamstrings, Lunges, Squats) and used simplified conditioning (30s '@ 70% Watts rowing, 8 press ups, 10 sit ups, 15s Rest)

Some people have called the program High Volume, but given 1/4 s deloads, 1/4 is building to a single AMRAP set; it's only the Initialisation weeks that is high volume and then only really for the first few waves.

**My Background**

I'd previously been running a powerbuilding program that I added cardio and Judo to. This meant i was doing 6 weight sessions a week 40 minutes-1 hour, Five cardio session of 30 minutes and often a 1-2 hour cardio session at the weekend. And with getting changed, grabbing a coffee and prep this was taking 16 hours a week. I've got a young son so that sort of routine was no longer viable.

Judo is my primary sport so Strength and Conditioning isn't going to be my priority, i also have two young children, so I needed something which would be flexible.

**What I liked**

Doing abs first as a warm up meant i was no longer skipping them, as long as i don't half ass the workout I'm able to finish in an hour, including taking 5 minutes at the end to stretch.

Adding sprinting in really helped with things like playing 5 a side football on a stag do and general athleticism.

I've not tested my jumps really, but doing weighted jumps hopefully will lead to being about to dunk a basketball, not really a major objective.

The plate halos uncovered a weakness in my neck/ upper back that I resolved by doing really light weights nice and slowly.

Emphasis on pullups and dips kept my general athleticism for Murph and the 300 workout without needing specific prep (I do these with family once a year) my times didn‚Äôt improve drastically but i also didn‚Äôt change my focus for a month beforehand to prep. Also meant I kept more of an eye on my weight than I otherwise may have.

Four days a week gives a lot of flexibility for when life gets in the way, even if you have to go away with work for a couple of days you can move the workouts around.

Deload weeks mean you're not building up too much soreness and they always seemed to come on a busy week where i could do with being in the gym for less time, which was lucky.

Sub maximal training meant i wasn't destroying myself before a Judo session, and especially on the deload weeks i could perform really highly in training (sport training has too many variables based on lesson plan, who shows up to plan intensity so having a lot left in the tank is useful)

**What I didn't like**

I took a long time for Peaking and my Cardio has dropped a little. The numbers speak for themselves and other than the Squat i didn't see large improvements, especially as i had time off from Judo (due to convenient bank holidays) and hadn't done much except the core lifts. I was especially disappointed as I could have joined the 1000lbs club if I'd hit my e1rm in the three main lifts.

**Conclusion**

I think I've been pushing my weights up too much rather than prioritising the reps, (rounding the 95% of estimated 1rm too much towards the heavier side) Part of this was so that i could rep out in my 3s wave a heavier weight than my previous 1rm but i think one of the strengths of this program is looking at rep maxs and on my 3s wave i should have been doing more reps at a slightly lighter weight.

After having been lifting for a while I'm finally prioritising recovering, and doing a program as designed and written rather than a DIY one. Next I'll probably learn that I need to put on bodyweight to improve my lifts!

**Whats next**

There's a section in the book about adding Weightlifting (Olympic Lifting) and given I've got a British Weightlifting associated Gym nearby I'm going to try out once a week.

I've also not done the recommended Upper Body Jumps or Throws in the program, some of this I get in an unstructured way from Judo but buying a medicine ball and doing it properly might be useful.

I'm going to look at doing the lifts beltless as I‚Äôm keen to have less reliance on equipment and doing the lifts beltless appeals to me more than shooting for a higher total.

**Tl;Dr:** Started spending less time in the gym and fewer sets; much stronger and better all round improvements.",1,1746039705.0,fitness30plus,1,0.67,False

Just got the MRI back and was diagnosed with a 6.3mm cystic microprolactinoma with hyperprolactinemia levels of 91.83.  While I'm waiting for the referrals to clear for an endocrinologist and neurosurgeon consult, I'm doing my homework. This seems small enough to start treating with cabergoline or another dopamine agonist before considering a surgical route. My headaches, brain fog, and exhaustion are becoming debilitating and I can't risk my job, so I'm really trying to be proactive and set myself up for success with the medications, even before the prescriptions can be called in. 

This diagnosis was confirmed during infertility testing for PCOS. My symptoms have been around for a decade but have recently spiked significantly. I've been misdiagnosed in the past with: chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, endometriosis, and a host of other wishy-washy diagnoses by exclusion. As such, I've been self-medicating with THC for a long time. It alleviated the head pressure and headaches, seemed a better option than extra strength Tylenol every day, and gave me that dopamine I was clearly craving. But with 10 years of daily use (a few hits at nighttime, not all day), I recognize that my dopamine receptors are likely impacted and this may put the effectivity of the cabergoline at risk, so I'm looking to adopt some healthier behaviors.

Does this match anybody's experience? Did quitting marijuana restore some of your prolactin levels and help with the effectiveness of cabergoline? 

As I'm considering quitting (or severely tapering down), I'm wondering if there are other herbs that I could switch to. I've enjoyed the effects mugwort, blue lotus, chamomile, lemon balm, damiana, passionflower, mullien and lavender during THC breaks. Even a placebo effect could help with the adjustment, I think. I know that the effects of holistic and herbal options are under-studied but if anybody has a clue of what's safe and what isn't, I'd be appreciative.

Similarly, I have about 2-3 cups of black coffee per day. Any risk there?

I thankfully live nearby a major city research hospital with a nationally-ranked Pituitary Center, so I'm hopeful for successful treatment even if I end up needing surgery. But that's not the first line of defense, right? So might as well take it seriously.

1kboatc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kboatc/uncover_if_simpletaste_milk_frother_handheld_is/,Uncover if SIMPLETaste Milk Frother Handheld is the perfect choice review,"Crafting perfect froth at home used to feel out of reach until I got my hands on the SIMPLETASTE Milk Frother 706-0001. As a coffee and latte enthusiast, my mornings now come with a barista-level foam‚Äîsomething I never thought I could achieve without an expensive machine. This handheld frother has introduced a new ritual in my daily routine, and let me share the details of my experience.

**ELEGANT DESIGN & CONVENIENCE**  
This frother fits right into my kitchen setup, boasting a sleek gray design that feels more premium than expected. The inclusion of a stainless steel whisk and its glossy yet lightweight plastic body makes it easy to handle and visually appealing. Its stand, thoughtfully included with the product, ensures that storage is hassle-free. Whether it‚Äôs blending in my kitchen‚Äôs monochrome setup or sitting on the counter for easy access, this little tool has a compact charm.

**EFFORTLESS FUNCTIONALITY**  
One press of the button, and voila‚Äîperfect foam in under 30 seconds. I‚Äôm seriously impressed by how the frother operates; you press the button, and magic begins without holding it down. I‚Äôve used it with various liquids, and whether it‚Äôs almond milk, dairy, or matcha, the results never disappoint. Navigation is intuitive, even for early mornings when my brain isn‚Äôt yet revived by caffeine!  

[Check SIMPLETASTE 706-0001 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01lnfychm/)  

**HIGH-QUALITY BUILD & PERFORMANCE**  
After weeks of use, I‚Äôm convinced this frother will last. The whisk, made out of stainless steel, is resistant to rust and still retains its shine. The sheer power it generates‚Äîthanks to those 2 AA batteries‚Äîis nothing short of incredible. It whirs through milk and even thicker substances like cream with ease. However, I did notice the plastic body, particularly near the battery compartment, feeling delicate. While it hasn‚Äôt broken, I‚Äôve been mindful while handling it to avoid unnecessary strain.

**MULTIFUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES**  
It‚Äôs not all about foam! I‚Äôve started experimenting beyond lattes. Mixing hot chocolate powder with cold milk? Easy as pie. Need whisked eggs for omelets? This gadget covers it. Whipping cream for desserts? Done. Even my six-year-old nephew takes delight in using it under supervision, crafting mini ‚Äúmilkshakes‚Äù that bring him endless joy.

**HIGHLIGHTS**  
- Produces creamy, rich foam in under 15 seconds.  
- Rust-resistant and durable stainless steel whisk.  
- Comfortable single-press usage without holding the button.  
- Compact design with an included stand for tidy storage.  

**AREAS OF CONCERN**  
- The plastic body near the battery compartment feels less durable.  
- On/off button occasionally sticks.  
- May splatter if used in shallow cups, so better opt for deeper containers.  

**PRODUCT COMPETITORS**  
Naturally, I had to compare it with other milk frothers I‚Äôve tried before pitching this one to friends. Compared to brands like Zulay and PowerLix, this one‚Äôs motor feels just as powerful but operates without needing continuous pressure on the switch‚Äîwhat a comfort! However, in contrast, the build of the PowerLix model feels more robust, possibly due to an all-metal construction. Another close competitor, Smeg‚Äôs milk frother, excels in aesthetics and sturdiness but is exorbitantly priced, which leans me towards handheld simplicity.

**QUALITY FOR PRICE**  
Finding something affordable and reliable can feel like a treasure hunt, and this frother is a winning gem. You‚Äôre not just buying a kitchen gadget but ensuring your beverages have that luxurious foamy flair we often pay extra for at cafes. Not bound by cords and easy to travel with‚Äîthis milk frother is a trusty companion. For anyone who cherishes their drinks, it‚Äôs worth every cent invested into it.

I'm scared to call my neurologist and let him know because he already gave me a hard time for even wanting a second opinion and not ""starting topamax as the first line of treatment"".

1kbo8zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1kbo8zz/cursor_fitness_exercise_bike_review_a/,CURSOR FITNESS Exercise Bike Review: A Budget-Friendly Gem for Your Home Gym,"Hey there, fellow fitness enthusiast! üëã Ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to have a solid workout without shelling out a fortune for fancy gym equipment? Well, let‚Äôs talk about something that‚Äôs been on my radar lately: the CURSOR FITNESS Exercise Bike. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôre always on the hunt for gear that‚Äôs reliable, comfortable, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg. Spoiler alert: this bike might just be the hidden gem you‚Äôve been looking for.

I‚Äôve been diving deep into the world of exercise bikes lately, trying to figure out which one actually delivers on its promises without breaking the bank. The CURSOR FITNESS Exercise Bike (specifically the CBE30 model) kept popping up in my searches, and honestly? I was intrigued. It‚Äôs got a **4.7-star rating** on Amazon from over 300 reviews, which is no small feat. Plus, it‚Äôs priced way lower than big-name brands like Peloton or Schwinn. So, I decided to give it a closer look. And guess what? It‚Äôs pretty darn impressive.

Let‚Äôs jump right in and see why this bike might be your next fitness buddy.

# Overview of the Bike

First things first, let‚Äôs talk about what you‚Äôre getting with the CURSOR FITNESS Exercise Bike. This isn‚Äôt some flimsy, throwaway piece of equipment. It‚Äôs built with **high-carbon steel** and has a **triangular structure**, which gives it that sturdy, no-nonsense feel. It can support up to **300 lbs**, so it‚Äôs not just for lightweight users‚Äîit‚Äôs got your back (and your butt) no matter your size. One of the standout features is its **adjustability**. The seat can be moved in **four ways**, with **seven vertical settings** (spanning 7.9 inches) and **multiple horizontal levels** (4.4 inches). The handlebars? They‚Äôve got **five vertical adjustment levels** (4.8 inches). All of this means it‚Äôs perfect for riders ranging from **4‚Äô8‚Äù to 6‚Äô5‚Äù**. Basically, whether you‚Äôre a shorty like me or a tall drink of water, this bike‚Äôs got you covered.

And let‚Äôs not forget the design. It‚Äôs sleek but not overly complicated‚Äîno unnecessary bells and whistles here. Just a solid, functional bike that looks good in your living room without screaming ‚Äúgym equipment.‚Äù

# Features That Make It Worth Your While

Now, let‚Äôs break down what really makes this bike shine. Because, let‚Äôs be honest, features are where the rubber meets the road (or, in this case, where your feet meet the pedals).

# Seat Comfort

Okay, let‚Äôs get real‚Äîyour butt is going to be on this seat for a while, so it better be comfy. The CURSOR FITNESS bike comes with an **extra cushion ventilated saddle**. It‚Äôs wide, padded, and even has **ventilated zones** to keep you cool during those sweaty sessions. Plus, there are **dual rubber pillars** for shock absorption, which is a lifesaver for your joints. Most users rave about how comfortable it is, though a few mentioned it might not be perfect for *very* long rides. But hey, if you‚Äôre like me and switch things up with different workouts, it‚Äôs totally fine. One user even said, ‚ÄúThe seat is comfortable for a long ride‚Äù ([Amazon Review](https://www.amazon.com/CURSOR-FITNESS-Stationary-Adjustable-Handlebars/dp/B0D17L436M?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fitness0582-20&linkId=e1f92d92c7b22609658b0d38fe888b88&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)), which is music to my ears.

# Resistance Levels

This bike isn‚Äôt messing around when it comes to resistance. It‚Äôs got a **micro-adjustable tension system** with **100 levels**, ranging from 0 to 100. That means you can go from a gentle spin to a full-on leg-burning challenge. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or someone who‚Äôs been cycling for years, you can dial in the resistance to match your fitness level. IMO, this is one of the best features‚Äîit keeps things interesting and lets you grow with the bike. Ever tried cranking up the resistance for a quick HIIT session? It‚Äôs a game-changer.

# Display and Tracking

If you‚Äôre into tracking your progress (and who isn‚Äôt?), the built-in **LCD monitor** is a nice touch. It shows **time, speed, calories, heart rate, and distance** in real-time. It‚Äôs not a fancy touchscreen, but it gets the job done. Plus, there‚Äôs a **tablet holder** that can fit devices up to **12.9 inches**, so you can stream your favorite workout videos or binge-watch your guilty pleasure shows while pedaling. (No judgment here‚ÄîI‚Äôve definitely done both.) One small gripe from users is that the tablet holder doesn‚Äôt swivel, but for the price, I‚Äôm not complaining.

# Additional Features

Little things can make a big difference, right? This bike has **dual cup holders** on the handlebars (perfect for your water bottle or coffee‚Äîhey, no shame), and it even comes with **transportation wheels**. So, if you need to move it around your home (or hide it when guests come over), it‚Äôs a breeze. The bike‚Äôs **belt-driven system** also ensures a **quiet ride**, which is crucial if you‚Äôre in an apartment or don‚Äôt want to wake the whole house at 6 AM.

|**Feature**|**Details**|
|:-|:-|
|**Seat**|Extra cushion ventilated saddle, 4-way adjustable, shock-absorbing pillars|
|**Resistance**|100 micro-adjustable levels, suitable for all fitness levels|
|**Display**|LCD monitor tracks time, speed, calories, heart rate, distance|
|**Tablet Holder**|Fits devices up to 12.9 inches|
|**Cup Holders**|Dual holders for bottles up to 3.2 inches in diameter|
|**Transport Wheels**|Easy to move around|
|**Drive System**|Belt-driven for smooth, quiet operation|

# Assembly and Ease of Use

Let‚Äôs talk about the dreaded ‚ÄúA‚Äù word: assembly. If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably had nightmares about spending hours wrestling with Allen wrenches and cryptic instructions. Well, breathe easy‚Äîthis bike is **easy to assemble**. Users consistently mention that the instructions are clear, and most people can get it set up in under an hour. One reviewer said, ‚ÄúIt was easy to put together and I like the fact that it has wheels that makes it easy to move‚Äù ([Amazon Review](https://www.amazon.com/CURSOR-FITNESS-Stationary-Adjustable-Handlebars/dp/B0D17L436M?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fitness0582-20&linkId=e1f92d92c7b22609658b0d38fe888b88&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)). Once it‚Äôs together, using it is a no-brainer. The resistance knob is intuitive, and the display is straightforward. No need for a PhD in engineering here.

# Performance and Workout Experience

So, how does it actually ride? From what I‚Äôve gathered (and a little personal testing at a friend‚Äôs place), it‚Äôs **smooth and quiet**. The **belt-driven system** ensures a seamless ride, and the noise level is so low that you won‚Äôt disturb your downstairs neighbors‚Äîor your sleeping kids. (Trust me, that‚Äôs a big deal if you live in an apartment or have thin walls.) The stability is also top-notch; the **triangular frame** and heavy-duty construction mean no wobbling, even when you‚Äôre pushing hard.

One thing I love about this bike is its versatility. Whether you‚Äôre doing a light spin to warm up or going all out for a HIIT session, the adjustable resistance lets you tailor the intensity to your needs. And let‚Äôs not forget the comfort factor‚Äîthe adjustable seat and handlebars mean you can find the perfect position to prevent strain and make your workout more enjoyable. It‚Äôs like the bike was designed with *you* in mind. A user summed it up perfectly: ‚ÄúThis bike is amazing!! It is smooth and easy to put together!‚Äù ([Amazon Review](https://www.amazon.com/CURSOR-FITNESS-Stationary-Adjustable-Handlebars/dp/B0D17L436M?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fitness0582-20&linkId=e1f92d92c7b22609658b0d38fe888b88&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)).

# Comparison with Other Bikes

Now, let‚Äôs get real‚Äîthere are a lot of exercise bikes out there. Some are fancy, some are pricey, and some are just plain overrated. So, how does the CURSOR FITNESS stack up?

# Peloton Bike+

Let‚Äôs be honest, Peloton is the gold standard for connected bikes. It‚Äôs got live classes, a leaderboard, and all the bells and whistles. But it‚Äôs also over $1,000, not including the monthly subscription. The CURSOR FITNESS? It‚Äôs a fraction of that price and still delivers a solid ride. If you don‚Äôt need the fancy tech, this is a no-brainer. Plus, you can still follow along with workout apps on your tablet using the bike‚Äôs holder.

# Schwinn Fitness IC4

Another popular option, the IC4 is often seen as a more affordable Peloton alternative. It‚Äôs got adjustable resistance and app compatibility, but it‚Äôs still pricier than the CURSOR FITNESS. Plus, some users say it‚Äôs noisier. If quiet rides are your thing, the CURSOR FITNESS wins. It also offers **more seat and handlebar adjustments**, making it better for a wider range of body types.

# Sunny Health & Fitness SF-B1002

This is another budget-friendly bike, but it doesn‚Äôt offer as much adjustability as the CURSOR FITNESS. If you‚Äôre taller or shorter than average, you might struggle to find a comfy position on the Sunny. The CURSOR FITNESS, on the other hand, is like a chameleon‚Äîit adapts to you.

# Nautilus U614 Recumbent Bike

If you prefer recumbent bikes for extra comfort (especially if you have back issues), the Nautilus is solid. But it‚Äôs more expensive than the CURSOR FITNESS upright bike. That said, CURSOR FITNESS does offer a recumbent model too, which might be worth checking out [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Exercise-Stationary-Equipment-Recumbent-Adjustable/dp/B0D5MDPN2C?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fitness0582-20&linkId=a661b91dd4768fa7a32922cd88349896&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) if that‚Äôs your vibe.

In short, while there are definitely more feature-rich bikes out there, the CURSOR FITNESS Exercise Bike offers **excellent value for its price**. It‚Äôs like the underdog that punches way above its weight class.

|**Bike Model**|**Price Range**|**Key Features**|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CURSOR FITNESS CBE30**|\~$200‚Äì$400|100 resistance levels, adjustable seat/handlebars, quiet|Affordable, versatile, quiet|No touchscreen, seat may need padding|
|**Peloton Bike+**|\~$1,500+|Live classes, touchscreen, app integration|High-tech, community features|Expensive, requires subscription|
|**Schwinn Fitness IC4**|\~$800‚Äì$1,000|App compatibility, adjustable resistance|Good value, sturdy|Noisier, less adjustable|
|**Sunny Health & Fitness**|\~$200‚Äì$300|Basic resistance, compact|Very affordable|Limited adjustability|

# Customer Support and Warranty

Here‚Äôs where CURSOR FITNESS really shines. They offer a **5-year warranty on the frame structure** and a **1-year warranty on parts**, which is pretty generous for a bike in this price range. But it gets better‚Äîthey‚Äôve got a **24/7 support team** based in Los Angeles. So, if you run into any issues (like, say, a wobbly pedal or a missing screw), you can get help fast. From the reviews, it seems like they actually care about their customers, which is refreshing in today‚Äôs world of impersonal customer service. An X post even mentioned that CURSOR FITNESS goes ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù for customer support ([Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1h08d26/cursor_fitness_exercise_bike/)).

# Conclusion: Is It Worth It?

So, is the CURSOR FITNESS Exercise Bike worth your hard-earned cash? Absolutely. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable, comfortable, and adjustable exercise bike that won‚Äôt break the bank, this is it. It‚Äôs perfect for home use, whether you‚Äôre just starting out or you‚Äôre a seasoned cyclist. The build quality, features, and customer support make it a standout in the budget category.

Let me leave you with this: a few months back, I was debating between splurging on a high-end bike or going for something more affordable. I ended up trying out the CURSOR FITNESS at a friend‚Äôs house, and I was hooked. The ride was smooth, the seat was comfy (even for my, ahem, generous posterior), and it was so quiet I could‚Äôve been pedaling on a cloud. My friend, who‚Äôs been using it for over a year, swears by it and says it‚Äôs held up like a champ. That kind of durability is exactly what I look for in home gym equipment.

Plus, not everyone needs a connected bike with subscriptions and all that jazz. Sometimes, you just want to hop on, pedal, and get your heart rate up without any fuss. The CURSOR FITNESS bike lets you do just that. FYI, it‚Äôs also super easy to move around thanks to those wheels, so you can stash it away when your in-laws visit. :)

So, if you‚Äôre ready to take the plunge, you can check it out [on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3YW3WWN). And hey, as an affiliate, I may earn a small commission if you make a purchase through that link‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt affect the price you pay. Just my way of keeping it real while helping you out.

I never thought I'd come back here, but something else has happened.¬†¬†

For those of you that don't know, I made a post about a spirit that has essentially been haunting me for, at this point, four weeks. If you want to go ahead and read that first, maybe catch up a little, I went ahead and put a link to it at the top of this post. But for those of you that already know, I guess we can just go ahead and get started.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt expect that first post to get that much attention. Honestly, I thought people would just think I had gone insane. But that didn‚Äôt seem to be the case, and I even got a comment. I want to say thank you in advance for wishing me safety and address something that was asked.¬†¬†

*If it wanted to kill you or your kitty, it could have, so what* ***does*** *it want?*¬†¬†

I mulled over the question for days, gathering evidence along the way. I recorded every sound that beast made when it was trying to attack or just moving around the house. I wrote down every odd thing I noticed, every detail in the differences between it and Hades meows. I scribbled down pictures of what it looked like, of each form it would take. I even managed to capture a video of it lingering outside my bedroom door but when I tried to watch it my phone completely crashed and I had to buy a new one.¬†¬†

I think it figured out what I was doing.¬†¬†

The usual nighttime visit would happen at least four to five times between ten at night and three in the morning. But as the days passed it dwindled down to a mere two. Soon it was just an occasional sniff at the bottom of the door before it lost complete interest. I didn‚Äôt even see it in the morning anymore. The usual glimpses I would get were pointless because each time; it wasn‚Äôt there. I didn‚Äôt like that. I didn‚Äôt like that it had spent days tormenting me only to hide when I started to retaliate.¬†¬†

I became upset; desperate.¬†¬†

I started roaming the house at night.¬†¬†

Every night at one I would leave my room and walk around the house with nothing but the light of my phone to guide the way. I didn‚Äôt do much, mainly just stood around or rummaged through the cupboards when I was hungry. For five days I did this, turning my back on every strange noise or turning off my phone to be plunged into complete darkness. Anything to draw it out.¬†¬†

And yet, there was nothing.¬†¬†

I knew it hadn‚Äôt completely disappeared because that familiar feeling still stuck to my skin. I knew it hadn't complete disappeared because that familiar feeling still stuck to my skin like honey. The feeling that I was being watched. It was still there, still standing, still watching. But not advancing. It was merely‚Ä¶ waiting. But for what?¬†¬†

It was 1:30 and like the past few days, I was standing in the middle of the dark kitchen. My phone was pointing to the left, illuminating Hades' water bowl as he drank from it. I attempted to lower the device but as soon as the darkness began to touch the tips of his ears I was met with quite the ferocious glare.¬†¬†

""You're a cat, dumbass. You can see in the dark."" I huffed, eyes rolling as he turned back to the bowl. I lowered the phone despite the annoyed meow I received and looked around the room. The only light besides my phone was the clock on the microwave that I was convinced was there to mock me. Hours of sleep missed over something that I was starting to think really *was* just a nightmare.¬†¬†

At that point I figured it was time to give up, but something in my head was nagging for me to do just one more test. The thought dug a hole into the back of my brain like maggots burrowing into a rotting carcass. I couldn't ignore it. So, I turned off the phone and plunged myself into the darkness.¬†¬†

I stared into the void that was supposedly the living room, watching each little wisp of change that my eyes managed to pick up. There's something funny about the darkness and how it could enhance the senses. Suddenly my ears were picking up on sounds I never made an effort to notice. A dog barked out from a house up the corner, the cry of an ambulance rang from the distant road followed by maybe two or three police cars. ¬†¬†

My eyes adjusted slowly to the dark environment, and I could start to see the outline of furniture. The couch was big and unconventional like always. The chairs at the dining room table weren‚Äôt pushed in all the way. There was a paper bag on the floor just at the corner of the counter, something Hades had been obsessed over ever since we brought it home from the local market.¬†¬†

But no monster.¬†¬†

I sighed; shoulders slumped in defeat. There was no point in trying anymore. I don‚Äôt even know why I was trying so hard to find it. Did I want to prove that it was real? That I wasn‚Äôt crazy? What would I have even done if I did manage to prove its existence? There have been countless claims of monsters throughout human existence, mine would just be written off as another thing. A myth.¬†¬†

‚ÄúC‚Äômon Hades let's just... go watch TV or something. I‚Äôll put on some cartoons. I need something relaxing to watch.""¬†

He meowed, stepping away from the bowl to rub against my leg before advancing forward. I trailed behind but didn't get very far because Hades paused at the edge of the kitchen. He stared into the living room, the fur on his back slowly rising as his body arched in a position that looked ready to attack. My eyes widened. In the ten years we've had Hades, I had never seen him like this.¬†

I acted on instinct, pulling a knife from the shelf before scooping him up with one arm. He didn't fight, curling against my chest as he yowled at the void ahead. I held the knife at the ready, breath hitching as a familiar noise reached my ears.¬†

*Footsteps.*¬†

My grip tightened, my breathing slowed, it felt like time had stopped. There was only me and the darkness.¬†

The light flickered on, and I screeched, waving the knife around like a mad man.¬†

""Fuck you! Fuck you, you ugly bastard! Stay away from me!""¬†

""Hey, hey! Calm the fuck down!""¬†

I froze, finally letting my eyes adjust to the sudden brightness of the kitchen. My gaze flickered towards the light switch where my dad was standing. His arms were hung at his sides; hands balled into fists. His brows were knit together in anger, yet his eyes still looked tired from being woken up.¬†

""What the hell is wrong with you? It's almost two in the morning and you're skulking around in the dark with a knife. Put it down. Now!'¬†

I complied, turning to tuck the knife back where I had found it. Hades stayed curled in my arm, eyes directed towards my father. Even when my neck blocked his view, he kept his head in that same direction. I knew Hades didn't have much of a fondness for him, but the looked in his eyes was odd. Like he was looking at a complete stranger.¬†

""Sorry, dad."" I mumbled, feeling embarrassed for having been found such a way. ""I was just trying to-""¬†

""I swear to god if you bring up that damn thing *again*, I'll do more than just yell.""¬†

Whatever response I had tried to come up with deflated on the spot and my body suddenly felt a hundred times heavier. He wouldn't have listened to any kind of excuse anyway. I don't know why I even bothered to try.¬†

He watched as I rushed past and down the hall to my bedroom where I could hear him yell just one more time before shutting the door,¬†

""You're lucky you didn't wake up your mother. And if I catch you doing this again, I won't be as nice!""¬†

Yeah, I stopped after that. I didn't want to find out what my dad would do if he found me in the dark again. Luckily mom was on my side. She scolded my father for scaring me and even tried to suggest that I might have been sleepwalking (Which I have never done). He didn't really like that argument but eventually backed down.¬†

I didn't get off with just a warning though. He started making me do yard work as a punishment. Chopping up wood, mowing the lawn, raking up leaves. It sucked. The only housework I want to do is the video game kind; at least then I get some kind of money for my work, even if it is digital. I didn't complain though, I couldn't. In my dad's mind the only pain that mattered was his own. It didn't matter if it was mental or physical, if you complained you were ungrateful for all he'd done and needed to shut the fuck up.¬†

He'd always been a piece of shit. I'm surprised my mother even stays with him. If it was my choice, we would've both been gone years ago. Maybe life would actually be good.¬†

But his shitty personality is the very reason I knew something was wrong. One day he just started being nicer. He made me breakfast; a full breakfast. Eggs, bacon, homemade cinnamon waffles. I remember checking the calendar that day to see if it was a special occasion, but it wasn't. It was just the 26th, just a Saturday. The starting point to the worst five days of my life.¬†

On the 27th he made pancakes that seemed to be buried under a mountain of whipped cream and blueberries. He gave my mom a rather long and gross kiss before leaving to get the grocery shopping done early. As soon as the front door shut, I turned to her.¬†

""Mama?"" I slid the berries and cream off my pancakes. ""Does dad seem‚Ä¶ weird to you?""¬†

""What do you mean, baby?""¬†

I paused. How do you even go about this kind of topic?¬†

""He just seems off lately. Happier, I guess? Did we win the lottery or something?""¬†

""Not that I know of. Why do you ask? Don't you like being pampered?"" she chuckled into her mug of coffee.¬†

""It's just strange. He's never been, you know, that nice. You don't even like being around him sometimes. I mean how could you?"" It was a bad attempt at humor, something to lighten the mood and maybe get her to open up more. But instead of laughter, I was met with a death glare.¬†

""Your father is doing his best for this family. if you don't appreciate it, keep it to yourself.""¬†

""Whoa! Mama I- I didn't mean to be mean or anything it's just-""¬†

""No! Take your pancakes and go eat in your room. Go!""¬†

I'm man enough to admit that I almost cried right there at the table. My mother yelled on very few occasions and even if she did it was never directed towards me. Nineteen years and this is the first time I'd ever been shouted at. It was honestly frightening. For the first time in my life, I felt frightened of my mother.¬†

I didn't even bother with breakfast; I had no appetite anymore. I just stood from the table and ran off to my bedroom where, now that I was alone, I did cry. Not necessarily because of the shouting, even though it did play a part.¬†

No, I cried because of the way she looked at me as I left the table. Like I was a burden. Like she hated me; truly and deeply. That wasn't my mother, it couldn't have been. That thing did something to her.¬†

It did something to them both.¬†

As the days passed, they got worse. My mother became more angry, more violent. I had accumulated at least seven different punishments in the span of two days. Some were justified; I had started roaming the house at night again due to paranoia. Others were for small things, like when I complained about the heat even though she had done the same not even five seconds before.¬†

My father started requesting more time together. He taught me how to bake bread and cooked my favorite meals. He even took me out to the art museum, something I had been wanting to visit since we first moved here. It was a wonderful time, and he even stopped at a few places to get fro-yo and a brand-new game console. He hadn't bought me a proper gift in over a decade. Lord forgive me but whatever that thing did to my father might've just been a blessing.¬†

He was the complete opposite of his former self, they both were. It was almost like they switched personalities and then multiplied their habits by hundreds.¬†

All good things don't last though, because today was the day it all crumbled.¬†

I had been in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I heard it; the shouting. My mother. I had slowly gotten used to it over the past three days, though I couldn't help but flinch when I heard her smash a plate against the floor which was followed by the sound of my father's please for her to calm down.¬†

I leaned over the sink to spit up the mixture of toothpaste and saliva in my mouth when my ears decided to block out every sound but one. A thump. Something had been hit. I froze. Had my mother become deranged enough to put her hands on my father? No, surely not. My head turned to the open doorway to yell out, to ask if something was wrong, when I heard something else.¬†

Hades' cry.¬†

I bolted to the kitchen where my mother stood in the middle, body shaking with anger, my father was a few steps ahead of her, eyes wide and shaky hands raised in a placating manner. I looked around, heart dropping when I noticed the small lump behind him.¬†

It was Hades. He was laying on the ground, eyes shut and body limp. His breathing was heavy, but it was still breathing.¬†

My fists curled.¬†

""What did you do to him?""¬†

No response.¬†

""What the fuck did you do to him?!""¬†

""She kicked him.""¬†

I looked at my father and he looked back. There were tears in his eyes.¬†

""He only wanted a treat.""¬†

I choked on a sudden sob, directing a glare in my mother's direction. She just stood there and stared. She didn't care, not one bit. I watched as her lips curled high, higher than what was physically possible.¬†

She was proud. Proud to have hurt Hades, proud to have frightened my father to the point of tears, proud to see the way I seethed with anger.¬†

And she was only getting started.¬†

I remember the way her body contorted. The sounds of bones breaking as limbs twisted and turned in directions they weren't supposed to. Her lower half was backwards now, legs bent and positioned like a spider. Her torso fell against the ground like that part of her had gone limp, arms elongating and claw-like nails digging into the tiled flooring. Her eyes rolled back like they weren't connected to the socket and her upper lip protruded like some kind of duck bill, one long sharp tooth positioned at the front. I can still see the way her jaw hung like it was broken. I can still hear the noise she made, a low groan that bubbled up from her gut.¬†

I heard my father whimper before Hades was suddenly shoved into my arms.¬†

*""Run.""*¬†

She bolted forward as soon as that word left his lips, feet pounding against the floor as she used her nails to drag the upper part of her forward. I ran down the hall as she toppled him, listening to the sounds of his screams as I shut and locked the door.¬†

I laid Hades on the desk before prying the window open and grabbing a pair of scissors. I stabbed into the window screen, twisting the end until a small hole formed just big enough for me to cut out the whole thing. After tossing the scissors aside, I picked up Hades and tucked him underneath my shirt.¬†

""Baby?""¬†

Her head hit the door.¬†

""Come unlock the door for your mama.""¬†

Her claws reached underneath the bottom, scrapping against the hardwood.¬†

*""Let me in you little bitch!""*¬†

She slammed her body against the door, making the whole room shake. The house filled with the sounds of her shrieking, claws digging at the floor so hard that the panels started to come up. I heard the creak of the doors hinges and knew I had to hurry.¬†

So, I dove out the window.¬†

My body curled protectively around Hades as we rolled down the hill before coming to a complete stop against the road below. I stood slowly, blinking to refocus my gaze, and ran. I ran until it hurt to breath, until my legs were screaming with pain and my throat felt like sandpaper. I ran until were on the opposite end of the neighborhood and outside Miss Beatrice's house.¬†

My side slammed against the front door at full speed, body sliding downwards to slump on the porch. I watched as the lights flickered on and listened to the sound of her approaching footsteps. My vision darkened just as the door opened.¬†

I woke up to Hades licking my cheek and about three different policemen standing around me. Apparently, Beatrice had called the police after finding me unconscious and directed them to my home in worry that my parents had been abusing me. Honestly, I wish it were that simple.¬†

They told me that every light in the house was on when they went to go check it out. My bedroom door had been smashed to bits and the room itself was completely destroyed. The kitchen was a mess, cutlery all over the floor and the glass of the oven door shattered along with it. In front of the dining room table was a puddle of blood where my father had been attacked. A trail of it led to one of the windows which had been completely torn from the wall. There was no body.¬†

I gave my statement, recounting every detail I could remember. They looked at me like I was crazy, I think they even considered bringing me in. But Beatrice somehow talked them out of it.¬†

Speaking of, she had offered for me to stay until I was capable of living on my own. She tidied up the guest room as nicely as she could and baked some fresh cookies to help 'bring a little cheer' after what I had been through.¬†

So now I'm here, eating some cookies and watching a random movie from her collection of VHS tapes. Hades is stretched out against my leg, ears raised and alert for any possible danger. We're going to take him to the vet tomorrow to make sure my mom didn't do any permanent damage to him.¬†

I don't know if she's still out there or if she even knows where I am. I don't know if she's ever going to come back.¬†

All I know is that for the first time in four weeks, I'm in a safe place.¬†

And I'm going to enjoy my time here.¬†

If you are in ecom running cold outreach or just trying to build lead lists, you know how difficult (and expensive) it can get when you are looking for leads. I used to pay around $450 a month for unlimited access to store lead data but I was always stuck with limitations and proxies which is not ideal

Fast forward to now I have been using Scrapeamax and it completely changes the game. I am scraping unlimited leads from platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce and others all for less than your coffee budget (Yeah its that affordable)

Whats awesome about this is that it is UNLIMITED, doesnt require proxies, no credit system and you can get super specific with your lead targeting

Let me break it down for you:

Target any ecom store: Apparel, sports, tech whatever industry you're interested in

Filter by country: Want US based stores? no problem you can scrape leads from any country.

Revenue filtering: You can even filter stores based on how much they are making like 50K, 100K, 500K+ in revenue

Easy exports: Get all your leads in seconds, straight into a CSV file with all the details you need (company name, location, website, social media links, etc)

For example I have scraped 300,000 leads in just a few minutes and the list was packed with actionable data and all this for way less than what I was paying for other scraping services

Not only that but if you are in the cold outreach game this is gold. I have had better responses simply because I can scrape high intent leads directly from ecom stores that match my ideal customer profile

How to get started:

Just head over to Scrapeamax(.)com or hit me up if you want more info. You can get a feel for whats possible before committing. I have used it for a few months now and its been a game changer

Feel free to ask questions if you are curious and I have been using this system for a while now so happy to help anyone out who wants to save time and money while building quality lead lists",0,1746038470.0,coldemail,2,0.33,False

# - Embrace flexibility in your workday.

¬†

Adopting a flexible approach to your workday allows you to tailor your schedule around your most productive hours and personal commitments. By breaking free from the traditional 9-to-5 model, you can align your tasks with when you feel most energized and inspired. This adaptability not only enhances your efficiency but also helps maintain your well-being, as you can take breaks or work during hours that best suit your lifestyle.

¬†

Additionally, embracing flexibility encourages creativity and innovation. You can experiment with different work environments, whether that‚Äôs a cozy coffee shop or a peaceful corner of your home. This fluidity can lead to fresh ideas, as new settings often stimulate new ways of thinking. As you cultivate a routine that respects both your professional goals and personal needs, you‚Äôre more likely to remain motivated and invested in your work, ultimately contributing to your success as a solo entrepreneur.

¬†

# - Leverage technology to streamline operations.

¬†

Incorporating technology into your operations can significantly enhance your productivity and efficiency. By utilizing tools such as automation software, project management applications, and customer relationship management systems, you can reduce manual tasks and minimize errors. This not only saves you valuable time but also allows you to focus on the core aspects of your business that require your unique expertise and creativity.

# - Build strong connections with your audience.

¬†

Establishing genuine connections with your audience is essential for the success of your one-person business. By engaging authentically, you create a sense of community and loyalty that encourages repeat business and referrals. Take the time to understand your audience's needs, preferences, and pain points; this allows you to tailor your offerings and communication strategies accordingly. Utilize social media platforms, newsletters, and personal interactions to share your story and values, fostering a deeper relationship that goes beyond transactions.

¬†

Encouraging feedback and actively listening to your customers can further solidify these connections. When your audience feels heard and valued, they are more likely to advocate for your brand and contribute to its growth. By prioritizing relationships over mere sales, you cultivate a supportive network that not only sustains your business but also enhances its reputation in the marketplace. In a landscape where consumers crave personalized experiences, building strong connections will set you apart and drive long-term success.

¬†

# - Focus on niche markets for success.

¬†

Delving into niche markets can significantly elevate your one-person business by allowing you to cater to specific customer needs in a way that larger competitors often overlook. By honing in on a particular segment, you can tailor your products or services to meet the unique preferences and challenges of that audience, establishing yourself as an expert in that field. This targeted approach not only distinguishes you from the competition but also fosters a loyal customer base that appreciates your specialized knowledge and offerings.

¬†

When you focus on niche markets, you can streamline your marketing efforts and messaging, ensuring that you attract the right customers who resonate with your brand. This clarity helps you allocate resources more effectively, allowing for organic growth through word-of-mouth referrals and community engagement. By embracing a niche strategy, you position yourself as a trusted voice within that space, inviting opportunities for collaboration and partnership, which can further enhance your business's visibility and success.

¬†

# - Prioritize work-life balance for longevity.

¬†

Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for the sustainability of your one-person business. By setting boundaries between work and personal time, you not only enhance your productivity but also foster your overall well-being. This equilibrium allows you to recharge and remain motivated, reducing the risk of burnout, which can be detrimental to both your mental and physical health. Prioritizing your personal life alongside your business ensures that you have the energy and creativity to tackle challenges and seize opportunities when they arise.

¬†

As you navigate the demands of running your business, remember to schedule regular breaks, unplug from work after hours, and engage in activities that bring you joy. Implementing routines that support your health and happiness will contribute to your longevity as an entrepreneur. Ultimately, a balanced lifestyle will enable you to sustain your passion for your work and continue to innovate, ensuring that your business not only survives but thrives in the long run.

¬†

In conclusion, as you navigate the evolving landscape of 2025, it‚Äôs clear that one-person businesses are not just a trend; they are a thriving force. With the rise of technology, flexibility, and a growing demand for personalized services, you have the opportunity to carve out your niche and connect directly with your audience. Embrace the tools and resources at your disposal, stay adaptable, and remember that your unique perspective is your greatest asset.

Hi everyone,

Is there anyone here who owns a coffee, croissant, or donut franchise in Spain?

I'm curious about how it's working out for you.
Do you feel it was a good decision, or do you have any regrets?

I'd really appreciate your insights and experiences

1kbnyao,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbnyao,Updated floorplan.,"Hello! I updated the tiny house floor plan from last time. I hope you guys like it. It's around 40 sqm including porch. Main house is 20 sqm. I made the conservatory a bit bigger compared to last time because I wanna put the cat tower in there. I changed some pocket doors into swing doors so I can install a cat door especially in my bedroom. I tried to put a cat litter inside the main house and out in the conservatory so she won't have any accidents anywhere in the house. The 2nd cat litter is right below the box bay window. I figured would it be nice so I can also have somewhere to sit while I wait for my food to cook. 

This will be in the city and I have a sort of small land so, a tiny house that can fit me and my cat with a bit of other luxuries such as a conservatory and a reading nook would be amazing!

Just to explain the weird set up I have here, 

AWM - I only wanted a small washing machine. The one I'll be getting has a max. capacity of 4.5kg the reason why I wanted to go smaller is because I don't really have much clothes and plus it's cheaper compared to the big stackable ones. I was thinking of only handwashing my clothes since I never really needed a washer dryer before but I'm glad I can buy one even if it's small.

The loft can be accessed via a rolling library ladder. They don't have that option in the website I used to create this floor plan so, I just got a bit creative. It's the bracket-looking thing on the outer bathroom wall. That's where it will sit when it's not needed, I'll have it pushed up against the wall so I won't trip over it when I walk around the kitchen. 

I'll DIY most of my furniture including the cat tower. So pray for me, haha. I know the placement of the bathroom is really awkward and plus the toilet is facing the door, I couldn't think of any layout I could do to fix that. 

I was thinking of getting one of the bench seats on the front porch to swing, that would be cool. I don't know if that's possible tho.

I'm not really a big TV person so, I didn't install one and plus, I'll be needing that wall to hang the foldable chairs, the table folds up on the wall too!

The giant couch right there turns into a dining area too. I can seat at least 6 people on there. The coffee table can be turned into a dining table and if I want to turn it into a bed for my siesta or stargazing, I can do so too! So, it's a couch, a dining table and a bed all in one, haha! That's what I originally planned in the first tiny house floor plan I wanted to build, it was 18 sqm but since I have a cat, I don't mind the extra space.

By the way, I live in a very hot country so, heaters aren't really that necessary for me. I've never had an air conditioning before tho but I'd like to add one even if it's just in my bedroom since I'll be working there too. 

I opted for a small house (This ain't tiny anymore, it's pretty big. 40 sqm is not what I had in mind but just for my cat to have a comfortable house to walk around in and watch the outside without having to go out especially when it rains and for her safety too, I don't mind spending a bit more money to add that space. I have a very limited budget and I don't know where I saw this but extending a house is much more expensive compared to having a simple and basic conservatory built. So, I hope that's true. Wow, I typed a lot. Please let me know if there's anything I can add here or take away. Thank you! Last pic is the whole lot (140 sqm) ",1,1746038398.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False

Is this a reasonable plan, or will it look/feel bad only being on one part? Should I poly the whole thing? Or should I just leave it without, will just Danish Oil be enough here?  What would you do?

So I wanted to taper off the atenolol, even though i was still getting pacs here and there while on Atenolol.  my cardiologist told me fine, but what i need to do is take half for the next two weeks then come off.  i tried for a couple days but the Atenolol is really small and hard to cut.  I had some metoprolol 25mg on hand and those are prescored and they snap in half easily, so i took half metoprolols instead.  well, as the week progressed, my pacs got worse.  one saturday i left work early to go to the er because it got so bad.  so I started taking the full 25mg metoprolol. pacs still didnt let up, and then boom.  Monday, my heart was erratic all day long.  went to my cardiologist, they hooked me up to ekg and found i was in afib.

some life decisions that may have led to me getting afib at 46.

1.  i used to drink, ALOT.  id drink, then wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing.  this happened all through my 30s.

2.  i did lots of high intensity workouts.  i used to be real into CrossFit.

3.  super high stress job.  i was a car salesman up until today.  i quit and found a new job.

4.  this is maybe a big one, i dont know, but I use Zyn 6mg.  i go through about half a can a day.  i think all that nicotine in my bloodstream all day may have led to afib.

5.  caffeine.  i used to drink energy drinks in my 20s, 30s but in my 40s i drank about 20-30 oz of black coffee a day.

6.  this is a weird one, but i used to keto diet alot too.  theres been studies showing that long term ketogenic dieting may lead to heart rhythm disturbances.

[Hey Monika](https://preview.redd.it/ceymdus9n0ye1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b3b8920eac1b9422fbc609c3db74ed3d92f148)

Hello, everyone. It has been some time since my last update or post. I'm not dead, and the project isn't either. I have some good news about DDLC Keeper of Reality.

First of all, I'm extremely sorry for the huge wait and delay. I'd love to blame it on the project being too difficult or long, but in reality, it was just my own laziness and lack of motivation to work on the project. But that comes in waves, and I've been in my working mood recently, so I've been using it as best as I could. Coffee is my fuel right now.

can

Now, time to talk about the project. Keeper of Reality is practically finished. I've drawn most, if not all, of the CGs and assets. There's still some stuff left, but it's just like less than 5% of all of It, and I can just finish it in a day or two.

At the moment I'm writing this (April 30th) , I have to:

* Fix Monika's Thighs (I'm not joking)
* Finish and add a day counter (Mostly done)
* Finish a mysterious character's fate
* Make the credits (Doesn't take long)

After that comes my final playtest and then the closed beta, to make sure everything flows correctly. And I'm going to take my time with the beta, as this act is not only quite long, but I'll also make an update on Act 1 so it connects cleanly with Act 2.

In Act 1 I will:

* Update the sprites
* Redraw some CGS (And others will go as some of them are irrelevant to the story)
* Update the music
* Remake the credits
* Update the story

Hopefully, this won't take long, and I'll be finished when the beta ends. So, if for some reason you want to play the current Act 1, you can do so as it will be up until the update. Or you can wait for the update. Up to you.

The plan is to release the updated Act 1 and then, a week or 2 weeks later, Act 2, because I think players would like to play/replay Act 1 before Act 2.

So, when is it releasing? I'd like to release it in late May or the first week of June so let's hope everything goes okay and life and college doesn't get that much in my way.

Thank you all for your support, and special thanks to those who sent me their good wishes in comments and messages.

Here are some teasers of what's coming:

1kbnryu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1kbnryu/vent/,Vent,"I hate myself and I hate my life. I‚Äôm 45, mother of many (19 down to 1 year old) and I know I am failing as a mom and a wife. I told my husband the other day that I was the default parent and now he has been mad at me since Monday. It‚Äôs only Wednesday morning and the kids have been crazy. I have to take kids to counseling appointments, music lessons, etc, and while I am gone a kid pokes their finger into the loaf of bread that was freshly made. They all know not to do this. I had to take the 8 year old and 7 yr old with me bc they would not listen to their sister who ended up yelling at them (because she sees me yelling). Food was stolen- single serve coffee creamers- 20 of them over the weekend. No one fesses up. My other daughter feels overwhelmed and resorts to self harm and I have to tell her that everything will be ok when I don‚Äôt know if it will. The kids make a mess of their dirty clothes all the time. Even when they put away clothes in their own dresser they put away clothes that belong to other people. I have to constantly be on them to make sure they are doing the right thing. 

My husband says there is value in being a SAHM and I just don‚Äôt see how I, me personally, am that value. He could hire someone else to do all the house work. Sure, if I died, the kids would have a hard time for a while but they would eventually be functioning adults. I would want my husband to move on. I really want him to find someone else that will make him happier. I said that I was the default parent bc everyone asks me everything. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I am in the other room and someone else is in the kitchen- they come find me and ask me. If I try to take a nap the kids are never quiet. They are running up and down the hallway, screaming in the stairs, making it impossible for me to sleep. And then the older kids will yell at them. I have to manage all the dental and medical appointments and their home school stuff. I have to meal plan and cook and I just hate that right now. I dread looking at the next week in my planner. 

I see all of this as my fault, my bad parenting, my bad temper. And now the hubs is mad at me and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I did apologize to him, but he is keeping his distance. Which is fine. But I just don‚Äôt understand how things can be so good for a few hours and then it all goes to crap. We had sex a week ago and made out, skin to skin. I just needed to be with him and forget about the kids and everything else that is going on. I told him how much that time meant to me- it was more than just sex for me (and for him). Monday was ok, but I was still upset about things- being a SAHM, no degree, no job, not being intelligent. And now it‚Äôs just terrible. I ruin everything between us. 

What if my only purpose in life is to be his wife and bear his children and take care of him till one of us dies? I feel like that‚Äôs all I am- a tool to be used and my value is only in my work and how well I raise my kids. I don‚Äôt want to divorce my husband, I do love him, and I wouldn‚Äôt survive on my own anyways. I‚Äôm trying to earn a certificate for medical coding and billing just to have something of my own that I can do at home with flexible hours. He thinks I will be more frustrated and won‚Äôt have the time to do any of it. He says he hopes he is wrong and that it works out for me in some way. I just don‚Äôt even know what my life would look like without kids to take care of. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done for the past 20 years. 

I‚Äôm just well past my limit and don‚Äôt know how to change things. I don‚Äôt know how to be happier or content with where I am. I‚Äôve given up on praying, having faith or hope. What is there to hope for or have faith in if I am going through the hard time and God is supposed to be with me and comfort me? What if the hard time doesn‚Äôt end while I am alive? How am I supposed to be comforted? 

Anyways‚Ä¶ I know this is long and this is the only way I can get rid of these feelings. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to and I don‚Äôt want to burden the few people that I do talk to. 

And to make matters worse, my FIL and MIL are visiting this week. They know I am having a hard time and I don‚Äôt want the kids to bother them and I don‚Äôt want them to ask questions about my mental health or how I feel about things. So now I am hyper vigilant to make sure the kids don‚Äôt overwhelm them or I offend them in some way.

So my father married a filipino woman 20 years younger who kicked me out at 8 years old. He would have me for one night a week.

This was all because the wife had started screaming and demanding him to call my mother and that I had to leave, because I was just a curious kid while having a shower before bed. I noticed this bodywash I had never seen before so I had a look. It was slippery, fell out of my hands which led to it opening and the lid cracking on the side. I even apologized for it.

Didn't see or hear from him for years, every time I tried to contact him to talk, she would make him hang up the phone. She changed numbers but my uncle would always give it to me as he wanted me to have it. I got invited to their house was when they were celebrating their daughter's 3rd birthday (which was random but I got to see my cousin so that was cool), and when he wanted to adopt her niece from the Phillipines. I just said I didnt care

15 years later I'm visiting family in my home town, and decided I would contact him once to see if he would meet for a coffee after asking his brother for his number. Surprisingly he does - but it's only because she wasn't home.

It was awkward, but after all I was the one who made the decision to give him the choice. All he talked about was how his other daughter was doing this and how his wife got a new car and how they went to the US etc. I won't lie, it made me feel shitty deep down. So I changed the subject and I decided to ask him about his hobbies and how the pace car was going. It was one of the things I was supposedly meant to inherit, but he sold it because she wanted the money.

She tried to have him completely get rid of me. Convinced him to write me out of the will - not sure how that works, and apparently dumped my pictures

So now hes 78. Retired and freshly divorced. Barely any money to his name as she drained it all, and they left to aus. I was already planning to move there myself and have been sorting that out for the last couple of years on my own, but he now has no one that can care for him, so I'm the only one who's left around (his brother is older and that wouldn't be fair on him nor his wife). 

Because I'm too soft I said I could, but I don't know how to feel. Regret because I kind of feel like I'm now putting my life aside knowing what happened for all those years, but also guilty for feeling this way and I don't know if its right or wrong.

I understand he's hurting and going through the stress of this happening at his age, but you'd think his other daughter would step up after the life he gave her. Nope. She took 20k and moved. Talked to him once on new years and once in March I believe to ask him for more money, which he gave her.

I eventually found out the bodywash was to clean her nether regions. AITA?",12,1746037948.0,AmItheAsshole,43,0.93,False

Hello, everyone. It has been some time since my last update or post. I'm not dead, and the project isn't either. I have some good news about DDLC Keeper of Reality.

First of all, I'm extremely sorry for the huge wait and delay. I'd love to blame it on the project being too difficult or long, but in reality, it was just my own laziness and lack of motivation to work on the project. But that comes in waves, and I've been in my working mood recently, so I've been using it as best as I could. Coffee is my fuel right now.

can

Now, time to talk about the project. Keeper of Reality is practically finished. I've drawn most, if not all, of the CGs and assets. There's still some stuff left, but it's just like less than 5% of all of It, and I can just finish it in a day or two.

At the moment I'm writing this (April 30th) , I have to:

* Fix Monika's Thighs (I'm not joking)
* Finish and add a day counter (Mostly done)
* Finish a mysterious character's fate
* Make the credits (Doesn't take long)



After that comes my final playtest and then the closed beta, to make sure everything flows correctly. And I'm going to take my time with the beta, as this act is not only quite long, but I'll also make an update on Act 1 so it connects cleanly with Act 2.

In Act 1 I will:

* Update the sprites
* Redraw some CGS (And others will go as some of them are irrelevant to the story)
* Update the music 
* Remake the credits
* Update the story

Hopefully, this won't take long, and I'll be finished when the beta ends. So, if for some reason you want to play the current Act 1, you can do so as it will be up until the update. Or you can wait for the update. Up to you.

The plan is to release the updated Act 1 and then, a week or 2 weeks later, Act 2, because I think players would like to play/replay Act 1 before Act 2.

So, when is it releasing? I'd like to release it in late May or the first week of June so let's hope everything goes okay and life and college doesn't get that much in my way.

Thank you all for your support, and special thanks to those who sent me their good wishes in comments and messages.

Here are some teasers of what's coming:

I‚Äôm genuinely frustrated by how quickly people dismiss Japanese dramas after watching just *one* or *two* poorly chosen titles. J-dramas don‚Äôt suck, people just pick the wrong ones and then make wild generalizations.

If your only experience is watching something like *Coffee and Vanilla* (which is fine for a guilty pleasure, sure), then of course you're going to come away thinking the whole industry is fluff or lacking depth. But that‚Äôs like watching *The Heirs*, *Love Alarm Season 2*, or *Tempted* and saying ‚ÄúK-dramas are all shallow‚Äù while ignoring brilliant, critically acclaimed series like *My Mister*, *Because This Is My First Life*, or *Signal*.

Japanese dramas like *Unnatural*, *Jimi ni Sugoi*, *Long Vacation*, or *Yugure ni, Te wo Tsunagu* offer emotionally rich storytelling, nuanced characters, and creative freedom that often surpasses other East Asian industries. But they rarely get flashy promotion, especially outside Japan, so casual viewers miss them entirely.

Every drama industry has both fluff and brilliance, you just have to look beyond what's trending or heavily marketed. Dismissing an entire country's storytelling based on one forgettable drama isn't just lazy, it's unfair.

I decided January 2025 that i was ready to focus on myself, when my toddler turned two and i can focus a bit more on myself. Suffered from some bad PPA/PPD and was prescribed lexapro a year and a half ago, which caused some weight gain. Now, after 12 weeks of CICO tracking and light workouts, I'm  halfway to my goal!

40f, 5'4"", SW 180, CW 164, GW 150

I use lose it! to log meals and track macros, and a fitbit to track calories out/exercise. Im a spreadsheet nerd and have been plugging in as much info as i can to chart my progress. Ive been averaging 1422 calories in and 2772 calories out over the last 12 weeks, with a deficit goal to be around -1250 per day. I'm averaging 13,000 steps per day, with running, walking, dumbells, bodyweight workouts, 12-3-30 treadmill, and yoga for exercise. its not consistent but I fit in what i can with my busy schedule.

My diet is boring.   
Breakfast: black coffee, protein shake  
Lunch: salad w/ dinner protein leftovers, no dressing  
Snacks: nonfat greek yogurt w/ granola, apples, oranges, nuts  
Dinner: salad/green vegetable, protein (chicken, steak, pork), rice, quinoa or sweet potato

I try to get >100g of protein per day but rarely getting above 80, and though I've managed to get my fat grams under control I'm noticing my carbs grams are constantly high, though from looking at my meal logs those carbs are mostly from fruits. I haven't given up wine or vodka, and I don't want to. I eat very little processed foods and eat out about once every few months. 

The first month I lost 5 lbs, the second I lost 7, and this final month I lost 4. What can i do to ramp up weight loss these next 3 months? Lower my calories in? ramp up calories out? bit of both?

***Washington***

***2014***

The worst part wasn‚Äôt the silence. It was how quickly people learned to live inside it.

Owen Geralds sat in the back row of the stake high council room, hands folded, wedding ring cold against his knuckle. The chairs had been rearranged‚Äîno longer the half-circle they used for planning meetings, but a line. A row of obedience. He was two seats down from where he used to sit. No one looked at him. Not even Ethan. Especially not Ethan.

President Hayes had opened the meeting with a scripture from Doctrine and Covenants, something about order and stewardship, the kind of passage that felt holy until you heard it in a voice that made your stomach turn. The prayer had come next. Then the sustained callings.

Owen waited for the release announcement that never came. He wasn‚Äôt mentioned.

No thanks for years of service. No formal release. No reassignment. Just a new counselor stepping into his old chair and a note passed to him at the end:



***Thank you for your continued faithfulness.***



He had smiled as he folded it, then crushed it slowly in one fist.

That was the last sacrament meeting he ever attended.

The garage was quieter than usual that night.

Sawdust clung to the workbench. A hammer was left out. One of Dean‚Äôs old wooden Pinewood Derby cars sat on a shelf, chipped paint and all. Owen stood there staring at it, thumb pressed hard against his palm. His hand still ached from earlier.

The drywall bore the mark of that ache‚Äîfresh, indented, splintered in a perfect arc of knuckles.

Langley showed up unannounced three days later

Owen had been fixing a gate out back when the truck pulled in‚Äînew model, dark red, still smelled like a showroom. Langley climbed out, sunglasses on, jaw tight. He walked right up without saying hello.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve both been in this too long to pretend,‚Äù Langley said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôll just ask: Are you trying to make noise, or are you just losing your grip?‚Äù

Owen didn‚Äôt answer. Langley stepped closer. ‚ÄúBecause if it‚Äôs the first one, you should know‚Ä¶ noise doesn‚Äôt last around here. We handle things quietly. Always have.‚Äù

Then, calm as Sunday, Langley reached out‚Äîlike to dust off Owen‚Äôs collar‚Äîand clipped him just under the eye with a knuckle.

‚ÄúBe careful where you lean,‚Äù he said, smiling. ‚ÄúBalance is everything in carpentry. And callings.‚Äù Owen didn‚Äôt report it. Didn‚Äôt ice it. Just stared in the mirror that night and watched the bruise rise beneath his eye like a tide.

The last good picture of Owen Geralds was taken a month before he died.

He was standing in the garage beside the router table, grease on his jeans, holding up a tray of freshly cut dovetails for the cabinets he never finished. Dean‚Äôs mom had snapped it without warning. He was squinting in the light, one eye slightly swollen, knuckles raw and red.

Dean hadn‚Äôt noticed at the time. Not really. But when he looked at the photo later‚Äîafter the funeral, after the sealed casket, after the eulogy that never said his father‚Äôs name more than twice‚Äîhe saw it all. The signs. The truth behind the silence.

Owen had been unraveling. Quietly. Carefully.



He was called into the Stake offices midweek and told there were ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù about his recent remarks in Sunday School‚Äîconcerns about tone, not doctrine. Language that could be ‚Äúmisunderstood.‚Äù

Ethan Hayes was there alongside Brother Langley and another counselor‚Äînewly sustained, freshly minted in a crisp white shirt and soft smile. They spoke like HR reps, not shepherds. One-handed Owen a printed sheet titled *Strategic Stewardship Review*.

At the top, in clean font:



***Area of Concern: Ideological Drift***

***Recommendation: Temporary Reassignment***

***Status: Observing Period (Discreet)***



He didn‚Äôt yell or argue. He folded the paper, slid it into his back pocket, and walked out without shaking hands.

That night, he punched the garage wall so hard the drywall cracked. He didn‚Äôt wrap his hand. Just rinsed it and kept working.

Then he sat in his truck with the door closed, engine off, and stared at the ceiling like he was trying to keep something from spilling over.

He pulled out his phone.

The call log showed a missed call from Dean two days earlier‚Äîprobably just checking in. Owen hesitated. Then he hit record.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúJust me.‚Äù

There was a pause. Like he thought about deleting it mid-message. But he kept going.

‚ÄúI had a meeting today. With President Hayes. Behind closed doors. Just him and me.‚Äù

Another pause.

‚ÄúHe asked me to go along with something. Said it‚Äôd be ‚Äòtemporary stewardship,‚Äô nothing official. Said it would help the stake. Help you.‚Äù

His breath hitched once, audible through the static.

‚ÄúI told him no. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to be used.‚Äù

A shaky exhale.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll say next. What story you‚Äôll hear. But I want you to know‚Ä¶ I love you, son. No matter what they tell you next.‚Äù

The message ended there‚Äîabrupt and uneven.

Owen didn‚Äôt replay it. Just sat in the quiet, the phone still in his hand, before sliding it face down on the dash.



That weekend, Nora took the girls to her parents for a weekend visit. Sister Myler brought a small casserole. Said she the spirit had given her the feeling that Owen could use some comfort food. Her dish was cheesy and smelled like thyme and smoked paprika. Owen reheated it for his dinner, trying to bury his feelings in the richness of food.



***Day One***

The next morning, Nora stopped in to check on him. He looked pale and sick, so Nora took his temperature. Owen didn‚Äôt argue. He was feeling off‚Äîjust a little nauseous. Probably the rich food, he told himself.



***Day Two***

He couldn‚Äôt shake the headache. The shop lights looked too bright. His hands trembled when he tried to sign off an invoice. When he looked up from the workbench, the world had a yellow tint‚Äîlike someone had smeared Vaseline on the windows.

He rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúJust tired,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúWorn out.‚Äù

That night, he sat alone on the porch and tried to write a letter to Dean. Tried, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Every sentence felt like a trap. Every thought was a ticking clock.



***Day Three***

He threw up in the sink before breakfast. Couldn‚Äôt keep coffee down. The room spun when he stood too fast.

Nora begged him to go to urgent care, but he brushed it off. ‚ÄúBug going around,‚Äù he said.

She caught him talking to himself in the garage later, muttering phrases under his breath like he was arguing with ghosts. He waved it off. But she noticed how pale he looked. How he held the wall when he walked.



***Day Four***

He collapsed. Just for a moment‚Äîon the floor of the kitchen, right beside the fridge. His fingers twitched. Pulse barely there. Nora called 911.

By the time the paramedics arrived, he was awake again, embarrassed. ‚ÄúDehydration,‚Äù he lied. ‚ÄúStress.‚Äù They ran a portable EKG. The tech‚Äôs eyes narrowed, but he didn‚Äôt say much, but he recommended following up with a doctor. Owen nodded, but never went.

That night, in the quiet, he finally opened his old mission journal and tore out a single page. On the back, in shaking pen:



***If obedience is the root of virtue, let it be to God‚Äînot the men who pretend to speak for Him.***



He folded it. Slid it into a used envelope. Wrote ***For Dean*** on the front. Then he slid it into the false bottom of his scriptures‚Äîthe same set Dean would inherit.



***Day Five***

He died before sunrise. Nora found him slumped on the couch, the TV still glowing with an old baseball game. His hand was curled around a photo of Dean in Ukraine, taped to the back of the *Stewardship Review* form he never turned in.

The official cause was heart failure, but there were no autopsy results released. Just a closed casket and a tight-lipped bishop. A congregation full of eyes that wouldn‚Äôt meet Nora‚Äôs.

1kbnnia,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1kbnnia/unorthodox_sub_placement_for_an_unorthodox_room/,Unorthodox sub placement for an unorthodox room?,"First thing, I just have living room.  Not a theater or a listening room, just a living room.  And it's fairly small, just 12'x12'.  It needs to be a space for movies, music, having coffee, a place for the kids to do their homework, the cat tower is in there too.  

It's got other ""issues"" too; a door to the front staircase in the right corner of the front wall, large old rattly windows on the left and back walls and a wide opening to the dining room on the right wall. 

Secondly the seating consists of a 4-person couch with an ""L"" right up against the back wall and a 2-person love seat perpendicular to the couch on the left wall.

I say all this just to illustrate it's never going to be an *ideal* space, and I've made my peace with that.

So from what I've seen most people keep their sub(s) somewhere near their front speakers near or along their front wall, which makes sense, and that's where I've had mine since I first setup my ""system"" a few years ago during the pandemic.

But I've been thinking lately about moving it to the back left corner where the people sitting on either the couch OR the love seat might feel the low end better.

Anyone else done something similar?

It's also a question of priority and ""ethics"" to a degree, lol.  If you're dealing with an imperfect space and a less than ideal seating layout, do you shoot for the BEST possible sound for whomever is in the primary listening position?  Or do you aim for a *pretty good* experience for as many listeners as possible?

Obviously I could just go ahead and move the sub to the back left corner and see how it goes, then move it back where it was if I don't like it.

But I guess I'm talking about more than just that, and I'm hoping to hear from other people whose spaces are challenging, and to learn about the creative ways they've adapted their setup.

1kbnmsz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbnmsz,Help with choosing furniture and orientation of a formal Living Room,"Hi everyone,  
My first time posting here, kinda nervous. I‚Äôve been following this sub for a while and finally decided to ask for advice on decorating my parents' formal living room. The house has an open floor plan‚Äîwhen you walk in the front door, the living room is immediately to the right, and the formal dining room is to the left of the living room.



I‚Äôve included some AI-generated images to help visualize the space (we don‚Äôt have actual photos yet, but the renderings are pretty accurate). The room has an angled wooden ceiling and Brazilian teak flooring‚Äîboth on the darker side. AI tools suggested going with lighter furniture to balance things out, which I‚Äôm leaning toward.



**A few key features:**

* The fireplace has granite at the base and a wooden mantle (from the previous owners). I‚Äôm open to updating this if it's budget-friendly.
* My goal is a *timeless but refreshed* look‚Äînothing too modern or trendy.
* I‚Äôm also unsure about what kind of art or decor to hang up, so I'd love input there too.



**Layout dilemma:**

In the floor layout, the 119in wall is the side of the stairs, and then the 142in is the opening to the dining room. 

I was thinking of placing a sofa along the left side of the fireplace (perpendicular to it), with two accent chairs facing the fireplace and a coffee table.

Then, in the corner between the fireplace and the front door, I‚Äôd like to create a smaller conversation nook with two chairs and a small table; a kind of ""European salon"" vibe for intimate chats.

AI suggested putting the two accent chairs on the opposite side of the sofa instead, but I feel like that layout looks too closed off when entering through the front door. I want to keep the space feeling open but still functional. Instead of the two chairs and table I'm also open to maybe a sofa or something, maybe a chaise lounge type?

Appreciate any ideas on furniture, colors, decor, or even changes to the fireplace setup. Thanks in advance!",0,1746037597.0,interiordecorating,2,0.5,False

By the time the paramedics arrived, he was awake again, embarrassed. ‚ÄúDehydration,‚Äù he lied. ‚ÄúStress.‚Äù They ran a portable EKG. The tech‚Äôs eyes narrowed, but he didn‚Äôt say much, but he recommended following up with a doctor. Owen nodded, but never went.

That night, in the quiet, he finally opened his old mission journal and tore out a single page. On the back, in shaking pen:



***If obedience is the root of virtue, let it be to God‚Äînot the men who pretend to speak for Him.***



He folded it. Slid it into a used envelope. Wrote ***For Dean*** on the front. Then he slid it into the false bottom of his scriptures‚Äîthe same set Dean would inherit.



***Day Five***

He died before sunrise. Nora found him slumped on the couch, the TV still glowing with an old baseball game. His hand was curled around a photo of Dean in Ukraine, taped to the back of the *Stewardship Review* form he never turned in.

The official cause was heart failure, but there were no autopsy results released. Just a closed casket and a tight-lipped bishop. A congregation full of eyes that wouldn‚Äôt meet Nora‚Äôs.

## **The Good**
- **Early Turnaround Signs:** The Back to Starbucks strategy is showing early indicators of recovery‚Äîespecially in North America, with partner (employee) engagement up and turnover at a record low (under 50%).
- **Improved Customer Experience:** Investments in staffing, technology, and streamlined routines have improved speed of service and connection with customers. Testing labor and order sequencing pilots has already reduced wait times substantially.
- **Menu & Product Innovation:** Positive customer response to product changes (e.g., sugar removed from matcha, new Cortado platform, and food innovation in Canada). Matcha sales up nearly 40%; food sales in Canada up 12.5%.
- **Brand Strength:** Highest percentage of customers ranking Starbucks as first choice in two years. Positive feedback on new marketing campaigns and increased social engagement (TikTok engagement up 3x).
- **International Strength:** 8 of 10 top international markets returned to flat or positive comps. Japan has achieved 16 consecutive quarters of comp growth; UK and Middle East also showing positive trends.
- **Operational Improvements:** Shift Marketplace update has improved scheduling flexibility and shift coverage, leading to more shift completions and a better partner experience.
- **Commitment to Capital Returns:** Continued dividends, strong balance sheet, and focus on durable, sustainable growth and ROIC (Return on Invested Capital).
- **Cost Control Initiatives:** G&A expenses down 3% YoY, and a focus on reducing new store build costs and renovation expenses.

---

## **The Bad**
- **Financial Underperformance:** Q2 EPS ($0.41) down 38% YoY, and operating margin contracted 450 basis points to 8.2%, primarily due to labor investments and deleverage.
- **Negative Comp Sales:** Global comp store sales down 1%, with US comps down 2% and transactions still declining (though at a slowing rate).
- **Margin Compression:** Heavy labor investment, while positioned as necessary for the turnaround, is currently a margin headwind with no immediate offset.
- **Muted Store Growth:** While long-term plans remain ambitious, management is intentionally slowing new store builds and renovations to address cost structure and design, potentially impacting near-term growth.
- **Limited Guidance:** New CFO Cathy Smith is still ramping up and did not provide detailed forward guidance, leaving investors with uncertainty about the pace of improvement.
- **Restructuring Costs:** Ongoing restructuring, with more expected as the turnaround continues, adds to near-term expense and uncertainty.

---

## **The Ugly**
- **US Traffic Weakness:** US transaction decline at -4%, and the recovery here is described as slow, with the turnaround expected to take time.
- **EPS Not the Focus:** Management openly discourages tracking EPS as a measure of turnaround progress at this stage, implying continued earnings volatility and underperformance.
- **Historical Labor Missteps:** Admission that prior strategies removed too much labor in favor of equipment, which failed to deliver the desired customer experience‚Äîrequiring costly course correction.
- **Uncertainty Around Macro/Consumer:** Management notes that the consumer environment is uncertain and acknowledges that if the macro deteriorates, Starbucks will be impacted.
- **Store Economics Pressure:** Higher new store and renovation costs have eroded the historical IRRs (internal rate of return) Starbucks expects‚Äîa reset is needed.
- **Rewards Program Issues:** The Starbucks Rewards program had devolved into a coupon program, leading to ""choppiness"" and lower quality transactions. Fixing this may take time and impact traffic/ticket in the interim.

Since January, there have been new tennants. The shop play extremely loud drum and base music from 7am to 9pm every day, 7 days a week. And I am not exaggerating when I say I can hear it even when I have my headphones in playing music. Friends cannot understand how it's not driven me crazy.

They are a coffee shop that are known for have a surround sound system and playing thumping base music (I know- crazy but it attracts the student population!)

I've gone down and asked them to be quiet a couple times and been shrugged off by staff. The only time they were apologetic and turned the music off was when it was 11:30pm.

I filled in a noise diary and submitted it to the council who...have not replied after 3 months and me following up and calling.

I'm at the point now where I'm unable to work from home and it's significantly impacting my sleep and mental health as, although I'm usually awake by 7am, waking up on a Sunday to blasting music isn't enjoyable and my days of quick naps are long gone! 

My questions are:

Am I just screwed and will have to bite the bullet and move out or can I pursue any other courses or action? Are they breaking any laws? The music is very rarely on before 7am or after 11pm. ",0,1746037081.0,LegalAdviceUK,2,0.5,False
1kbnfae,https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/1kbnfae/entitled_nurses/,Entitled nurses.,"
Hi everyone,

Yesterday, I was sitting at the nurses‚Äô station taking my 10-minute break. The nurses from the AM shift had already left by 7 PM, and the new shift had just started. I was drinking water and briefly checked my phone to see the time when a nurse said, ‚ÄúThe call lights are going off.‚Äù I immediately got up to answer them.

One of my patients asked me to heat up their coffee, so I went to the microwave behind the nurses‚Äô station. While I was there, I overheard the nurse speaking with the ADON, claiming that I was sitting down and not answering call lights. Since I‚Äôm a registry CNA, that kind of report could put me on the ‚ÄúDo Not Return‚Äù list.

I quickly texted the ADON to ask if I could speak with her. At that moment, the same nurse turned to me and said, ‚ÄúCan you not be on your phone?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm texting the ADON to clear my name. When you told me to answer the call lights, I was actually on my 10-minute break.‚Äù

I also reminded her that it‚Äôs not only the CNAs‚Äô responsibility to answer call lights‚Äîit‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job. After I told her that, she finally started helping with them.

It‚Äôs frustrating because sometimes a patient could be falling off the bed while I‚Äôm in the middle of changing someone, and instead of helping, others expect me to drop everything to respond‚Äîeven when they are available. Many of the nurses where I work don‚Äôt help with anything and get upset when we tell them a patient wants their medication. ",71,1746037072.0,cna,25,0.97,False

### Training
 
This training cycle was probably one of the most difficult marathon training cycles I‚Äôve had. This past winter was the coldest winter that the area I live in had experienced in quite some time, and there were days where it was so cold that it was unsafe to do a workout outside (because of ice) or the temperatures were cold enough where I had to adjust workout paces and be smart about the cold and impacts on performances. The first few weeks of training featured a lot of lower mileage, adjusted training plans, and safely getting in runs and workouts whenever possible. 
 
To add onto the colder-than-usual winter, I‚Äôve been dealing with a sore groin and abductor since last summer. I was able to keep it at bay during the fall marathon training cycle (I was able to run sub-3 marathon results at Indianapolis and Valencia), but it was still hanging around and it didn‚Äôt feel great after completing runs. (The colder-than-usual winter didn‚Äôt help it either). Knowing that I wanted to have a solid Boston training cycle, I decided to regularly see a PT. This was well worth the investment; over the next few months, the soreness gradually went from a regular occurrence to an occasional occurrence, and physically I felt a whole lot better after finishing up runs and workouts. Another motivation for seeing a PT regularly was that I read too many stories where Boston runners rolled up to the start line with varying degrees of injuries from training, and I did not want to be like one of those runners. 
 
During this training cycle, I ran anywhere 55 and 70 miles per week. Here were some key workouts that I did during this cycle.
 
* Nine weeks out: 20 miles with 12 miles alternating mile repeats (alternating between 6:15 per mile for a mile followed by 6:40 per mile for a mile), which I did 9 weeks out
* Eight weeks out: 10 x 1 K at 10K pace with 2 minutes jog recovery in between, which I did 8 weeks out
* Five weeks out: tune up local half marathon that happened to be quite hilly. I ended up treating it as a workout on the second half of the race to mitigate injury risk, and finished with a sub-1:25 result.
* Four weeks out: 6 x 1 mile at 10K pace with 90 seconds rest in between (5:57 per mile for the 10K pace), which I did 4 weeks out
* Three weeks out: 22 miles with 4 x 3 miles at MP (6:28-6:32 per mile). It felt quite smooth, even when doing this workout with temperatures in the 60s and high humidity. 
* Two weeks out: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run. I treated it as a workout and did not race it all out; I ran this at slightly faster than marathon pace (6:27 per mile).
 
In addition to the above key workout sessions, I had a few high aerobic sessions where I ran miles at slightly slower than marathon pace (6:50-7:10 per mile). I also did some hill work early on to prepare for the rolling hills found on the Boston course, but my coach decided to cut back on it to avoid straining my groin and abductors while I was continuing to rehab it. This decision ensured that I remained mostly healthy for the rest of the training cycle. However, this also meant that I came in very underprepared on the hills in Boston (and I would feel it during the race). Ultimately, this was the right call my coach made; it was a choice between showing up healthy and being able to put together a decent race, versus coming in injured and risk having a sub-optimal race (or worse, aggravating existing injuries and dropping out). Between the two, the choice was obvious.
 
I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt include my A, B, and C goals. Considering the issues I dealt with during this training cycle and the challenging nature of the Boston Marathon course, it was important to have these goals in case my race went sideways so that I had other goals to fall back on and avoid a situation where I was second guessing myself or letting intrusive thoughts win during the race. I assessed that the chances of my race going sideways at Boston was significantly high because of the nature of the course itself. Based on how my training and workouts went, I established these goals for myself:
 
* A goal: Sub-2:50 marathon
* B goal: Sub-2:55 marathon
* C goal: Finish with a sub-3 hour marathon result 
 
Above all, I wanted to make sure I was able to make it across the finish line and squeak under 3 hours. I was on the verge of becoming a Six Star Finisher, and I did not want to let this opportunity slip away.
 
### Pre-race
 
I flew up to Boston on Friday, and met up with my parents who flew out from the West Coast to see me run Boston. I went to the expo on Friday and spent a few hours there picking up my bib and checked out the booths. Over the weekend, I spent time checking out the pop up stores on Newbury Street, checked out some sights, but otherwise tried to not walk around too much. I mainly ate at coffee shops for lunch and hit up numerous restaurants in the North End neighborhood for dinner. Talking to friends who have ran Boston before, they told me that restaurants gets packed during Boston Marathon weekend, and so I booked reservations for the North End restaurants at least a couple months in advance, and that was a clutch decision on my part; it removed one significant source of stress that could have existed on that weekend. I‚Äôll likely do this again the next time I run Boston in the future.
 
Otherwise, everything else went smoothly leading up to the race. I got plenty of sleep (received 7-8 hours of sleep each night), drank Maurten 320s in the evenings as part of my pre-race fueling strategy, and I did not experience any last-minute pop up injuries. The night before, I did my usual pre-race routine the night before the race by preparing my race kit and loading up my drop bag with items I‚Äôd need after I crossed the finish line.
 
On race morning, I woke up sometime after 5 AM and had a bagel, banana and water for breakfast, and I put in another bagel in my small area bag to bring with me to Athletes‚Äô Village. I left my hotel after 6:30 AM and walked over to the Boston Common to board the school buses. It took me about 15 minutes after I reached the entrance to the bus lines to board the school buses, and the bus departed for Hopkinton as soon as it loaded to full capacity. The bus ride to Hopkinton took about an hour; on the bus ride there, I chatted with a few guys around me, and I got to know a bit more about them: where they came from, how they got into Boston, and their goals for the day. Those guys invited me to hang out with them at Athletes‚Äô Village, of which I readily accepted.
 
Arriving at Hopkinton, we were dropped off at the high school and walked into the fields behind the school itself. I spent the next hour and a half going to the porta potties a couple of times, hanging out with the guys that were on my bus, getting a picture with the famous Hopkinton sign, and eating my second small breakfast while waiting for my wave (red wave/corral 1) to be called up. My wave was called up at 9:30 AM, and I began my three-quarters mile walk to the start line. Near the start area, I stopped by the porta potties one more time, put on sunscreen offered by the organizers after seeing that the sun was going to be shining brightly throughout the day (this turned out to be a wise decision), and walked over to my corral and lined up with everyone else who was seeded in my corral. I made some small chat to fellow runners around me while we waited for the race to start.
 
After the National Anthem was sung and the typical pre-race remarks were made, the gun went off at 10 AM, and after a minute I crossed the start line and we were off!
 
### Race

## Conserve on the Downhills (Miles 1-6)

I‚Äôve read advice from Boston veterans too many times to count that the first few miles are crowded (because of the narrow roads), run by effort and stay in place instead of weaving around, and to not panic if your mile splits are slower than what you‚Äôd expect. I adhered to that advice for the most part; I went by effort for the first few miles to get warmed up and stayed in place even when others around me zoomed ahead. I took a Maurten gel during the first couple of miles to get me going.

During the first few miles, I looked around and couldn‚Äôt believe myself. After qualifying and not making it on the cutoffs the first time, then subsequently running faster marathons to make it in on the second try, I was finally here. *I am running the freaking Boston Marathon for the very first time*. I was smiling throughout this stretch and taking in the cheering crowds who gathered during this stretch. A few runners saw that I was going to become a Six Star Finisher (I had a special bib from Abbott WMMs that was pinned to the back of my racing singlet) and came up to me to congratulate me.

I came through the first 10K in just a bit over 40 minutes and my splits were a touch slower than what I had planned for. This was perfect; I didn‚Äôt go out blazing hot on the downhills and risked overcooking myself during the second half. So far, so good. The crowds greeting us as we ran through Framingham were solid, too!

## Cruising Along (Mile 6-16)

After the downhill-fueled first few miles, the course flattened out around mile 6 and I eased into my marathon effort/pace. There were rolling hills along the way, and I navigated through them by effort (notably when there was an uphill around mile 15 followed by a steep downhill on mile 16). For the most part, I felt mostly good through this section. The crowds greeting us at Natick was solid, but the so-called ‚ÄúWellsley Scream Tunnel‚Äù at mile 12 was incredibly unreal after reading all about it over the years. They were cheering their heads off and it was nonstop cheering for almost a mile. I took the opportunity to go through the crowds and high fived as many of them as possible (Unfortunately, I did not kiss any of the women there; that‚Äôll probably have to wait for next time!). There were thick crowds when I ran through downtown Wellsley, where the halfway point was. I came through the halfway point in 1:26 and change. Race Screen suggested I was on track to finish in the 2:52 range. I thought to myself *‚Äùnot too bad, this was a solid first half by you, but the hard work now begins‚Äù*.

By this point, the sun was shining *very* brightly and temperatures were in the 50s. I started to feel the heat from the sun and the warmth from the sun being reflected off the road surfaces. I began to pick up water from those aid stations and tossed it on myself to keep myself cool. Thank goodness for the aid stations that were present every mile! As for fueling, I took a Maurten gel sometime after mile 7, and my first Honey Stinger caffeinated gel sometime after mile 12. 

## Control Through the (Newton) Hills (Miles 17-21)

After the steep downhill on Mile 16, we entered Newton and shortly after I encountered the first of the four hills and started the climb. The hills were no joke; while they were short in distance, they were quite steep. After climbing the first two hills, I realized I had a problem on my hands: my legs were not bouncing back on the downhills afterwards. The climbs was harder than I was expecting, and I was losing a lot of time on the hills. As mentioned earlier, I had to cut out hill repeats to mitigate injury risks. But now this was coming home to roost, and not in a great way. Finally, I was feeling the heat from the sun, despite my best efforts to take water from aid stations and toss it on myself every mile. Altogether, the heat and my undertrained legs meant I was putting in a lot more effort than usual when climbing the hills. Things were starting to look dire for me. Race Screen went from a 2:52 prediction to a 2:54 prediction and it was now showing a 2:56 prediction.

Quickly pulling myself together, I assessed my A, B, and C goals. I quickly realized that my A and B goals were quickly slipping away and that this was not the day to go after them. I only had my C goal left. Before the race, I rehearsed this scenario in my mind in if I ever found myself in a situation like this, and this was now the moment I had to make the call. Whatever decision I chose to make at this pivotal moment, it was a decision I would have to live with for the rest of my life. That said, it was an easy decision for me to make; being an experienced marathoner, I was aware of my own limitations and I also leaned on lessons learned from similar situations I encountered in my previous marathons. If everything went off the rails, I was going to do everything I could to make it across the finish line under 3 hours. And don‚Äôt do anything to push myself beyond my physical limitations. The alternative would be far worse: pushing myself beyond my physical limits would result in cramping, being reduced to a run/walk during the last few miles, and the outcome would be one that I was probably not going to be happy with.

I made the decision to aim for a sub-3 marathon result. There was no going back now.

The last two hills took forever, but finally I saw the banner for Heartbreak Hill ahead of me as I began to climb it. Slowly but surely, I crested Heartbreak Hill, and a downhill greeted me on the other end. *Finally, I was completely out of the woods. Less than 5 miles to go*. The crowds on the Newton hills made it slightly bearable, but it was still a bit more suffering than I‚Äôd like.

I took one gel on this stretch, but my stomach was starting to feel somewhat queasy, so I took small sips of water and Gatorade and gently coaxed my stomach.

## (Trying to) Conquer the Final Stretch (Miles 21-26.2)

Coming out of Heartbreak Hill, I tried to get my legs going on the downhill portions over the next few miles. But my legs took a massive pounding on those hills, and now I was feeling it in my quads and calves. And I was at higher risk of cramping because of fatigue. I kept going and did my best to hold it together. During this stretch, I took a couple of brief walk breaks around the aid stations to gather myself and make sure I had enough in me for the final push towards the end. Race Screen showed that I was on track to finish in the mid-2:58s, then it started to slip towards the low 2:59s. It became clear to me that all I had to do was to hang on and I could finish Boston with a sub-3 hour result.

I ran through Cleveland Circle (and dodging the train tracks there) and started to pick off increasing number of runners who were now reduced to jogging or walking on the roads. I slowly counted off the remaining miles and did my best to keep myself mentally motivated, telling myself that I was getting close to the finish. Sometime after mile 24, I saw the Citgo sign ahead and knew that mile 25 (and the ‚Äúone mile left‚Äù mark) was coming up, and I focused on the Citgo sign as it got closer. I held myself back as I gingerly navigated the final overpass on the course, then picked it up on the other end as I approached Kenmore Square, then through the ‚Äúone mile to go‚Äù mark. Crowds were very thick in the final mile, and they were cheering us on throughout the rest of the way as we got closer to the finish line.

After navigating the final underpass and emerging on the other end, I saw a right turn just ahead. This was it. *Right onto Hereford, left onto Boylston*. I played this scene many times in my head, and now I was going to do the thing for the very first time in my life. 

Right onto Hereford, then a (wide) left onto Boylston shortly after, I saw the finish line ahead of me. *I was going to finish the Boston freaking Marathon!*. I looked at my watch and Race Screen told me I was just going to finish a touch above 2:59; barring any unforeseen circumstances, I was going to come through the finish line in just under 3 hours. I began to celebrate while running down Boylston, taking in the crowds, waving my arms and engaging with the crowds. A wide left onto Bolyston got the attention of one of the official race photographers who was posted there, and they got some good shots of me starting my celebrations. The crowds were incredibly unreal cheering for us runners as we approached the finish line. 

As I approached the finish line, I smiled big and put my arms up in triumph, knowing that I got the job done. After working so hard to qualify and make it into the Boston Marathon, this was the moment I was waiting for.

I crossed the finish line in 2:59 and change, fulfilling my dreams of racing and finishing the Boston Marathon.

Upon crossing the finish line, I became a Six Star Finisher, fulfilling my dreams of becoming a Six Star Finisher and capping off this journey that took six and a half years to complete.

### Post-race
 
After crossing the finish line, I took in a moment to soak in the atmosphere at the finish line. *Holy crap I finished the Boston freaking Marathon!* This moment was nothing like any other finish line experience that I had. Finishing a marathon is one thing, but finishing a prestigious race with a storied history is a whole different feeling.
 
I slowly hobbled my way forward through the finishers chute and I received my finishers medal first, followed by my post-race recovery bag. Volunteers there were cheering us on and congratulating us for a job well done. I ran into a few running friends who finished around the same time as I did, and we made small talk about our races while slowly walking down the finishers chute together. We approached the Six Star medals tent, and they witnessed me receiving my Six Star Finishers medal. It was a very emotional and moving moment for all of us. Afterwards, we went our separate ways, and I eventually found my parents at the family reunion area. That evening, I had dinner with my parents and afterwards I went out to celebrate with a few running friends at the local bars.
 
I spent the following day taking it easy and walking around Boston and taking pictures with my medals (the Six Star medal plus the medals from the other major marathons). Wearing the Six Star medal on its own drew a lot more attention from the public than I was expecting; a lot of people came up to me to congratulate me on achieving this accomplishment. I talked to a few of those people who congratulated me and quite a few of them were also pursuing the Six Star Finishers goal as well. 
 
### Final Thoughts
 
As for how I was feeling after racing Boston, this was the first time in a long time that I had no regrets post-race or wondered whether I could have done things quite differently during the race. The experience running the Boston Marathon for the very first time is so magical and unlike anything you ever experienced, and I made sure to take it all in and completely enjoy it, knowing that I can only experience being a first-time participant at Boston once in my lifetime and I did not want to lose sight of it. I reminded myself about this even when I was struggling coming out of the Newton hills and running the remaining miles towards the finish line. And of course, the right turn onto Hereford and left turn onto Boylston and marching down to the finish from there while the crowds were cheering their heads off was incredible and out of this world. I felt very content and completely at peace after I raced at Boston, knowing that this concludes a chapter in my running career (one where I focused on qualifying, making it into Boston, and running the Boston Marathon itself. I look forward to a new chapter in my (amateur) running career and focus on other goals, whatever that might look like.
 
And to top it off, I am officially a Six Star Finisher, with sub-3 marathon results from all the major marathons!
 
That said, the Boston course is quite hard and the rolling hills were no joke (especially after the pounding from the downhills during the first half), and I'm still feeling the effects of it while writing this. If I were to do things differently when training for Boston next time around, I would probably do 1) start the training cycle 100% healthy and 2) do more hill work if rehabbing injuries weren‚Äôt a factor. Looking back, the difficulty of the Boston course itself was a good metaphor for my Six Star journey: it was not easy and there were times I had to overcome challenges along the way. It turns out Boston served as my final challenge that I had to beat in order for me to earn my Six Star Finishers medal; I had to rightfully earn it through hard work, blood, sweat, and tears.

I will come back and run Boston again someday, but I am in no rush to do so, especially after fully experiencing Boston for the first time and I am still riding the high from it. (I also don‚Äôt have a qualifying time and it looks like [it is shaping up to be high cutoffs this year]( https://runningwithrock.com/boston-marathon-cutoff-time-tracker/), and I‚Äôd probably wait for the dust to settle before thinking about next steps).
 
The Boston Marathon experience exceeded all expectations I had, and I saw why it has such a storied and legendary reputation. It was an incredible and amazing experience that was well worth waiting for, after qualifying for it previously and missing the cutoff, and then making it in on my second attempt. As someone who started marathoning at the back of the pack (I finished my first marathon in the low 5 hour range), it still blows my mind that I made huge improvements over the years and eventually was able to qualify and make it into the Boston Marathon. (Big) dreams do really come true after all. For those out there that are grinding out there to qualify and make it into the Boston Marathon: dedication, persistence, and consistency will bring you a long way, and you‚Äôll find a way to make it in one day (whether you do so as a time qualifier or as a charity runner). And it will be well worth it when you finally make it in.
 
Thank you, Boston, for everything. I will never forget this for the rest of my life.

She used to invite me over just to eat cake with her and her friends ‚Äî small, simple things that felt oddly intimate. We talked more and more, until one day we had our first video call. She wouldn‚Äôt show her face. ‚ÄúMy hair‚Äôs messy,‚Äù she said. It wasn‚Äôt the last time she‚Äôd hide from me. Later, she told me she had autism.

Conversations with her felt like walking a tightrope. Often one-sided, fragile. We tried meeting at the park once, but she canceled, said her leg was hurt. I started to notice a pattern ‚Äî hesitation, distance, walls that never came down. Still, I cared.

She told me I was treating her differently ever since she told me about her autism. She shared stories of being abandoned by her ex, of being replaced by another guy. Her words were always tinged with wounds she didn‚Äôt want to show. One day I was robbed, nearly lost her number ‚Äî she barely reacted. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt message me, I won‚Äôt message you,‚Äù she said. Cold. Detached.

She talked about her cats. Her nephews with autism. How angry she got when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex. Her world was layered in emotion, but most of it was kept behind glass.

I invited her to the movies ‚Äî she always said we never did anything. She hesitated. Said she was embarrassed. The next day she asked, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be better if we were just friends?‚Äù I was confused. Still, we went. We kissed during the film. Laughed. For a moment, we felt like a real couple.

But there were always lines I couldn‚Äôt cross. She kept her phone close, never let me see it. Only gave me her Instagram after we broke up. One time, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up in a motel. She asked me not to turn on the lights. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shy,‚Äù she whispered. When I said it was fine, her mood changed instantly ‚Äî as if I‚Äôd broken an invisible rule.

Even when I walked her home, it felt like I was trespassing. She didn‚Äôt want me near her family. When her sister dropped her at my place once, I said something like, ‚ÄúWe never go out because you‚Äôre always making excuses.‚Äù She got furious.

There were so many little fights. I joked about a game she liked ‚Äî she stopped playing. She brought me sweets, then hours later said maybe we should break up. She invited me to a party, canceled, then changed her mind again. I asked if she even wanted me there. ‚ÄúJust come at 6,‚Äù she said, firmly. I showed up early. Her sister saw me, invited me in. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend. Then, out of nowhere, she said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs download a dating app to find you a hot girl.‚Äù I laughed ‚Äî but inside, I didn‚Äôt know what we were anymore.

She wanted me to sleep over. I didn‚Äôt. I was drained. Eventually, I called her and ended it. She cried. Blocked me. Later, she said I‚Äôd ruined her life. That I sent her to therapy. That I took away her happiness. But then ‚Äî she texted, said she missed me more than she expected.

We started talking again. I found her on a dating app. She said it was for a friend‚Äôs ex. I didn‚Äôt believe her. Told her I still loved her. She said she wished I had been with her somewhere she had gone. Then came the invite to her mom‚Äôs birthday. I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom called me later, asked if I loved her. Invited me for coffee.

We tried again. She said her dad hated me now. I broke down online, just to let it out. She saw it. Told me I had used her. That her insecurities came from being autistic. That she prayed for me. Then she vanished. Blocked me. Gone.

But I still remember the last time I saw her. She showed up with two chocolates in her hand. We sat down, watched a movie like nothing had ever gone wrong. Just a few hours later, she looked at me and asked:

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be better if we broke up?‚Äù

My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day and you put the rules on the lock screen of your phone.

Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined. Try the first 3 classes for free by getting the trail period and see for yourself.

What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:

1. Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.
2. If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).

\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.

3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.

4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.

5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.

As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the legendary Walk of Fame for the City of Los Angeles and has proudly hosted the globally iconic star ceremonies for decades. Millions of people from here and around the world have visited this cultural landmark since 1960.  



ABOUT OUR HONOREE



‚ÄúThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is honored to welcome Green Day‚Äôs Billlie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tr√© Cool to the Hollywood Walk of Fame,"" stated Ana Martinez, Walk of Fame Producer. ""Green Day's music has not only inspired generations but also served as the soundtrack to our lives. Honoring them with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a token of our appreciation for their incredible contributions to the world of music,"" Added Martinez



Formed in 1986 in Berkeley, California, Green Day is one of the world‚Äôs best-selling bands of all time with more than 75 million records sold worldwide and 10 billion cumulative audio/visual streams. The five-time Grammy Award-winning Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees released their breakout album Dookie in 1994 which sold over 10 million copies and achieved 10x Platinum Diamond status. Dookie is widely credited with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock, thus catapulting a career-long run of #1 hit singles. Entertainment Weekly calls Green Day ‚ÄúThe most influential band of their generation,‚Äù while Rolling Stone attests, ‚ÄúGreen Day have inspired more young bands to start than any act this side of Kiss, and that doesn't seem to be changing.‚Äù



In 2004, Green Day released the rock opera American Idiot which captured the nation‚Äôs attention, selling more than 8 million copies in the U.S. alone and taking home the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway to critical and commercial acclaim.



Released in 2020, Green Day‚Äôs thirteenth studio album Father of All... debuted at #1 on Billboard‚Äôs Album Sales Chart and #1 in both the U.K. and Australia. In July 2021, Green Day embarked on the Hella Mega Tour (w/ Fall Out Boy & Weezer). The global tour included 29 sold-out stadium gigs ‚Äì including renowned venues like London Stadium and Los Angeles‚Äô Dodger Stadium.



On January 19, 2024, the band released their highly anticipated 14th studio album, Saviors, which includes hit singles ‚ÄúThe American Dream Is Killing Me,‚Äù which reached #1 on Billboard Rock & Alternative Airplay, and ‚ÄúDilemma.‚Äù The album debuted at #1 on seven different Billboard charts and marked their fifth #1 in the U.K. Saviors received widespread critical praise. The New Yorker summed it up best with ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Green Day‚Äôs world now.‚Äù In 2024, Green Day embarked on a sold-out global stadium tour ‚Äì The Saviors Tour ‚Äì where they played Dookie and American Idiot in their entirety, along with other Saviors cuts and fan favorites. The Saviors Tour came to a triumphant close as Green Day‚Äôs biggest tour of their illustrious 30+ year career.



Last but not least, the band just performed for over 200,000 people at this year‚Äôs Coachella, headlining both Saturday nights.



Green Day supports several charities, including Project Chimps and Altadena Girls Fire Recovery. The band performed at the January 30th FireAid benefit concert and participated in fundraising efforts. They are also the owners of Punk Bunny Coffee, whose proceeds benefit various non-profit organizations.

What came up was how beautiful a person my ex is.
My dad molested me as a toddler and it made me feel safe and yet sharply painful.
I don't wanna to be above anyone knowing what happened to my mom. I want to lift everyone above me. And that is tied to why I feel alone.
I want a relationship where we turn each other's hurt into healing. We respect, respond and sooth and talk through things. I want to be and with The Star personified.

I feel connection with ex rn. The deep love I have for her. It was the first thing that came up. I cried through the whole session and it felt good to cry.

I don't want to be above anyone. I hate the idea of having power over someone. I guess that too is why having power sexually makes me feel intimate. It's contradictory.

I feel extremely relaxed but God. I miss her. Being in her regard is like the first sip of coffee. I wish I could send her the energy I feel rn. I have nothing but love in my heart for her.

In the tangle of things she really is like that moment she described of find those queen of the night blooming on that tree. A person I will never hold again. I had a deep connection with you. It wasn't just a one off. It wasn't usury. It wasn't you or me in service to you or you to me. It was love at it's core.

It is always nice to make space for you. Like making a faery garden, or a cat house. You're a joy. I wish you'd understand that both can be true. I was drained and yet you were never too much. I would bleed for you and I bled myself dry. I was scared and yet you were the absolute of comfort.

Both are true. At least for me. I'm sorry working on our relationship felt like it'd be too hard on you or whatever reason it made you unhappy. It's hard to have grief really. It was a rare sight, you in my bed in the morning, beautiful as could be. But you are too scared to see the good. The bad is the truth.

Because I love and understand I won't chase you anymore. It won't do you any good. I will love and experience loss.

I hope you have a nice day. My next appointment is Friday and if it is anything like this it is exactly what I needed to get where my path is leading. Space. Time slowed. Tranquility. Acceptance. Surrender. Healing.

I felt myself as the star. It has been my goal for so long. Now I am Temperance but I seek deeper things. I'm in awe of the shifts in my brain. Peace.",1,1746036885.0,u_whiteday__arsenal,0,1.0,False
1kbnbp9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbnbp9,Can I put regular coffee grounds in a Philips 1200?,"So my question is. Can I use REGULAR non espresso coffee grounds in the bean tray of a Philips 1200? 

The reason I ask, is because I did it since I bought the machine new. Problem is, the coffee came out suuuper watery, reddish and definitely not black. 

I removed the regular coffee grounds, pre grinded them on my grinder and placed it in the chute, and the coffee came out black, AND the disposed coffee came out in a nice solid puck.

The espresso beans and the regular coffee produce a sandy broken up clump in the dump tray

So is the top part ONLY for espresso beans? Could it be regular coffee doesn‚Äôt dispense and grind enough to actually make black coffee? ",0,1746036828.0,superautomatic,8,0.5,False
