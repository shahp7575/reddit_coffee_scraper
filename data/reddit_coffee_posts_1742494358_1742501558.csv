I physically cringe and literally need to cover my ears when someone scratches their nails along this specific type of surface. Think of a smooth, hard surface, but not at all glossy or squeaky (those are completely fine for me) and no texture. 
I've mostly encountered specific table surfaces of this type, or honestly even the back flap of my dell laptop (specifically my laptop's model, I've touched much better laptop surfaces). 
I guess the best wording I have is a very ""soft"" hard surface, like if you gently brushed your hand against it, it'd make a ""soft"" sound. But I can also think of surface textures that match my description but are not what I mean.

Maybe as a starting point, think of the texture of a fingernail bed, although that wouldn't bother me at all because it's much too soft.

The best example I have is IKEA furniture. Like the bedframes and the coffee tables and desks and everything, think of their plain white basic furniture's texture. That hard, non-textured, ""soft"" feeling. I have several pieces throughout my house so I know for a fact that these are triggering.

But anyway if anything scratches against this, my ears cannot handle it. Like I have to clench my teeth and if it's too much then I cover my ears.

She said she was open but unlikely to change her mind. Told her I‚Äôm not hear to convince anyone, her choice if she wants to meet just send me time you‚Äôre free.

Met up, she had the usual confused feelings. I went in with the mindset of I don‚Äôt care and was very straightforward, telling her this is just casual/fun/getting to know each other for now and we barely know each other. She made some comment about not wanting to hurt me I played it off, also made the point again it‚Äôs her decision. Ended up making out and then left.

That's not even considering the remaining SLOG if you wanted to go to say the Airfield, or Concentrator. And really there is nothing along the way, even with respect to scenery, you spend much time in a tunnel or canyon.

Does anyone else think this is excessive? I would rather climb 10 ropes in a row than walk through boring territory with little wildlife.

I hope you are having a great day and are enjoying some good espresso. I recently got a new Breville Barista Express and have spent some time trying to learn the basics and refining my process. I‚Äôm now on my second bag of coffee so im still kind of green.

Today I extracted a double shot of espresso that I thought looked great but tasted off. I still struggle with understanding if my coffee tastes sour or bitter but I would describe the taste as sour. Definitely not the sweet taste described on the packaging.

Some details about my process. I used Verve Sermon Medium roast coffee roasted on March 4th. I weighed out a dose of 18 grams for a double shot, tamped it evenly and used the razor to dial in the puck.

Dose: 18g

Grind Size: 6 (outer) 5 (inner burr)

Extraction Time: 29.5s (timed from button press. 10s before coffee dripped)

Yield: 37g

Temperature: 200 (stock?)

The crema had a great color and the flow seemed to have the ‚Äúhoney like‚Äù flow described in the owners manual. I let the machine warm up for about 30 minutes before pulling this shot.

I‚Äôve tried to grind at sizes 5 and 7 which also didn‚Äôt produce the results I was looking for. With 5 the extraction produced very little yield and the pressure seemed too high. With 7 the yield was too high for a 1:2 and the pressure was near the bottom end of the gray zone.

I would love to hear any opinions on how I might be able to improve my shots. My next thought would be to adjust the inner burr, manually program or use hotter water. In my process I‚Äôve been timing from button press but perhaps I should time from first drip.

My wife and I married 14 years. She's 44 I'm 54. My wife is gorgeous. She is  is stunning. I am a decent looking man and I'm extremely athletically fit. We have 2 daughters 13 and 7. A few months ago my wife called me up and said she wanted a seperation. She thought it would be mutual. She missed passion in her life and didn't see me in that way. Though she loved me dearly, she was not in love with me, had no desire for me. Did not want to kiss with me, felt nothing, etc.. It was a total terrible surprise, the worst pain I have ever felt, we had no talks prior about 'we should work on some things' The next day I wound up in the ER with my first Panic attack. In retrospect We focussed on the kids and forgot to focus on our relationship.. kids in the bed for the past 13 years.. not spending time together alone, not feeding our own relationship, not talking, not sharing, doing fun things, dating, etc.. we grew distant, sex was often an issue. We both feel like we really screwed up. Since then, our relationship has completely changed. We did not seperate. We have a nice life. We are very co-dependent. Seperation would be extremely hard and financially very difficult, and would up end our kids lives. We live without family support and it is a very careful balancing act to get things to work.. Our relationship has changed completely.. We both agree on that. We kicked the kids out of the bed. We wake up and go to sleep together, We touch, we hold each other, we do have sex sometimes spontaneously sometimes intentionally @ 2x per week. We now go on dates 1,2 times a week, I wake up and make my wife coffee. Before she would be in charge of the kids stuff in the morning which is a lot.. 5:30am bus, lunches, breakfast, other kid to school, plus her getting ready for work.. I took over all the kids morning stuff. We talk endlessly now.. A lot. We text, we make plans, on the weekends I used to work or do house/garden projects but now I dedicate the weekend to family and us. My number one goal is to improve our relationship. She is also committed and trying hard. We love each other deeply. I got a professional massage table and I give her professional level Massages and Hot Stone full body massages 2-3 times a week. My love language is touch and she Loves getting massaged. We are extremely nice and respectful with each other especially compared to in the past. We deeply love each other.. Our relationship is completely different than it was for the past many years. The result of this has been that while we are both much closer with each other, I have fallen completely madly back in love with my wife. I see her differently. I crave her, I want her, I desire her, I am 100% in love with her.. But.. here is our issue. She is much happier, much closer, with me, everything is improving, she does flirt with me, sometimes we do have spontaneous sex, but.... she says she still has no desire or attraction or passion towards me.. She is seeing a therapist who explained to her that she has 'companionate love' for me while I have 'consummate love' for her.. and that the passion may never come back.. So our question becomes, 'is this kind of love discrepency sustainable in marriage?' 'is there a way to improve, increase, or rekindle passion between us?' or if not 'what does our relationship regarding Sex and Sensual intimacy look like when one person is not really interested but wants to remain in the relationship' 'how do I deal with this rejection/inability to truly fulfill my wifes needs' 'how I do I deal with my own needs possibly never being met?' For example.. my wife cannot kiss me.. we can have sex, oral sex, but she can't kiss me and I want her kiss so badly.. we love each other. we want to have a future together to stay together both for us and also for our family.

AITA for telling my cousin the truth about her husband?,"Huge fan! I watch your videos, Charlotte, to make me laugh, escape from life, and so much more.

Ready for some nasty tea? Buckle up‚Äîthis one's a long one.

I‚Äôm not close with any of my cousins. I‚Äôve tried, but it never works out. I‚Äôve even reached out multiple times to hang out, but nothing ever comes of it. For context, I‚Äôm 35 (F), and my cousin is 40 (F). She‚Äôs married with a kid, but I‚Äôve never met her husband or child‚Äîso that‚Äôs already something. Let‚Äôs call my cousin 40 and her husband SOB (you know what that spells, right?). He‚Äôs also 40.

She lives in a city about an hour away from me. We rarely see each other, and when we do, she‚Äôs never with her husband. It‚Äôs always just her because we only cross paths at our grandma‚Äôs house.

One night, I went out with my friends and met this really cute guy. I was hooked. We spent every waking moment together‚Äîit felt like a dream come true.

My parents met him and loved him. My brother? Not so much. He said I could do better. But I didn‚Äôt care. Since we both worked, we only saw each other on weekends.

Fast forward six months, and things were getting serious. I was spending more time with him, not just on weekends. We hung out with his friends, and he spent time with mine. Everything felt right.

Then, one night, he came over, absolutely fuming. He ranted about a female coworker who kept hitting on him. He made it clear he was happy with me and wanted her to stop. I felt relieved‚Äîhappy, even‚Äîbecause I wasn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôd stand up for me like that.

Little did I know‚Ä¶ that ‚Äúcoworker‚Äù wasn‚Äôt really his coworker.

He invited me to his work event, and guess who was there? That so-called coworker.

She walked right up to me and said I stole her man. Turns out, they had been dating too‚Äîand the night we met was the same night he supposedly broke things off with her. Or something like that.

Anyway, we talked, and I told her that if she wanted to have a conversation with him, I was totally fine with it. At the end of the day, us girls should stick together. If something is bothering us, we should address it. She appreciated that, so we all sat down for a chat.

He explained their issues and her problems, and honestly, for a moment, I felt like their therapist.

Fast forward a month later.

My mom told me we were invited to my cousin‚Äôs wedding‚Äîanother cousin, apparently. I have so many cousins, I‚Äôve lost count. But sure, we were going.

I called him to be my date, but he said he couldn‚Äôt make it‚Äîhe had a prior commitment. 

I was a little disappointed because I wanted to show off‚Äîto let everyone know I had a successful boyfriend and that I was doing well for myself.

Remember Cousin 40 from the beginning of this thread? She was there too, with her family.

She found me sitting with my mom and asked me to come meet them. As I walked with her, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a little down. I had really wanted my boyfriend to be there with me‚Äîto celebrate together, dance, clap, and maybe even catch the flying bouquet.

As we approached, Cousin 40 tapped a man's shoulder. He turned around‚Äîand guess what?

His eyes nearly popped out of his head, and his mouth hung so wide open, flies could‚Äôve built a nest in there.

Yup. SOB.

Her husband.

The same man who cheated on her with his ""coworker.""

The same man who was supposedly MY BOYFRIEND!!!

The moment our eyes met, I played it cool. I shook his hand and walked away before he could even get a word out.

For privacy reasons, I can‚Äôt share the exact messages, but here‚Äôs a paraphrase of what went down:

**SOB:** I can‚Äôt believe you followed me here.

**Me:** Are you high? Followed you?! You‚Äôre the one who lied about being married. YOU ARE MARRIED! And to my cousin, no less. You backstabbing, lying, cheating piece of dog shit!

**SOB:** I wasn‚Äôt married when I met you.

**Me:** Hahahaha! Oh, really? That‚Äôs the card you‚Äôre playing? You‚Äôre lucky I didn‚Äôt tell her on the spot. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre married to my cousin‚Äîshe deserves so much better!

**SOB:** Stop talking like that. I did you a favor. No one was interested in you, and I gave you a chance.

**Me:** Say another word, and I‚Äôll expose you for the asshole you are.

**SOB:** Expose me? Honey, I‚Äôll tell her you‚Äôre a stalker.

**Me:** Oh, that‚Äôs how you wanna play it? Fine.

After that, I went straight to my mom and told her everything. She was livid. She wanted to confront him right then and there.

So, we asked to speak with Cousin 40 privately. Once we were alone, my mom and I spilled all the nasty tea about her precious SOB‚Äîevery dirty thing he had done behind her back.

She stared me dead in the eyes‚Äîthen slapped me across the face, calling me every name in the book.

My mom and I were stunned. My face burned from the hit, but before I could even react, my mom snapped yelling at her to shut the fuck up and smell the coffee‚Äîyour husband is a cheater! 

And get this‚Ä¶

She already knew. She had been following us. She had seen us together. She knew he was cheating‚Äîwith me.

I was baffled. Livid.

I turned to my mom and said I needed to get out of there and we did. We left the wedding ceremony apologizing to the rest of the family about us leaving. 

One cold Sunday morning, Cousin 40 called me. She apologized.

I didn‚Äôt even bother responding.

My mom answered instead and told her to leave us alone‚Äîwhatever she decided to do with SOB was her choice, but I wanted nothing to do with it.

And just like that, I never spoke to her again, because that was some next-level Jedi mind-trick manipulative bullshit, and I wanted no part of it.

Me: ""I'm a girl...""

As an AuDHD person who has constantly thrown herself in uncomfortable situations and learned everything the hard way (I had no real guidance from my parents) I think I‚Äôve finally got this life thing figured out. I have been thinking about what messages I want to get to my daughters while they are young. I‚Äôve been trying to think of things I would go back in time and tell myself as a little one to see how I could have turned out. Anyway, These are simply my do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs. A guide to having happiness I suppose. I‚Äôve been binging THT, now FKS and started MM, MWM? lol anyway I love YALL so much. I‚Äôm from Shreveport, LA so I doubt you‚Äôll be coming down here any time. Maybe DALLAS?! Come on! Ok here goes.

DO: 
‚Ä¢Meditate. I haven‚Äôt mastered it yet but EVERYTHING points to that being the solution to the problems I‚Äôve faced after 5 years of life in recovery. ‚Ä¢Yoga too.
‚Ä¢Start building your credit as soon as possible you‚Äôll have perfect credit within 3 years of you do it responsibly.
Life insurance policies. You can borrow against it. 
‚Ä¢Music festivals, dancing, wanderlust, hiking.
‚Ä¢Have very few, but very close relationships with people.
‚Ä¢Coffee/brunch dates or hosting dinner parties.
‚Ä¢Etiquette.
‚Ä¢Friends & family. They are the only constant but you only get to keep the friends you are good to.
Their life expectancy quite possibly is way less than you expect. Cherish every day with them and make videos. You will thank yourself if something happens and you have them to look back on. 
Listen to your gut. If someone shows you who they are, believe them. They are that person, not the person you‚Äôve created them to possibly be in the future.
‚Ä¢Get out of your comfort zone. That‚Äôs the only place growth comes from. 
‚Ä¢Find a job you can find a rhythm with. If you‚Äôre like me and struggle with the reality of social slavery, you‚Äôre likely battling the urge to quit all the time. If you find something you can dissociate and mindlessly do while you listen to a podcast. Maybe ‚ÄúTwo Hot Takes‚Äù or ‚ÄúSmosh‚Äù for those of you who don‚Äôt know which one to listen to and have only found duds (there‚Äôs a lot)
‚Ä¢Quality over quantity. Especially with clothing. This doesn‚Äôt mean buy luxury brands. This means check the fabric and stitching. When you are trying it on, ask yourself, ‚Äúis it comfortable?‚Äù‚ÄúDoes this garment feel like it was made for me? ‚ÄúDoes it spark joy?‚Äù If the answers to those questions are no, let it go. This goes with everything. I get that, about holiday decor, for example, not all of them. necessarily have to spark joy independently because all decorations are beautiful to someone. But your sheets? Yes.
‚Ä¢Find yourself a getaway place.
>If you feel anger you cannot control, go sit by a body of water or on the rooftop of a tall building, wherever your ‚Äúgetaway place‚Äù is. You‚Äôll only regret lashing out on loved ones. 
‚Ä¢Literally just be a good human being. 
The 10 commandments basically covers it but I would like to add, ‚Äúrespect other people‚Äôs personalities, choices, views, religions and lifestyles.‚Äù I have noticed so many people cling to hate when they could be actively trying to better their community instead. I feel like if everyone just chose to mind their own business more there wouldn‚Äôt be such division. 
‚Ä¢Answer the call. You never know when someone might really need you. Mental health needs to be taken more seriously.
‚Ä¢Shop local! 
Listen to others when they speak. If you want to be heard when you say that thing you‚Äôve obviously been waiting to say the entire time the other person was speaking, at least try to make it seem like you are.
Brush your teeth. You. Will. Lose. Them. Faster than you‚Äôd imagine. 
Save and protect your virginity. It is sacred. I lost mine to some old loser I‚Äôve never seen again but I heard he told everyone I must have not been a virgin because I didn‚Äôt bleed üòë
‚Ä¢Discipline your children and set boundaries BEFORE the cute squishy baby part is over. You will pay for it later if you cave to their cute little FAKE cries.
‚Ä¢Process your emotions. If something painful comes up or something negative happens to you, feel it. Allow yourself to grieve when necessary because the grieving process is happening whether you want it to or not. You can choose to keep yourself in one.l stage forever if you don‚Äôt process it as it comes. 
‚Ä¢Find your strain.
‚Ä¢Embrace aging. As a 36yo woman 

DONT:
Yuck someone‚Äôs yum, road rage, impatience, fighting, sore losing, revenge, hate and intolerance, party every night, say ugly things, or leave the house unkempt, or be a ‚Äúsneaky link‚Äù
‚Ä¢Worry. It won‚Äôt do a single thing to help the issue. Stress exists to push us. If you feel stressed there is probably something you‚Äôre procrastinating. 
‚Ä¢Procrastinate. You have to do the thing either way. If you put it off you will feel stress every time you think of the thing you have to do. Save yourself ALOT of stress you can avoid by simply doing it. 
Fear. Stress is natural, fear is something that must be faced head on.
‚Ä¢Keeping score. If you‚Äôre keeping score the game is already over. -Jerry
Bonus: every time you complete a task you get a lil hit of dopamine‚ú® 
‚Ä¢Do hard drugs. because trust me, I‚Äôve tried to do them in a manageable way and it‚Äôs literally impossible.
‚Ä¢Yell. It‚Äôs totally unnecessary and does WAY more harm than good.
‚Ä¢Hide things
‚Ä¢Seek reassurance outside yourself. It will always fail at some point. If you need a partner to validate you, you‚Äôre not ready for a relationship. If you are not positive you could entertain yourself for the rest of your life, by yourself, you‚Äôre not ready. 
‚Ä¢Date someone who hides you from the world. This. Is. Not. Love. 
‚Ä¢Let bad people close to you. If a person was steal from someone else, they will steal from you. If you gain a partner by stealing them from another, you lose them how you get them. You get what you give. Beauty is as beauty does. Pain is weakness leaving the body. What don‚Äôt kill you, makes you stronger. And if you see something, say something. I was always told being a snitch is the worst thing you can be, but I think there are far too many unsolved murders/crimes in this world.
* Ignore a child if they tell you they‚Äôre being abused. Nine times out of 10 they are telling the truth you‚Äôre just too afraid to admit it to yourself as the truth.

Blizz putting a new emphasis on Skins, Tower Skins, Kobold Skins, and possibly more cosmetics is extremely good to see. As capitalism tends to work, vote with your wallets. If you prefer cosmetics over pay-to-win power, BUY THEM.","**TL;DR- buy cosmetic content if you want the game to shift its monetization focus to** ***that*** **instead of pay to win. buy cosmetic content if you want to increase the likelihood that this game get more raids, leaders, factions, continents, zones, dungeons, and more in the future.**

As much as we'd like to believe that service games run on Sunshine, Daises, and the power of friendship- they don't. They're businesses. No different from how Arcade Machines that barely collected any coins would eventually be put out of comission in favour of the games that people liked more.

My point? I see many of you here staunchly refuse to pay for anything in this game, but then still very confusingly demand more content, more raids, leaders, continents, dungeons, etc. *You cannot have it both ways.* Either you spend your time on a game until its end and roll the dice on how long it can sustain thousands of other players like you, *OR* you use the same money that you'd otherwise spend on a coffee, burger, beer, whatever- to buy something you like, and know that your money isn't funding Bobby's yacht anymore and will most likely be re-invested back into this game.

I've done this song and dance before with HotS, with Legends of Runeterra, and others- it doesn't matter how fun the game is, or how many players it has. If it doesn't make money, they will in time, shut it down.

For so long we've seen the frustration among these forums that Pay-2-win monetization isn't the healthiest option for a game like this, and so after much asking, I'd like to think the Rumble team are expanding the options with more cosmetics, which are a monetization system that historically works best with service games. So? we're finally getting Leader and mini skins to complement the Kobold and Tower skins. This is huge for us. And it feels like the first 'shot' at really showing where the interest of player money is.

If you still think you're ""making a stand"" by not buying any microtransactions, I'd like to wake you up from your time capsule and remind you that microtransactions have been around since 2010. It's been 15 years. Your protest isn't changing anything besides ever so slightly increasing the likelihood that a game you play, dies. So yeah, never thought I'd find myself making a post like this, but after having spent time in 2 other great games, only to have them both be shifted to maintenance mode, this is the elephant in the room that needs to be said. I'd rather not Rumble end up like that, and would much prefer it last years and years to come with an ever-growing mountain on content. Possibly some more crossovers with WoW in the future too.

Be the change you want to see in this world. If you want more raids, continents, and higher quality content instead of just NPC bosses recycled as units- ***buy some damn skins***.

I've got the Shopify website all set up (not live), but I feel like the main missing piece now is the credibility of this new website that basically competes with other boutique stores on a commodity product.

Which brings me to where I'm at now; my initial thoughts is that I need to have a bare minimum social media presence so that when people discover my site, they do their due diligence (check instagram, facebook, etc.) to make sure it is a legitimate storefront (my prices will be very competitive relative to the market) and that I'm not some fly by night scam shop trying to take their money.

As a non-social media expert, in my mind I feel like getting the first 100 followers is going to be the biggest uphill battle, and therefore I should focus most of my efforts there. Most of my ideas have revolved around giveaways. Happy to give away stuff but also want it to get the right level of reach, so I'm unsure on how to do this.

Some giveaway thoughts:

* I have a friend who runs a cutesy coffee shop; I could send her 150 units of my product (MSRP $15, cost to me $2) and have her do a social media post letting her customers know that if they follow my page (and make a purchase in her store?) they can have a free product of mine.
* Doing bigger giveaways ($100 MSRP) weekly and requiring people to like/share/follow to enter. Not sure how to go about doing this without any followers, would I need to run some kind of Instagram ad?
* Selling at a loss/suboptimally via eBay and other established channels and giving away stickers or something with my social media handle on it, which would hopefully steer them to my site where prices would be lower and I make more. (this option feels slow)

I have friends that would be happy to ""run the social media account"" once we're up and running, but my main priority right now is just getting the shop live and making sales, so in my mind I just need 100 followers and anything that happens past that is a bonus. appreciate any feedback you may have.",1,1742499910.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

I work out 3 days a week for 2 hours, I eat healthy, my bloodwork is nearly perfect, my blood pressure is excellent. I am made up of a lot of muscle and I'm healthy, but my BMI is what matters.

I started my period when I was 10 years old. I was in middle school bleeding through my pants at theme parks with my friends because my tampons couldn't hold the amount of blood I had coming out.

I am now 37, childless, still in pain, still exhausted and still devastated. I have been trying to get this surgery since I was in my early 20's. No one would listen to me. I finally found someone who said ""we'll get down to the bottom of your pain"" only to have another entity come between me and relief once again. 

  
I cried for hours today. My mom took off work, calmed me down and scooped me up to get coffee and go to Sephora. My family is still taking time off work on the day I was supposed to have the surgery so we all can go do something together and I can take my mind off of it. The people at my work have been so supportive and they are heart broken for me. I am so blessed with such an amazing support system and an awesome community of people who know exactly what I am going through.

My partner and I are planning a move to Dallas this summer, and we‚Äôre starting to feel both excited and overwhelmed. We‚Äôve visited a couple times, but actually making the move feels like a whole different adventure.

A little about us:

* We‚Äôre in our early 30s, work remotely, and love walkable areas with good coffee shops, parks, and local food spots.
* Budget for rent is around $2,500/month, ideally for a 2-bedroom apartment or rental home.
* We‚Äôll have one car but would love to be in an area where we *don‚Äôt* need to drive for everything.

Questions for y‚Äôall:

1. Which neighborhoods would you recommend for young professionals who want a mix of city life and chill vibes?
2. How‚Äôs the rental market right now? Should we start looking super early?
3. Any ‚ÄúI wish I knew this before moving to Dallas‚Äù tips?

I see a lot of requests for advice about sleep training or advice about talking to our partners who are opposed to sleep training.

My advice? Don't. 

With our first son 8 years ago I was there, exhausted all the time, and wanting to sleep train. It was a fairly brief conversation about how we wouldn't be doing that. With our second, same thing. With our third I embraced the suck and powered through. Now all three of my kids are sleeping through the night and I am really good at functioning on little sleep.

Two or three nights per week after everyone is asleep, I go out and ride mountain bikes in the woods with some guys and have a few beers. I get home late, get cleaned up, sometimes have a few more, prep the coffee maker, prep some waffle batter for breakfast if it's the weekend. 

I get 3-5 hours of sleep, but instead of being up varying hours trying to soothe a little one I spend some quality time getting some exercise and doing what I love. I wake up stoked.

Use the exhaustion of not sleep training to train yourself and sleep when you're dead.

TL/DR: 
1. Cum in your partner 
2. Don't sleep train 
3. Ride mountain bikes and have beers with your friends

1jfxecl,https://www.reddit.com/r/traderjoes/comments/1jfxecl/vanilla_bean_jojos_are_gone_and_i_am_crumbled/,Vanilla Bean JoJo‚Äôs are gone and I am crumbled.,"My very favorite cookie is the Vanilla Bean Jojo‚Äôs (yellow cookie with vanilla bean filling) and I would rarely allow myself to get them because I will literally eat the entire box in a day. I had WLS back in 2020 so I avoided them. 

I rarely get to go to TJ, it‚Äôs across town the opposite way from where I live and I don‚Äôt get over there but every year or two. Today I had a pre surgery appointment right by there, so I decided to treat myself. Much to my dismay, I discovered they have been discontinued with no current date of return if ever. I was so crushed. It‚Äôs dumb to place such a desire over a product, I know but I was having a rough morning (upcoming knee replacement and wanted a pick me up) so it hit me hard. 

They do have a ‚Äúcinnamon bun inspired‚Äù jojo, and the chocolate ones are there but that isn‚Äôt the same. I did get the cinnamon ones to try and they are quite good. They taste just like the vanilla bean ones but with cinnamon added, so all is not lost. I did realize the filling is a lot skimpier than the original ones, so that‚Äôs also disappointing but with the way things are that‚Äôs not surprising. 

Long story longer, if you were also a fan of the vanilla bean jojo‚Äôs, give the cinnamon bun ones a try if your store has them. Not exactly the same but it scratched the itch a bit and helped put a bandaid on the bullet wound that is my loss for the original ones. :) 

I got a couple of other cookies to try and here are my thoughts after trying them:

All butter shortbread sandwich cookies w raspberry filling, 9/10: so good, tastes like a Jammie Dodger or a Pepperidge Farm Verona but way better. 

Crispy Oatmeal Cookies: Oh wow. If you‚Äôre a fan of that crunchy oatmeal flavor, these are a 10/10. Small, crisp and buttery, they are an instant favorite in our house. 

I also bought the Italian chocolate eggs from the Easter candy and they were very good. 7/10. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the milk chocolate flavor, it tasted a little grainy but it might just be me. However the coffee, dark chocolate and hazelnut ones were delicious. The shell is about twice as thick as say an M&M or other candy shell options, and the chocolate inside is very rich and delicious. They are a tad on the pricy side at $10 a box, but the presentation was nice and I like the variety of colors and hues. 

Have a great day!

I keep running into an issue where I‚Äôm speaking to family members at the end of the day ish, and nothing I do seems right. After a long day, I ask about work/their tasks, and if they don‚Äôt seem to want to talk, I ask an adjacent question so that if they do end up wanting to talk they can easily tie it back, but the question itself is simple (e.g. if I‚Äôm speaking to a relative who is a teacher, I ask, is students not bringing in stationary a big issue? It can easily be answered with a yes or no but can also be expanded upon). 

But if the adjacent question doesn‚Äôt work and they don‚Äôt vent about anything or tell me about their day, I often tell them lighthearted news about my day‚Äî nothing braggy, but something good that happened to me today. I made myself an iced coffee! I read some of my book! And then if they don‚Äôt seem detached I expand, tell them why I made a coffee or what my book was about. The aim is to keep the conversation about something they could engage on‚Äî like if it was a teacher, I‚Äôd talk about how it might tie into subjects they teach. It‚Äôs probably because I talk a lot, but most people don‚Äôt respond to me really. Lots of ‚Äòokay‚Äôs and stuff. So usually at this point I make an excuse and leave.

But! But, here‚Äôs the actual problem. Obviously, the person in the example above doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. Which is fine! But then, every time, if I stop the conversation after the normal pleasantries and leave, they get upset because I‚Äôm not talking to them. Which is why I keep going! 

I‚Äôm sooo confused every time. They want to talk to me but I try to steer the conversation to them, to me, to positive things, to common topics, to something they want to vent about, and nothing works! But if I don‚Äôt talk to them, they still seem upset!

1jfxbfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jfxbfj/caffeine_is_so_easy_to_quiti_will_give_you_the/,caffeine is so easy to quit...I will give you the secret.,"now for your average muggle it's hard to quit only because they are a victim of the church of science and don't realize the world is 100 percent magic and that anything is possible and suffering is only an illusion of the mind.

first off you gotta realize there is no past. you didn't have coffee X number of hours ago, you only have the thought that you had coffee in the past. and you're assuming the reliability of that thought. why? because you want to. but once you realize it's just a thought and that you never actually drank coffee in the past because there is no past and that linear time is just a cultural construct created through conceptual abstraction, then you can skip the whole withdrawal thing. see, if you believe the past is real then you proliferate the fear that you will go through a withdrawal and then you manifest that very reality you fear and feel like shit. but if you see through the game then you're immune to such nonsense self deception. the fear will vanish and you will manifest only bliss and sobriety is the most potent drug you have ever taken.

which brings me to the second important point. realize that you are not made of matter. you are not a physical being made of flesh with a brain and nervous system. that is all conceptual indoctrination by the church of science the most popular religion of the modern industrial global culture. no instead realize you are a divine being of light. this is easy to see if you take a large enough dose of magic mushrooms or meditate for long enough getting high on sobriety and in touch with reality but whichever path you want to take you're going to recognize the inevitable truth that there is only light. so your body and your mind are really one. you've never actually seen your brain or your nervous system this is just a construct of thought which you have accepted as real because culture told you what to believe and you accepted it. which then manifests a whole reality that confirms your bias towards nature and now you think it's hard to quit caffeine.

I'm telling you it's as easy as your mind believes it is. remember there is no spoon and the mind makes it real. so once you see that the whole science behind physical withdrawal from the substance is founded on a cultural myth then you are able to cheat the game and quit cold turkey without withdrawals and sleep peacefully as you drift off into a blissful sleep free from all neurosis. and don't do it slowly like a wussy because then you are just reinforcing the idea that it's hard to do which will manifest the very reality you dread. but if you do it fast that's because you know it's easy so there's no point doing it slowly.

of course you can keep drinking tea and coffee if you want there's nothing bad about it because once you realize everything I've just told you, then you realize you can be healthy with or without caffeine it's just a personal choice of what kind of life you want to experience. you are the entire universe experiencing itself as a monkey and you can create any reality you want.

now if you choose to disagree with me it's not because I'm wrong it's actually because you unconsciously want to play the science game and go through a terrible withdrawal and have it feel hard because that's the life game you want to play until you finally awaken from the illusion of Samsara and realize Nirvana the eternal bliss that is your true nature. that's perfectly fine to do of course but it's just a bit comical because you're playing a big trick on yourself taking life so serious that you make yourself suffer pointlessly. anyhow...I have given you the key it's up to you to unlock the door or not.",0,1742499000.0,decaf,16,0.39,False

I'm looking for friendships here only, hopefully ones that will be long-term. Hoping to make friends that I can do activities with, maybe travel, or simply just chill and hang out with.

A little about me: Life in San Francisco but open to meeting people around the Bay Area.

A lot of my hobbies are indoor things, like watching shows and video games. But for outdoor activities, I like to go hiking and biking, or long walks. I really want to get into tennis or pickleball, so would like a friend to play with. Maybe a gym buddy too. 

Also want to get into winter sports, particularly skiing. I'm open to trying any activities too, like board game nights, movie nights, escape rooms, things of that sort.

I enjoy going out to eat and trying new restaurants, coffee/boba shops. I occasionally enjoy going out for drinks and bar hopping. I don't smoke but don't mind if you do.

Hit me up if you're interested in becoming friends. Let's keep it strictly platonic.",1,1742498922.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My 11 week old dropped off from 25th to 5th percentile, gaining less than half an oz a day. We‚Äôre trying to top off, trying to replace nursing with formula where we can. He starts daycare Monday and I go back to work.

He‚Äôs miserable to wake up middle of the night to feed. 9 PM-4 AM he hates eating. He‚Äôs screaming at me every time I try. I pretty much stay awake trying to get him to feed until I sleep from 1-4 before I stay up the remainder of the day trying to feed him. I have to feed him every 3.5 hours at night, 2-3 daytime.

I‚Äôm fucking exhausted and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to go to work next week like this. They just said keep trying, try changing the diaper, try tickling, try handing off to dad. A lot harder to hand off to dad when my toddler is screaming for him.

Any advice or tips to stay awake? I have to enter information and can‚Äôt screw it up and I don‚Äôt think coffee will help much.",13,1742498893.0,workingmoms,25,1.0,False
1jfx9sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jfx9sb/not_sure_what_to_think_after_being_friendzoned/,Not sure what to think after being friendzoned,"This girl, ‚Äúellie‚Äù\[21F\], Im ‚Äú\[20M\], felt perfect. Not in the sense that she was everything I ever wanted im gonna marry her bla bla bla, just in the sense that we were two people who seemed to understand each other. Kind of like outcasts who found each other. For a little context we live in a cowboy type city and we are both punk/alt so that added to our kinship. I didn‚Äôt want to force a relationship so I ¬†was happy with just being friends and texting with her lots. We could both talk a lot because we had quite a bit in common. Eventually, after talking for about a month, she asked me out. We went for a coffee date and for me it went great. We ended up hanging out for around 4 hours, and she said she was excited to see me again. She flirted more in her texts, so I reciprocated. I kept getting told how I was a green flag and one of the few people she knew who had similar experiences as her. Because of mid terms and various family things, our second date got pushed off for a bit, but we never stopped texting each other every day. On our second date I asked her if I could take her out for dinner but she said she was tired and just wanted to come over to my house. This surprised me a bit but I had no problem with this. Unfortunately I got a bad headache so when she came over I don‚Äôt think I was as talkative as normal. She stayed for about 3-4 hours again, and everything seemed really good. When we were talking she asked what I wanted from ‚Äúthis‚Äù. She asked if I wanted a relationship or if I just wanted like a friends with benefits thing. I was a bit taken back but happy with her honesty. I told her a relationship. She said good, and that she just always has to be weary of people ‚Äútrying to get into her pants.‚Äù I walked her to her car, we hugged, and she said that she would see me atleast within a week. We both texted good night, and everything seemed good. A day went by where she didn‚Äôt text what I didn‚Äôt think much about. The next day she texted she was sorry she just had a headache. I was weary of this answer and asked if everything was ok. She texted back saying I didn‚Äôt do anything that bugged her and our date was great, but she thinks we should be friends. She said im amazing and she attracted to be and would like to be friends. I was pretty taken back at this just because, she was the one that seemed to be flirting the most with me. Its like a switch went off in a day that just completely changed her mind. I was especially surprised that it happened so suddenly after texting for probably 2-3 months everyday.

I later opened hinge (I hate online dating, it was actually an accident) but the first profile was her and all the picture were from pictures she sent me over our texts.

¬†

Iv gotten friend zoned before, broken up with, and far worse relationship situations, but for some reason this hurts so bad. I cant believe it. Its been a week now and I still cant stop thing about it. We weren‚Äôt even really boyfriend and girlfriend yet so I know it‚Äôs a bit silly. The worse part is I don‚Äôt understand why, if I said something, or she was losing interest it would be different, but not knowing is gonna kill me. Im not sure what I should do. I don‚Äôt want to be mad at her either, but I suppose I should be. Some friends have told me to keep texting her, and that if there was something there it will change. Im not sure about that tho.

u/SaltyBeachBabe108 **x2** for the sailboat postcard. I'm excited for the Betty White stamp! And this gorgeous mushroom postcard. It's really stunning. Thanks for these great cards! üß°

I think that's fantastic what you're doing with the Edition Tausendsch√∂n I've been sending you! I'm glad you've been enjoying them. I bought a few Easter ones to send you soon ... so surprise surprise about that! I wanna frame all my M&O ones and make a wall of locations maybe above my desk. And last but not least this BabyRaspberry postcard. I think I saw this first on Meta when PinkPengin maybe posted it in her Self-Care challenge entry. I like how the rainbow üåà pens üñäÔ∏è match the rainbow on the card. Yes, I am forced to go outside to constantly feed the birds and walk the dogs. Yesterday I swam in that pond behind my home because I threw the ball with the launcher too far into the center and the dogs didn't want to fetch it. So Mommy had to start swimming and then of course Bodhi decided to race me and got to the ball before I did. Oh the adventures I have outside everyday. Otherwise I would never leave the house. The Karen Read trial part 2 is starting soon and I will be inside watching all day long like I did the last trial. I wanna go to MA to protest the corruption in DA Michael Morrissey's office and their unconstitutional prosecution of her. I don't know that's about all. Glad you are doing so well. I hope you are enjoying your current adventure! üíñ

My friend we‚Äôll call her Linda, is 34 (f) and I found her at a mother fb group event and hit it off right away.

We set a play date and the morning of I sent a confirmation text to make sure nothing came up because mom life, she said still on but the next corresponding texts seemed like excuses as to why she can‚Äôt do a play date. Saying things like ‚Äú I have to stop by the store with the kids ugh and my child isn‚Äôt even awake yet.‚Äù So I said do you want to reschedule and that‚Äôs when the problems started.

Please don‚Äôt take any offense because I have really enjoyed spending time with you and your wonderful kids, I think you‚Äôre an amazing mom, but I haven‚Äôt particularly liked how some of our interactions have gone or how they continue to make me feel.

1) Their Role   
2) The store they work for

A user can work for many stores.  At each store they can have different roles and of course each role allow different permissions.  A role for instance might be a StoreOwner who can access financial records where a store assistant cant.  A store owner can own many stores.  A store assistant could also work for many stores ( and in some instances the store owner of a store may be a store assistant in other ).. you can see its a complicated multi part relationship.

Its easy to have roles and easy to define a user.  But what I'm struggling with is the relationship with the Store ( essentially just a location ).  Had assumed we use use administration units to set up a store list.  A role could be created, the user could exist and then we could have a combination of User + Store ( AU )  + Role.

We want to try and self contain this information in entra, i know we could use a 3rd party DB to store some rights and permissions and do a call out to this to get the extra claims information but trying to avoid that if at all possible.

1jfwywl,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jfwywl/meet_joe_black/,Meet Joe Black,"Hi everyone!

I just watched this movie, and it has officially become my number one favorite movie of all time. I‚Äôm pretty sure nothing else can top it!

Some of my personal favorite entertainment pieces are:

1.	‚Å†Meet Joe Black
2.	‚Å†Forgotten Love
3.	‚Å†All Spider-Man movies in sequence
4.	‚Å†Miracles from Heaven
5.	‚Å†Blood of Zeus: S2 E3 - Winter is Born
6.	‚Å†Me Before You
7.	‚Å†50 First Dates
8.	‚Å†Life is Beautiful
9.	‚Å†The Son

I‚Äôm planning to watch ‚ÄúThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button‚Äù as well!

I hope this list continues to grow with your suggestions!

Now, writing about what I eagerly want to express about this movie in the right place on the internet (Reddit). I absolutely love it!

I haven‚Äôt seen such a simple yet masterfully crafted movie in my life so far. Moments like:

‚Ä¢	When Bill explains to his daughter, Susan, how lightning will strike her life, and that‚Äôs when she‚Äôll know it‚Äôs love. He advises her to search for a man who makes her deliriously happy.

‚Ä¢	(Brad Pitt) The wonderful coffee shop scene where the charming young man (later revealed as the Coffee Shop Guy) smoothly flirts with Susan, leading to her saying, ‚ÄúI like you too much.‚Äù Then, suddenly, he dies in a tragic accident, leaving us in shock.

‚Ä¢	His sudden reappearance in front of Bill in the library‚Äîfirst as a reflection in the mirror, then fully stepping into the scene. This is the arrival of Mr. Joe Black, aka Death, in the physical form of the Coffee Shop Guy. The intense moment when Bill questions him by saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a kid in a suit, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Then, without exchanging words, he looks deeply into Joe‚Äôs eyes and realizes that Death has come for him.

‚Ä¢	Brad Pitt‚Äôs A-Class acting as Joe Black‚Äîhis first appearance in Bill‚Äôs library completely shifts the movie‚Äôs tone. At this point, we expect the Coffee Shop Guy to be dead, but if alive, he‚Äôd be a carefree, lighthearted person. Instead, Joe‚Äôs persona is calm, mysterious, and almost otherworldly.

‚Ä¢	The Peanut Butter Scene! Watching Joe learn how to eat with a spoon and experience human sensations for the first time was both hilarious and superbly acted by Brad.

‚Ä¢	(Claire Forlani) Susan‚Äôs eyes play a crucial role in this movie. They express emotions without words, making her one of the most expressive and beautiful actresses I have ever seen!

‚Ä¢	The way Joe gradually falls in love with Susan is simply adorable!

‚Ä¢	The interaction between Joe and the old lady from the islands in the hospital is both funny and profound. They start on a lighthearted note but end up discussing deep truths about life‚Äîhow some things are simply meant to happen and can‚Äôt be delayed. The old lady‚Äôs acceptance of fate and her hope to leave with a bag full of memories is touching. I especially loved how cutely Joe and the old lady interacted when she realized that he had fallen in love with the lady doctor. It was simply heartwarming!

‚Ä¢	Alison‚Äôs role is remarkable. She deeply understands her father‚Äôs love for her, even as she tirelessly prepares for his grand birthday party. Any child would want their parents to have such a celebration‚Äîit‚Äôs an expression of love! I could really relate to her character because my parents, too, don‚Äôt like celebrating their birthdays, but for me, their birthdays feel like a festival‚Äîan opportunity to express my love and gratitude. Despite knowing that Susan is her father‚Äôs favorite, Alison handles it with grace, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to have a favorite. Yours is Susan. And you‚Äôre my favorite one.‚Äù Such a heartfelt exchange!

‚Ä¢	(Anthony Hopkins) Bill‚Äôs acting is beyond phenomenal. His dialogue delivery, vocabulary, and presence are unmatched. His portrayal of a loving father feels so natural, and his confrontation with Death to protect his daughter is powerful. From the moment Susan was born to his very last breath, his love for her remains unwavering.

‚Ä¢	Joe‚Äôs transformation from Death to a man is beautifully portrayed. When Joe and Bill are in his office during the birthday party, Bill tells him, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission to be with my daughter, yet you came to inform me that you love her.‚Äù This moment marks a shift in Joe‚Äôs character‚Äîfrom an entity beyond human emotions to someone capable of love. This realization also leads Joe to understand that he must tell Susan the truth about his real identity and ultimately leave her.

‚Ä¢	The most heartwarming yet heartbreaking scene‚Äîthe final conversation between Joe and Susan at the party. Without exchanging words, their eyes convey everything. Joe deeply gazes into Susan‚Äôs eyes, knowing he can‚Äôt stay with her. In this moment, Susan looks into his eyes and finally understands that he is not the Coffee Shop Guy but Death itself. Yet, instead of shattering his heart, she softly says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Joe.‚Äù This was such a thoughtful and loving moment in the film‚Äôs writing!

‚Ä¢	Bill‚Äôs immense love for his daughters, Alison and Susan, is beautifully expressed. In his final speech, he is deeply grateful for everything he has received in life. His words hold such profound meaning.

‚Ä¢	One of the most powerful dialogues in the film comes when Bill stands beside Joe, acknowledging what he has done for Susan. He thanks Joe for making his daughter deliriously happy, as that was all he ever wanted for her. Then, in one of the most thoughtful exchanges: 
- Bill: ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt easy to leave, is it?‚Äù 
- Joe: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
- Bill: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs life.‚Äù
These simple yet profound words resonate deeply!

‚Ä¢	Finally, the ending‚Äîwhen Susan realizes that her father‚Äôs goodbye is truly his final farewell. By now, she has understood who Joe really is and that he has come to take her father away. She lets her father go, but moments later, she sees Joe return from the bridge‚Äîonly to realize that this is not Joe/Death, but the Coffee Shop Guy.

‚Ä¢	When they talk about their first meeting at the coffee shop, her eyes slowly reveal her realization. She corrects him, saying, ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòI liked you so much.‚Äô‚Äù

‚Ä¢	She even mentions that she wished he had met her father, further confirming that she knew Joe was indeed Death and that her father‚Äôs time had come.

‚Ä¢	In the end, she and the Coffee Shop Guy now have all the time in the world to truly get to know each other, leading to a bittersweet yet hopeful ending.

I do actually believe her though). The reason I believe her is because for the first 4 months after the break up we still lived together, and since the breakup in its entirety, she never moved on to anyone else and got into therapy (as did I) and we both made strides to actually work on ourselves.

FOR CONTEXT: We were together for 9 years since she was 19 and myself 24. We were each others 1st everything, and full transparency I was not emotionally mature, as I said this was my 1st ever real relationship where I felt love and loved her back, but after year 7 or so I started to get pretty complacent in the relationship, I didn't mean to do this, we had just grow amazingly comfortable with each other and I felt we found the one to be with (I do blame myself pretty heavily for letting this ruin what I (and she) thought was forever, but I am getting better, because it takes two to maintain, and two to destroy)) anyway she did communicate some needs that i felt (and this was way wrong of me) were not as important in a long term relationship where we had all the other things for a very strong, stable foundation. We were absolutely best friends, had a deep bond and connection where it was effortless to be ourselves around each other, we laughed constantly, were excited to see each other, things i feel like take a lifetime to find with someone. However the main issue we had was a lack of physical intimacy and not kissing or holding hands or cuddling, we had all of that, but physical sex was not happening often. She voiced this concern to me many times, and I would make an effort to do better, but she never really did, she would just blame me for not being constantly horny for her everyday (my libido isn't exactly high) this rubbed me the wrong way, but instead of telling her that i wanted her to initiate more and for us to have a balance of who engages, i just expected her to know this (again lesson learned) Anyway this issue grew into other poor communication on my part mostly because again, my 1st relationship, i didn't quite understand how to navigate this stuff, i was basically a recluse through my early 20s, not really needing to develop these skills. Anyway it became too much for her and she broke it off in August of 2024.

At first i was on board, this lasted 1 day and i was in shambles ever since. I did a lot to prove to her i have and can work on my communication skills (because ultimately this was the great divide, and rightfully so) we had numerous heart to hearts during those months after the break up where we still lived together, and I stepped up in the sex department and gave her everything she'd asked for (too little too late, and kind of mad her more annoyed that i would change now and not then, which i understand fully, it was certainly unfair) Anyway I was trying to prove to her that i could be all the things that i thought were less important in a long term relationship, because in my eyes we had everything I wanted. I fully understand how selfish this was and after looking objectively now know that things important to her in a relationship, even if i think they were less mature reasons (which they certainly aren't, but at the time i thought so), but if she found them important i should find them even more important, and that's my fault for not understanding that at the time.

Despite my very best efforts to win her over, she stuck to her guns. I moved out of the apartment we shared after trying to cling to it, but ultimately tried to do my best to respect her decision (it took me a while to do this because i felt so heartbroken and lost). I moved back in with my parents and we maintained contact (frowned upon. i know). I had all the hope in the world for months after breaking up that we could try again, after all we were together 9 years and had never once broke up, so I remained in contact (definitely too much). We met up multiple times and for the 3 months living separately only remained out of contact for like a month. By this time she had been talking about moving to another state for a job she asked for on a job conference. I was more depressed than before upon hearing this, but when she got back from ""seeing if she liked"" the new job, she invited me to dinner. I was excited and afraid because at this point i was doing everything to hang out with her and she wasn't really trying much. So when she asked to get food and talk i was overcome with hope. We get to the restaurant and she tells me all about her trip and that she IS NOT moving. I was overjoyed, but tried to hold in my excitement. I drive her home and spill my guts about how things can and will be different between us because of our extremely strong foundation (this is something i believe she would fully agree we have) and I took full accountability for my shortcomings without making excuses, I didn't beg her back or pressure her at this time, i just simply laid out all of my feelings i had about us (showing her my improved communication, not deliberately, but it certainly was a display nonetheless). She cried in the car and we had a long hug and said we should do it again sometime. I was so happy to hear those words and thought i had finally made a break through with her, and maybe she was reconsidering and seeing my changes were true (they most certainly are, I've learned more from this horrible heartbreak, than anything else in my life, and am a man who learns well from his mistakes, i just tend to have to learn them the hard way.)

Fast forward a week, I ask her if i can take her to this cool bookstore i found and we can get coffee during or lunch or something. She didn't answer and the next day i find out on her instagram that she IS moving and decided to and told her friends, and went out with them to ""celebrate"" (all females). My reality was shattered, again. I texted her and said ""Damn, I'm happy for you, but i wish you would have at least told me."" She apologized and said she didn't mean for me to find out like that and planned on telling me that day. This was kind of not true because she ""celebrated"" Saturday night and i found out and texted her Sunday afternoon around 3pm. If she planned to tell me there was plenty of opportunity. Granted she didn't owe me any explanation, but still this is my best friend and someone i was romantically involved with for 9 years, it only felt fair to me really, and i would never have done that to her, but anyway doesn't much matter, what mattered is she was moving states, far too like 1000 miles, across the country, states.

Fast forward to the week before the move. I owe her nothing, and really was just being way too nice and way too accepting and understanding, but i love this person and want to do anything i can to show them that, regardless of the situation. For the last 4 days she was here i helped her with everything. Moving her things out of the apartment, being there for her, helping her with logistics, just being there even though i was completely dying inside. The very last day the apartment was empty, it was surreal. She texted me that she was getting the very last of everything out, but had to shower but there was no curtain. I texted her back that i wanted to see her shower with no curtain, and she said well hurry up and bring a mop (the apartment was covered in salt from the winter) So i leave work and rush over. She waited for me and then let me watch her shower and came out naked and stayed that way for a whole lot longer than necessary, i loved every second of it and tried to have sex one last time, but she said no, and im not a pig so i said okay no problem, but continued to flirt with her and complement her naked body. She got dressed and we cleaned everything left in the apartment. We've lived together for 4 years and each time we moved we would use the empty space in the living room to dance, so i grabbed her hand and we danced one last time in the empty living room. We drove to the front office and i returned the keys for her. Asked for her for one last kiss, she said no, so i asked for one on the cheek. She said okay, but i better not turn my head. I wanted to of course, but i didn't. I kissed her on the cheek and that was it we drove away and that was the last time i saw her.

When she moved i made sure she settled in and was safe and okay and then i decided to go no contact to heal, because clearly it was over at this point. I didn't tell her directly because i didn't feel the need to. 8 days go by and i get a ""how are you doing"" text from her. Yet again, i'm so happy to hear from her thinking, even with the distance, something changed her mind. I knew i had to be nuetral though and replied im good, how are you doing? She then tells me she had an ovarian cyst rupture and had been in and out of urgent care. I was very upset to hear this and told her i wish i could be there in person to support her and reacted how any person with a conscious or in love would, despite still being totally heartbroken (I had done nothing during these past months but want her back). So after that talk i made sure she was feeling better the next day. We didn't talk for two more days, then started texting every day afterward for 4-5 days straight. Again I'm very invested and didn't care about the distance, i love this girl with my whole heart, so i ate up every valuable second of contact made. She tells me she is still sleeping with her mattress on the floor because she doesn't know how to build the bed frame (I always did so), and she said she was going to hire a task rabbit for $100 to do it. I said absolutely not, just call me tomorrow and we'll fix it for you. She does and i did, and it's as if nothing between us has changed, still get along amazingly and can talk effortlessly. I of course throw some flirting in their because i want her to know i want more than friendship still. Anyway she gets an incoming call from a work associate (female) and we hang up. She calls back saying something is wrong with the bed, turns out we used the wrong setting, anyway doesn't matter, we sort it out and talk for another hour. 

Now here's where my question starts to come into play, i know long as hell story here, i'll do a TL;DR below, maybe up top lol. Anyway, every single time we've texted or talked I'm scouring reddit/internet for reconciliation stories, trying to cling to any ounce of hope out there, sifting through stories for hours and hours, hindering my work and certainly destroying any healing i've ever made, always back to square one. So i text her and ask how long she plans to stay in her new state, and she says ""well i don't plan on moving back, but it's only been a month so who knows."" I'm fucking totally devastated all over again, my own fault i guess. So i tell her ""well shit i guess i really do just have to try my best to completely move on then."" She gets upset for some reason and says, ""Did you hope i would hate it here?? that's not fair."" I said, ""Absolutely not, not at all, i just hoped you would miss home, or maybe miss me."" Some context here, she moved across the country with absolutely no one at all, all of her friends and family live here, she does not know a single person in her new state, hence why i made sure she was all good upon arriving there, and plus i love her so there was that lol. Anyway i don't here back from her until later that night. She says, ""sorry i dont mean to not respond i just don't know what to say to that. I shouldn't have called you, I know that doesn't help and I'm the one that originally reached out to you after moving too, it's just a lot, but that's not your problem."" I was shocked to hear her say she reached out first, because even when she has in the past, she's never actually admitted to it. I reply saying, ""I shouldn't have let you either, I mean i urged it when i knew it would set me back, but i just wanted to be there for you, but it does just set me back every time because I want something that's not there. I'll always love and miss you you but I do think it's best for me to really have time and space for now because as much as i love talking to you and being there for you, it's not helping me and it's not helping you. I want you to know that i don't say this lightly at all, it's extremely hard for me to put myself first right now and I've been unable to let go because i do not want to at all, it's the absolute last thing I want to do, but I see now that it's the only option I have. I rally do wish you all the best in life and I'll always love and miss you for real.""

She responds after a few hours and says, ""I want you to put yourself first, I really do. And i totally get it. Before, when you were the one reaching out to me it made it that much harder every time, so I do understand. I'm just experiencing so much stuff and then find myself just wanting to tell you about it. I did think the distance would help us but idk. I am sorry about the other day though calling you and such."" I really don't know what she meant by the distance helping us? So if anyone read this far, if you could try to explain that, I like to understand it more.

I respond with a LONG message:

""I know you do, and I know me reaching out wasn‚Äôt right then, but I just wanted it to be different, I wanted us to try again badly, I still do and that‚Äôs my problem. You just mean so much more to me than just a friend, and I feel like that‚Äôs where things were heading if we kept texting and talking, even though I fucking wish I was there to experience all of this with you, and seriously love hearing from you and hearing what‚Äôs going on with you, like seriously I always have because I‚Äôve always loved you very much, so when you talk I listen and I hate that that has to go, but I know I will just always want to be with you again as more than friends, and I know that‚Äôs just not how you see it right now, maybe ever again. I just know one day you‚Äôll meet someone else, and we won‚Äôt be able to be friends anyway, or you‚Äôll tell me about them, and I can‚Äôt handle that kind of second devastation ya know? Like it‚Äôd probably be worse than the breakup and that‚Äôs why I know in my heart I couldn‚Äôt be just friends. I mean it literally fucking destroys me to say that, but it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs okay that you called me and texted me, trust me I loved every second of it, I loved hearing your voice and laugh, I always miss it, and miss causing it, but always the next day I‚Äôd be scouring the internet for stories about reconciling and stuff and putting so much energy into it, and then you‚Äôd say things that made it clear you don‚Äôt want that, and so it just makes it too hard. I think the distance will be good for us, if at some point in your new life you do want what I want and we find ourselves wanting to try again, then I think the distance would help a lot, because I feel like if you were still in Michigan right now, then enough time wouldn‚Äôt have past for us to properly try again, because as we‚Äôve both said, the old relationship would need to be a thing of the past completely, and we‚Äôd have to fall in love with the new versions of ourselves (which I think would be VERY EASY, more than a measly spark, it‚Äôd be fireworks) and start a new relationship together. I do think if that ever happened we‚Äôd would seriously have better chances than 99% of people in this world and I honestly and truly believe that with all my heart. I don't know what the best thing to do is because I want you in my life and have never been able to picture it without you ever, i mean never ever, but i know it wasn't as friends, it was a family. So like i said this is not fucking easy for me in any way to say or do, it rips me apart as much as the breakup itself.""

And that was that, It's only been two days since, but i don't plan on contacting her, and she will likely respect my request and not contact me either. I'm afraid though, because I don't think I'll ever want what she wants, and i don't know if she will ever want what i want, and that kills me, but i know i can't be just friends, it's just not possible for me right now, likely ever, and it sucks because i'm losing my very best friend forever. I'm also afraid that if things change in her mind, that because i pretty much asked for no contact, that she would be afraid to reach out to me about it.

Do you think i made the right choice in saying these things and basically telling her i need to go no contact, or should i have not said anything about it? My fear was that she would have continued to stay in touch, and i would have always answered her and been there for her despite everything, because i deeply care for her and love her, but i don't think it would have lead to what i want to have, a second chance at a romantic long happy life together. Is it possible through the extreme distance to maintain a friendship in hopes she returns to her home state and we can start a new relationship, or is that absurd? I feel it's just my hopeful ass clinging to unrealistic expectations, and that ultimately i've made the right choice, but am not fully sure.

  
TL;DR. Ex broke up with me and moved across the country. I was endlessly there for her the entire breakup and helped her move. She told me she didn't plan on coming back. I told her I need to stay out of contact with her then. I told her i still love her and want things she doesn't want and that i have to move on, reluctantly.

i started by raking rocks out of the soil. 

now i know that i should have dug 2-4 feet down to get all the rocks and i'm considering whether it's worth it to re-dig my oldest beds. the backyard is all contractor-fill -- a mix of clay, building rubble, sand, and a surface of organic matter. very basic Ph, not that i've ever tested. i assume the dirt is contaminated with rodenticide, cat pee, heavy metals, and microplastics. i assume that, then garden with weird dirt in mind.

then i scattered packets of flower seed mixes: shade tolerant, drought tolerant, tolerant of wet, native flowers, flowers for pollinators. these can be found for free at the libraries, botanical gardens, brooklyn naval cemetery landscape, etc. i foraged flower seeds from abandoned lots as well - morning glory for the flowers, and chicory and lambsquarter for the eating. 

sweet alyssum took off and has been going strong since. bee balm, columbine, and coreopsis grew first and most vigorously. maybe one day i'll post my garden tracker; dozens of plants are out there. i hoped for goldenrod and milkweed, but so far all i have is one lackadaisical butterfly weed. i'll try again this year, since my neighbors have dryer yards than i. 

my yard is a mix of shade, light, dry, and swampy. we get run-off from us and the neighbors so i have a rain garden in progress near my gutter. there's a mulberry tree on one end that drops delicious fruit. in the center i planted a blueberry. catalpa trees on the other end shade us during the heat of summer. eventually i want do get some forest flowers growing. in the catalpa understory, there's a young mimosa tree and my thicket of four-inch-tall pawpaw babies. 

that first year was flowers and the strawberries that were here. the next year was flowers and tomatoes and edible greens. last year was flowers and tomatoes and edible greens and shrubs and ferns! this year, more of the same with mature perennials and more snap peas. each year the soil is more rich and healthy. two winters ago, i built a worm tower to process household compost and it's been a massive success. 

the garden more or less looks after itself. that being said, i'll need to tend to the bee balm that planted itself last fall, to make sure it's not planted to close to itself. i don't water anything once it's established. the plants mulch themselves, especially with the catalpa leaves. my friends bring me coffee and tea compost to add acid to the soil. 

we've had rats. i haven't seen them in a year but i assume they're near. still, digging all the rocks out of the dirt reduces their shelter and i have wild onions scattered. i hope to get mint going as well.",1,1742497939.0,NYC_Gardening,0,1.0,False

I've been attending protests in NYC both as an activist and as an NYC ACLU Protest Monitor. I've been frustrated by the **low turnout at protests** specifically focused on Trump's corruption and the rising fascism in our country.

While protests for issues like Palestine, LGBT rights, and immigration are incredibly important, I believe **combating the growing authoritarian threat** posed by Trump and his administration should be our **top priority**. There are already many protests focused on these areas that get significantly larger turnouts in comparison to protests broadly against Trump. Even when there is a protest against Trump, half of the messaging is focused around these issues. Which again, I recognize as extremely important, but lets focus on the root cause at this time - TRUMP and his administration.

I want to organize a **meetup in NYC** to discuss how we can **increase turnout** at these crucial protests and develop **effective strategies** for pushing back against fascism. We need to come together, share ideas, and start planning **real action**. My goal is to help **amplify our resistance** and make sure our voices are heard in the face of rising authoritarianism.

If you're passionate about **protecting democracy**, **fighting fascism**, and **making real change**, let‚Äôs meet for drinks or coffee and talk about how we can organize **larger protests** and **more impactful activism**. Let‚Äôs make sure we‚Äôre not just **talking about change**, but actively working for it.

**Location**: I'm open to suggestions as I've never organized something like this. I'm in Williamsburg but happy to meet up in Manhattan or at a big bar in Brooklyn. Maybe Spritzenhaus?

üìñ I prefer non-fiction and / or historical fiction. My three most recent favorite reads are Che Guevara - A Revolutionary Life, Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind and currently reading Clueless People - A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism. Books in my to read soon list include Far From the Tree by Andrew Solomon, Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders and Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin, among many others. Honestly, I am often reading more than one book at a time. I also enjoy reading the NYT, WSJ, numerous substacks and listening to podcasts like The Ezra Klein Show, Making Sense with Sam Harris and Club Random with Bill Maher.  
üìç Meetups could be in a local caf√©, library, pub, or other cozy spot.  
üìÖ Possibly meeting once a month (maybe on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon) to give everyone time to read.  
üéâ Laid-back, social vibes‚Äîjust good conversation and good books!

About me: I am single 45F and live in Waltham. Have a professional full-time WFH job and a dog that I love.

If this sounds like something you‚Äôd be into, drop a comment or DM me! Also open to suggestions on format, meeting places, or book picks. Let‚Äôs see if we can get a group together!",7,1742497838.0,Waltham,4,0.89,False

I usually grind light pourover at about 55 to 65 on my DF54.

I'm using the Mugen with Tetsu Kasua's recipe of 25g in/300g out with a single 15 second pour.

The ideal suggested drawdown is about 1:30 according to Kasua'.

However, my draw down was close to 4 minutes using Hario filters. 

I jumped to the max course setting of 90 on the DF54  and switched to T-90 filters.

Drawdown was still over 3 minutes. 

I noticed more fine chaff than usual getting stuck on the DF54 chute.

I'm wondering if the slow drawdown is more likely to be mostly due to the beans or limitations of the grinder. 

Any thoughts?

Thanks.

The first batch of coffee frozen custard that I made used Chef John‚Äôs vanilla base and did a Josh weissmans coffee ice cream method (steep the beans, etc). It was on the sour side. Could‚Äôve been the beans I used, also had more cream compared to milk , so the mouthfeel was a bit different

Buenas tardes, Guelfitas. 

  
Voy para un a√±o en Guelph, se me ha hecho complicado entablar una amistad o al menos conocer gente en esta ciudad, una de las razones, creo la principal soy yo, pues porque le pongo peros al accionar, es decir, me quedo encerrado en mi casa, creyendo cosas que nunca pasan. (Tengo trabajo, pero trabajo desde casa). Estoy trabajando eso en terapia, pero es complicado, en mi pa√≠s, yo ten√≠a la estructura y tambi√©n, pues, las relaciones que necesitaba. Creo que con la edad se hace m√°s complicado hacer amigos y m√°s en otro pa√≠s y m√°s a√∫n con otro idioma que no es el tuyo. Mi pareja est√° haciendo lo mejor que puede para mantenerse firme y de verdad estoy contento por √©l. 

  
Por eso hago este post, si t√∫ eres un latino ac√° en Guelph, que tambi√©n se le est√° haciendo complicado conseguir alguien para hablar, yo estoy disponible para un caf√© y hablar un rato. Yo estoy libre de martes a jueves, fines de semana, trabajo, pero igual se puede sacar un tiempo para salir un rato.

  
S√≠, t√∫ eres alguien que est√° aprendiendo espa√±ol, quieres conversar con alguien para practicar tu espa√±ol, estoy libre. Si hablas espa√±ol de segunda generaci√≥n, tambi√©n. 

  
Yo estoy aprendiendo franc√©s, as√≠ que si t√∫ sabes franc√©s ser√≠a excelente para irlo practicando.

Y si t√∫ eres un canadiense abierto a conocer personas de otros pa√≠ses y hablar y pasar el rato, tambi√©n estoy disponible. 

  
Gracias.

Hello, 

Good afternoon, 

Guelphites,

I'm approaching a year in Guelph, and it's been difficult for me to establish friendships or at least meet people in this city. One of the reasons, probably the main one, is me, because I put up barriers to taking action - meaning I stay locked up in my house, believing things that never happen. (I have a job, but I work from home). I'm working on this in therapy, but it's complicated. In my country, I had the structure and relationships that I needed. I think with age it becomes more difficult to make friends, especially in another country and even more so with a language that isn't your own. My partner is doing the best they can to stay strong, and I'm truly happy for him.

That's why I'm making this post. If you're a Latino here in Guelph who is also finding it difficult to find someone to talk to, I'm available for coffee and chatting for a while. I'm free from Tuesday to Thursday; on weekends I work, but we can still make time to go out for a bit.

If you're someone who is learning Spanish and wants to talk with someone to practice your Spanish, I'm available. If you speak Spanish as a second-generation speaker, that's fine too.

I'm learning French, so if you know French, it would be excellent to practice it.

And if you're a Canadian open to meeting people from other countries, talking and hanging out, I'm also available.

1jfwnwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jfwnwi/my_recently_discovered_keto_lifehack/,My recently discovered Keto lifehack,"I don't use a ton of heavy whipping cream or butter. I use 1 Tbsp of HWC per day in my bulletproof coffee and probably a little less than that of butter when averaged out over the course of a week. This means I'm constantly buying 16oz containers of HWC (the smallest size available at my grocery stores) only to have them start to turn before I can get more than halfway through one.

Until recently, I just accepted this as a fact of life. I was going to waste just about as much HWC as I was using. But then a thought came to mind, and I looked up how to make butter.

Using a mason jar that I'd already had on hand, I put my muscles to work on the heavy whipping cream, shaking vigorously for a good long while until the milk fats coalesced and eventually congealed into a solid form, leaving me with butter and buttermilk.

Since happening upon this, I've made my own butter three times already and haven't needed to purchase any. It's not really saving me all that much money, but it's making me feel a bit better about how much waste I'm sending to the landfills (or dumping down the drain).

**Meet Ori ‚Äì Lead 3D Artist**

Hey!

This time, we sat down with Ori | Lead 3D Artist, the guy who makes sure everything you see on the battlefield looks as epic as it plays. Units, buildings, explosions ‚Äì he sculpts the chaos so you can command it.



**üîπ Callsign & Role:** 

""The Artisan ‚Äì I craft the warzone, making every unit, building, and explosion as unforgettable as the battle itself.""



**üîπ Which unit, building, or feature excites you the most?**

""The Superweapon. There‚Äôs nothing more satisfying than watching something you built on screen completely change the course of the battle. It‚Äôs not just power ‚Äì it‚Äôs a visual statement that the battlefield belongs to you.""



**üîπ How did you get into game development?**

 ""I‚Äôve always loved creating 3D models ‚Äì even before I knew what I‚Äôd do with them. But the first time I saw one of my models explode in an actual game, I knew this was it. From that moment, I wasn‚Äôt just making models. I was building worlds.""



**üîπ What‚Äôs the most influential game in your life?**

 ""Age of Empires taught me how to think strategically and build from the ground up, and Runescape taught me patience, progression, and the value of resources. Together, they shaped the way I approach game design: balance strategy with economy, and make it all feel rewarding.""



**üîπ What crazy strategy do you hope players will try?**

 ""I really hope someone goes full economic domination ‚Äì hoard every resource, build a monstrous industrial complex, and steamroll the map with pure production power. There‚Äôs nothing more beautiful than winning with sheer overwhelming force.""



**üîπ What‚Äôs your best tip for someone new to RTS games?**

 ""Easy: if you don‚Äôt know what to do ‚Äì build. Build more units, build more economy, build more everything. You can figure out the strategy as you go, but you‚Äôll never regret having too many resources.""



**üîπ What‚Äôs the hardest part of developing an RTS game?**

 ""Balance. Not just between units and factions, but between visual fidelity and performance. There‚Äôs so much going on at once, and making it all look great without making your PC cry? That‚Äôs the real challenge.""



**üîπ If you were a unit in the game, what would you be?**

 ""A stealth unit. Working behind the scenes, making sure everything looks perfect before anyone ever sees it. No flashy entrance ‚Äì just flawless execution.""



**üîπ What‚Äôs your real-life ‚Äòcheat code‚Äô?**

 ""Perfection takes time, but deadlines don‚Äôt care. So I learned how to make things perfect‚Ä¶ fast.""



**üîπ Which in-game building would you want in real life?**

 ""A Command Center. Everything in one place, total control, no distractions‚Ä¶ sounds perfect.""



**üîπ Micro or Macro?**

 ""Macro. Control the economy, control the game. Simple as that.""



**üîπ In a Defcon Zero apocalypse, what would your role be?**

 ""Logistics and infrastructure. People talk about firepower, but wars are won by those who can keep the machine running.""



**üîπ One question for the community?**

 ""What‚Äôs the battle you still remember years later?""



**üîπ Final message to the community:**

 ""Every unit, every explosion, every piece of the battlefield ‚Äì it‚Äôs all built with care, stress, and more coffee than I‚Äôd like to admit. We‚Äôre doing this for you. I can‚Äôt wait to see how you use what we‚Äôve made. This battlefield? It‚Äôs yours.""

On here people sometimes post pictures of their expensive espresso set ups with syrup bottles standing next to them. Some people make posts about their favourite syrups or how to DIY them - and people happily chime in and discuss.

I am just completely baffled by this. To me and all coffee-nerds I know syrups are an unforgivable sacrilege and synonymous of starbucks and the like. If I see a syrup bottle at someones home, I just know they live on another coffee-planet then me and that there is no sense in having a conversation about coffee in the first place.

I live in central Europe but have travelled around the world plenty - yet I have never noticed syrups in specialty coffee shops abroad. So I really need to sak:

1jfwhqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jfwhqm/update_karma_serves_cold/,[UPDATE] Karma serves cold,"I am here to add the rest of the gossip left from the last time. So, I ended the last post by telling you about my ex.

Not long after the 'blocking' and saying, 'I hope you have a better life after this.' 

My ex texted me AGAIN. This time, with a number that I wasn't aware of. Yup, he texted me with an unknown number. As creepy as it was. Turns out he had this number the whole fucking time. For the last fucking five years, including the one year that he and I dated, I had no idea that this guy HAD ANOTHER NUMBER. 

He texted me to ask about my ""sexuality"". For context, I came out as bisexual last year in May. And this conversation happened at the start of this year. 

I am not out to any of my high school friends, nor do I post much about it. But I guess news travels a lot faster than you can grasp. 

He texted me asking if I had always been into girls. And he was in shock because I have always been dating guys. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe he just found out I am into girls and thought I was a lesbian. Which would be a good slap in his face. But at what cost? No one knew that we dated, so it made no sense. 

The ""were you into girls while we were dating"" pissed me off.

I told him I 'realised' last year that I was also into women. I don't know if I 'were' into them while we were dating. I really thought he wasn't aware of my bisexuality, but it turns out he was. He doesn't know the difference and thinks all of the community altogether just means being into the same gender and not being into the other gender at all. And to believe that I dated this brat. I just pity over my younger self. Yes, he is extremely homophobic to the point he thinks that all K-pop idols are 'gay' and 'women'. And he is one of those people who, no matter the nationality (Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese), are all Korean 'girls'. 

A part of me wanted to say that I only dated 'you' as a cover for my hidden sexuality, but tbh, it would be disrespectful to my coming out. 

He then proceeds to make snarky comments about how he didn't expect me to be 'that way' and how 'He wouldn't have minded me f*ing girls while we were together as he thought it was sexy.'

I was infuriated that I didn't know what to say. 

If you have read the last post, you know his ex told our high school common circle that I proposed to him, but we did not date. He then used my sexuality, saying he knew all along,, and that was the reason he never dated me. Because he 'saw' the way I looked at women. EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW, HOW DID YOU?

(JFC: I came out in a very safe environment. I almost only came out to my highly supportive university friends. I basically realised it on my 20th birthday but didn't come out till I almost turned 21 (last year) because I wanted to be sure.) 

Basically, one of the people in that common group are closeted, particularly among that group, because they are afraid that they'll become a joke, too. They came out to me recently and apologised for their behaviour. They couldn't believe how many people were not aware of what bisexuality is and the stereotypes that they were reducing me to. (Basically, a famous person rejected a girl in 2015, and this girl is currently married to a girl. And, of course, she is bisexual. And they started comparing our story to theirs and how he got 'safe' by rejecting me. It'sa huge deal, basically.) They asked me if I ever dated coffee. I asked them why. And they just said that they realised this was a setup, and Coffee didn't want to hold accountability. And then they told me, and I quote, ""I don't know if you dated him or not, but if you did. Just know that the only reason he never owned up to you was that he had some sides to scrape. If you never dated him, it means you were just another side piece, but if you did, know he wasn't faithful much.""

I seriously have no idea how to feel about it. And if I am being honest, I don't even feel anything. I expected this, but I am hurt that I 'expected' this. How bad can you treat a person so that they will be okay with you being disloyal to someone during a whole year of relationship? And worse, the bisexuality thing. I haven't processed it yet and am trying to move past it. I don't know how to feel. This person is no longer necessary in my life, and I don't want his comments to hold anything.

But this bag is just the mystery. There is no reveal! There's no indication as to where the beans are from, the varietal, even the type of roast ‚Äî only all this strange, medieval England-coded language suggesting that the beans are flipping magic and will transform you into a warrior (??). Like, are they bred to contain extra caffeine? Are they dark roasted? Are they co-fermented with coca extract? Lol. I haven't the faintest idea what Perc are on about here. 

All in all, very confusing and weird. I haven't even tried the beans yet, and I concede that, maybe, I could do so and return in a couple of hours to eat my words and proselytize about the beans' magic, which, who would have thunk, is actually real! I took one sip and found myself covered head-to-toe in Camelot chic, gauntlets, jousting lance, and all. But in the meantime I'm mostly just baffled. Don't get it.

1jfwfy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1jfwfy4/is_this_a_gdpr_breach/,Is this a GDPR Breach?,"Have I done the wrong thing?

I work in accommodation and handed my notice in just over 3 weeks ago due to relocating. My job is customer facing as i work on the front desk (reception area). When a few of the tenants moved out last year they asked me to follow them on Instagram and after they moved out we slowly became friends.

When I say friends I mean we literally went for coffee once and we talk on Instagram just about life in general.

It is my last week this week so some of my friends (who moved out a year ago - previous tenants) came to visit at my workplace to say goodbye as I'm leaving the city. During this my friend started speaking to a guy she thought was cute (who is a current tenant) and then when he walked away she wrote down her Instagram handle on a post-it note and asked me to give it to him as she was too shy to give it him herself.

Later that day when the guy returned to reception I gave him the post-it note explaining it was from my friend he was speaking to earlier. He smiled, said ‚ÄúThanks, cool, yeah. I'll reach out to her‚Äù then walked away.

Is this a GDPR breach? My boss said it was and dismissed me on the spot and told me not to come in for my final day. He gave me no prior warning about this. I assumed it wasn't a GDPR breach because the tenant who's Instagram it is no longer lives at the accommodation we work for and of course - she consented to, it's not like it was leaked without her knowing.

I don‚Äôt really seem to have much luck when I post here but I‚Äôm back again nonetheless. I am looking for someone kind, caring, considerate, respectful and is willing to share the effort they will receive from me. I have a big heart, a curious mind and a gentle yet flirty soul. 

I am 6‚Äô2‚Äù, slim with dark hair and glasses. I am more on the introverted side too if you feel that might be more your type, but I‚Äôm not withdrawn. I am not shy about my looks either, so would be happy to share a picture if you get that far. I work in healthcare and I‚Äôm studying alongside my job.

I am a naturally curious person and love getting to know people from scratch; what interests you, how you like your tea or coffee and what interests you and what you might be passionate about in your daily life. If you consider yourself to be weird, different or even completely normal, I don‚Äôt want you to change for me. I want you to embrace what makes you happy and just be yourself and I will embrace the beautiful person you are too.

As for my interests, I like all kinds of sports. Football mostly, but I enjoy them all and understand they‚Äôre not for everyone. I like getting outdoors on hikes and walks and taking pictures when I can but I also feel in a happy place in front of the TV watching a series, crime documentary or a movie. Rom-com, action, mystery or even the occasional horror! I have an Xbox too, so if you do like video games then that‚Äôs something we can have some fun with because I can be quite an active gamer and I do have the Xbox Game Pass. I also like writing from time to time.

There is a lot more to me than I feel I should share in an opening post, but if you are interested in getting to know me or feel like I could be a positive match for you or just what you need, then please don‚Äôt hesitate to message me and then we could maybe take it to discord, WhatsApp or something.

I‚Äôm someone who thrives on deep conversations, meaningful connections, and exploring different aspects of life, both intellectually and experientially.

Photo of me: [https://imgur.com/a/2xcQAWP](https://imgur.com/a/2xcQAWP)

I consider myself a thinker and a conversationalist. I enjoy philosophy, psychology, and media that challenge perspectives. *Ghost in the Shell* is one of my favorite anime because of its deep themes about technology and consciousness, and I love breaking down ideas in a way that leads to real discussion.

I‚Äôm a pretty chill guy overall. I‚Äôm not a standup comedian, but I try to make life funny when I can. I appreciate a good sense of humor and believe that even deep conversations don‚Äôt have to be overly serious all the time. There‚Äôs something great about finding someone you can talk about anything with, whether it‚Äôs philosophy, relationships, or just a ridiculous observation that makes you laugh.

I also enjoy being active and outdoors‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs walking, hiking, or visiting nature parks. Sports are another interest of mine, both playing and watching, especially basketball and football. And when I‚Äôm in a more social mood, I like checking out new places, from coffee shops to laid-back bars, where a good conversation can make the night.

In relationships, I value honesty, confidence, and a genuine openness to exploring desires. I appreciate dynamics built on trust, communication, and mutual excitement. Finding a connection where both partners can openly share what fulfills them is something I deeply enjoy. Whether you already know what you like or are just curious, I believe the most meaningful experiences come from understanding and embracing what works best for both people.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm looking for someone who enjoys open, honest communication and isn‚Äôt afraid to explore new experiences. Whether it‚Äôs discussing big ideas, spending time outdoors, or sharing unique dynamics in a relationship, I appreciate authenticity and real engagement.

I‚Äôve never chatted with this guy before. He‚Äôs the representative of medicine program, so he was pretty activated on group chat to address the issues, mediate conflicts, negotiate with professors, etc. 

So one day, such idea just came to my mind. I dropped him a message to invite him to a cafe. (he‚Äôs pretty considerate that he wanted to go to one near my dorm.) 

At that day, I sit on the only available seat  in cafe beside a banana tree. Few minutes later, this middle eastern beard man shown up. We shook hands( yep hairy as usual) and I bought him a coffee. 

The atmosphere warmed up quickly since we got similar experiences. Then we talked the drawback of bureaucracy structures in academic systems and creeps we met at uni. Later we deep dived into more of the topics countries we lived for few years.

This nerdy innocent guy was giving off an asexual abstinence vibe. Neither up for or against any form of romantic relationships including homosexuality.

Not gonna lie, I was really tempted. Kept thinking about how nice a glass of red after the kids went to sleep would be. But I knew I wouldn't stop at one glass. I could easily put away all 4 bottles in the 2 nights we were staying, and feel like s**t the whole weekend.

So I called reception and asked them to send housekeeping up to remove the alcohol from the room.

And I didn't think about it for the rest of the weekend.

The hotel restaurants were another story: a beer while waiting for kids to finish playing in the playhouse also sounded great, but the sheer thought of ordering put me off and I stuck to coffee.

Glad I played the tape forward and thought to call reception. They were super nice about it and took care of it within 10 minutes. Very grateful to still be sober this week.",47,1742495372.0,stopdrinking,9,0.97,False

Here are 10 Safe Ways to Remove Ants Without Chemicals at Home.  
  
Number 1, Vinegar Solution: Mix equal parts of water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. This mix is great for disrupting those pesky scent trails ants leave behind, making it harder for them to find their way back.  
  
Number 2, Baking Soda and Sugar Mixture: Combine equal parts of baking soda and powdered sugar and place it in shallow dishes where you see ants. The sugar lures them in, while the baking soda messes with their digestive systems‚Äîit's a win-win for keeping things safe!  
  
Number 3, Essential Oils: Peppermint and tea tree oils work wonders as natural repellents. Just add a few drops to water in a spray bottle and apply it around entry points; those strong scents will help keep ants at bay.  
  
Number 4, Diatomaceous Earth: Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth in areas where you notice ant activity. This fine powder dehydrates the ants without harming your kids or pets, making it a safe option around the house.  
  
Number 5, Cinnamon: Sprinkle ground cinnamon or place sticks around entry points and trails. The strong smell really disrupts their scent trails, which can help keep them away for good.  
  
Number 6, Lemon Juice Solution: Mix one part lemon juice with three parts water and spray it around doorframes and windowsills. The acidity masks the scent trails, making it tough for ants to navigate.  
  
Number 7, Soap and Water Spray: Create a simple soap and water spray by mixing dish soap with water. When sprayed directly on ants, this solution breaks down their exoskeletons for immediate results.  
  
Number 8, Cornstarch: Sprinkle cornstarch where you've seen ant activity. They'll consume it but can't digest it, leading to their demise‚Äîwho knew cornstarch could be so effective?  
  
Number 9, Coffee Grounds: Scatter used coffee grounds around entry points or ant hills. Not only do they deter ants, but they also enrich your soil if you're gardening afterward.  
  
Number 10, Chamomile Tea: Brew chamomile tea and let it cool before spraying it around entry points. The pleasant scent is great for humans but repels ants effectively!

1jfvtwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagnificentCentury/comments/1jfvtwf/playing_the_devils_advocate_for_murad_iv/,Playing the Devil‚Äôs Advocate for Murad IV,"Murad is objectively one of the worst and most morally bankrupt people in both shows, and a lot of his acts are indefensible, but since I always liked a challenge, I decided to try and plead his case. This defense won‚Äôt try to excuse, understand or minimize all his actions (his domestic abuse tendencies for example) but rather try to understand where he‚Äôs coming from and see which of his actions deserved more credit than what they get, notably in his policies.¬†

**A life marked by instability and trauma**¬†

Murad was heavily shaped by all the trauma he suffered as a child. He lost his father when he was only 4, then was locked up for months in a single room and almost murdered, then was a prisoner again of his brother Osman, his brother Mehmet was killed before his eyes, he then witnessed Osman being brutally humiliated and he was murdered shortly after. He was then almost burnt alive with his brothers. He was separated from his mother during this whole time and was constantly fearing for his life. All this happened before he was even eleven.¬†

**A controlling and emotionally abusive mother**¬†

Murad became sultan at the age of only eleven, under his mother‚Äôs regency. At first they were really close and Murad adored her, but as he grew up he started wanting to fly from his own wings, and his mother completely refused to let go of power. She did it in a very manipulative manner, she hired Musa Celebi to keep him away from the state‚Äôs affair, then when Murad frontally said he was ready to rule, she pretended she was ok with it and put on a show for him to ‚Äúplay‚Äù sultan, but then none of what he wanted happened. This can be seen as an attempt to pacify him but also I think there‚Äôs something more sinister to it because at this point Murad was like 15/16 at least and old enough to realize that none of his decisions were followed, so it was also a way to humiliate him and show him who was the real owner of the state.¬†

Also Kosem did the best she could but there was a lot of troubles, they lost Baghdad in 1624, which was really humiliating for the Ottomans and there were a lot of rebellions, and that played a part in Murad feeling even more frustrated because he wanted to change that but wasn‚Äôt allowed to even try.¬†

The rebellions were also really traumatic for him because they undermined his position as sultan and fed his paranoia that he would share the fate of Osman, but also because he lost many dear people to it, including Musa (literally the love of his life), which was given up by Kosem herself, who for all her smug talk about never being afraid of anyone, was almost always quick and ready to hand the rebels what they wanted, which also fed Murad‚Äôs resentment towards her.¬†

Then when he starts taking over, we see Kosem reacting like a true narcissistic mother (analysis [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MagnificentCentury/comments/1j9s0h7/narcissistic_manipulation_in_kosem_and_murads/)) and then proceeds to undermine him almost constantly.¬†

This explains a lot about Murad‚Äôs inferiority complex and his constant need to prove himself, as well as his paranoia and mistrust of others.¬†

**His fears were not unjustified**

Between his mother actively undermining him, the rebels menacing him and foreign powers conspiring against him, it's understandable that Murad felt surrounded by threats on all sides. His position as sultan was far from secure; the Janissaries had already deposed and murdered one sultan (Osman), and they made it clear they could do it again. His own family was a constant source of danger, his brothers were potential rivals (the legacy and trauma of the fratricide law still lingered strongly over their heads), and his mother‚Äôs political maneuvering made him question whether he could even trust his own family.

In such an environment, paranoia wasn‚Äôt just a personal flaw, it was a survival mechanism. Murad knew that any sign of weakness, hesitation, or mercy could be his downfall. His ruthlessness was as much a response to the instability of the empire as it was to his personal trauma. He believed he had to rule through fear because love, loyalty, and trust had all failed him before. It's very telling to me that when he recalls his meeting with Musa, one of the only people who genuinely touched his soul, he says ""to be a sultan is to be alone"", because everyone wants something from you. It it shows how deeply he internalized the belief that no one could ever love him for who he was, only for what he could give them, which also explains why he adopted a rather cynical and jaded view of the world

**His policies were cruel, but not without merits**¬†

I don‚Äôt condone Murad‚Äôs policies, especially all the mass killings, but I can see where he was coming from. The state had grown unstable, with an army always ready to rebel and the soldiers really started to believe that they were the ones who could decide who gets to be sultan. They got so arrogant they even said as much to Murad‚Äôs face. It can be argued that the state was in need of an authority ‚Äúshock‚Äù, and that Murad‚Äôs terror regime was a temporary necessity to restore order.

Even the bans, though hypocritical, were not just arbitrary. He targeted coffee shops and wine shops because they were places of public reunion and circulation of ideas, and thus possibly sedition. He also wanted to make his subjects fear him so they wouldn‚Äôt rebel. As Tiberius said ‚ÄúLet them hate me as long as they fear me‚Äù.¬†Finally, banning things like alcohol made him more popular in certain parts of the population.

And indeed, it bore its results, Kosem herself was forced to admit that Murad had made some great achievement: he crushed the rebels, he replenished the state coffers and re-instaured Ottoman prestige by conquering Baghdad. Of course it was relatively soon undone by Ibrahim‚Äôs incompetence and we could argue that Murad failed to make his impact long-lasting, but then again he only had 8 years at the helm and the last ones were spent being an alcoholic and sick, so not bad really.

There are other decisions he‚Äôs often reproached for where I can understand where he was coming from: executing Gulbahar (she committed a massacre), marrying Atike and Silahtar (Atike told him she would kill herself if he let him marry Gevrehan), putting Kasim and Ibrahim in the boxwood (one of his brothers had just attempted to kill him, deservedly so but still), wanting to execute his brothers and managing to kill Kasim (his mother murdered his wife and best friend to punish him and also was going to lock him up with his insane uncle to put Kasim on the throne), trying to kill his mother (she had attempted to dethrone him and imprison him and also had been taking away his medicine so he would die faster).¬†

In conclusion, Murad IV was a deeply flawed and often monstrous ruler, but he was also a product of his time, his upbringing, and a dynasty that thrived on cycles of paranoia, betrayal, and ruthless power struggles. His life was marked by loss, fear, and manipulation from an early age, and while none of that excuses his brutality, it explains much of his descent into tyranny. His policies, though cruel, were often motivated by an urgent need to stabilize an empire teetering on the edge of chaos, and in that respect, his reign did bring temporary order and renewed prestige to the Ottoman state.

His story is tragic to me because he was once capable of love, loyalty and ambition for something greater, but his attempts at reform and control were tainted by personal demons and a lack of trust, leaving him isolated, paranoid, and ultimately doomed.",1,1742495310.0,MagnificentCentury,1,1.0,False

I just hit the 50 lbs down mark (still can't believe it), and I wanted to share a few simple changes that made a HUGE difference for me. These are things I wish I had known when I started my weight loss journey. Hopefully this can help or motivate someone out there:

Actually track what you eat, every bite. I used to think I was eating around 1500 calories, but when I started tracking honestly, it turned out to be more like 2200 on many days. Whoops. Once I began logging everything (yes, even that handful of chips or the creamer in my coffee), it became way easier to spot where I was overeating. I personally started planning meals better with an app called Meal AI (it's on the App Store) ‚Äì it not only helped me log meals but also helped me keep weekly progress up so I have a longer term viewpoint.

Protein and veggies are your friends. Shifting my meals to be protein and veggie-focused kept me full on fewer calories. For example, I'd have Greek yogurt with berries for breakfast instead of cereal, or chicken & veggie stir-fry instead of pasta. I still eat carbs, but I prioritize protein now, and it really helps with satiety.

Stop drinking your calories. I had a bad soda and fancy coffee habit. Swapping to diet soda (or sparkling water) and learning to enjoy black coffee/green tea saved me hundreds of calories a day. I didn't realize how much sugary drinks were holding me back until I cut them out.

Find an activity you don‚Äôt hate. I'm not a gym rat, and I used to force myself to do intense cardio I despised. This time, I experimented until I found stuff I actually like. I started with walks in the park listening to funny podcasts, then tried a beginner dance cardio YouTube video which was surprisingly fun. Now I do a mix of walking, light jogging, and dance workouts in my living room. If you enjoy it (even a little), you're way more likely to keep doing it. Be kind to yourself and celebrate small wins. This journey is LONG and can be mentally tough. I learned to stop beating myself up over every small slip (one bad meal won't ruin everything) and started celebrating little victories: saying no to second helpings, choosing a healthy snack, or just consistently hitting my step goal for a week. Those small wins add up and keeping a positive mindset helped me stay on track.

These might seem obvious, but actually implementing them consistently was the game changer for me. I'm still on my journey (probably ~20 lbs to go to reach my goal), but I feel confident now that I have these tools in my toolbox. If you‚Äôre just starting out, I hope this list is helpful! You got this üí™. And if anyone else has simple tips that worked for them, I'd love to hear about it in the comments!",30,1742494915.0,1500isplenty,6,0.95,False

I met this lady through Facebook. At first, it honestly felt too good to be true. She‚Äôs 40, I‚Äôm 34. She has three kids and two ex-boyfriends. But weirdly enough, we vibed really well. Same music taste, same films, even some overlap in gaming‚Äîshe played World of Warcraft, which I hadn‚Äôt touched in a while, but it got me back into it. I even found her character in-game.

We met up for coffee. I live in Edinburgh, she‚Äôs in Musselburgh. She was in the process of moving from one place to another, and things just‚Ä¶ seemed to click. She was funny, relatable, tired-looking but still sweet. We both have some traits of autism and ADHD, so there was this mutual understanding that felt rare and refreshing.

But now? She‚Äôs ghosted me. Like, completely.

Can‚Äôt message her on Facebook anymore‚Äîjust says, ‚Äúthis person cannot be messaged.‚Äù Her profile is basically wiped from my end. I didn‚Äôt even get a warning. She even blocked me on WoW, which really hit weirdly hard. I still have her character‚Äôs name on my list, so maybe I‚Äôll try messaging her there, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

I really didn‚Äôt see any red flags. At first, sure, I was cautious‚Äîthought maybe it was a scam. But after meeting her in person, I thought, ‚Äúnah, this is real.‚Äù She seemed genuine. We had a similar lifestyle, and despite me not having kids or any relationship baggage, we seemed to connect well.

She did say she‚Äôd been having a rough week, so I thought maybe she just needed space. But this sudden cut-off? It's confusing as hell. Probably one of the most baffling ghostings I‚Äôve experienced‚Äîand I‚Äôve been ghosted before.

Anyway‚Ä¶ just venting. I‚Äôll probably send one last message in WoW and see what happens. But yeah. Back to being single. Again.",12,1742494608.0,ForeverAlone,9,1.0,False

Even though it's a DD delivery it's still hot when I get it thanks to the option of extra hot. üòä

 So I just wanted to show some gratitude to all the baristas, because honestly y'all deserve it. You put up with tough situations all day, every day, and get yelled at a lot. I'm always appreciative of my drink being made correctly the first time. You put up with the new CEO switching things up. You just plain don't get enough credit for making people's coffee's everyday. 

 So thank you baristas for helping make our day better with fantastic coffee. üòä It really is appreciated and I don't think that's said or expressed enough. This coffee has gotten me through some tough days, exam's, hangovers and the hot drinks (teas, apple spice) have helped on cold nights. Thank you!!!

One of the easiest and smoothest ways to enjoy coffee at home. Unlike traditional iced coffee, cold brew is made with cold water over a long extraction period (12 to 24 hours). Through our experience, we‚Äôve found that 20 hours is the sweet spot for the best flavors!

Why cold brew?

‚úÖ Zero acidity ‚Äì Cold water extraction keeps bitterness and acidity low, making it smooth and easy on the stomach.

‚úÖ High caffeine ‚Äì The long steeping process brings out a ton of caffeine, giving you a strong yet balanced energy boost.

‚úÖ Naturally smooth ‚Äì When made correctly, cold brew has such a clean, mellow flavor that you won‚Äôt need to add sugar or sweeteners.

We‚Äôre also experimenting with tea bags for cold brew ‚Äîa super convenient, easy, and affordable method that works really well!

Cold Brew Recipe with Tea Bag  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Take a tea bag filled with 80g (3oz) of coarse grind coffee  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Sink it into a jar with 1L (34oz) of cold water  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Let it rest in the refrigerator for 20 hours  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Gently take out the bag and enjoy!

Your cold brew will stay fresh for up to a week!

Curious where to get the tea bags? You can find them on Amazon! üòâ  
Enjoy your handmade cold brew and create wonderful memories! ‚òï‚ú®

I feel like it is even more frowned upon than even some ACTUAL commandments such as drinking coffee.

The reason I ask, as you may have guessed is that I have really wanted one. I know we don‚Äôt get tattoos because our body is a temple and we need to love and respect the amazing gift that our Heavenly Father has given us, but I take very good care of my body. I exercise, go to the gym, eat healthy food and I am very often the person that people decide to talk to when they want to get in shape.  I want a tattoo that actually means something to me, not some random thing, symbolism to me, just like how the temple has symbolism and art inside.  

I know that if I were to get a tattoo, despite deeply caring for my body and being an active member of the church with callings, I would be harshly judged by any member who sees it.  ",12,1742494425.0,latterdaysaints,49,0.65,False
1jfvgzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/reacher/comments/1jfvgzw/quinns_deal_makes_no_sense/,Quinn's deal makes no sense,"So he's selling guns to a domestically-based sleeper cell. In a country where getting hold of an assault rifle is only marginally harder than buying a coffee. And where a bomb would be 10x as efficient in killing civillians anyway (you make money selling arms in bulk to rebels/insurgent armies, not tiny terror cells).

Yet this deal for presumably just a handful of guns is apparently so big that it's enough to pay off his debts to the Russian Mafia, and keep his dozen or so mooks employed. And he needs it because he's basically broke.

Except he was selling arms for at least 5 years prior while based out of Chicago. As well as selling military secrets for god knows how long prior. So where did his money go?

The plot only works if you're willing to believe that Quinn is a genius mastermind who seemingly forgot where his money was stashed, and his only recourse was to borrow money from extremely dangerous people so he could sell guns at 10x the price to people who could just as easily get them from a gun store, and would be better off building a bomb anyway.

Oh, and he's borrowed money from the mob, despite holding Beck to ransom (who clearly has millions in assets as a successful arms dealer himself) instead of simply forcing him to give the seed money to Quinn instead.

Which seeing as he's using Beck's logistics, wouldn't even be that much. It's literally just the cost of goods.",11,1742494423.0,reacher,4,0.82,False
