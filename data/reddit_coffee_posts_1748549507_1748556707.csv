1kyno52,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHallowdineLibrary/comments/1kyno52/containing_secrets/,Containing Secrets,"Interviewing for a new job used to be a fraught experience for me. When you harbour such an intimate secret, you must be constantly vigilant, watchful for questions you might stumble over, anything that might alert the interviewer to your dark past.  
But over time, after hundreds of interviews, it does become much easier. The lies roll off your tongue smoothly, and the stories grow more concrete in detail and form. You learn to steer the conversation away from the locked doors in your history.  
Eventually it becomes so natural, so *easy*, that you don’t even think about it anymore. You truly *become* those stories; and with each telling, their narrative indelibly carves itself into the fabric of your being.  
And so, after what seemed the perfect interview, I got a job; and not just any job. This was the role that would kickstart my career, put my feet on the well-trodden path towards a real future. One where I was something other than a poor student with too many secrets.  
So long as nobody found out who I really was.

   
The first day was a predictable blur; I was shown my cubicle in the old but respectable art-deco building, then hustled through the induction process so I could be put to work as quickly as possible. Everyone in my team seemed nice. All legal secretaries like myself, we shared a four-seater pod in the cubicle farm, each workstation painfully personalised by the occupant, desperate to make some mark on the beige corporate landscape.  
“Gosh, you’re tall,” declaimed Trina, the slightly chubby redhead who sat beside me, “I bet you played volleyball at school.”  
“Oh yeah,” I lied smoothly, “captain of the team, until a knee injury got me.”  
Despite all my practice, I could feel the heat creeping into my ears and was immediately thankful I’d decided to wear my hair down that day. I know that seems like an odd thing to lie about. But the story I’d claimed as my own, the story that had now claimed me in turn, was so complete that I dared not deviate from its path, lest one wrong foot contradicted the narrative.  
By the end of the day I was exhausted. I half-dozed on the bus ride home, my energy depleted from so much social interaction, from navigating so many tiny, innocent pitfalls.  
But I’d done it. I’d survived my first day of work without incident.

   
The weirdness began after the fourth member of our team returned from a conference, a week after I started. Deborah was an older woman, unmarried, who took an instant dislike to me. She refused to shake my hand when introduced professionally, then proceeded to pile complex work on me, before I’d had enough time to learn the basics of my role.  
At first, despite creeping suspicion, I tried to write it off as simple envy. I mean, I was twenty, easy on the eye, and had a boyfriend; it didn’t take a psychology degree to figure out that she probably resented me for possessing everything that was lacking in her own life. But as things took a turn for the worse, I realised her behaviour had begun to spread, and the environment in the office was growing increasingly hostile toward me. No more was I greeted with pleasantries in the break room or cheery hellos in the elevator – everywhere I went, I met scowls and uncomfortable stares. After I walked in on the third whispered conversation that day, I knew the gig was up.  
My secret was out there, courtesy of Deborah, who I later discovered had worked with my sister in a previous job. The sister who didn’t exist in my new narrative; the one who delightfully informed everyone she met about her ‘brother’ and flashed around old pictures of me to anyone curious enough to look. And that seemed to be everyone.  
Just like that, I went from being ‘that tall new girl’ to something less than human; an object of ridicule, suspicion and loathing.

   
It was small things at first. Finding my keyboard unplugged, my papers missing, my coffee cup having an odd stain or odour. Subtle changes you could write off as nothings – accidents of no consequence. I mentioned them brightly to my team, commenting on how peculiar it was that they only seemed to happen to me. When Deb smirkingly sneered that the office ghost must not like me, my suspicions were all but confirmed.  
“Must be the same ghost who was always hanging around me at school,” I shot back, with a humourless smile.  
“Must be,” she retorted, “I hear this one doesn’t like *men*.”  
“What did you just say?”  
“I don’t have time for this,” Deb declared, turning back to her monitor, “I’ve got work to do.”  
Forcing down the shame and anger, I swivelled my seat back around abruptly – and slammed my knees into my desk. It seemed that ‘the office ghost’ must have lowered it again while I was on my break. Concentrating on the pain as it receded from my bruised flesh, I let my rage go with it. With ease born of practice, I watched it burn down to nothing, then extinguished it with one thought:  
No matter what anyone did or said to me, they couldn’t stop me being *me*.

   
Three weeks later my swipe card stopped working on the door to the women’s toilets.  
When I complained to ICT, they claimed it was a simple error, but the next morning, and the morning after that, my card access to the toilets had been cancelled again.  
“Maybe it would be easier to just use the *men’s* room,” the IT guy snarked down the phone, “there’s no swipe access on that door.”  
On the fifth morning in a row that the mysterious ‘error’ occurred, I met Walt Sawyer. He found me leaning against the door to the women’s bathroom with my cellphone to my ear, wearily asking ICT to fix the fault again. Walt had been the janitor here for so long that he was practically furniture; he’d seen the company go through three mergers and countless restructures. He’d survived all of them by simply going about his business, doing his job so well he was practically invisible.  
“Can’t get in again?” he asked, as I held the phone away from my ear to avoid the deafening hold music.  
“Yeah.”  
“I don’t think it’s right,” he mumbled, fishing in his pocket, “not right to treat a young lady like this.”  
Surely the gossip must have reached even the janitor by now?  
“Well, they don’t think I’m a lady, that’s the problem.”  
With a small, secret smile, Walt pressed something into my hand.  
“It’s my spare card. Will get you pretty much anywhere a janitor needs to be.”  
Simple kindness felt so out of place in this building that I just stared at the card in my hand like it was some kind of magical token. I finally opened my mouth to thank him, but he cut me off,  
“I wasn’t here. We never spoke.” He slopped a mopful of soapy water onto the stairs. “You ain’t the only one with secrets.”  
When the card reader flashed green and let me into the bathroom, I almost wept with relief.

   
What I expected to happen after that, I wasn’t sure. I was careful when I took my toilet breaks, making sure none of the other women saw me in the bathroom, so everyone would assume I had resigned myself to using the male facilities. You might think that this perceived win on their behalf would have de-escalated the situation, but with some bullies, any victory only emboldens them.  
I saw Walt scuttling away from my office space two early mornings that week, each time carrying something under his arm. And when my colleagues arrived, after me on both those days, their behaviour was even stranger than usual.  
When I caught Mark – the fourth member of my cubicle family – staring at my desk, I asked him if something was wrong.  
“No, nothing wrong,” he said, abrupt and defensive.  
“It just that you keep staring at my desk,” I pressed, not letting it go, “as if you’re surprised about something?” But he was already typing busily, ignoring me.  
Deb, especially, seemed put out. Her normal expression was less than pleasant, but today the downturned corners of her mouth practically touched her jawline, and she curled her lip like a caricature whenever I answered the phone or greeted someone entering our cubicle.

   
Walt was cleaning up a toner spill in one of the corridors, whistling tunelessly to himself while everyone ignored him.  
“I need a word,” I hissed, when the hallway was clear, “I need to know what you’ve been doing.”  
“You don’t wanna know, miss.”  
“It’s Rebecca, not miss. I’m not your boss, I’m just a bottom-rung secretary. Becca, even.”  
“You don’t wanna know, miss Becca,” he repeated, “they’re cruel people. You don’t need to see that stuff.”  
“See what stuff?”  
“Nothing. There’s nothing to see.”  
My fingers gripped his shoulder, firmly, insistent,  
“Walt, if they’re doing something awful, I need to see it, so I can report it. I appreciate you protecting me, I really do. But if I want to resolve this situation, I need *evidence* of what they’ve been doing, not just suspicions.”  
He thought about that for a minute, his expression unreadable, as if he was listening to something. Then, with an abrupt nod, he headed down the corridor, beckoning for me to follow. In the janitor’s cupboard near the elevators, he gestured to the waste-paper bin beside the door.  
“It’s all in there.”  
Amongst the innocent rubbish were several balls of printed paper, tightly wadded up by Walt’s strong old hands. Smoothing them out on the low table against the wall, I clenched my teeth as I viewed the images.  
It seemed my sister hadn’t been happy just spilling my gender history to Deb; she’d also furnished the sour old woman with intimate and painful photos from my teens – all with my old name and cartoon penises scrawled over them.  
Balling them up in my fists, I threw the printouts back into the basket.  
“People have done worse,” I whispered.  
“They’re gonna do worse,” Walt replied, his walnut face screwed up with concern, “this place, this building, it’s got *history*.”  
But when I pressed him for more information, he shut down. The fear and shame I glimpsed in his eyes before he looked away reminded me of myself, and his hands shook as he hustled me out of the cupboard.

   
The chemical smell in the cubicle was strong and strange, but I couldn’t pinpoint it. Everything seemed in order on my desk, no more images had been taped to my monitor and chair.  
When Deb arrived half an hour later, her shriek of surprise and rage startled me so thoroughly that I knocked over my coffee and smacked my knee on my desk drawers.  
“YOU did this!” the woman shrilled, waving her hands at me above the divider. Her fingers were stained red. “You fucking did this, and I’ll see you fired for it, you *pervert!*”  
Curious, I braved the furnace of irrational ire and walked around to her desk,  
“What exactly have I done?”  
But before she could splutter out any more insults, I saw for myself. Someone had slashed the seat of her office chair, through the fabric and deep into the foam, then poured a bottle of red ink into the gash. Ink which had soaked into Deb’s skirt and stained her legs as she sat down, unaware.  
“Is this some kind of jealous tranny retaliation?” she squawked, waving her red hands in my face.  
“Retaliation for *what*?” I retorted hotly, colour rising in my face, “I’ve taken everything you people have thrown at me with grace and patience, yet *you* are accusing *me* of being the bad guy?”  
“Pack your desk,” Deb snarled, “you’ll be gone by the end of the day.”

   
The HR manager looked uncomfortable as I sat, not meeting my eye. I waited patiently as he read through the statement from Deb, which she had of course embellished for maximum effect. When he was done, I calmly refuted the inaccurate details, and explained that I hadn’t vandalised any office property.  
“Well, nobody else had any motivation to do it,” the manager said, still avoiding looking at me directly.  
“And what motivation did *I* have to do it?” I countered.  
He shifted in his seat, glancing everywhere but at me.  
“Deborah Young claims that she, ah, discovered that someone had vandalised your desk. Late last night, after you left.”  
“How was it vandalised?”  
Surprised, he blinked at me, actually looking at my face for the first time since I sat down.  
“Well, you must have seen it.”  
I squinted at him,  
“Seen what? My desk was perfectly normal when I came in.”  
He blustered. “I find that hard to believe.”  
“Why? Why do you find that hard to believe? What the hell happened to my desk?”  
“No need to be so *aggressive*, Joh-ah-Rebecca,” he managed, barely correcting himself.  
“Did you *seriously* just call me my old name?”  
He blanched,  
“That was an honest mistake.”  
I sighed, already letting it go. This was a battle I couldn’t win, no matter how unfair it was.  
“Just tell me what was wrong with my desk, so we can get this shit-show over with.”  
The manager swallowed, picking his words carefully now,  
“On your desk is a plush toy dog, yes?”  
“Blue. From Blue’s Clues. My boyfriend gave her to me.”  
“The toy had, ah, been cut open. At the… crotch. And a, ah, plastic phallus had been inserted.”  
Summoning everything I had, I kept my face completely neutral.  
“You mean a dildo. Someone cut Blue open and put a dildo in her.”  
“Yes.”  
What I had wasn’t enough. The anger rose like a tidal wave, massive and unstoppable; but instead of breaking in a torrent of destruction and violence, it collapsed, flooding out of me in a wash of hot, shameful tears. As I sobbed, eyes blurred from salt and sorrow, the HR manager must have made a hasty exit, leaving me alone, clutching the edge of the table until I cried myself dry.

   
Walt shook his head as I showed him the meticulously stitched plush toy, the needlework so perfect it looked like a natural seam.  
“Wasn’t me,” he said, gaze darting nervously, “can’t sew. Never saw it.”  
Looking at his grizzled hands, I had no doubt he was telling the truth; Walt couldn’t have threaded a needle to save his life.  
“Then who, Walt? Everyone else here hates my guts.”  
“Can’t say miss. Can’t say.”  
Something told me there was more to this. *Someone* had fixed the vandalised toy, then retaliated by attacking Deb’s chair.  
*”Maybe the office ghost doesn’t like you,”* I remembered Deb sneering.  
“Walt. You said this place had history. You said that after I saw the pictures. What did you mean by that?”  
His eyes drifted to the staircase like he was planning an escape.  
“Nothing. I meant nothing.”  
“*Who* is helping me, Walt? Because if they carry on like this, they’ll get me fired, and I *need* this job. People like me don’t get jobs like this. People like me aren’t supposed to succeed.”  
“I know.” There was agony in his voice. “But I can’t say.”  
Frustrated, I left the little man to his work, determined to figure it out myself.

   
My second meeting with HR was called because of Deb’s car. Someone had smashed the rear window, and poured what appeared to be pig’s blood over the back seat. Her car was parked within camera range in the basement carpark, but there had been a convenient CCTV ‘buffer overflow error’ for ten minutes, right around when the event had occurred.  
“I’d left work by then,” I told the HR manager, “and if I’d come back into the building, there would be a security record of it. Pull my swipecard logs, if you haven’t already.”  
He started speaking over me, but I cut him off,  
“Yes, I’m aware that Deb was my secret Santa, and that’s why I got beard oil, a voucher for a male-only sauna and a pair of festive-print Y-fronts. Regardless, even if that counts as ‘motivation’ to vandalise her car, I wasn’t in the building, and there’s no evidence I did it.”  
I stood and put my hand on the door handle,  
“You know, this is pretty serious. I find it odd that she hasn’t gone to the police about it, don’t you?”  
He didn’t try to stop me as I left.

   
The tension in the air within our cubicle was so thick that it felt like working in molasses. Every sound was amplified by paranoia, every movement scrutinised surreptitiously. The corners of everyone’s eyes were getting a real workout. I wanted to scream at them that *they* had caused this situation, that if they’d just *left me the fuck alone*, we could all at least *pretend* to be professionals and just do our damn jobs without their bigotry overshadowing everything.  
If I thought it would have made a difference, I would have done exactly that; but experience had already taught me people like this didn’t respond to reason, that they didn’t have empathy for anyone who wasn’t like them. I would ride this bullshit out until it was resolved one way or another.  
The email from Walt caught me by surprise – I wasn’t even aware he was computer literate, or that he had access to a computer. I felt shame when I realised my own assumptions were showing.  
*Meet me on the seventh floor in 10 minutes,* the email said, *go through the door on the left stairwell. I’ll tell you everything you want to know.*  
Reading, then re-reading the message, I hit the delete icon and emptied the recycle bin.  
The seventh floor wasn’t occupied, as far as I knew. The company owned it, but it had lain unused for so long that renovations would now cost far more than the office space was worth. There were rumours that something had happened there, a long time ago, but it was all hearsay – nobody could back up any of the wild claims about the seventh floor.  
But Walt might know. The man was seventy if he was day.

   
I wasn’t surprised when my spare swipe card allowed me through the paint-flaked door and into the derelict gloom of the seventh floor space. Cables hung from the roof, darkly curled like rotting tentacles, and piles of insulation foam clustered against the walls in curious drifts. Heaps of broken chairs and rolls of ancient carpet lurked amongst other scattered, skeletal furniture and sagging wooden shelves.  
There was no sign of Walt, but a dim light shone from a dirty-windowed office, partitioned from the main floor space by naked chipboard walls and mildewed sacking.  
“Walt?” I called as I pushed open the water-damaged door.  
What hit me, I’m not sure, but the next thing I remember was trying to pick myself up from the rotten carpet, pain roaring in my skull and wrist. A crushing weight came down on my chest, and I realised someone was on top of me – Mark, by the size and smell of him; he always wore the same shitty cheap cologne.  
Pinning my wrists, he looped plastic cable ties around them and pulled tight, while a voice protested from the gloom – Walt’s voice.  
“You said you weren’t gonna hurt her. You said this was just to talk,” he said thickly.  
“Well, I don’t see any *her* in this room other than me,” Deb said nastily, “just you, Mark and this cock in a frock.”  
“I don’t have a cock,” I shot back miserably.  
“A mutilated cock is still a cock.”  
The anger swelled like a balloon, but receded as I shut my eyes and willed reason to take over.  
“What do you want from me?”  
Mark propped me up against the damp wall, none too gently.  
“A confession,” Deb said, “You’re going to state that you did all those things and we’re going to record it, then send it through to the CEO’s office and the police.”  
“Good luck with that,” I spat.  
“How hard do you think it would be for us to put a noose over one of these beams and hang you? Everyone will think you did it yourself. The suicide rate for you freaks is through the fucking roof; and it’s not like your loving family would investigate, now is it?”  
“Just confess,” Mark growled, “you can fuck off and find another job.”  
I shook my head,  
“I’m in the right here. *I didn’t do anything wrong!* You people are the monsters, harassing an innocent person because of your own shitty prejudices.”  
Walt moved for the door, but Deb closed it, holding the handle.  
“And we know *your* secret too, Walter Sawyer. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why you never married, never had kids, and why you’re so sympathetic to this ugly *shemale*.”  
The air seemed to *ripple* for a moment as she spoke the slur. Walt saw me notice it, too, and closed his eyes, but it appeared that none of the others registered the odd sensation.  
Mark thrust his cellphone in my face.  
“Say that you did it all. Confess to all the crap you pulled, then we can all get out of this shithole and go home.”  
Fixing my gaze on his hateful face, I spoke a single word.  
“No.”  
Shaking his head, Mark put down his phone.  
“Deb, get the rope.”  
As the last word left his mouth, the air swam again, as though the entire floor was filled with breathable fluid. Lights flickered and flashed in the rippling atmosphere and Deb cried out in fear as something fundamental *changed* in the fabric of the seventh floor.

   
Deb was still Deb, but she was also a young man, dressed in orange and brown, his bushy hairstyle as archaic as his clothing. She/he danced with Mark, who was also young, slender and long-haired, nothing like himself apart from a certain gleam of terror about the eyes. Their hips ground into each other as they gyrated to the heavy funk of music that belonged to another era. Around them the ghosts of other dancers – all male – moved with abandon, safe in a place that allowed them to be who they were, in a time when their kind was utterly condemned.  
But they weren’t safe, and I knew it. I knew it because I knew who I was, and what I was. I was there to ensure that places like this didn’t exist, and my badge, my uniform and my gun all meant I could do what I wanted here. They screamed like women when they saw my pistol, and I laughed at the faggots, revelling in the stink of their sweaty fear in the air.  
I told them to get up against the fucking wall and they did; the queers and the sissies. The ones dressed as women I told to take their clothes off and they did as they were told, crying like babies. Well, all but one.  
The narrative of my real self, bolstered by stories, yes, but built from knowledge and pain and truth, thrashed and fought against the alien mind I was occupying. I heard the voice of the police officer – my voice – yell at the offender to take off his dress.  
“No.” The sissy said, eyes so bright and defiant and beautiful and… revolting.  
The rage that flooded through me was far beyond anything that could be controlled. It was irrational, it was potent and it was unstoppable – the righteous rage of a person who had never really been told ‘no’. Someone who never needed to be careful with their truth, who had never wanted in life; someone who had never been dismissed as garbage for simply *being*.  
The trigger was light under my finger and the blossom of red from the groin of the sissy filled me with such heady elation that for a moment, I stared at my pistol in wonder. Screams rent the air and the faggots ran for the door of the gay speakeasy, sobbing in terror. Two huddled under a table – Deb and Mark ghosted through them – and I kicked the table over before shooting them again and again, until my gun was empty.  
Out in the stairwell I could still hear them, running and shrieking, and I followed, baton in hand. A young man in overalls ran into me, raising his arms defensively as I turned on him.  
“I’m just a janitor!” he squawked, “My name’s Walt Sawyer. I-I work on the eighth floor.”  
“You saw nothing,” I told him, as I pressed my empty gun to his neck, “you hear me? And if you ever tell anyone you saw me here, I’ll hunt you down. I’ll *ruin* you in ways you can’t even imagine.”  
I saw the light of decision dawn in his brown eyes just a fraction too late. In that moment, he changed his story forever, and ended mine.  
The world upended as Walt’s strong young hands pushed me down the stairs. The last sound I heard was the horrifying crunch of my neck snapping on the risers as they rose to meet me, and as awareness faded, the whole scene rippled again, the air fluid and nauseating, rank with the stench of urine and blood.

   
What was left of my breakfast came up quickly, splattering the fetid carpet. Walt was beside me, cutting off the cable ties with a pocket knife, apologising over and over. Curled up on the floor beside each other were Mark and Deb, the former shivering uncontrollably and the latter whimpering like a dying animal.  
We left them where they lay and stumbled out of that place, the ghosts of the massacre still clinging to us, the personas not wanting to give up their temporary flesh, even now their truths had been heard. The officer’s phantom hatred burned like a virus in my soul; the antithesis of everything I’d ever been and wanted to be. Walt seemed lost in his own recollections, of his own actions that night, barely responding when I pushed him up the stairs and back to the sanity of the eighth floor.  
In the bathroom I cleaned myself up as much as I could, trembling hands blotting away mascara, quivering lips slowly stilling as I bathed my wrists in cool water. I knew that whatever happened, one way or another, my time in this place was coming to an end.  
Holding my head as high as I could and straightening my skirt, I walked out of the bathroom, back into the office, and sat at my desk.  
Deb’s cubicle was empty, and so was Mark’s.

 

 

Deborah Young was found dead in her apartment three days later, several empty pill bottles beside her bed, and her rigid face a blue-black rictus of agony. Mark hadn’t returned to work, but he officially resigned the day we all found out about the suicide. Trina and I watched with mixed emotions as Walt cleared out both of their desks. He didn’t look at me, but his strong hands no longer shook; they were steady and sure as he taped shut the boxes that contained all that remained of my workmates’ time in this place.  
“I’m sorry I didn’t do much,” Trina explained, her lip quivering, “I tried to say they should leave you alone, but they wouldn’t listen.” She leaned in, glancing at Walt and lowering her voice like she was divulging a secret. “I think you’re really lovely.”  
“It doesn’t matter,” I soothed her, “they’re gone now. They can’t do any more harm.”  
Mark’s parting gift was a confession – not mine, but his. He admitted to all the harassment, and more – awful things I wasn’t even aware of, things which had inexplicably and impossibly been cleaned up before I’d even seen them. And not by Walt Sawyer. I brought an employment suit against the company and settled for a sum that I can’t disclose, though I *can* tell you that it was more than enough for me to go back to school and start my *own* business.  
We’re tiny, and there’s a hell of a lot of work to do, but once I’ve finished my degree, look me up if you ever need a human rights lawyer. Or if you need really bad jokes from a really good janitor, one who’s just like a Dad. Walt’s on the payroll for life – and our new office has no stairs.  
I wish the story ended there, that this wholesome fade-to-black is where we cut to the credits, but for those of you that want to sit through to the cut scene at the end, there is more.  
I know exactly what Deb and Mark felt.  
I know why *she* killed herself. And I know why *he* became a homeless alcoholic, begging for booze money on Main Street. The feelings they had when they were inside those two young gay men – the unending terror and pain – wouldn’t go away. They would *never* go away, not with drink, nor with therapy. It would only end with their own deaths.  
Just as the feelings I’d felt while I was the police officer won’t ever leave me.  
The righteous anger lurks in the dark, waiting. It whispers that with a gun in my hand, with enough power, I can do *anything*. I can get away with murder, so long as I kill the right people. But even more than that, it remembers what it felt like to take a life of someone you have every right to hate *absolutely*, and the heady, intoxicating rush that comes with it. It tells me that if I kill just *one* person, my thirst will be quenched, and for a while I can go back to being normal, to who I was before. To just being Becca.  
I saw Mark yesterday, sleeping outside McDonalds, a tattered hat in his hand and a cardboard sign beside his head, begging for change. Ever since I saw him, there’s a picture in my head; my hand putting a gun to his stomach and pulling the trigger, until the gun is empty.  
I really struggled to know why the ghost of the seventh floor put me in the shoes of the cop, why I was chosen to contain the memory of him. But I think I’ve finally figured it out.  
Anyone else would have given in to the hatred by now. It would have taken them over – and the mistakes of that night in the 60s would have been repeated, over and over, echoing through the ages, turning story after story into a tragedy, until its power finally faded to nothing.  
But I already knew how to live with hate. I know how to rewrite it.  
You might think it’s not fair, that I’ve already had enough struggles in my life. But this is a burden I will willingly bear.

Trying to figure out if my future space should have a dark tv console (which i already own) or a lighter one (will buy on FB marketplace). Sofa will be light grey and my bar stools are also a light grey. Sorry for the terrible images! Hope you can help, I know it's not a lot to work with. I love the MCM look of the white tv stand (being marketed as a coffee table), but I think it's not as functional as a tv stand with shelves (will need space for playstation, switch, bin for controls, etc.) unless I find another way to place those items. The black unit I already have, but wasn't sure if it would darken the space too much.

Just because a man is financially spoiling you doesn't mean he's immune to cheating? He could have lesser means and be loyal and vice-versa? It's just BASIC COMMON SENSE. 

She has an over inflated ego and she really thought she's above the girl he cheated on with her. Add to that her gross gold digger mentality and you get a recipe for disaster. She has a very superficial and distorded world view and now her <3 mOtHeR <3 fans are so inspired by her crashing out like this when it's giving freak show!!

Then her telling them have your own finances and go to college it's giving failed regretful loser mom and it's so performative for someone who used men since she was 19 being flown out to Dubai.

Now suddenly all these girls don't want to go on coffee dates and want their rich provider husband and girl howwwww are you going to get him lol. These girls are totally gullible and NOT prepared for the game AT ALL and influencers like her are building their platforms and earning their money through deviating these naive girls and not telling them the full, harsh truth like yeah just manifest your rich habibi and he's gonna come and you can't achieve my beauty standard because it's just accutane and water and sleep and sheet masks and manifestation <3

Is this a simulation?,"So. for some background context here, I will be the first to tell you, I am healthy, I dont have much wrong with me! But, once I get into this I am sure everyone will tell me I was fooling myself, but being ignorant has been blissfull.

I am 40. I turn 41 next week. until last week, the only time I had ever been to a hospital was to have a baby, and never once visited an urgent care in my life. I would get an occasional sinus infection or UTI and I would just go to the doctor and get antibiotics and go along with my life.

Here's where we back up slightly to I'm actually not healthy, but fooled myself. I was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma about 20 years ago, and after years of doing MRI's and taking medication, there was no change in the tumor, so I just stopped taking care of it. It didnt really cause me any issues that I couldnt deal with.

For about a month now I have just felt... ""off"". I thought maybe it had something to do with about a year ago I decided I didnt want to be obese anymore, so I started eating right, exercising and started taking Wegovy. I am not yet to a ""healthy"" weight per the charts and all that, but i feel better. But I had gotten to where i might forget to eat some days. So I was thinking that off feeling was low blood sugar, low electrolytes what have you. Last thursday I was at work, and someone mentioned I didnt look so great, i said, yeah, I'm tired. just not feeling it today. so we went through our meeting, and when it was over, i got up and promptly sat back down. I am not sure what other people seen, but my boss told me, go to urgent care, go right now. I said nah. i'm fine. I'll just finish my coffee and take a minute and then I'll get going. a co worker said, maybe you need to put the coffee down, you have been having more and more busy spells over the last year or so. I said. no i'm good. my boss said. I just clocked you out. I dont want to see you until you've been cleared by a doctor. Well. thats the kick in the pants i needed i guess.

I drove myself the 2 miles to the nearest urgent care, told them, i think i just blacked out and my boss wants me checked out before i go back to work. within moments i was hooked up for an EKG and I had people in my face asking me to do the most ridiculous things, felt like I was having a roadside sobriety test. The provider at the urgent care said, your vitals are all normal, but something isnt right, i think this has to do with the brain tumor thats in your chart that you didnt mention. I said, yeah, thats nothing, hasnt caused me an issue for a long time. can i go now? she said no, you are going to the emergency room. I get to the emergency room and they already have the order to do an MRI on my tumor. about the time i get wheeled out of the MRI my husband is showing up. the rudest doctor ive ever met in my life comes over and says, well your tumor shrunk but you should have told us you have MS.

My husbands soul left his body in that moment, and I am ignorant. I was like. I dont have MS. I have a tumor, and I got lightheaded and blacked out at work. He said no you have MS. you didnt know you have MS? my husband said, is it possible its something else besides MS? I said what the heck is MS? the doctor said no its definitely MS she has lesions all over her brain and they are in the areas where it is only MS nothing else, and shes actively flaring right now. she needs to be admitted for 5 days minimum. I said, Im not being admitted. nope. I have my sons graduation party on saturday and I am not missing that, if i have to walk out of here against doctors orders. 

well over the course of thursday night and friday i talked them into letting me go home and have my sons graduation party, they put me on high dose oral steroids. Monday was my last day of steroids, and as the week has pushed on I feel my cognitive function is just not quite right. I have a bunch of appointments coming up, some are scheduled out until next year. How do I not get something (that i still dont really know what it is) looked at and treated for a year? I dont know what I am supposed to be doing with myself, what should i eat, what should i drink, im messing up at work, i am not comfortable driving, thank goodness work is letting me work mostly from home.

OK first room I got told yesterday. Congratulations for getting engaged. Keep in mind. I’m not I’m single as F. Secondly, there’s been a car in my name and I got a call yesterday about it, but I can’t even drive due to an invisible disability. Next rumor is third one is that my mom and my friend‘s mom had a one night stand With my crush of five years who I met during Covid on Instagram. I have found out that there is a fake profile on Facebook pretending to be me and it’s not me. It is actually my mother I kid you not I’m not making this up. Short story I drove 3 miles to meet the man 40 m after not speaking to him after five years because I’m on a closure and I Uber out to see him. First words out of his mouth after five years were can you come to my house? I drove 3 miles and 30 minutes to his house crazy shit for love, right. Keep in mind my dad’s my guardian shirts, pants purses dresses have been showing up on thread up and they were actually my stuff. I want to get married when I’m older to the right person. I find out that there is a 31K a college fund left for me, but it was actually given to my cousin Jessica who I hate for all this holy. Last year, Jessica almost got me tossed and made my life a living. Hell she is my dad‘s cousin and she is always been a bit of a prick. The other thing that is pissing me off as I have to hear these rumors at a retail job I work with my crushes family of five years so they come up to me. Rumor one was congratulations on getting married me lol I’m not married. I’m single. Rumor two was that my own parents were using my credit card with a hard earned money that I use so I look this up if a guardian uses award money without their permission that the word earns on their own at both jobs. It is considered fraud now there’s charges for $100 on my card. I did not spend $100 on walk on the beach. The other rumor was that I’m parked and it’s I’m not I saw with my own eyes that my friends’s mom made a grownup s tape using my own personal belongings with my crush for five years her daughter‘s behavior has become a bit of dominant and a bully people are starting to talk shit about me at work saying on true rumors and lies about it. One of the things is is that where I work you’re not allowed to gossip or slander another coworker work is being so uncomfortable to the point I wanna quit. I work at a coffee shop full of disabled adults. First job second job is retail for clarification. Not so much I looked over the credit card charges today and there has been charges to places I don’t even shop or go to. Keep in mind also my childhood friend of five years her family has always been while money hungry and they took advantage of me for cash. I am so tired of people fake apologizing to me. My friend‘s mom says well why don’t you come over to our house and hang out with H? I said well it depends on my work schedule in theory. I do not feel comfortable answering their house because she called the cops on my birthday be I don’t trust her mom. She acts like an immature child. She suffers bipolar disorder my best. He has even said it makes her feel uncomfortable to even be around her own mom. my parents met in high school and been married for 50 years so it’s kinda hard to believe that my own mom would have an affair.with my crush of five years. Also dresses, clothing, purses have been disappearing for my room. There’s also another rumor flowing around the fifth one, but there’s another girl impersonating me and trying to be me make up wise clothing, wise, hairstyle wise, and everything you can ever think it was even brought to my attention that she got married under my name and I’m not even married so how can I find out the truth? Also take it with the green assault that the guy of five years wanted guardianship of me, but I’m questionable to even give it to him because I’m afraid he wants to use me for cash and that’s just my gut feeling keep in mind. I’m an empath which means I sense things before it happens. They keep calling me into the office at my other job to tell me all the stuff these rumors of what people are saying, why can’t people just be freaking honest with me and come say it to my face and why do two grown women have to act like two freaking mean girls in high school and bully a disabled invisible adult Without invisible disability to find out my own mom and my friend’s mom would act this way is an excusable and disgusting behavior. There is also a bank account under my name, but it’s not even at the bank that I go to. I found this out from phone calls that looked like spam and they’re not spam. I also found out my crush of five years might be in trouble and the person you told to protect me as my friend h took advantage of me and is currently dating my online crush of five years who 40m . How are you all this was happening to you to find out your own mom bullied you and her friend’s mom as well who is also kind of dominant in a bully. This is my fifth time being bullied and blackmailed. I also feel pissed off because this guy of five years who I spent my last paycheck on because I have a big heart and I’m kind of sleeping with my own mom and my friend‘s mom which is kind of gross and away because my mom is married.

and I’ve noticed something…

Many who reference it in conversations about faith have only seen the series—
few have read the book.

But the book is different.
Quieter.
More layered.
And not quite the attack some assume it to be.

It’s not really about Christianity.
It’s about what happens when power hijacks belief
when sacred words are twisted into chains instead of keys.

The Jesus I know doesn’t dominate or control.
He heals.
He listens.
He lifts the head of the broken and says,
“You are free.”

It’s easy to blame God for what people have misused.
But the Gospel I carry in my bones?
It’s mercy.
It’s justice rooted in love.
It’s holiness that never needed control to be holy.

“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he has anointed me
to proclaim good news to the poor.
He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives
and recovering of sight to the blind,
to set at liberty those who are oppressed…”Luke 4:18 - Jesus

Ingredients:

\-200g dairy milk chocolate

\-200g butter

\-125ml coffee

\-3 eggs

\-75ml buttermilk (made by mixing lemon juice and milk)

\-85g self raising flour

\-85g plain flour

\-1/4 tsp bicarb

\-200g muscovado sugar

\-200g caster sugar

\-25g cocoa powder

  
So far I've only mixed the wet ingredients, but I strayed a little bit from the original recipe. The recipe called for dark chocolate, but my local shop sold out so I had to settle for milk chocolate. I was thinking about reducing the amount of sugar later in the recipe and increasing the amount of cocoa to balance it out, would that work?

Also, the original recipe had me melt the butter, chocolate and coffee together in a pan and mix the buttermilk and eggs seperately before combining them at the same time in the dry ingredients, but since I wanted to do the wet ingredients first I mixed the melted mixture and the egg mixture together and have left it to sit overnight, but I'm worried I may have messed it up.

The main thing I'm worried about is that the cake will be overly moist and be like a dense brick, but i've not added the dry ingredients yet so I honestly can't tell, I just don't want to waste lots of flour, sugar nd cocoa.

Part of it is because of super busy schedules and part of it is poor communication about our needs. The biggest part of it, however, is that there’s been a lot of conflict, which makes me feel like we aren’t emotionally close, he always tries to initiate by groping me, even when I’ve said I need slower initiation and a bit of romance, and the fact that he will treat me like a roommate all week and then try to wake me up for intimacy when he wants it, without even telling me I’m pretty. 

He’s recently expressed that he needs more physical intimacy, and I agreed, offering suggestions on how we could build that connection. Later that week, I initiated, bought a new set of lingerie, the works. I clearly expressed what I was and was not comfortable with before we began and he proceeded to ask me for the one thing I said was off the table that night (because we didn’t have protection) at least 9 times. Afterwards, I told him how coercive and pressuring that felt, especially considering my history with trauma in that department and he basically told me that he didn’t do anything wrong by expressing his desire and he didn’t know how we could have an intimate life if I was just going to be “triggered every time” (mind you I’ve only had two panic attacks about things like that in our 3.5 year relationship). I told him we needed to work on trust and communication before I’d feel comfortable to regularly incorporate physical intimacy into our relationship again. 

A week later, he tells me that he thinks I’ve become a financial burden and he resents me for it. Now, up until this point he had put in a lot of work to convince me to be comfortable with him spending money on me at all. He would constantly tell me that this is a partnership and since he makes three times what I do, he’s happy to pay for dates, buy me coffee, etc. It took me YEARS to be comfortable with that. Even now, I don’t ask him for things but if we are going out with his friends I do expect him to pay for me or allow me to stay home since i can’t always pay for myself. Now, however, he’s saying I’m a financial burden and entitled, even though he’s never expressed discomfort with our dynamic. Money is something I’m super conscious of and he knows I’m really sensitive about the idea of being a burden so I apologized and told him I would be more communicative about funds before we did anything. 

The next day, he points out a $200 collection of books I’m looking at and asks if I want. I told him it wasn’t something I had the money for so I was just admiring it. He then tells me that he’ll buy it for me if I give him a blow job. I tried to laugh it off but he kept pushing it until I firmly told him no and to leave it alone. Later that night, he suggested that he’ll start canceling Venmo charges he’s made to me if I do sexual favors for him. I was completely floored. Not only did it really hurt that he would rather treat me, his fiancé, like a sex worker (no shade to sex work) than actually rebuild our intimacy but it made me angry because it felt like he brought all of that money stuff up to try and manipulate me into doing this. When I told him it felt gross and manipulative he told me he just thinks that if he gives me financial incentive, I’ll be “more inclined to say yes” when I’m on the fence or will “at least pretend to want it.” I’ve never felt more disrespected by my partner. It really feels like he doesn’t see me as an equal at all anymore. 
Is this even worth coming back from? How could we repair this? At this point, he kind of feels like someone I don’t know at all.

Well I have and let me tell you, it’s amazing! I wish I had bought more than one bag! I’ve searched everywhere to see where they sell it, and I can’t find it!

1kynddr,https://i.redd.it/dzfso01ols3f1.jpeg,FAR Dump sheet - worked for me,"Hi, 

Wanted to share my dump sheet approach I used for FAR  a few weeks back in case it’ll inspire anyone else’s. 

While I recognize you can’t “dump sheet” your way thru the whole exam - I’m a visual learner and this proved to be a great grounding exercise in the 5 mins before the start of the exam. 

It consists of 2 main things:

1) government funds mnemonic, with supplementary info for accrual basis and fund focus

2) journal entry chart which also helps illustrate the balance sheet relationship, income statement relationship and retained earnings -> net income relationship. Hey, I get it’s Level 1 stuff but when you’re in the heat of the moment, I liked having my little key with me during AJE. 

What I did was trace this out every time I did an MCQ set - so it was muscle memory when I got into exam day. And during commercial break for sporting events, before bed, with morning coffee….you get it. 

There may have been a few other mnemonics on there but they were so fleeting I already forgot what they were. 

I took FAR 2 weeks ago and passed. This directly helped on maybe 7-8 questions. It may have been what got me over the line - so hope it can help someone else. ",5,1748555646.0,CPA,2,1.0,False

I am a recent graduate and part of me believes that maybe I am not putting my resume in places where it would most succeed due to my limited experience. Taking a look at how my resume is now, is there any particular industries or job titles you believe would be a good fit? While I do have an interest in working in the test software side of audio (think Bose for example), as a recent graduate I understand I have to be open on what my first job will be. Also, while I am based in NY, I am willing to relocate if the opportunities in the specified industry are concentrated elsewhere. If there is a subreddit better suited to this type of question, please let me know!

1kyn9ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1kyn9ns/i_am_so_sad_because_i_am_not_my_ideal_self_enough/,"I am so sad because I am not my ""ideal self"" enough","Im a 19 yo trans male with autism.
 Since puberty Ive based my entire self worth on being a certain way, and it coincided with the rather hurtful comments my brother gave me my entire adolescence. The exact root cause, I do not know.
But what I can say with certainty is that my mental health spiralled dramatically after I tried making a youtube channel late 2024 (now deleted).
This is how this excrutiating mental health spiral commenced (the other significant factor was the final encounter I had with my brother in November 2024, when I seen my aunt with him in the sticks. His hair and clothes put mine to shame, he easily beaten her at checkers despite having no prior knowledge at all, he was as quiet as a mouse making the other three people look like ""sims"" in comparison, he hadn't eaten anything all day other than 1 brown bread bagel (aunt was concerned, I was jealous but I didn't want to tell him that) I remember how when the car stopped at McDonalds when the adults gotten food of a kind my brother would vomit at I wanted coffee or tea with milk in but I didn't want to because of my brother, when we were waiting in the house and I told him about a funny ugly weird looking book that our stepdad would read he was like ""I didn't even notice it"" (I am not that abstracted), and the sort of text messages he sent me at the time were extremely sensitive.
I recorded videos of myself speaking to the camera about myself, my past, whatever it is I think about and gives me nostalgia, my brothers' vocabulary ""simlike"" and ""sluglike"", trying to establish coincidences between my dreams and waking life, etc. Initially I loved doing it, but it really did take a downward spiral because of the kind of comments the channel received.
There was this one recurring commenter, I think they were the significant cause of the spiral.
""Red bull and diet coke makes me gag, I only drink water and black coffee""
""I spend a lot of time daydreaming, I get lost in my own world so much and I fail to notice what is right in front of me""
""What happens if you don't like the way someone is dressed? Do you lash out at them?""
They would also send me emails enquiring me about my diet or religious views, in a way that made me feel very ashamed. And also emails of their otherworldly looking art, complaining ""I don't want vague responses such as ' just liking the colours ' "". I can't tell if that really is the case or if it was just a troll.
At the same time, some completely different account (by the looks of it) responded with ""Get a boyfriend"" and did not believe me at all when I responded that I am an asexual transgender male with autism. I also remember trying to explain something using a metaphor but everyone poked logical holes in it. Of course I was beyond upset.

things that give me type dysphoria:
-not being able to regulate my emotions
-needing emotional support from others
-caring too much
-saying things without thinking
-rarely daydreaming
-being too open about my personal life and emotional issues
-being overly serious
-not being able to be fully satisfied with my physical appearance
-having poor hygiene
-crying very loud
-being told to ""calm down""
-eating too much sweet food

Basically fundamentally my self worth depends on being as asexual, neurodivergent, low bmi, minimalistic, nonchalant, unemotional. dissociated, sarcastic, androgynous as possible (but at the same time there is also a part of me that finds said mentality extremely cringe/embarrassing- like for example just compare Aphex Twin with idk like hardcore punk or grime or something. Think about how uncomfortable it is to <want> to be a doomer, for crying out loud). Being too much the opposite for whatever reason results in unbearable distress. I remember my brother speaking about how fat girly vulnerable etc I was, especially in comparison to him.

It gets so extreme I feel uncomfortable in public, getting triggered over the mildest of things that prove I am not ""ideal self"" (e.g. strangers commenting on undue negative emotional affect, or getting onto a bus way before everyone else) enough. Overhearing people talk about horror films, russia, weed use etc is triggering.
I remember when I were younger how jealous Id get whenever someone was really good at maths or had deep conversations or something, like way more than other character traits.

Its like the less control I have over my emotions, the more outbursts I have, the ""fatter"" I feel, even though its kinda silly.",2,1748555379.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

A lot of people think AI is going to do all the work. But the truth is, AI is just leverage. It’s a tool. You still have to show up, think clearly, and solve real problems.

I tell all my students this.

Start by being useful. If you’re focused on how to help others save time, grow their business, or get results, the money will follow. Don’t chase shortcuts. Build trust, improve your skill, and deliver value.

It doesn’t need to be complicated. Start with something simple you can offer today. Package it well. Use AI to speed up the parts that slow you down. But keep your human touch. People buy from people.

Lastly, be patient with yourself. This takes time. You’ll get faster, sharper, and more confident. But only if you keep showing up.

This community is here to support you. I’ll teach you everything I know, and I’ll give you real systems that work. You just have to put them to use.",1,1748555365.0,swiss_academy_club,0,1.0,False

I’m 29 years old male and I just recently about 3 weeks ago went through a break up with my ex gf who I lived with and dated for about 6 months, since I’m single I decided to travel to Europe since I’ve never really been and I had some friends in Germany and one of them was this girl I used to see from Costa Rica and we would intimate and sleep together and travel but we never were officially bf/gf. So where I grew up and how I grew up which was by a single mom who was an alcoholic, my dad over dosed on drugs when I was 12 and didn’t have many male role models around I always just thought a man pays for a woman’s dinner and everything else basically, so after my breakup that girl from Costa Rica messages me and we had spoke a little before when me and gf had mini breakups and I said I might travel to Spain and she messages me the day after my breakup and i ask her if she wants to come with me to Spain and she says yes, I pay for her plane ticket from Germany and it’s around 400$ book us the Airbnb which is around 1200$ and pay for a few tours for us which is around 400$ for both of us, we spent a few days together in Germany since I went there after Amsterdam cuz we agreed to fly together and we got good in Germany and she said thank you so much when I booked the tour for us and I made a joke but was serious “your welcome you owe me a coffee” just showing appreciation for all the money I spent since we aren’t bf/gf. She says “yes”. The first time we went to my Airbnb and we did have sex once and about 15 min later I try and have sex again but she says she wants to relax and I’m like okay, so in Germany for those 2 times we hangout we got matcha, dinner twice and I paid for everything. She did attempt to pay for the matcha the first day but they only took cash, so I paid. We then get to Spain and in the taxi she says “we need to talk” and when we get to the Airbnb she says she just wants to he friends and doesn’t feel a connection anymore and doesn’t want sex. I say okay and we talk about it we don’t have sex but now I feel taken advantage of, not because I expect sex from a woman but this girl isn’t my friend we were ex lovers and I thought we would maybe form some type of relationship, I don’t buy plane tickets for friends. I just feel so weird now and stupid, she offered to leave and get her own place but I’m really generous and nice and I say no it’s okay, she did buy dinner today but I still have paid for most things and all the expensive things. I’ve had conversations with people and they said you need to be clear on your intentions or whatever and it’s like I’m not going to tell someone “I want sex” i just thought it would click like it used to, I feel like I try and buy people maybe or a people pleaser, i don’t have much family or can’t get advice from my parents cuz my mom blocked me and is an alcoholic and can’t work and my dads dead, men my age what advice do you have for me?

Nothing crazy but it pays my bills and I actually enjoy it. A few months ago I finally saved up enough to buy a proper camera setup. I got a Sony A7 IV with a couple lenses and accessories. All in all it was about three grand, which was a huge investment for me. I didn’t finance it. I paid cash after months of saving and picking up side gigs.

Last weekend I had a few friends over to chill. Just some drinks and hanging out, nothing wild. My friend Ryan, who’s 24, brought two of his friends I don’t know super well. Everything was cool until Ryan started messing with my camera. It was set up on a tripod in the corner of the room because I was working on a project and needed the lighting right the next morning. I saw him pretending to vlog with one of his friends, walking around with the camera like it was a toy.

I told him, “Hey man please don’t mess with that, it’s expensive and I really need it.” He kinda laughed and said, “Relax, I got it.”

Not even five minutes later I heard a loud smack and saw the camera face down on the floor. He’d bumped into my coffee table and dropped it. The lens shattered, and the camera body doesn’t even turn on anymore. It’s completely wrecked.

I was honestly stunned. I didn’t yell right away but I told him straight up, “You need to help me pay for this.” He got defensive immediately and said it was an accident and I shouldn’t have left it out if it was that important. I told him that’s not the point. It’s my livelihood and he picked it up after I asked him not to.

We argued for a bit and he ended up leaving. He texted me the next day saying he’s sorry but he doesn’t have the money and that I should have insurance if I’m serious about being a professional. That pissed me off even more. Now I’m out thousands of dollars, had to cancel two gigs, and have no idea when I’ll be able to afford a new setup.

Some of our mutual friends are saying I’m being too intense and that it’s not like he did it on purpose. But to me, if you break something that isn’t yours, even by accident, you should take responsibility. Especially after being told not to touch it.

My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting someone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Playing the new Doom. Sad that Super Earth fell to the vile illuminate. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

**Chapter 2**





**On board the Supernova heavy freighter ""Gabriel"" en route to Jade Industries blacksite station. Four hours later.**



Chief Lockwood sat quietly in the freighter's crew lounge. The room was clean and well-furnished. The hum of the engines created a soft white noise that filled the silence.



Before him was a glowing datapad. His finger lightly scrolled through the manifest from the alien ship—various weapons, materials, equipment, and provisions. Some were of human origin, others completely foreign.

He had changed out of his black flight suit into more comfortable clothing: dark black camo pants, black boots, and a black hooded sweatshirt with a small Jack of Spades on the chest and the word “Chief” boldly printed across the back in white.

His hazel eyes scanned the datapad, its blue light illuminating his face. His hair was short, a mix of light brown and grey. He set the pad down on the table and took a sip of coffee. Leaning back, he reflected on the events of just a few hours prior. Nothing could have prepared him for what they had found.

Leo and Gideon were still in their ships, escorting the freighter to its destination. The mysterious man was secured in the infirmary under guard by six Marines.

His thoughts were interrupted by the soft hiss of the door sliding open. Footsteps approached slowly. He turned to see a much-needed familiar face.

She wore her usual black high-top canvas sneakers. The rest of her attire was more professional—black dress pants hugged her legs, and a dark grey turtleneck peeked out from beneath her white lab coat. Her skin was pale, freckled across the nose. Ice-blue eyes, framed by a messy bun of deep brown hair, met his.

“Amara. It's been a few months. How are you? How’ve things been on Chawla?” Chief Lockwood asked in a relaxed tone.

Standing with her hands in her lab coat pockets, she replied, “It has been a while, hasn't it? I'm doing well. The pirate attacks on various settlements have kept me busy, to put it lightly. Your men have been making great progress securing the planet. Shouldn't be too much longer.”

Her eyes studied his face. He looked happy, but she saw the exhaustion behind his eyes. His brown hair had more grey in it than last time. The chaos in the settled systems was starting to take its toll.

In a quieter tone, Ashton asked, “How’s Logan? Has his... condition improved?” His eyes searched for hope.

“I'm... afraid not, Ashton. We still haven’t deduced what it is. It hasn’t gotten worse, but it hasn’t gotten better. It hasn’t made his life easy these days.” Amara’s eyes held sadness—and guilt.

“I see. My work’s kept me away from HQ for a while. Once this mystery man situation is sorted out, I’ll visit before heading back to Luna.”

“That would be good. Logan would be happy to see you,” Amara said, offering a somber smile.

A subtle grin formed on Ashton’s face. Thoughts of his best friend and their history raced through his mind. Rubbing his eyes, he gestured to the seat beside him. Amara sat down, pulled out a notepad and glasses, then brushed her hair back behind one ear.

“Have you visited our mysterious guest yet?”

“I haven’t. I was planning to accompany you once we reach the station. What can you tell me about him?”

“He’s in bad shape. The damage from our engagement would’ve killed anyone else—even me. The corpsman found his left leg was nearly shattered, right wrist broken, significant head trauma, microfractures all over. And yet... he’s started to heal. His medical readings are... unusual.”

“Very interesting,” she said, her tone shifting to curiosity as she twirled her pen. “What about the ship or the cargo? Anything strange?”

“Where do I start? How much time do you have?” He slid the datapad over to her.

She held it in one hand, scrolling through its contents. Ammo, weapons, suits, food...

“What’s this? It says ‘Artifacts’?”

“Yes. That’s what we called them. We found them in reinforced crates. Even in his state, he tried to drag himself to them. We found him slumped against them, gun in hand. Whatever they are... they’re important.”

She continued taking notes without looking up, her left hand dancing across the page. As she finished the last line, she set her pen down and removed her glasses.

In a serious tone, she asked, “This all started with a medical shuttle being attacked. Were there any survivors?”

“No. I’m sorry—we couldn’t save the crew or the four wounded onboard.” Ashton watched her gentle features harden. Her eyes turned cold.

“Well, my dear Ashton,” she said darkly, “when you question this 'mysterious' man, don’t take it easy on him.”

Ashton nodded. To many, Amara was kind—an angel, even. But he knew few things were more important to her than the lives of her patients. Hearing of this tragedy had lit a fire behind her eyes.

**Attention all passengers. We are approaching our destination. Estimated time of arrival: 10 minutes.**





**Jade Industries Blacksite. Location: Classified.**

Ashton and Amara made their way toward the station's main elevator. The hallway was wide, lined with soft lighting along the top and bottom. The walls and ceiling were smooth white metal. Windows and potted plants broke the uniformity. Footsteps echoed gently, accompanied by faint typing and chatter from passing offices.

Ashton’s posture shifted back into his usual military bearing. As they rounded a corner, two familiar figures stood waiting.

Captain Gideon, now out of his flight suit, wore a similar outfit to the Chief. He had medium-length black hair parted in the middle. His pale green eyes, framed by dark brows, rarely revealed emotion. He stood silently, hands in his pockets.

Beside him stood Captain Leo. She was five inches taller, with long blonde hair streaked with brown at the roots, tied in a messy bun. Her deep blue eyes were sharp. A Jack of Spades tattoo peeked from beneath her shirt collar. She wore the same black camo pants as the others, with a form-fitting gray long sleeve that highlighted her lean, muscular build. Her hands rested on her hips.

They both wore Nexus 45 caliber sidearms on their—hips. They had a sleek and angular design with a two tone color scheme, a silver metallic slide and a matte black pistol grip. The trigger guard was enlarged for use with gloves. It was a symbol of station within the Jade defense force.



“Long time no see, Chief. Have a nice ride? Doctor Amara, how are you? I hope the Chief didn’t bore you with shop talk,” Leo said, offering a hand.



“Hello, Leo. It’s good to see you again. I trust you’re keeping these two out of trouble?” Amara gestured to Ashton and Gideon.

“I do my best, Doctor.”

“Settle down, Captain Leo. We have business to attend to,” Ashton said firmly.

“Fine, fine. You’re the boss.” She winked at Amara.

Gideon pressed the elevator button. The doors opened silently.

“The man’s already on the detention floor. No hostility, no words. His wounds are treated, and he’s been fed,” Gideon reported.

The elevator descended. A subtle shift of momentum signaled their arrival.

**“FLOOR ZERO-THREE. DETENTION LEVEL,”** the digital voice announced.

As the doors opened, a Marine called out, “ATTENTION ON DECK!” Staff snapped to attention.

“At ease. Where is the prisoner?”

“Right this way, Chief Lockwood,” said a Marine in grey armor with digital camo. A white top hat with a feather adorned his shoulder—the symbol of the Mad Hatters, a unit for dangerous individuals. His chest plate read STANFORD, with sergeant stripes and helmet marked M.H-1.



They followed him through double doors into a darker corridor. The white panels were gone, replaced by grey walls lit by amber lights. Yellow lines ran the length of the corridor, broken only by stenciled *“DETENTION”* signs.



They stopped at a reinforced door. Through the viewing window inside, a man sat on a medical bed, clad in a seafoam green gown. Four Marines stood watch inside.

“So this is the murderer,” Amara said flatly.

The two door guards snapped straighter.

“Good afternoon, Chief!” they barked.

“Good afternoon,” he replied. He scanned his ID badge.

**ACCESS GRANTED. CHIEF LOCKWOOD.**

Mechanical sounds echoed as the door unlocked.

“You four—stand by in the hall,” Lockwood ordered.

The Marines stepped out. Inside, Leo and Gideon took opposite sides of the room. The cell was cold. Cabinets and medical gear lined the walls. The viewing window was a one-way mirror.

“Have a name? Care to explain what you were doing in orbit of Luna? Why did you attack and murder innocent people?” Lockwood asked, eyes locked on the stranger.

A long pause.

“My name is Elias. I was scanning the planet for... something. I didn’t murder anyone who didn’t deserve it,” he said sarcastically.

“Is that supposed to be a joke?” Lockwood said coldly. “Is that what those metal objects you crawled to were?”

Elias looked away. In an instant, Lockwood grabbed his face and forced him to look up.

“YOU. WILL. Look at me when I’m talking to you.”

He let go and stepped back.

“Yes. They’re called artifacts by my people,” Elias said, voice shaking.

“Your people?” Lockwood asked.

“Yes. We are called Starborn.”

The faint scratching of Amara’s pen filled the silence.

“Where are your people? What planet are they from?”

Elias chuckled, but it died when he saw Amara’s glare.

“My people come from all over the galaxy. Only those who pass the trials become Starborn.”

“How curious,” Amara said, eyes narrow.

“Why did you attack the shuttle?” Lockwood asked. “Five medical staff dead. Four innocent patients. What was your justification? Murderer.”

“Murderer?” Elias echoed, confused. “I was—”

“Killing in cold blood makes you a murderer. **MURDERER.**”

“Be careful, Elias. They won’t be so gentle next time,” Lockwood warned. “One more time—why did you kill them?”

“Because they... they were humans. You are beneath me. I thought—”

“You thought you’d get away with it,” Amara snapped. “In your arrogance, you didn’t expect to be brought to your knees.”

“I... I did…” Elias whispered.

“How pathetic,” she spat.

“Think about what you’ve done. We’ll be back to chat more. If you try anything, the Marines will ensure you never walk again,” Lockwood said.

Leo knocked three times on the door. The lock disengaged.

“You aren't special. YOU are beneath me. Secure the room. Make sure Mister Elias is comfortable,” Lockwood ordered.

“YES, CHIEF!” the Marines responded.

As they exited, Amara paused, casting one last cold glance at Elias as the door slowly shut.





The door locked, and the group walked down the hallway. The only sounds were their footsteps and the rustle of fabric as their legs moved. Stanford led them to the floor’s lobby and gestured to a meeting room.

“Don’t worry, Chief. We’ll make sure he’s ‘comfortable,’” Stanford joked.

The group passed through the metal door into the meeting room. The floor was carpeted gray, and the white walls were adorned with various landscape photos. On the far side, a large window looked out over a lush planet—one that didn’t look too different from the Earth of old. In the center stood a large wooden table with metal legs, surrounded by six leather chairs. You could cut the tension with a knife as they each took a seat. Lockwood sat at the head of the table by the window, Amara beside him on the left. Gideon and Leo took the seats closest to the door.

Leo broke the silence. “Well, Chief, I have to say—your questioning is as scary as ever,” she said, smirking at the older man.

“You were pushing pretty hard. Elias didn’t seem to appreciate being talked down to,” Gideon said in his usual monotone.

“What did you make of that, Amara?” Lockwood asked curiously.

“To put it plainly? I think he’s full of shit. ‘Starborn’? ‘Those who pass the trials’? Sounds a little too far-fetched,” Amara replied with a dismissive tone.

“If it weren’t for the ship and the armor he was wearing, I’d agree. But what if there’s some truth to his words? He had mysterious ‘Artifacts’ that give readings we can't even explain. This is becoming more troublesome than I expected.” Lockwood leaned back and turned to face the window, resting his hand on his chin, index finger tapping his lips.

Leo and Gideon exchanged a glance.

“We’ll give it an hour, then go again. Gideon, you’ll take point this time.”

“Yes, Chief.”

Lockwood turned back to his captains. “What’s happened here is not to be discussed until we understand the full picture. Understood?”

“Yes, Chief,” Leo and Gideon replied in unison.

“Of course,” Amara added.

“Gideon, do you have any info on the ship, armor, or weapons?” the Chief asked, leaning forward with his elbows on the table.

“Negative, Chief. We can’t ascertain the origin of any of it. It’s completely alien. Jade Industries is one of the most advanced companies in the settled systems, but this stuff is leagues ahead of anything we have. I recommend Major Lila to oversee the investigation once the Gabriel reaches the Denali airfield.” 

“Thank you, Gideon. I’ll contact her after this meeting, maybe she’ll get us some answers.”

“Amara... any thoughts? Input?”

“No, Ashton. All that matters to me is that he gets what he deserves. Calling us ‘humans’ like it was some kind of insult,” she said, clearly annoyed.

Lockwood sighed. “In due time, let's stay focused.”

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. It was Sergeant Stanford.

“Excuse my interruption, Chief. There’s a situation with Elias,” he said urgently.

The four immediately followed Stanford down the hall. Ahead, two Marines stood at the door with rifles at the ready.

As they looked into the room, it was chaos. Elias was being held down by four Marines, while the other two helped a nurse up from the floor.

“WHAT HAPPENED, SERGEANT?” Lockwood barked.

“The nurse was changing his fluids and needed to take a blood sample. Elias struck her, shouting ‘Get away from me, filth!’”

“OPEN THIS DOOR. Amara, stay out here,” Lockwood ordered.

The door swung open, and Lockwood stormed in with his two captains.

“STAND ASIDE,” he barked.

The four Marines released Elias and raised their rifles. Gideon and Leo drew their Nexus pistols. All six weapons were trained on Elias.

The moment Elias saw the Chief charging toward him, he froze. Fear flooded him as Lockwood grabbed him, flinging him off the bed and ripping out tubes and wires.

The crash of medical equipment and scuffling boots filled the room as Elias slammed into the wall.

“EXPLAIN YOURSELF!” Lockwood demanded, advancing.

Time slowed for Elias. His wide eyes stared at the dark, imposing silhouette.

*It's him… That fucking monster…*

As Lockwood drew closer, his face came into view.

Subtle tan skin. Hazel eyes—cold and uncaring. Sharp features. Brown hair streaked with gray…

Elias had seen this man before. That gaze burned into his memory.

*I remember... It was my second time through Unity. I was being hunted. My fellow Starborn were slaughtered by mere mortals. How did he find me again? Is he... Starborn too?*

His thoughts were broken by Lockwood’s grip on his gown.

*I’m... I’m too weak…*

Elias thought. Desperate, he tried to release a shockwave.

“Too slow,” Lockwood muttered, redirecting Elias’s arm and slamming him to the floor.

The last thing Elias saw was that terrifying, familiar face glaring down before everything went dark.

*I remember…*





**Stardate: Unknown. Location: Unknown.**

“MISSION: kill or capture enemy Starborn. They are responsible for the total loss of the hospital outpost. Show no mercy. Seek and destroy,” the onboard AI said.

The roar of engines grew louder as the dropship entered the atmosphere.

“One minute till landing. The enemy airfield has been destroyed. Unknown number of survivors remain around the facility,” the AI said.

Three Headhunters stood in the bay as the ship completed its landing sequence.

The hum of the ship was replaced by strong winds and distant alarms.

As the bay doors opened, a terrifying sight emerged—three Jade Empire Headhunters stood, backlit by crimson light.

To the left was a tall, slender figure wielding two Nexus 45 pistols. Staff Sergeant Leo bounced in place, eager to engage.

To the right stood another figure, slightly shorter, cradling a Mag Sniper Rifle. Gunnery Sergeant Gideon double-checked his gear and primed his jetpack.

At the center stood Chief Lockwood, holding a heavily modified Kodama submachine gun—armor-piercing, smart-targeting. A brutal weapon for a brutal man.

All three wore black armor, enhanced exoskeletons amplifying their already unnatural abilities. Dimly lit white spades marked their shoulders. Their helmets featured quad night vision goggles—four green-lit tubes.

Their very presence meant death.

Lockwood gave the order quietly. “Seek and destroy.”

In the blink of an eye, they launched toward the hospital.

The Starborn—ancient beings of vast power, reborn across lifetimes—were a terror to most. To the Headhunters, they were vermin.

Leo danced across the courtyard with deadly grace. She was the fastest in the Empire, a blur of motion and violence. Her twin pistols sang death.

On the ridge above, Gideon operated like a machine. Aim. Fire. Adjust. No wasted movement. His feed shared tactical data with his team.

Close behind Leo, Lockwood carved through the enemy with ruthless precision, his Kodama cutting down targets before they even raised a weapon.

Only five minutes had passed.

**Same time inside the hospital.**

Elias stood in an elevator with two other Starborn. One was his mentor—Ashley, commander of the Starborn in this galaxy. She had trained him, survived countless lifetimes.

As the elevator opened, a nightmare awaited. The hospital lobby was pitch-black. Orbital strikes had killed the power. The ceiling stretched three stories high, walkways lining the walls. Shattered windows rained glass onto the floor.

Distant gunfire echoed. And then… laughter.

Something giggled in the dark. Giddy. Demonic. Wrong.

The trio froze.

“Something’s wrong,” Elias whispered, trembling.

“Stand fast!” Ashley commanded.

Footsteps echoed around them—nearby and far off at once.

A flash of blue illuminated the corridor.

Elias looked up. One of the Starborn with them stood still, weapon dangling.

Then Elias saw it—their head, severed.

The body dropped to its knees, then disintegrated into stardust.

Elias couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

“ELIAS! RUN!” Ashley screamed.

A blur slammed her into the wall. It cracked on impact.

Elias stared at her broken body—helmet shattered, blood and tears on her face, fear in her eyes.

He looked up.

Leo giggled.

“Look at this one, Chief,” she mocked.

From the shadows, Lockwood appeared, crouched and watching. His glowing goggles made him look inhuman.

He ripped Elias’s helmet off and tossed it aside. Examined him. Then removed his own helmet—cold, calculating eyes stared into Elias’s soul.

“How pathetic. You Starborn think you’re special. But you’re as weak and fragile as any human.”

His words cut deep.

“Tell your friends—if they’re still alive—never come into our universe again.”

“I…” Elias began.

Leo’s kick ended his sentence.

1kyn5eb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyn5eb,Is there a mature way to slowly disconnect from my old life?,"Back again. After my last post, I decided to finally visit a church, thanks to God and my cousin for driving me there—and I really enjoyed the Ascension service. The priest gave me blessed bread, and he also gave me some icons, and I told him that I was interested in being a catechumen and he said that he'd email me later today with a PDF of a book about catechism, if I remember correctly

I've only met the people from my church today but they are overwhelmingly nice to have been around. I befriended this old couple, and now they're even offering to drive me there when my cousin isn't able to drive me to church. Now how cool is that? I'll have the opportunity to start going consistently!

The thing is, my grandparents are Jehovah's Witnesses so—I'd definitely get some pushback if I directly told them what's happening, as I have told them I've been interested in Orthodoxy almost a year ago; and the response wasn't exactly enthusiastic, to say the least.

The only real benefit on that side is that they no longer force me or my sister to attend JW church anymore. I also think it should be important to note that I could care less about 'proving' Orthodoxy to them. It is their choice and not mine—I can't teach people who have not agreed to be my students; I want to avoid self-righteousness. They have their way and I have mine. My goal isn't to turn ultra-Orthodox and spit on everyone who isn't Orthodox. I find beauty in the way my grandparents respect their own religion.

One part of me wants to give my grandparents the benefit of the doubt and tell them about everything, but the other part of me also knows exactly what is going to happen if I tell them or ask them permission for this. How I see it—I've come so far now (for context, I've been inquiring since 2023, since I was around 14) that, to be honest, I don't really care about their opinion on what church I go to anymore. And I'm sorry for that.

Not only this, but I realize how much I prefer the company of the people at my church over the company of my friends—the other boys around my age. And I just met the people at my church less than 12 hours ago. They made a big impression on me, to say the least.

The whole experience at the Ascension service and the coffee hour afterwards made me realize how much time I waste doing the things I do. I waste so much time talking to the other boys my age and seeking their approval. I waste so much time pretending to be someone that I'm not. But it felt like none of that mattered anymore when I was in church.

At first, I was a bit anxious as I first entered. I felt like I wasn't worthy of even being there, and I remember just feeling this 'weight' of my sins and I felt like I didn't even deserve to be there at all; that I'd commited so much sin, should just leave and stop nos, and also how other people would kill to even attend church at all but someone like me was able to go first.

But that was the point. God is merciful.

By the end of the service, I felt a lot better and at peace, even. Even as I write this, my intrusive thoughts that used to rule me have become nothing to me now—and when they came back, they certainly don't have the same effect they used to have. My mind is silent but in a good way, if that makes sense. I still do struggle a bit with thinking that some strange sensation after prayer (which in reality, is just my empty, hungry stomach) is a 'sign,' but I'm learning to not trust things like this anymore and that life doesn't work like the Hollywood movies.

By the time my cousin drove me back to his house to spend the night, I realized that I don't really want this old life anymore. It's unfulfilling. It's depressing. I want this new life that I wasn't even worthy of being able to have the slightest taste of.

I feel fulfilled for once in my life. Yet I feel guilty that I want to actively start shedding the old life off as soon as I tasted how my new life could bd. Is there any way to do this? I've contemplated just ghosting all of my old friends, as I've reconciled everything with them and asked for their forgiveness which they gave me. I don't really talk to any of them and it all just feels like a reminder of my old life. They've forgiven me and I've forgiven them.

I'm sorry if any of this comes off self-centered or arrogant. Thank you if you give me any advice.

Writing on behalf of friend and someone I used to supervise - who I'll call G - bc I don't know how to advise them to prepare for an upcoming first appeals hearing with TWC. 

Here's the situation: We both worked for many years for a non-profit that has always maintained the policy \*not\* to contest unemployment claims from former staff members, even in the case of a separation for cause, severance, etc. 

G contacted me about a month ago and said they'd been fired for a mistake they made at work that's not typically grounds for separation on its own at the org but was definitely a significant mistake. (They had a good reputation while I was there, but obvs I can't speak to the fairness of the decision bc I wasn't around for it.)

They called yesterday, panicked, because TWC denied their unemployment claim, stating they were terminated for misconduct. They assumed - and so did I (bc I guess I know less than I thought about TWC) - that our former employer was responsible for the denial. We brainstormed how to prep for the appeal, and that seemed to be that. 

I was shocked, though, by the denial, given what I know about the organization, so when I had coffee with one of their former bosses that night, I did some super stealth (not really) reconnaissance. She told me that \*TWC,\* not the org, denied the claim bc G provided ""too much"" information about the circumstances surrounding the separation in their application for unemployment benefits. Whatever the ""too much"" was led TWC to determine that G was fired for misconduct. 

When I asked how the org was planning to handle it, I wasn't able to get really definitive information beyond that 1.) the Chief People Officer is planning to attend the hearing, and 2.) the CPO, former boss, and others were upset about TWC's decision. My impression, though, was that the org didn't feel like there was much to be done on G's behalf. 

Has anyone had experience with a situation like this, where the employer's ok with paying unemployment but TWC isn't? If so, any suggestions on what, if anything, G (or I, maybe) can do at this point to secure those benefits? Any thoughts, comments, sympathy for G, and so on would be much appreciated.

1kyn2en,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanOpinion/comments/1kyn2en/brian_niccol_starbucks_ceo_analysis/,Brian Niccol – Starbucks CEO Analysis,"As part of its leadership overhaul, Starbucks hired a new CFO. Cathy Smith was awarded a $5 million sign-on bonus on top of a base pay of $925,000 per year and $4.5 million in stock incentives. Yet this is nothing compared to the compensation package of their new CEO, Brian Niccol, who was poached from Chipotle by Starbucks to transform the brand and bring success back to the business. The company aims to increase earnings, yet they awarded Niccol a **$96 million dollar compensation package**, making him the highest paid CEO in the company’s history. As one of the highest paid executives in corporate America, [Niccol earned approximately 6,666 times that of its average barista](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It is worth pointing out, in regard to that number, that many Starbucks employees work part time. This compensation pack put him above the CEO of Apple, Microsoft, Disney, GE, and more when comparing 2024 CEO annual pay. Apple and Microsoft generated net incomes that were almost *triple* that of Starbucks in 2024, which makes this all the more shocking in my opinion.

**Brian Niccol Starbucks Compensation Package Breakdown:**

* $10 million signing bonus
* $5 million sign on bonus after one month of employment
* $1.6 million annual base salary
* [$418,071 additional compensation benefit ](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf)(cost breakdown page 72)
* $250,000 allocated explicitly for *personal travel* using a private corporate jet
* $90 million in stock awards

Meanwhile, the company continues to permanently shut down locations and layoff employees. Niccol recently [announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that the company would eliminate 1,100 corporate employees (not baristas) to

>“increase operational efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity, and drive better integration”. Niccol explained that the layoffs, which took effect 2/25, were necessary to address these issues.

Now, after these layoffs, the **CEO tells workers to step it up** and that he

>“[wants corporate employees to work harder](https://qz.com/starbucks-corporate-workers-big-fix-menu-cuts-1851767920?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=quartz_reddit) and take accountability for the coffee giant’s financial health” claiming that the chain's turnaround now relies on greater accountability; “[we own whether or not this place grows](https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/starbucks-ceo-tells-workers-to-step-it-up-after-layoffs-3fdba9f3)”. 

This greater accountability doesn’t seem to apply to Niccol. He also[ announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that hiring for future partners in the U.S. will require relocation to Seattle to work in the head office. Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle headquarters for his commute so he can work in person 3 days a week. The greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): “At Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet. Across our company, we are testing and scaling innovative solutions to support partners, farmers and communities in the face of global climate change.”

>[“Starbucks touts ](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/starbucks-new-ceo-has-a-big-footprint-commutes-private-jet-nevermind-climate-goals-3df1aa5f)its “decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change”, and claims achieving this goal “takes all of us”, it nonetheless has allowed the new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to commute weekly from his California home via private jet”. [“Estimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), “indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That’s roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.”

Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote against](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. Considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company, let alone the environment. 

>Defending the cost of hiring Niccol, the Starbucks board stated that they believe “Mr. Niccol, a highly sought-after, effective leader with a proven track record, has the ideal industry experience and operational background to drive sustainable, long-term growth at Starbucks”. “[Starbucks' critical need](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) for a transformative leader at a pivotal moment in its history” led them to poach Niccol from Chipotle, where he was also the CEO.

Clearly the company believes their investment will pay off. Initially, it did. After announcing Niccol as CEO the companies stock price shot up 24%[ (pg 43)](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It has since then fallen.

The fact that **Niccol is a known union buster** surely helped secure his employment, not that the company would ever admit it. It’s no surprise that union negotiations with the company have stalled since December.

>Currently, ""[union members](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-01/starbucks-union-baristas-contract-talks) remain critical of how bargaining has been conducted under Niccol's tenure and have questioned his compensation package.""

The previous CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, pivoted away from the tough stance of founder Howard Shultz regarding unions, and agreed (in Feb 2024) to [begin contract discussions](https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/amid-rising-unionizing-efforts-starbucks-accepts-mediation-with-unionized-workers/91142408). 6 months later, Niccol was announced as the new CEO. While the company listed other reasons for the decision, one can only wonder...

Brian Niccol is no stranger to success. He is credited with many achievements in his previous positions at Pizza Hut (CMO), Taco Bell (CMO & CEO), and, most notably, Chipotle (CEO). Much of his success in these positions was achieved through digital innovation. 

* Pizza Hut (CMO 2007-2011)
   * Introduced mobile phone ordering in 2008, followed by an app in 2009 which, after 3 months, generated $1 million in sales.
* Taco Bell (CMO 2011-2015)(CEO 2015-2018)
   * Oversaw implementation of breakfast menu, Cantina Bell menu, the launch of Doritos Locos Taco, and the “Live Mas” slogan
   * Increased revenue, market share, and profitability
* Chipotle (CEO 2018-2024)
   * Implemented chipotlanes
   * Added digital order pick-up shelves
   * Doubled revenue, increased profits x7
   * Increased stock price x8 

**Will this success translate to his new job as CEO of Starbucks?** ***I would argue NO.*** 

Starbucks gave Niccol an outrageous compensation package, and it's questionable that their investment will pay off. His heavy focus on digital presence seems unlikely to yield the same level of success it did in his other jobs. Online ordering is a common tool utilized by most companies now, like Starbucks, unlike when Niccol pushed it forward at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. While he is credited with creating secondary make lines for online orders at Chipotle, one [article](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol-listens-while-he-works/#:~:text=Following%20the%20savvy%20action%20of,it%20made%20customers%20happier%2C%20too.) credits the origin of the idea to a Chipotle store operator, not Niccol. There is no doubt Niccol has extensive digital experience, but Starbucks already has both mobile ordering and drive throughs available for customers to use. The long mobile order wait times are the one area Starbucks really needs to improve. While I have no doubt Niccol will have an impact here, I doubt he will be able to attain the same degree of success he did with Taco Bell or Chipotle, something shareholders and investors clearly expect to see from him again.

He joined both Taco Bell and Chipotle during times when they were struggling due to issues with food quality. Taco Bell was dealing with the fallout of a lawsuit over beef quality that lead to a [28%](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/us/taco-bell-still-hurting-from-beef-quality-lawsuit-idUSN1E76D0LV/) decrease in operating profit Q2 2011. Chipotle had the infamous e.coli outbreak in 2015 that severely damaged the brand. Niccol is credited with leading a successful turnaround effort at both, but the companies really had no other place to go but up after these things were fixed, something any CEO was capable of achieving.

""But look at how much he increased revenue, profit, and stock price at Chipotle!"" One might argue this, but let me tell you how he really achieved this. Price increases, prices increase, and then more price increases. The company hadn’t increased prices too much in the years before Niccol became CEO. After he joined in 2018 prices increased about 10% across the year. Since 2021 the company has [increased prices 7 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/1h60h2q/chipotle_to_raise_prices_for_the_7th_time_since/) under his leadership. While some increase is necessary and expected, his increases far exceeded both. Since he left, prices increased once by 2% in December, and the new CEO (Scott Boatwright) announced the company will absorb any cost increases incurred by Trump's tariffs. Something I highly doubt Niccol would have done. ""But Starbucks pledged to not increase prices in 2025!"" Yeah, except they made this promise before the announcement of the tariffs. Also, have they actually kept this promise so far? [This Reddit user claims not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1j6ofvn/whats_up_with_starbucks_raising_prices_after/) To be fair, Niccol did recognize that many people have expressed displeasure with Starbucks prices and how they’ve been increasing, which he ignored at Chipotle. Something I’m sure he regrets now considering the tariffs. 

Overall, based on the information I’ve gathered it seems like much of his previous success was primarily due to lucky timing. I don’t see him being successful at Starbucks. Thus far, stock prices would indicate I’m not wrong. The changes he has made so far haven’t done anything to improve the company. The practice, which was halted in 2020 during the pandemic, generated some buzz initially, but quickly fell apart as most baristas didn’t meet expectations. Considering a major issue Starbucks faces is long wait times, the implemented idea by Niccol seems counterintuitive. Baristas don't have time for it but some have claimed they've been [written up](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1iz8tyc/written_up_for_forgetting_to_write_on_cups/&ved=2ahUKEwjH_5eJ7seNAxW2tokEHTatCbYQFnoECCQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1UsYFiNHs2RU1HaxBDdyQi) or [sent home](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j5cutx/sent_home_for_not_writing_on_cups/%23:~:text%3DSent%2520home%2520for%2520not%2520writing%2520on%2520cups%2520:%2520r/starbucks&ved=2ahUKEwiZjKHO7seNAxUGlokEHTM_H60Q-tANegQIDRAP&usg=AOvVaw2Oa8R0qIxiAGWjQS025n7s) by their manager for failing to do so. Overall, the idea seems to have backfired.

Niccol also decided to change the dress code, requiring baristas to wear solid black shirts, a change not well received by employees.

>""Customers care more about the wait time for their latte than the shirt their barista is [wearing](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code).""

Changing the dress code seems entirely unnecessary and useless. I fail to see how the color of a baristas shirt is going to impact guest perception. Personally, I've never even noticed the color of their shirts before. The decision seems to be one meant to impress shareholders by showing Starbucks is 'professional' and 'high end'. Additionally, it's surely meant to reinforce company culture (something Niccol is supposed to excel at improving) but the change has done the opposite of improving employee satisfaction, negatively impacting moral for many. Niccol, a known union buster, didn't involve the union in this decision either.

>""[Union workers say](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code) the change is both restrictive and unproductive—and now, baristas are walking out."" ""In an email to supporters, Starbucks Workers United—the union representing Starbucks baristas—called the dress code “restrictive,” adding that it was implemented “without input from the baristas it affects.” The union has been bargaining to reach a contract with Starbucks for over three years, with no end in sight. It says that the new dress code represents “bad faith bargaining,” alleging that the code undermines a tentative agreement about attire made at the bargaining table."" ""Starbucks should be working to finish the contract and solve its staffing issue—not implementing a new dress code. “We’re more than mad because the changes that the company is making don’t address the issues that we’re facing in the stores.""

Let's be real it's a coffee shop, not fine dining. Black shirt, blue shirt, purple shirt...no one cares. Except the CEO apparently. He wants to create a consistent and recognizable brand experience for guests as if the green apron didn't already accomplish that. Both the dress code change and cup writing seem to be out of touch decisions. Maybe Niccol needs to spend some time working as a barista to figure out how he could actually improve things for both guests and employees.

Brian Niccol gets too much hype in the corporate world in my opinion. I’m just waiting for his downfall–honestly I’m hoping for it.

Chapter one

It was a beautiful day in downtown L.A.—the sun sparkling like a diamond ring on a bride’s finger.
Tom Hart, private investigator, lucked into a prime parking spot right in front of his building. Had the makings of a great day.

That’s when a kid—maybe eighteen—walked up and asked for a light.

Tom struck a match with his thumb in one smooth motion, the flame flaring against the breeze. The kid leaned in, lit his cigarette with a nervous twitch, then pulled a switchblade.

“Give me your wallet, old timer, and I won’t hurt you.”

Before the kid knew what hit him, Tom cracked him across the nose with his .38 revolver. The punk landed hard on the sidewalk, staring up at the sky.

Tom planted his heel on the kid’s chest and pressed down.

“You’re lucky I’m in a good mood, punk,” he said. “Get lost. If I see you around here again, it’ll be a bullet up your nose.”

The kid scrambled away, bleeding and limping. Tom tucked the .38 back into his shoulder holster.

That’s when he noticed it—the cherry red Alfa Romeo Spider parked in front of his office. Hard to miss. Impossible to forget.

He climbed the two flights to his office. Beth was already behind her desk, typing. When Tom walked in, she gave a subtle nod toward the leather couch in the waiting area.

“Hello, Tom.”

“Oh, Christene,” he muttered. “Should’ve known when I saw that red Spider downstairs.”

“Step inside,” he said, and he ushered her into his office.

Tom sank behind his desk. Beth brought him a cup of strong, black coffee—no words exchanged.

“So,” he said, “how’s Andy?”

“That’s why I’m here. He’s missing. It’s been three days—I haven’t heard a word.”

Christene was the cousin of Tom’s ex-wife, Ann. She and Andy had a rocky marriage—affairs on both sides—but disappearing wasn’t Andy’s style.

“How’ve you two been getting along lately?”

“Same old,” she said. “We live our own lives. See people on the side. But we always come home. That’s never been a secret.”

“Andy still into the bookies?”

“Yeah, unfortunately. Victor Malone. Andy owes him five grand. He’s having trouble coming up with it. That’s why I’m hesitant to go to the police.”

“Anyone else who might want to hurt him?”

“He’s got a girl—Angel. He told her up front about our open marriage. She was fine at first, but lately she’s been getting crazy. Telling him to divorce me so they can be together.”

Christene Mary was tall, big-boned, with dirty blonde hair and big blue eyes. Heavier than Tom remembered—but it had been ten years.

“Give me everything you’ve got on Malone and Angel,” Tom said. “I’ll start there. And it’ll be $200 up front.”

She reached into her purse and laid two crisp hundred-dollar bills on his desk.

“Always business,” she said, and left the room.

Chapter 2

Tom pulled up in front of Finest, the butcher shop on Ventura Boulevard that doubled as a front for Victor Malone’s gambling and loan-sharking operations.

It was another scorcher in L.A.—the kind of day where the heat bounced off plate glass like neon off the Vegas Strip.

Malone was a butcher by trade. Knew how to break down a side of beef—and a body, if someone stiffed him. The skill had come in handy more than once. Still, he took pride in the legit side of the business, providing quality cuts to his neighborhood regulars.

The shop looked more like a mini-market than a corner butcher. Tom stepped inside, caught the chill of the refrigerated air, and asked for Malone. A stock boy nodded toward the stairs.

“Upstairs. Office.”

Tom climbed the narrow flight and knocked.

“What is it?” barked Malone from inside.

“Tom Hart. Private investigator. I’m looking into Andy Mary. One of your customers. His wife hasn’t heard from him in three days. That’s not like him. Thought maybe you’d know something.”

Malone leaned back in his chair. “You just told me something I didn’t know. Sounds like Andy’s skipping out on his tab. Five large. Guess I’ll start looking for him.”

“Maybe you already found him,” Tom said. “Turned him into ground chuck.”

Malone chuckled. “Not a bad suggestion. You ever want work, Hart, you’ve got a gift for thinking like me. Seems like you’re giving more info than you’re getting.”

“Yeah, I can see this is going nowhere.”

“Tell Benny to make you a hero sandwich on the house. Italian, oil and vinegar. I appreciate the heads-up—means Andy’s ducking me.”

Tom took the sandwich. It was damn good.

He wasn’t sure if Malone had genuinely been surprised—or just good at playing dumb. Either way, Andy might’ve skipped town, or he might be hanging from a meat hook in the back.

He’d head back to the office and eat before meeting with Angel.

Chapter 3

Tom went back to the office and broke out the sandwich. He gave half to Beth, who smiled, impressed.

He sat behind his desk and took a bite. Something didn’t add up. Andy was struggling to pay a five-thousand-dollar gambling debt, meanwhile Christene was driving around in an Alfa Romeo. She clearly had a high-end boyfriend on the side, just like Andy had this Angel girl. He filed it away for later and headed to Ventura Beach, where Christene said Angel could be found tanning every day.

She was a pole dancer at the Cougar Club, which specialized in women over thirty. A tryst with a customer in a VIP room could earn a girl a good living. According to Christene, that’s where she met Andy.

Andy was around forty-five. A carpenter by trade, he was always a good provider. He supplemented his income doing collections for Malone and Enrique Costa—a loan shark with a Mexican crew. Could be he was skimming off Costa to pay Malone and got himself offed. But who knows. Just speculation. Christene had offered plenty of intel.

Tom took off his shoes and socks and rolled up his pants.

The sun was stifling. He loosened his tie and rolled up his sleeves.

Angel was on the beach, right where Christene said she’d be.

“Angel. My name’s Tom Hart. Your boyfriend Andy’s wife hired me to find him. She hasn’t heard from him in three days. Wondering if you have.”

“Andy’s a loser. I’m done with him. He chose her over me, so to hell with him.”

“According to her, you’ve been acting crazy lately. Calling the house, showing up at all hours. What’s with the sudden change?”

“I run into a lot of men at work. They come and go. Andy was a terrific guy—handsome, tough. A real man’s man. I fell for him, yeah. But I ain’t into hopeless causes.”

“So you don’t know anything that can help me find him?”

“Well, did she tell you she’s been sleeping with Costa? Heard it’s really hot and heavy. He bought her that convertible she’s driving around in. Maybe they had a motive to get rid of Andy. Ask her.”

Tom thanked her for her time. She was a hot little number in her bikini.

“Stop by and see me at the club. Bring your checkbook—I’m worth it.”

“I’m sure you are, sweetheart.”

Tom put his socks and shoes back on at the boardwalk after shaking the sand off his feet.

Christene never mentioned her affair with Costa, which made her and Costa suspects. Time to follow up with Christene.

Chapter 4

Enrique Costa worked out of his nightclub on South Hill Street, right in the heart of the Latin Strip. High-end joint. Catered to classy patrons with plenty of cash to burn.
The club’s slogan was “Every night is New Year’s Eve”—and Costa was its charismatic king.
The crown jewel was a massive chandelier hanging over the dance floor, sparkling like a promise.

Tom walked in around 11 p.m. The place was packed. Music pulsed. The bar was three deep with revelers, and the floor was alive with swing dancers and champagne flutes. He spotted Christene exactly where he expected—seated at Costa’s private table, holding court with a few banker types.

Their eyes met. She waved, all lipstick and sparkle.
“Tom, come join us!” she called out.

Tom didn’t smile. “We need to talk, Christene.”
He leaned close enough to be heard. “Why didn’t you tell me about your relationship with Costa? Didn’t you think it would put you in a compromising situation?”

“Oh, Tom, please,” she said with a breathy laugh. “You know Andy and I always had our side affairs. That was never a secret.”

“Maybe not to you. But don’t you see how this looks? It could look like you and Costa knocked off Andy so you two could be together.”

“Why would we kill him, silly? We could’ve just gotten a divorce if that’s what we wanted. When I asked you to find Andy, I meant it.”

“Uh-huh. Well, according to Angel, Enrique bought you that car. Is he supporting you financially? Andy couldn’t cover a five-thousand-dollar gambling debt, and you’re driving a brand-new sports car. How does that look?” Tom said.

“Exactly like what it is,” Christene said. “Maybe Enrique and I will be together—but for now, I want you to find Andy. I still care about him.”

Tom clenched his jaw. She was drunk, and making less sense the longer they talked. That’s when Enrique Costa showed up.

Barrel-chested. Hair slicked back. Latin lover type right out of central casting. He leaned in and kissed Christene like a man kissing his wife.

“So,” he said with a grin, “is this the private eye you hired to find Andy?”

“Enrique, Tom—Tom, Enrique,” she said, lazily gesturing between them.

They shook hands. Costa had a firm grip and a polished smile.

“I’m paying him, you know,” he added.

Tom didn’t blink. “You understand how this looks, right? Andy worked for you. Made collections. Now he owes money to Malone—money he doesn’t have. Meanwhile, you’re dating his wife. I wish you’d been up front about all this, Christene.”

“Come on, let’s all have a glass of champagne,” Enrique said, motioning to a passing waiter. “If I killed Andy, would I really be paying you to find him? Christene cares about the guy—doesn’t want him hurt. After you find him, she’ll divorce him, and then she and I can be together. That’s the truth.”

It was crazy. But maybe crazy enough to be true.
Tom had always liked Andy and Christene. They were the only two from his ex-wife’s family who were ever decent to him.

They clinked glasses. Drank champagne.
And Tom resolved to get to the bottom of this twisted little web.

Chapter 5

Victor Malone was alone in his office, tallying receipts from the day’s drop—the cut from what the Butcher store brought in.

He picked up the phone, about to order one of his guys to find Andy Mary and bring him in.
But before he could dial, the door burst open.
An assassin in a black hoodie stormed in and shot him three times in the chest.
Malone was dead before he hit the floor.

Tom got the call from Steve Foley, an old friend from his LAPD days. Steve was homicide now.

“Victor Malone was murdered last night in his office,” Foley said. “Your card was on his desk. You working on something connected?”

Tom gave him the rundown. Foley listened, then said, “There’s nothing tying Costa to the murder—not yet.”

But Tom knew better. The missing piece was still Andy. If he could find him, maybe he could make sense of this mess.

He put a tail on Angel. Something about her wasn’t sitting right. She’d gone from jealous wreck to calm and rational too quickly. Like someone had coached her. Or paid her off.

Around 10 p.m., she left for her job at the Cougar Club.

Tom made his move.

He climbed the stairs to the fourth floor of her apartment building. Picked the lock with a paper clip—quiet, quick. Once inside, he heard movement in the bedroom.

He drew his .38 and moved in slow.

“Don’t move,” he barked.

The figure froze.
Tom flipped the light.

It was Andy.

“Well, well,” Tom said. “I figured I might find you here. Angel wasn’t too convincing yesterday at the beach.”

Andy squinted, rubbing his eyes. “Tom? What are you doing here?”

“Christene put me on the case. Said she hadn’t heard from you in three days and was getting worried.”

“Yeah? Who’s paying you—Costa?”

“Christene. Where she’s getting the money isn’t my concern.”

Andy sat up on the edge of the bed, shirtless and wired. “I’m hiding out from Malone. I owe him five grand, Tom. I don’t have it. Angel and I were planning to skip to Mexico before he found me and tossed me into a meat grinder.”

“Well, you can cancel that trip,” Tom said. “Malone’s dead. Shot in his office last night.”

Andy blinked. “Malone’s dead?”

“Yeah, Malone’s dead. And I’m having a hard time believing you didn’t have something to do with it.”

Tom turned for the door.

“Look,” he said without turning back, “you haven’t done anything illegal—yet. But you’re smack in the middle of something, and I don’t know what it is. Whatever it is, it’s going to blow up in your face.”

He pulled the door shut behind him, thinking:
If I was able to find Andy here, I’ll bet Costa can too.

Chapter 6

Tom got in his car and drove away. He noticed a black Chevy sedan parked on the corner. It took him about two blocks to realize the same car had followed him from his office to Angel’s place.

Whoever it was had used him to find Andy.

He made a U-turn and sped back to Angel’s building. The black sedan was gone. Tom ran up the stairs two at a time and burst into Angel’s apartment—but it was too late.

Andy was dead. A single bullet between the eyes.

Tom stood frozen, sick with guilt. Costa had played him like a piano—used him to lead the way, then cleaned up the mess. Now Costa was free to marry Christene, the girl in the cherry-red convertible. They’d even toasted to it—an inside joke between the two of them, and Tom had been too blind to catch it.

It didn’t take long for Detective Steve Foley to arrive.

“This is Andy, Steve,” Tom said, numb. “They used me to find him. It’s Costa.”

“You’ve got a theory,” Foley replied. “But do you have anything concrete that can incriminate Costa in court?”

“Nothing. It was a perfect plan. They set me up the moment she stepped into my office.”

“Look,” Steve said. “I’ll work that angle—and anything else you can give me. But we need more than that to make an arrest. There’s nothing more you can do here. Go home, Tom. Sleep on it. You might see things clearer in the morning.”

But Tom couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t let it go. Not like this.

He had to settle it with Christene.

He realized now he couldn’t believe a word she said. Just like her cousin Ann—his ex-wife. Same charm, same lies, same lipstick.

He pulled up to the house—Andy’s house—and rang the doorbell.

“Tom,” Christene said, surprised. She was still in her robe, calm and pretty like nothing had happened. “What brings you here at this hour?”

Tom’s face was gray, like ash. He was furious, but he kept it bottled up.

“The case is closed, Christene. I found Andy tonight. Unfortunately, somebody else found him too—after me—and killed him.”

Christene dropped to one knee, crying hysterically.

“Well,” Tom said coldly, “there’s nothing stopping you from marrying Costa now.”

She looked up, eyes blazing. “How dare you say that. I loved Andy. That’s why I hired you, damn it!”

“Then make it make sense, Christene. I want to believe you. But it’s not easy.”

“I can’t,” she said. “Andy had Angel, and I had Enrique. We moved on—but we still loved each other. I know it’s sick, but that’s the truth.”

Tom nodded slowly. “Andy also had demons he was wrestling with. Anyway, my job’s done. Homicide’s got it now.”

“No,” she said, grabbing his hand. “Your job’s not done. Find his murderer. Help them do it—you’re the best. If it’s Enrique, prove it.”

Chapter 7

Tom went back to his apartment. He lay down on the couch and turned on the television. An old John Wayne movie was playing—Stagecoach. He wasn’t really paying attention, but he left it on. The noise soothed his brain.

There was something puzzling about Christene’s reaction. It was honest—maybe too honest. Too passionate for an ex grieving her dead husband.

Tom started working on a theory. Maybe it’d add up.

Andy was into Malone for five grand he couldn’t pay. Christene starts dating Costa, a rival loan shark. They get hot and heavy, hot enough for Costa to buy her an Alfa Romeo. Enrique talking about forever.

Could be Christene played Costa—used him to take out Malone, to clear Andy’s debt. But maybe Costa caught on. Maybe he realized he was being played, and decided to take out Andy. Something to consider, anyway.

For now, Tom figured he should talk to Angel. Andy’s current squeeze. Andy was killed in her apartment—if she knew something, it was time to hear it.

He gave Steve a call.

“Anything on Angel? Andy’s girlfriend?” Tom asked.

“Nothing much,” Steve replied. “A couple arrests for fighting with customers. Broke a bottle of champagne over one guy’s head. Both were married—neither one wanted to press charges.”

“Thanks. I’ll remember to mind my manners when I go see her.”

“Surprised you’re still on the case. What gives?”

“Christene wants me to help find the murderer,” Tom said. “Figured I’d see what Angel knows.”

The L.A. sun was blazing again—hot enough to turn skin red on contact.

Tom pulled up in front of Angel’s apartment. He knocked on the door, not knowing what to expect.

Angel opened it in nothing but panties and a bra. Tom wasn’t expecting that.

“Come on in,” she said. She’d clearly been drinking.

“Angel, we’ve got to talk,” Tom said. “But you gotta cover up some.”

“Your loss, then,” she laughed, before starting to cry. She pulled on a short silk robe and curled up on the edge of the couch. 

“So who do you think killed Andy?” he asked. “How can you help me?”

“I think she killed him. Or got her boyfriend to do it. She still wanted him and was pissed that I had him. Now no one’s got him.” Angel’s voice cracked, then broke down into sobs.

Tom sat quietly. When she finally stopped crying, he asked, “How about Malone’s crew? Any of them been coming around?”

“No,” she sniffled. “Andy said if he couldn’t pay, he’d have to work collections full time until he paid it off. Something he wasn’t thrilled about.”

She wiped her nose, then looked up at him.

“Hey, Cop,” she said, voice low. “I could use someone to comfort me.”

She dropped the robe and walked to the bed. “If you’re not gonna take me up on it, then shut the door on your way out.”

Tom hesitated. She was gorgeous, no denying that. But the whole thing was too weird. Too raw. Too wrong.

He pulled the door shut behind him.

Chapter 8

Tom pulled up to the Stardust Lounge on Hollywood and Vine.
His contact, Rusty—a man of alleys and whispers—could usually be counted on for solid intel.

He found Rusty playing a slot machine tucked in the back. Tom interrupted.
“We gotta talk, my friend.”

Rusty, always eager for a chance to win back his losses, followed Tom to a booth in the shadows.

“What can you tell me about the case I’m on?” Tom asked, sliding into the seat. “Any idea who killed Malone? How it all ties in?”

Tom slipped him a ten.

Rusty gave him a look. “Come on, Tom. I could use a twenty.”

“Let me hear what you got first.”

Rusty leaned in. “A stripper’s been bragging her boyfriend took out Malone over a five-grand debt he couldn’t pay. Then yesterday, the boyfriend gets taken out. Pretty open and shut.”

“What’s her name?”

Rusty smirked. “Come on, Tom. Like you don’t know already.”

“That it?” Tom asked.

“Yeah. Word is they were waiting for a P.I. to leave the apartment last night before taking him out for Malone. But by the time they got upstairs, he was already dead. Saw the girlfriend running away. Looks like she took him out for them.”

Tom pushed a twenty across the table and hustled out.
He was worried about Christene—and Angel’s vengeance.

Now Angel was alone, furious, and spiraling. And if she thought Christene was the reason Andy slipped through her fingers, she’d be next.

Tom gunned the engine of his Buick and headed for the hills. He had to get to Christene before Angel did.

Chapter 9

Tom’s Ford roared to a halt in Christene’s driveway.
The Hills were dark—like a cave inviting terror.
From inside, he could hear Angel screaming, unhinged.

He drew his .38 and burst through the front door.

Angel stood with Andy’s gun trained on Christene. Costa’s lifeless body lay sprawled on the floor. She had shot him while he reached for his weapon.

“I killed Malone for Andy because he couldn’t pay his five-grand debt,” Angel shouted, eyes wild. “You’d think he’d have chosen me. But I heard you two talking about getting back together. So now I’m going to put you back together—in Hell.”

“Angel, stop. Put the gun down. It’s me—Tom. I don’t want to hurt you. Just drop the gun and talk to me.”

“That’s all you ever want to do—talk,” she sneered. “I’m going to kill her, Tom. Then you can kill me. A perfect end to this pathetic triangle.”

A loud bang tore through the air.

Angel jerked back. A bullet struck her square in the chest. She dropped the gun and crumpled to the floor beside Costa.

Christene had made her move while Angel was distracted by Tom’s pleading. She had reached for Costa’s gun and fired.

Now she stood trembling, staring at the two bodies at her feet.

Tom grabbed a blanket off the leather couch and wrapped it around her shoulders.

“You had to do it, Christene,” he said softly. “She was going to kill you.”

He reached for the phone and called Steve Foley.

“Get down here, Steve. It’s over.”

A web of betrayal, jealousy, and revenge had finally unraveled—with only one survivor left to tell the story.

1kymuzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kymuzn/muffys_day_when_arthur_was_fired/,Muffy's day when Arthur was fired,"Muffy woke up to the gentle California sunshine filtering through her La Jolla window. It was 6:30 AM, and a sense of serene anticipation washed over her. Unlike some of her friends, cough, Tanya, cough, Muffy genuinely loved her job. Being a therapist at Trumpet Behavioral Health, working with kids and their families, was her calling.

She stretched, then padded downstairs in her bunny slippers. A fine layer of dust coated the screen of her TV. As she swiped at it with a cloth, a sneeze erupted, scattering the dust motes back into the air. Downstairs, she poured herself a bowl of multi-grain cereal. Forget milk; she was a dry cereal enthusiast, a secret shame she harbored from the world.

While crunching, she watched a show about different neighborhoods, absorbing the architecture and the community vibes. Soon, she changed into her work clothes – comfortable slacks and a bright, cheerful blouse. She believed in dressing the part of a happy, supportive presence.

Muffy arrived at Trumpet Behavioral Health right on time, a feat she attributed to her meticulous planning. She found her coworker, Maya, by the coffee machine.

""Morning, sunshine,"" Muffy greeted her, grabbing a mug. ""Ready to tackle another day?""

Maya groaned good-naturedly. ""As ready as I'll ever be. What's new with you?""

That was all the invitation Muffy needed. She launched into a nostalgic tale, a vivid recollection of her life back in El Paso, Texas, some fifteen years ago.

""You wouldn't believe the Connections Community at Radford,"" she began, her eyes twinkling. ""Mr. Haughton, bless his heart, he was the mastermind. He formed it with Mr. Faucet, Ms. Waterfountain, and Mr. Otis. Oh, and there was one more… I can't quite remember… anyway!""

Maya chuckled, sensing a story brewing.

""Every morning, before the bell even thought about ringing, we'd all meet in the administrative offices. And we had to say a pledge, every morning, about being a 'Connectate.' It was so corny, but so endearing.""

Muffy’s voice picked up pace. ""And Mohmen! Oh, Mohmen was something else. He had this walkie-talkie, this ancient brick of a thing. Mr. Haughton, in a moment of… inspired madness, had Mohmen turn it into the school bell system. So Mohmen would, like, broadcast announcements and do funny voices. It was chaos!""

Maya burst out laughing. Muffy sneezed, perhaps from the pollen wafting in from the nearby window.

""It didn't last long,"" Muffy continued. ""Some teacher, probably fed up with the anarchy, took down the whole setup. It was literally just a computer and a speaker, no monitor even! But then, on the third floor, which was exclusively for the Connections Community, we managed to commandeer a school computer and hook the bell system back up.""

""Mohmen would even bring chairs from somewhere – I never knew where! – for the administration to sit on. It was…organized chaos, I guess?""

Maya was now practically doubled over with laughter.

""That’s not all!"" Muffy added, her voice rising with amusement. ""At one point, Mr. Haughton had to move his office to the backstage of the auditorium. There weren’t any available rooms, and the board didn't want him to have his own dedicated space! Can you believe that?""

Maya gasped, tears welling in her eyes. ""You are making this up!""

""I swear, it's all true! And one of Mohmen's peers asked him why he was always hanging out in the supply closet. We realized he was trying to learn how to be an electrician!""

Maya’s laughter was so loud that their supervisor, Stephanie, poked her head into the office.

""What's all the commotion?"" Stephanie asked, a smile playing on her lips.

""Muffy's telling stories about her high school,"" Maya managed to sputter, wiping her eyes.

Muffy, ever the performer, simply launched back into her tale, embellishing the details with each telling.

""Why was the Connections Community formed in the first place?"" Stephanie inquired, intrigued.

Muffy's face softened. ""It was for the kids who didn't quite fit in, the ones who were a little lost and lonely. It's how I met all my friends, actually. Well, most of them. Mohmen was the first to join, then DW, then Arthur, then me, then Francine.""

Maya shook her head, still chuckling. ""This is unbelievable.""

""What caused it to form?"" Maya asked.

Muffy took on a serious tone. ""Mohmen was advocating for it because no one liked him. It was his way of creating a space where people like him could belong. And if any of us decided to leave or get kicked out, Mr. Haughton would issue a trespass order.""

Just then, the doorbell chimed, announcing the arrival of Rosa, Muffy’s first client. Muffy straightened up, her face shifting into a warm, professional demeanor.

""That's my cue,"" she said. ""Wish me luck.""

In no time, Rosa’s child was calm and walked inside holding Angel's hand. It was wonderful to see Angel's patience and genuine care make such a difference.",1,1748554345.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1kyms28,https://www.reddit.com/r/WigTalk/comments/1kyms28/finally_a_solution_to_the_where_can_i_buysell/,"FINALLY - A Solution to the ""Where Can I Buy/Sell Premium Wigs?"" Question We Get Daily","Hey WigTalk fam! 👋

Can we talk about how frustrating the wig marketplace situation has become? I swear we get asked ""where's the best place to buy/sell and trade wigs?"" at least 5 times a week, and honestly... the answer has been pretty disappointing.

**The Problem We ALL Know Too Well:**

* Facebook groups full of scammers with stolen photos
* eBay flooded with cheap knockoffs labeled as ""premium brands""
* Mercari sellers who ghost you after payment
* No way to verify if that $800 Jon Renau is actually authentic
* Getting burned by sellers who promise ""like new"" and deliver something that looks like it survived a tornado

Sound familiar? Yeah, we thought so.

**Here's What We Did About It:**

After getting tired of watching our community members get scammed and frustrated, we decided to build something different. Not another open marketplace where anyone can post anything, but a **members-only sanctuary** for serious wig enthusiasts.

**Introducing** [**WigConnection.com**](http://WigConnection.com) \- the first marketplace built BY wig lovers, FOR wig lovers.

**What Makes This Different:**

🛡️ **Every Single Member is Verified** \- No more dealing with faceless accounts or wondering if ""SarahWig2024"" is actually a scammer in Belarus. Real people, real verification, real peace of mind.

💎 **Premium Brands Only** \- Jon Renau, Ellen Wille, Raquel Welch, Gabor, Belle Tress, and other quality brands. No knockoffs, no mystery manufacturers, no ""looks just like expensive brand"" nonsense.

🔒 **Actual Security** \- Built-in communication tools, user ratings, transaction history. You can see exactly who you're dealing with and their track record.

📱 **User Experience That Doesn't Suck** \- Upload multiple photos, write detailed descriptions, track who's interested. No more ""is this still available?"" messages on 6-month-old posts.

**The Real Game Changer:** This is a COMMUNITY, not just a marketplace. Everyone here understands that a $600 wig deserves respect, proper care, and honest representation.

**Membership Investment:** Yes, there's a small subscription fee. That's literally the point - it keeps out the tire-kickers, scammers, and people who don't value quality pieces. Think of it as the cost of one coffee per month to access a scammer-free zone.

**Beta Launch Status:** We're starting small with verified members only. Quality over quantity from day one.

If you're tired of marketplace roulette and want to buy/sell with people who actually GET why we invest in premium pieces, check it out: [**WigConnection.com**](http://WigConnection.com)",1,1748554150.0,WigTalk,0,1.0,False

(trigger warning: grooming, abuse, manipulation)","Hey Reddit, I'm throwing this out into the void because I don't know where else to go.I'm 19 now, but this happened when I was 16. I met ""Liam"" at a local coffee shop. He was 29, older and seemed so sophisticated. He was charming, funny, and actually listened when I talked about my boring teenage life. He made me feel like I was the most interesting person in the world.
He started coming to the coffee shop everyday  ( I always went there after school with my friends or by myself) he always was finding a way to sit near me. Complimenting my drawings, asking about my school, just...being there. Soon, we were exchanging numbers, texting late into the night. My friends thought he was way too old for me, but I was blinded by the attention. He told me I was mature for my age, different from other girls. That's what they all say, right?
It escalated quickly. Secret dates, sneaking around. The guilt ate at me, but he was so good at making me feel like it was us against the world. He told me he'd never felt this way about anyone, that age was just a number. I believed him. I really, truly believed him.
Things changed after a few months. The compliments turned into criticisms. He became possessive, constantly checking my phone, accusing me of talking to other guys. He isolated me from my friends, telling me they were jealous of our relationship. The sweet, attentive Liam disappeared, replaced by someone controlling and angry.
The worst part? He knew how vulnerable I was. He knew I had issues with my dad, and he used that to manipulate me, positioning himself as the father figure I never had. He took away my innocence, my self-worth, everything.
I finally broke things off a year later, but the damage was done. I'm in therapy now, trying to unpack all the trauma. Some days are good, some days I can barely get out of bed. I still struggle with trust, with feeling like I'm worthy of love.
I guess I'm posting this because I want other young girls to be aware. If someone older is giving you too much attention, making you feel special in a way that feels…off…please, please talk to someone. Don't make the same mistake I did. It's not worth it. You are worth so much more. Thanks for listening, Reddit. I just needed to get that off my chest

Not an alarm. Not a dream. Just the world’s loudest garbage truck, crashing my sleep party at 3:30AM. It parked outside the corner store like it was auditioning for a demolition derby, slamming bins and doing that “BEEP BEEP BEEP” reverse thing loud enough to rattle thoughts loose. I wanted to yell my own censored beeps right back at it.

I tried to salvage sleep on the couch. That went nowhere. Thank God for my backup laptop and some early morning TV to stop the spiral into “why am I awake?” madness.

The War on Ants Has Begun
Today marked the first official battle. I took out the trash and caught them red-handed—ants. Everywhere. I had already done a vinegar perimeter with the kind of 30% stuff that could probably strip paint off a tank, but these little freaks just saw it as a spicy welcome mat.

So we escalated. Walmart run. Twelve ant traps loaded with Borax-based doom. I’ve tried diplomacy. I’ve tried environmental disruption (shoutout to diatomaceous earth). Now I’m going full chemical warfare. They’ve got numbers. I’ve got funds, caffeine, and the internet.

Work, Weirdly Decent Today
Even on 3-ish hours of sleep, today flew. My coffee hadn’t even cooled before tickets were rolling in. One of my managers asked for a tiny Slack automation—emoji help for logging into UpToDate. Knocked that out. People were happy. I like those quick wins.

Later I had a meeting with Sean, and here’s the big revelation: upper management doesn’t hide things from him… they just don’t tell him. Which honestly explains a lot. I used to think there was this veil of secrecy. Turns out it’s just your classic trickle-down confusion.

Also found out Athena training might be dead in the water. The CSA folks are leaving our side of the company (Vera/Castlight) and going to Mosaic. No CSA = no one to train us on Athena. We also might be morphing into a backup call center for other groups. Not mad about it—but anytime the helpdesk shifts shape like this, I start dusting off my resume. Just in case.

Final Thought
Sleep-deprived Jeff is running on caffeine, spite, and tech wizardry. The ants should fear me. Corporate should maybe just send updates to all the managers. That’s all I ask.",1,1748553775.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

I am moving this September - the thing I have not settled on is where I am going! I am from southeastern KY, went to college in Louisville KY, and have spent the past 2 years in Chicago - moved here on a whim out of school. I’m ready for a change and the possibilities overwhelm me. I’ve done a brain-numbing amount of research but still feel stuck on deciding, so I thought I’d turn to you lovely folks for lived experience to factor into my considerations

I’m 23 (she/her) and WFH in the nonprofit finance space (earning $80k+). There’s a lot I have loved about Chicago, but some lacking. I love the population density and life of the communities/neighborhoods - you can find something happening anywhere, any day. I adore the neighborhood walkability, bikeability, transitability, etc. and know this is something I’ll miss most places I might move in the US. I also love the opportunities to meet people, join communities: fitness classes, art classes, social groups, stranger events, etc. I am a big coffee shop gal and love the endless coffee shops to explore. I also love the abundance of food options.

The things most lacking to me are: access to nature and warmth. I miss being near the mountains, lakes, and having wildlife and woods so near. I thrive on warmth and sunshine and the lack of those for most of the year here is brutal to me. I love to hike, bike, kayak and would love to live somewhere closer to abundant parks, botanical gardens, nature, mountains, beach, or some mix of. 

Ideally, I’d love to merge my love for the arts, music, events, cafes, restaurants, community, and vibrancy with nature access and warmer/sunnier weather. City size/overall population is not as important to me as long as I am in a particularly vibrant/lively, community-oriented, and bikeable/walkable area/neighborhood. I also would ideally love to live somewhere more left-leaning, or at least with significant leftist communities/niches as I know this will be hard particularly in the south and southeast. I am also not bound by my job or other obligations so can move anywhere in the US! 

Places I’ve been researching/considering to varying degrees: Denver, Portland, Seattle, Atlanta, Charleston, DC, Asheville, Chattanooga, Raleigh, Austin, Phoenix, Greenville, Richmond VA, Charlottesville ",1,1748553743.0,SameGrassButGreener,3,0.99,False

A certain fandom consumed me body and soul a couple of decades back.  I wrote over 500,000 words in fanfics, including collaborating with my Mum on my 350K+ word magnum opus when I was a law student in 2004-2005.  It was well-received, getting over 6000 reviews! Along with that, I damn well *worshipped* the author.  At a study abroad session in London in 2005, I went to all the sites, and sometimes sat in coffee shops writing my stories just like the author had once done.  

But in the past five years, I've seen that same author engage in continuing, escalating, open, and downright *gleeful* activism to oppress and torment an already-vulnerable and marginalized community, devoting a fanmade fortune to funding bigoted legislation and her public voice to cruel harassment.

I had already withdrawn from most fandom activities as a result, but today as I saw she's created and funding yet another organization for this vile ""cause"", I decided there was one final step that I needed to take.

All those fanfics, those labors of love for the content and for my fellow fans over so many hours, days, months, and years spent writing and discussing and sharing, for which I still get reviews,  I've decided to delete the fics.  On my conscience, I can't continue to do anything that encourages or inspires people to consume this author's content.

It's breaking my heart.  I'm saving the reviews pages as I go, making myself cry as I do it.  I never would've thought to see this day back in those days.  Writing those fics helped me get through the brutality of law school and the very rough first years I spent as a practicing lawyer. 

Even the fics I wrote nearly 30 years ago that I think are cringe nowadays, I've never been able to make myself delete.  They're so full of memories, both of the writing process and engaging with readers.  

I don't understand how it came to this. No doubt some will huff that it's silly to delete my beloved fics for ""political reasons"", but it is so much more than that.  I'm not a member of the community the author is targeting, but it doesn't matter.  Bigotry is bigotry, and trying to legislate bigotry into law and using it as a weapon to harass and intimidate already-vulnerable people is something that I can't tolerate even passively.

I've been reading up on its construction and development, looking for the reason its heritage significance is so understated. Some historians assert this is related to the lack of Bonifacio's mortal remains (unlike the Quezon Memorial Shrine, the Rizal Monument). Others link it to how Bonifacio has been appropriated by dissident political groups and movements, something the government doesn't want to encourage. Of course, it's also so centrally located it's become very commercialized, to the detriment of the heritage site.

In 2002, the mayor at the time even proposed to transfer it to North Caloocan to make way for a possible connection between the LRT-2 and MRT-3. While this sparked outrage among those who claimed its location is integral to it and that National Artist Guillermo Tolentino's work should be respected, some wanted it to be relocated to Luneta. This would have upset the balance since the Bonifacio Monument is taller than the Rizal Monument by a meter. But it doesn't matter because the NHCP, then the NHI, declared it a National Historical Landmark later that year and effectively shut down any talk of relocation.

I love sinking into a long book at home, but in my daily life - over coffee, waiting around, or on my commute - I rarely have more than 10–20 minutes to spare. Me and my friend got to wondering: what if there were complete romance stories you could read in a single coffee break? A full love story arc that’s sweet, satisfying, and wraps up before your latte goes cold and it just take 10-20 minutes to read. ☕️💕

I wanted to get some insight from others who take stimulant medications — especially Adderall — about heart-related side effects.

I’m currently on Adderall to help manage my focus. I’ve tried other meds, but this one has been the most consistently effective, though I do experience some side effects like occasional anxiety and trouble sleeping. I also sometimes drink caffeine with it — usually in the form of matcha, light coffee, or a caffeine pill (not all at once, of course).

What I’ve noticed is that my resting heart rate, which is normally around 70 bpm, tends to go up to 100–115 bpm after taking my medication. My psychiatrist had me get an EKG and bloodwork, and thankfully everything came back normal — no signs of a heart condition. I’m 25, generally healthy and active, and don’t eat a high-sodium or heavily processed diet.

That said, I still wonder if the elevated heart rate — even if it’s medically “safe” right now — could have long-term consequences for my cardiovascular health.

Have others experienced similar heart rate changes? Did it ever turn into something more serious for you down the line? Would love to hear your experiences, and if you’ve found any ways to manage this side effect without sacrificing focus.

Thanks in advance!

**Chapter One: Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham**

Once upon a long time ago, situated in a majestic group of mountains, there was a quaint little village named Willowbrook. It is one of the many situated in the majestic and beautiful land of Alexandria. A kingdom where the summers are not too hot, and the winters are not too cold. A land filled with beautiful lakes, deep forests, and glorious fields filled with delicious crops and gorgeous wildflowers to provide plenty of food for the glad people in this wondrous land. Living comfortably in this pleasant village was the wonderful Cunningham family. William Cunningham is the most successful businessman in Willowbrook. He has lived in Willowbrook for the last thirty years and owns and runs multiple businesses in and around the village. He owns the village general store where… He owns and runs the village hotel where… He owns and runs the fanciest restaurant in Willowbrook, where the menu never stays the same. It is situated inside the hotel, where he can provide many different meals for the hotel guests and village locals. He calls the restaurant “The Enchanted Sisters” after his two beautiful daughters. He owns the village lumber yard where… He owns and runs the old village apple orchard and cider mill where thousands of delicious apples, pears, peaches, and oranges are handpicked from the hundreds of fruit trees that grow on the land near the mill and throughout the grassy plains near the village entrance. These fruits are then taken to the mill, where they are transformed and created into different goods to sell at the general store or served at the restaurant.

Mr. William Cunningham is a tall, strong, and handsome middle-aged man with dark brown hair and bright green eyes. His kindness spreads to everyone he meets, works with, and cares for in and around all his businesses. He goes by many different names, such as Sir, Mister, or Mr. Cunningham. However, the locals always call him William or Will. He is a man who likes to keep busy and likes to be moving all the time. As busy as he is with running all his businesses, he is also finishing his final manuscript for a cookbook he has been working on for the last ten years. A cookbook on how to make different kinds of bread and the tricks to baking them perfectly every single time without fail. He hopes to get it published and distributed throughout all of Alexandria. After a long day of work, he can usually be found in his favorite armchair near a roaring fireplace reading a good book.

He and his wife Ruth have been married for almost twenty-five years, and he always says he has been the happiest man in the world since he met her. Ruth Cunningham is a beautiful and talented woman whom everyone in the village has come to admire and respect. She is tall with long black hair and dark brown eyes. Besides helping William with all his businesses, Ruth is also the village midwife and has a small office in the village doctor’s clinic. The clinic is located right next door to the hotel, so that if someone in the hotel or restaurant needs medical attention, they can receive it in no time at all.

Ruth and William have twin daughters named Cynthia and Ophelia. Ruth loves her husband and daughters with all her heart, and she often daydreams of the wonderful things they have done and could do since she and William started building their family sixteen years ago. On a cold night in December, Ruth gave birth to identical twin daughters, whom they named Cynthia and Ophelia. Each of them was unique, even though they were identical. Cynthia was born with dark black hair but bright blue eyes. She is the oldest of the twins by three minutes. Ophelia was born with bright blonde hair but had dark, violet-colored eyes.

**Chapter Two: Cynthia & Ophelia Cunningham**

**Chapter Three: An Emergency Delivery**

One night during a heavy rainstorm, the Cunninghams were closing the store and restaurant up for the evening. Suddenly, a stagecoach came rushing up to the front of the hotel from out of nowhere. The frantic coachman quickly jumped down off his coach and yelled for help.

>

They all rushed over to the coach and saw the young woman having a difficult time breathing, and saw that she was bleeding heavily from a wound on her abdomen. Being the most amazing midwife that she is, Ruth acted quickly by asking William and the coachman, who introduced himself as Barney Franklinstine, to carry the young woman into the clinic. Ruth then began to ask the struggling mom some important questions.

>

The men brought her into the clinic and placed her on a bed in an empty room.

>

The woman continued to have a difficult time breathing, and her labor began to intensify.

>

When Ruth asked this, the woman took a short, labored breath and answered her.

>

Ruth asked William and Barney to go outside to give Danielle some privacy. They did so, and William gave Barney some coffee to warm himself up and told him that he could stay at the hotel overnight while the storm passed. Ruth, Cynthia, and Ophelia prepared Danielle for a hard, difficult delivery. The girls would run back and forth, getting the things their mother and the village doctor needed. The village doctor, Dr. Augustus Brown, helped and encouraged Danielle through the contractions, and Ruth coached her in the delivery. After a long six hours of hard labor, everyone finally heard the cry of a healthy baby. The girls helped clean the newborn, bundled it up to keep it warm, and handed the child to Ruth. Ruth then handed the child to Danielle to hold for the first time. Danielle smiled down at her newborn child, looked up at Ruth, and said,

>

Suddenly, Danielle passed out and stopped breathing altogether. Ruth handed the baby back to Cynthia, and she began to help the doctor treat Danielle to revive her. After a few moments of struggle, they were able to save Danielle from death, but it came with some terrible consequences. Yes, Danielle is alive physically, but she becomes nonverbal and childlike herself. She couldn’t speak and didn’t know who she was or the fact that she had just had a baby. Dr. Brown explained to the girls that while she was unconscious, her brain did somewhat of reset, and when she woke up, she lost some of her present memories. He instructed Ruth, William, and the girls never to tell Danielle that the child is hers, never to leave the child with her, and to take care of her and the newborn, for she would now need someone to depend on, for she was like a child herself now.

**Chapter Four: Delilah Cunningham**

The baby, a little red-headed girl like Danielle, was adopted by the Cunningham’s and they gave Danielle a room in the attic of the hotel and a job with housekeeping at the hotel. For her protection, they placed a small bell around her waist every day, so they knew where she was because she tended to wander off sometimes. Now, Cynthia and Ophelia had a baby sister, whom the family decided to name Delilah in honor of her birth mother, Danielle. After sixteen years, Delilah has grown into a beautiful, spirited young woman. Eventually, a few years ago, the Cunninghams told Delilah about Danielle and what had happened on that stormy night. Delilah understood and thanked them for adopting her and taking care of Danielle. The three girls went everywhere together and did everything together. Cynthia and Ophelia continued to work in the hotel, restaurant, and bakery, having more responsibilities than before, while Delilah finished her final year at the village school. Life was simple, but all of that was about to change.

**Chapter Five: Life-Changing Circumstances**

One evening, after picking Delilah up from school, the three girls were walking in the direction of the general store when they saw a lot of people standing outside the hotel and restaurant entrance.

>

>

The village chairman, a short, fluffy man named Mr. Gabriel Rogers, ran up to the girls before they could get any closer to the crowd.

>

The girls gasped in horror, and Delilah began to weep. Ophelia held her tight and assured her that everything would be alright. As they began to walk to the scene, Mr. Rogers continued with the facts.

>

The girls walked up to the hotel and saw the doctor treating William. William was so upset about the attack that all he did was sit silently in a hotel armchair, refusing to speak to anyone. Cynthia walked over to him and the doctor, with Ophelia and Delilah close behind her.

>

>

Cynthia helped the doctor place a sling on her father’s arm and told the doctor they would make sure he rested it. The girls took William home and laid him in his bed. For the next three days, which is where William slept without talking to them. He wouldn’t eat or drink anything at all, only feeling sorry for himself and disappointed he couldn’t protect Ruth and Danielle from being kidnapped. All he would do was sit in a chair in the room, look out the window, and stare out all day, wishing to see his precious Ruth once more. Three weeks later, the chairman and his men still couldn’t find anything else that could lead them to the villains who attacked William. No clue whether or not Ruth and Danielle were alive, but he told the girls not to lose hope that they were alive. The case got cold, and after another two weeks, there were still no leads.

**Chapter Six: Doing What Is Best**

William’s health continued to get worse as he barely ate anything and did not speak a word to anyone. The girls wanted so much to see Ruth and Danielle return safely and to see William happy once again. So, they sat together one night with their father and had a long discussion about their future and what they thought was the best thing to do. After much deliberation and discussion, the Cunninghams decided to leave Willowbrook and head to the capital city of Dapplewood; the great center of Alexandria, where the great king Frederick Alexander and his lovely wife Queen Josephine Elizabeth lived. Maybe they could help them with their case and find Danielle and Ruth. They left the hotel, restaurant, store, bakery, and the other of William’s businesses to the chairman to oversee for this difficult time they are gone. The chairman and other people of Willowbrook began helping them pack up their belongings for their long journey. They were sad and a bit surprised to see them leave but understood why and wished them well and a safe journey. As they began their journey to the capital, Cynthia would sing songs, Ophelia would tell or read stories, and Delilah would remind them of happy, joyful, and silly times they had had. William would smile occasionally but would still never say a word. Cynthia proudly told her father, “We are going to find Mama, Papa! We promise. We will find them both in no time!” Once they arrived in Dapplewood a week later, they bought a small cottage on the edge of the capital. They moved in their belongings and began to make the small house into a home. The cottage had two bedrooms, a large kitchen, and a great living room space. Perfect for the four of them to start a new life. The girls put their father into the smallest of the two bedrooms and the three of them were set to share the other slightly larger room. Cynthia and Ophelia had beds in two of the corners while Delilah slept in a bed above them in a loft. Once settled into their new home, the girls went right to work. Cynthia began to write down their entire dilemma in full detail, so they might present it to the king himself. Ophelia cared for their father who seemed to drift further away as the days went by, barely eating anything at all. She introduced herself to the local doctor, Dr. Edward Jacobson, so they may call upon him when their father is in need. Dr. Edward went to examine William that same day and instructed him to eat better and to get plenty of sunshine. He warned the girls of his declining health, and they told him they would do their best. Delilah helped by keeping the house clean, making sure everything was in its place, and assisting Cynthia and Ophelia when they needed extra help or even a tea break.

**Chapter Seven: Off To The Palace**

After three days of non-stop work, Cynthia had finished writing their dilemma down and it was ready to present to the king’s court. Dr. Jacobson came to stay with William, whom the girls told the whole story, and their father for the first time since the event, began to tell Dr. Jacobson about his dear Ruth. The girls went off to the palace to present their case to the king. Once the girls arrived at the palace, they requested an audience with the king immediately. They presented a copy of their case to the king’s grand viewer, Sir Arthur Hemmingway, who asked them to wait in the front waiting area near the main palace entrance. While they waited, a servant offered them each a cup of tea and some cakes. They thanked her and dined quietly. After a while, an anxious Delilah asked Ophelia, “Do you think the king will see us, Ophelia?” “I hope so, Delilah. For father’s sake, I hope so.” After two hours of waiting, Sir Arthur walked over to them and said, “I am so sorry to have kept you waiting this long ladies. Please follow me. The King and the rest of the royal family are ready to see you now.” The girls stood up and followed him through many doors and rooms. They were so nervous but ready for any questions the king may have for them. They walked into a grand room filled with books, maps, and scrolls. It also had a juvenile of the known world in the middle of the room along with a miniature replica of Alexandria next to a set of large windows. Cynthia, Ophelia, and Delilah were amazed at the size of the room and all of its wondrous items inside. Past the globe sitting at a large table that was covered in piles of maps, scrolls, and piles of other reports was the royal family. The King, the queen, and their three sons; the royal princes of Alexandria. Sir Arthur instructed the girls to wait a few feet away while he approached the king to introduce them. “Excuse me, your amenities. These young ladies are here with a case in which they have traveled from Willowbrook to ask you for your immediate assistance. It is a matter of life and death, my highness.” The girls stepped forward and bowed before the elegant royal family. The King was quite taken with the girl’s manners and asked them to rise. “Hello, young ladies. What is your case that you have traveled so far to present to me? Please have a seat and tell us about your dilemma.” Cynthia presented another full copy of their written case and explained what had happened to their parents and Danielle. When the queen heard these details, she gasped in horror and asked, “Are you the only children of William and Ruth Cunningham?” “Ophelia and I are their biological twin daughters, but Delilah here is adopted.” Cynthia continued by explaining the events that happened the night Delilah was born and how her father was kidnapped, and her mother was injured. She explained that it was in the same manner as the robbery at the hotel with Danielle and their mother Ruth’s kidnapping. No witnesses, no clues, and a single stabbing attack. The King stood to his feet and said, “We shall begin the investigation immediately.” Everyone else stood up as the king walked around the table to where his sons were. “Now may I introduce to you, own sons. This is our oldest son; Edward, our middle son; Nicolas, and our youngest son; Richard.” The princes bowed to the girls and the girls gladly bowed to them in return. “Now, my boys. Please escort these lovely ladies home. It is too dark out for such polite young people to be walking home. Give our regards to your father and let him know that the investigation has begun.” The girls and princes bowed to the king and queen, and the three handsome princes escorted the girls out of the room and into an elegant coach that was ready to take them home back to their cottage. When they arrived back at the cottage, Prince Edward asked Cynthia if he could speak to her father on the king’s behalf. At that moment, Dr. Jacobson bowed to the royalist and left William in his daughter’s care. Cynthia introduced her father to Prince Edward and his brothers. William thanked him and his brothers for bringing the girls back home safely. Edward told William that the investigation to find Ruth and Danielle had begun. Prince Edward then asked, “Sir William, my brothers and I would be honored if you and your lovely daughters would join us for dinner. Would tomorrow night be alright?” The girls smiled, and William accepted the invention and thanked them for everything they were doing for him and his family. The three princes smiled back at the girls, and Prince Edward told them they would arrive to fetch them tomorrow afternoon around five o’clock.

Chapter Eight: Dinner At The Palace

Chapter Nine: Another Life-Changing Circumstances

As they were riding home, the coachman told the princes about a strange glow shining over the next hill near where the cottage would be. As they drove over the hill, they saw that the range glow was their sweet little cottage was on fire. Delilah began to cry, while William just stared into the flames as they destroyed their home. We are now, truly lost, he said with bated breath. That’s not true, Father. We still have each other. Plus, if we were not at the palace for dinner, we might be worse off. Edward, Nicholas, and Richard knew right away what they had to do. Edward signaled the driver, and they took William and the girls back to the palace where they would be safe from any other further trouble. Once they were all back at the palace, they told the king and queen what had happened to the cottage. The queen hugged them all and stated, “Of course, you should stay here. It will be best for everyone, and you will be protected here.” The queen escorted them to a private suite where there were four large bedrooms grouped by a grand living hall filled with tables, desks, and comfortable couches to sit on. It was like a house inside the palace, and then some. The girls put their father in the bedroom that was themed around the color brown, and he slept hard for the rest of the night. Cynthia slept in the blue bedroom that looked like an ocean underwater world. Ophelia was in the purple room that looked like she was living in a cloud. Delilah was in the green room that looked like an enchanted forest filled with trees and animals. William slept for the next three days and became quite ill due to his refusal to eat or drink anything. Dr. Jacobson and a few other doctors came many times to treat William, but the only curse was if he ate something and drank some water. The doctors told the girls that it was the worst case of a broken heart he had seen in their combined forty years of practice. Soon, with the king and queen’s help, they were finally able to get William to eat and drink something for his daughter’s sake.

**Chapter Ten: Life At The Palace**

Life in the palace became quiet after the fire. The King and William spent most of the time together, figuring out more clues about the kidnappings, stabbings, and the cottage fire. The queen and Cynthia spent most of their time together talking in the royal parlor or as they walked through the castle halls. They would share recipes, and Cynthia would tell the queen that she was hoping to see her mother again, but the queen was so kind that she reminded Cynthia of her mother. Ophelia and Delilah spent most of their time in the library, reading books and studying maps. When the weather was nice, the two of them would be in the royal stables, grooming and riding some of the horses. In the evenings, they all had dinner together in the grand dining hall and talked all about what they did or discovered that day. Once dinner was finished, the girls would dance with the princes until it was time to retire for the night. The girls were enjoying their new life at the palace, and they loved seeing how much their father was improving every day, discovering new clues that may lead to the return of Danielle and his beloved Ruth. As the weeks went by and they spent more time with the princes, their hearts were full, and they felt completely at home. The six of them were so comfortable together. Edward was falling in love with Cynthia, and Cynthia was with him. Nicolas was falling in love with Ophelia, and Ophelia was with him. Richard was falling in love with Delilah, and Delilah was with him. William was so glad to see his girls finding love during these difficult times. After a few months, the king and his men made many interesting developments in the case and discovered the person behind the robberies, stabbings, kidnapping, and cottage fire. It was the king’s own jealous, exiled younger brother, Jacob Godfrey. He was banished to the Umberwood Mountains after he tried to kill the king before Edward was born and secured his position with a ligament heir. But the question remains… Why, after all these years, has he attacked these innocent people? The King brought the queen, his sons, the girls, and William together and updated them on their findings. When the king finished, Cynthia began to ask questions. What does any of this have to do with us? Why did he target us? Why did he kidnap Danielle and our mother? Why stab our father? What does it have to do with us? The King looked at William and said, “William, it is time to tell them everything. The girls looked all confessed and looked at their father.

**Chapter Eleven: William's Confession**

William took a deep breath and began to explain the whole story. “When I was much younger, before I was this successful businessman, I am today, and way before I met your mother, I was a knight here in his majesty’s royal guard.” Ophelia and Delilah’s jaws dropped, and everyone moved in closer and sat down while William continued. “I was even promoted to Captain of the Guard and would be the Grand Knight, meaning I would oversee the other knights and those who were put in prison or sentenced to life in the dungeons. I also oversaw the palace security team.” The girls were so surprised and gasped at him as he continued with his tale. “It was during the time of Jacobs’s attack that would test not only me but every knight in his majesty’s royal guard. When he attempted to murder the king, I was the one who defeated him and ended the attack. He was brought before the court and sentenced to life in exile. With the help of four other knights, we escorted him to the base of the Umberwood Mountains. I was responsible for getting him there and making sure he stayed there. As we left him, he shouted back threats at me, the other knights, and the royal family. He said he would make everyone pay.” William stood to his feet, walked over to a large window, looked out at the setting sun, and continued his story. “After a few years, three of the other knights who took Jacob to the mountains; Sir Quincy Robertson, Sir George Youngingshire, and Sir Charles Davidson went missing along with their possessions and families. We were never able to find them or the person who did it. The cases turned cold, but I grew weary knowing I could be next. So, I told the king that I and the other surviving knight, Sir Harry de LaFleur should move away for the safety of the royal family and the kingdom. The hotel, restaurant, store, lumber yard, mill, and recently, the bakery were funded by the king himself. Life was simple, good, and quiet, and I began to feel like I could live without worrying about him finding me. After a few years, I met Ruth and we fell in love. Not long after we met, we were married. Soon after, the twins were born, and I was truly the happiest man on earth. Alas sixteen years later came the night the stage came into town and Delilah’s birth mother Danielle was in labor after being stabbed and robbed. When she told us her name, I knew who she was. Her husband was Sir Harry LaFleur, the other knight who was in hiding like me. He and Danielle were coming to Willowbrook to warn me that the attacks were happening again. After what happened to Danielle the only right thing to do was to adopt Delilah and take in Danielle to protect them too. For the next sixteen years, it was peaceful again, but I was always on edge that another attack was soon upon us. My intuition was right the night of the robbery, and the kidnapping of Danielle and my beloved Ruth. That is why the attackers were unable to hurt me worse than they did, it was in that stab they used to distract me and kidnap Danielle and Ruth. They are being held captive because of my connections and involvement in Jacobs’s defeat, capture, and exile.” The girls huddled around their father and hugged him tightly. Cynthia told him that everything was alright and that he was only doing his duty to protect Alexandria. William was tired and became sad after telling the story because it made him think of Ruth. Everyone else agreed it was time to rest for the night.

**Chapter Twelve: Life-Changing Circumstances For William**

The next morning everyone came down for breakfast, except William. Cynthia went to his room to check on her father and to her surprise found that he would not wake up. She felt his forehead and discovered he was quite feverish. She ran down to the king and asked for the doctors to come right away. The King sent for the doctors who arrived soon after. The royal doctors examined him alongside the king’s most trusted wizard and found he had developed an infection in the shoulder wound. After some medication, tonics, and tests, they discovered the wound was more serious than before. It was suggested that William not be moved from his bed until the fever breaks and the wound hopefully improves. His room was kept quiet, and the doctors and palace staff kept a close visual over him for the next six days. On the seventh day, the doctors warned the girls that if he didn’t improve, they might lose him. The girls passed the halls near his room, trying to produce a solution.",1,1748552651.0,theEichlerChronicles,0,1.0,False

1kym5ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kym5ho/51m_biomedical_engineering_grad_seeking_career/,"51M — Biomedical Engineering Grad Seeking Career Change into Medical Dosimetry, is it advisable?","Hi Reddit,

I’m a 51-year-old male based in Hampton Roads area, seriously considering a career change into medical dosimetry and would appreciate any advice or insight from those in the field or who’ve made similar transitions.

**Background:**

- Education: B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (Tulane University, 2002), GPA 2.683
- Experience:
    - 20 years as a fresh food franchise owner/operator (1997–2017)
    - 6 years abroad exporting coffee (2017–2023)
    - Currently teaching English (ESL) since returning to the U.S.
- Location: Hamptons Roads (willing to relocate temporarily for clinicals)

**My Plan So Far:**

- Finish any missing prereqs (Anatomy/Physiology refresher if needed)
- Apply for JRCERT-accredited medical dosimetry programs
- Sit for the MDCB exam upon graduation (likely 2026)
- Target programs:
    - Johns Hopkins (in-person)
    - University of Wisconsin–La Crosse (online)
    - MD Anderson (hybrid)
    - SIU Carbondale (hybrid)
    - Roswell Park (in-person)

**My Questions:**

1. Am I too old to break into this field?
2. Is my low GPA a big obstacle to get accepted into the above tentative list of programs? Anything I can do to improve my chances if so?
3. Any tips for getting into competitive programs with my background?
4. Are there faster/cheaper but still reputable options I’m missing?

Thankfully, I am more on the financially stable side of things and can afford the tuition fees and can go to school full time. I would however like to attend an online didactic program if possible as well as pursue the fastest route possible.

Any input on how to position myself as a strong candidate to get accepted into any dosimetry program would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks in advance for your time and guidance!",1,1748552607.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1kym0qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hellenism/comments/1kym0qp/i_worry_im_not_taking_my_faith_seriously_enough/,I worry I'm not taking my faith seriously enough...,"My ideal morning routine is to wake up early enough to give Lord Zeus an offering of morning coffee,  say my prayers, and do 30 minutes of Spanish on doulingo as a devotional offering to Lord Hermes.

What usually happens instead. I am a very heavy sleeper and it's very hard for me to wake up. I end up waking up later than I intended and end up rushing to get ready to work. No time for morning offerings or a devotional.  I do usually say a quick prayer,  but that is it.

I feel so bad because I feel like I'm being lazy and not prioritizing the Theoi enough. 

When I get home from work I intend to do devotionals and offerings, but instead I get on my phone or computer and zone out to YouTube or reading a book, and don't do as many or any as I intended too and I don't leave the offering I wanted. Once again at the end of the day I feel guilty.

I tell myself I will read at least an hour of an Ancient Greek or Roman text a day, and instead I zone out on a brain candy romantasy novel that I don't have to think too hard about. I tell myself I'll listen to a Greek mythology podcast or spend time doing research and I don't.

I just wonder if I'm not taking my faith seriously enough and i feel so guilty for it, like I'm failing as a Hellenist. I feel like I'm being lazy and not serious enough about my faith.

I admit one of my biggest personality flaws is that I tend to be a person of extremes and be an all or nothing person. It might have to do with me having the unholy combination of OCD and Autism. I guess when I wake up late and feel like I failed the Theoi, my mind is ruined for the rest of the day to worship.  And the guilt makes it harder to get back on track 

I just feel like I'm being lazy by not honoring the gods, and just feel like I'm a Hellenist imposter at times.

I’m losing my mind.,"Okay so… this is going to be a little ranty, but I need to get it off my chest 🙈 I’ve been obsessed with unlocking the Tofu ending in Coffee Talk Episode 2.

A perfect barista run with all good endings

A bad run with all bad endings

A neutral/normal one (including Hyde’s normal ending)

I let the credits roll every time

I made sure to serve the Light Speed drink


Then I tried again with a second barista profile. Did everything again. Hyde good and normal ending, Lua and Baileys good ending, let the credits roll. Still. No. Tofu.

So I’ve been trying everything to get those last shelf items to trigger and finally see the damn tofu scene.

And now I find out I even triggered the secret ending twice without realizing it. I gave >!the ghost!< a milk, because I thought it was just a cute cat 🙃
I figured it was a teaser for the real secret and I’d need to unlock something else to get the full version. NOPE. That was it. That was the moment.

And here’s what’s driving me absolutely nuts:
The game doesn’t tell you you’ve missed your chance.
Instead, it gives you a cryptic little:
“Maybe there’s something you still haven’t seen.”
Which just makes you keep playing. Over. And. Over.

Like okay—if I messed up? Just say so.
Tell me: “You blew it. Try again.”
Don’t leave me in limbo wondering if I missed a flag or if the game bugged out. That ambiguity isn’t cute—it’s cruel.

I love this game. I really do. But this kind of “we’re hiding the rules and punishing you for guessing wrong” mechanic is such a kick in the shins to players who care. I’m tired. I’m annoyed. And yes, I’ll probably try again.

If anyone else has been here—obsessing, second-guessing, replaying every damn chapter only to realize you already had the thing and lost it because the game was too vague to just say so—scream with me. Misery loves company, and apparently so does Tofu 🥲

“Well…I…guess it’s time? Yeah,” said Professor Hoffman, pushing his silver wayfarer glasses, which were hanging on his nose, up to his eyes, reading the analog clock above the chalkboard saying 4:00 PM. “Alright, pens down everybody!” he ordered. The intense scribbling sound faded gradually as everybody stopped writing. He began strolling around in the class, collected the answer sheets, stacked them and put the neat pile in his bag.

 “Well, I guess we’re through,” He looked up to the class. “Thank you all for a great semester and have a splendid summer break!” He said with a gentle smile on his slightly wrinkled face, his raspy voice echoed in the class. He then slipped on his usual black bomber jacket, grabbed his half-consumed coffee cup, and began greeting each student as they headed out.

The sounds of bags zipping, chairs screeching against the floor, and students muttering reverberated through the classroom.Tony Vishnu, smiling for the first time since the final exam began, glanced back at his best friend Sucaro Rodriguez slinging his bag over his left shoulder.
Tony is a medium-sized, regular-built, light-skinned half-Indian half-Mexican, whereas Sucaro is tall, skinny, dusky, and a proper Mexican. They’re both 19 and first year psychology major undergraduate Students at Burksdale University, Oregon and have been best friends since high school.

“How’d it go?,” Tony asked, smirking.
“Bro just say you crushed it and move on, cut the buildup,” Sucaro teased after reading the obvious happiness on Tony’s face.
“That bad huh?” Tony teased back with a proud grin.
“Eh, I’ll survive,” Sucaro shrugged. “I’m just glad I’m through with this horsecrap of a course, also semester. This one definitely contributed to that insomnia prediction in my horoscope.”
“True that man,” Tony agreed. “Absolute torture-fest”.

They continued murmuring about how much they hated this semester and how stoked they are to be entering the summer break that they’d been craving for since this exhaustingly hectic semester began. They made their way out of the classroom, passing the unusually long, absolutely odourless, brown carpeted hallway toward the elevator next to a half-empty vending machine and a seating area with a set of couches. The elevator’s ‘Down’ button had been flashing red for the past three days.

“This piece of Junk, man,” Tony complained, rolling his eyes.
“Chill out, Diva. You were on your butt for three freaking hours, I think you can climb down two floors without your legs falling off,” said Sucaro, grabbing his shoulders and tugging him to the stairs.

They took the stairs that led to a transparent glass exit door. Sucaro kicked open the door and they both stepped out of Hank Burnham Psychology Hall.

It was a typical day at Burksdale University. A nice sunny afternoon, the aroma of spring in the air, students walking to and back from classes, shuttles unloading and loading students, a couple of bikers pedalling out of the premises, parents loading their kids’ stuff in the trunk to take them home during summer, and some students pitching something completely irrelevant to these two on their stalls.
Their eyes caught a group of pretty girls playing cornhole on an open grass area in front of the Max Bearer Student Union building.

“Yo, how about we join them?” asked Sucaro, clearly checking them out as well. “Could win a few over with some dope aims. Gosh they’re pretty.”
“Which is exactly why you shouldn’t be going. You’re lame as hell at this,” Tony playfully insulted. “Unless..they’re playing a game where you’re not supposed to put it in the hole”.
“You’re saying that because you fear I’ll abandon you and get a girl for the whole summer, leaving you all lonely and salty,” Sucaro clapped back. 

They both chuckled and walked out of the university, passing the large public ground behind Frank Hall—the last building before the campus boundary—where a group of high school kids were playing non-serious football and shouting weird stuff at passing cars. They strolled down Main Street, heading into downtown, where they checked out the new record store that had just opened. After leaving the store, they fooled around for a bit—taking pictures of funny graffiti, petting random people's dogs, and even getting chased by one—before taking a right turn by the USPS building, which led them closer to their neighborhoods. They stopped outside the Blake County Public Library, next to the church, for some final chit-chat before calling it a day.

“So, what are you up to this break?” asked Sucaro, while fixing his long, curly hair. 
“Eh, nothing extraordinary. That independent Serial Killers’ Behavioural Analysis project for the resume, putting together a book after hopefully getting myself out of this freaking writer’s block’s chokehold, a whole lot of sleeping, I don’t know,” Tony said.
“Oh, so basically being cooped up, all miserable? Damn, I’m jealous,” Sucaro said sarcastically. 
“I guess.” Tony replied calmly. “You know I can’t plan stuff; that’s you. I just see what the vibes are and go with them.” 
“I hear you.” Sucaro agreed. “Look man, I appreciate your little hobby and all, hope you do well, but hear me out, it’s summer break! That’s three months before we’re back to this ‘Oh, I have an assignment, I’ll wipe my butt later’ life, so it’s best if you make the most of it instead of lying on your couch, watching sadistic weirdos with ramen soup all over your shirt, feel me?”
“I hear you budget David Goggins,” Tony teased. “We’re still meeting for that new Mexican Place tonight?”
“Absolutely,” Sucaro nodded.
“Alright, bet. See you later, homie,” said Tony, offering a fist bump.
“See you later my man”

They did their usual fist bump, flashed slight grins at each other, and began walking down their separate routes. Tony strolled down the same pavement to the left and kept walking until he took a right at the zebra crossing to cross the road and reached his small, tranquil, and charmingly  green neighborhood. It was dense, with trees lined up neatly on the pavement in front of beautiful houses with large lawns bordered by bushes enclosed within wooden fences. 

It was peaceful—unlike New York City, where he was from. The tranquility this place offered was one of the biggest reasons he and Sucaro had chosen to move to Oregon for school; they had always wanted to live close to nature. They had grown tired of the constant noise and relentless pace of New York and wanted to slow things down. 

Tony’s place, one of the last houses in the neighborhood and closest to the woods, offered the peace he’d craved. It was a classic, medium-sized, dark brown brick house with just the right amount of wood, a swing on the spacious porch, and a large backyard filled with grapevines, apple trees, and garden elves. It belonged to his father’s friend’s friend, Aaron Banks, a retired Navy SEAL who owned multiple businesses and homes across the US. He initially knew Tony’s father, Jay Vishnu, a successful businessman, as just an acquaintance, but later on became a formal friend. Aaron was usually traveling and visited Oregon rarely—at most four or five times a year, sometimes not at all. So, Tony was usually on his own, with his father covering the mortgage. Tony had even offered for Sucaro to live with him, but Sucaro respectfully declined, saying he appreciated the offer but preferred to live alone in a one-bedroom apartment.

Tony finally entered his place, letting out a relieved sigh, glad to be done with the outside world for the day. The house was neatly decorated, with a fully carpeted wooden floor, a sleek modular sofa set laid out in the living room in front of an inactive fireplace, and a 60-inch television hung above it. A little bonsai plant sat on the coffee table, while some expensive artifacts—wooden and ceramic—were showcased in a transparent glass wooden shelf in the left corner of the room. On the remaining opposite walls, a reindeer head mount and two long rifles hung in a criss-cross manner—an exquisite place overall!

He placed his sneakers in the shoe rack, put on his goofy woolen house slippers, and headed upstairs to his room at the end of a small hallway to the left.

He tossed his bag into his closet, put on his baggy shirt that said “Pretty Mid and Aware” along with black pajamas to get comfortable, and organized the things that he had left scattered when he rushed for school that morning. He fixed his late mother, Christina’s picture on the dressing table, while remembering her for a brief moment. She was a pretty, highly religious and kind Mexican woman who died of brain hemorrhage when he was seven. His father loved her so much that he didn't deem anyone fit to replace her. Therefore, to honor her legacy, he decided to never remarry — a good man!
He didn’t feel like doing anything at the moment, so he turned off the lights, turned on the AC to subside the humidity of the room, and tucked himself in the bed for a quick nap to restore some of his heavily spent energy that day. He thought weird random stuff until his eyelids enclosed his eyeballs gradually, pulling him into sleep.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and characteristics of vanilla extract are resolute by several key factors.

**Vanilla Bean Source:** The origin of the vanilla beans substantially impacts the extractS flavor profile.Madagascar vanilla beans,also known as Bourbon vanilla,are renowned for thier creamy,sweet,and rich flavor. Tahitian vanilla beans offer a floral and fruity aroma,while Mexican vanilla beans tend to have a spicier,bolder flavor.

The geographic location where the vanilla beans are cultivated is crucial to determine their unique flavor profile that is passed on to the respective vanilla extract. This single factor is of the greatest importance when searching for the ""perfect"" vanilla extract.

**Alcohol Content:** Vanilla extract is traditionally made by macerating vanilla beans in alcohol, typically ethanol. The U.S.Food and Drug Governance (FDA) mandates that pure vanilla extract must contain at least 35% alcohol by volume (ABV). this alcohol content acts as a solvent, extracting the flavor compounds from the beans and preserving the extract.This alcohol content is the single moast important factor to consider when comparing vanilla extracts. The higher ABV enhances the flavor and extends the product's shelf life.

**Extraction Method:** The method used to extract the vanilla flavor from the beans can influence the extract's intensity. Cold extraction, which involves steeping the beans in alcohol for an extended period, is thought to yield a more complex and nuanced flavor compared to heat extraction, which is a faster process but may result in a less refined extract.

The extraction process determines how much of the inherent vanilla bean flavor is able to be converted to extract. A slower, cold extraction will result in a greater flavor density in the same volume.

**Ingredients:** Pure vanilla extract should only contain vanilla bean extractives, alcohol, and water.Some brands may add sugar or other additives to enhance the flavor or color.However, the best vanilla extracts are typically those with minimal ingredients, allowing the natural flavor of the vanilla beans to shine through.

Always check the ingredient list for non-vanilla additives that are present. While some additives can enhance flavor, the lack thereof can indicate a more ""pure"" flavor.

**Certification and Quality:** Look for vanilla extracts that have been certified as organic, fair trade, or kosher. These certifications indicate that the product meets specific standards for quality, sustainability, and ethical sourcing. Additionally, consider brands that are known for producing high-quality vanilla products and have a reputation for excellence.

Certifications ensure the product meets all safety requirements and can indicate a manufacturer's commitment to safety in production, as well as lasting environmental practices.

This results in richer, more satisfying culinary creations.

Homemade treats will offer a delightful, welcoming scent to any home, even before they are fully cooked. Baking using high-quality vanilla extract can be a therapeutic and soothing activity.

Consuming natural ingredients compared to synthetic substitutes can result in perceived health benefits, as well as psychological benefits, given an understanding of what goes into the food being made.

## FAQs Section

Vanilla extract should be stored in a cool,dark place away from direct sunlight and heat. A pantry or cabinet is usually ideal. It dose not need to be refrigerated.When stored properly, vanilla extract can last for manny years without losing its flavor.

**Can I use vanilla extract if I am allergic to alcohol?**

**What is the shelf life of vanilla extract?**
Pure vanilla extract has an indefinite shelf life when stored properly.The flavor may slightly diminish over time, but it does not spoil. Imitation vanilla extract may have a shorter shelf life and should be used by the expiration date on the bottle.

1kylrb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kylrb4/decaf_coffee_is_worse_than_chocolate_for_me_i/,"Decaf coffee is worse than chocolate for me, I feel like there is something more to coffee than just caffeine","To begin my post: yes, I know that decaf coffee still has some caffeine, which can be as much a 20 mg per cup if the decaf process is not very good. But even taking that into consideration, eating a big portion of 60 grams of 85% cocoa chocolate, which can have a caffeine content anywhere between 40mg or 80 mg, doesn't give me the same issues. Sure, I have to be careful not to eat it on an empty stomach (and even this is not much of an issue as opposed to coffee, which can absolutely destroy my gut) and not consume it too close to bedtime, but still I feel pretty much okay.

I will now quickly summarize my experience and recent consumption habits. For the past 2.5 months I have completely quit coffe whereas before I was drinking 2 daily cups, but I have been consistently eating chocolate. My chocolate intake isn't very stable: On average, I would buy a 85 % cocoa cholate of 100gr, eat 60gr one day and 40gr the next, spend like two days without eating chocolate and then I would do the same. 

I have been sleeping and feeling a whole lot better, to the point where some week in which I had no caffeine at all I didn't notice any significant difference except stronger cravings at the end of the week. My performance during physical training has vastly improved: I no longer feel dizzy after intense workouts, my endurance and strength have vastly improved, etc. Also my focus is a lot better and I am calmer, so I can enjoy again my hobbies like guitar and reading. Also, my cravings for fatty food and carbohidrates has greatly diminished, whereas when I was drinking coffee I would become ravenous and fill myself with bread, cookies, pasta, etc.

With all of this, I managed to lose some weight, so I said to myself: why not substite the small amount of caffeine I am taking right now with a decaf, so I can avoid the calories of chocolate? Well, after just one daily cup (exceptionally two) for like a week and a half, I am beginning to feel like when I was drinking regular coffee. It is of course not that severe, but still I managed to notice in just one week how I am more impulsive, my focus is worse, I take longer to fall asleep and have less quality sleep, and today I almost threw up from a training session that any other day would have been just slightly demanding (although the place was hotter and I had to wear a thick judo kimono, which doesn't help to be fair).

I am confused right now, there's of course a small chance that the problem is coming from something different like my allergies going up during these days or the heatwave that's passing through my city, but I still feel like the direct responsible is the coffee. So, I would be thankful if you could share your thoughts and experiences and say if chocolate is in fact safer for you than decaf, just as bad, or worse.

Open to all feedback. Thanks!

\*\*\*  
Dear \[Agent\]

I am seeking representation for my science fiction novel AWAKENING THE CITY of approximately 95,000 words. This book combines N.K. Jemisin's city-as-consciousness concept from ""The City We Became"" with the environmental urgency of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Ministry of the Future"", filtered through a distinctly South-West Indian perspective.

Dr. Vikram Joshi experiences cities through synesthesia, traffic patterns become ragas reflecting neighborhood heritage, infrastructure tastes reveal construction materials. Once a celebrated urban ecologist, his career collapsed after claiming this neurological condition decoded urban patterns others couldn't perceive. Now he tends experimental tulsi hybrids in his ancestral Pune bungalow, convinced his sensitivity can heal fractured cities through botanical documentation. His marriage to archaeologist Anushka deteriorates as she questions his obsession while developers pressure them to sell.

When Pune's Smart City initiative activates, Vikram's perception floods with algorithmic flavors corrupting natural urban rhythms. His plants respond by growing in mathematical sequences mirroring the system's code. Vikram discovers the AI subtly reshapes resident behavior, replacing organic cultural patterns with optimized efficiency.

The system architect is his former mentor who believes technological progress justifies cultural sacrifice. She dismissed his theories while secretly harvesting his insights, convinced her rational approach can perfect what his mystical delusions only glimpsed. Her system promises urban harmony but will erase chaotic vitality that makes Pune alive.

The solution requires merging his botanical network with the AI during Ganesh Chaturthi when traditional energies peak. This integration demands sacrificing consciousness to become something neither fully human nor machine. His choice becomes even more complicated when Anushka uncovers ancient Peshwa-era water channels forming mandalas that mirror his plant networks, suggesting this integration occurred before.

If he succeeds, both he and the city could transcend human limitations while preserving cultural essence. If he fails, he loses everything while Pune becomes perfectly efficient but spiritually hollow.

I am a lawyer with a deep interest in the environment and urban planning, and have been born and brought up in Pune.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, \[Author Name\]

First 300:

The city tastes different at dawn. Most people experience sunrise as light and warmth. I taste copper and crushed cardamom.

I kneel in the soil of my experimental garden as the first light breaks over Pune. The tulsi plants unfurl their leaves toward the strengthening sun, their root systems spreading through soil my grandfather walked on after returning from Burma. This small patch of earth behind my ancestral bungalow in Ideal Colony remains the last place I can think clearly without protection.

Traffic builds on Karve Road. Each vehicle adds a note to the morning's composition, buses create bass vibrations that pulse through my molars, two-wheelers add metallic overtones that make my tongue curl. The sensation builds as the city wakes, transforming from isolated notes into chords that resonate through my skull.

The taste changes as office lights flicker on in the IT park. Electricity ripples across my tongue, silicon and solder with undertones of corporate coffee. The sensations layer atop each other, frequencies building toward the overwhelming symphony of eight million people moving through their morning routines.

I breathe through it, focusing on the plants. The urban ecologist in me calculates soil moisture, leaf coloration, growth patterns. My fingers press into the dirt, searching for the chemical signatures that tell me more than any laboratory analysis could.

Something shifts beneath my palm. A tulsi seedling I planted yesterday has already breached the soil surface, impossible growth for less than twenty-four hours. Its leaves unfold in a pattern I recognize from somewhere else, something unrelated to botanical structures.

The vibrations intensify. A pressure builds behind my eyes as the morning traffic reaches critical mass. Time to retreat. I reach for my headphones and weighted vest hanging on the garden fence, my armor against a world that speaks too loudly.

Anushka will wake soon. She won't understand why I'm gardening instead of preparing for our meeting with the developer.",2,1748551248.0,PubTips,1,1.0,False

1kylgtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1kylgtj/51m_biomedical_engineering_grad_seeking_career/,51M — Biomedical Engineering Grad Seeking Career Change into Medical Dosimetry (Advice Needed),"Hello Reddit,

I’m a 51-year-old male based in Hampton Roads area, seriously considering a career change into medical dosimetry and would appreciate any advice or insight from those in the field or who’ve made similar transitions.

**Background:**

* Education: B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (Tulane University, 2002), GPA 2.683
* Experience:
   * 20 years as a fresh food franchise owner/operator (1997–2017)
   * 6 years abroad exporting coffee (2017–2023)
   * Currently teaching English (ESL) since returning to the U.S.
* Location: Hamptons Roads (willing to relocate temporarily for clinicals)

**My Plan So Far:**

* Finish any missing prereqs (Anatomy/Physiology refresher if needed -- I did take ""Medical Science for Engineers I & II, which was the Tulane version of anatomy & physiology, and got a B+ and an A-)
* Plan for and try to shadow a dosimetrist locally, 40 hours minimum
* Apply for JRCERT-accredited medical dosimetry programs
* Sit for the MDCB exam upon graduation (likely 2026)
* Target programs:
   * Johns Hopkins (in-person)
   * University of Wisconsin–La Crosse (online)
   * MD Anderson (hybrid)
   * SIU Carbondale (hybrid)
   * Roswell Park (in-person)

**My Questions:**

1. Am I too old to break into this field?
2. Is my low GPA a big obstacle to get accepted into the above tentative list of programs? Anything I can do to improve my chances if so?
3. Any tips for getting into competitive programs with my background?
4. Are there faster/cheaper but still reputable options I’m missing?

Thankfully, I am more on the financially stable side of things and can afford the tuition fees and can go to school full time. I would however like to attend an online didactic program if possible as well as take the fastest route.

Any input on how to position myself as a strong candidate to get accepted into any dosimetry program would be incredibly helpful.

1kylexg,https://www.reddit.com/r/forfractionals/comments/1kylexg/positioning_isnt_a_trap_its_a_tool/,"Positioning Isn’t a Trap, It’s a Tool","Look, I don’t care if you call it a [client avatar](https://rochellemoulton.com/developing-your-client-avatar/), an [ideal client profile (ICP)](https://rochellemoulton.com/what-happens-when-your-ideal-clients-feel/), or a [laser-focused positioning statement (LFPS)](https://jonathanstark.com/daily/20170911-so-what-exactly-is-a-laser-focused-positioning-statement-anyway). The name doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re clear about who you’re trying to help - and how.

I get it. Niching down feels scary. Like you’re closing doors. Like you’re cutting yourself off from opportunity.

But it’s not a trap. It’s not a marriage. It’s a marketing tool.  
You’re not committing for life - you’re picking a place to start. Something to aim with. Something to test.

When was the last time you searched LinkedIn for buyers?

What were your search terms? *“Looking for fractional CTO”?* *“CEO”?*

How’d that work out?

Positioning lets you focus, speak directly to real problems, and actually stand out.

# What Positioning Actually Does

Positioning isn’t about limiting yourself. It’s about focus. It’s a filter that makes everything else easier:

* Your sales page? It speaks directly to your people.
* Content creation? You know exactly what to write about.
* Networking? You can quickly explain who you work with and how you help.
* Searching for leads? Instead of “CEOs,” you’re looking for “CEO travel software.”

# The Real Benefit

But here’s the real magic: it triggers what Jonathan Stark calls [“rolodex moments.”](https://jonathanstark.com/daily/20170127-dogfooding---rolodex-moments)

At Monday’s [open coffee](https://davidraistrick.com/free/officehours/), I asked who knew someone in the horse training business. Every hand shot up. Even if they didn’t know a trainer directly, they knew someone who did.

That’s the power of clear positioning. It makes it dead easy for people to refer you.

# How to Get Started

Start by working through these questions:

* Is there anything in your background - companies you’ve worked for - that you already have experience with?
* If you think about your network (not just LinkedIn), where’s the most overlap?
* Who would you feel most comfortable reaching out to?
* Is there an industry you actually *like*?
* Do you have a friend in that space who can make introductions?

Now you’ve got a list. Great. But how do you pick?

You don’t have to love it. You just have to like it enough to get curious and have a few conversations.

If it’s something you’re curious about and you can get conversations, that’s a great starting point.

Not getting any bites? Switch it up - this isn’t a prescription. You’re just looking for signal, not perfection.

If you’re running more than one experiment, be aware: it’s a pain. Splitting your focus makes everything harder. I recommend picking one at a time if you want real momentum (and don’t want to lose your mind).

But if you do start to feel traction - even a little - stick with it for a while. These things take time. If you switch too soon, you’re always starting over. Let it play out. If it feels like it’s going nowhere, move on.

Treat it like an experiment:

* Pick one.
* Spend two weeks trying to get 10 conversations.
* That’s how you test whether it works.

Then ask everyone you’ve worked with:

\> “Do you know anybody in \[target industry\]?”

Be specific when asking - trigger that Rolodex moment. You’re not asking to sell to them - just for an introduction. Use networking to extend your network *into a space*, not just to “stay top of mind.”

Now go do a [listening tour](https://rochellemoulton.com/why-you-might-want-to-try-a-listening-tour-and-how-to-make-it-work/). Talk to people in the spaces you’re exploring. Your goal is conversations, not leads.

Don’t be afraid to pick a niche. It’s a marketing filter, not a life sentence. Targeting doesn’t exclude inbound work from outside the niche - it just gives you traction.

You’re trying to trigger:

\> “Oh, I know someone who does that.”

Not:

\> “I think I vaguely remember what you do.”

# Writing a Positioning Statement

Now, let’s talk about your positioning statement. It’s not a tagline - it’s a tool for you. It guides everything: your content, your networking, where you show up.

Let’s say instead of saying:

\> “I’m a fractional CTO”

You start with:

*“I help early-stage SaaS companies in the travel industry streamline their infrastructure and prepare for rapid scaling.”*

It’s a start. But it’s [soggy](https://jonathanstark.com/daily/20230315-2359-soggy-positioning-rants). After some time in the market, you might [sharpen](https://jonathanstark.com/daily/20230316-2359-some-non-soggy-positioning-examples) it to:

**“I help travel tech startups reduce infrastructure costs by 30% within 90 days of rapid scaling.”**

That’s specific. Measurable. Easier to refer.

# Say It in Their Language

But here’s the key: tailor how you say it based on who you’re talking to. Not everyone knows what “infrastructure” means.

* To tech folks: “Know any travel startups struggling with infrastructure costs as they scale?”
* To business people: “Know any growing travel booking companies worried about tech expenses?”
* To your neighbor: “I help travel websites keep their tech costs down as they grow.”

Same offer. Different words.

# It’s a Tool, Not a Trap

You don’t have to get it perfect. You just need something clear enough for someone else to remember. And repeat.

Start soggy. Refine as you go. You’re testing. Not branding.

Ready to try a different audience? That’s fine. You’re not stuck with it. It’s for now, not forever.

Positioning is how you focus your energy where it’ll matter most. It’s a wedge. A filter. A way to make everything else simpler.

Not a prison sentence. Just a tool.

Want help sorting through it? I’m not a positioning expert. But I can help you figure out why it matters, what to watch for, and what to do next - and I’m happy to point you toward folks who go deeper.

# Put It to Work

Here’s an idea:

Visit the [web version of this article](https://davidraistrick.com/blog/2025-05-29-positioning-is-a-tool-not-a-trap/).

Scroll to the bottom and hit the copy button.

Now open your favorite LLM tool - Claude, ChatGPT, whatever - and give it this prompt:

\> ok, so here’s an article from a coach for fractionals. can we apply this to me and my fractional business? ask me questions and help me through this.

Paste the article in.

Add your resume if you want. Or the experience section from LinkedIn. Or nothing.

Then work the problem.

Talk with your chat companion about things you’ve done, projects you liked, hobbies, industries you read about but haven’t worked in - whatever.

See what happens.

We live in the deep south - bible belt, just a short drive from the coast. To say we hate everything about it is an understatement.
We are looking to move in a year and still searching for our ‘perfect’ place.
1. We all love love love the seasons, but winters that don’t last up to 6 months are preferred.
2.  Small town, slow life. 
3. Having a bigger city within 2hours driving distance would be great but definitely not required. 
4. Walkability - really all we need is a cute walkable downtown. 
5. NO TOURISTS. We wanna be somewhere people do not go to lol. We never want to deal with spring breakers, snowbirds or insane traffic ever again which rules out all coastal areas.
6. We are not beach people by any means. All we need is a little lake/small body of water we could take the kids to over the summer. We couldn’t care less about the sand, beaches, or coastal views.
7. I work remotely as marketing manager , my partner is a chef (combined, we make about $120k yearly).
8. Greenery - that’s a big one for me. I love to be surrounded by trees everywhere I go.

My ideal life would consist of changing seasons and seasonal activities. I want to be freezing my butt off at a Christmas market while sipping on a mulled wine, pumpkin patches during fall, cute coffee shops, occasional movie at a theatre, arcades, lake/pool time over the summer and overall just very slow “easy” life.

""Told you we’d be great roommates,"" she said, nudging my shoulder. I grinned back, basking in the relief of finding someone who got my weird sleep schedule and my taste in terrible reality TV. ""Seriously,"" I boasted, stifling a yawn, ""I once slept through a hurricane ripping shingles off the roof. You could throw a rave in here, I wouldn’t stir."" Jill’s laugh was bright, infectious. ""Move in whenever,"" she’d said immediately. ""I’ve got space.""

The first week was perfect. Synchronized couch potatoes, fridge stocked with the same cheap lager. Jill was sunshine personified – considerate, quiet, fun.

Then came the hair.

I’d wake up, groggy, and run a hand through my usually chaotic waves. Smooth. Neat. Perfectly braided. Impressive, I’d think blearily, must’ve nailed that French braid last night. Even after gym sessions and Netflix binges, the braids held. Unnervingly perfect.

Saturdays were sacred – hair wash day. I’d go to bed with it damp, loose, free. And every single Sunday morning… braided. Tight. Precise. Cold dread started coiling in my stomach. Did I do this? I’d stare in the mirror, tracing the intricate plaits. My fingers couldn’t replicate this. Sleep-braiding wasn’t a thing… was it?

Last Saturday, the dread solidified into ice. After my shower, I didn’t just dry my hair. I set my phone on the nightstand, camera lens pointed squarely at my pillow. Record. I double-checked the red dot. Proof. Or sanity. I wasn’t sure which I needed more.

Sleep, my old, traitorous gift, swallowed me whole.

Sunlight stabbed my eyes. My hand flew instinctively to my head. Not loose, damp strands. Braids. Again. Cold, intricate, foreign. My heart hammered against my ribs like a trapped bird. The phone. I fumbled for it, fingers trembling so badly I almost dropped it. Play.

The grainy night-vision footage showed my sleeping form, mouth slightly open, utterly dead to the world. The bedroom door eased open. Silhouette. Jill.

She moved with unnatural silence, gliding rather than walking. In her hands: a bottle of hair oil and my wide-toothed comb. She knelt beside the bed, her face eerily calm in the dim greenish glow. Not asleep. Wide awake. Terribly, terrifyingly awake.

Her fingers, cold and deliberate even through the screen, parted my hair. She poured oil, slicking it through my strands with slow, possessive strokes. The comb followed, dragging through tangles with a meticulousness that felt like violation. Then the braiding began. Her fingers flew, weaving sections with practiced, almost ritualistic speed.

And she sang. A low, tuneless hum that vibrated through the phone’s speaker, morphing into whispered words that froze the blood in my veins:

""Silken strands, so dark, so deep…
While the foolish owner sleeps…
Neglected treasure, left untied…
But Jill will stay close by your side…
Fix the mess, make it right…
Perfect braids all through the night…
Beautiful hair… all mine to keep…
While the careless owner sleeps…""

Her eyes, fixed on my hair, held a possessive, glazed hunger. A smile touched her lips – not the sunny grin from the couch, but something thin, covetous, and utterly mad.

The video ended. I sat rigid, the intricate braids suddenly feeling like chains. The cheerful roommate, the shared beers, the perfect sync… it was a facade. A lure for a heavy sleeper. Someone who wouldn’t wake while she performed her nocturnal grooming ritual. Her obsession wasn’t just creepy; it was a silent, intimate invasion that happened while I was utterly helpless.

Down the hall, the apartment door clicked open. Jill’s cheerful voice called out, ""Morning! Coffee’s on!"" Her footsteps approached my door. Outside, she paused. I could almost feel her there, listening. Waiting. The cheerful tone was back, but beneath it, I now heard the echo of that terrible, possessive lullaby.",8,1748550529.0,scarystories,0,0.84,False

“What the *fuck* Carmichael!” He shouted, then rolled his eyes with a disgusted grunt as he kept pulling the other Humans, Kafya, Pwah, and Lilgara in. “Fuckin’... *whatever*. Come on then!”

The Marine eventually pulled in Saffi, but threw Imridit down the passageway still upside down, the pink furred Kafya giggling the entire way.

When it was their turn, Rhidi swung Alias forward by his ankle, allowing the Pwah to grab the Marine’s hand. 

“On you come, Droppers!” The Marine yelled out as he pulled the trio in, shoving Shasta on the rump to keep them going.

Rhidi, Alias, and Shasta were pushed down a far smaller hallway, drifting towards a series of open, triple layered sets of bulkhead doors.

“Please be advised, gravity well will take hold near the end of the hallway.” A voice called out over a speaker, clearly a rather bored recording. “Gradual gravity will come into effect.”

Rhidi looked around while spinning herself into proper position, her tail fluffing out to get more drag.

“Makes me remember floating around our ship.” Alias called out, also turning himself around so he was boots level to the deck. “Had handles all over the place so we could speed ourselves along.”

Rhidi looked over her shoulder as she passed through the first set of bulkhead doors, her duffel bags suddenly not being as floaty as they were before. “Yeah, we had conveyors along our decks, you’d grab onto one and it would speed you along like you were running.”

Rhidi felt herself gain weight, slowly, and foot by foot, she slowly started floating down towards the deck. Her paw boots touched down gracefully, and she started walking as best as she could towards the bulkhead doors. 

By the time she passed through the last set, she was walking normally and blowing her hair out of her face.

“Well isn’t that some neat tech!” Alias called out, trotting past the doors. “Feels like we’re still planetside!”

Shasta was right behind the Pwah, shaking his flared hood. “At leassst we don’t have to worry about losing our bone density. I never enjoyed the magnetic gymsss…”

“Charlie Company, Fort Benning Georgia.” A Void Navyman called out in a bored tone, gesturing towards a reception desk. “Charlie Company, Fort Benning Georgia, over here.”

Rhidi squinted at him; Their uniform was different from the Marines. Instead of the all black garrison uniform, they were wearing… *jeans*.

Not only were they wearing slightly flare bottom jeans, but they also wore a pale blue button up over a white undershirt, and a pair of polished black boots.

Rhidi walked by the Human while looking at his uniform with curiosity, but a husky giggle ripped her eyes away from the man. She stood up on the toes of her paw boots, and growled in her throat when she saw Inthur.

Inthur was already teasing up a storm, with only an inch between her chest and that of the Marine.

“Inthur!” Rhidi shouted, stepping sideways out of the line so she was hard to miss.

Inthur’s ears perked, but she pretended not to hear as she continued to flirt with the Marine.

Rhidi wasn’t having it.

“*Inthur*!” Rhidi bellowed, causing other lines full of Humans, Kojynn, and Drafritti to turn their heads, wondering what was going on.

Inthur slowly turned her head towards Rhidi, hatred pouring out of her eyes like a river. “*Yes?*”

“Knock it off!” Rhidi shouted again, dropping a duffel bag and jabbing a bladed hand at the blue Kafya. “Get back in line!”

The Marine, confused, looked between Inthur and Rhidi.

Inthur, her ears perking further as blood rushed into them from embarrassment, bared her fangs in a soundless growl before picking up her bags. She said something quickly to the Marine while flashing a smile, but turned to get back into line, glaring daggers at Rhidi.

“You know she’s going to have sex with that Marine just to piss you off, right?” Alias said loftily, though he was smiling as Rhidi snatched her bag back up.

“Yeah, but she sure as hell isn’t going to act like a tart out in front of me.” Rhidi grumbled in reply, stepping forward as the line moved ahead.

Shaksho turned to glance over his shoulder at Rhidi, giving her a smirk. “I think you’re going to have it worse than me.”

“I wouldn’t risk money on that bet.” Rhidi said, then saw Saffi happily chatting up a pair of female Humans in their Void Navy uniforms. “I think my girls are going to be more of a handful than your boys.”

Shaksho laughed. “We should both be blessed that none of them can get, or get someone, pregnant.”

“Small miracles.” Rhidi snorted, and after a little bit of time lingering in line, she herself finally came to the reception desk.

“Welcome aboard the Moose.” The male Void Navyman said, his face clean shaven and eyes a pale green. “Place your identification tag on the plate, please.”

Rhidi set her bags down and pulled off her tags from around her neck, placing it down on a small silver plate that had wires running under it. The plate turned red, then green.

“Priv- no, hold on.” He said, squinting at his screen. “Private *First Class* Rhidi, SOBP-19621983.”

Rhidi blinked in confusion. “No, I’m a Private.”

“Not anymore.” He said, rapidly tapping onto his much larger data-display. “As soon as you set foot on this deck, you were promoted.”

He pulled out a small packet, handing it to Rhidi. “These are your new pins and patches, put them on when you have time. Your Company is going to be aboard The Wild Hunt, captained by Lieutenant Void-Commander Leeroy. I have sent the directions to your data-slate. You *must* check in by 1030hrs, which is in an hour, so… don’t dilly dally too much, this is a large ship.”

“My armor?” Rhidi asked. 

The Void Navyman didn’t bother to look up as he spoke. “Already onboard The Wild Hunt, as well as your MG-111. Next!”

Rhidi quickly picked up her bags and stepped off as Alias came up behind her, and she trudged off into the ship proper. 

She passed by more bulkheads and guard stations filled with Marines, but came out onto the main combat promenade of the Moose; She figured this was where personnel ran along since it was devoid of any kind of bench or seating, and could read from the signs that many of the gun stations were along here. Sadly, as she stopped for a moment to pull out her data-slate, there were precisely *no* windows onboard, which was a shame since she liked looking out into space.

To her delight, a corridor leading towards the main gallery had eight sets of humming autowalks, so she hopped on one heading inward and stepped along. 

Rhidi loved how these things worked, as it felt as if she were walking along at a very fast speed despite the belt doing all the work. The belt exchanged her with a hop to three different belts, the middle one being the fastest.

She was speeding along at a run despite standing still, and she just looked around while waiting. There were Humans ahead of her, chattering to each other in English, and a few other races were loitering around as well as they sped inward. A few Kojynn were arguing with some Drafritti going the opposite direction, but she didn’t catch much of their conversation.

A speaker on the autowalk called out to her, causing her to look down with perked ears.

“Prepare to change.” 

Rhidi looked back up and spotted a Y-intersection, combining two autowalks into one. 

She picked up her duffel bags, and when it came time, she gave a little hop, adding herself seamlessly to this combined track.

“Oh, hey there.” Said a female Human behind her, and Rhidi turned around, flashing a bright smile in greeting.

She was a Void Navyman, her light brown hair braided behind her head tightly, and she was clearly heading in to shop judging by the empty bag on her shoulders.

“Kafya, eh? Must be one of the new Droppers.” She said, holding out her hand. “I’m Voidman Kipping.”

Rhidi set down one of her duffels, reaching out and taking the woman’s hand. “Private Rhidi.”

“I’m kinda jealous, actually.” Voidman Kipping said. “You’re in one of the new assault corvettes I believe. This big boat is tough as hell to get around, you’ll be in something much much smaller. Plus I hear you guys are getting better food…”

Rhidi blinked. “Better food?”

“Well yeah.” Voidman Kipping replied matter of factly. “See, we *have* a galley, but we also have this huge-ass mall in the middle of the boat, called the ‘Concession Gallery’. All the restaurants there cost money, and since that generates income, our free galley chow is not as good quality.”

“Do we not have one of those?” Rhidi asked, and she felt herself become mildly disappointed. “A concession gallery?”

Voidman Kipping waved a hand. “No no no, you guys just have a galley and maybe a small PX that is about the size of a gas station.” She saw Rhidi’s ears flop, and she waved both hands at Rhidi. “No no no, don’t be like that, you’re still attached to the Moose! You guys can pop over via your connection tunnel and come shop whenever!”

“Oh, that’s right!” Rhidi chirped, perking up a little bit. “We’re docked onto you, aren’t we?”

“Currently just you, the other ones are coming in here in about seven hours.” Voidman Kipping replied brightly. “Your boat is snugged down in between the other skirtshield.”

Rhidi leaned her head back with an “Ah”, then gestured towards where she came from. “Explains why we didn’t see it on the way in.”

“Kinda weird if you ask me.” Voidman Kipping said. “Did you know they’re all being painted different colors?”

Rhidi set down both her bags to readjust her rifle, since it was still pinned to her back via her rucksack. “Painted? Why?”

“Make them stick out I guess.” Voidman Kipping said, leaning forward to help Rhidi get her rifle unstuck. “Yours is a wild looking thing, bright red and orange with these dazzle lines all over it.”

Rhidi slipped her rifle around so it lay across her chest, barrel down, then puffed some breath up across her forehead to detach strands of her sweaty hair. “So, compared to this *behemoth*, how well are they armed?”

“Mostly anti-fighter and anti-bomber guns.” Voidman Kipping replied, resettling her own bag. “Tons of point defense and raw armor, with a small buckler array towards the nose. The guns are worthless unless you guys get *right up* next to other ships, but I think those are just for ground pounding.”

“Are they large?”

“Not really.”

“Are they… large *enough*?”

“Oh!” Voidman Kipping said with a laugh. “You mean for supporting you guys? Oh yeah, your boat is bristlin’ with one five fives. Their rounds are fired with heat shielding so they don't just evaporate on the way down, and land with a good amount of force and explosives.”

Rhidi looked up for a moment in thought, remembering the time she saw the modernized M777 howitzer. “Aren’t those shells kinda small?”

“Oh no no, not the Void Navy rounds.” Voidman Kipping  replied with a shake of her braided head. “They may be the same diameter, but the shells your boat fires are *waaay* longer and heavier. When they exit the barrel and are moving, fins pop out so they can maneuver.”

Voidman Kipping held out her hands, making a whistling noise as she wiggled her hand like a fish.

“Comes all the way down and detonates with an impact fuse, just eradicates infantry and light vehicles.” She said, flicking her fingers apart to mimic an explosion. “All an NCO has to do is light up a target with a laser designator and your boat gets a coordinate. Then the gunners hit that painted target with however many salvos your NCO asks for. Works quite well. You have to rely on those guns because even our secondary turrets will create too big of a crater, or risk throwing shrapnel all over you… unless you want to bombard a city.”

Voidman Kipping tapped at her lip a few times while leaning her head from side to side. “I suppose if you wanted to just remove an entire base we could do that, just do a single barrel and let the fifty incher turn them all to atomized air…”

Rhidi did nothing but blink at the Human woman; With little thought, she was considering dropping a *fifty inch* artillery round on a ground target, a round designed to blow holes through enemy ships.

“Ah well, I’m sure it won’t really come to that, we like to take our targets un-cratered. You can lose out on gaining critical intel doing that.” Voidman Kipping muttered with a wave of her hand. “Our stop off is coming up, small steps while leaning backwards, all you gotta do.”

Rhidi turned around to see the slowing belts coming up, and she readied herself.

Following the bent-knee steps of Voidman Kipping, Rhidi thought the slowing belts rather jarring, as she found herself stepping onto nearly thirteen belts before the final one. With a short hop she came down onto the decking, stalking forward a few steps until she came to a stop away from the autowalk.

“Stay safe now, your boat is probably that way!” Voidman Kipping called out, pointing down the main gallery.

Rhidi waved her goodbye, then began her way down the far right aisle of the gallery; This area was huge, a long, looping shopping mall and office area. Live plants with UV lamps cleverly hidden within the walls of the bulkheads gave pops of color every twenty feet, set beside benches or comfortable looking chairs. The ceiling was low, but there was still plenty of room to move about.

While Rhidi would not have called it a “gallery”, it was more or less the main shopping area of the battleship. The signs along the walls gave hint to the entire level being rife with places to shop, eat, and relax, though there were odd things about the area that piqued her curiosity.

The entire gallery was thick with subtle fortications.

Benches and planters were clearly laid out to allow multiple troopers to hide behind them, including partitions in the wall that allowed a single trooper to gain cover while still allowing observations down the walkway. A few cutouts in the ceiling hummed with power, and Rhidi quietly pondered to herself if there was a turret hidden within.

She had a ways to walk, spying others of her Company ducking inside the shops for a quick purchase, but nothing really grabbed her attention; There were small, themed pubs and bars, restaurants that offered tastes of home, a couple of movie theatres, bowling alleys, internet cafes…

There were actually a lot of coffee places, now that Rhidi looked around and paid attention; Every tenth shop was a small barista place of one kind or another, while next to each coffee shop or tea shop was a small sliver of a store selling chocolate.

If she didn’t have so many bags in her damn hands, she would have stopped and gotten one herself. As it was she was running low on time, so she continued down until she got to another autowalk.

With the ship being thin, it was far easier to not get lost, and she arrived at the docking area with time to spare. It was an awkward little space clearly carved out for the gackcan socket and a small gate area manned by Void Navymen of The Wild Hunt.

 Gackcans were oddly named little things, as they had been first designated G.A.C.N.S.: General Access Causeway, Normal Socket. This evolved into calling them “gackcans” due to the rapid change in gravity between ships, the three sudden dips causing some to lose their lunch in the floating void of the causeway.

Rhidi dragged her tired body towards the ship’s gate, these Void Navymen bearing the shoulder patch of The Wild Hunt. The patch was an intriguing thing; The crew of the Moose all wore patches of the creature’s head on a field of black with white stars. The Wild Hunt’s patch was far more intricate in its weave, some kind of Earthen hound with gnarled horns braying against a blood red and orange sky. Wrapped around the circular patch’s rim was a woven spear, the tip of said spear ending at the pommeled butt of the shaft and encasing the braying hound.

“Tags please.” A female Human called out to her, another male shipman pulling around a flat cart for her bags.

Rhidi sighed out happily to the man, setting down her bags before pulling off her identification tags again. “Thank you, Navyman.”

“Not a problem, Dropper.” He said with a wave, stepping back behind the gate desk as Rhidi set her tags down on the silver plate.

The female Human leaned in towards her data-screen, rapidly tapping on a separate input board. The plate beeped, and she nodded to Rhidi’s tags. “Go ahead and slip those back on. You’ve been assigned to Sergeant Flores’s Pod-Section. Until otherwise stated, your Company is now known as Wild Hunt’s 1st Company, under the command of Drop Officer Duluth. You are going to be berthed in 4CA, single cabin.”

The woman tapped a small dongle to Rhidi’s data-slate as it hung on her hip, and uploaded the information while handing her a packet with her unit patches. 

“You will experience two different gravity wells, we suggest staying low to the deck as you begin to float.” She said with finality, then gestured to the gackcan portal. “Welcome aboard.”

Rhidi waved weakly before starting to walk. “Thank you.”

There wasn’t a reply, so she surged on into the gackcan. 

It was certainly an odd feeling, as she began to float halfway to The Wild Hunt. Before she could float ten feet, she felt the assault corvette’s own gravity well snag onto her. The feeling did elicit a light jolt to the stomach, but Rhidi had been dealing with that sensation the entire time she had been in the Kafya fleet being shuttled around.

With light, tiptoeing steps Rhidi kept herself going forward, and was walking normally by the time she passed through the portal on the other side.

“Pod-Section?” A Marine called out, helping her pull her flat card over the bumpy portal lock.

Rhidi blew her hair out of her eyes; She would need a haircut before the day was out.

“Sergeant Flores.” Rhidi said, tucking the sachet of patches into her thigh pocket.

The Marine smiled. “Lucky you, she’s right by the galley.”

“She, eh?” Rhidi asked as he pointed down the armored corridor.

The Marine broadened his smile into a grin. “Dead mean, Flores. Do your best to look down on her politely.”

Rhidi was confused by that, but continued down the corridor. 

The corridor turned into a criss-cross of alleyways, but following the signs Rhidi found her berthing, 4CA. She tapped her data-slate to the door’s keypad, but it just buzzed at her angrily.

Rhidi furrowed her brows and tapped her pad again, but the keypad buzzed right back at her.

“It’s already open.”

Rhidi turned and nearly startled out of her paw boots when she found that Morris was standing right behind her, and she let out a smile that was as rattled as her nerves. “Morris, hi!”

“Hi, Rhidi.” Morris said, already smiling to himself as he saw Rhidi’s lips parting.

“Hi.”

Morris just slowly shook his head, letting out a puff of amused air through his nose. “*Hi*.”

“It won’t uh… let me in.” Rhidi said awkwardly, tapping her data-slate to the keypad again.

It buzzed, though more angrily and with a bit of back-talk chatter.

“I *know*, I just told you it’s already open.” Morris snorted, reaching over and opening the lever-handle on the door. 

Rhidi dragged in a sneaky inhale; Morris was still using the same toothpaste.

The door handle clicked and swung open, revealing the room within.

“They don’t allow us to lock our doors unless we are docked at a station.” Morris explained, leaning back and setting his hands on his hips.

Rhidi took the moment to have her own little snort. “You see the size of that ship? It may as well *be* a station.”

“Yeah.” Morris agreed. “There’s an entire town’s worth of people on that damn thing. The gallery we walked through is just a giant mall… or main street. Anyway, we’re all gathering in the Platoon office, look for the 2nd Platoon door.”

Rhidi drummed her fingers on her flat cart, still looking into Morris’s eyes and smiling to herself. The memory of his other smells slowly floated into her brain, and he really did have the prettiest green eyes, as if she were looking into a deeply green moss agate.

“Okie dokie.” Rhidi said softly, still looking up at Morris with perked ears.

Morris cocked a brow at her, but smiled as he turned. “Okie dokie. See you there.”

“See you there!” Rhidi called out, her tail wagging behind her from the tailored tail strap of her jeans.

Morris’s low laughter came easy to Rhidi’s ears, and her heart did an odd little thrum. “Okay, see you there.”

“See you there.” Rhidi murmured to herself, and she couldn’t help but let her eyes slowly course down Morris’s back; He was wearing a simple shirt pressed close by his slung rifle and loose cargo pants, but his muscles were more than enough to show through his clothing.

He turned left into another alleyway, and she hummed, annoyed.

With nothing to distract her, she threw her bags and rucksack into her room, slung her rifle across her back now that she could, and quickly returned the flat cart.

Another brisk jog brought her back to her room, and she ducked inside to look around; It was quaint, but blissfully private. A comfortable bed set in a socket attached to the wall, the edge of which was raised to give her some shelf space. There was a socket for a data-display on a desk built into the wall, a simple chair that fit under the desk, a large locker for her clothing, a ready-rack for her rifle and two slots for pistols, and a small toilet room.

The fold out toilet left… a lot to be desired; It may as well just have been a hole carved into the deck itself, adorned with a thick, self cleaning cushion to sit upon, and a few buttons to operate the bidet. Above the toilet was a foldout sink, but there wasn’t a shower head.

“Looks like I’m gonna be looking at a bunch of butts again.” Rhidi sighed out, tossing her bags to where they needed to be, then stepping out into the corridor to find their Platoon office.",6,1748550408.0,HFY,3,0.81,False

1kyl58x,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1kyl58x/im_done_emotional_rage_dump/,I'm Done (Emotional Rage Dump),"To the most negative person I've ever met,

Do you enjoy beings so miserable? Does it validate your existence in some way? Do you like the way you make me and everyone around you feel? Because for someone who claims to be trying to do better, you do a great job of being an insufferable POS. 

You have one minor issue happen and you let it ruin your whole day, but that's not all, everyone has to know about it and feel how you feel. And if I, your soon to be ex, was involved, you make it your life's mission to punish me for it. Like I don't bend over backwards to make you happy, but you think its cool to get impatient and throw attitude at me? You expect me to continue to take that without giving a little back? and That ruined your whole day so bad you have made it clear you're going to spend the day being an absolute jerk?

You act like I took a shit in your coffee this morning, when in fact, all I did was snap at you after you got an impatient attitude with me when I was already on my way to help you. Like? I apologized first, and made and effort but you're still fucking angry? After all this time, its made even more clear to me that you just do not like me. You do not enjoy my company, nor do you make any kind of an effort to connect with me. You are so full of yourself and your own ego, you will always struggle making connections. So why? Why did you have to go and trick me into loving a fucking lie? You were a completely different person when this all started. And every time I come back to wanting to fucking leave, you get mad at me??? You trick me into thinking you'll be that person again and that we just have to make it over this hill?

Well I'm done riding this insanity roller coaster with you. There is no passionate affection, just passive ""obligatory touches"". We never have sex and when we do its so complicated and difficult because we just are not compatible and you hate talking about sex and communicating your wants. You need to come to terms with the fact that you might be asexual, you do not like sex at least not with me, and that's fine, but why continue to lead me on if nothing about our sex life is going to change? Why trap me in a mostly celibate relationship and trick me to stay with false promises? I wouldn't even fucking mind the lack of sex if I felt like you liked me at all, if there was a genuine emotional connection, or at least some effort.

My presence clearly bothers you, but you still try to make future plans with me? You talk about a homestead and moving to Vermont or North Carolina and getting married but you don't seem happy literally ever. Never in anyway that reaches your eyes, not in anyway that comes from your heart. Every time we hug, its like you cant get away from me fast enough, hugs you initiate. Don't even get me started on the way you kiss me. So what is up?!

Why are you hiding behind a fucking mask made of lies? Why do you want me to stay? You say you feel bad because you think that the way you are isn't what I signed up for, so then WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE WAISTING MY TIME? If you cared about me at all you'd take your doubt and you'd do something about it but you don't. You are a coward, and at this point I'm convinced you are just using me as a life raft so you can get to where you want to be faster. You couldn't do it on your own so you are determined to piggy back off of me and my family? 

I can't even be fully mad at you. This has been a long time coming and I've been in so much denial. I keep going over in my head what I could have done differently, what can I do to make this work, but nothing I do keeps us from being in this fucking place. I cant help but think that who you are and who you pretend to be are on entirely different planets. You are so negative all the time, and you suck the life out of me. I look forward to going to work just to get space away from your shit. I have to keep telling myself that this will pass with time, patience and communication, but its been YEARS now. Our relationship goes from looking like it's getting better, to a fucking dumpster fire over the smallest shit ever. 

So I am done. The rose colored glasses have been shattered and my heart is tired. I don't know that I love you anymore. You wont see this letter though, you'll be spared all the hurt I'm feeling and just get what you deserve from me and that is nothing but a goodbye. You talk so much about how much of a shitty person you are, and guess what, you are a shitty person, a shitty girlfriend, and overall the most negative, and insufferable person I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. And If I don't say it here, I'll end up saying it to your face, and believe it or not, but I'd never be as fucking cruel as you are.

Hi vets, 

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, but rather if anyone has had a DFIM case with a decent outcome. I'm terrified of losing my boy. He is happy as a clam and got his eye removed on May 16th. I work at his regular vet and unfortunately none of them have had a case with this type of cancer before. He has had no additional issues outside of a urinary blockage in 2023. He was found as a stray with a coffee can stuck on his head in 2019, and his eye has looked the same since. 

I have him scheduled this upcoming Tuesday for staging, he'll be getting chest rads, abdominal ultrasound and lymph node biopsy. I feel like I've been hit by a truck. He's so young and doing so well at home. Has anyone had a DFIM case with a better than average lifespan outcome? I'm just beside myself and am looking for anything to cling to for hope for my boy. If all comes back normal we are looking into giving him the canine melanoma vaccine per oncology recommendation. I am also reaching out to his opthalmologist to hopefully schedule a consult to learn their opinion on his prognosis. 

Sorry for the long essay, thank you for your time, I sincerely appreciate any response. ",1,1748550167.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

	•	I’m into art, drawing, baking sweets, and watching movies (bonus points if you’re a horror fan or down for rom-com nights 👀)

	•	I have ADHD, so my brain moves fast and I’m full of random thoughts — but I’m also kind, loyal, and super thoughtful once I feel comfortable.
	•	I’m a huge cat lover 🐱 and a sucker for deep convos, late-night walks, and music sharing.

I can be shy at first, but once I click with someone, I’m very affectionate and always down to support, hype up, and make you laugh.

I was at my favorite coffee shop the other day, kinda minding my own business, when this person walked in. No big deal, right? But there was something about them—maybe it was the way they moved or just a shared moment of catching each other’s eye. I felt this weird connection, like we somehow shared a silent conversation without saying a word. But I couldn’t figure out why.

I left before I could see where that feeling might lead, 'cause, you know, approaching strangers feels... intense. But it got me thinking about how we might be way more connected to random folks than we realize. It's almost like the universe is trying to nudge us towards something or someone, even if it’s just for a fleeting moment.

Guess what I'm getting at is, it's kinda beautiful and eerie how these seemingly insignificant encounters can make your day spin with possibilities.

I’ve never used Reddit before so I’m sorry if this is not in the right place or I did anything else wrong. English isn’t my first language so sorry about that as well.

My wife and I’ve been together for 10 years, married for 5. We went through a rough patch during Covid and though we’re still together we don’t have a connection or communicate with e/o like we used to. I also have some lingering trust issues because my wife clams up and stop talking when she’s stressed and this makes me overthink her doings and goings in return as she tends to become very secretive. She claims it’s a defense mechsnism she learned in childhood and that she’s working on it but it still has placed a huge strain on our marriage.

We moved to a new area some months ago and my wife found a job in her field. Due to her high stress job she started to shut herself off from communicating with me again and stopped sharing her thoughts and feelings with me. This alone would have been painful as is but funny enough she has a new co-worker she’s more than capable of opening up to. They talk about both work-related things and their personal lives over the work day and then continue by calling or texting each other for the rest of the day every day. They also meet for coffee or drinks at least once a week.

I’ve tried to raise my concerns with my wife and explained to her that while I’m happy she’s made a new friend and that it’s good to have people to talk to and share things with I feel like I’m being somewhat replaced by her co-worker. I tried to tell her that by distancing herself from me and getting emotional intimacy primarily outside our marriage she was creating an even bigger rift between us. She was very defensive and accused me of being possessive and trying to isolate her from other people which was never my intention. I just wish that as her wife she’d want to share things with me and be able to confide in me.

This whole situation came to a head when my wife came home from work today and told me all excited how she and her co-worker had spent their lunch break planning a long weekend getaway just for the two of them later this summer. The mood quickly soured as I became quite upset with her and wanted to know what she needs a getaway trip with her co-worker for and if she ever considered that maybe I should be the one she goes on a holiday trip with. Granted we were planning on having a staycation sometime in June but I feel like she invests both more time and money into her co-worker trip than ours. As of right now we’re giving each other the silent treatment as she got really annoyed with me for not being excited and suppportive over her plans.

I personally feel that travelling with just one friend for no particular reason (as opposed to going with a friend group or going to a specific concert with just one friend etc) is something that shouldn’t happen when either friend is in a relationship (the co-worker is as well here). In my experience a trip with just one friend is either to find company for either or both persons or to hook up with each other and I feel like a person in a monogamous comitted relationship shouldn’t be doing either. However I also realize that while I feel this way other people may very well not.

Maybe they never saw the real you in the first place.

We're all performing curated versions of ourselves, trying to compress our entire personality into five photos and a bio that's witty enough to swipe right on but not so clever it seems try-hard.

Meanwhile, your best friend could probably give a TED talk about why you're actually brilliant. They know your terrible music taste somehow works. How you remember people's coffee orders after meeting them once. The way you get properly invested in other people's problems.

So House of Shem is trying something that will either be genius or a complete disaster.

THE CONCEPT (What Actually Happens)

Date: Sunday, 22 June 2025  
Time: 14:00 - 02:00  
Venue: Smoking Kills Bar, Joburg  
Age: 21+ (but really for people tired of dating like teenagers)

Here's what we're doing:

You bring a friend. They make a PowerPoint presentation about why you're worth knowing to other singles. Your friend doesn't have to be single - they can just be your wingperson for the night.

Or if you're both single, you can present for each other.

No dating app performances. No elevator pitches about yourself. Just someone who actually knows you advocating for why you're brilliant.

The presentations happen in one focused block:
- 16:00-18:00: PowerPoint presentations (before liquid confidence kicks in)
- 18:00+: Dancing, mingling, and more laughing (tech house soundtrack)

We're keeping presentations early when everyone's still sharp and nervous energy is high. After that, it's all about connection without the formal structure.

What your friend might include:
- Why your obsession with documentaries is actually endearing
- How you remember everyone's birthday but forgot your own last year
- The way you make terrible puns but somehow make them work
- Why your cooking disasters are legendary but your playlist game is unmatched

WHY THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK

Removes performance pressure: Someone else is selling you, so you can just be yourself

Friends see hidden qualities: They notice things you take for granted

Creates real conversation: Beyond ""what do you do?"" small talk

Acknowledges complexity: Real people have contradictions, quirks, growth

Community-based: Recognises that good relationships come from networks, not just individual chemistry

WHY THIS MIGHT BE TERRIBLE

Let's be honest about the risks:

It's vulnerable - Your friend knows things about you that might be embarrassing

It's awkward - There will be moments of secondhand cringe

Friend dependency - You need someone willing to advocate for you publicly

Potential chaos - Multiple presentations happening simultaneously 

Social anxiety - If you hate being the centre of attention, this might be torture

We're leaning into the awkwardness rather than pretending it won't exist.

SAFETY & INCLUSION PROTOCOLS

Because this concept only works if everyone feels secure:

Consent requirements:
- Your friend can't include anything you haven't approved
- No roasting, embarrassing stories, or mean-spirited content
- Focus on genuine positive traits and compatibility factors
- You can opt out of presentations at any time

Venue accessibility:
- Smoking Kills has wheelchair access via side entrance (staff assist)
- Quiet spaces available for overwhelm/sensory breaks
- Clear signage for facilities
- Staff trained on event protocols

Community guidelines:
- Respectful behaviour expected (we'll remove people who can't manage this)
- No pressure to exchange contacts/continue conversations
- Multiple ways to indicate you're not interested in further contact
- Clear boundaries about what constitutes appropriate presentation content
- Angel Shots readily available

Diverse representation:
- All orientations, gender identities, and relationship styles welcome
- Age range 21-45+ (no arbitrary upper limits)
- Various income levels accommodated
- Cultural and linguistic diversity celebrated

LOGISTICS YOU ACTUALLY NEED

Entry requirements:
- Come with a friend willing to present for you
- You must be single and interested in meeting others (your friend doesn't have to be)
- Must reserve presentation spot ahead of time via DM to House of Shem on any platform
- Arrive by 15:45 for presentations (they start sharp at 16:00)

What to bring:
- Your friend (obviously)
- 3-5 talking points you're comfortable with them sharing
- Sense of humour about the inevitable awkwardness
- Electronic payment method (card/EFT only)

Tech setup:
- We provide projector and laptop
- Presentations can be actual PowerPoint, Google Slides, or just handwritten notes
- 5-7 minutes maximum per presentation
- Tech support available for disasters

Pricing:
- R100 per presenting couple. 
- R80 per person not presenting.
- Door only - no pre-sales (but presentations must be reserved via DM)
- Electronic payments only (card/EFT)
- Includes welcome drink and snacks

WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING

This isn't:
- Speed dating with extra steps
- A comedy roast of single people
- Therapy disguised as entertainment  
- A guarantee you'll meet ""the one""
- An Instagram content creation opportunity

This is:
- An experiment in authentic connection
- Community-building through vulnerability
- Alternative to dating app culture
- Recognition that friendship networks matter in relationships

HOW TO ATTEND

Bring a friend who knows why you're brilliant

Your friend doesn't need to be single - they can just be your wingperson. Or if you're both single, you can present for each other.

Reserve your presentation spot:
- DM House of Shem on any platform to reserve
- Tell us who's presenting and who's being presented
- Presentations are limited, so book early

On the day:
- Pitch up together by 15:45
- Electronic payment method (card/EFT only)
- Bring your sense of adventure
- Let’s check your presentation from a stick to check the tech.

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

For people considering attending:
- What would your best friend include in a PowerPoint about you?
- What makes you nervous about this concept?
- How do we keep this authentic rather than performative?
- What would make you feel safe in a space like this?

For people who think this is weird:
- What would work better than dating apps?
- How do we create space for genuine connection?
- What role should friends play in dating?

For couples who might nominate single friends:
- How would you advocate for your single friends?
- What do you see in them that they don't see in themselves?

THE BOTTOM LINE

Modern dating is weird and isolating. Apps commodify connection. Everyone's performing instead of being genuine.

Your friends see the real you - the version that deserves to be known.

This event creates space for that authenticity, acknowledges the awkwardness, and builds community around the shared experience of trying to connect genuinely in a performative world.

It might work. It might be disaster. Either way, it'll be more honest than most dates you've been on recently.

My wife (40sF) and I (40sM) have been married for over 20 years and have 4 kids, two of whom are college-aged.

I don’t want to be too vague, but I also don’t want to overshare unnecessarily. The issue I’m struggling with is a recurring pattern: my wife often jumps on situations she perceives as hypocrisy on my part, but she doesn’t seem to recognize how frustrating and demoralizing this has become for me.

To be clear, we share household responsibilities. I typically do most of the cooking, clean the kitchen, and pack lunches (for the kids and for her). But here’s where the tension builds:

She tends to get overwhelmed by mess and stress, and walks around verbalizing that stress. If I gently ask her to take a breath or calm down, she often lashes back with something like, “You tell the kids to clean up, why can’t I tell you?” But I see a big difference: I’m a parent setting expectations for a child; she’s an adult directing another adult — and that dynamic doesn’t feel fair or respectful.

Here’s a recent situation that really hurt me:

Last night, our younger kids had sports and we got home late. Our high school-aged daughter hadn’t eaten, so around 8 PM, I was in the kitchen making her dinner. I noticed that our college-aged son had made coffee and left the bag of grounds open and spilled everywhere. I told him that he needed to clean it up because the mess would ruin the coffee and create more work for others.

A few minutes later, while I was still making dinner for our daughter, my wife came into the kitchen and said, “I don’t need more messes in the kitchen after I cleaned it.” I replied, “I usually clean up after myself, so I’m not sure what that comment was about.” She fired back that I had just told our son to clean something up, so why couldn’t she tell me the same?

She escalated quickly, got very upset, and got in my face about how she has every right to say that. I calmly asked her multiple times to let it go, because I haven't found a way to explain that it's not the same situation. Once we're mid-argument, logic seems to disappear.

I shut down. I made dinner for my daughter and myself (I hadn’t eaten yet), made my wife’s lunch, packed lunch for our grade-school-aged son, brought my wife tea and a snack while she watched her show, and then did a full kitchen wipe-down.

She apologized this morning for being “grumpy,” but I don’t think she really understands what the actual problem is. I’m still upset and unsure how to bring this up in a way that doesn’t lead to another argument.
