1j6kczz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/comments/1j6kczz/heres_your_talking_points_against_gavins_lame/,Here’s your talking points against Gavin’s lame excuses:,"
1. Public Service and Accountability – False Equivalence
	•	Many state services have already adapted to remote or hybrid models with little to no negative impact.
	•	If accessibility is the issue, why not improve digital public services instead of forcing employees into offices?
	•	Government call centers, DMV appointments, and caseworker interactions are often more efficient remotely because employees aren’t wasting time commuting.

2. Collaboration and Teamwork – Overstated Benefit
	•	Most collaboration already happens via email, messaging apps, and video calls—just like in global private-sector teams.
	•	In-person office time doesn’t guarantee meaningful collaboration; it often results in more distractions, useless meetings, and watercooler gossip.
	•	Many employees report better focus at home than in noisy, open-plan offices.

3. Operational Consistency Across Agencies – Bad Justification for a Bad Policy
	•	The fact that some agencies mismanaged remote work policies isn’t a reason to force everyone back.
	•	A flexible, agency-by-agency approach based on actual job requirements is more rational than a one-size-fits-all mandate.
	•	Forcing everyone to return just for “fairness” is solving the wrong problem—the answer is improving remote work policies, not scrapping them.

4. Use of State-Owned Office Space – Sunk-Cost Fallacy
	•	Just because the state owns or leases buildings doesn’t mean they must be filled.
	•	The smart move is to consolidate, sell, or repurpose office space rather than force people to commute for no reason.
	•	Keeping offices full just because they exist is wasteful thinking, not an actual policy argument.

5. Economic Impact on Cities and Small Businesses – Not the Government’s Job
	•	State workers aren’t employed to prop up coffee shops and lunch spots—they’re there to serve the public efficiently.
	•	Local economies must adapt to modern work trends, not force employees into unnecessary commutes just to keep downtown businesses afloat.
	•	Public transit struggles aren’t a state worker problem—they’re a public infrastructure problem that should be addressed separately.

6. Productivity and Oversight – Managers’ Incompetence ≠ Employee Problem
	•	If managers can’t track performance remotely, that’s a management failure, not an employee failure.
	•	Many private-sector companies have successfully adapted to remote productivity tracking—why can’t the state?
	•	The idea that people slack off at home is unproven—studies show remote workers often work longer hours and take fewer breaks than in-office workers.

7. Equity in Remote Work Opportunities – Fairness ≠ Forcing Everyone to Suffer
	•	Just because some workers can’t work remotely (e.g., DMV clerks, maintenance staff) doesn’t mean all state employees should be forced back.
	•	The fair approach is maximizing flexibility for jobs that allow it—not artificially imposing hardship on workers whose roles don’t require in-person presence.
	•	“Equity” should mean expanding remote opportunities where possible, not eliminating them in the name of fairness.

Bottom Line:

Most of these arguments aren’t about efficiency or public service—they’re about control, outdated management styles, and political optics. The real solution is a hybrid, flexible model based on actual job needs, not bureaucratic nostalgia.",1,1741450136.0,CAStateWorkers,1,1.0,False

1j6jysj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1j6jysj/anyone_ever_have_a_competitor_try_to_get_you/,Anyone ever have a competitor try to get you kicked out of a sale?,"I wish I was making this up.

Some people view estate sales as if they are the last estate sale ever held, and get way too competitive. Personally, I try to avoid confrontation. When you are in business for yourself, your reputation is a very valuable aspect, and I don't ever wish to sully it.

I waited a little over 2 hours for a number Friday morning, this older lady who looked like she had a history of hard drug usage and her daughter, literally walked right in front of me to get a number. This made me a bit peeved, but being off a number or two isn't the end of the world.

Hour between numbers and the sale, so I go to a nearby gas station to get some coffee. One restroom was in use and I really needed to go. I wait 10 minutes and apparently they had fallen asleep in there, so I tell the cashier and the other restroom, which was out of order, the nano-second the cashier takes the sign off the door, (I guess they fixed it and forgot to take the sign down) the same lady comes out of nowhere and walks right in front of me to use the damn bathroom.

I go in after her, the sink was bone dry, the toilet wasn't filling back up - meaning she was probably in there using.

Go inside the sale once it opens, and her and her daughter are literally filling tote bags full of jewelry.  There's probably 10 or so flats of jewelry and smalls.

They see me, mom calls the daughter over and they both start going through a flat, but the way the house was situated, I would need to wait for them to move to go further down the living room and look at more stuff.

I watch as they literally go through this same flat 5 times. There's maybe 8 pieces of jewelry in this flat.

So after watching them pick up these 8 items, look at them, and sit them down down five times, I realize they are purposely being in my way.

However, they finally start sauntering further down maybe a foot, and once I was closer, I see one piece of jewelry that looked kind of decent, and right as they start moving down again, I reach in the flat to pick it up, and she starts reaching for it, stops, and the daughter sees this and starts getting huffy with me, accusing me of ""taking something out of her mom's hand"". I told her I don't pull that shit and literally sat it back down in the flat, and she says ""Ya whatever buddy"" and rolls her eyes.

I have no clue what their damn issue was, but these are the types of people I hate seeing at sales.

They know I know jewelry and since that's their ""niche"", they want to act like assholes to try and have me retaliate and get me kicked out.

I can see right through their BS and I'll act like Mr Rogers to their face, and I could tell their little ""trap"" of trying to get me pissed off at them, made them even more mad when they realized I'm not falling for that shit.

She’s always been the kind of person who loves talking on the phone. Don’t get me wrong—I like it too, but only for a maximum of 20 minutes, or maybe longer if we really have something interesting to talk about.

I think she feels the need to talk to someone whenever she’s doing something—for example, grocery shopping, drinking her coffee, or basically any time she’s alone. I understand that she might be bored or just doesn’t like being alone (even though she has a child and a partner), but honestly, being called multiple times a day is just exhausting.

I live alone, and while I love spending time with friends, when I’m home, I want that to be me time. She doesn’t work, so she basically has all the time in the world.

The part that really annoys me is that she’ll call, we’ll talk for a bit, and then we run out of topics, leading to awkward silence. Instead of hanging up, she starts telling me random things like, “I was making pancakes, and one of them was smaller than the other.” She’ll literally talk about anything just to keep the conversation going (whereas I would just hang up).

So now, when she calls me, I simply don’t answer. I send her a text asking if it’s urgent, and if it’s not, I just text her back later instead of calling. I’ve already mentioned that I don’t like talking on the phone that much (except with my sister), but that hasn’t stopped her from calling me all the time.

I know she’s with other people on days she doesn’t call me. I enjoy hanging out with her, but I prefer saving our conversations for when we’re face-to-face—something that isn’t possible if she’s calling me 4–5 times a day. I even set up an automated Do Not Disturb schedule on my phone because she sometimes calls as late as 11 p.m.

Just like me, a friend of mine is also not the biggest fans of dating apps + clubs are not really the place where he wants to meet people, so thought in case someone is up for a date, of course with hopes of long term relationship, you can check his insta and reach out.

Chef, cool guy, makes killer brownies (the regular kind), loves to travel, lives in Copenhagen, so could be an interesting thing. + the shock on peoples faces on how we met (with my gf) is always worth everything. Feel free to checkout and reach out on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sebastian_christenen/) (so you also can get a feeling that he is not an internet creep)

Full disclosure, upon successful relationship after 1 year I receive a commission in terms of a nice bottle of bourbon. Also I got a permission from him to write the post, but he was not involved into it, so if it sounds weird, blame that one on me :)

Hope this kind of post is allowed, otherwise let me know and I will remove it. Have a great rest of the Saturday!

“The sign-carrying activist looks a bit lonely at the Sept. 7, 1973, sidewalk protest on Taylor Street in San Francisco’s Tenderloin District. This wasn’t exactly the White Night riots, where cop cars were burned and City Hall damaged; the demonstration featured fewer than two dozen transgender and gay participants. 

“But Chronicle photo negatives of the Hyland Hotel protest — recently rediscovered after 50 years — are still a remarkable piece of lost LGBTQ+ history. While eight blocks of the Tenderloin were designated the world’s first legally recognized Transgender Cultural District in 2016, very little photography exists of the activism that inspired it.

“Hyland Hotel at 111 Taylor St. was one door down from Compton’s Cafeteria, where a famed riot sparked in August 1966 when an LGBTQ+ patron threw a cup of coffee at a police officer trying to arrest her without warrants. The building the hotel and cafeteria shared entered the National Register of Historic Places earlier this year

“No photos of the Compton’s uprising are known to exist, but the Hyland Hotel protest made the Chronicle, after 33 ‘drag queens’ (the newspaper’s catch-all term that included transgender citizens) were evicted because of their sexuality.

“‘Drag Queens Protest Tenderloin Housing Pinch,’ the headline read, explaining that the demolition of so-called ‘skid row’ where the Yerba Buena Park and Moscone Center now rest was moving the poor to the Tenderloin. With more tenants looking for cheap rooms, the Hyland Hotel and other local dives could afford to evict transgender residents.

“‘An influx of old people displaced by the Yerba Buena Center project is “drying up” the housing supply for men who affect women’s clothes or who are having sex change operations,’ the Chronicle reported. ‘The result is that many drag queens have either left the shabby district or are bunched up in the few – perhaps – Tenderloin fleabags that still accept them.’

“Leading the revolt was Rev. Ray Broshears, a gay preacher and former military man who moved to San Francisco in the 1960s and appeared to be at the center of every protest, including some he seemingly conjured up himself.”

1j6jkaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1j6jkaf/channelingmy_inner_rage/,Channeling…My Inner Rage,"I would be ecstatic if I never heard the word “channeling” again. 

It has become an ideology, leading baristas to employ a range of tools and techniques to try and avoid this nightmarish occurrence. WDT, bottomless portafilters, pressure tampers… all seem to be considered as essential as the grinder, primarily to avoid channeling.

But do we ever stop to ask to what degree is channeling bad? Or, rather, in a commercial environment, does channelling actually matter? 

The pursuit of perfection is not new; baristas have chased the golden shot for decades: adjusting, tasting, adjusting, tasting, adjusting again. We’ve experimented with burr types, basket sizes, doses, yields, long shots, short shots, water temp, and pressure profiles. All of this was done because we cared about the taste, and when we focus on “the C word”, we tend to forget about that.

So, I’ll say it loudly for those at the back…

Shots that appear to have channeled can taste good. And shots that appear perfect can taste worse. But the sensorial difference between them, assuming your coffee is high quality, assuming your espresso machine is clean, and assuming your grind size, dose, and yield are on point, will be minimal. 

Unless you’re chasing top six in a barista competition, focus on the basics, and forget that channeling, as a concept, exists; it does you no favors to consider it.

That group chat? Deader than your abandoned LinkedIn profile. Your Instagram feed? A highlight reel of college buddies brunching in cities you can’t afford. And “let’s stay close!” somehow morphed into silently watching each other’s stories while eating cereal in bed.

Welcome to the post-grad friendship wasteland. You’re not failing at adulthood...you’re just learning to navigate what happens when the college training wheels come off and real life body-slams you.

# Why Your College Crew Ghosted (And Why It’s Not Personal)

Let’s cut through the nostalgia: College friendships were *convenience-based*. You bonded over:

* **Proximity** (shared bathrooms create trauma bonds)
* **Survival mode** (3 AM pizza orders during finals week)
* **Low-stakes hangs** (“Wanna wander to the dining hall in pajamas?”)
* **Built-in drama** (that poli-sci professor everyone hated)

Now? You’re playing friendship *Dark Souls*—no map, no tutorial, just you and a bunch of strangers who might as well be speaking Klingon.

# Why Starting From Zero Is Secretly Liberating

Your college squad wasn’t necessarily your “tribe”—they were the people you tolerated because they lived down the hall. Now’s your chance to build a crew that actually matches the person you’re becoming, not the one who thought Natty Light was a personality.

# The Unwritten Rules of Adult Friend-Making

**1. Ditch the friendship FOMO** Your ex-roommate’s beach trip pics? That’s 0.01% of their life. The other 99.99%? They’re probably doomscrolling TikTok in sweatpants too.

**2. Embrace the cringe** That coworker’s board game night invite? Go. Even if you hate Catan. Worst case? You’ll get a funny story. Best case? You’ll meet the weirdo who’ll text you memes at 2 AM.

**3. Be aggressively average** Stop waiting to be “interesting enough” to socialize. Show up to the running club as a wheezing mess. Burn the cookies you bring to the book club. People bond over flaws, not facades.

# How to Build Your Squad From Scratch

* **Hijack existing routines**: Turn your grocery store trip into a social experiment (“Nice avocados” → “Wanna split a Costco membership?”)
* **Upgrade errands**: That person you small-talk with at the dog park? “My pup needs a playdate” is code for “I need human interaction.”
* **Exploit shared misery**: Sign up for that terrible free yoga class in the park. Nothing bonds people faster than laughing through downward dog farts.

[\\""Different Paths to Connection: Balancing Shared Experiences and Intentionality in Social Interactions.](https://preview.redd.it/pcqdatdihhne1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=746e4eba51cf55bfa175d300e96eb31930501ef2)

# The Secret No One Admits

Making friends after college feels impossible because it *is*—and that’s why it matters. These aren’t friendships of convenience anymore. They’re **choices**. Every “let’s grab coffee” text is a tiny rebellion against the algorithm telling us to stay isolated.

# Here's What You Should Do

1. **Resurrect one real conversation** Text the college friend you actually miss—not the one you feel guilty about—with something specific: *“Heard that taco place we loved closed. Still mad about it. Wanna rage-eat queso somewhere?”*
2. **Commit to three awkward firsts**

* That pottery class where you’ll make a lopsided mug
* The volunteer gig where you’ll accidentally release rescue hamsters
* The bar trivia night where you’ll shout wrong answers with pride

1. **Become the “weirdo” who follows up** Met someone tolerable? Send the risky text: *“No pressure, but if you ever wanna \[activity you both mentioned\], I’m down!”* Worst they can do is… nothing. Which is where you’re already at.

# Here's something to consider;

Your future best friend exists. Right now, they’re probably:

* Hesitating outside a meetup venue
* Overthinking a DM to someone they met once
* Reading this article while eating cold leftovers

**Be the person who breaks the silence first.**

Because adulthood isn’t about finding your people...it’s about building them, one messy, awkward, glorious attempt at a time.

It was one hot Saturday at the coffee shop. 

You were there, sitting alone, wiping your face with a handkerchief for that one hot Saturday, but your face was brighter than sunshine. It's almost a year from that day, and we are not talking anymore nowadays. Good as dead, but I will never forget the first words. 

""Is this seat taken?"" you asked.

Funny thing was, I nodded at the same time, saying ""no."". Was I stupid? No, you were more stupid for wearing that pair of Wayfarer sunglasses indoors, so don't blame me for paying more attention to them.

You were seated next to me, and I could remember what I was studying at that time, hematology pediatrics. I always claim I have this photographic memory. The only common thing we had that day was wearing black tops and shorts.

I glanced at your things. Rules of Court, huh? Very neat. I guess you were pissed for noticing I looked at you several times. Wearing sunglasses indoors was a neat trick. But my only regret is that I was too sleepy that day. I guess you saw me sleeping with my mouth open.

Several nights passed, and I noticed you always came alone wearing a serious smirk on your face, usually in the late evenings. You almost convinced me you were a vampire who lures at night. The only companions you had were cigarettes kissing you every 30 minutes. What convinced me even more was that you wore black so often that I can't barely distinguish you from a barrista, not a barrister. 

One rainy evening, I left the cafe and almost had another thought on which way home to take, but you were apparently walking behind me, probably half a foot away from me. It was so awkward; I should have taken slower steps, but it was raining. If only I had the guts to say, ""Hi, I'm Isabel; I always see you at the coffee shop."" No, I didn't have. 

Next thing we knew, we were talking already. Forgive me for thinking your name is Ron for days and being poor at hearing. One of the first questions I asked you was what your age was. I blurted it out over Pesto pasta, and forgive me again for being poor at speaking. Deep inside, I was laughing for being such a moron.

Somehow, memories of the night when my exam results were released still linger as the pencils you gave me still sit on the table. You held my hand walking home on a lovely night in Makati. You kissed me on the neck. My biggest regret that night is that I should have kissed you back. 

I miss the days. The routine eats at McDonald's between study breaks, like I always said, were always ""buwis buhay."" Rather than pissed, I found it amusing that your fascination is probably infatuation with McDonald's, the food you can eat all year round. I'm glad I told you what the numbers were for in the ketchup sachets. Maybe that is enough—my memory of me in the ketchups.

I will never forget the odd things about you—the night you showed up with a Mickey Mouse t-shirt and that plastic envelope with a handle that you carried around, which I teased as your attache case. And you never used that again after. Oh, the time you chased your umbrella? It was both funny and sweet. I miss the cigarettes breaks and the highest form of virginity, which you said was virgin impacta. Or did you really say virgin compacta? I'm really poor at hearing. Whenever you were around, I had this sense of security; I could say anything that I missed the most. From nonsensical weird bus incidents to the matters of my illness and past relationships.

You were the person who once became the center of my universe, which you even did not realize. The one who stole my heart like a thief in the night. The one with whom I talked like stars at night before I slept. But when you vanished, like a star's death, you as well created an inner void in me like my very own black hole, an unexplainable area where unspeakable grief lies. 

You asked me twice what I write in blogs. I don't even consider myself a writer. A storyteller perhaps. What a good thing about me is I don't lie. You probably lied a thing or two, but surprisingly, I am not even mad at this moment. In fact, I am even happy that you made it also. I strongly believe it was the pencils I gave you. God knows how much I prayed and loved you nonetheless. 

Apparently, I still see those memories flashing on my mind every second like fireflies at night. Lovely, sometimes euphoric, but can't be grasped and relived. ",1,1741447467.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

**ROSÉ (6/10)**: She went the exact route I expected with rosie, which is a complete 180 on BLACKPINK's music. Lots of Taylor Swift / Olivia Rodrigo influence but also put her own fun spin on it with songs like drinks or coffee. I think the elephant in the room is APT. I didn't love it, but it is incredibly catchy and is succesful for a reason. I also love that she was heavily involved in writing and incorporated Korean culture. The rest of the album pales in comparison apart from a few songs imo; at some points they sort of start to blend together. Still, she had a clear vision, you can tell she was very involved with the album, and it shared a lot about her as a person.

**JISOO (6.5/10)**: I didn't expect much from this one honestly. Flower was just a recycled Solo (by Jennie) and she seems a lot more interested in acting honestly. But I was pleasantly surprised. To reference Sabrina Carpenter, Amortage is short and sweet. Earthquake is definitely the strongest track and one of the best solo songs imo. Her vocals sound better than they ever have and the production is more interesting than her previous work. The other tracks sound amazing too. My only issue is that there is no depth to her music; the songs sound like they could be plucked from any songwriter and given to any soloist. I'll give the benefit of the doubt though, because it's only an EP.

**LISA (4/10)**: She also went the exact route I expected, unfortunately. My problem with her music has always been that it isn't different enough from BLACKPINK's music to warrant a solo. There's a lack of depth to her music that gets tiring after a while, same as the group. She veered away from this with New Woman and Born Again (didn't love them but I appreciated it). Unfortunately, Alter Ego was just more of the same, despite the concept she attempted. I saw lots of people disappointed in this one too.

**JENNIE (8/10)**: Jennie has dropped hints here and there of liking R&B, so I sort of assumed that was the direction she'd go. But WOW! I knew I'd like Ruby from the moment I heard Love Hangover and ZEN, but I didn't expect the album tracks to be as strong as they are. It's cohesive, catchy, and a very clear artistic direction. Above all, it's INTERESTING, which puts it ahead of the pack for me (Dem Jointz we love you king). The only problem I have is her pronunciated being indecipherable on many songs. I wish there was more Korean because she really shines with Korean raps especially.

**SUCESS**

\*obviously not as important as the art but kpop stans will be kpop stans

**ROSÉ**: Obviously blew it out of the water with APT, which I don't think any of us expected. Her album itself also performed really well. Probably the best out of all of them (though Jennie's final numbers aren't out yet). She likely had the advantage of being the first to release, but sucks to be slow I guess.

**JISOO**: Underperformed her fans expectations. I was shocked because she was going viral the entire week leading up to the release. Earthquake is basically Flower on steroids, so I thought it'd also be huge in Korea. It still did pretty good, but definitely the worst performing of the four. The song is a hit in my playlist though.

**LISA**: This is probably the biggest shock. Out of the 3 that released full albums, Lisa's sales and streams are the lowest by A LOT. She's always been the most popular member (more solo fans than all the other 3 combined probably) and her promotion this era has been crazy, but I could tell she just wasn't clicking with the GP.

**JENNIE**: I made a post about how I predicted hers would be the least successful out of the four and got (rightfully) bullied over it lol. I'm glad I was wrong. It's still early to tell but she's killing in on Korean and international streaming and her album sales are great too. I'm shocked because her singles didn't perform as well as Rosé and Lisa's and she also had the disadvantage of fandom fatigue after being the last to release. I think her sales will be a close second to Rosé.",0,1741447263.0,kpop_uncensored,2,0.48,False

The wind is harsh today , it barely registers at least that's what I tell myself. Pretending nothing is happening while never having the luxury of actually believing it is the only way I can keep sane , the only thing that hasn't let me slip into obscurity , an empty shell that'd forget to breathe if given the chance. I think , god I know that would be better than this. I often beg for it and if I was permitted I would have stopped existing a long time ago. He knows for fuck sakes he knows and he enjoys it forcing me to feel everything while pretending I feel nothing so I do not shatter. If I shatter he'd put me back together again and again and again until I learned my lesson. I can't. I won't be put back together again. It's worse than acid , worse than fire , worse than being torn apart over and over again. The wind penetrates me like a knife every time it passes and the cold is so harsh it burns. I can feel the frostbite setting in , my fingers are weakening and I think of letting go I'am unsure of how long I can hold myself up on this ledge anyway my fingers are slipping. I grip the ground harder praying for any strength to not fail me. If I let go he'd save me but after he'd be disappointed and he'd let me know about it. His disappointment is almost worse than being put back together. He stomps his foot on my frozen fingers. I didn't  register it right away.

""Todays a special day"" He says mockingly, his voice deep and sultry, almost seductive. I strain to hear his words, my consciousness nearly slipping in and out but I have to pay attention. His words are a life line he likes when I listen. I am envious of his coat and the hot coffee he has in his hand. ""It's our 5 year anniversary today."" He says with a smile and I know he expects me to smile too. I grunt with the effort of doing so. ""Please just ask me the question , I promise to be good."" I say my voice gravelly and low, almost muted by the wind but I know he heard it. ""Since it is a very special day, fine."" He sounds exasperated almost a bit sullen and I'm terrified I will have to pay for this act of mercy later. ""Choose , die right here right now and let your family suffer the same fate as you , or beg me , beg me to spare you to keep you in my company. Tell me you want to live"" He says the words like a final judgment, the same judgment he's casted everyday for 5 years and I think I'd rather die. To put my family through the same fate as me would make me a monster worse than a monster and I cannot not put my child , my wife , my sister , and brother through that. I just can't not while I'am forced to keep my sanity. ""Please let me live , let me stay in your company , spare me your graciousness."" I have to grit out the words I'am almost too weak to say but it pleases him anyway. He grins and I am almost sad he takes his foot off my hand it means I have strain more , my grip becoming looser by the second. He bends down his bright and twinkling eyes  staring at me , he enjoys this immensely. He pours his coffee down my hand and arm and I have to strain not to fall , as the scalding liquid runs down the right side of me. The coffee was a small mercy it could have been ice cold water but thats for when he's in a mood. He allows me to hoist myself up. I almost black out from the effort but I do it anyway. I walk and sit down at a nearby tree. I know escape is futile. He chains me there. I will probably be here for days in my wet clothes that will not dry in this cold. I will get sick and infected but I won't die , he will never allow me to die just like he will never get sick of this game.

I'd been tied to the tree for a week and of course he visits me each day. He's kneeling to be face to face with me. He wants eye contact and I know it means he's feeling particularly lonely , I hate it when he's lonely. ""You're not smiling for me , I don't like that."" He says in a thickly fake sad tone. I do what he wants even if my teeth are caved in and bleeding and my jaw near broken. I do it. I've tried to defy him , tried to let it all go to give up. But ...

2 years ago

I'm done. I cannot take it anymore. I do not remember why I'm alive, why I held on for so long. He knows and I know he knows I'm not all there that I've escaped into a bliss where I feel nothing at all even as he cuts me. Even as he pours alcohol and salt into the wound. I know it upsets him and I cannot bring myself to care. I used to call him Akranos. It means ""evil of the highest degree"" in a language me and my children came up with years ago when they were still young. Now I know nothing. I cannot remember what my family's faces look like and I do not think I have the strength to force myself to. After he's done he throws me into my ""room"" . It's vacant. I don't notice the oppressive 114 degree heat admitted from vents affixed to the wall. I did not notice the smell accrued from the piss , shit and vomit in the corner of the room. I lay on the floor waiting for him to come out and play again. He does days later I hear his footsteps and I want to disappear but something different. 

A  second pair of steps from the sounds of it but it's hesitant almost as if they are being dragged. I wait with baited breath. They come up to my cell. I see him first, Akranos but then my heart sinks, my mind kicks into gear and if I had the will I would have stood up. My breath quickens as he steps into my cell the woman dragged behind him as he pulls her in with one arm. She's my neighbor. My children play with her daughter. She's my wifes best friend and her husband was like a brother to me. We've had picnics and gone on family trips. I resent it , I resent it because he knows next to my family she's close to me and he wants to be all I think about all I know. The only reason he allows  me , if I'm honest, more like forces me to remember my family is leverage so he can keep me. He's already forced me to forget everything else. Having her here only means he's trying to spark old memories once he tore out of me so he could ignite my humanity, my consciousness again. She was there for my father's funeral and for my children's first day of elementary school. Now she's here. Her mouth is taped, tears streaming down her face ,but My reaction from his view is little and he's angry about it. I can tell by the flex in his hand the strain in his jaw but most importantly the shift in his feet , this gonna hurt I think for a second  before He kicks my face, blood spatters on her clothes from my mouth. He kneels down and grabs my face. ""You're mine , you're not allowed to check out. You are my plaything and if I want you to participate in my game you will. You will give me every ounce of devotion you have."" He snarls, his face contorted in anger. 

"" I do not have to go after your immediate family directly to hurt them in order to hurt you."" He says as he grabs me forcing me to get up. He drags us all to his playroom. He straps her to the table and begins playing doctor. He does so for days keeping her alive. He does not allow me to talk to her just watch as he breaks her. A very small part of me is relieved that for once it's not me and I'm disgusted with myself. A large part hopes it ends for her soon as I realize it's never ending for me. Each day he comes in to operate experiments, cutting her open and finding ways to make the pain last. She screams and it's the worst sound I've ever heard but I do not speak I can't I won't. Everyday she begs for her life in futile desperation she'll never get out of here and him and I both know that. Eventually she stops begging to be spared. I can see it in her eyes. She's waiting for death. She has the same eyes as me. I get angry that she won't be punished like me. She's not his toy, just an accessory he'd be happy to lose. Then it hits me , I know what he wants from me. I had not talked in days I did not dare to but I cant keep watching this. ""I'm sorry , I'm so sorry I broke the rules and now you're here. He's listening. I know he is and I'am so sorry."" I say my voice horse from disuse. 

He comes in the next day and slits her throat in front of me. The reward for apologizing was granting her a quick death in the end and I'm so utterly jealous of it. I won't forget the look on her face, the screams , the tears, her wanting to go home and I know that's what he was after for me to be completely conscious and aware and I can't help but give him what he wants. He turns to me with a smile. ""Now that's a good boy , you'll learn after all."" ""He says giddy his face is an inch from mine. I look him in the eyes and the words I'm about to say come so easily and freely because I know it's what he wants to hear. ""I'll obey, I promise I'll be a good boy for you and only you."" My throat feels tight after speaking but he continues to look at me and a new sort of desire fills his eyes. He kisses me slowly and deeply. It does not surprise me this is not a reward or affection but humiliation. I'm his , a reminder he'll never get tired of me. I Am his favorite toy and if I break he'd rather put me back together again then let me go. I won't forget it again.

I’ve been taking care of them for three years while they lived separately but I have just this week moved them into an apartment together (and near me) because it was just too much for one person while they lived apart. 

For three years I’ve used, with great success, the Hero medication dispenser with my mother. I purchased one for my aunt to put into use in this new apartment, she has been in assisted living and they had been doing med management up until now, but the funds for AL have long been depleted. 

I went over last night to take a hot meal and check on them. My aunt had her medication machine (it’s a little bigger than a coffee pot and sits on the counter top) sitting in the floor beside her feet and said to me “I can’t get this heater to work”. lol.

*what the heck? Where did you get a flower from?* 

A couple that was walking in behind us laughed. They said 

*That lady outside gave it to her. It was actually so sweet*.

A few months ago, I was on a call with a guy who went from broke college student to running multiple eCom stores that generated over $18 MILLION in less than two years.

I asked him straight up:

*“Dude, what’s the one thing that made the biggest difference in your success?”*

I was expecting something like:

A secret ad strategy

A crazy product research hack

Some underground Shopify trick

But nope.

He laughed and said:

*“The difference between broke me and millionaire me? How I use my fvcking time.”*

Then he gave me his secret weapon.

**A stupidly simple app that shattered every illusion I had about my productivity.**

🤔

How many times have you ended your day thinking:

*“Damn, I worked all day… but what the hell did I actually DO?”*

You **think** you’re being productive.

You **believe** you’re making progress.

But in reality?

Three “quick” Instagram checks.

Two “short” YouToooooub videos.

A Reddit scroll “just to see.”

A coffee break that magically turned into 42 minutes.

And BAM! **Day wasted.**

I was stuck in this cycle too… Until I installed this one damn tool that changed everything.

**This app hit me like a slap in the face. A big one.**

(The kind that creates a clear before and after moment.)

It showed me **THE truth.**

No sugarcoating.

No excuses.

Just a cold, hard autopsy of my time.

And guess what?

**I realized I was sabotaging myself.**

This app made me stop procrastinating (almost effortlessly).

Every time I started drifting off… it pulled me right back.

Like an ultra-strict drill sergeant who kicks your ass every time you slack off.

(Which is probably why military guys are absolute beasts in business.)

It taught me how to manage my energy.

Turns out, my problem wasn’t taking breaks.

It was how I organized my work.

With this app, I found my ideal rhythm.

**And what about privacy?**

First thing I checked.

No creepy tracking.

No shady data selling.

Just ultra-precise stats that slap you with the truth about how you REALLY work.

**It costs $9/month. That’s cheaper than Netflix.**

Yeah, it’s a price. But guess what? **You can try it FOR FREE.👇**

Now, do the math.

*How much is your lost productivity costing you?*

*How much is being behind on deadlines costing you?*

*How much is working late to “catch up” costing you?*

**This is an investment in the most badass version of yourself.**

And right now, you get **1 FREE month** of the PRO version with this referral code:

**Code: 2AEE49**

Or just click this link: [https://rize.io/?utm\_source=refer&code=2AEE49&name=Gilles](https://rize.io/?utm_source=refer&code=2AEE49&name=Gilles)

After the free trial…

You can always uninstall the app if you decide that boosting your productivity isn’t worth the price of 1/3 of a cheap coffee per day. 😂

Try it for free for 30 days.

See what you learn about yourself.

Check if you feel that same before/after moment.

And then come back and tell me if it slapped you as hard as it did me.

The first try I used room temp black coffee and water. After that I just used distilled water and a squirt of lemon juice for acidity. Henna sat for 4-10 hours to activate, and then on my hair for 3-4 hours. I did not wash my hair for 3 days after dying. 

So how can I get a darker, richer red brown that’s closer to burgundy than orange or brown? And how can I maintain the color, when my natural hair is very dark brown? ",2,1741446055.0,henna,3,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

This is going to be a lot of text, so let’s go step by step.

  
**1. I’m Sinovar, and I’m a solo developer.**  
Yes, you might see that I don’t create games entirely on my own, but in reality, I don’t have a proper team. It’s basically just me and a bunch of freelancers who don’t even know each other.

I’m mentioning this so you understand that I’m the one writing this message—it’s not some hypothetical marketer (whom I don’t have, haha).

I want to liven up this group and my Twitter a bit in the near future, but it’s challenging because this isn’t my native language, and it’s a bit difficult for me to be active in it.

**2. Let’s start with the facts: Savvarah is my big failure.**  
I began writing the world of Savvarah in 2014, and active development on *Gods of Savvarah* started in 2019. During that time, three games were released (one of them unfinished). There were also two books (though they’re only in Russian for now).

The release of the latest game and the second book showed me that, despite the effort and money I’ve invested, I don’t really have an audience. Well, of course, there are some people who buy/read (someone must be reading this post?), but that number is very small.

**Why is that?**  
I don’t want to dwell on this in great detail. Of course, you could just say it’s my own shortcoming, but to be more specific:

* Savvarah is essentially a project for no one. People who play visual novels usually want horror, anime girls, trash-psychedelia, or something like that. Savvarah doesn’t have those elements.
* I wanted different styles, different stories—and that was a mistake. People who liked *Time of  Pariah* aren’t interested in other projects (because they’re not furry-related), while those who do like the other projects aren’t interested in *Time of Pariah.*

That doesn’t mean there won’t be any more Savvarah projects. I’ll get to that in the next point. I’m just explaining the situation as it is.

  
**3. I initially planned for this group to focus on the world of Savvara, but it will likely become a group for all of my projects.**

  
**4. Upcoming projects:**

4.1. **Legends of Savvarah: Flowers and Scorpions**  
Yes, this project will release in May–June 2025. A demo version is available on Steam.  
[STEAM LINK!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413920/Legends_of_Savvarah_Flowers_and_Scorpions/)

4.2. **DLC for** ***Legends of Savvarah: Time of Pariah***  
Scheduled for release closer to autumn 2025. More info here: [LINK!](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416500/view/545602406545622601?l=english)

4.3. **I drink Sorrel Coffee to reboot reality, but I'm being hunted by Monster Girls and armed agents.**

https://preview.redd.it/9nm34vepbhne1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d2d9377842284072012058bfecc150d698e0ea

Yes, this is also my game, which has a publisher : )  
It’s a small visual novel with anime girls.

4.4. **Legends of Savvarah: Crisis of Tigonia**

https://preview.redd.it/fkneecgwbhne1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=97708103905dc242b3894c3e76d2c3e4603d1c2d

  
This project is in a very early stage. You’ll be able to play as the King of Tigonia.  
The release date is still up in the air.

4.5. **Queen of the Orcs**

https://preview.redd.it/pce67gyzbhne1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c03d98db60b449c6359e3a28aef455a1d682fd08

  
This game is not set in the world of Savvarah.

The idea is as follows:

* You choose a character at the start of the game, one of three heroines: one is a fighter, another is skilled in magic, and the third… well… she’s a redhead : )
* Your initial goal is to become the head of an orc clan, and once you rise to the top, you move on to a “global map.”

The plan is to have a full-fledged RPG with stats and possibly some strategy elements (albeit limited).

We’ll see how well I can bring that vision to life. The release is planned for next year.

4.6. **Eternal Night**  
I’ll write more about this project later : )  
All I have so far is just this one image : )

4.7. **Legends of Savvara: Arachnum** and **Legends of Savvara: The Ocean’s Whisper**  
I’ve mentioned these projects [HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2098870/view/521952330900308804?l=english). They likely won’t be released before 2027.

**5. QUESTION! Would you like me to do an English translation of the Savvara books?**  
The first book, unfortunately, belongs to the publishing house until 2028, so I don’t have the rights to translate it yet. But I can translate the second book.

  
**6. REQUEST!** If you enjoy my games, please leave a review. It really helps with promotion. Thank you!",2,1741445761.0,legendsofsavvarah,1,1.0,False

Today, let’s dive into two of Central Florida’s most enchanting towns—Windermere and Celebration—and explore how their lifestyles stack up for Disney lovers craving magic just beyond their doorstep.

Windermere: Lakeside Luxury with a Quiet Escape
Picture this: you’re sipping coffee on your porch, the serene Butler Chain of Lakes shimmering nearby, and the faint echo of Magic Kingdom fireworks lighting up the night sky. Windermere, just 6 miles north of Disney, offers a laid-back, upscale vibe that feels worlds away from the tourist hustle. Known as the 'Town of Lakes,' it’s a haven for nature lovers—think boating, fishing, or simply soaking in the tranquility of tree-lined streets. The community leans luxurious, with gated enclaves like Isleworth boasting multi-million-dollar estates (and celebrity neighbors!). It’s close enough to Disney for a spontaneous park day—about a 15-minute drive to Magic Kingdom—but far enough to dodge the crowds. The trade-off? A quieter downtown with limited shopping and dining means you’ll venture out for nightlife. If your ideal lifestyle blends peace, prestige, and proximity to the parks, Windermere’s your spot.

Celebration: Disney’s Charming, Walkable Vision
Now, imagine strolling down a pastel-painted street straight out of a storybook, with a bustling town square just steps away. Celebration, originally crafted by Disney, sits even closer—about an 11-minute drive to Hollywood Studios—and oozes small-town charm with a magical twist. Think Main Street, U.S.A. brought to life: a vibrant downtown packed with quaint shops, eateries, and community events like farmers' markets or holiday parades. It’s walkable, family-friendly, and brimming with that Disney-esque nostalgia—perfect for those who crave a lively, social scene. But here’s the catch: its proximity to tourist-heavy Hwy 192 means you’ll feel the vacation vibe (and traffic) more than in Windermere. If you thrive on community energy and don’t mind rubbing elbows with visitors, Celebration’s got your name on it.

The Verdict?
Both towns deliver that coveted Disney closeness—Windermere at 6-10 miles, Celebration at 5-10 depending on the park—but they cater to different vibes. Windermere’s for those seeking a serene, upscale retreat with nature as a bonus; Celebration’s for the outgoing souls who love a picture-perfect, active community. Which lifestyle calls to you: lakeside calm or Disney-designed charm? Drop your thoughts below—I’d love to hear what sways your Disney-loving heart!

I'm gonna try again to quit smoking tomorrow morning, I like to have one with my morning coffee.

And the ego-dystonic thoughts always kick in during my last few drags (Because my mind is expecting this to be my last cig and it'll do anything it can to chain me to the addiction) so I end up having another and another until I'm nauseous trying to chase that last perfect cig. Then the rest of the day I end up smoking and I say ""I'll trying again tomorrow"". And it's been this endless cycle the past two years now. Has anyone else experienced this?

Problem is, I’m rather quite afraid to fully explain this to my parents (both mid-late 50’s). I’m currently living with my fiancée (25f) who has never really believed in god (losing your father at age 5 is pretty incompatible with American evangelical worldviews). My dad and I are co-owners of the townhome we live in and he pays for about half the mortgage every month. He’s rather financially supportive.

My Dad has taken us to church in our city (my parents live a little under an hour away) and it’s overall pretty nice, they have free coffee and a lot of members dress down. I’ve let him take us one time a few months ago and me alone last week with my mom and dad. I’m only really entertaining it because I’m agnostic and I know it will be devastating for both of them (or just really annoying and messy for me) to know I believe the Bible is basically mythology & that American preachers have used to control and manipulate the population into making them rich. Which is something that they may or may not know I believe to some degree). It’s honestly kind of sad that they treat Christianity (especially in this form) as fact rather than faith, and are both easily misled due to the way they were raised, how old they are, their cultural influencers, etc.. It is also sad that I’ve kind of lied to keep up appearances just to keep them off my back.

My dad asked if I maybe wanted to go to church tomorrow after I got off work yesterday, and he always sounds so nervous to ask and it makes me feel bad. I told him to just text me tonight to see if I can go. I don’t want it to become too habitual, because even though it’s not super hard to sit through or completely unhelpful or triggering, it’s just that I’m kind of living a lie every time I go in there, but it also allows me to connect with my dad makes him feel better (at least it seems like it) so I’m just conflicted and don’t know what to do. Any advice?

TL;DR My religious parents are worried about my, or more so my fiancée’s perceived lack of faith and want me to go to church with them because they think I’m still Christian. I don’t want to go but don’t want to hurt their feelings. Any fibs to get me out of church tomorrow?",1,1741445697.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

Apropos of nothing while making my morning cup of coffee, I thought about Rincewind (as one does) and about wizards more generally. Being eighth sons of eighth sons, they come from large families, right? But none of the wizards talk much about the experience of spending their earliest years in such a family. Nobody visits them at Unseen University, and they don't seem to go home to visit.

It occurred to me that this kind of sort of maps on to the practice of institutionalization, where you send a family member away to be kept by other people so you can more or less forget about them. Usually, this is done to those deemed too disabled and/or mentally ill to be kept by the family, sometimes for practical reasons, but other times for reasons of appearances.

I'm not saying it's a 1:1 comparison. In terms of intention, I figure STP was thinking more about the practices of shipping little kids off to boarding schools, combined with the medieval practice of not caring too much about what happens to every son after the third. Being autistic myself, I was thinking of it in terms of that, but in a magical way. 

And none of this is to say that I think wizards or UU should be seen in a negative light, even with idea overlaid on it. Unlike the way institutionalization works on Roundworld, the way it works on The Disc is better and even Good.",5,1741444796.0,discworld,14,0.86,False

The morning light streamed through the tall windows, casting a golden glow over the cozy space. With effortless grace, she ordered a latte, her voice smooth, unhurried, as if she had all the time in the world. A warm, flaky croissant—or perhaps an egg sandwich, she hadn’t decided yet—joined her order, and soon, she was settled into a corner seat, the steam from her cup curling in the air like an invitation.

She flipped open her book, but her gaze lifted now and then, eyes skimming the room like a secret challenge. Men came and went, some stealing glances, some lingering for just a moment too long before moving on. She was aware of them, of the way they noticed her—her soft smile, the way she tucked her hair behind her ear absentmindedly, the delicate tilt of her wrist as she lifted her cup.

And then he walked in.

He wasn’t like the others. He didn’t just glance—he looked. As if something about her had stopped him in his tracks, made him forget, just for a moment, whatever had brought him here in the first place. She felt the weight of his gaze before she saw him, and when their eyes finally met, there was a flicker of something undeniable between them.

He hesitated, as if savoring the moment, and then, with quiet confidence, crossed the café toward her.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I used to have an app on my phone that tracked your monthly period. Often, a few days before your period, I would drop by the convenience store near our apartment.  

1. Sanitary pads (night pads)  
2. The small sanitary pads you always use daily.  
3. KitKat  
4. SkyFlakes  
5. Coffee  

Those were my usual buys when you were about to have your period. You don’t like sweets, but you like KitKat. You get grumpy without coffee, so I made sure we always had some. SkyFlakes were for when you went to work without spare time to eat, so you’d have something.  

I also made sure I didn’t use my tight boxers or that they were all washed and clean because you liked using them during your period. I used to put gumamela with a tiny note together with your KitKat, saying, “I hope this KitKat makes you less grumpy. I love you.” But you rarely noticed them, so I just stopped doing it.

If you haven’t watched Gilmore Girls yet, you’re seriously missing out ! This series is an absolute my gem so heart, filled with heartwarming moments, fast paced dialogue and unforgettable characters. And the dialogues in this series made me watch it to practice my English speaking and listening skills a lot. It follows the incredible bond between Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory Gilmore as they navigate life in the charming town of Stars Hollow.

Lorelai is the ultimate cool mom she is funny, independent and full of sarcasm. While Rory is smart, kind, and incredibly ambitious. Their mother daughter relationship is truly special, built on love, friendship and lots of coffee. Seriously, they drink so much coffee ☕️

One of the best things about Gilmore Girls is the quirky town and its lovable residents. Luke the grumpy yet caring diner owner, is always there with a fresh cup of coffee and some tough love. Sookie Lorelai’s best friend is hilarious and full of energy. And of course, we can’t forget Emily Gilmore and Richard Gilmore, Lorelai is high society parents, who bring drama and surprisingly touching moments.

This series perfectly blends humor and heartfelt storytelling. Whether it’s Rory stressing out about high school until the day she graduates university and Lorelai chasing her dreams of opening her own hotel name “ Dragonfly Hotel “ or the never ending town events. I really love when there are festive scenes in Stars Hollow, whether it's Halloween or even Christmas there is always something to love. Plus, the pop culture references are endless and so fun to catch them all !

Another thing I like is the atmosphere of Luke’s Diner because is like a second home for many of the characters in the story. This scene is a moment full of warmth, hope and chemistry between the characters that makes the audience smile. No matter how many times you watch it Gilmore Girls feels like home. It’s cozy, witty, and full of my heart. If you love feel good series with amazing characters, this one is a must watch !!!

A few seconds into listening, I was instantly transported back to my parents' house in rural Pennsylvania. Back to doing my homework at the kitchen table, with my mother's dishwasher whirring in the background. I started bawling. Not out of sadness...I don't know why. Just the power of this app I guess.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from Punjab,India , currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

1j6i6ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1j6i6ul/read_the_first_two_pages_of_my_book_and_let_me/,READ THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF MY BOOK AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THNK,"The chair wasn’t comfortable, but neither was anything else. I sat in it anyway. The tag said ‘ergonomic lumbar support,’ which was a lie, but I respected the effort. It was the kind of thing people ordered online at 2 a.m., thinking it would fix their posture, their life. As if they're only bitter because of their back problems. Then it would arrive, and they’d sit in it once before deciding they’d rather just be in pain. 

I recline the seat as far back as it allows, staring up at the ceiling, counting tiles until I inevitably lose track. I do this several times a day, rotating between different reclining sofas in various sections of the store to keep the experience from going stale. 105 is the highest number I’ve ever reached. My attention span has never been particularly impressive.

After five or six rounds of counting ceiling tiles, I rake my fingertips through my scalp, working up as much grease as possible before roaming Franklin’s Furniture, pressing my hands against every surface that might betray a fingerprint. After about fifteen minutes, I retrieve the off-brand Windex and a rag, hunting down every last smudge I left behind. 

Once the store is spotless—by my standards, anyway—I take a lap around the showroom, letting my fingers trail over the fabric of armchairs and the lacquered edges of dining tables. There’s something meditative about it, this final circuit, like I’m sealing up the space for the night. I pause at a display of ceramic knick knacks, those mass-produced little owls and elephants meant to give a home some semblance of personality. I pick one up, feel its weight in my palm, and imagine pocketing it just to see if I could. But I don’t. Instead, I set it back precisely where it was and smooth my palm over the counter as if to erase the thought itself.

At 7 p.m. sharp, I clock out. Not a minute earlier, not a second later. I like my routine.  I shrug into my grandmother’s old lime green suede coat, a relic of questionable taste and even more questionable sentimentality— one of the many relics she left me, along with her apartment. Why she willed it to me, I’ll never know. I hated that woman with every fiber of my being, and I was pretty sure the feeling was mutual. My father, her only child, spent her final days watching the clock, waiting for the cancer to finish the job. He still doesn’t speak to me—not since the will was read. Oh well. ​​The apartment came stocked with an arsenal of eccentric fashion choices, and I’ve never been one to turn down anything free. 

I take the 2 train home, wedging myself into a corner seat and bracing for the usual parade of exhaustion and body odor. At 72nd, a baby starts wailing, red-faced and furious, its tiny lungs working overtime. The mother looks wrecked—dark circles, greasy ponytail, the manic edge of someone who hasn’t had a moment to herself in months. She bounces the kid, murmurs nonsense, her eyes darting around embarrassed, like she’s hoping someone will step in and save her. I stare straight ahead. The crying doesn’t bother me, but I don’t feel bad for her or her baby either. Some people hear a baby crying and their whole nervous system reacts—guilt, annoyance, some primal urge to soothe. I never had that. The train jerks forward. The baby howls like it’s being exorcised. I let my head fall back against the grimy window and close my eyes. 

I get off at 96th and walk to my building, a rotting green husk that looks like it’s been damp for decades. The doorman stands outside, arms crossed, scanning the street. He nods at me. I nod back. I’ve never bothered to learn his name. He’s been here since before I moved in, probably before my grandmother died. Sometimes, I imagine the two of them together—her sucking on a cigarette, legs crossed, telling him what to do. *Don’t just stand there. Take your shirt off. No, not like that.* The thought is repulsive, which means it’s probably true. Inside, I grab my mail—just the latest Vogue, the only subscription I keep up with—and take the elevator up. The apartment is still exactly as she left it. Heavy furniture, stiff floral upholstery, a cabinet full of porcelain figurines arranged with military precision. It’s a mausoleum of her bad taste. I toss the magazine on the coffee table and stand in the entryway for a second, feeling the room settle around me like it’s swallowing something whole. Then I unbutton my coat and kick off my shoes, same as always.

I strip down to my underwear and sink into the couch, tearing open a Light & Fit yogurt. *Sex and the City* hums in the background, muted and warped, like it’s been playing on loop for years. My grandmother never had cable, and neither do I. Her VHS collection was one of  the best highlights of my inheritance.",5,1741443781.0,writers,14,0.65,False

We have a good understanding of each other with regard to this. We’ve been together for 7 years, and married almost 5.

Each week, by Friday, I am totally done. I’m fried. It’s so hard to even strum up a conversation. I try to have a couple of drinks with him when we get home to snap myself out of it but I usually end up in the room with the doors closed and bed rotting. This usually happens to him on Thursdays. EDITING TO ADD THAT we have discussed this explicitly and have agreed that Thursdays, I expect him to not be present to allow a reset/rest time for him, and Fridays I get that. On Fridays, by the time I get home, he’s gotten about 3 beers down and is happy and vibing. Like I said, I have a couple to try and knock myself out of my burn out but it never works. 

When I got home yesterday evening, he was 3 beers in, happy, and vibing as per usual. I grabbed a beer and sat on the couch with him to try and drown out the day. The kids were playing their video games. He’s trying to talk and I’m listening, but as per usual, it’s hard for me to seem interested or carry on a conversation. I’m trying to knock the week off my back but it’s just not budging. 

Because I couldn’t budge and interact, he got frustrated and made an annoyed comment that he was going to bed. I said that it was okay, I was heading to the room soon anyways. He asked why, I said I don’t know, to watch my show and relax. He didn’t like that. I knew he just wanted to hang out with me, and he encouraged me to stay in the living room and put my show on that tv and he’d watch it with me, so I did. The moment I put it on, he starts messing with the dogs and the kids getting them all riled up. Slightly annoying but whatever. The dog has the zoomies and the kids are running and screaming because they’re all playing. I watched and smiled and enjoyed the moment, despite being somewhat annoyed, and paused the show and wait for them to stop. About 20 minutes go by and the kids get my nephew on FaceTime and my nephew, kids, and husband are all talking/yelling to each other about this game they’re all playing. 

I can’t hear the show anymore and I don’t really care to hear all of them with this game, so I turn the show off to go to the bedroom. My husband says “mommy is over it” and huffs. This morning, he mentions that he hopes it’s nice outside so we can go have a catch of lacrosse which we both enjoy as a way of trying to hang out and connect with me, but I guess appeared to lack total interest in doing so because he makes a comment about “not getting love for me for 24 hours” meaning not really talking to him or interacting with him to which I say I’m tired. Nothing bad happens, he’s just like “okay” you know? 

We’re drinking coffee together and I actually start talking and trying to have conversations with him, acknowledging that he is seeking this interaction with me to feel loved, and what does he do? Picks up his phone and barely responds to anything I’m saying or participating in the conversations/topics, seeming totally uninterested. I don’t know if he’s reversing my unintentional behavior or what.

I feel like a part of this is boredom. We moved states and away from my family and friends to a new state where I don’t have any friends and only his family. I’ve been yearning for social interactions and doing things outside of my husband and kids. My life revolves around them and my work. I need something for me. My husband has made friends at work and has started going out with them often on Fridays while I’m at home with the kids, which is totally fine, but it makes me wish I had my own friends as well. 

I have met his work friends before and they’re cool people. After his most recent outing last weekend, we discussed plans for me to come with him to a bar Friday to hang out with all of them in an effort to help me with the feeling of being lonely lately and get the social interaction I felt like I needed, since I talked about this with him as a result of him questioning on why I was so “depressed” lately. I actually looked forward to this outing but during the day yesterday, he texted me asking if I still wanted to go out last night with them because he didn’t really want to. I said no, it’s fine because I didn’t want to force him to be out if he didn’t want to after physical laboring all day. 

I enjoy shooting pool. I grew up in a bar in the south and started playing on a pool league at 17. I’ve been to Vegas twice. I stopped shooting as much after I had our first child and totally stopped after having our second. I reached out to a pool league operator in my area for information, thinking I could start shooting once weekly again as something to do for myself. I mentioned this to him, and I was met with the “the kids don’t need a mother who is in the bar all the time.” It’s once a week to shoot pool. I’m not getting hammered every night at a bar. He doesn’t agree with it.

I don’t know if he like secretly likes that I am totally without friends/family, and chose not to follow through with the plans last night because he doesn’t want me having friends or something, but I don’t know.

1j6i0oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1j6i0oz/thoughts_on_tezumi/,Thoughts on Tezumi?,"I first discovered this company a few years ago when i was going through a period of severe gut issues and decided to quit coffee for a couple of weeks to see if it made a difference (it did not, i later found out my issues are stress-induced) and when i was looking for some good quality Matcha via a normal web search, Tezumi was one of the first that came up. 

I ended up ordering a ""discovery set"" that came with 2 types of matcha, 4 types of sencha, a gyokuro, and a lovely hojicha.

I have been nothing but happy with the quality of tea, teaware, and guides. While much of their teaware is rather expensive, i know much of it is made on a smaller scale in Japan which i appreciate. They import larger amounts of tea from Japan to somewhere around New York, and ship it from there which is nice because i only wait a few days/a week for my order versus a few weeks.

My current favorites are Mastuba Sencha and Senryu Fukamushicha. In the summer i often make cold brew out of the Zansho Hojicha with a touch of sugar and it is very refreshing. ",4,1741443256.0,tea,1,0.84,False

1j6hynv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1j6hynv/the_prey/,The Prey,"The roadside bar was a dimly lit refuge, its neon sign sputtering like a dying heartbeat against the inky darkness. Sophie sat hunched over a chipped glass of cheap whiskey, her fingers idly tracing the rim as she tried to drown the ache of yet another failed relationship. The jukebox in the corner warbled a melancholy tune, its notes lingering like the ghosts of broken promises. The air was thick with the sour tang of stale beer, mixed with the faint, acrid scent of cigarette smoke that clung to the walls.

The place was nearly empty, save for a weary trucker hunched over a mug of coffee in the far corner and a bored bartender lazily wiping glasses with a rag that seemed to spread grime more than clean. Faded posters of long-forgotten bands adorned the walls, their edges curling and yellowed with age. A lopsided pool table sat near the back, its once-vibrant green felt now torn and stained, while an ancient ceiling fan churned sluggishly overhead, barely stirring the stifling, muggy air. The bar seemed alive with a quiet, ghostly energy, as if it had absorbed the sorrows of every shattered soul who’d sought solace within its walls.

The chime of the entrance bell broke the stillness as two teenagers strolled in, their laughter cutting through the heavy atmosphere like a blade. Their eyes quickly fell on Sophie, her oversized luggage beside her and her drink clutched like a lifeline. They exchanged a look before approaching her with an air of casual confidence.

“Hey there, sweetie,” the taller one said, his smile just shy of charming. “What’s a pretty woman like you doing here all alone? Not exactly the safest spot, you know.”

Sophie glanced up, her tired eyes narrowing as they settled on the grinning faces before her. She let out a resigned sigh. “Can’t a woman have a drink in peace without being bothered?”

“Easy now,” the taller one replied, raising his hands in mock surrender, though his smirk didn’t falter. “Just trying to be friendly, that’s all. No need to bite my head off. Besides, you already look miserable enough without my help.”

The taller teen chuckled, sliding onto the stool beside Sophie. His companion lingered behind, casually leaning against the bar, his hands shoved deep into his jacket pockets. “Don’t mind him,” the second one said, his tone smoother, quieter. “He’s got a bad habit of sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong. You just looked like you could use some company, that’s all.”

Sophie took a slow sip from her whiskey, her eyes fixed on the amber liquid swirling in her glass. “Maybe I could,” she admitted, her voice flat. “But I’m not in the mood for small talk.”

“Oh, we’re not exactly small-talk types,” the taller one quipped, his grin spreading. “How about big talk? Got any big dreams, big regrets, big plans?” His laughter was light-hearted, but there was a sharpness to it that made Sophie’s grip on her glass tighten.

The bartender approached, breaking the tension as he slid another drink toward the teens. They raised their bottles in a mock toast. “To unexpected encounters,” the shorter one said, winking at Sophie before taking a long swig. Sophie forced a polite smile but kept her eyes on the bar, her instincts prickling with unease.

“What about you, sweetheart?” the taller one pressed. “Where’re you headed with all that luggage? Running away, or running to?” His tone was teasing, but there was something in the way he watched her—like he was trying to read her mind.

Sophie swirled the whiskey in her glass before finally breaking the awkward silence. “I’m heading to visit my sister,” she said, her voice carrying a hint of weariness. “She lives out near Little Rock, just off the I-40.”

The taller teen perked up, his grin widening. “No way! We’re headed in that direction, too. We could totally give you a lift.”

Sophie hesitated, feeling their gazes linger on her a little too long. “I don’t know... I wasn’t planning on hitchhiking,” she said, her fingers tightening around the glass.

“C’mon, it’ll be fun,” the shorter one chimed in, his tone light but insistent. “The roads can be rough out there, and it’s better than going alone, right? Plus, we’ve got snacks—and beer!”

Something in their eagerness made Sophie’s stomach twist, but the thought of saving time—and avoiding another long night in a dingy motel—was tempting. She glanced down at her oversized luggage and sighed. “Maybe,” she said, reluctant. “I’ll think about it.”

They started chatting, the taller teen doing most of the talking while his quieter friend chimed in with the occasional smirk or nod. Sophie found herself half-listening, her thoughts drifting back to the reasons she was on the road in the first place. The past few months had been a whirlwind of pain—a nasty breakup that left her questioning everything, followed by her father’s sudden passing, which had shattered what little stability she had left.

“A little fun wouldn’t hurt,” she thought, finishing her drink in one last, defiant gulp. The whiskey burned her throat, but it was a welcome distraction from the ache in her chest. She stood up, feeling a slight wooziness creep in, and announced, “Alright, boys. I’ll go with you. Just don’t try anything funny.”

The taller teen grinned, his enthusiasm almost too eager. “You won’t regret it,” he said, grabbing her luggage before she could protest. His friend gave her a lopsided smile, holding the door open as they stepped into the cool night air.

The van was parked under a flickering streetlight, its paint peeling and rust creeping along the edges. Sophie hesitated for a moment, the twisting feeling in her gut growing stronger as she approached. The stench hit her as soon as the door slid open—a pungent mix of stale beer, sweat, and something sour she couldn’t quite place.

“Hop in,” the taller one said, patting the passenger seat. Sophie climbed in reluctantly, her instincts screaming at her to turn back. But she silenced the voice in her head, convincing herself that she was overthinking. After all, what was the worst that could happen?

The van rattled to life as the taller teen took the wheel, cranking up the volume on the radio. A cacophony of distorted rock music filled the small space, doing little to ease Sophie’s growing discomfort. She clutched her bag tightly, her gaze shifting between the blur of trees passing by the window and the two boys exchanging glances.

“So, what’s your sister like?” the taller one asked, his tone overly casual as he swerved onto the highway.

“She’s, uh, nice,” Sophie replied, hesitant. “Quiet. Works as a nurse. You know, the responsible type.” Her fingers fidgeted with the hem of her jacket as she tried to keep the conversation light.

“Well, she’s lucky to have you coming all this way,” the shorter one chimed in, his smile sharp. “Family’s important, you know?”

Sophie nodded but stayed quiet, her unease deepening with each mile. The boys’ laughter grew louder, their comments more cryptic.

“You must really trust us to hop in a stranger’s van,” the taller one said suddenly, his grin widening as he glanced at her in the rearview mirror. “Not everyone would do that.”

Sophie forced a laugh, her pulse quickening. “Well, you seem harmless enough,” she said, trying to mask the edge in her voice.

The shorter teen let out a low chuckle, leaning back in his seat. “Oh, we’re harmless,” he said, his tone dripping with something Sophie couldn’t quite place.

The van jolted as it veered onto a narrow, unpaved road. Sophie’s knuckles turned white as she gripped the armrest. “Why are we leaving the highway?” she asked, her voice sharp.

“Shortcut,” the taller one said breezily. “Relax. We’ll get you there in no time.”

But Sophie didn’t relax. The twisting feeling in her stomach was back, stronger than ever. The forest around them seemed to close in, the trees casting long, skeletal shadows that danced in the van’s dim headlights.

The music cut out abruptly, leaving only the sound of the tires crunching over gravel and Sophie’s own uneven breathing.

The van jolted as it hit a pothole, and Sophie clutched the armrest, her unease growing with every passing mile. The taller teen hummed along to the radio, his fingers drumming on the steering wheel, while the shorter one rummaged through a cooler wedged between the seats.

“Thirsty?” the shorter teen asked, pulling out a can of beer and holding it out to Sophie with a grin. “It’s cold. Might help you relax a bit.”

Sophie hesitated, her instincts screaming at her to decline. But the weight of the past few months pressed down on her, and she found herself reaching for the can. “Thanks,” she muttered, popping it open. The sharp hiss of carbonation filled the van.

She took a sip, the bitter taste washing over her tongue. The shorter teen watched her closely, his grin never faltering. “See? We’re not so bad,” he said, leaning back in his seat.

Sophie forced a smile, though the twisting feeling in her stomach hadn’t subsided. She took another sip, then another, hoping the alcohol would dull her unease. But instead, a strange heaviness began to settle over her. Her vision blurred, and her limbs felt like lead.

“Hey,” she murmured, her voice slurring as she tried to sit up straighter. “What... what’s in this?”

The taller teen glanced at her in the rearview mirror, his grin widening. “Just a little something to help you relax,” he said, his tone dripping with mock innocence.

Panic surged through Sophie, but her body refused to cooperate. The world around her tilted, the edges of her vision darkening. The last thing she saw before everything went black was the shorter teen’s smirk, his eyes glinting with something far more sinister than she’d imagined.

When she regained consciousness, the world swam into focus—a distorted, fragmented view of the eerie, dark forest surrounding her. The moon hung low in the sky, its pale light barely piercing through the heavy clouds that loomed like a suffocating shroud. Shadows stretched and twisted, the skeletal trees appearing like ghostly sentinels against the dim glow.

The rough scrape of dirt against her back sent a jolt of awareness through her, but her body refused to obey her commands. Her muscles were slack, her limbs unresponsive, as if her very essence had been drained. She tried to speak, to cry out, but her voice was trapped somewhere deep within her, reduced to little more than a ragged breath.

Her kidnappers loomed above her, their faces hidden in darkness. The faint moonlight cast their outlines in sharp relief, turning them into haunting silhouettes. The taller figure held her by the arms, dragging her with an almost casual indifference, while the shorter one walked ahead, muttering under his breath. Their voices blurred, disjointed fragments of conversation that sent shivers down her spine.

Sophie’s pulse quickened, a silent scream echoing in her mind as panic surged through her. She fought against the fog clouding her senses, desperately willing her body to move, to resist. But the dead weight of her limbs betrayed her, leaving her helpless as the forest seemed to close in, its oppressive silence broken only by the crunch of dirt beneath her captors’ boots.

 Sophie’s dragged body came to an abrupt halt as her captors reached a clearing. Through her blurred vision, she could make out the dark silhouette of a building—a small, decrepit cabin shrouded in shadow. The structure leaned precariously to one side, its warped wooden planks riddled with cracks and gaps that allowed the moonlight to filter through in ghostly slivers. Vines coiled around the edges like skeletal fingers, gripping the walls as if trying to drag the cabin back into the earth.

The taller captor adjusted his grip on her arms, nodding toward the cabin’s door. “In there,” he muttered, his voice low. The shorter one hesitated, glancing warily at the structure. “Do we really have to? This place gives me the creeps.”

“Shut it,” the taller one snapped. “No one’s gonna find her out here.”

The door creaked loudly as they pushed it open, revealing an interior that was somehow darker and more oppressive than the forest outside. Sophie was hauled inside, her head lolling to the side as her vision adjusted to the dim, musty surroundings. The air was thick with the scent of mildew and decay, and the floorboards groaned under their weight.

The faint glow of the moon seeped through the cracks in the walls, casting jagged patterns across the cabin’s interior. Strange symbols were carved into the wooden beams, their edges rough and uneven, as if they’d been etched in haste. A broken table lay overturned in the corner, surrounded by debris that crunched underfoot as the captors moved.

 

The taller man dropped Sophie unceremoniously onto the cabin floor, her body limp and unresponsive. “Watch her,” he barked, already moving toward the door. “I’m grabbing the rest of the stuff from the van.”

The shorter man snorted, crouching down beside Sophie. His breath was hot and sour as he leaned closer, sneering, “Don’t go anywhere now,” with a quiet chuckle. Sophie’s body remained motionless, but her mind was racing. The fog from the drug was starting to lift, a tingling sensation returning to her fingers. Panic swirled in her chest, but she forced herself to stay still, buying time.

The door slammed shut as the taller man left, the sound echoing through the small, oppressive space. The shorter man stood and stretched with a groan; his movements restless. “Creepy place,” he muttered to himself, glancing uneasily at the strange symbols carved into the walls.

Then, it happened. A low crackle outside, like dry leaves crushed beneath a deliberate footstep.

The shorter man froze. His head whipped toward the boarded-up window; his eyes wide. “Hey,” he called out, his voice sharper now. “That you?” Silence answered him. He swallowed hard and stepped toward the door, peering through the warped slats. “Come on, man, don’t mess with me.”

Another sound—a rustling, closer this time, low and steady. The man’s breathing quickened, his bravado slipping. “Stop playing games!” he shouted, his voice rising. The forest outside seemed to press in against the cabin, the darkness growing thicker, heavier.

Sophie’s pulse hammered in her ears as she lay motionless on the floor, her senses sharpening. She tried to tilt her head just enough to glimpse the shorter man, who was now fumbling with the door latch. “I swear,” he muttered, his voice trembling, “if you’re trying to scare me…”

Another crunch, impossibly close this time, just outside the cabin’s door.

The shorter man took a cautious step back, his bravado gone. For a moment, it was silent again—eerily, impossibly silent. Then, the doorknob rattled.

The shorter man’s hand trembled as he pulled a revolver from his waistband, the metal glinting faintly in the fractured moonlight. “Who’s out there?” he barked, his voice cracking as he aimed the weapon toward the door. The forest outside fell silent, the oppressive stillness pressing against the cabin walls like a living thing.

For a moment, nothing moved. Then, the sound of footsteps—slow, deliberate—retreated into the darkness. The man gulped audibly; his knuckles white as he gripped the revolver. “Coward,” he muttered, though his voice lacked conviction. He glanced back at Sophie, still sprawled on the floor, before steeling himself. “Stay put,” he growled, though it was unclear whether he was speaking to her or himself.

With quaking hands, he unlatched the door and stepped outside, the creak of the hinges echoing into the night. The forest swallowed him whole, his silhouette disappearing into the shadows. Sophie lay frozen, her heart pounding as she strained to hear. The minutes dragged on, each second stretching into an eternity.

Then, it came—a bloodcurdling scream that tore through the stillness, raw and primal. It was followed by the sharp crack of gunfire, the sound reverberating through the trees. Sophie’s breath hitched, her body jolting as adrenaline surged through her veins. The fog clouding her mind lifted in an instant, and she scrambled to her feet, her movements frantic and unsteady.

She stumbled toward the door, slamming it shut with all her strength. The old wood groaned under the force, and she fumbled with the lock, her fingers trembling. The cabin seemed to close in around her, the air thick with the weight of impending doom. Outside, the forest was silent once more, but Sophie knew—whatever had taken the man was still out there. And now, it was coming for her.

The silence outside stretched thin, every creak of the cabin walls amplified in Sophie’s ears. Her breath came in shallow gasps as she pressed her back against the door, straining to hear any movement beyond it.

Then came the knock—soft, measured, almost polite.

Sophie froze, her heart pounding in her chest. A man’s voice followed, calm and steady. “It’s okay,” he said, his tone gentle, almost reassuring. “You’re safe now. The men are gone. I took care of them.”

The words hung in the air, dripping with an unnatural calm that sent shivers down Sophie’s spine. She didn’t answer, didn’t dare move. Her fingers tightened around a splintered piece of wood she’d picked up from the debris.

“It’s alright,” the voice continued, more insistent now. The doorknob rattled violently, sending tremors through the fragile wood. “You can open the door. I’m here to help.”

Sophie’s instincts screamed at her to stay silent, to stay hidden. She shook her head, whispering to herself, “No… no, no, no.” The man’s tone changed, a sharp edge creeping into his words. “Come on,” he said, his voice louder, impatient. “Open the door.”

When she didn’t respond, the door shuddered under a sudden, forceful kick. Sophie cried out, scrambling back as the door creaked on its hinges. “I said open it!” the man roared; the calm façade replaced by anger.

Adrenaline surged through Sophie’s veins. She scrambled to her feet, her body moving on pure instinct. Grabbing the remnants of the broken bedframe, she shoved the jagged pieces against the door, wedging them between the floorboards and the handle. The door rattled again, the force behind it growing stronger, but the makeshift barricade held.

Sophie backed away, her eyes darting wildly around the cabin for anything else she could use to defend herself. The pounding continued, each kick reverberating through the small space, but Sophie didn’t let herself give in to the fear. Not this time.

The pounding on the door grew louder, each strike sending splinters flying from the fragile wood. Sophie pressed her back against the barricade, her breath coming in ragged gasps. “Sophie,” the man’s voice called, soft and coaxing. “I know you’re in there. Open the door, and I’ll keep you safe.”

Her name on his lips sent a chill down her spine. She shook her head, clutching the splintered piece of wood tighter. “No,” she whispered to herself, her voice trembling. “No, no, no.”

As the door shuddered under another violent kick, her eyes darted around the cabin, searching for something—anything—that could help her. That’s when she saw them. The carvings on the walls, faintly illuminated by the moonlight seeping through the cracks, seemed to shift and twist before her eyes. She squinted, her heart skipping a beat as the shapes came into focus.

It was her. The carvings depicted her life in haunting detail—her childhood home, the faces of people she’d loved and lost, even the bar where she’d been just hours ago. Her breath hitched as she stepped closer, her trembling fingers brushing against the rough wood. The final image was of her, here in the cabin, her face frozen in terror.

A scream tore from her throat as the door behind her groaned, the hinges threatening to give way. The man’s voice grew sharper, more insistent. “Sophie! Open the door!”

Panic surged through her, and she spun around, her eyes locking onto the small, grimy window at the back of the cabin. Without thinking, she bolted toward it, gripping the splintered wood like a lifeline. The door cracked behind her, the sound of splintering wood echoing through the cabin.

With a desperate cry, she swung the piece of wood at the window, shattering the glass in a spray of jagged shards. The cold night air rushed in, stinging her face as she hoisted herself up. Her muscles screamed in protest, but she forced herself through the narrow opening, ignoring the sharp edges that tore at her skin.

As she hit the ground outside, she didn’t stop to catch her breath. She pushed herself to her feet, her legs burning as she sprinted into the forest, the darkness swallowing her whole.

Sophie sprinted through the dense woods, her breath ragged and her legs burning with every step. The trees loomed around her, their twisted branches clawing at her clothes as if trying to hold her back. It felt as though the forest itself was alive, its ancient roots and gnarled trunks whispering secrets to one another, relaying her every move to the stranger. The oppressive darkness pressed in on her, the faint glow of the moon barely piercing through the canopy above.

Her heart leapt when she spotted the van in a small clearing ahead. Relief surged through her, but it was short-lived. As she drew closer, the scene before her froze her in her tracks. The van’s tires were slashed, the rubber shredded and useless. The tall teenager lay sprawled face down in a pool of blood, his lifeless body illuminated by the pale moonlight. Sophie’s stomach churned, but she forced herself to look away, her survival instincts kicking in.

She turned sharply, veering off the trail and plunging deeper into the forest. Her only hope was to lose her pursuer in the labyrinth of trees. The ground beneath her feet was uneven, littered with roots and fallen branches that threatened to trip her with every step. She pushed forward, her lungs screaming for air, her mind racing with thoughts of escape.

Then, it happened. Her foot landed on something taut—a trip wire hidden beneath the leaves. Before she could react, the rope snapped tight around her ankle, yanking her off the ground with brutal force. A scream tore from her throat as she was hoisted upside down, the blood rushing to her head. She dangled helplessly, the rope biting into her skin as she twisted and struggled.

The forest fell silent again, the only sound her ragged breathing and the creak of the rope swaying in the breeze. Panic surged through her as she clawed at the knot around her ankle, her fingers trembling. She knew she didn’t have much time. The stranger was coming.

Sophie dangled helplessly, the rope biting into her ankle as she twisted in the air. Her screams echoed through the forest, but the oppressive silence swallowed them whole, leaving her cries unheard. The blood rushed to her head, her vision blurring as she struggled against the knot, her fingers raw and trembling.

Then, he appeared.

The stranger emerged from the shadows, his movements slow and deliberate, as if savouring the moment. His ragged clothes hung from his wiry frame, smeared with dark stains that glistened faintly in the moonlight. His face was a mask of twisted delight, a grotesque smile stretching across his features. In his hand, he held a long, gleaming knife, the blade catching the faint light as he turned it lazily.

Sophie’s breath hitched, her screams faltering as terror gripped her. “No,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Please, no.”

The man tilted his head, his eyes glinting with a predatory gleam. “You’ve got such a lovely voice,” he said, his tone soft, almost tender. “I’ve been listening to it for weeks now. Watching you. Waiting for the perfect moment.”

Her heart pounded in her chest as his words sank in. He took a step closer, the knife gliding through the air as he gestured with it. “You didn’t even notice, did you? How I followed you through the city, through the woods. Always just out of sight, always in the shadows.”

Sophie’s body trembled, her mind racing for a way out, but the rope held her fast. The stranger’s smile widened as he raised the blade to his lips, his tongue flicking out to trace its edge. “And now,” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper, “you’re mine.”

His laughter erupted, a chilling sound that echoed through the forest, filling the air with its eerie resonance. Sophie’s screams returned, raw and desperate, but the forest remained indifferent, its ancient trees standing as silent witnesses to her plight.",2,1741443078.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
