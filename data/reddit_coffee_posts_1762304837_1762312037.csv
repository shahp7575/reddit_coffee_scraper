1oorrkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1oorrkb/relatable_reese_says_her_son_talks_to_tommy_three/,Relatable Reese says her son talks to Tommy three times a day,"Reese Quibell stands up near the beginning of her stream and her shirt is so short that her stomach hangs out of it. She says when she went to the doctor today, she found out she has gained 8 pounds. ""That'll ruin your day,"" she says, adding that weighing 189 pounds should give her haters some material to work with. She complains that going off Rybelsus for five weeks really messed her up and now her doctor has her on a lower dose and she's still eating too much. She's wearing another new hat from Southern Goods Mercantile and those aren't cheap.   
  
Reese took the highest dose of Rybelsus for years and she tells a nurse in the chat she's concerned because if she moves to Ecuador, she won't be able to get that medication for her diabetes. She claims that she doesn't eat anything until 3 p.m. but then she snacks a lot at night. When a chatter asks why she's moving to Ecuador, Reese says that's where her peace is, it's her favorite place on Earth and Tommy lives there.   
  
GLP-1 drugs can cause pancreatitis and Reese is at higher risk of getting it because she had it this summer, she says. A chatter suggests Reese could fly back to the United States every six months and get Rybelsus and Reese says she'll be flying back about every three months. She says she's going to keep her current doctor, her health insurance and her phone plan. She says she can switch to Ozempic when she moves to Ecuador but she doesn't want to do that. Her doctor suggested she could switch to Jardiance for her diabetes, which is not a GLP-1.   
  
She claims her doctor didn't care when she told him that she has been self-prescribing herself prednisone and he gave her more. Her doctor also prescribed a muscle relaxer for her neck pain, she says. Reese claims her doctor talked to her for about 45 minutes, he was very funny and he recorded their entire conversation.  
  
Reese then starts throwing shade at Marilyn Honig for reposting the Long Con video on her channel. Reese calls it old news that nobody gives a shit about.   
  
She compliments herself and Tommy on their Cults and Crims stream from last night, calling it hilarious. Tommy interrupts her stream with a text and she says she hasn't talked to him much today because she's been out and about. She thanks everyone who became members on Cults and Crims last night.   
  
When a superchatter asks Reese how to send money to her Venmo account, Reese claims she doesn't know and says her mods will have to put up those details. A mod immediately pops up all of Reese's cash app information and Reese thanks her, saying that it really helps when people send her cash instead of superchats because YouTube doesn't take 30 percent of the cash. She starts asking her chat to come up with more ideas to rename Cults and Crims and they do. A chatter tells Reese it's like she and Tommy are becoming missionaries of a sort by moving to Ecuador.   
  
Reese claims that she plans every year what she's going to buy on Black Friday. She says she doesn't like to just blow money, which made me laugh out loud. She alleges she's not going to buy clothes, shoes, handbags or furniture this year because she's trying to downsize. She's going to buy a year's supply of Paula's Choice skin care products, she says. Reese keeps getting interrupted by texts. She says she feels scammed by Sephora because their Black Friday discounts aren't as steep as she would like.   
  
She says she has already made a lot of friends in Ecuador and she claims there are no rules there, adding that she saw a lot of babies just being held in cars instead of being strapped into car seats. ""No one cares what you do,"" she says. Reese is in for a rude awakening if that's what she really thinks.  
  
She claims her stepdad is super happy for her plan to move to Ecuador. She says she may come back to the United States and that she plans to get a two-year visa. She says there's no question that she will be allowed to make money on YouTube while she's on a nomad visa.   
  
She talks about the private prep school in Ecuador where she claims she wants to send H, but she says tonight that it costs $300 a month. Last week, she said it cost $200 a month, but there's no way to tell if she just misspoke or if she's making things up off the top of her head about that school. She claims that she has spoken to a lot of parents who send their kids there.   
  
She says she's going to sell her 2023 hybrid Honda CRV before she leaves for Ecuador ""and that will give me a nice cushion to live on."" Reese claims she can work from anywhere with her other job.   
  
She claims she's constantly worried about money because she never knows month to month how much money she will make from her YouTube channel. Reese alleges she has a really big hospital bill that she needs to pay off because she has really good credit. ""I don't want to ruin my credit,"" she says. Then she immediately claims she has money set aside for emergencies. Emergency room visits are exactly the kind of expenses people use emergency funds for, Reese.   
  
Reese claims that she looked at apartments when she was there ""and you can get a really nice apartment a block from the beach for $300 a month,"" she says. ""You can buy that exact same apartment for $50,000."" When a chatter asks how Reese would transport her pets to and from the vet, she says in Ecuador vets make house calls.   
  
She says she wants to sell the motorcycle that Tommy left at her house but then adds that he wants to figure out a way to ship it to Ecuador. He would definitely want her to sell it so she can have the money to move, she says.  
  
Reese alleges that H really loves it in Ecuador and that he's not attached to anything in Tennessee. Before Reese moved to Tennessee, she raved about how Tennessee was H's favorite place and how he was so close to his grandparents who live there. Now she claims he's not attached to anything in the United States. ""He talks to Tommy three times a day,"" she says. That is extremely alarming and is a huge red flag. That poor kid needs friends his own age and a chance at a normal life. H should not be leaning on or looking up to a con artist who spent so many years in prison.   
  
She claims H told her yesterday that he's never had a man in his life who cares about him more than Tommy, but months ago Reese told her channel how heartbroken H was by Tommy and how disappointed H was in him. She admitted while sobbing that her screaming fights with Tommy had done further emotional damage to H. ""Tommy has completely apologized to him,"" Reese claims tonight. ""I like having people in my life who are fuck-ups."" She says she cares about how people take accountability and clean up after their mistakes.   
  
Reese is encouraging others who don't feel at home where they live to consider moving to Ecuador. Her new friends there don't speak English. She claims she had a therapy session today that rocked her socks off.   
  
She found a church she loves in Ecuador, she says. She and Tommy met the American pastor and his Ecuadorian wife for breakfast one day. Her omelette cost 25 cents and came with coffee and toast, she says. She and Tommy went out for steak and the filet she got cost $10. Reese needs to quit talking about being a vegetarian when she keeps bringing up eating steak.   
  
Reese finally admits on her channel to drinking contaminated water multiple times in Ecuador and says she's not sure if that made her sick or not.

When a chatter asks if Reese is going to start taking Spanish lessons, she says she doesn't know and that she might just pick the new language up on her own.   
  
Reese holds up beaded bracelets that a woman in Ecuador named Mona made for her. She says they're like bracelets she used to order from Hart that are ridiculously expensive at $85 each. When she first went to Mona's booth, Mona told her each bracelet cost $2 and she offered to make Reese custom bracelets for $7 to $10.   
  
She made a bag full of stuff for Reese and Reese says Mona insisted on Reese picking out a gift even though Mona is extremely poor. Tommy told Reese he was going to give Mona a lot more money than she was asking for anyway, Reese claims, adding that Tommy gave Reese two $20 bills and told her to give that to Mona on top of what Reese paid her. I think Reese is trying to rehabilitate Tommy's reputation because she complained for months about how Tommy made her pay for everything during their time together and how he couldn't afford much of anything.   
  
Reese claims she overtipped everyone in Ecuador and says no one wants to take advantage of others there even though they're so broke. ""That changed me,"" Reese says, adding that's what really sold her on Ecuador. She actually says that there is no crime there. Wow, she is delusional.   
  
Reese leaves to go get the jewelry that Mona made for her and then she starts showing pictures that Tommy took of her and Mona. She shows some of the bracelets Mona made for her and says she'd love to set up a store so that Relatable Reese fans could buy items from her. ""It would change her whole life,"" she says.   
  
Reese says her biggest hope is that God is going to use her to do something really good there. She says she would love to start a shelter and help animals. She brags about Tommy going to a rehab center once a week and he and Johnny making 40 sandwiches for patients there.

She shows pictures of herself and Tommy in Ecuador and claims she really likes the idea of not having a car there. She says people can change and she's grateful for the Long Con video she did because it caused her to grow and change.

I recently moved to Dhaka for work and I’m still getting to know the city — would love to meet some new people here!

A bit about me:
I’m Sunil, originally from Hyderabad, India, currently working as the COO of The Mahal Fashions (Sydney & Dhaka) and managing a few international retail projects. My background is in luxury brand management and business consulting, so I love conversations around design, travel, culture, and entrepreneurship.

Outside of work, I’m quite social and easygoing — enjoy exploring cafés, weekend getaways, and meeting people from creative, business, or academic backgrounds.

I’m hoping to connect with educated, positive, and like-minded people in Dhaka — both men and women — who enjoy good conversation, food, and new experiences.
If there’s anyone open to meeting up for coffee, dinner, or just hanging out socially, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to building a small circle of interesting friends (and maybe even finding someone special 😄).

📍 Currently based near Gulshan / Banani area.
DMs are open — happy to chat first before meeting.",1,1762311760.0,relationship_adviceBD,0,1.0,False
1oorqei,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1oorqei/laundry_power_trip/,Laundry power trip.,"I had to move back in with my mom a few months ago due to the cost of living. We’ve had a very tumultuous relationship my whole life but she promised me she would leave me alone this time. I’ve been through an abusive relationship that included financial abuse and my mom had been pushing for me to come live with her for years. I finally gave in when I truly couldn’t afford to live on my own anymore. 

There’s been quite a few arguments lately and I feel like I’m going crazy. Yesterday, I woke up at 4pm (night shift worker) and the moment I got up my mom started talking about all the things she had to do, including laundry. She used the machines all weekend and stopped me from continuing my laundry on Saturday saying she “gets the next turn”. So I said I needed to do laundry because I have no clean scrubs to wear to work the next two nights and they need to hang to dry. She went for a nap and texted me “you better do your laundry ASAP or I’ll be doing it during the day tomorrow when you’re sleeping”(my room is in the basement where the laundry machines are). To me this was a clear power trip and threat to inconvenience me if I dont do what she wants. She works from home and stays in her pajamas all day. I replied “ I just got up, can I eat? You had the machines all weekend, let me live. I’ll be at work for the next 2 nights so you can do all the laundry you want then.”. 

When she woke up and saw the texts she said “what’s this?!” All outraged. I said I was responding to what she said and she continued arguing with me. It turned into a big screaming argument. She’s extremely controlling and takes everything that isn’t “yes maam” as a direct attack. I called her out on the power trip about the laundry and she denied it. She doesn’t think she’s in the wrong. 

I made the mistake of allowing her to drop me off for work and on the way I asked her if she was going to acknowledge what happened. She said that it happened and it’s over and it doesn’t need to be discussed. I really wanted an apology from her and for her to admit she was wrong and since she doesn’t think she’s wrong, it ended up in another argument. I accept my part of the blame for allowing myself to be baited into this argument and for letting things escalate. I just get so triggered when she won’t listen to me and keeps repeating the same thing over and over. She said “I could have gone down and done my laundry anyway but I didn’t.” To me this highlighted the deeply ingrained expectation from her that I need to be “grateful” and “show appreciation” for everything she does, even allowing me to use her laundry machines. She acts like she’s doing me a favour. So I called her on it and said I won’t be on my hands and knees thanking her for allowing me to do basic life needs. I left the car by saying she primed me to be a perfect abusive victim and that’s what ended up happening with different people in my life. 

Me standing up for myself and raising my voice have been newer reactions since coming out of my abusive relationship. I’ve truly had enough and feel like I’m going to explode whenever my mom triggers me. 

TLDR; mom had the laundry machines all weekend and works from home. Yesterday I needed to wash my scrubs bc I was working the next two nights and had none. She then demanded that I do my laundry immediately when I had just woken up or she would be waking me up to do laundry today while I was sleeping (I’m a nightshift worker and the laundry is in the basement where my room is). I called her out and refused to drop everything before I had even had coffee or eaten and she was outraged that I didn’t meet her demands, ended in a huge fight. The fight continued on today when I accepted a ride from her and she refused to admit she was wrong. 

I guess I just wanted to vent to people who understand. Am I in the wrong here? How do you stop yourself from reacting when they push you?

My boyfriend (let’s call him A) and I started dating at the end of March, so we’ve been together for about 8 months. We share similar traits, we’re both introverted and tend to be passive communicators. We usually don’t text first unless someone reaches out, and we don’t go out unless friends invite us.

A plays mainly offline AAA games and doesn’t use social media. I enjoy online mobile games, participating in game communities, creating content, making memes, and designing characters.
I’m online a lot because I also run my business there.

Sometimes I want to share things I create or find online with him, but he doesn’t really get it because he isn’t into fandom culture or social media. He doesn’t share much about what he plays either, he plays a lot of different games, and the one title we both liked, he doesn’t play anymore. When I bring it up, I feel like he’s not interested in talking about it.

When we first started dating, we talked often and even went out together for coffee or walks in the park. But now, we can go weeks without texting (we don’t live together). I try to start conversations, but they often feel dry and fizzle out, and then we fall into another quiet stretch.

I want to work on this relationship. I care about him, but I’m starting to feel lonely, especially when I see friends with partners they can talk to and connect with easily.

How can I improve communication and rebuild connection in this relationship? What steps can I take?",1,1762311675.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1oorozs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1oorozs/advice_to_help_me_continue_in_my_journey/,Advice to help me continue in my journey……,"43 year old male here, on March 7, 2025 I weighed 230, woke up that day and decided I was going to stop drinking alcohol and start eating healthy because I was unhappy with myself, and I did.  It’s now November 4, 2025 and I’m down to 171.8 and feel like I’ve plateaued doing what I’ve been doing.  

Basically I stopped drinking alcohol, I pretty much only drink (a lot of) ice water and a black iced coffee every morning before work, sometimes the coffee has sugar free vanilla in it, but not always.  Sometimes I drink various flavors of Liquid Death waters as well, but not a lot.  

I stopped eating all breads and pastas, zero dairy except for Greek nonfat yogurt every morning with blueberries added in, cut out all red meat, no processed meats either and have tried to eliminate as much sodium and sugar as humanly possible.  I’ve basically been living off salads, air fried turkey and chicken, fruits and vegetables, some Made Good organic granola bars. I don’t do cheat meals, but if I’m cooking my kids a pizza or something I’ll have just a bite.  I’m pretty good about not going against whatever I choose to do, I don’t have cheat meals.  

Also, I haven’t exercised one time since I started this.  All my changes have been solely what I put into my body.  I have an active job though, I’m on my feet all day constantly moving and lifting things.  

With that being said, I am pretty happy with where I’m at with my weight loss, it really hasn’t been too hard at all, I’ve just had to stick to the choices I’ve decided to make and thankfully it’s been working.  I don’t really feel like I want to lose much more weight.  10 pounds maybe, idk, I really didn’t have any goals when I started this I just wanted to see what happens.  What I’m most interested in is just kind of tightening up what I’ve done so far, and I don’t really know where to take my journey from here.  I guess the obvious thing to do is to start exercising, but I am suuuuuuper lazy and really don’t want to do that.  😂

I take daily blood pressure and cholesterol medication, and have for a few years now.  I don’t take any multivitamins, but I have been considering adding that, but I don’t know how that would affect my weight management.   I’m assuming I’ve cut out a lot of nutrients by choosing to eliminate so many things from my diet, so how would adding a multivitamin to my daily regimen affect my weight?  

I’m an idiot when it all comes to this, but I’m trying, and I have people stop me at work every day talking to me about my weight loss, so I know it’s working, and it feels really good.  I’m just at the point now where I’d like to do more, and short of starting to exercise I don’t know what else to do.  😂  I reallllly don’t want to start exercising, if you couldn’t tell.  

Also, I’d just like to mention something that never even popped into my head before starting all of this.   I’ve done this all on my own, (with a lot of help from the very useful Yuka app) and it’s been pretty disheartening that I’ve had a few people ask me what kind of weight loss shot I’ve been taking.  It sucks a bit knowing there’s people out there who will just assume that.  

Thanks for any comments in advance.

TLDR:

Went from 230-171, feel like I’ve plateaued, would like advice on breaking through this wall.

\-----

***And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…***

Ramsay dismissed the teams, as they’d make their way out of the dining room, with Allison saying in her confessional that being up on that slate is her sign that she’s going to kick even more ass and try to get through to her teammates that she can do brilliant in a professional working environment, and she’ll be head chef sooner than they realize it. The Red Team would return to the dorms, feeling the weight of Wanda’s elimination. Though Ruben says in his confessional that it was for her own good anyways, before scratching that, and clarifying it was for the good of the Red Team, so it’s not like it’s a huge loss… He’d boldly mention that with the weakest link gone, they can finally start winning, but Henri does remind him that with attitude, he might need to tone it down, because cockiness does get somewhere not excellent. Though Ruben does tell the ‘old man’ that he may seem to know a lot of shit, but he saw what he was doing; fucking up the french fries they had on supply, and he tells him that anything else like that, and they’d get infected with spuds. This earns a few confused stares from the other Red Team members, with Kara asking Ruben what that’s supposed to mean. Ruben wouldn’t answer that question straight away, but would assume himself as the one in charge of the Red Team for next time they do another service. In her confessional, Isabela says that Ruben may have a lot of optimism and prowess in what he can do, but at the same time, she knows he’s a stubborn hothead who seems a bit paper-skinned. The Red Team would talk about what they can do to improve for the next service, but Isabela would make a strict point that first things need to come first; communicate. Kara agrees to this, as she states in her confessional that being a leader comes with a lot of perks and power; she hopes to become someone strong and competent like Leslie from *Parks and Recreation*, even giving Amy Poehler a shoutout. Kara also talks to Henri, seeing how he’s a fellow Canadian contestant on the show. Henri says yes, he was born and raised in Quebec, but he’s become a dual citizen for both Canada and the United States, but he mostly rotates between Montreal and Plattsburgh to mentor new chefs whenever he’s not working on cruise ships. The two continue talking amongst themselves what it feels like to become Chef Ramsay’s next protege, the prospect too hot to give up. 

Meanwhile, the Blue Team were relieved to have finished another dinner service, with JC optimistically stating in his confessional that there’s about fifteen chefs left, and chances are, he’s got a one in fifteen chance of making it; all he needs to do is work by example, show dedication, and viola; it’s like he never left home at all. Though David would state in his confessional that he’s happy they won service tonight, he does note a couple of liabilities; especially mentioning JC, because he was dragging on a few Appetizers, but mostly the Entrees. David would borrow JC for a moment, and when they’d talk out on the patio, David would tell JC that he’s happy they finished service, but he also expresses concern for him; noting his Meat station mistakes. JC nodded and apologized, stating that he didn’t think cooking meatballs or burgers was difficult, and he had his own burgers in contention for winning the Punishment Pass Challenge. David does advise him that it’s fine, but he just wants him to focus on the next service, because chances are, his stock could be low as of now, and he’s had to make risky gambles to get back on. JC would ask David if he’s lost some money playing poker… David would think about it for a second, before letting out a heavy sigh, stating that there were moments in his life when he dealt with poker that he lost big money… And as he’d tell JC his story, David would mention in his confessional that nearly two years ago, he had lost a lot of his savings due to him making a major risk that proved fatal. Though he managed to scrape some money back, it’s still not enough in his eyes, as it really shook him hard with how much he had to surrender. That’s why he wants to work hard like the way he’s doing, and get better with how he manages not just his finances, but also himself. 

Meanwhile, the two teams were mingling with each other, with Samuel and Rio getting praises from people like Kara, Edward, Dani, and Shayna of how great they were performing out there. Samuel couldn’t stop blushing, and he’d state in his confessional that he’s here to become Ramsay’s next protege, not to be a celebrity; though he does contradict himself that winning Hell’s Kitchen does count for being a celebrity. Rio, however, does express optimism on being able to prove himself, stating that he knows he might not have a chance, but at the same time, he doesn’t want to give up. Kara sat next to him, and they’d bond with each other on getting to find that chance, with them telling each other fun life stories, or their biggest achievements in their respective lives. Kara was astonished to hear Rio’s been featured in a magazine with Dean Fearing, the ‘father of southwestern cuisine’, but she, as well as the others, don’t understand why he hasn’t been mentioned past that. Though Rio does state that he’s been having a lot of trouble finding a higher paying job, and that’s another reason why he’s had to take two jobs at once. Edward makes a confessional of how he can’t imagine how it feels to be in Rio’s shoes, but at the same time, there is the pressure of maintaining something, and he scratches the back of his head before he could finish his sentence. Shayna would also come over to Rio and tell him she knows it can be a bit tough finding a better job than the two he has, but she assures him that as long as he gets on the right footing, he’ll be bound for success. Rio smiles at this, and tells his fellow comrades that he’ll look into starting tomorrow. Over in the dorm kitchen, Henri was talking with Tem, Isabela, Allison, and Freddie when they noticed Rio’s confident boast; he’d state the ‘kid’ must have reached a breakthrough, but Allison does make a joke that it’s either that, or he’s still excited that he was Barney the Dinosaur for a night. Isabela does smile at this, and she expresses confidence in her confessional that she knows things will go right tomorrow, and she’ll stop at nothing to ensure that happens. Eventually, everyone would go to bed for the night…

\-----

**Challenge**

The next morning, both teams would scamper out of bed to get dressed, as there is yet another challenge waiting for them. However, JC would immediately make note of a certain smell that’s coming to mind, and he would mention in his confessional that he knows it all too well… As soon as they make it down to the kitchen, they would find Ramsay standing behind a white-clothed table, with a few domes over plates. He would greet everyone upon their arrival, telling them that he’s got quite a treat for them to give them, and by that, he means something delicious for everyone to witness… Ramsay presented these special dishes, uncovering every dome; ropa vieja, rabo encendido, and picadillo. The British chef invited them all to try them, suggesting it’d be a ‘delicious breakfast’. Everyone took their turns tasting them, and upon them all finishing, Ramsay asked them what each dish has in common, to which JC immediately raises his hand. However, rather than giving him the go-ahead to answer, Ramsay explains he wants to give everyone an idea of what they’ll be in for today’s challenge, because it has a lot to do with Miami’s heritage… He would first have Marino dim the lights in the dining room a bit, with the maitre d’hotel doing so, creating a suspenseful atmosphere, with Shayna wondering if someone’s going to appear out of nowhere; if it does, she’ll faint. Ramsay would have everyone direct their attention to a panel, which had its lights turned off. He would take out his phone and activate something; first, Alberto Rivera’s *Eternity*, trying to create a musical, suspenseful feel. Later, he’d press something that activated the panel, making it illuminate colorful water that was raining down from the top of the panel to the bottom; at first, a cerulean blue light, and, thanks to added effects, Ramsay would add tropical ambience noises, complete with ocean wave sounds, soft wind, bird tweets, among others… Everyone was in awe as they watched the water lights hypnotizing them; nobody dared to speak up, as they didn’t want to ruin the moment. The water lights in the center would slowly change color to a royal blue, creating a shape of a certain country… Tem turned her head to find JC next to her already bursting into tears… JC tearfully addressed this in his confessional, stating that because Cuba is where his family originated from, he’s happy that they’re doing a challenge completely based on his roots. Ramsay kept the miniature light show on for a bit longer, before he turned to Marino, signalling to turn the lights back on. 

With Ramsay turning the music off, but leaving the water light panel on, he tells them that Cuba has a variety of delicious culinary masterpieces; each of them come from a different area… He gestures to the panel, and tells them that for today’s challenge, the chefs will break up into two pairs and work on making a dish that represents any of the following regions of Cuba… On the panel, a portion of the royal blue water turns to a sky blue; one much lighter than cerulean. Ramsay says the lighter shade of blue represents the seaside; La Costa. And when he thinks of La Costa, he thinks of seafood dishes with a delicious hint of citrus; something that gives the dish a brighter color. In her confessional, Allison states she’s aware of a lot of these different culinary atmospheres; making a Cuban dish could be a way to strengthen her international palette. Back on the panel, another portion of royal blue turns to a brickish red, with Ramsay telling them this next region represents Las Montañas, the mountains; which is a mainly earthy, rustic environment; smoked meats with roasted vegetables as a side dish. A third portion of royal blue turns to light green, and Ramsay tells the chefs that portion is supposed to be El Campo, which represents a homestyled level of cooking; slightly less rustic, but does have a nature that people call home. JC would state in his confessional that he’d be a master of working on El Campo if he were chosen to do it. Finally, there are small portions of gray, which Ramsay calls La Habana Urbana, which he describes as being bold, palettes elevated to be artistic, colorful, creative… And how each chef will be chosen to do which subject will depend on the color of raffle rods the sous chefs will hand out. Ramsay would state there are four rods for each subject (La Costa, El Campo, and Las Montañas; sky blue, green, and red, respectively), except for La Habana Urbana’s gray, where there are three; meaning one person from the Red Team will work solo, while the rest will work together. As everyone draws from the buckets each sous chef handed out, they’d find out what they’re gonna cook with. Ruben makes a confessional of how he’s got La Costa, and is gonna have to find something creative that’ll make Ramsay shit himself with excitement. The others continue to draw rods until there are none left, and when everyone finds out who they’re gonna work with, they are told by Ramsay to pair up with them immediately, depending on what color they had. He reminds them one last time that any region of Cuba they’ll work on depends on the color of rod they have onhand, and he tells them to get started… now!

\-----

With the luz verde activated, all the chefs ran straight to their respective kitchens, determination in their veins as they worked to make a culinary festivity for Ramsay to taste. JC would be amped up in his confessional, as he knows so much about the countryside. He and Freddie debated on what kind of dish they’d make, and what would go well El Campo-style. Being the expert of Cuban culinary arts, JC takes the helm of what they could do, suggesting to Freddie making a sausage dish that isn’t too spicy, to which Freddie makes a lighthearted joke about how he doesn’t want Ramsay’s mouth to burn another time. Freddie activated the stove to start the sausage dish they’ll be working with, as they begin thinking of what kinds of spices they could use for their sauce. Meanwhile, Samuel worked with Sierra on their La Habana Urbana-style dish, both wondering what goes well in a metro Cuban environment. In his confessional, Samuel says he’s no expert on Cuba, but he’s sure that whatever dish they make will be one to wow Ramsay. Both of them debate on making a steak kind of dish. Shaking on that idea, Samuel starts prepping the steak, while Sierra debates what kinds of sauces they could use, only to contradict herself, deciding that perhaps they could make a festive kind of environment with contrasting sauces on the same plate together. The only thing is they need to see what kinds of sauces they need to put on, as there could be plenty of options, but Sierra suggests to Samuel they don’t want to overdo it. With Edward and Dani, they seem to be in sync with what to make for their Las Montañas dish, debating what Cubans like to make up in the mountaintop regions. Edward says in his confessional that the mountains of Cuba are more inland than out, and that means there are more chances of them making meat… He suggests to Dani they make something using pork, because he’s more than aware that island nations have lots of pigs. Dani quips back that she hopes he isn’t talking about the ‘Bay of Pigs’, otherwise, they’d have to ‘invade it’. Edward awkwardly nodded at that, making Dani ask if that was too soon. Nevertheless, Dani began making their pork dish, while Edward had to wonder what kind of marinade would go well in it, with his partner suggesting they try to make it a bit sweet, in addition to the rustic tang they have to go for. They’d debate kinds of starchy vegetables to add to the sauce, just to give it an earthy taste, before eventually deciding on yucca. Tem and David were seen working on the La Costa dish, before they ultimately went for lobster. In his confessional, David expresses his confidence that he and Tem will get their dish up to par with the tropics of Cuba. Both he and Tem debated on the kind of twist they’ll work to make, before coming up with a garlic and lime butter, as well as adding a little salsa that can go well with it. They think of different fruits to pair it with, before going with mango, because fruits like them can balance the overall dish with their sweetness, and Tem says in her confessional that she’s never been a huge mango eater, but she’s confident that it’s definitely good to be used for anything, especially on savory foods. 

Over with the Red Team, they were working hard to give Ramsay the keys to a culinary masterpiece that would make all of Cuba proud. Over with Allison and Henri, they were working on a dish that screamed mountaintops. In her confessional, Allison says working with Henri is a bit on the nose, stating she knows a lot of ideas on what to cook, but if she can really teach an old dog new tricks, it’s gonna be something he’ll have to learn with her. She would be seen guiding Henri on how to cook their beefy dish, to which Henri responds he’s got no issue with it, thanking her. In his own confessional, Henri says Allison is a lovely young lady, but he’s tackled these high seas even when she was in diapers. Allison, meanwhile, was caramelizing onions for their mixture to decorate, insistent that their dish would suffice with them. Henri understood, stating it should have a good balance of sweet and rustic, and when Allison asks if cafe (or coffee) works well for their dish, Henri says perhaps a hint of it would go, because he doesn’t want any overwhelming flavors from Ramsay. Over with Ruben and Shayna, they were busy cooking the La Costa dish, and they collectively came up with a special octopus dish. The question was what kinds of spices or seasoning would they use for it. They ultimately decide to try a barbecue sauce with a hint of mango, with Shayna mentioning in her confessional that a few days ago, they had a challenge-winning dish that made the menu with mango, and states that perhaps they should replicate it a little. Additionally, Shayna suggests to Ruben they make a coconut rum that can mesh the flavors out, that way the barbecue won’t be too overpowering. Meanwhile, Kara and Isabela were working hard on their El Campo dish, as they debated what kinds of ingredients they’d use. They want to try making a chicken dish, but Kara wondered what could be more countryside-oriented, and Isabela says they could try a corncake base for the chicken. In her confessional, she states how her grandparents had made a similar recipe to the one she and Kara are making, and she wants to try and replicate it; but less corncake. The two ladies seemed confident that they’d get this recipe out in the running for wowing Chef Ramsay, making sure to put a special Cuban jerk marinade for the chicken. Over with Rio, he was working solo on the La Habana Cubana dish, and this meant that he was working double overtime to make sure that it would be a unique one. He states in his confessional that he had only learned about Cuban dishes for only less than a year, but he wants to make a niche twist to a classic kind. When Michelle asked him what he was cooking, Rio stated he was making a pork dish, but he wanted to give it a delicious spin that the streets of Cuba will love him for. 

Each chef continued to cook their dish with their partner, time dwindling as they kept working nonstop to try and complete it before Ramsay ordered them to plate. With Tem and David, they’re working well in tandem. However, David didn’t notice his lobster cooking a little longer than usual, though he states in his confessional, it’s all about taking risks and making sure they pay off well in the end. Meanwhile, Ruben got a taste of the sauce Shayna was about to baste, and when he gave her the thumbs up, she would glaze it on top. Elsewhere, Isabela and Kara were putting the finishing touches for their chicken dish. For giggles, they borrowed Rio to take a taste of their marinade to see if they needed to take anything out. After a little taste, Rio described it as just right; stating there’s not too much habanero they used in it, but just a niche blend between hot and spicy. Isabela tasted the marinade herself, and she thought it was a bit spicier, so she suggested to Kara they try to reduce the spice with lime juice. In her confessional, Isabela states that the acidity of lime juice can make the spiciness a bit more tolerable; she just had to try something like that. Over with JC and Freddie, they tasted the sauce of their spice, and Freddie started coughing a bit, asking JC how much spice they put in their dish, and in his confessional, JC is worried that he may have put too much spice for their sausage, stressing they cannot lose like this, given how limited time they have to make a new sauce. However, Freddie has a new idea on how to reduce the spice of the sauce a bit more; oranges. After squeezing an orange, he adds it into the sauce, states in his confessional that they seemed so close, he had to get something to simmer it down. Meanwhile, Samuel and Sierra were already plating their steak dish, and Sierra stated that this is as easy as the time she won her team the soccer championship when she was nine. 

Ramsay began the countdown, signifying the final few seconds of the challenge. Everyone raced to the pass to present their dishes, but Dani nearly slipped as she carried hers and Edward’s dish, only for Edward to catch her, his hands on her arms. After Dani thanked Edward for the help, they put their dish on the pass, with Dani wiping the sweat off her brow in her confessional, muttering how that would’ve been a disaster had she slipped. With all the chefs lining their dishes up, Ramsay would congratulate all of them for putting a solid effort into crafting their foods; no matter what portion of Cuba they’re representing, he’s sure that they’ll make people proud, including himself. However, Ramsay says that he won’t be judging this alone; joining him will be a chef-entrepreneur who’s made a major name of herself in Miami; the chef and owner of three different restaurants; Eileen Andrade. The young woman enters the dining room to the applause of the other chefs, and JC says in his confessional that he’s been to *Finka Table & Tap* a few times with his family; he also mentions he’s met Eileen before, but only for a hot ten seconds. Eileen would state it’s a pleasure, and she can’t wait to see how everyone’s takes on each culinary region of Cuba comes out. In her confessional, Kara expresses confidence in presenting their dish to Eileen, given how she’s a pretty strong force in the Miami culinary community. 

First up was La Costa, with Shayna/Ruben vs. Tem/David, and as the duo brought their dishes up, Ramsay and Eileen would first focus their attention on the Red Team’s dish, asking them what they’ve concocted. Ruben would describe their cooked octopus dish, complete with a little hint of mango barbecue drizzle and citrusy coconut rum on top. The judges would ask them what made them come up with the octopus inspiration, and Ruben, always quick to the punch, would state he knows octopus is a strong delicacy, especially in places like Latin America. Shayna would also back him up, stating that she’s cooked with Caribbean flavors in the past, and says that octopus is one of the more popular foods on her occasional menu item that gets ordered. Upon taking a bite, Ramsay and Eileen would note how properly cooked it was. However, Eileen says that when they had mentioned Caribbean flavors in it, she feels that the barbecue overwhelms the other tropical flavors in the octopus, and as such, she’s not sure if it’s *truly* La Costa-feeling. Ramsay agrees, pointedly asking the two if they’d gotten this octopus in the mountains of Cuba, as he can’t seem to taste any hint of fruit in it. Shayna would shake her head in her confessional, wondering how she didn’t taste the sauce before they dressed it. Turning their attention to Tem and David on the Blue Team, Ramsay asked them what they made. The two would describe their dish; grilled lobster with a garlic-lime butter, as well as mango-salsa complete with jalapenos and picked onions. Both judges seemed intrigued with the presentation of the meal, with Eileen stating that it sounds tropical enough, and while Ramsay agrees, he wants to know if it tastes as good as it sounds… However, upon making the cross-section, Ramsay wonders what the hell he’s cutting into… because it’s a bit tough and rubbery… Tasting it, Eileen compares the lobster’s texture to tasting a rubber tire, and that’s more than enough reason for Ramsay to declare it overcooked, and it’s especially a tragedy because the salsa was a lot more appetizing to stomach. David would rub his head in his confessional, cursing that he should’ve taken it off the grill sooner. Ramsay and Eileen were left with the decision of which duo deserved a point, between overcooked lobster and octopus with conflicting flavors. Eileen would apologize, and say that neither team deserves a point, even with the amount of effort they’ve made, she can’t say either La Costa dish is appealing. Ramsay would sigh in agreement, telling both duos to piss off. In his confessional, Ruben was a bit tense with the final decision, even uttering a “*La Costa my dick,*”

Hoping to clear their palettes, Ramsay called for the duos in charge of Las Montañas to come forward. First up was Edward and Dani, and Ramsay asked what kind of dish they had made. They presented their pork dish with a mojo complete with minced garlic, onion, and a little orange juice, with a hint of yucca. Along with it was a side of seasoned black beans cooked with rice. Judging by the smell, Eileen stated that it does hold a reminder of rural Cuba, with Ramsay agreeing. Wondering if it tastes as good as it does, they cut into the pork, and after a couple of bites, Eileen explains that the dish has this smoky taste with a little tang from the orange juice they had used, and it does bring a scape that could be found in the mountains. Ramsay agreed that the pork was cooked deliciously, and with a limited amount of time, they somehow managed to recreate a slow-roasted environment for the protein, putting the smoky texture intact. Hearing this, Dani and Edward high five each other, with Dani stating in her confessional that this had  better put them on the scoreboard. Next up were Allison and Henri, who presented their oxtail dish with garlic mojo, minced caramelized onions, and a side of seasoned rice and beans. Henri also adds that they put in a small blend of cafe into the marinade, stating that he and Allison wanted to give a sort of earthy texture. Eileen states that cafe is an important element when using it to make dishes inspired by the mountains, because it’s essentially homegrown; the kind of rural hospitality that gives each dish a splendid identity. Ramsay agrees to it, stating that judging by the smell of the dish, it seems like with the touch of coffee, it added more to this beef dish, but does wonder if it tastes as good as it smells. Upon taking bites into the dish, they found that it was delicious; Ramsay stated the oxtail was cooked beautifully, and with that addition of coffee, it enhanced the dish a bit, and each texture and flavor definitely brought out a mountainous vibe. Turning to Eileen, he asked which dish was the best one. However, Eileen says it’s a tough one; between the oxtail and the pork, they’re both strong contenders. Ramsay would agree with her, stating that it should be a great surprise that both teams have been awarded a point, making the score 1-1. In her confessional, Allison slightly disagrees with the judges, feeling that her and Henri’s dish was more Las Montañas than Dani and Edward’s, but it’s fine; they at least got a point. 

Next up was the El Campo part, and it was the battle between Isabela/Kara and JC/Freddie. Ramsay would ask Isabela and Kara what they made, and they’d tell him they went for a safe environment with a delicious pastel de choclo y pollo, a chicken dish with a corn cake base, complete with picked onions and peppers. Additionally, they’ve made it jerk chicken, where the marinade was a bit spicy, but less overpowering. The judges seemed intrigued by the presentation of the dish, noting how it’s a little tough to create such a dish like that, but the question is if it tastes good as it looks. Upon tasting a bite, they note how spicy it is, but Eileen asked what other ingredients they used for the sauce, to which Isabela states she used lime juice. Eileen compliments on how the acidity reduces the overall spicy tang in the sauce, and it makes the overall dish more worthy to eat. Ramsay agrees to it, also noting how delicious the corncake base was a surprise, but he can say it truly felt like he was eating in the countryside of Cuba. Freddie and JC were called up next to present their dish, and they would show their cuban sausage with a semi-spicy reduction sauce, and with a bit of orange mixed into their sauce. Eileen expresses her curiosity of orange used in the sauce, asking if they had their dish from the countryside, or even the shores. However, Ramsay does note how the presentation looks decent, but wonders if the dish is truly El Campo. The two judges took a bite from the sausage, and though JC was seen anxiously grimacing, Eileen stated that the dish was spicy, but the use of orange seemed to have taken off plenty of heat. Ramsay agreed, stating at first, he thought the semi-spicy reduction was spicy, but then he could feel the balance of sweetness and spice mixing together. Overall, the dish is very hearty; Eileen also added that she was afraid the dish would come off as more of a La Costa mixed with El Campo, but after tasting some of the spices in the mixture, it seemed a lot more El Campo, just more near the seashores, but at the same time, having an inland feel. Ultimately, they turn to each other, with Ramsay asking which dish she preferred. However, Eileen awkwardly chuckled in response, apologizing to Ramsay, but explaining both dishes reminded her of El Campo… She decides that both of them are worthy of a point, keeping both teams tied 2-2. In his confessional, JC is relieved to hear that his and Freddie’s dish managed to impress Eileen, while Kara makes her own one, stating that she needs to take plenty of lessons on how to be careful with making stuff spicy, but is thankful Isabela stepped in. 

The final portion was La Habana Urbana, calling for one duo from the Blue Team, as well as the soloist from the Red Team to come forward with their dishes. First turning to Sierra and Samuel, they would describe their dish; a stuffed plantain with ropa vieja steak, as well as a ‘graffiti drizzle’. When asked to describe their ‘graffiti dish’, Sierra would explain they’ve made it a bit contrasting in terms of colors; green being a cilantro-lime crema, sunset being a slightly spicy mango sauce with a hint of guava, red being a guajillo crema, and so on, so forth. Upon cutting into the dish, they’d find out that the steak was leathery tough to cut through, noting that it’s overcooked, much to Samuel and Sierra’s dismay, with the former stating in his confessional that he should’ve kept a better eye on it. Upon tasting it, however, Eileen would state that in spite of that, the dish itself is delicious. Ramsay would concur, but would say that had it not been the steak being overcooked, then it would’ve been a lot better, but they’ll have to see if it’ll fare best against the Red Team’s next dish. They’d turn their attention to Rio, who would present his deconstruction of a Cuban Sandwich; roasted pork with a rum-mustard caramel wrapped in ibérico ham, with garnishes of crisped brioche decked with garlic-butter, and melted quenelle streaks. Eileen would ask Rio what he was going for with this dish, and Rio would respond that he wanted to try a street vendor option, noting the nightlife of Havana, and though he’s never been to Cuba, he could imagine what places like there and Miami could offer as street food. Ramsay would notate how it almost looks like a tableside option to use for a potential service, stating how it looks pretty appetizing, but the question would be if it tastes as good as it looks. The two judges would cut into the meat, noting how beautifully cooked the pork looks, before each of them takes a bite. Eileen was the first to express her intrigue with the dish, stating that she could taste a little pickle acid in it, with Ramsay asking Rio if he used any pickle dusting for the dish, to which Rio confirmed, as well as a hint of plantain dusting. Eileen states to Rio that it’s important that pickle and mustard be used in Cuban sandwiches, as they push the acidity more than it already would’ve been. Ramsay says that the dish is pretty good… But is it worthy of receiving a point to break the tie…

And after careful deliberation between the two judges, they agree, earning Rio the third point. 

**3**\-2 (Red Team wins)

Rio was the first to celebrate, along with his teammates in back of him, as he would state in his confessional that even though he was never born in Cuba, he’s more than happy to show off his culinary attributes for the country. Eileen would clarify that the dish he concocted truly is a La Habana Urbana, stating it definitely sounds like a staple street food dish for samples, or to Ramsay’s case, tableside. As Rio reunited with his teammates, he was met with hugs from Kara and Isabela, with the latter stating in her confessional how happy she is that Rio won the challenge for them. Meanwhile, the Blue Team were living up to their namesake, being blue from learning they lost the challenge, with Sierra stating in her confessional that they win some, and they lose some, but she does know that there are some people who’re gonna have a day.

1ooro7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ooro7y/my_ex_and_i_broke_up_and_i_dont_know_where_to_go/,My ex and I broke up and I don't know where to go from here.,"I (M19) met my ex (20F) in June 2023. I got with her in November 2023 and she said “If I get with \[her\] I will have my feelings hurt”. For the first 3 months of the relationship everything was going well, we became very close very fast, we were intimate and affectionate. It was going well. I used to plan lots of things for us to do together. I took her places, we visited castles and all sorts of stuff. The relationship was the ideal “honeymoon period” of dating. When we used to have arguments I would stand my ground and she would back down because it was stupid (for example, I used to talk to a girl I worked with for a bit of fun to pass the time and my ex got mad when I told her I wasn’t into the girl… I wasn’t). 

After these first few months, it was her birthday and I took her on a nice trip and on the way home we had a large argument. I was staring into empty space on the train and some girls were sitting in my line of sight. One girl flashed her friends and I got up to go to the toilet. When I came back she was upset. I asked her why and she said it's because these girls said some really nasty stuff about me but wouldn’t tell me what it was. I got upset because she wouldn’t tell me and she got upset because I “didn’t understand the meaning of no” and that I could be mad at her if I wanted to be but she wouldn't tell me to “guard my feelings”. I got extremely upset at the train station and she said I “ruined” her birthday. When we got home she walked off in a fuss and didn't speak to me for days afterwards. When we finally spoke she gave me an ultimatum to either accept her meaning of no or we break up (essentially giving her a veto in the relationship). I stood my ground and said she is ridiculous and there has to be openness and honesty or this doesn’t work but I got threatened with a breakup so I caved. This is when I began to lose my assertiveness.

This dance would continue for some time. I would do something that I thought was perfectly fine, she would have a problem and cause an argument and I would just cave and let her win to keep the peace because she made me happy. I began to get incredibly stressed during this time and I lost my personality as I made it about her.

In March 2024 she broke up because she had enough of my passiveness. She wanted someone who could be assertive and “wear the pants”, a role which I had but slowly lost. The reason she gave for breaking up was just a compound of everything that had happened and what sent her over the edge was that I showed one of my friends her instagram account because he was curious what she was getting up to. This sent me into a deep sadness, not only because of this but my grandpa had died slightly earlier and I was really attracted to this girl - I didn’t want to lose her. I spent the rest of march trying to fix things and work things out and make it better but after talking to my friend he told me I would be better off not pursuing her and letting her come back once she realised she was being an idiot. Fast forward until June and I had pretty much gotten over her, I still messaged her frequently but I was feeling much better about myself and she ambushed me out of some exam I had to take. We spoke, I got on the train back with her and she was very apologetic and really upset about the way she had treated me. I was receptive but didn’t want to say anything because I wanted to see what happens. When I got off the train and went home we started talking and she was saying how “\[her\] thoughts are obsessed with \[me\]” and how “there hasn't been a day since we met that \[she hasn’t\] thought about \[me\[“. This reignited the emotions I felt for her and on that day I was hooked. We got back together soon after and laid some ground rules.

The EXACT same thing happened the second time around but much slower. I had her respect, admiration and I was assertive for a time and the same problems began to start but got worse. She saw me as lacking action and lacking urgency and we started to have small arguments again. I was getting very stressed at this time too but my love for her was more intense than these emotions. She didn’t take accountability, everything was her fault and when things didn’t go her way she would dangle the carrot of breaking up with me to “whip me” back into submission. On the surface she told me she wanted me to be assertive but if that assertion went against any of her plans, values or lifestyle it wasn’t allowed and I started to lose my personality again.

In October time we were applying to university and I pushed for us to go to the same school because I thought it would strengthen our relationship a lot to be together and experience university together. She wasn’t convinced at first but I managed to convince her after some time and everything was well. Our relationship got very strong during this time and I felt intense love for her bordering on limerence and I was overpresent and I filled most of my time with her.

Fast forward to March 2025 and this is where the main drama begins. She got rejected from my 1st choice university (A) and chose a different school whereas I still had to make my choice. I told her that I would go to her first choice university (B) so we could be together and share a house and have a wonderful time being together - I really really wanted this a lot, I wanted to marry her and have kids with her. She responded and said “don't do it, do  what makes you happy, I want you to be happy, don't come to uni with me, do what makes you happy” and I was struck with huge doubt in my relationship with her. I always viewed her as a very good person and very “great” and hearing that she had some indifference now damaged my view of how solid our relationship was. Everyday we would talk about it and everyday I would tell her that I was going to uni B and she would say “ok thats good” and we would do a dance, I would go home and talk to my friend and say “should I really do this, idk how I feel about this anymore” and I would get confused and upset. She told me during this time she was crying everyday for 3hrs+ and our relationship deteriorated. I had every intention to go to university with her and everyone in my life, and she was telling me otherwise. Everytime I tried to have a heart to heart with her about it and “tell her where my head was at” she would dismiss me and tell me to do what truly makes me happy and it's obvious I want uni A so I should go there. And every time I felt awful about it. This kept going on and on and on and on for months until May when she said “Firm B or we break up” and I firmed A on the spot because I was pissed off with her and I didn’t know what else to do.

For about a day I felt great and like I had a huge weight lifted off my shoulders and then the regret started to set in. I started to pine over her and stress about everything. I was upset and sad and it made the exams I had to do go worse than I expected (I didn’t know this at the time). A few weeks later, she blocked me but made a fake account to message me. She convinced me to start messaging her again and I did. She missed me, she wanted to figure things out, she loved me and wanted me to be happy. During the exams I messaged her a lot and I thought I was making progress, I drove her to the airport when she went on holiday and lent her my suitcase. She accidentally took my glasses too. When she was there she had an argument with me about me being weak and pathetic and we got over that and she really missed me on the phone so when we got back we had sex twice. I thought that she wanted to truly work things out with me. She acted like she was interested. After this I drove her to the beach and we had a great time (it was platonic, separate beds) but we did kiss and hold hands and enjoy each other's company (nothing sexual) and we got to talking but I was very nervous not to fuck anything up so I still had my silence about me. She messaged me the day after and said she couldn’t do it anymore and we needed to stop trying and it was over but I wasn’t convinced and the next few months I did everything I could to try and reignite some spark in the relationship.

I drove her to work everyday for a month, I bought her coffee and I took her places, I spent my birthday with her and we had a lot of fun messaging and just talking (we are really good friends). I made it VERY clear to her that if we were to remain friends it was because I was trying to pursue her and not because we wanted to be friends and she said ok.

I tried everything. I tried giving her weeks of space, I tried talking to her a lot, doing things for her, not doing things, being overly kind, being distant. No matter what I did it didn’t seem to do anything. All of this whilst being invited on trips with her, having dinner with her parents every Sunday (we didn't even do this when we were together) and being incredibly close with each other. All to no avail. I didn’t do anything here to be with her and I would’ve done it even if we were friends but a large part of me wants to be with her and I kept trying. I made it clear its what I wanted and she said “nono we are JUST friends” and then proceeded to act like we were together but in a platonic way.

There is a lot more here but that is the gist.

When we finally got our results, we both did worse than we expected. Probably due to the stress we both had about this, I barely missed the course I wanted and she had to choose a different course to go to the university she wanted. I offered to drive her as her Dad was going to pay me to do so and I really enjoy spending time with her. I told her 2 weeks before we were supposed to go exactly how I felt for her as 1 last ditch attempt to get her to feel anything and she went off at me and told me my thoughts should stay in my head, I ruined everything and a lot of other stuff including she didn't want me to take her to uni anymore.

The next day she messaged me, apologised, said she was confused and she rly wanted us to be friends and that I should take her to uni if I wanted to (It is important to note I was very very interested to take her to university so when she stopped me the day before I offered to take her free of charge to spend a little bit more time with her).

I took her to university and we had a great day. I went to my grandparents after and we spoke. I made plans with her. She cancelled on me at the last minute and as a last ditch (x2) I told her how I felt and she essentially said she can't do this anymore and we aren't going to message anymore. I was distraught.

This is where we are at. For the past 6 months I have been trying to get over a girl who wants NOTHING to do with me at all and I still love her. I know logically it's over but emotionally I feel I’m getting worse.

EXTRA INFO:

During this entire time she would insult me almost constantly, calling me weak and pathetic and a loser and that she deserves so much better than me. She can do no wrong in the relationship and everything was my fault. I lack assertion and all this other stuff. I accept all the blame for the way I acted about the university but she sees it as a huge betrayal and that I led her on. She sees it akin to cheating and her “trust” for me is gone, she doesn't admire me, respect me or anything anymore and has felt that way for months.

Since we broke up I have had limited contact with her, I wrote her a letter which she dismissed and sent me a HUGE wall of text about how I chose money over her and my morals are awful etc etc. I responded back telling her that I regret what happened and I have to live with that. I have to “feel” in the same way she has to “feel”.

I am fairly close with her parents and they have invited me over for dinner since we broke up where they told me that I deserve better than their daughter and that I have very good morals and goals for life and that I am a very smart, funny and good looking person and that I will find better in my life and whatever God wills, I will get.

She has a few mental things of her own that she needs to work through too.

There is a lot about her good and bad that makes our relationship look bad to the outsiders but many independent people use 70% her fault 30% my fault to look at our relationship as a whole. She was bad to me but I enabled it. She even blames me for her exam failures.

I feel led on and emotionally abused a little bit.

SINCE WE STOPPED TALKING:

I have started losing weight (I was quite overweight with her, I gained 22lbs with her) so I am trying to get back to a healthy weight. I am attending the gym too.

I have started to properly study to get back on my feet a bit.

I started a business with my dad.

I’m working longer hours at my job.

I have started seeing a fairly sympathetic therapist who tries to give me good advice here but also be realistic and I try to give a really unbiased view of our relationship to them because I want as realistic advice as possible.

I’m trying to take my mind off of her as best as I can.

WHY I’M MAKING THIS POST:

I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do or how I’m supposed to feel anymore. I know logically in my head it's over but in my heart it isn't and I would do whatever I have to do to make things right with her but I know it won't happen. My friends and family think I am cucked to her. I have days where I feel fine but others where I am hopelessly upset and I feel very very sad about it. I got drunk for the first time a few weeks ago and it just made me feel nothing about it. People have said time heals and makes you get over things but I do not feel like I am getting better. If I was to pursue this girl in the future (the low low chance she is even receptive) how do I even get to that point?

Essentially, I just want advice. I’m at a loss of what to do and it is affecting other parts of my life and the past 6 months have been the worst in my life.

If you want more info or anything feel free to comment, I won’t reveal everything but I can give you a more broad picture if you want.

TLDR: Broke up with my girlfriend of around 13months and left a rocky relationship. Instantly regretted it and tried to get back together with her with no success. The relationship wasn’t very good and yet I still want to be with her. I don’t know what to do to get myself back on the wagon after everything happened.",2,1762311539.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

So first off this is a new account I'll probably be using to post stuff like this so it is harder to trace back to me. I use my main username for way to many things, and I don't want this stuff dragging me down.

A little over a month ago I finally got my self a date, and it went well. The first date lasted 7 hours, and the second about the same. The 3rd one she came over and took my virginity. We continued to go on dates, and have sex at least once a week. 2 weeks ago I was pulled into a call with the council to make sure I knew it was only a physical relationship, and not to get attached or she might ruin me(she has BPD)

I thought things were going quite well aleast till last Sunday. She had a headache, but still wanted to come by and have some fun. She seamed a bit off, and withdrawn. She seamed to be enjoying things, but just wasn't into it as much as she normally was. I dropped her off at her place after getting some food with her. I figured she was just having a bad night. We've been chatting daily since(also thought it was going well)

I just got dumped over a discord call 30 minutes ago. Her main reason for doing so was my poor communication skills(both regular conversation, and dirty talk), and my difficulty interpreting body language. Apparently it felt like she was talking to a brick wall, and truthfully he hasn't really felt engaged in person for the last week(but she has had stints like this previously and blamed her BPD), so I didn't think much of it.

I just wish she brought up her concerns when they were fresh, and maybe we could have work through it

If anything I'm glad it happened now. while I liked her and wanted to keep being with her(truthfully I was gonna ask her out for coffee tomorrow, and ask if she was willing to take us serious), at least it happened before I became to emotional attached. 

The real gut punch is that she's the only person I've ever emotional connected with(excluding family), and opened up to about thing more then anyone else I'm my life(sad isn't it).

Shes always gonna be my first relationship, first intimate partner, and first time I've felt like I was capable of being in a relationship. While she felt I was an emotionless brick wall, I felt like I was talking to someone who cared about me, actually me.

I guess the ADHD interpersonal skills, and my messed up relationship with my emotions finally caught up to me. I think I'm gonna find my self a therapist, and start working on unpacking that mess.

I really just needed to write things down, vent about it, and sort my emotions. I knew it was never gonna long term, or end well(one or the other), at least it was fun while it lasted, and I've learned a lot about my self through the experience.

P.S. for a more on topic note Im working in using register level programing on an Arduino to work with SPI for a class, and man I sucks. I2C is so much easier.",2,1762311408.0,ADHD_Programmers,1,0.75,False

💫 Personality

Shi is calm and composed, always smiling — whether angry, sad, or even asleep. Her eerie smile makes her both elegant and terrifying to others. She’s wise, manipulative, and mysterious, often walking with graceful pose. Despite her calm nature, she possesses immense demonic power. She’s excellent at designing clothes, skilled in cooking, and surprisingly flexible. Shi loves red roses, which she keeps close in her shop.She dislikes anyone pulling her hair, prefers unique and decent clothing, and often appears at night. Despite her might, she has a weakness to steel, a rare flaw for her demon kind.

🍴 Food & Drinks

Water, blood, coffee, humans, apples, cherries, pineapples, egg salad, Gyotaku steak, rice, strawberry cake, sausage, pancakes, peanuts, toast, ramen noodles

⚔️ Powers

Gruesome Punch – A destructive strike that shatters anything instantly and can even kill on impact, negating regeneration or energy recovery.
Enhanced Speed – Shi can move with extreme quickness, dodging attacks flawlessly. Her speed increases even further after each dodge.
Blood Consume Strength – After slashing an enemy, Shi absorbs their blood, greatly amplifying her strength.
Mind Read – She can read minds, predicting attacks and movements before they happen.
Sleep Touch – A single touch can put opponents into a 59-hour deep sleep, leaving them defenseless. She can cancel this effect at will.
Teleportation Garage – With a snap of her fingers, Shi can teleport herself, others, or even objects faster than light itself.
Infinite Regeneration – She can completely restore her body at will. Her regeneration surpasses immortality itself.
Black Claws Void Destruction (Special Move) – Shi multiplies into countless illusions and slashes with her dark claws, erasing anything they touch. The attack also brings forth the opponent’s deepest fears and unending pain until death.

💞 Relationships

Ara – Great relationship. Shi sees Ara as a sweet but overly soft girl. Despite finding her gentle nature odd, Shi respects her deeply and treats her like family.
Tomo – Good relationship. She finds Tomo powerful but is disgusted by his blood-based abilities. Still, she treats him kindly, almost like a son she never had.
Farris – Good friendship. Shi teases Farris often for trying to act strong but likes his company. Occasionally gifts him clothes as a sign of friendship.
Rayku – Neutral relationship. She acknowledges Rayku’s skill but dislikes his mission of slaying demons. Though she once tried to kill him, she still treats him with unsettling kindness.

🩸 Summary Overview

Shi Koshaiya is a legendary anti-villain in Ara the Sea Demon, known as The Demon Queen Fox of Grace Flowers. She stands among the highest-ranking demons, feared and revered by both humans and demons alike. Her permanent, graceful smile hides a dark past — one tied to her mother’s attempt to teach her calmness and restraint. This training led Shi to develop her eternal smile, symbolizing serenity yet concealing unimaginable power.
As she grew, her strength evolved beyond the limits of her tribe, making her a near-mythical being. To demons, she’s a nightmare that cannot be challenged; to humans, she’s a haunting legend of beauty and death. Shi represents the perfect blend of love, sorrow, and darkness, forever smiling through the eternal night that surrounds her.

From med school dreams to data science reality, swapped stethoscopes for spreadsheets and now I help healthcare professionals from behind the algorithms.
Fit enough to crush a morning run (outrunning bad vibes is my cardio), but I know the best connections happen when you actually stay put for a great conversation.

- Fitness enthusiast who believes in both physical and mental workouts
- Video game strategist with a soft spot for pixelated heroism
Someone who takes their coffee strong and their debates stronger

Looking for: A like-minded friend who appreciates the beauty in both a well-crafted equation and a well-timed joke. Bonus points if you can keep up with fitness goals, enjoy thoughtful banter, and don't mind the occasional gaming marathon.

Perfect first hangout: Morning run followed by coffee and conversation that makes us lose track of time, or exploring something new while debating whether data or art better explains the universe.

I average about 29km per run (878km ran in the past 6 months on Strava).

I also get very wet from sweat.

My concern is mostly with the risk of hypothermia or and that being cold and wet sucks.

To be safe, I figured I’d throw an emergency thermal blanket and use hand warmers on colder days. 



Other things I’m thinking:

I need multiple pairs of gloves/balaclavas because after 10-20 km the first set is soaked. Does anyone carry multiple sets for that reason?

I may need to loop longer runs at home so I can change into warm dry clothes if I can’t figure out the cold/wet problem.

I currently run in Hoka Bondi 9 (4E/x-wide) shoes. Does anyone have a trail shoe recommendation that is similar in width and cushioning?

Nutrition/fuel is way more important. Food = warmth + energy. Consider thermos with chicken noodle soup or coffee?

We're still about it. Sorting ourselves out. While my wife and I have been there together, and I've been to Chiang Mai maybe 5x since 2009, we never looked at it as a place to live until this year.

With that in mind, and given that I have to fly to Shanghai for business anyways, I'm going to spend 16 days in town beginning in December. I plan to talk to some real estate agents, visit a few schools and preschools, meet a nanny agency perhaps. I think it's really important to walk a few of these nice homes I'm seeing online and actually get a feel for the moobans, etc. Does anyone have any specific recommendations for agents and pro tips for toddler-parents that I should get a feel for while I'm visiting?

Does anyone have any specific locations that I should really check out for family life, neighborhoods I should see a few houses in and check the surrounds?

They also already have a billion blankets and I need it to be good for both the dad and the mom.

1oorbba,https://i.redd.it/0g2k0tsxpczf1.jpeg,Low Carb Apple Frangipane Cake,"In looking for a good low carb apple cake, I stumbled across this beauty. One of my favorite tarts is a poached pear and frangipane tart, which I would need to modify in order to make it low carb. Naturally, I was drawn to this cake because of its title.

I made the cake without an outer crust, hence me calling it more of a cake and not a tart. It’s basically kind of an almond flour apple coffee cake, which I’m here for! The cake is moist and flavorful, but it is a little crumbly. Luckily, it isn’t stodgy and the chopped walnuts add a wonderful flavor and crunch, so it works just fine as a dessert or snack with a nice cup of coffee. It isn’t quite the flavor or texture of my OG frangipane tart, but it’ll do as a low carb substitute.


Just a couple of notes about the recipe: 

First, I doubled the amount of apples used and placed thinly sliced apples on the top. I might do this next time, but it would work much better as an upside down cake in order to help the fruit not dry out.

Second, the author calls for apple extract in order to ramp up the apple flavor and keep the carb content low. I didn’t have apple extract and didn’t mind using 2 smallish apples. I figure that spreading 2 apples out over 9 servings still makes the carb content pretty negligible, especially since I used allulose as the sweetener. I also swapped out the apple extract for almond extract to give it more of the frangipane flavor. I’m sure it’ll be great either way.

I used a brownie pan lined with parchment. The recipe fits perfectly, and the cake holds together enough to transfer and individually wrap pieces for either fridge or freezer storage. I’m sure that the suggested round pan would be even prettier for serving.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_Tunnel?wprov=sfti1#) / [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273253/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) / Our Collection

Ok, I don’t mean to over-blow that post title but really - ((nods head)) - this is largely a story of how I came to be in possession of a CD Projects “Hard Case” Metal, Flip-Top Compact Disc Case - the metal, flip-top 24-disc storage solution known colloquially as:

**-The Box-**

The *very same Box* that I run 90%+ of our television programming out of. ((Looks around bumptiously)) Around here, it’s basically like holding the **Keys to the Kingdom**.

Just saying, it’s kind of a *big* deal.

+

From IMDb: Josh has an offer to ""go perm"" at his employer and the first task is to mail 17 high priority letters....something that seems a little difficult to do.

+

What’s that got to do with the price of java down at Blue Bottle Coffee? Quite a lot, actually.

Mrs. Lady Zedd and I were living in Sacramento at the time and had recently grabbed *Haiku Tunnel* from a bottom shelf of our local Blockbuster Video. The week before, she’d grabbed another little out of the way feature film - *The Royal Tenebaums* - from the same spot and we were beginning to think this little unfashionable, dust-laden corner was magic. It sure coughed up movies we enjoyed, for *true*.

The film came at a critical juncture… my few years of being a stay-at-home dad was coming to a close as our daughter, Little Miss Zedd, was coming into school-age. It was time for yours truly to *re-enter* the workforce but I was having trouble coming up with a suitable plan of action. Enter the Kornbluths - Josh and Jacob - and their sharp, intelligently sardonic film, *Haiku Tunnel*.

In the story, the fictional character “Josh”, living in the mythical city of “San Franclisco” works as a temporary legal secretary, where he tries very hard to have no long-term, meaningful connection to *anything* and enjoys many fine misadventures.

“Temping,” I thought, “now that might be an interesting way to jump start my career.” If you’ve ever been off work, even just over a week’s vacation, you know how difficult it can be to get back up to speed. After a few years off, taking care of our daughter, I figured temping might make the reconditioning of work hardening easier.

Here’s where **The Box** comes into the story - assuming I’d be sent all over the Sacramento area, I wanted a sturdy metal case to keep my discs safe and sound. Because it’s me - my first assignment was also my last… *just like the movie*, I wound up going “perm”. Turned out, I didn’t need The Box after all… or the new car I bought (the office was directly across the street).

((Blink-blink))

Other movie / life bleed over? During my tenure in Sacramento, I was shown to an enormous pile of backlogged work. Here’s the kicker - there wasn’t room for me in the department, so I was given a cubicle in a neighboring department. The next day, my supervisor was transferred to a different office and the incoming supervisor wasn’t told I existed. For months, I just kept showing up but I was essentially a *lost* employee. Nobody was looking over my shoulder, nobody asked me who I was, and I just listened to my music and processed the years long backlog.

See - I had found my own, disconnected *Haiku Tunnel*. I was a leaf, floating in the wind and I loved it at first but ((shrug)) over time, I got lonely. Days bled together, became weeks, weeks became months. The gig was up when I cleared the workload and one of the supervisors went looking to see where they went.

Not long after that, Mrs. Lady Zedd took a job in San Francisco and I transferred to our offices there - *just like in the movie* - I found myself suddenly working as a legal secretary (as much as I said I never would). *Haiku Tunnel* had proven a great primer for the stresses and strains of that profession. 

Finding myself overwhelmed, I took the advice offered Josh by his attorney “Bob”… I needed to go to my desk, settle down - FOCUS - and catch up! Oh, I took MLZ’s advice too… *never cry at your desk*.

The film’s humble earnings shouldn’t be taken as a negative - as a modest indie film of that time, it wasn’t a studio darling but I can tell you true, we found the story more enjoyable, more *real* than the standard big budget flicks that clog the suburban multiplexes. It may not be a name you recognize, but *Haiku Tunnel* has had an oversized impact on my life - whether it was intentional (me using it as job inspiration) or by irony (that temp job turning *perm* and then leading to a San Francisco law office).

What’s left to say - I’ll just take my CD Projects “Hard Case” Metal, Flip-Top Compact Disc Case, pull *Twin Peaks* out and settle into tonight’s exciting episode. Mrs. Lady Zedd says she looks over to The Box often, sitting up by the 4K player, and thinks about that time: when new adventures could be found on the bottom shelves of your local Blockbusters - it was a different time but the *movie on* here is just the same.

Movie on.

1oorad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1oorad1/the_polishing_of_ghosts/,The Polishing of Ghosts,"My name is Subhash Das. For eleven years, I have been the senior custodian for the H**ton Psychiatric Suites on the seventh floor. A fancy name. It means I clean up after people’s minds have spilled. I arrive at six in the evening, when the doctors and their ghosts have gone home. My work is a quiet one. I believe a clean space makes for a clear mind, even if I am only cleaning the space and not the mind itself.

Dr. Anjali Sharma’s office, Suite 7B, was always my last stop and my favorite. She was a woman of order. Her desk was a landscape of precision: pens aligned like soldiers, patient files stacked with geometric perfection, a single, elegant brass lamp that cast a warm, steady light. Even the air in her room felt… settled. I would dust her shelves of thick books—Freud, Jung, Laing—and feel a kind of peace. I respected her. She was young, but she had an old soul’s stillness. She would sometimes still be there when I arrived, finishing her notes. She always greeted me by name. ""Good evening, Mr. Das. Thank you."" Not many do.

The change began in October, the month of shifting light. It started not with a bang, but with a smudge. A single, greasy fingerprint on the glass of her framed university degree. Dr. Sharma did not leave smudges. I polished it away, but it was like finding a crack in a perfect vase. A small thing, but it lets you know the whole structure is compromised.

The next week, it was a teacup, half-full of cold, jasmine-scented water, left on a bookshelf where a teacup did not belong. Beside it, a single marigold, its petals already starting to curl and brown. I threw the flower away and washed the cup, but the wrongness of it stayed with me. It was a disturbance in the room’s grammar.

I saw the man who must have been the cause. I only saw him in the waiting area, as my shift began and his session was ending. He was not remarkable. Not tall, not short. Not handsome, not ugly. He had the kind of face you would forget immediately, except for his eyes. They were completely still. When I emptied the wastebasket near the reception desk, he was watching me. Not with curiosity. Not with judgment. It was the way a scientist might watch a microbe under a lens. It made the hairs on my arms stand up. I nodded, a small gesture of courtesy. He did not react. When he left, the air in the waiting room seemed to thin, to grow colder.

After that, Dr. Sharma’s room began to reflect a new kind of chaos. Subtle, at first. A pen left uncapped. A file put back on the shelf upside down. These are the details a cleaner notices. We are students of human entropy. But then it grew. One evening, I found a stack of her notes had been knocked to the floor. Papers were scattered under her desk like fallen leaves. She was a woman who would have knelt immediately to put them in order. But they were left there, for me to find. As I gathered them, my eyes fell on a few lines she had scrawled on a notepad. *He is not the patient. I am the experiment.*

I pretended I had not seen it. My job is to erase the traces of the day, not to read them. But the words were like a burr, caught in the fabric of my thoughts.

My wife, Sarita, her lungs are not good. The doctor says it is fibrosis. I listen to her breathe at night, a shallow, rattling sound, like paper tearing. I know what it is to watch someone you care for become fragile, to see the container of their body start to fail. I started to see the same fragility in Dr. Sharma. Her crisp, professional posture began to slump. Dark circles, the color of old bruises, appeared under her eyes. One evening, she was on the phone as I began my rounds in the hallway. I could not help but overhear. Her voice was sharp with a sound I recognized: the edge of panic.

""No, Sameer, I am not 'just tired'!"" she whispered, her voice tight. ""You don't understand. It feels like… it feels like my thoughts are not my own. When I close my eyes…"" She stopped. I moved away, pushing my cart, the squeak of the wheels suddenly too loud. It is not my place to hear these things. But I heard them.

The patient, the unremarkable man, I learned his name was simply ""K"" from the sign-out sheet. K. A letter. An unknown variable. After his Tuesday sessions, the office was always worse. One Tuesday, I found a small, perfect pyramid of sugar cubes on her patient couch. Another time, the window was wide open, November cold pouring into the room, scattering papers. On her desk, a single sentence was written on her blotter, pressed so hard the ink had bled through. *The hands remember what the mind forgets.*

I began to worry. Not as an employee, but as a man. I have a daughter who is a teacher. Bright, capable, like Dr. Sharma. I see the world’s darkness and I want to shield them from it. But how do you shield someone from a ghost you can’t see?

The worst night was a Tuesday in late November. The clinic was empty. The silence was heavier than usual. As I approached Suite 7B, I saw the light was still on, a sliver under the door. I expected to find her working late. I knocked gently. ""Dr. Sharma? It is Subhash Das.""

No answer.

I waited. The protocol is clear: if a doctor is in, I come back later. But something felt wrong. I pushed the door open a few inches.

The room was bathed in the warm light of her brass lamp. Dr. Sharma was sitting in her chair, facing the window, her back to me. She was perfectly still. I thought she might be asleep.

""Doctor?"" I said, my voice softer this time.

She did not turn. She was just sitting there, staring out at the city lights, a constellation of distant fires. The room was immaculate. The pens were aligned. The books were straight. It was the most ordered I had ever seen it, more perfect than even her usual perfection. It was a sterile, breathless order. An order achieved after a great and terrible storm.

And then I saw it. On the polished surface of her mahogany desk, her hands were resting, palms up. And she was staring at them. She stared at her own hands with an expression of such profound, desolate horror, it was as if she had discovered two venomous spiders nesting in her lap. Her mouth was slightly open, and I could see, even from the doorway, that she was trembling, a fine, high-frequency vibration that seemed to run through her entire body.

I did not know what to do. To speak would be to break something. To leave felt like abandonment. For a long moment, we were frozen in that tableau: the doctor staring at her alien hands, and the cleaner, the invisible man, watching from the threshold. I saw in her face the look of someone who has stared into the abyss and seen their own reflection.

Quietly, I pulled the door until it was almost closed, leaving only a crack. I took my cart and went to the far end of the hallway, to the lounge, and began cleaning there. I made more noise than usual, humming an old film song my wife likes, running the buffer, creating a wall of ordinary sound to protect her. I was standing guard, in my own way. I was polishing the floors while she tried to polish a ghost from her soul.

An hour later, I saw her leave. She did not look at me. She walked like a woman made of glass, afraid a single misstep would shatter her.

The next week, her office was empty. Her name was gone from the door. A new doctor’s name was there, on a temporary plaque. I was told Dr. Sharma had taken an indefinite leave of absence. For her health.

Tonight, I cleaned Suite 7B. It belongs to a Dr. Matthews now. He leaves coffee rings on his desk and drops paper clips on the floor. He is a man of ordinary messes. As I was emptying Dr. Sharma’s—Dr. Matthews’—wastebasket, I found a small, personal card addressed to me. *Mr. Das, Thank you for your quiet diligence. It did not go unnoticed. Anjali Sharma.* Tucked inside was a crisp five-thousand-rupee note.

I am sitting in the empty lounge now, the clinic silent around me. I am holding her note. I will give the money to Sarita, for a new shawl. It is good money. But my heart is heavy. I think of that man, K, with his still eyes, and of Dr. Sharma, with her capable hands that became a source of terror. I do not understand what happened in that room. It is not my place to understand. My job is to clean what is left behind. But some messes cannot be wiped away. Some messes become part of the room itself, part of the memory of the walls. Tonight, as I polish the floors of Suite 7B, I know I am not just polishing wood and tile. I am polishing the space where a good woman fought a war, and I do not know if she won.",2,1762310434.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1oor7z5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oor7z5,Dune Weaver Mini Pro — Build the perfect holiday present ✨,"**TL;DR:** Printable kinetic sand table, IKEA bowl base, \~$100-$150 total cost, open source software with tons of features, 1,500+ member Discord community. Free versions available on Makerworld to try first.

Hey everyone, I'm Tuan, maker of the Dune Weaver sand table. After months of refinement, I'm finally releasing the Mini Pro—and I genuinely think this is one of the most captivating things you can 3D print.

**What is it?** A kinetic sand table that traces hypnotic patterns in fine sand using a hidden magnet. You may have seen one in the wild before, but this one you build, instead of buying! Once you set it up, it becomes one of those things people just stare at—whether it's running in the background during a video call or sitting on your coffee table.

**A gift in three ways 🎁**

* Gift yourself the experience of building
* An ultimate gift for a loved one
* Gift the 3D printed parts + instructions

**What drove the Mini Pro design:**

I wanted this version to nail a few key things:

* **Printability first** – If it could be 3D printed, it should be. No relying on specialty hardware like timing belts or linear rails when a clever printed solution works better.
* **Use what's already out there** – Building around an IKEA BLANDA bowl means you're not hunting down obscure parts or spending a fortune on custom components.
* **Pass the living room test** – If it looks like a science experiment, it's staying in the garage.
* **Keep the cost reasonable** – Commercial options start at $130, use cheap motors, and go way up from there. This whole build comes in around $100-$150 (Cheaper if you have a lot of parts on hand or build in bulk).
* **Silence is golden** – Spent a lot of iteration on making this whisper-quiet. If you build the NEMA 17 version, you won't even know that it's running.
* **Build on what worked** – Took everything I learned from previous Dune Weavers and refined the mechanics, electronics integration, and added tons of software features.

**The Software (Open Source & Feature-Packed):** I've poured hundreds of hours into the software:

* Brand new UI for intuitive pattern browsing and control
* Integrated LED control – No separate ESP32 for WLED needed, LEDs controlled directly
* Still Sands – Scheduled downtime so it automatically rests when you want peace
* Auto-play on boot – Set it and forget it
* Home Assistant integration for smart home enthusiasts
* Network profiles & Wi-Fi hotspot mode for easy setup anywhere
* Extensive pattern library that the community keeps expanding

All software is completely open source and actively developed!

**Two build paths available:**

* Modern: NEMA 17 steppers with DLC32 or ESP32 board running FluidNC firmware
* Classic: 28BYJ-48 steppers with DWP electronics for a familiar build (coming soon)

**The experience:** This isn't just a print-and-forget project. It becomes a presence in your space. People stop by your desk at work asking about it. Kids are transfixed. You'll find yourself spacing out while watching new patterns emerge. It's genuinely meditative—and makes an unforgettable gift.

**Why build instead of buying?**

When you build the Dune Weaver Mini Pro, you get the satisfaction of creating something with your own hands, you understand exactly how it works (so you can fix or modify anything), and you're building on an open platform that you truly own. No cloud dependencies, no subscription fees, no planned obsolescence. Plus, the build itself is genuinely enjoyable—there's something special about watching it come to life piece by piece.

**What you get:**

* 🖨️ Print-ready STL files & 3MF
* 📋 Complete BOM with sourcing links
* 🛠️ Step-by-step assembly guide (hardware → wiring → software)
* 💬 Access to our 1,500+ member Discord community – The Discord is buzzing with builders sharing custom patterns, troubleshooting tips, creative mods, and new features. You're not just getting files—you're joining makers who are pushing this platform forward together.

**Common questions:**

*""Do I need advanced electronics knowledge?""* Nope. If you can wire up basic components and follow a diagram, you're good to go.

*""Is the Raspberry Pi hard to set up?""* Not at all—the detailed guide walks you through everything step by step, from flashing the SD card to getting your first pattern running.

*""What if I get stuck during the build?""* The 1,500+ member Discord community is incredibly helpful and responsive. Most questions get answered within minutes.

*""Can I customize it later?""* Absolutely! The open source software means you can tweak anything, and the community is constantly creating new patterns and mods.

**Want something bigger or free?**

* Looking for a larger table? Check out the full-size DWP (also available on Patreon)
* Want to try before you buy? I have 2 free tables on Makerworld: the original Dune Weaver (OG) and the Dune Weaver Mini

Perfect timing if you want to build something truly special before the holidays—and actually have something impressive to show for all that printer runtime 😅

## Why a Thoughtful Gift Beats a Pricey One Every Time

In a world of instant gratification, a thoughtful gift is a powerful statement. It says you spent time considering what would make someone happy. The best **christmas gifts** aren't always the most expensive; they are the most personal. A well-chosen gift strengthens a connection, creates a lasting memory, and shows a level of care that a generic gift card simply can't replicate. This year, let's aim for impact, not just impulse.

## How to Brainstorm the Perfect Christmas Gift Idea

Before you even open a browser, channel your inner detective. The best ideas are often hidden in plain sight.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts)

1.  **Listen for Hints:** In the months leading up to Christmas, people drop hints without even realizing it. ""My old headphones are crackling,"" ""I'd love to learn how to make pasta,"" or ""I'm so stressed lately."" Keep a note on your phone and jot these down.
2.  **Analyze Their Hobbies:** What do they do for fun? The avid gardener, the weekend gamer, the aspiring chef, the fitness fanatic—each hobby is a goldmine for specific, useful, and appreciated gifts.
3.  **Identify a Problem:** Can you solve a small, everyday annoyance for them? Do they always lose their keys? Are their coffee mugs perpetually lukewarm? A gift that solves a problem is a gift that keeps on giving.
4.  **Think in Experiences:** Sometimes the best gift isn't a *thing* at all. Concert tickets, a cooking class, a weekend getaway, or a spa day creates a memory that lasts far longer than a physical object.

I think its been about 3 months since i've ended things with my ex. I would be lying if I said it didn't hurt to end it the way that it did, especially when I had the best memories with her compared to my first. I've been in a rut, not feeling like myself and lost interest in things. I've been trying to fix myself by going out again and spending some time with friends and family. But the pain comes back at the end of the day whenever I have to shut the lights and all memories comes rushing in. I can't keep going like this and as much as I want to forget her, I just can't. Her leaving my life like that left a hole in my chest and I don't know anyone who can fill that hole. Dating isn't easy, like how you do try to start an intimate relationship again. I guess i've been pretty lucky with the past two. Just trying my luck here I guess and hope that I meet someone. I'm not in rush to go to in serious relationship,  we can take some time to know each other. I just want to feel that feeling of having a special someone again. And i'm hoping that I could finally let go and do things right this time.

In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I was in a room I had never seen before, or had I?

It didn’t look recognizable, though I couldn’t remember anything. My mind was a complete blank slate. 

I wandered through narrow corridors. 

After about twenty minutes, I had found an exit hatch half buried in debris. 

I climbed out to sunlight that didn’t feel real.

The town was gone.

Buildings collapsed, streets melted. 

Cars twisted into rusted sculptures. 

Decomposing bones lay where people once stood.

The mountains smoked on the horizon.

I walked for hours, calling Laurie’s name, until I reached our house.

Inside, everything was ash or rot. 

Her side of the bed was empty.

I sat on the couch and cried until I couldn’t breathe.

When I looked up, the television was sitting on the coffee table, still intact.

Next to it lay the same history book from my classroom, open to the page about the Horsemen.

I read the line twice, tracing it with a shaking finger

“They appear as warning before great destruction before humanity’s own undoing.”

Then it all came back to me. 

The crash, the horseman, everything. 

I read over that passage again, then stared at the tv. 

I remembered the news reports. “Russians”, “War”, “Nuclear Bombs”. 

Outside, the wind picked up, carrying the sound of hoofbeats.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I was in a room I had never seen before, or had I?

It didn’t look recognizable, though I couldn’t remember anything. My mind was a complete blank slate. 

I wandered through narrow corridors. 

After about twenty minutes, I had found an exit hatch half buried in debris. 

I climbed out to sunlight that didn’t feel real.

The town was gone.

Buildings collapsed, streets melted. 

Cars twisted into rusted sculptures. 

Decomposing bones lay where people once stood.

The mountains smoked on the horizon.

I walked for hours, calling Laurie’s name, until I reached our house.

Inside, everything was ash or rot. 

Her side of the bed was empty.

I sat on the couch and cried until I couldn’t breathe.

When I looked up, the television was sitting on the coffee table, still intact.

Next to it lay the same history book from my classroom, open to the page about the Horsemen.

I read the line twice, tracing it with a shaking finger

“They appear as warning before great destruction before humanity’s own undoing.”

Then it all came back to me. 

The crash, the horseman, everything. 

I read over that passage again, then stared at the tv. 

I remembered the news reports. “Russians”, “War”, “Nuclear Bombs”. 

Outside, the wind picked up, carrying the sound of hoofbeats.

In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

My day job requires a lot of context switching, so by the time evening hits, I’m mentally drained.

I usually hit the gym in the evening to reset before sitting down to work on my business, but I often end up feeling foggy and struggling to focus.

I’m sensitive to caffeine, so stopped coffee and energy drinks. Lately, I’ve been drinking kombucha (since it has a bit of tea), which helps a little — but not much. I see others taking focus or nootropic supplements and wonder if they actually help.

Has anyone here tried supplements for focus? Or do you have any non-caffeine hacks or home remedies that help you stay sharp and productive after a long day?",1,1762309910.0,EntrepreneurCanada,0,1.0,False

1oor2bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oor2bt/wife_lost_it_on_me_after_family_dinner_and_things/,Wife lost it on me after family dinner and things got physical,"My wife of three years completely lost her mind after we got back from my brother's place tonight. The whole thing started because my brother and I were looking through his old photo albums and cracking up about the ridiculous haircuts everyone had in the 90s. My wife's mom was in a few of the pictures (they grew up in the same town), and my brother made some joke about how everyone had those giant permed bangs back then. I chuckled. That was it. Nothing mean-spirited at all.

Cut to later when we're back at our apartment. She suddenly mutes the TV show we were watching and starts going off about my relationship with my brother. How it's weird that we text each other funny memes. How it's suspicious that I don't fight with my family like she does with hers. She kept saying my family is ""too nice"" and it makes her uncomfortable.

So I'm sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone, trying to decompress from the day. She starts up again about something completely random I apparently did wrong last week. I'm barely paying attention at this point. So I did what seemed smart and just stayed quiet, let her get it all out without adding fuel to the fire. Huge mistake.

I glanced back down at my phone for maybe five seconds. Next thing I know, she's on me. Three solid punches landed before I even processed what was happening. I stood up fast to get some distance, and she slapped me hard enough that my ears rang. Then she runs to the apartment door, throws it open, and plants herself in the doorway screaming at me to stay away from her while literally blocking my only way out.

I'm standing there in my gym shorts trying to find my phone that slid under the coffee table. She's yelling loud enough for the entire floor to hear, making it sound like I'm the one doing something to her.

Right now I'm sitting in my car in the parking garage wearing gym shorts and a t-shirt with a split lip, and I figured I'd ask you guys what the hell I'm supposed to do here.",98,1762309811.0,Advice,127,0.95,False

1oor20g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/1oor20g/is_there_a_balancing_test_to_determine_when/,Is there  a “balancing test” to determine when  professional boundaries are unprofessional,"
My students aren’t my friends, but I maintain the same type of professional relationship with them as other teachers do — one that includes clear boundaries. The challenge is that there isn’t a well-defined balancing test that objectively separates professionalism from personal connection. Much of what’s discussed on Reddit only provides implicit or informal examples of what’s considered acceptable or not. I am thinking of becoming a principal and am trying to take on some more responsibilities to help younger staff members. 

As for professional standards, is the Ontario College ofTeachers (OCT) document legally binding? , since it outlines the official Standards of Practice and Professional Boundaries expected of certified educators. I printed a poster put the OCT poster and put it in the classroom to that I can have a professional relationship while maintaining a close enough relationship to maintain order and morale in the classroom. 

Can any other teachers confidently say that these are the main boundaries. I think the  term “teacher but not friends” is very socially constructed and could mean very different things for different ages, backgrounds, and geographical background, Ontario is very diverse. I don’t want teachers to avoid making a “a close professional relationship” since they are too afraid of getting into trouble or get into legal  action because they don’t have a clear idea of boundaries.  I’m only saying because I see a lot of “what does  this professional relationship mean” on reddit. Nobody really gave  a long through legally binding “ code of conduct” that serves as a social contract between teachers students and the province. I have enough experience to instinctively know if something is appropriate or not but not all teacher candidates do.


So can all confidently say that teachers say this is “ the explicit code “ that is made by a regulatory agency and is legally binding for all teachers, students and teacher candidates to dollow. I go over this with all my students  at beginning of year that way we can have a good professional relationship without any confusion and kids testing boundaries.

My name is Jim.
In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I was in a room I had never seen before, or had I?

It didn’t look recognizable, though I couldn’t remember anything. My mind was a complete blank slate. 

I wandered through narrow corridors. 

After about twenty minutes, I had found an exit hatch half buried in debris. 

I climbed out to sunlight that didn’t feel real.

The town was gone.

Buildings collapsed, streets melted. 

Cars twisted into rusted sculptures. 

Decomposing bones lay where people once stood.

The mountains smoked on the horizon.

I walked for hours, calling Laurie’s name, until I reached our house.

Inside, everything was ash or rot. 

Her side of the bed was empty.

I sat on the couch and cried until I couldn’t breathe.

When I looked up, the television was sitting on the coffee table, still intact.

Next to it lay the same history book from my classroom, open to the page about the Horsemen.

I read the line twice, tracing it with a shaking finger

“They appear as warning before great destruction before humanity’s own undoing.”

Then it all came back to me. 

The crash, the horseman, everything. 

I read over that passage again, then stared at the tv. 

I remembered the news reports. “Russians”, “War”, “Nuclear Bombs”. 

Outside, the wind picked up, carrying the sound of hoofbeats.

We try to help people any time that we can here, but most of us are booked with calls so it just is not a long term solution.

  
We have been receiving a ton of business from simple flyers posted in coffee shops, bookstores, etc. so we know that it is something that has demand. But we are not marketers and don't really know where to start to reach more people.

  
So, we are looking for someone that would take us to new heights with their ability to run a marketing campaign, however they deem best. There really are no limits here, other than legal and ethical boundaries. And we would be happy to pay a commission for any clients that book a call, which could really be thousands every month for someone that really knows how to get the message out there.

And honestly, that’s not always a bad thing.



Most people don’t realize this, but clinical trials are designed for new drugs, not natural compounds.

If a company develops a chemical that’s never existed before — like an antidepressant or anesthetic — they need clinical trials to prove it’s safe and effective before it hits the market.

That process costs millions.

But herbs, roots, and natural extracts? Those have been around for centuries, sometimes even documented in ancient pharmacopeias.



So here’s the reality:

If an ingredient like Cnidium Monnieri or Morinda Officinalis has already been used for hundreds of years for circulation, nerve balance, or libido support, it’s technically already “tested” — just not in a modern, double-blind placebo study.

Instead of lab data, these rely on traditional use + modern extraction science.



That’s the gap where brands like EjaGuard sit.

They’re not selling a “new drug.” They’re using time-tested herbs in a cleaner, more controlled form — designed to support natural control rather than numb everything like a lidocaine spray.

It’s kind of like comparing caffeine in coffee (everyone knows it works, even without a prescription) vs. a brand-new stimulant that needs to go through FDA approval.



Of course, not all “herbal” stuff is equal. You still want transparency — proper labeling, known ingredients, and real user feedback.

That’s why I always check if the formula has consistent reviews and a clear explanation of what’s inside, instead of random “miracle blends.”



So if you’re wondering why you don’t see PubMed studies on every natural product — that’s why. It’s not because they don’t work. It’s because they’re not drugs that can be patented and funded for trials.



Sometimes, ancient knowledge plus real-world use says enough.

And if it gives you more control in bed without killing sensation? That’s already a win in my book.

I started this tradition on the tail end of Covid because I was living far from friends and part of the tradition is that I pay for the resort and friends are just responsible for flights. We’ve also gone from 3 to 4 people which means two rooms instead of one.

Anyway, I’m hoping to be a little more conservative in cost this year but I feel like nothing is going to live up to Atelier. Has anyone been to resorts after going there and been happy? Resorts I’m considering:

- JOIA Paraiso Iberostar 
- Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya 
- Secrets Akumal
- Secrets Moxche
- Unico (wish it wasn’t such a far drive from the airport)
- Excellence Coral & Playa Muejeres

But also open to most anything in the general vicinity of Cancun as we’ll be flying from east coast US.

We’re in our late 30s/40s. We like good drinks, love the Atelier breakfast, coffee bar, somewhere good to lay on the beach (but don’t get in the water), and a good pool. A frustration of Atelier the last two years has been having to book reservations for dinner and not always getting a preferred location/time.

You can watch the full conversation here if you want the long version: [https://www.youtube.com/@PsycholojistWithDej](https://www.youtube.com/@PsycholojistWithDej)

I wanted to share the main things I learned because a lot of what I was doing was the *opposite* of good sleep hygiene.

# 1. Sleep actually starts in the morning

I always tried to fix sleep at night. She said the brain’s clock is set by *morning* light. Get 10 mins of outdoor light within 2–3 hours of waking (ideally earlier) and your melatonin will rise properly at night. Through a window doesn’t count.

# 2. Consistency beats perfection

You don’t need a 5 a.m. routine, you need a **regular** routine. Go to bed and wake up around the same time, even weekends. That trains the body clock way more than supplements.

# 3. Caffeine timing matters way more than I thought

Caffeine doesn’t give you energy, it just blocks adenosine. Her simple rule: no caffeine \~10 hours before bed, and don’t have your *first* coffee until 90 mins after waking. That way you’re not fighting your own biology.

# 4. Naps aren’t evil, just badly timed

If a nap makes it harder to sleep at night, it’s too long or too late. Early + short = fine. Late + long = you’ve just eaten before dinner.

# 5. Screens really do delay sleep

Bright screens at night tell the brain it’s daytime. She wasn’t anti-phone, she was anti-bright-blue-light-at-11pm. Her suggestion: have a 30-minute wind-down where lights are dim and no phone.

# 6. “I’m tired but I can’t sleep” is often stress

She said bed is the first time most people are quiet all day, so the brain finally dumps everything. If that’s you, do your worrying earlier — journaling, to-do list, whatever — so your brain isn’t trying to do it at 11:30 p.m.

# 7. Lazy days can mess up sleep

If you lie around all day, your sleep pressure doesn’t build. Move, get light, use your brain. Sleep likes active days.

# 8. Kids copy our bad habits

If you want good sleepers in the house, make it a family routine: earlier light, calmer evenings, phones out of bedrooms.

That’s the summary — nothing wild, but when I actually did it for a week my sleep window felt way easier. Although I am still posting this at 1.57am 🥲

**Your turn:**  
What’s the *one* thing that wrecks your sleep the most — screens, stress, inconsistent bedtimes, something else? And has anyone actually fixed their sleep without meds? I’d love to steal what worked for you. 👇",0,1762308886.0,psychologystudents,1,0.5,False

1ooqo5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1ooqo5q/complicated_feelings/,Complicated feelings,"I (24f) moved out of home and interstate at 19. I wanted to move out of my family home for as long as I could remember. 

My dad (autistic not diagnosed) travelled for work a lot when I was younger (like would only be home on the weekends for one day and even when he was was very emotionally distant and would spend the day out at sport). Consequently everything fell onto my mum who also worked ft. My grandma (her mum) lived with us since I was about 3. 

I do have two half siblings from my dads side who we barely saw ever. My oldest brother is diagnosed adhd. My youngest brother is diagnosed autism and my younger sister is his twin. So I grew up as the oldest sibling. All the attention went to my younger brother was was very violent from a very young age. I had to look after my sister and I. 

More times than I’d like to admit my sister and I were forgotten about and treated much differently (different rules for us, my grandma would buy my brother stuff and give him money and not us girls). My mum even left us in grocery stores multiple times driving home. Literally forgetting she had two girls. I ended up in a parental role with my sister. 

When I was 16, I got really high for the first time with friends and woke up dating this guy (my first boyfriend) who was 21. Within 2 months he moved in with me as he told me he had nowhere to stay (I’m much more aware now and know he was using me). Mum never charged him rent and fed him. 

My boyfriend abused me in every way and I told mum he sa me a lot. She ignored me. I graduated that year and went on a trip after school. I told my family I wanted him out by the time I was back. He got along really well with my younger brother and sort of emeshed himself in my family, despite us breaking up. 

My mum told me she couldn’t just kick someone out, and told me if I had an issues I should leave. My grandma also went to coffee with him and my brother (denying it at the time) and my mum and grandma often messaged him. 

I moved out at 19 and haven’t been back since. Mum has justified it by saying she must’ve been so busy she didn’t hear, after her attempts at telling me it never happened failed. My mum says we are just like any other family who fights. 

I talk to my grandma as she’s got signs of dementia and I want to make the last moments with her positive. Mum and I talk often and I’m convinced she’s narcissistic (not the new trendy version but my psychologist who had a few sessions with her too also said the same thing). She cannot help just lying and spinning it to say how much she loves me and how much I need her. 

I often feel a lot of regret as I’ve split the family and my family tells me all the time that I’ve overreacted and should just move on. And that I’m being too sensitive. 

I am fairly sure I’m autistic too however can’t afford to get tested. I can’t helped but feel I was overlooked and it’s in my best interest to just live my own life. My sister and I have stopped talking (long story) and I haven’t really spoken to my younger brother since as he doesn’t appear to have changed. My mum is getting sick and older and I love her a lot but I am worried I made the wrong decision to leave.

1ooqn2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ooqn2n/caffeine_and_panic_attacks/,Caffeine and Panic Attacks,"Okay this is going to be a long one. For a backstory, I (22M) recently graduated in May and took a job with a big GC as a field engineer on a billion+ dollar project. In college I was your typical frat guy, drinking every weekend,  regularly consuming roughly 400 mgs of caffeine a day, and using zyns every day from my sophomore through senior year.  Post grad,  I was really stoked to get a job in the construction industry and told myself that as long as I had time to lift everyday, I wouldn’t mind working 12 hour days. 

Well fast forward approximately 3 months and I had enough. It turns out working 60 hours a week combined with a long distance girlfriend had me abusing caffeine and nicotine like never before, not to mention not having time for the gym, and migraines from going to bed at different times each night (opening and closing site). It got to the point where I was doing sometimes 4 energy drinks (800+ mgs) a day with half a can of zyn on the side. 

Around 5 weeks ago I consumed too much caffeine at a conference with my old job and had what I think was my first ever panic attack. The biggest thing I noticed was this intense feeling of impending doom, where it felt like I was going to seize, and my heart felt as though it was going to beat out of my chest.  I drove myself home where my mother then called paramedics to check my vitals, and of course everything was fine, besides my elevated heart rate and blood pressure. It still felt like I was going to seize or have some sort of cardiac event so I went to urgent care, where they did an EKG and gave me fluids, before sending me on my way. I went back for the remainder of the conference the next day and then worked that Saturday and Sunday, closing the job site one night, and opening it the next. I worked that week, and had a bad migraine the entire week, along with some dissociation, as I cut my coffee intake to 1 cup a day and quit nicotine cold turkey.  I closed site again that Thursday, the same day I put my 2 weeks in, and showed up to work Friday morning. 

Friday morning I was in a meeting with some of our subcontractors after I had a cup of coffee, and it sent me into another panic attack. I had to go to the site medic tent and get checked out, where I was shaking to the point of convulsing, went cold, and had the same impending doom that felt like I was going to pass out or seize. One of my coworkers drove me to the hospital where they did an MRI and CAT scan that showed enlarged ventricle’s, but nothing serious, so they discharged me that night at around 9.

Well, that was a mistake because the impending doom came back on my ride home (another coworker brought my truck to the hospital), and I had to pull over and ask my buddy to come get me. I was out of work for the next three days.

The following Tuesday I saw the neurologist at the Hospital who told me to quit everything cold turkey, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and prescribed me Quilipta for migraines. She also told me to stop working for the next 6 weeks lmao.  The headaches I continued to have for the next two weeks were super intense and it felt like my head was going to explode, accompanied with horrible vision that made driving an issue, but I returned to work that Thursday and tried to give it my best for my last couple weeks. I had to get a coworker to drive me, because of how bad my vision was, but I was able to make it through.

The following week I went back to the ER to try to get some answers, because my head still felt like it was going to explode and my brain fog was so bad it felt like I was going crazy.  They discharged me after a CAT scan and a thyroid test, confirming that I was indeed fine, and that’s left me here.

Now I’m 3 1/2 weeks on no Caffeine and no Nicotine (No alcohol either).  I started my new job two weeks ago, (in the Financial Services space) and while my headaches are basically gone, my brain fog is still horrendous and I feel like I’m really underperforming in my new role. Today at work it felt like I was going to spiral into another panic attack and I couldn’t understand why. I’ve been getting better sleep, (new job is 9-5) working out after work, and eating super healthy, but my brain fog is still there and I have horrible dissociation.  Is this normal to be experiencing this with quitting cold turkey? I’ve read through a lot of the stories on this sub and seems like many people had way worse caffeine addictions, with way shorter recovery spans, and little to no panic attacks.

I recently got a new job at a cafe as most of the team left for better opportunities (what I was told). On the first day, I already hated it. It wasn’t what I expected, I applied for a barista position and made it clear that’s what I wanted to focus on. They even tested me and asked me to make a cup on the spot and I did manage to make it nicely (if I do say so myself) with very nice latte art. I was hired shortly after. The first day made me realised that this was basically not in line with what I was looking for. I did not/ was allowed to make a single cup of coffee (or drink actually) and all I did was buss tables and serve food. 

The main reasons for my dissatisfaction is:
-  not being let to make coffee/ drinks even though I am experienced and would require minimal to no training, and me making it clear it’s what I looked for when applied
- pay is low, less than what’s in line for my experience and certification. I have seen places offering more for candidates with ZERO experience
- no food is provided, but the mall it is located in is a mid to high end one. There are just no cheap food alternatives etc. everything there are high end restaurants. We are not even allowed to stay in the shop for breaks, having to sit outside in the mall areas (it is open air, so no air conditioning)

I am by no means trying to toot my horn or brag, but these are genuine concerns of mine. What do you think my next course of action should be? I’m genuinely not happy. Bottom line I don’t want to wake up feeling miserable and dread going into work, which is whats happening unfortunately. This is a part time role so I can at least not give hours if I don’t want to.

Our previous stay was in rainy season so there was not much to see, but this time around the weather really cooperated and we can see the true beauty of nature.

This is a GREAT quality of life update, as before during the banya treament 2 people would squeeze into that one big platform and getting in and out is kinda hard. After the update as you can see, 2 fully seperate treatment bed with bean bag mattress.

On top of the redo on the sauna room, they refreshed all the wood flooring/trims/exterior walls. So instead of greyish looking, now it is the fresh natural wood tone like the ones you see in the Sauna room (the treatment beds). Wish I have a picture but we did not take any pictures of that.

The Food

This is the area that most people complained about, but to us the food was already pretty good for a resort. But this time, they improved by A LOT as they did changed the executive chef. The whole menu got a overhual for the better and we did try to order the pomelo salad which was no longer on the menu. Somehow they can still recreate it and it is just as good. The portion size also got a lot bigger, even though we have the full board. We did check the price on the menu and it is very fair for what you get. The Grilled baby scallops are a MUST try.

Activities

We did the guided snorkeling, guided Goga Peak Trek and the food tour at Phang Rang.

Snorkeling  
This is my first time snorkeling I am short sighted and couldnt fit my glasses within the goggle. They do offer a short sighted goggles but it won't be the clearest. If you are short sighted please keep that in mind. With that being said I was still able to see most of the coral/fishes/sea urchins/star fish. The guide was super knowledgable and would dive and pick up some star fish/sea urchins for me to see and feel. Also saw crabs and goats along the coast, which is also amazing

Goga Peak  
Really recommand people to do this, you can truly see how massive amanoi is from far and it is only around 15 to 20 minutes each way. Even though it was a bit cloudy when we did it, it was still very impressive.

Spa  
Never did a treatment at the spa house as we do have our private treatment room. All I can say is we both fell asleep at every treatment. This time we had amanoi massage, groudning massage, Banya treatment, indian head massage. It was all truly amazing especially the banya treatment. It almost feels like a theatrical expereince as you first started off with sauna for around 10 minutes. Rest a bit, then you go back to the sauna but this time you lie down on the treatment bed and they would smack you with the eucalyptus leaf, after a few minutes you rest. And you repeat this iirc 3 times, but each time the temptaure is getting hotter and hotter. Each mini section when you feel like its unbareable the treatment will just maigcally finish and its time to rest. Then its followed by cold plunge and relaxing inside the pool, where 2 staff will hold you up, and you can fully relax your body almost like you are in a floating pod. You also get a scrub with coffee and some other mixtures in the sauna room (this time around they will open the door, so its not as inetnse as before). After the scrub it is followed by some bamboo smacking in the treatment room.

Overall  
Do keep in mind amanoi is in the national park there will be bugs/insects around no matter how much they treat/care for it. I have seen wild cats there as well. But I have never seen any bugs inside the room! They truly makes you feel like home away from home. Service is ALWAYS perfect. Its is also very important to say that they are truly connected to the local culture.

Amanoi will always have a special place in my heart and would 100% recommand anyone want a taste of what Aman is all about.",6,1762308089.0,chubbytravel,8,1.0,False

1ooqfkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1ooqfkr/how_to_make_weirdly_deep_friendships_as_an_adult/,How to make weirdly deep friendships as an adult (without forcing it or getting ghosted),"You’re not imagining it. Making long-term, reliable, ride-or-die friendships as an adult is **insanely** rare these days. Most of us are stuck in a cycle of polite group hangs, IG likes, and flaky “let’s catch up sometime” texts that never happen. And if you’ve moved cities, changed jobs, or simply outgrown your old crew, the isolation hits even harder.

This post is not therapy-speak or TikTok fluff. I’ve spent weeks digging into actual research, high-quality podcasts, expert books, and neuroscience-backed insights to piece together why adult friendships are harder, and how to change that. Plus, let’s be honest, most popular advice out there is either way too vague (“just be yourself!”) or weirdly transactional (“network your way into friendships”? no thanks).

The truth is — there’s *nothing wrong with you*. But there are forces at play making deep adult connections harder than ever. The good news? There are **real tools** to work around it. This post shares the best ones.

---

**Here’s what actually works if you want to make long-lasting adult friendships that don’t fizzle after 2 hangs:**

* **Proximity still rules. So stop underestimating repeated low-stakes interaction.**
  * Study after study (UCLA’s Friendship Project, MIT’s classic dorm proximity study) shows that casual, repeat exposure (same class, gym, cafe, coworking space) is the single most powerful factor in friendship formation. Not your personality. Not your deep convos. Just *bumping into someone a lot*.
  * So instead of chasing chemistry, choose places where you can show up regularly. This is why joining recurring clubs, hobby groups, run clubs, or Sunday basketball works better than one-off meetups.

* **Overshare early. Seriously, be weird on purpose.**
  * This one’s backed by Dr. Marisa Franco, psychologist and author of “Platonic” (2022). People underestimate how much others like them after they get vulnerable. This is called the *liking gap*.
  * Skip the small talk. Try saying “I’m so bad at making adult friends, but I’m trying to get better, want to grab a coffee next week?” People are way more into it than you think.

* **Text first. Then text again. More than you think you “should.”**
  * In a massive 2022 study from the University of Pittsburgh analyzing over 13,000 adults, the single most cited reason friendships faded was “I didn’t want to seem needy.” Turns out, *literally everyone* thought the *other person* didn’t want to reconnect.
  * So yeah, that friend who hasn’t texted in months? They probably want to hear from you too. Go message them first.

* **Use “shared goals” to fast-track closeness.**
  * According to Priya Parker (author of *The Art of Gathering*), one-on-one meetups are fine, but thriving adult social circles are built around **shared missions**. Think: learning something together, volunteering, training for a marathon, building a startup, starting a book club.
  * Purpose creates bonding. And it gives you a reason to keep showing up.

* **Stack your hangouts. This hack massively increases stickiness.**
  * Sociologist Dr. Daniel Cox’s research on declining friendship rates notes that people are most likely to maintain friendships when they **stack** social time with *other* goals: exercise, errands, kid stuff, hobbies. 
  * So instead of grabbing a drink, say: “Want to go walk Trader Joe’s with me and complain about life?” Weirdly effective.

---

**If you want to go way deeper (and actually change how you show up in your friendships), here are some resources that are insanely good:**

* ***Book: “Platonic” by Dr. Marisa Franco***
  * This book won’t just teach you how to be a better friend. It’ll rip open your old belief systems about connection, self-worth, and why we get friendship so wrong in adulthood.
  * Dr. Franco is a psychologist and professor at University of Maryland who blends rigorous science with real-life advice. She covers everything from why romantic obsession dwarfs friend-care in our culture, to practical scripts for rekindling old friendships.
  * Absolute must-read. *This book will make you question everything you’ve assumed about what friendship should look like*.

* ***Podcast: “We Can Do Hard Things” by Glennon Doyle***
  * This podcast is not directly about friendship, but it’s about *relational courage*. It models the kind of conversations we should be having with our closest friends — raw, funny, emotionally honest, and messy.
  * There’s a killer episode on “Friendship Breakups” (Ep. 120) that’s like therapy and a group chat had a baby.

* ***YouTube: The School of Life – “Why We Have So Few Friends”***
  * Alain de Botton’s channel breaks down weirdly deep ideas in short, thoughtful videos. This one covers the societal trap of “efficiency” and how modern life killed the organic, slow-burn process of making real friends.
  * Their animations are smart and dead-on. Watch while you eat lunch. It’ll shift your mindset fast.

* ***App: Finch***
  * Finch is a gamified self-care and habit tracker, but it works *amazingly well* for creating small consistency around friendships, like reaching out to one friend per week.
  * You can set social goals like “text someone today,” and it turns it into a part of your wellness plan. The dopamine hits help.

* ***App: BeFreed***
  * BeFreed is a super smart AI-powered learning app built by researchers from Columbia University. It curates podcasts and learning snippets around your goals — including deepening relationships, building EQ, and improving self-awareness, which are *foundational* for sustaining friendships.
  * You choose how deep you want to go — 10, 20, or 40 minutes — and the tone of your host. What’s wild is that it learns what you listen to and builds a personalized learning roadmap over time.
  * It pulls from books, psychology research, TED talks, and even relationship therapy sessions. If you’re short on time but want deeper emotional tools, this makes the process feel low-lift but high impact.

* ***App: Ash***
  * Ash is built for mental health reflection. If emotional intimacy freaks you out or you avoid conflict with friends, this app helps you journal and reflect on how you’re showing up in relationships.
  * It also gives suggestions and scripts based on your mood — think of it as your inner therapist.

* ***Online Learning: MasterClass***
  * Yes, it’s pricey. But their *Esther Perel* series on relational intelligence is absolute gold. She dives into attraction, conflict, vulnerability, and communication — and not just for couples. It’s amazing for learning how to *actually communicate needs and boundaries* with friends too.

Real talk? Deep friendship is not built in DMs or by reacting to stories. It’s built in **small repeated actions**, awkward asks, and emotional risk. If you only take one thing away from this post, let it be this:

I have lost weight before using a calorie deficit and cardio/walking mainly. This time around I've picked up running and want to make it apart of my lifestyle. 

I plan to cut out most unnecessary sugars, except for a few here and there that help me keep my appetite at bay (as a binge eater), such as the creamer for my coffee and maybe a latte here and there. 

I originally went from 270, to 185, and gained 15 back over the course of about 8 months. This was my fault because I honestly just started over eating again. However I don't feel discouraged, but feel encouraged because I know I can lose the weight and more again because I've done it before. 

I've always been overweight, and have never been at a ""healthy"" weight. I WANT to be a healthy weight, I need it. I need to know what I'll look like and all the other things. I'm going to post here as I progress because I've done this before with a different account that I no longer have access to. I think the community will help me remain motivated. 

I would like to set a goal of losing 1-2 pounds a week. This morning I weighed 200.8, and by next Tuesday I would like to be 198.

When I wake up, I drink about 6oz of coffee with creamer and sugar. Around 5 hours later, I have a 12oz can of soda with lunch. That’s all I drink all day. I didn’t actually realize I had stopped drinking practically all together until today… From what I can recall, this began around 1.5 weeks ago. I just don’t feel thirsty, so it didn’t even cross my mind that I don’t drink anything at all, all day pretty much. 

My urine output has remained the same. No color change, no amount differences—all normal. I had bloodwork done at a doctor’s appointment recently for unrelated issues and my kidney function was normal, as were my electrolytes. 

Other things I’ve now taken note of since I’m now noticing my lack of thirst: 

• Dizziness upon standing 
• Increased heart rate (15-20 beats above my normal while resting.) 
• Chest pain (have been to the ER for this as early heart attacks run in my family history; ECG and chest X-Ray were both normal.)

I take:

• Abilify Maintena 400mg/once every 28 days (Have been on this medication for years.) 
• Adderall XR 20mg/once daily (Have been on this medication for 2 months.) 
• Adderall IR 10mg/twice daily as needed (Have been on this medication for 2 months.) 
• Zepbound 12.5mg/once every 7 days (For weight loss. Have been on this medication since January while titrating dosages up. 12.5mg for almost 2 months now.)

I’ll let it be known as well that I mentioned to this friend about my financial situation from the beginning. I was worried about having the money for a vacation like this because at the time I was having a hard time affording some basic necessities in my life. And S was aware of this.
S told the group that we should have a small part of us drive to the location and the others all fly. S wanted to bring her vehicle since it was able to hold a bunch of people and the luggage so that those who fly wouldn’t have to worry about luggage claim at the airport when they arrived to and from the location. I offered to fly if no one else wanted to, but others in the group wanted to fly. I offered them to drive with S so that she wouldn’t be by herself. 
More planning started and we came up with spending almost a whole week at the destination and we started planning each individual day. We tried to plan for rest days where we wouldn’t do too much. We were planning on having a day to rest after we arrive where we’d all go kayaking. Day 2 would be going to a popular park and enjoying some time hanging out there. Day 3 was planned to have dinner reservations at a particularly fancy place. We planned also that day to just hang out. Day 4 we planned to have a beach day and enjoying some time the sun since some of us hadn’t seen the ocean before. Day 5 was lunch reservations at a popular buffet in the area and later going to a party in a popular park. S offered to pay for everyone when we would be at the lunch buffet. S also offered to pay for everyone tickets to the party and just have us pay her back when we can. Day 6 was everyone either flying or driving back to our home town. 
I’m the midst of our planning, S’s mother wanted to join us since she had obligations around that area and told us that she wasn’t going to going to our destinations while we were all there. We all approved of that. After that though, S’s sister chimed in asking to go stating that she hasn’t had a vacation in a long time. Most of us weren’t too happy to let her in on our vacation, but S convinced the rest of the group to let her join stating that she’d be doing her own thing and promising she wouldn’t be in the way. After this it was decided that we’d all need large rooms. So S, T, V and C would be in a room together. And I would be roomed with S’s mother and sister. We were told that each of the rooms have 2 separate bedrooms and large beds with their own kitchens attached. I was assured that I’d be okay being roomed with S’s mother and sister. I was okay with this since I’d known them both for a long time and trusted S’s mother.
So, we continued planning and S told the group that we were going to using hotels from her parents time share in the area. And we were told that this helps  a lot and saves us in having to book a couple of rooms for a hotel in the area we were going to be in. 
We started planning more of the trip day by day. As we got closer to the date, I was panicking because I hadn’t gotten a chance to buy my tickets for the party and was worried that I wouldn’t be able to purchase them before the trip. S told me not to worry and that she’d purchase it for me and I can just pay her back at a later date. I was relieved. S and I also started planning our drive to the destination. Per our directions that we input the trip should take about 24+ hr to reach the destination. I was fine with this and mentioned to S that I had made the trip before a couple years prior with my brother. I discussed with her about the route that my brother and I took and told her a specific way we should take to avoid tolls and rely pretty heavily on cruise control. S wanted to talk with her father about my route as she told me that he’s made the trip more to that area more than I have. I was a bit taken a back from bit, but went along with it and listened to him to see what he had to say about it. The route that was suggested would add a lot of time to the drive. I prompted my route to him and he wasn’t really liking what I was suggesting. S sided with her father and we were going to go with that route instead of mine. I was a bit pissed, but my words were getting through to anyone.
The group that was going to fly had all their tickets purchased and ready to go.
As the day to start the vacation got closer I got really excited. That is until the actual day came for S and I to start our drive to the destination. Both S and I had talked the week prior about how we’d handle the gas and driving shifts so that we wouldn’t become too tired or anything. Originally we’d agreed on me giving her $80 for gas to contribute since it was her vehicle. But I reconsidered and thought it’d be rude of me to do that, so I suggested I pay for gas on the way down and S pay for gas on the way back. S agreed to that plan. S was supposed to pick me up from my place the morning/afternoon before we were supposed to start driving. I texted both S and T to see when they’d both be by since we had to go and pick up luggage from V and Cs place to start packing up the car. Both of them said that they’d be by in the early afternoon around 2pm or so. I relaxed a bit after hearing that and proceeded to extra check all my luggage to make sure that I had all of my stuff with me for the trip. It was about 2:30pm when I still hadn’t been picked up and I messaged them both asking if they were on the way. They usually message me when they are on the way over, so it was a bit odd that they hadn’t yet. I got a response from T that they were running late and said they be by around 4 instead. I was a but Ker-fuffled over this and asked if they could let me know when they’d be by. The finally showed up at almost 5pm to pick me up. I was a bit pissed, but rolled with it. We got to V and Cs place around 5:30pm and got the luggage in the car. We then had to stop for gas which I paid for, $90 later. I started to recognize at this point what I’d gotten myself into. We stopped at a grocery store before heading back to S’s place to relax and sleep for the night. Finally getting to her place around 10pm. Our plan was to start driving around 1am the next morning and arrive to our destination by Atleast 10am or so the following day. 
I got about 3hr of sleep before having to get up again and start the journey with S. S was going to start the driving herself since she was a bit of a night owl and I wasn’t. I was okay with that since I’m a bit of an early morning person. In the car, I did sleep for about another 3hr before I could feel/hear the safety bumps on the shoulder of the highway buzzing the car. I was wide awake at that point and asked if S wanted to switch with me and I’d drive for a bit. S said yes and at this point it was around 5am. We stopped at a rest area and I asked which route we were taking to so that I could I put the directions in my phone. S told me that she was inputting specific capital cities in the states we were traveling in and going from there. I had to think for a moment after hearing that and thought it was a bit odd and I asked her if I could input the address of where we’re are going to keep us on track. S declined giving me the address and said that we’d be okay inputting the cities and going from there. She wasn’t really letting me use my phone for directions during the whole trip. It got to around 1pm or so and I wasn’t getting hungry. We were at about a third of the way there at this point so I thought it’d be nice to get some lunch. We stopped a a restaurant that was on the billboard and we enjoyed a nicely themed lunch for the area we were in at the time. I offered to continue driving because I wasn’t feeling tired and thought that I’d be able to handle it. I lasted about another 4 hours. I asked to swap and S said we could. I started to lull off in the passenger seat and was awoken about 3hr later to S asking to swap again. I said sure and drove more. It was around 8:30pm when we swapped back to me driving and I was stopping at almost all gas stations along the way to wither grab gas or coffee or both. In this point in the trip alone, I’d spent $240 on just gas for her car. I drove for probably another I would say 5 hours and I was tired as I could have been. We got to a point in the trip where I was struggling to stay awake a bit and with the winding roads in some parts with higher speeds, it was hard. Other traffic around me melding together. I snapped a bit at S because I was tired at the time and she asked if I was mad at her. At this point in the driving, yeah, I was a bit mad at her since I had done the majority of the driving. We stopped at a rest area as soon as I found one. I got out of the car and booked it for the bathrooms not wanting to come out. After about 20min I walked out of the bathrooms, I sat on a bench outside the bathrooms and broke down crying badly. I was stressed, angry and anxious about the rest of the drive. S came up behind me while I was crying on the bench and just leaned on me, not saying a work. I had so much anger in me at that moment due to lack of sleep that I just could t speak to her. After about an hour of being at the rest area, we both slept in the car for about an hour. After we both woke up, we got back on the road. S started driving for that time and this time she lasted about 4hr before we swapped again. We began to feel really crunched for time and flew a bit down the highway to get to our destination. I got us to a part of our destination around right on time approx at 12pm.
Once we got to our destination, S and I learned that the rest of the group is a bit held up at the airport trying to get a rental car for the trip. There was apparently an issue with the cards they were using. S and I were told that they’d be over in a little bit. We got to chatting in our friend group chat and agreed on having us all meet at a local eatery and get some food together. S and I waited for them in the parking lot until they told us that they were on the way. We asked for seating to be prepared for our large group and the employees were very nice about it! They all arrived at the eatery and we got seated. V and C could tell that I was visibly exhausted and asked what happened. I wasn’t really into talking about it in front of S at that time so I said that I just don’t want to drive at all during this whole trip. They didn’t pry and further but gave me the biggest hugs that almost made me cry. 
After we finished eating, we headed to the hotel where we’d all be staying. The car ride wasn’t too far away from the eatery we were at so it was nice. T offered to drive us to the hotel to let S and I rest a bit. I agreed, but I wanted to be in the other vehicle and not in S’s car. The rest of the group was fine with that. I vented a bit in the car with them about what happened. S’s mother told me that it’d be okay and that she’d want to talk to me once we all get settled into the hotel.
Once we got checked in to the hotel and had our keys, everyone helped unload the car. S’s mother and sister lead me to our room and we started to get unpacked a bit. S’s mother offered to all of us to have her go grocery shopping and get us all food for the week for when we aren’t at our destinations. We all appreciated this and I offered to go so that I’d be able to get some things that I’d want. S’s mother thought that I should rest, but I didn’t want to yet. We went shopping near the hotel and got what we needed. Once back, we all unloaded the car and separated our stuff for everyone. Once back at the hotel, I crashed the fuck out. Like sleep til you can’t sleep no more. I crashed at about 7pm when we got back from shopping til damn near 8-9am the following morning. I was tired as hell…
The others started to wake up around 11am and we started to get ready for that days part of the trip, kayaking. I learned while we were driving to go kayaking, that most of the group went to a popular park in the area while I was asleep. I thought that I’d really missed out, but I was tired and didn’t think that I would be up for something like that. V and C said that they were out til almost 1am and said that they really didn’t want to be out that late with kayaking planned for the following day. Overall, kayaking went really well and we had a good time hanging out. We didn’t really finish kayaking until about 6pm when the day was almost done. We didn’t really get to do much else at the kayaking park. It was advertised that there was a swimming area and condensation. We were excited to be able to eat some food when there until we found that the swimming area and concessions were closed for the season. We were a bit taken aback from learning this since S told us that it would be open and we’d be able to eat. We all wound up leaving the park with empty stomachs and stopping for some fast food on the way back to the hotel. Once we got back to the hotel, we all were a bit tired so we went to bed. 
The next day was going to be going to a large popular park having me, S, T, V, C and S’s sister. I had never been to this park and was excited to go S and her sister were planning on going early in the morning around when they were set to open and I asked to join to see if I could walk around before it go too busy to do so. They both said yes. We were going to let V, C and T sleep in a bit and meet them at the park. As we were walking through the park, I was finding that pretty much everything they have there is super expensive. Food and drink especially. I hadn’t really budgeted for that and paying for gas on the way up really dug into my funds for the trip itself. After a bit of the 3 of us being at this park, the rest of the group arrived and we all go to hanging out. S’s sister departed our group to let us hang out a bit. V and C were talking a bit with me about the cost of stuff and I agreed. The prices were crazy for the amount of food/drink you get. Like $16 for 8oz of wine at this park and $15 for a very small portion of food. S overheard us talking and goes about damn near freaking out on us saying that we should have expected this. We were expecting the trip to be expensive, but the cost of some things didn’t seem worth being there to hang out and enjoy our time. T butted In trying to be a bit of a peacekeeper and trying to keep everyone happy at the park. We all spent the rest of the day just lulling about the park and keeping our feelings compressed to not bug S more. At the end of the day, we all went back to the hotel and rested for the night.

Initially had the idea of becoming an IP/patent attorney but decided to pursue an adjacent path and pivoted to data privacy. Due to personal and economic considerations (I was navigating the immigration journey simultaneously with law school and poverty), I immediately took a JD preferred job out of law school because I was so dirt poor I couldn’t even afford to take the bar exam. 
Currently, I have a couple of years of experience supporting commercial counsel and managing privacy operations for clients. As I contemplate the next steps in my career, I wanted to know if transitioning into a legal position (either firm or in house) is possible for me? What skills would I have to develop or showcase to potential employers? I was thinking of taking certification exams, writing some blog posts or articles for my company blog or publish elsewhere, try to organize events etc. 
Also, as someone who lives in a smaller market and works a fully remote job, how do I go about networking and finding attorneys that would be open to mentorship or coffee chats. 
(I am writing this on a long bus journey so I apologize for poor organization and any typos. I have been pondering these questions for a while with no answers. Any guidance will be appreciated.)

1ooq4by,https://www.reddit.com/r/misophonia/comments/1ooq4by/my_secret_is_finally_out_at_work/,My secret is finally out at work! 😆,"I can’t say for sure when I first realised that I had a problem with the sounds of people eating, but it’s definitely got worse in recent years. I’ve put it down to me just getting older (M 51) and generally becoming more grumpy and intolerant of things I don’t like, but it’s definitely developed into more of an issue for me.

For a while now I’ve struggled with it at work at various times throughout the day, but have never said anything to my colleagues. I’m in a fairly quiet office of only 10 people, and my room has 5 of us. My main triggers are crunchy foods and sloppy foods, and whilst we have a small kitchen for prepping food and drinks, we all usually eat our lunches at our desks, and obviously there’s snacks too. I’ve never mentioned it because I don’t want anyone to feel self conscious about eating around me. It’s MY problem, not theirs after all. However last week there was a moment where I just had to leave the room and for whatever reason I felt the need to explain why.

One of my colleagues has a regular schedule that includes eating his apple at around 10:30, and for some reason he always stands up to do so, which makes the sound travel even more. That’s when I go downstairs to the kitchen to make a coffee. Then there’s another colleague who bites and chews his crisps (really loudly!) with an open mouth and that’s just about the worst trigger for me. If I can’t leave the room at that point I’ll put my AirPods in until he’s finished. My boss also has a habit of walking around the office discussing jobs with us, whilst also eating his pot of porridge (am), bag of crisps (lunch), or a pear (pm) and it’s sometimes really hard to stay composed and focus on the conversation. The fight or flight response is sometimes surprisingly strong!

Well the other morning it had been a particularly frustrating journey into the office, and upon my arrival I’d discovered that my crisp crunching colleague had still not finished the simple task I’d assigned him a coupe of days before. It should’ve been a 2-3 hour job and he’d stretched it out to two days! I was under pressure from the client to get stuff done so I was a little highly strung already. Then at that moment my boss pulled up a chair next to me with the intention of discussing progress, but he was also eating his porridge! I felt trapped! I tried to explain why but I simply had to stand up and leave the room right then. It’s the strongest response I’ve had in a while. As soon as I got out it occurred to me that my reaction would’ve seemed a bit irrational to everyone, and I was worried I’d offended my boss.

Anyway after cooling down a little, and giving my boss time to finish his porridge, I came back in to further explain why I’d reacted so. He understood, wasn’t offended and clearly just found it amusing. Not the worst way it could’ve gone I suppose.

He’s since made a few jokes about not eating around me, and has in fact left the room again when he’d accidentally walked in with food. There’s been a bit of banter, but nothing I can’t handle, and at least now people know why I sometimes have to ‘randomly’ leave the room or put my headphones in!",4,1762307226.0,misophonia,0,1.0,False
1ooq47o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1ooq47o/i_feel_lost/,I feel lost,"Hello everyone. I’m 22 years old and currently attending university for a degree in Neurobiology with a minor in Chemistry. I’m a super senior (been in Uni for +5 years), and honestly, I feel completely lost in life. I’m not necessarily depressed, but I do feel like I’m wasting my time. I don’t really have a passion for school anymore — I kind of lost it over time, and it’s something I’ve been struggling with a lot.

I currently work 36 hours a week from Friday to Sunday (three 12-hour shifts) and go to school Monday through Thursday — sometimes even on Fridays when I have exams or quizzes. I feel tired all the time, both mentally and physically. I’m taking two hard classes right now: Organic Chemistry I and Calculus-Based Physics I. I have *zero* motivation or passion to do schoolwork or even care about what I’m learning.

I love baking and cooking, and I’ve been thinking that once I finish my degree, I want to focus on opening my own bakery or coffee shop. But it feels so distant because it seems like I’m never going to finish school. I’ve thought about dropping out, but I’m scared of disappointing everyone in my life — and disappointing myself. I work my ass off to pay for tuition, which barely leaves me any time to rest.

I still live with my parents, and we don’t have a good relationship at all. I want to move out, but if I do, I’d only be able to take one class per semester, which would make my degree take even longer — and that kills my motivation even more.

One of my parents lost their job recently, and I’ve been having to help cover the mortgage for the house with my two older siblings. It’s been really stressful. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I work really hard, but I feel like I’m going nowhere.

I had left my card for the purpose of my visit, and two or three weeks later he called me and invited me on a date and feeling adventurous, I said yes!  Life has me super busy and I kept having to push out our date a couple of weeks but I did have time to notice that he started immediately sending me hearts in text, I purposely have been cool in my responses yet the hearts keep coming. We finally met for a walking date, and I would say we have actually a fair bit in common, but he does not make my heart beat faster and I don’t know if it’s his accent or what but I had to ask him to repeat himself several times and he touched/held my upper arms at least eight times in a 2 mile walk to the point where I kept taking my cardigan that I had tied around my waist on and off to keep my arms busy!  He snapped a selfie of us.  After our second time around the lake, I let him know that I needed to go and we hugged quickly  goodbye and he asked if he could have a second date and God help me I said sure maybe we can have coffee sometime, and we went our separate ways.  Within minutes, he texted me that he would be down on his knees if I would take him - which I ignored-  and he continues to text me throughout the day. Good morning. Hope you have a great day. How is your day? How was your day? Hope your day was great. Good night all with hearts… I should mention also that one of my coworkers ran into him and he was asking about me and she felt like he had love at first sight with me so today I told her that I finally did go out on the date with him, but he didn’t make my heart beat any faster and it was not going anywhere, but she thought he was cool… Anyway, I never should have said yes to a coffee because that is just dragging it out, but I don’t know what to say at this point to stop this guy. Oh also in our conversation, I mentioned that I am selling an extra car that I have and he asked me how much it was and he said he’ll buy it lol I can’t do that, then I feel like I will be tied to him!!

1ooq0tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1ooq0tq/im_a_hospital_nightshift_maintenance_tech_dont/,I’m a hospital night-shift maintenance tech. Don’t ever open a door that says SERVICE.,"I don’t even know if anyone’s ever going to read this.

I’m just dumping it into Notes because it’s the only app that still opens right now, and the battery icon’s been stuck at 18% for… I don’t know, a while. Long enough that I’m starting to hate that number. The time in the corner says 2:17 a.m. and hasn’t moved.

If this ever pops up on somebody’s screen and it just reads like some guy falling apart, that’s… yeah, that’s probably accurate. I’m not going to pretend I’ve got this under control. But if you’re the kind of person who wanders into stairwells with no signage “just to see where they go,” I need you to read this all the way through.

And then I need you not to be that person.

I work nights in building maintenance at St. Alban’s Medical Center in Phoenix. Technically, my badge says “Building Systems Technician II,” which sounds like I should have a lab coat, but in reality I still plunge toilets and un-jam automatic doors.

St. Alban’s is one of those hospitals you drive past on 7th Street near the 202 and don’t really notice. Beige concrete, mirrored windows, sad little shrubs that die every summer and get replaced every winter.

I’m thirty–four—wait, no, I had a birthday in June. Thirty–five.
My brain keeps defaulting to thirty–four like it’s trying to save me one year on the wear-and-tear.

Night shift is usually quiet. A couple nurses, one ER doc, a sleepy security guard. The building settles into this constant background noise: HVAC, ice machines, telemetry alarms, wheels on linoleum. It all turns into one low hum. You don’t notice it until it stops.

The night this started, I was covering for Kyle, who called out “sick” but I’d bet a week’s pay it was because the Coyotes had a late game. Midnight to eight. I grabbed a cup of cafeteria coffe before they shut down at eleven. It already tasted like the pot was on its second day.

Around one, my radio crackled.

“Facilities, this is admitting,” Rojas said. “We’ve got a flickering light in the old admin corridor. It’s giving Mrs. Harvey a migraine.”

“Copy,” I said. “I’ll head up.”

The “old admin corridor” is the forgotten wing on three that used to have HR and billing before they moved everything downstairs and half-online. Now it’s dusty records, empty offices, and people who don’t want to be found.

I grabbed a ladder, a spare 2x4 LED troffer, my tool bag, logged it, and took the service elevator up.

The doors opened onto a dim hallway. Motion-sensor lights clicked up as I walked: hoodie, scuffed boots, badge with a curling “HAPPY 35” post-it.

The bad light was easy to spot—one panel twitching bright/dim/off like it couldn’t pick a setting. I set the ladder up, climbed, and popped the diffuser.

The plenum above should’ve been a throatful of sound: air handlers, duct noise. It was still. Cooler, too, just enough to raise the hair on my arm.

The LED panel looked fine. Wiring solid, no heat marks. The sticker on the back, though:

LITHONIA LIGHTING 2G7 2X4 TROFFER 4000K.

We use 2GT8s. I’ve written that model number so many times my hand could do it alone.

“Sure,” I muttered. “Typos all the way up the chain.”

I gave a tired little laugh.

Then everything turned off.

Not just the light. The building.

HVAC roar, ICU beeps, distant traffic—gone. My ears rang in the vacuum.

The panel flared once and died.

The corridor dropped into solid black so fast my stomach lurched. I grabbed the ladder.

My flashlight was on my belt. I fumbled it out and clicked it on.

The old admin corridor was still there.

Sort of.

Same beige walls, same brown handrail, same desert print with “COMMUNITY” under it. But the hallway was longer, stretched. More doors than there should’ve been, like someone copy-pasted a few extra. The far end sat too far away.

“What the hell,” I said. Hearing my voice helped.

I climbed down. My boots hit the carpet with no sound.

That, more than anything, made my skin crawl.

I turned to where the elevator lobby should’ve been.

Gone.

Fifteen feet away: a beige wall with a red EXIT door and glowing green sign.

I turned the other way.

Same thing. Red EXIT door. No elevators. No stairwell. Just two outs that hadn’t existed a minute before.

I walked to the nearest door. Through the wired glass, I saw another hallway: same carpet, same doors, fluorescents buzzing.

“Breaker tripped,” I told myself. “Weird re-route. Old prints. Whatever.”

I hit the bar.

The door swung open. When it shut behind me, it sounded thin, like a fridge door.

I turned immediately to wedge it open.

Drywall.

No door. No EXIT sign. Just a blank wall and an empty extinguisher cabinet.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope nope nope.”

The hallway could’ve been any back-of-house corridor. Low-pile carpet, handrails, metal doors: 317, 319, 321. The number plates leaned a little, like whoever stuck them on did it fast.

I tried a handle. Locked. Another. Locked.

The wall clocks were the same cheap black-rimmed model we use, but all of them showed 2:22. Second hands frozen.

My phone still said 2:17.

I hit a T-junction with an overhead sign:

← 300–312
→ 300–312

I picked left.

The smell shifted to faint chlorine, like a drained indoor pool. My footsteps made zero sound. I stomped once; the silence stayed.

“Hello?” I called.

My voice echoed back a half-second late, slightly off-pitch. Like somebody was playing me back on bad speakers.

I kept moving.

The vending machine nook looked almost normal: machine, round table, three stackable chairs, bulletin board with a flyer—SAFETY MEETING WEDNESDAY 2PM – MANDATORY—no date filled in.

Behind the glass: chips, candy, soda. At first glance.

Then the differences: DORITOS → DORIOTS. SNICKERS → SNICKER. Diet Coke → COLA LIGHT. The Lay’s logo with LAYS’S under it.

The keypad was a single row of 0–9 instead of a grid. The bill slot was just featureless black.

The lower panel hung open. Inside, the metal spirals were braided through each other in impossible loops.

On the floor, six candy bars in a perfect circle, wrappers peeled back. The chocolate was scored with straight intersecting lines like a simple wiring diagram.

I stepped back without realizing it until the table bumped my legs.

My phone buzzed.

I jumped hard enough to drop the flashlight. It hit the floor silently.

Banner: LOW BATTERY — 20%. It had been at 60% when I left the shop. I know it had.

Time: 2:17 a.m.

“Okay,” I said. “No. You’re wrong.”

The machine’s hum cut out. The lights above dimmed a notch.

From farther down the hall, I heard a slow drag. Thick fabric on tile. Something heavy pulling itself.

My mouth went desert-dry.

I snatched up the flashlight, flicked it off, then on again by reflex. The beam swung down the corridor.

At the edge of the light, something passed across the hall.

Not a body. An absence. Light darkened where it moved, dimming the fluorescents beyond it. It slid sideways smoothly, then vanished around a corner.

Like a shadow jumping with no person to cast it.

I turned the flashlight off without thinking. Some old lizard bit of my brain shrieked that light made me too visible.

The hum crept back.

I didn’t go see what it was.

I walked the other way.

The corridors kept changing.

I passed through an unmarked doorway and carpet became mottled linoleum; walls turned glossy white; older square fixtures buzzed overhead. Safety posters popped up: WORK SMART, WASH YOUR HANDS, OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FAMILY, with faces that blurred if I looked too long.

A stretch where every door was CLOSET 1, CLOSET 3, CLOSET 5. All locked.

Around the fifteenth corner I tried marking my path. I slid a torn piece of paper under a door, tied a strip of my blue lanyard around another handle.

Three lefts and a right later, I came to a door with the same lanyard tied on. Same knot. Same frayed ends. Four faint streaks dragged in the paint beside it, ending in neat half-moon erasures.

I left the lanyard. Moving it felt like messing with someone else’s job.

Eventually the hallway blew open into that fake airport.

Ceiling lost in shadow. Big square tiles under me in a pattern that almost looked like a city map. Endless rows of four-seat clusters, vinyl too clean, bolted to the floor.

Gate signs: A1, A3, A5, then B, then AA, AB, AC. Farther letters smeared. Big gray screens overhead glowed blank.

Way across: a wall of glass.

“Outside,” I said. “Has to be.”

I walked toward it.

It never got closer.

No matter how many steps I took, the glass stayed the same distance away. Gate C7 and C8 passed me for the second, third time.

My legs shook. I dropped into a chair. The vinyl didn’t squeak.

Beyond the glass, the world was more of the same—gates, chairs, another glass wall. Like mirrors misaligned.

Then something huge moved across that repetition.

Not a plane. A bulk, a negative space sliding along the concourse beyond. Wherever it went, the gray outside darkened, washed out, then darkened again. The glass vibrated in my spine.

The blank screens glitched. For a second, a line of green pixels tried to spell something—GAT, maybe—but scrambled.

I had to remind myself to breathe.

The thing kept going. No edges, no limbs. Then gone.

I stood up and walked away from the glass.

The restroom was a trap, but not the way you think.

RESTROOMS sign with arrows both ways. I picked one. Beige corridor, heavy door, stick figure with arms bent too high.

Inside, tile, stalls, sinks, mirror. Perfectly clean. No trash, no graffiti.

Seeing myself in the mirror almost felt like waking up. Same tired eyes, same hoodie, same crooked badge.

Then I saw the silhouettes behind me.

Three tall, thin shapes at the far end of the room, in the reflection only. Darker than the rest. No faces. Arms hanging too low.

I didn’t turn around. I just didn’t. Some part of me equated turning with stepping off a roof.

I stared at the mirror and pressed the faucet.

Water arced out. Clear. Real.

In the reflection, it hit the sink and vanished. No splash. No ripple. Just there, then gone.

The silhouettes didn’t move.

I stepped back.

In the mirror, they were closer. One stood right behind my reflection, close enough it could’ve rested its chin on my shoulder if it had a chin.

“Okay,” I whispered.

I stepped forward again. My reflection followed. They stayed.

Up close, the nearest one wasn’t smooth. It was textured, like the side of a building at night. Behind the black, I saw hints of bricks, vents, seams. In its chest, a tiny glowing EXIT sign pulsed backward: TIXE in the glass.

Inside the curve of its shoulder, where bone should’ve been, a miniature hallway ran—carpet, doors, tiny exit signs. Wrong angle to be a reflection of anything behind me.

All the faucets along the sinks were running now. Perfect arcs. No sound.

I turned.

Empty bathroom. Stalls closed. No silhouettes.

The far stall door creaked open. The sound came in torn pieces: squeal, then thump, then hinge noise, all out of order.

That broke me.

I bolted. The door smacked the stopper with a sound my brain refused to process. My shoulder clipped the frame, impact muffled like padding.

Outside, the concourse was gone. Just another low beige hallway.

I didn’t look back.

I found a stairwell next.

Clean green STAIRS sign. Door painted a slightly different beige. It smelled like every hospital stairwell I’ve ever trudged.

Down one flight: landing, big white 3. Down another: 2.

“Good,” I said. “Basement next.”

Down again: 3.

“That’s not funny.”

Back up: 4.

I went up and down, watching the numbers: 3, 2, 3, 4, 2. Different stencil styles, like different people painted them at different times. My heart tried to crawl out of my throat.

I started laughing, high and wrong, the sort of sound you hear yourself make and instantly hate.

“Fine,” I said. “You win.”

I bailed. On the other side of the door, the hall was different. The sign now said STORAGE.

I left stairs alone after that.

Other spaces blurred together: a cafeteria with perfect fake food, fork prongs fused together; a parking level marked P2 where concrete thinned under my foot and the “ceiling” was black glass full of shifting floor plans.

Everywhere I went, I started seeing my own life leaking through. The strip of blue lanyard I’d tied on a door showed up on others. A weird ladder scuff from 3 West reappeared on a wall I’d never seen.

A flyer that used to be blank suddenly had a date written in my handwriting: 10/12.

I don’t remember writing it.

My reflection degraded. Whites of my eyes going gray. Irises losing color. A half-second lag between me and mirror-me. Background sharp, me fuzzy.

My footsteps stayed silent. Clapping sounded like it was happening one floor down.

I don’t think there’s a big moment where something eats you. You just slowly get edited into the background.

The more I saw of the tall things—the Residents—the more they felt like… coworkers.

I watched one “fix” a hallway. Its arm, a cluster of flat pads, pressed to the wall. The surface folded, doors sliding, signs moving, scuffs vanishing. It shifted its hand; the exit sign jumped sides.

It rotated around an axis that shouldn’t exist, and for a second I saw tiny stairwells and waiting rooms inside its chest. Then it was gone, and a red EXIT door glowed where it had been.

It looked exactly like the one outside our mechanical rooms. Same chipped bar, same hinge patina, same scuff in the corner.

Through the glass: St. Alban’s basement. Gray tile, bulletin board with the old Ironman sponsorship flyer Sanchez loves to brag about.

Warm air rolled through the gap.

“If this is real,” I told it, “you’ll have the squeaky tile under the second sprinkler head.”

I hit the bar. The tile on the other side flexed and gave that exact squeaky-wheel feel through my bones.

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Okay. Maybe…”

I stepped through.

The door shut behind me.

When I spun around, it was just cinderblock and paint. Bulletin board, flyer, blank date. No door. No EXIT.

The boiler roar was gone. The air went flat again.

I slid down the wall and, eventually, pulled my phone.

2:17 a.m. Battery: 18%. Wi-Fi gasping at a bar, then nothing.

I opened Notes.

I’ve walked until my legs ache, sat until my head swims, walked again. Time means nothing. My phone insists it’s still 2:17.

The lobby I’m in now has walls covered in black-and-white photos. Empty streets, overpasses, stairwells, loading docks. No people, no cars. In every photo, somewhere, a door.

I’ve been playing a messed-up Where’s Waldo with them while I type.

One is the old admin corridor. I can see the “COMMUNITY” print and the dent in the baseboard where Kyle dropped a tank and pretended he didn’t. I’m 90% sure it’s the same dent, anyway.

In that picture, the SERVICE door at the end is closed.

There’s a tall, narrow shadow behind the wired glass.

The photo next to it is a stairwell landing with a painted 3. My shadow is there mid-step, blurred, one foot off the ground.

I don’t remember anyone taking it.

My battery icon hasn’t moved. Still 18%. Time still 2:17. The Wi-Fi symbol keeps flashing like it wants to show something, then gives up.

Something’s moving in the corridor outside. That same drag of heavy fabric and deeper groans, like metal under stress. The photos nearest the corner vibrate in their frames.

I don’t think the Residents are hunting me. They’re just… doing whatever their version of a job is. Punching a clock somewhere I can’t see. I’m the glitch.

Feels like everything gets dumped on maintenance eventually, one way or another. Floors, walls, systems… people. We’re the catch-all folder.

If this Note somehow leaks out—if whatever passes for network traffic in here spills into yours—maybe it’ll help someone.

If you work nights, if you’ve ever been last out of a building, if you’ve ever walked down a back hallway and thought it felt a little too long, or the air was too still, listen.

When you see a door you’ve never seen before in a hallway you know by heart, don’t open it “just to see.”

When exit signs point both ways to the same room numbers, turn around. Go toward noise.

If you walk down a corridor and your footsteps don’t make any sound at all, don’t be a hero and take another step “just to see.” Look for your mess: the ladder scuff you made last winter, the coffee stain nobody cleaned, the burned-out bulb you keep meaning to replace. If they’re not there, if everything looks freshly installed and wrong, back up until the world looks worn again.

If you find a vending machine where all the brand names are off by one letter, just keep walking. You don’t need a bag of DORIOTS that badly, I promise.

If you walk into a bathroom and every faucet’s already running and the water doesn’t move when it hits the sink, get out. Don’t check the mirror. Seriously. Just don’t.

And if you ever see a tall, thin shadow at the end of a hallway that your eyes keep sliding off, like a blind spot—

—don’t call out to it for help.

Because it might hear you.

And it might try to help, in the only way it knows how:

by making room.

The air in this lobby is thicker now. The ceiling’s climbed higher; the corners are lost in shadow. Some of the photos have changed—one empty street now has a St. Alban’s sign way in the background.

The hum in the walls is getting deeper. Less HVAC, more construction. Like cranes and concrete shifting somewhere just behind the drywall.

I know a little more now than when I first panicked at that EXIT door. Enough to maybe nudge things for whoever ignores all this and stumbles in anyway. A hallway that doesn’t fold under your feet. An exit sign that actually points somewhere better.

I’ll be the one smoothing walls you never see, pressing too many fingers into the paint and sliding doors a few inches this way or that.

Until then, do me a favor.

Stay in the loud parts of the world. Doors slamming, carts squeaking, somebody complaining the coffee tastes like mud. That’s the good stuff. That means you’re still in the real layers.

And if admitting calls you at 1 a.m. about a flickering light in a wing nobody uses anymore, grab a ladder if you have to.

Just do me one favor and leave the door that says SERVICE alone.

Gate signs: A1, A3, A5, then B, then AA, AB, AC. Farther letters smeared. Big gray screens overhead glowed blank.

Way across: a wall of glass.

“Outside,” I said. “Has to be.”

I walked toward it.

It never got closer.

No matter how many steps I took, the glass stayed the same distance away. Gate C7 and C8 passed me for the second, third time.

My legs shook. I dropped into a chair. The vinyl didn’t squeak.

Beyond the glass, the world was more of the same—gates, chairs, another glass wall. Like mirrors misaligned.

Then something huge moved across that repetition.

Not a plane. A bulk, a negative space sliding along the concourse beyond. Wherever it went, the gray outside darkened, washed out, then darkened again. The glass vibrated in my spine.

The blank screens glitched. For a second, a line of green pixels tried to spell something—GAT, maybe—but scrambled.

I had to remind myself to breathe.

The thing kept going. No edges, no limbs. Then gone.

I stood up and walked away from the glass.

The restroom was a trap, but not the way you think.

RESTROOMS sign with arrows both ways. I picked one. Beige corridor, heavy door, stick figure with arms bent too high.

Inside, tile, stalls, sinks, mirror. Perfectly clean. No trash, no graffiti.

Seeing myself in the mirror almost felt like waking up. Same tired eyes, same hoodie, same crooked badge.

Then I saw the silhouettes behind me.

Three tall, thin shapes at the far end of the room, in the reflection only. Darker than the rest. No faces. Arms hanging too low.

I didn’t turn around. I just didn’t. Some part of me equated turning with stepping off a roof.

I stared at the mirror and pressed the faucet.

Water arced out. Clear. Real.

In the reflection, it hit the sink and vanished. No splash. No ripple. Just there, then gone.

The silhouettes didn’t move.

I stepped back.

In the mirror, they were closer. One stood right behind my reflection, close enough it could’ve rested its chin on my shoulder if it had a chin.

“Okay,” I whispered.

I stepped forward again. My reflection followed. They stayed.

Up close, the nearest one wasn’t smooth. It was textured, like the side of a building at night. Behind the black, I saw hints of bricks, vents, seams. In its chest, a tiny glowing EXIT sign pulsed backward: TIXE in the glass.

Inside the curve of its shoulder, where bone should’ve been, a miniature hallway ran—carpet, doors, tiny exit signs. Wrong angle to be a reflection of anything behind me.

All the faucets along the sinks were running now. Perfect arcs. No sound.

I turned.

Empty bathroom. Stalls closed. No silhouettes.

The far stall door creaked open. The sound came in torn pieces: squeal, then thump, then hinge noise, all out of order.

That broke me.

I bolted. The door smacked the stopper with a sound my brain refused to process. My shoulder clipped the frame, impact muffled like padding.

Outside, the concourse was gone. Just another low beige hallway.

I didn’t look back.

I found a stairwell next.

Clean green STAIRS sign. Door painted a slightly different beige. It smelled like every hospital stairwell I’ve ever trudged.

Down one flight: landing, big white 3. Down another: 2.

“Good,” I said. “Basement next.”

Down again: 3.

“That’s not funny.”

Back up: 4.

I went up and down, watching the numbers: 3, 2, 3, 4, 2. Different stencil styles, like different people painted them at different times. My heart tried to crawl out of my throat.

I started laughing, high and wrong, the sort of sound you hear yourself make and instantly hate.

“Fine,” I said. “You win.”

I bailed. On the other side of the door, the hall was different. The sign now said STORAGE.

I left stairs alone after that.

Other spaces blurred together: a cafeteria with perfect fake food, fork prongs fused together; a parking level marked P2 where concrete thinned under my foot and the “ceiling” was black glass full of shifting floor plans.

Everywhere I went, I started seeing my own life leaking through. The strip of blue lanyard I’d tied on a door showed up on others. A weird ladder scuff from 3 West reappeared on a wall I’d never seen.

A flyer that used to be blank suddenly had a date written in my handwriting: 10/12.

I don’t remember writing it.

My reflection degraded. Whites of my eyes going gray. Irises losing color. A half-second lag between me and mirror-me. Background sharp, me fuzzy.

My footsteps stayed silent. Clapping sounded like it was happening one floor down.

I don’t think there’s a big moment where something eats you. You just slowly get edited into the background.

The more I saw of the tall things—the Residents—the more they felt like… coworkers.

I watched one “fix” a hallway. Its arm, a cluster of flat pads, pressed to the wall. The surface folded, doors sliding, signs moving, scuffs vanishing. It shifted its hand; the exit sign jumped sides.

It rotated around an axis that shouldn’t exist, and for a second I saw tiny stairwells and waiting rooms inside its chest. Then it was gone, and a red EXIT door glowed where it had been.

It looked exactly like the one outside our mechanical rooms. Same chipped bar, same hinge patina, same scuff in the corner.

Through the glass: St. Alban’s basement. Gray tile, bulletin board with the old Ironman sponsorship flyer Sanchez loves to brag about.

Warm air rolled through the gap.

“If this is real,” I told it, “you’ll have the squeaky tile under the second sprinkler head.”

I hit the bar. The tile on the other side flexed and gave that exact squeaky-wheel feel through my bones.

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Okay. Maybe…”

I stepped through.

The door shut behind me.

When I spun around, it was just cinderblock and paint. Bulletin board, flyer, blank date. No door. No EXIT.

The boiler roar was gone. The air went flat again.

I slid down the wall and, eventually, pulled my phone.

2:17 a.m. Battery: 18%. Wi-Fi gasping at a bar, then nothing.

I opened Notes.

I’ve walked until my legs ache, sat until my head swims, walked again. Time means nothing. My phone insists it’s still 2:17.

The lobby I’m in now has walls covered in black-and-white photos. Empty streets, overpasses, stairwells, loading docks. No people, no cars. In every photo, somewhere, a door.

I’ve been playing a messed-up Where’s Waldo with them while I type.

One is the old admin corridor. I can see the “COMMUNITY” print and the dent in the baseboard where Kyle dropped a tank and pretended he didn’t. I’m 90% sure it’s the same dent, anyway.

In that picture, the SERVICE door at the end is closed.

There’s a tall, narrow shadow behind the wired glass.

The photo next to it is a stairwell landing with a painted 3. My shadow is there mid-step, blurred, one foot off the ground.

I don’t remember anyone taking it.

My battery icon hasn’t moved. Still 18%. Time still 2:17. The Wi-Fi symbol keeps flashing like it wants to show something, then gives up.

Something’s moving in the corridor outside. That same drag of heavy fabric and deeper groans, like metal under stress. The photos nearest the corner vibrate in their frames.

I don’t think the Residents are hunting me. They’re just… doing whatever their version of a job is. Punching a clock somewhere I can’t see. I’m the glitch.

Feels like everything gets dumped on maintenance eventually, one way or another. Floors, walls, systems… people. We’re the catch-all folder.

If this Note somehow leaks out—if whatever passes for network traffic in here spills into yours—maybe it’ll help someone.

If you work nights, if you’ve ever been last out of a building, if you’ve ever walked down a back hallway and thought it felt a little too long, or the air was too still, listen.

When you see a door you’ve never seen before in a hallway you know by heart, don’t open it “just to see.”

When exit signs point both ways to the same room numbers, turn around. Go toward noise.

If you walk down a corridor and your footsteps don’t make any sound at all, don’t be a hero and take another step “just to see.” Look for your mess: the ladder scuff you made last winter, the coffee stain nobody cleaned, the burned-out bulb you keep meaning to replace. If they’re not there, if everything looks freshly installed and wrong, back up until the world looks worn again.

If you find a vending machine where all the brand names are off by one letter, just keep walking. You don’t need a bag of DORIOTS that badly, I promise.

If you walk into a bathroom and every faucet’s already running and the water doesn’t move when it hits the sink, get out. Don’t check the mirror. Seriously. Just don’t.

And if you ever see a tall, thin shadow at the end of a hallway that your eyes keep sliding off, like a blind spot—

—don’t call out to it for help.

Because it might hear you.

And it might try to help, in the only way it knows how:

by making room.

The air in this lobby is thicker now. The ceiling’s climbed higher; the corners are lost in shadow. Some of the photos have changed—one empty street now has a St. Alban’s sign way in the background.

The hum in the walls is getting deeper. Less HVAC, more construction. Like cranes and concrete shifting somewhere just behind the drywall.

I know a little more now than when I first panicked at that EXIT door. Enough to maybe nudge things for whoever ignores all this and stumbles in anyway. A hallway that doesn’t fold under your feet. An exit sign that actually points somewhere better.

I’ll be the one smoothing walls you never see, pressing too many fingers into the paint and sliding doors a few inches this way or that.

Until then, do me a favor.

Stay in the loud parts of the world. Doors slamming, carts squeaking, somebody complaining the coffee tastes like mud. That’s the good stuff. That means you’re still in the real layers.

And if admitting calls you at 1 a.m. about a flickering light in a wing nobody uses anymore, grab a ladder if you have to.

Just do me one favor and leave the door that says SERVICE alone.

I’m just dumping it into Notes because it’s the only app that still opens right now, and the battery icon’s been stuck at 18% for… I don’t know, a while. Long enough that I’m starting to hate that number. The time in the corner says 2:17 a.m. and hasn’t moved.

If this ever pops up on somebody’s screen and it just reads like some guy falling apart, that’s… yeah, that’s probably accurate. I’m not going to pretend I’ve got this under control. But if you’re the kind of person who wanders into stairwells with no signage “just to see where they go,” I need you to read this all the way through.

And then I need you not to be that person.

I work nights in building maintenance at St. Alban’s Medical Center in Phoenix. Technically, my badge says “Building Systems Technician II,” which sounds like I should have a lab coat, but in reality I still plunge toilets and un-jam automatic doors.

St. Alban’s is one of those hospitals you drive past on 7th Street near the 202 and don’t really notice. Beige concrete, mirrored windows, sad little shrubs that die every summer and get replaced every winter.

I’m thirty–four—wait, no, I had a birthday in June. Thirty–five.
My brain keeps defaulting to thirty–four like it’s trying to save me one year on the wear-and-tear.

Night shift is usually quiet. A couple nurses, one ER doc, a sleepy security guard. The building settles into this constant background noise: HVAC, ice machines, telemetry alarms, wheels on linoleum. It all turns into one low hum. You don’t notice it until it stops.

The night this started, I was covering for Kyle, who called out “sick” but I’d bet a week’s pay it was because the Coyotes had a late game. Midnight to eight. I grabbed a cup of cafeteria coffe before they shut down at eleven. It already tasted like the pot was on its second day.

Around one, my radio crackled.

“Facilities, this is admitting,” Rojas said. “We’ve got a flickering light in the old admin corridor. It’s giving Mrs. Harvey a migraine.”

“Copy,” I said. “I’ll head up.”

The “old admin corridor” is the forgotten wing on three that used to have HR and billing before they moved everything downstairs and half-online. Now it’s dusty records, empty offices, and people who don’t want to be found.

I grabbed a ladder, a spare 2x4 LED troffer, my tool bag, logged it, and took the service elevator up.

The doors opened onto a dim hallway. Motion-sensor lights clicked up as I walked: hoodie, scuffed boots, badge with a curling “HAPPY 35” post-it.

The bad light was easy to spot—one panel twitching bright/dim/off like it couldn’t pick a setting. I set the ladder up, climbed, and popped the diffuser.

The plenum above should’ve been a throatful of sound: air handlers, duct noise. It was still. Cooler, too, just enough to raise the hair on my arm.

The LED panel looked fine. Wiring solid, no heat marks. The sticker on the back, though:

LITHONIA LIGHTING 2G7 2X4 TROFFER 4000K.

We use 2GT8s. I’ve written that model number so many times my hand could do it alone.

“Sure,” I muttered. “Typos all the way up the chain.”

I gave a tired little laugh.

Then everything turned off.

Not just the light. The building.

HVAC roar, ICU beeps, distant traffic—gone. My ears rang in the vacuum.

The panel flared once and died.

The corridor dropped into solid black so fast my stomach lurched. I grabbed the ladder.

My flashlight was on my belt. I fumbled it out and clicked it on.

The old admin corridor was still there.

Sort of.

Same beige walls, same brown handrail, same desert print with “COMMUNITY” under it. But the hallway was longer, stretched. More doors than there should’ve been, like someone copy-pasted a few extra. The far end sat too far away.

“What the hell,” I said. Hearing my voice helped.

I climbed down. My boots hit the carpet with no sound.

That, more than anything, made my skin crawl.

I turned to where the elevator lobby should’ve been.

Gone.

Fifteen feet away: a beige wall with a red EXIT door and glowing green sign.

I turned the other way.

Same thing. Red EXIT door. No elevators. No stairwell. Just two outs that hadn’t existed a minute before.

I walked to the nearest door. Through the wired glass, I saw another hallway: same carpet, same doors, fluorescents buzzing.

“Breaker tripped,” I told myself. “Weird re-route. Old prints. Whatever.”

I hit the bar.

The door swung open. When it shut behind me, it sounded thin, like a fridge door.

I turned immediately to wedge it open.

Drywall.

No door. No EXIT sign. Just a blank wall and an empty extinguisher cabinet.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope nope nope.”

The hallway could’ve been any back-of-house corridor. Low-pile carpet, handrails, metal doors: 317, 319, 321. The number plates leaned a little, like whoever stuck them on did it fast.

I tried a handle. Locked. Another. Locked.

The wall clocks were the same cheap black-rimmed model we use, but all of them showed 2:22. Second hands frozen.

My phone still said 2:17.

I hit a T-junction with an overhead sign:

← 300–312
→ 300–312

I picked left.

The smell shifted to faint chlorine, like a drained indoor pool. My footsteps made zero sound. I stomped once; the silence stayed.

“Hello?” I called.

My voice echoed back a half-second late, slightly off-pitch. Like somebody was playing me back on bad speakers.

I kept moving.

The vending machine nook looked almost normal: machine, round table, three stackable chairs, bulletin board with a flyer—SAFETY MEETING WEDNESDAY 2PM – MANDATORY—no date filled in.

Behind the glass: chips, candy, soda. At first glance.

Then the differences: DORITOS → DORIOTS. SNICKERS → SNICKER. Diet Coke → COLA LIGHT. The Lay’s logo with LAYS’S under it.

The keypad was a single row of 0–9 instead of a grid. The bill slot was just featureless black.

The lower panel hung open. Inside, the metal spirals were braided through each other in impossible loops.

On the floor, six candy bars in a perfect circle, wrappers peeled back. The chocolate was scored with straight intersecting lines like a simple wiring diagram.

I stepped back without realizing it until the table bumped my legs.

My phone buzzed.

I jumped hard enough to drop the flashlight. It hit the floor silently.

Banner: LOW BATTERY — 20%. It had been at 60% when I left the shop. I know it had.

Time: 2:17 a.m.

“Okay,” I said. “No. You’re wrong.”

The machine’s hum cut out. The lights above dimmed a notch.

From farther down the hall, I heard a slow drag. Thick fabric on tile. Something heavy pulling itself.

My mouth went desert-dry.

I snatched up the flashlight, flicked it off, then on again by reflex. The beam swung down the corridor.

At the edge of the light, something passed across the hall.

Not a body. An absence. Light darkened where it moved, dimming the fluorescents beyond it. It slid sideways smoothly, then vanished around a corner.

Like a shadow jumping with no person to cast it.

I turned the flashlight off without thinking. Some old lizard bit of my brain shrieked that light made me too visible.

The hum crept back.

I didn’t go see what it was.

I walked the other way.

The corridors kept changing.

I passed through an unmarked doorway and carpet became mottled linoleum; walls turned glossy white; older square fixtures buzzed overhead. Safety posters popped up: WORK SMART, WASH YOUR HANDS, OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FAMILY, with faces that blurred if I looked too long.

A stretch where every door was CLOSET 1, CLOSET 3, CLOSET 5. All locked.

Around the fifteenth corner I tried marking my path. I slid a torn piece of paper under a door, tied a strip of my blue lanyard around another handle.

Three lefts and a right later, I came to a door with the same lanyard tied on. Same knot. Same frayed ends. Four faint streaks dragged in the paint beside it, ending in neat half-moon erasures.

I left the lanyard. Moving it felt like messing with someone else’s job.

Eventually the hallway blew open into that fake airport.

Ceiling lost in shadow. Big square tiles under me in a pattern that almost looked like a city map. Endless rows of four-seat clusters, vinyl too clean, bolted to the floor.

Gate signs: A1, A3, A5, then B, then AA, AB, AC. Farther letters smeared. Big gray screens overhead glowed blank.

Way across: a wall of glass.

“Outside,” I said. “Has to be.”

I walked toward it.

It never got closer.

No matter how many steps I took, the glass stayed the same distance away. Gate C7 and C8 passed me for the second, third time.

My legs shook. I dropped into a chair. The vinyl didn’t squeak.

Beyond the glass, the world was more of the same—gates, chairs, another glass wall. Like mirrors misaligned.

I was willing to make it work but he didn't seem like he knew how to/ was in denial until I broke up up with him the week before I moved away.

It's been months since the breakup. Finally started a long term no contact period, it's been a couple weeks.

I'm just still so sad, I wish we had more time together as lovers. I miss him so much. He seems so unbothered, just busy as ever and has strong will to never reach out to me or give me any indication that he is sad about what he had being over.

It hurts so much. I really loved him so much.

1oopufw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1oopufw/books_help_you_become_the_person_you_keep/,"Books help you become the person you keep imagining, but only if you read the right ones.","Lately, I’ve been hearing the same thing from a lot of people around me: “I want to grow, I just don’t know where to start,” or “I keep saving videos but never actually change anything.” It's like we’re addicted to the idea of self-improvement, but allergic to real momentum. And let’s be honest, a lot of those 30-second TikTok “productivity hacks” or pop psychology reels are just dopamine candy made by people who haven’t read a single book on neuroscience, habit change, or behavioral economics.

So here’s what this post is about: a hard-hitting, no BS guide to reading better, learning smarter, and becoming the person you keep imagining. More confident, more focused, more grounded. Not through vague affirmations or life coach platitudes, but through real, science-backed, soul-shaking knowledge. Pulled from PhD-level research, timeless books, and podcasts where the guests actually invented the fields the TikTok bros quote wrong every day.

Let’s get into it.

1. Read like your mental health depends on it  
Books aren’t just for learning more. They literally change your brain. A study from Emory University (Berns et al., 2013) found that reading fiction improves neural connectivity, especially in the default mode network, the area linked to self-concept and introspection. Translation: reading builds the muscle to emotionally process your life, not just escape it. Even 6 minutes of daily reading can reduce stress by 68% according to a University of Sussex study. Why are we ignoring this mental gym?

2. Choose books that hit like a therapy session and a punch in the gut  
Some books don’t just give knowledge, they rewire you. If you want one that will absolutely mess with your mind in the best way:

**“The Mountain Is You” by Brianna Wiest**  
This book will make you question every hidden way you sabotage yourself. Wiest (author of multiple bestsellers on emotional intelligence and trauma patterns) combines clinical psych with brutal self-reflection. She unpacks patterns like procrastination, burnout, and emotional numbness not as flaws, but as misfiring survival strategies. It broke me open the first time I read it. This is the best book I’ve ever read for understanding why you don’t actually do the things you say you want to.

3. Try to make learning addictive  
Raw discipline fades. What works? Curiosity loops. That’s why gamified learning apps are underrated.  

**I recommend checking out this app: Shortform**  
It has ultra-detailed book guides (with diagrams, breakdowns, and exercises) for bestsellers like “Atomic Habits,” “Deep Work,” or anything by Malcolm Gladwell. It doesn’t just summarize, it connects each idea to you. You retain more, think deeper, and stay engaged longer. If you have 20 minutes a day, this app will multiply what you get out of any book. And you don’t need to finish everything. Even one idea, well understood, beats 10 vague blog posts.

4. Turn your commute into a masterclass  
**Podcast tip: Huberman Lab**  
Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman isn’t just another brain bro. He’s a tenured Stanford professor breaking down real science on motivation, focus, dopamine, and behavior change. Episode rec: “How to Increase Motivation & Drive” explains how dopamine actually works and how to control it like a system, not a mystery. Big wake-up call if motivation feels random for you.

**Bonus podcast: The Tim Ferriss Show**  
He interviews high-performers across every field, authors, scientists, athletes. But the gold is in how he extracts their routines, books, mental models. You’ll come away with at least 10 book recs, 5 mindset shifts, and 3 new habits per episode.

5. Go low-stimulation in high-distraction environments  
If your brain is fried from scrolling, traditional reading might feel painful at first. That’s fine. Adapt.

**BeFreed**  
This app is for people who want to absorb serious knowledge but can’t sit through 300 pages with zero context. It’s built by a team from Columbia University, and it turns books, expert talks, and deep-dive research into audio episodes personalized to your goals. You choose the tone, voice, and even the length: 10, 20, or 40 minutes depending on how deep you want to go. But the real magic is this: it learns from how you listen and builds you a hyper-personalized study plan. It’s scary good at surfacing the right insight when you need it. And yeah, it has every book and concept I’ve mentioned in this post.

6. Use YouTube like a university, not a treadmill  
**Check out: The School of Life**  
Their animations on topics like loneliness, ambition, and emotional maturity are short but profound. Alain de Botton’s team turns existential dread into clarity. Way better than getting lost in a feed of gym vloggers and clickbait gurus.

**Also: Big Think**  
Top-tier experts explain psychology, neuroscience, economics, all in under 10 minutes. They brought on names like Dan Ariely (behavioral econ), Esther Perel (relationships), and Robert Greene (power). If you want to think clearer and deeper, this is gold.

7. Stack your habits around your learning  
James Clear (in his bestselling book “Atomic Habits”) showed that environment is what drives consistency. So stash your Kindle on your coffee machine, listen to podcasts while walking, or set a “reading hour” right after lunch. Make the habit automatic. Reinforcement beats motivation. Every time.

8. Read one idea, apply one idea  
Don’t just highlight quotes. Pick one idea per week and test it IRL. Like “temptation bundling” from behavioral scientist Katy Milkman: pair something you enjoy with something productive. Audiobooks + chores. Podcasts + gym. That’s how change sticks.

9. Don’t hoard knowledge, build feedback loops  
Write it down. Discuss it. Share it. Research from Harvard Business School (Di Stefano et al., 2014) shows that people who take 15 minutes to reflect on what they’ve learned perform 23% better. So journal it. Or post your reflections. Or just text a friend like, “Yo this one thing I learned today changed everything.”

10. The person you imagine is built one book, one breakthrough, one bold application at a time  
You’re not lazy. You’re overloaded. But knowledge isn’t useful unless it’s distilled, digested, and lived. These tools and ideas can help you do just that in less time, with more impact, and with less shame-driven hustle.

You’re not made by scrolling. You’re made by what you return to. So if you’re going to obsess over self-improvement, do it with real tools and better sources. Always.",1,1762306484.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

1oops7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1oops7m/full_circle_moment/,Full circle moment!,"3.5 months ago, I was on a work trip when I got a call from my NP’s office letting me know my A1c was prediabetic (5.9%). Alone in a hotel room, I panicked, broke down into tears, and hysterically scrolled this subreddit. I was convinced my life was over and it would never be the same. Posts in this group encouraged me that reversing the condition was possible, so I made a promise to myself to at least try to make a change.

Well, today, in another hotel room on another work trip, I got results back from an updated blood test. A1c is now 5.6% (yay!) and I intend to keep going to drop it even further. Feeling very proud and optimistic about the road to come!

Here’s what worked for me:
-Losing weight: I made a goal of losing 50 lbs. I’m eating ~1900 cal per day which is about a 900 cal deficit for me. 3.5 months later I’m just shy of 20 lbs lost! I feel so much better. 
-Tracking everything I eat: I use LoseIt and track everything I eat, every day. I try to hit my goal every day but don’t panic if I go over.
-Switch to whole foods, less takeout, more fiber & protein and less sugar & carbs. I make intentional swaps, like zero sugar coffee creamer or halo top instead of Ben & Jerry’s. I keep high protein low cal treats like skinny dipped almonds or chocolate protein bars as easy snacks. I try to follow the pairing method to pair carbs with fiber and protein. 
-Add in exercise: I do 2-3x simple strength training workouts per week while watching TV, Pilates once a week, and recreational sports 1-3x per week. I try to prioritize feeling strong. 
-Being transparent with my partner: I cook the meals in my house & my partner is a real meat and potatoes guy. I told him why I needed to change my habits & asked him to help. He doesn’t offer me his snacks anymore and he encourages me all the time (and puts up a minimal fuss over healthy dinners!)

A typical day of eating for me:
Breakfast: Light & fit yogurt with protein granola, berries, protein shake w/ espresso
Lunch: Bagged salad with light dressing, chicken nuggets
Snacks: Protein bar, skinny dipped almonds
Dinner: Thai veggie bowl (1/2 serving ramen, rotisserie chicken, lots of mixed veggies, peanut sauce)
Dessert: Joyride candy, HaloTop, or diet soda

Other tips I’ve found handy are keeping easy high protein low carb meals like turkey breast + cottage cheese + raw veggies handy for when I’m hungry or need a low cal meal. I also still let myself have takeout, but try to make low carb swaps (e.g. at dinner tonight I ordered chicken, but swapped the side pasta for roasted veg).

If you’re in the same boat as me - you can do it!

1oops37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oops37/my_life_if_falling_apart_for_not_apparent_reason/,My life if falling apart for not apparent reason,"**Background**:

I'm 41F living in the Midwest US. I never had any major health problems, no surgeries. I regularly menstruate, don't take any meds other than multivitamin, D and B12, and melatonin.

My iron and ferritin levels are in normal range, B12 blood elevated (as it should, I'm supplementing aggressively), all other blood work is in normal ranges. Thyroid hormones in normal range too.

I sleep 8 to 8.5h a day, I live very (boring) regular life. I sleep well with 0.3mg melatonin.

I work out almost daily, low intensity cardio for half an hour. I have no back pain typical for friends my age. I had normal weight my entire life, BMI 21.5 steadily maintained.

I don't drink alcohol, don't use any drugs other than caffeine.

**Problem:**

Almost every day I wake up bright and energized. Mid-morning I get terrible brain fog that lasts through most of the day. In the late afternoon I recover mental clarity for couple of hours, until regular evening tiredness (different than brain fog) sets in.

The brain fog feels like trying to think on underpowered RAM. I'm aware of my limitations, which makes it worse. I just want to sit still and stare at the wall.

This has been going on for probably a decade. I'm powering through by doing most of my work in the evening hours, which of course screws up my private life. To keep my job and life together, I have to make use of the limited hours of brain power that I have.

I can't go on like that. I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers, with days spent in brain fogged haze and cramming all life and work into the few hours every day when my neurons seem to be capable of firing.

I can't find any information about similar symptoms.

Caffeine works at keeping me awake, but not smart - if that makes any sense. When brain fog sets in, if I don't have caffeine, I would just nap. If I do have coffee or strong tea, I am awake, but still dumb.

**I tried:**

\- quitting coffee: it was, predictably, very hard at first, then got back to baseline after few weeks, no change on the brain fog cycle.

\- I tried keto diet, supposedly it should give mental clarity... I was on strict keto for 6 months, it did not make a difference. I lost few pounds of water weight but since I had no weight loss goals, I had to force myself to eat enough to maintain weight. No promised mental clarity.

\- blue light in the morning, I tried special circadian rhythm glasses (wavelength shown in mouse studies to stimulate the right bunch of neurons in the right way, regulate circadian rhythm). No effect. I know those glasses help with jetlag, but the light does nothing for my baseline problem of daily brain fog.

\- I brought my concerns to two primary doctors. Both run bloodwork, said maybe I need more rests? Basically dismissed it.

My concerns are easy to dismiss because on the surface I'm successful professionally. I don't get nearly as much done as I would like to, and my private life suffers, but I manage to get by enough to look like I have it together. My blood tests are perfect, I don't look sick.

\- over the years, I experimented with many supplements, giving it several months each time to take effect. I tried, among other things, creatine, methylation supplements, oxaloacetate, acetyl carnitine, theanine, sulbutiamine, few racetams. Nothing made significant difference. With some, especially the well known nootropics, I felt maybe some increase in alertness and ability to concentrate, but nothing helped with the cyclic brain fog.

**I do NOT have:**

\- chronic fatigue syndrome. I don't get the ""post exertional malaise"" and crashes described as diagnostic criteria

\- POTS, I don't have dizyness or heart rate symptoms

\- thyroid function is normal

\- no sleep apnea

\- I'm not depressed. Despite this daily struggle that makes me want to cry, I don't have anhedonia or other symptoms, at least when I take the tests when my brain is on line.

I realize asking Reddit for advice is desperate, but I am desperate. I don't have constant brain fog, that could be explained by some undiagnosed deficiency or illness. I do get those few hours most days when I can see what my life could be if my brain functioned properly.

I would really appreciate if you can point me in any direction. Other blood tests I should do? supplements or meds to try? Please help. I will be incredibly grateful for any ideas.

# Story 1: Crash and the Mini Wumpa Pies

**Location: Woompkis, GA**  
**Date: May 22nd, 2020**

The sun baked the parking lot of Wolmart Super-center, making the air shimmer above the blacktop as Crash Bandicoot and his sister Coco hopped out of their battered van. The vehicle was covered in stickers fruits, quantum masks, and a faded “Save the Wumpa Trees” decal. Crash adjusted his shorts and spun in a quick circle, his excitement barely contained.

Coco, with her ever-present laptop bag slung over her shoulder, rolled her eyes affectionately. “Crash, we’re here for snacks. Not a dance-off.”

He grinned and pantomimed a quick jig anyway, attracting a few stares. Woompkis, Georgia wasn’t used to marsupials in shoes, even in Reality #3367, where oddities were just a Tuesday.

Inside, Wolmart’s fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The shelves were stocked with every conceivable snack, from Choco-Mutant Bars to the infamous “Gnarly Nougat.” But Crash’s eyes were drawn to a new display: **Mini Wumpa Pies**, boasting “Exclusive Flavors!” Each box featured a cartoon Wumpa fruit, winking mischievously.

Crash grabbed one of each: Wumpa Berry, Mango Madness, Jalapeno Wumpa, and the mysterious “Midnight Surprise.” He eyed the sign: “Rollback Only $1.99 a box!”

Coco wrinkled her nose at the Jalapeño flavor. “Maybe stick with the fruit ones, Crash. We don’t want a repeat of the Chili Cheese Fiasco.”

But Crash was already at the self-checkout, tapping his foot impatiently. Minutes later, they sat at the back of the van, the boxes spread out like treasure.

Coco set her phone to record. “Crash Bandicoot’s Snack Review, episode 37. Go!”



Crash tore into the Wumpa Berry Pie, stuffing the miniature pastry in his mouth. His face lit up. “Mmm!” he managed, giving two thumbs up.

Mango Madness got a similar reaction, though he made a face as if the tartness surprised him. Jalapeño Wumpa was next. He bit in, chewed, then froze.

Coco leaned forward. “Crash?”



He coughed, steam practically coming out of his ears. He danced in circles, flapping his arms. “Hot! Hot! Hot!”

Coco laughed, but quickly handed him a bottle of Wumpa Juice. Crash recovered, then eyed the last pie: Midnight Surprise.

“Do you really want to?” Coco asked, but Crash shrugged and tore open the wrapper. The pie was inky black, with glittery sugar on top. He took a tentative bite.

At first, nothing. Then, Crash’s face paled. He dropped the pie, clutching his stomach. “Ugh…”

Coco’s laughter turned to concern as Crash slumped against the van. His fur seemed to lose a shade of vibrancy. “Crash? Crash!”



From the shadows, a familiar wooden mask floated into view. Aku Aku’s eyes glowed with ancient wisdom. “What has happened, Coco?”

“He ate the… that pie. Midnight Surprise. He’s sick!”

Aku Aku hovered over Crash, chanting in a language older than the Wumpa Islands. A gentle green glow surrounded Crash, and he slowly sat up, his color returning.

“Thank you, Aku Aku,” Coco said, relieved.



Crash groaned. “No more Midnight Surprise,” he muttered, rubbing his belly.

Aku Aku regarded the discarded pie. “Some things are not meant for consumption, Crash. Next time, listen to your sister.”

Coco grinned. “Told you.”

Crash managed a sheepish smile as Coco ended the recording. “That’s a wrap for today’s Snack Review. Final verdict: Stick to the classics, and always have Aku Aku on speed dial.”

The siblings packed up, leaving the remaining pies for the seagulls who, wisely, left the Midnight Surprise untouched.

# Story 2: RIP Freddie Cortex

**Location: N. Sanity Isles, then Coast City**

Dr. Neo Cortex was accustomed to bad news. After all, he had failed to conquer the world more times than he could count. But the message blinking on his holo-tablet made his hands tremble.

>

Freddie. His brother. The one Cortex rarely spoke of, the one family member he hadn’t written off yet never quite understood. Cortex’s mind raced with old images: two boys building toy robots, Freddie’s quiet laugh, the way his eyes always seemed to see through Neo’s bluster.

Cortex booked a flight at once, hopping onto his personal jet, the “Evilution One.” He spent the hours brooding, staring out at the clouds as his minion N. Gin piloted.

Coast City was gray and rainy, the kind of weather Cortex felt in his bones. At the apartment, police tape fluttered in the wind. A detective, Officer Sloane, met him at the door.

“Dr. Cortex?” she asked, studying him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. “You’re here about your brother?”

Cortex nodded, showing rare vulnerability. “Yes. What happened?”

Sloane led him inside. The apartment was cramped but tidy, filled with books on quantum mechanics and shelves of model trains. Freddie’s favorite. Cortex felt a pang.



“We found him two days ago,” Sloane said, her tone gentle. “No signs of forced entry or struggle. But…” She hesitated, then showed him a small device on the coffee table. Cortex recognized it instantly: a prototype mind-control chip he’d developed years ago, but had abandoned.

Sloane continued, “There were traces of neural disruption. We think someone used it on him then sabotaged it, causing… fatal feedback.”

Cortex’s fists clenched. “Who would do this?”

“We were hoping you could tell us,” Sloane said, watching him closely.

Cortex closed his eyes. He thought of rivals, past experiments, grudges so many enemies. But who would target Freddie, who had never harmed anyone?



He wandered the apartment, looking for clues. On Freddie’s desk, he found a note:

>

Cortex’s vision blurred. For the first time in years, he let himself cry.

But he was Cortex, and grief quickly became resolve. “Whoever did this,” he vowed, voice cold as steel, “will answer to me.”

Days of investigation followed. Cortex worked with Sloane, hacking into surveillance, interrogating old contacts. The trail led to a shadowy figure an ex-associate named Dr. Verity, who once worked for Cortex but was fired for “insufficient evil.”

Verity had held a grudge, blaming Cortex for her failures. She had tried to duplicate his mind-control tech, but it backfired on Freddie, who’d come to warn her to stop.

Cortex confronted Verity in her laboratory. There was no dramatic battle just words, cold and cutting.

“He was innocent,” Cortex spat, tears mixing with rage.

Verity, cornered, hung her head. “I didn’t mean… I just wanted to prove I could do it.”

Cortex didn’t destroy her. Instead, he handed her over to the authorities, Freddie’s memory a silent witness to his restraint.

At Freddie’s funeral, Cortex stood alone. He laid a single model train on the grave and whispered, “Rest in peace, brother. I’ll do better. For you.”



# Story 3: Papu Papu Goes to Hawaii

**Location: Maui, Hawaii**

Papu Papu had never flown before. The big man squeezed himself into the tiny airplane seat, scowling at the snack tray that refused to stay up. But when the plane dipped below the clouds, showing the sparkling blue of Maui’s coastline, Papu’s scowl softened.

He was here to visit his brother, Kimo, who’d left the islands years ago and made it big as a hotel mogul. Papu, chief of the Wumpa Islands, had always considered himself content: simple food, simple living, respect from his tribe. But when Kimo sent the invitation first class, all expenses paid Papu’s curiosity (and, he admitted, pride) won out.

Kimo’s house was enormous, perched on a cliff above the sea. Papu arrived, sweating and travel-worn, to find Kimo waiting in linen clothes, sunglasses glinting.

“Brother!” Kimo boomed, hugging him. “You look… well. Still skipping leg day, I see?”

Papu grunted and hugged back, hard enough to make Kimo wince. “This place is fancy. You always wanted the big stuff, huh?”



Kimo laughed, but his eyes flicked away. “Come, let me show you around.”

The days passed in a blur of luxury lobster dinners, jet skis, private luaus. Papu felt out of place, his island tattoos and broad frame a stark contrast to Kimo’s polished world. Old wounds bubbled up.

One night, after too many Wumpa cocktails, Papu grumbled, “You always wanted more. Bigger house, more money. Left us behind.”

Kimo’s smile faded. “And you always wanted to stay the same. Never change, never leave the island. I had to make something of myself.”

“You think I’m nothing because I stayed?”



Kimo shook his head. “No, Papu. I envy you. I built all this, but I never felt at home. You have something I can’t buy.”

The brothers sat in silence, the waves crashing below. Finally, Kimo said softly, “Maybe I needed to prove something. Not to you, to myself.”

Papu put a hand on his brother’s shoulder. “We both did, I guess.”

The next day, Kimo took Papu to a hidden cove. No tourists, no hotels just sand and sea. They swam, laughed, and for a moment, they were kids again, racing the tide.

When Papu left Maui, he hugged Kimo at the airport. “Visit the islands. The tribe misses you.”



Kimo nodded, tears in his eyes. “I will, brother. I promise.”

As the plane lifted off, Papu looked down at Maui, feeling lighter. Family, he realized, wasn’t about where you lived, but who you carried with you.

For the longest time I assumed my bumps were an acne issue or demodex issue. I kept trying sulfur washes, antifungals, acne treatments (ivermectin), etc. and every time I did that, I made my skin worse.

From what I'm understanding now, my Type II rosacea flare isn't a demodex-driven situation - it's a sensitive neurovascular phenotype thing. Let me explain.

my nerves + blood vessels overreact.
So harsh products = my skin panics
Sugar =  flare
Coffee = flare
Stress = flare

And this made so much sense because I also have gastritis and can't tolerate coffee well... both are inflammatory neurovascular triggers, not ""bacteria"" problems.

So instead of nuking my skin with a bunch of crap I need to just chill TF out and use a gentle cleanser. It's slowly healing. ",13,1762306123.0,Rosacea,6,1.0,False

1oopnzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oopnzh/covenant/,Covenant,"I always hated funerals. That’s not saying much, everyone hates funerals. But for some reason, for me,  it never seemed to be that distant cousin you’ve only ever heard about or maybe that 62 year old Aunt that you see every other Thanksgiving that brings the potato salad and spends the afternoon chain smoking on the patio. It was always the close ones. My first was my sister when I was 9, then my parents when I was 18. Now, standing in well worn shoes and my best black sport coat under a crisp blue October sky, I get the call for yet another. 

	My grandfather , or “Pa” as I always called him, was on the other end of the line. His voice shook as he spoke. “She’s gone. The funeral is next Saturday.” He spoke abruptly and the line cut. I stared at the phone for a moment, dumbstruck as I looked at the date. Before I was conscious again, I had packed a bag, loaded my car, and was driving out of the city and on a 4 hour drive back home.

	The mountains were beautiful in the fall, though the brilliant yellows and oranges were lost on me as my truck rounded the curves and corners as I neared the hollow. I had been born and raised in the mountains, this hollow (we called it “the holler”) and knew every road like the back of my hand, though each turn that brought me back tied an extra knot into my stomach. I had moved out the day after my parents' funeral. There was nothing here for me and I knew it. I went to school, lost my accent, and got a job in a call center. All the while, I never forgot where I came from. I made my final turn off the bumpy dirt road I was on onto an even more ragged looking dirt road that led up to my Grandma’s house. I held back the urge to vomit as I pulled up and parked in the yard. So many memories flooded back: running and playing, climbing trees. I looked down to the creek that flowed below the house remembering the almost 18 summers of swimming and catching frogs. I cut the ignition and stepped out. 

I saw Pa’s silhouette on the front porch rocker as I approached.. The porchlight shone harshly behind him and cast a long shadow across the lawn that wet my shoes with dew as I stepped through it before reaching the porch. I leaned against the post for a moment as I had so many times before, so many years ago, and studied the man that had practically raised me. We spoke not a word as we allowed our grief to fill the void of our silence. He reached beside him and produced a bottle which he poured into the cup sitting on the arm of the rocker that I just noticed. He sloshed the liquid once before downing it quickly, begrudgingly. 

	I was too shocked to react. Pa was a teetotaler. Ever since I was a kid if an alcohol commercial even came on the TV he would scowl and turn the channel as he mumbled under his breath. It only got worse after my parents, so to see him like this was unbelievable. He looked up to me, expectantly.

	“I know what you’re thinkin’, but don’t. You have no idea.” he scoffed and shook his head.

	“I wasn’t,” I said almost apologetically. I pointed to the bottle. 

He laughed joylessly and wheezed. “Why not?” He handed me the bottle and I turned up the mystery liquid. Cheap Vodka. I winced as it hit the back of my throat and handed it back to him. 

My eyes had become adjusted to the dim light and I could now clearly see him. When I had left he was in his 60’s but still a large framed and well built man, well accustomed to cutting and splitting his own firewood as well as any other task that comes along with maintaining a small farm. Now, only nine years later, the man has shriveled to less than half his size. His gold rimmed glasses which he wore since as long as I can recall sat so out from his head that he looked almost alien, as if they were set on a halloween prop skull. His shirt and overalls hung so loosely on him that they seemed as if they would fall off onto the floor like a snake or insect molting its skin if he did not hold himself in just the right way. 

	“Pa?” I asked, my mouth agape as I stepped closer to him. My eyes filled with tears to see the man I loved as a father reduced to such a husk of himself. He waved me away but I could tell that it also ate at him.

	‘Don’t start that,” He said sternly. “Now, let’s get inside ‘fore these skeeters eat us up.”

I nodded and tried to help him stand but again he swatted me away as he moved sluggishly towards the door in the way stop motion does between takes. I held the door for him before retrieving my suitcase from the bed of the truck and joining him inside. I passed by the wall of framed ribbons and newspaper clippings that my grandmother displayed proudly of her baking accomplishments, as well as her magazine covers and other achievements. Pa was already sitting in his recliner once I made my way inside, and again the memories flooded back once I smelled the smoke of the wood stove. 

Grandma would wake up as early as 4 in the morning and start her chores of milking the goats and gathering the eggs from the hens and geese in order to begin baking as soon as the sun rose. She would be in the kitchen all day experimenting with different recipes, scribbling notes as she hummed to herself and whirred around the kitchen to an unseeable rhythm. She worked ceaselessly and began to be rewarded. At first just at church bake sales, then the county fair, and before long her recipes were being regularly featured in home and garden magazines across the country. All from this little house in the middle of nowhere, USA. It was part of my weekly routine to buy whatever issue she was being published in while I was in the checkout line getting groceries; my last connection to back home. Once or twice I had attempted to recreate one of her recipes but the old saying stays true; nobody makes it like Grandma.

I walked over to Pa in his recliner but he snored, passed out with the bottle by his side. I took the afghan from the sofa and draped it over his frail frame before shutting off the lights and locking the door. I began to walk towards the stairs, ready to go up to the guest room and go to bed and try to forget about what I had seen today. As I moved past the basement door I noticed it was ajar. I did a double take. 

The basement had always been off limits for us kids. On Sundays the adults would go down to the basement and lock the door from the inside while the kids played outside or watched cartoons. Besides Sundays I had seen Grandma go down there dozens of times when I had spent the night, mostly in the morning. I had tried to catch glimpses and had wondered about it for years, but we dare not speak of it, and after being away for so long, I had completely forgotten about it until it lay open before me now. No longer a child, I looked back towards the living room down the hall. His snores echoed through the house. I pushed the heavy door open and flipped my phone’s flashlight on until I found the light switch and descended the stairs as quietly as I could.

I was confused once I arrived at the bottom. My mind had ran wild with what could be down here; prison cells, giant pentagrams painted in blood, a cyclops that eats Baby Ruth bars, anything. It was just a boring basement filled with brikabrak. There were a few shelves with paint cans older than I am, some folding chairs I had seen at family reunions and some canned goods. The only notable thing in the room was that in the middle of the dirt floor was a small crooked stump that stood at about knee level and as wide as a large dinner plate. It must have been here before the house was built and they kept it for sentimental reasons. I looked around, dejected, and sat on the stump, absent-mindedly drumming on it as I studied the block walls for signs of a hidden passage or for since-gone shackles. As my knuckles wrapped against the wood, I noticed that it was hollow, and as I looked between my legs down at the side of the stump, I noticed a small hole a little bigger than a fist. Curious, I stooped next to the hole and peered in. It was dark so I brought my flashlight up to the hole and could see objects of all nature inside; clumps of hair, pieces of jewelry, children's toys. Some looked more recent but others looked like antiques. A noise from the top of the stairs made me drop my phone, sending it into the dark pit as well. Pa stood at the top of the stairs, staring down at me. I fell backward onto the dirt, feeling like a kid again caught doing something they weren’t supposed to. Nine years ago he would have kicked my ass for coming down here, but it didn’t come. Instead he sighed and shuffled his way down onto the top step until he was sitting.

“Figured you’d find out eventually,” he said slowly.

“We called ‘em offerin’ holes. Some folks called ‘em Covenant boxes, if you were fancy and had a box, but we settled on offerin’ holes. If you ask the older people round here they heard of ‘em, but to see ‘em? Rare thing. To have one,” he whistled as he shook his head, clearly proud. “This land has been in our family a long time. My grandaddy, that’s your greatgrandaddy, traded for it- well you heard this story a hunrid times. Point is, he scouted it out because he heard it had an offering hole,” he pointed towards the stump, “And built this house on top of it so noone else could get to it. He was smart. But because so few people knew ‘bout the offerin’ holes they didn’t know that they come with conditions.”

I was still sitting on the dirt in the same position as the dust settled in the cold, musty room. “Pa, what are you talking about?”

“The hole. You put somethin’ in, you get somethin’ out.” He raised his eyebrows. “But people got greedy. They started asking for more and more, and it got hungry. The offerin’s weren’t enough.” He began to shake his head over and over, as if by compulsion. I pushed myself from the dirt and up the stairs. I picked up the old man and lay him on the sofa before calling 911 from the landline. The ambulance arrived 45 minutes later and I followed them to the hospital where I slept beside his bed on the cold tile floor, my dreams alive with thoughts of the treestump and visions of my grandmother and my childhood.

My sleep was broken throughout the night by nurses coming to check on the various beeping machines, and by 6 am I made my way to the lounge for a cup of drip coffee to start my day with the shift change. I sat by his bed as his eyelids fluttered and I looked pitifully on his emaciated body that almost shone lily white from under his gown. A rapid knock was followed by the light squeaking of hinges, and I was met with another new face above navy scrubs. 

“I’m Dr. Bauss, just checking in this morning,” he said with what passed for a smile before flipping a page in his clipboard. “How long have you been aware of your grandfather’s condition?”

I looked at him strangely. “I just arrived last night, I wasn’t aware of how bad he had gotten. We haven’t spoken in years.”

He clicked his pen harshly before jotting some notes and turning to Pa. He removed a penlight from his pocket and shone it into each of his eyes as he held his lids back before writing more notes. “A nurse should be here every hour, if you need anything just hit the call button,” he said with that weak smile again as he turned to leave.

“Excuse me,” I spoke up. He turned again, eyebrows raised in minor annoyance. “Sorry, it’s just we’ve been in all night and I’m not sure what’s going on besides,” I motioned to Pa’s gaunt body, “the obvious. What’s wrong with him?”

“A brain tumor.” The words shot from his lips like daggers. “Frankly I am surprised he has made it this long after seeing the scans. It is,” he realized his tone and adjusted. “Quite advanced. I’m very sorry.” He frowned apologetically as he crossed his hands in front of him, holding the clipboard. “Please, hit the call button if you need anything. He will likely be unresponsive for a while. We have counselors and a chapel downstairs if you need to take a walk.” He nodded and left the room, which was all the same. I sat with my head in my hands, considering my next move. It didn’t take long. It was around 2pm when it started. The screaming. 

He looked as peaceful as a sleeping infant one moment, and I was just drifting off into an uncomfortable nap in the chair next to his bed when suddenly he sat straight up and began screaming as he clawed at the sheets. His face contorted into something from a nightmare, stretching to the limits of muscle and ligaments, which were already visible due to his extreme emaciation, now seemed to pop and dislocate more as he screamed in agony at something I could not see. His eyes finally fixed on me as I fell back uselessly in the chair as nurses piled into the room. His cries of agony began to form syllables and then words. I made out:

“It’s real! It’s so hot!” and “God forgive me!” dozens and dozens of times he pleaded with heaven as the nurses tried to manage the gangly old man and one finally managed to sedate him as his eyes rolled back in his head, at the same time the heart monitor flatlined. They tried to resuscitate him but it was no use. He was gone. I walked out of the room and vomited in the nearest wastebasket as the world around me continued to spin. I hate funerals.



Saturday I was standing in the cemetery behind the First Baptist Church that Pa had been a Deacon of for over 50 years as we lowered two more caskets into the cold earth. There weren’t many of us left to mourn; a few scattered cousins I hadn’t seen since before my sister’s accident and an Aunt I couldn't believe was still alive. Then there was Uncle Dan. Dan was one of the few that would come over on Sundays. He was dressed sharp and his face was sunken with sadness. He sobbed uncontrollably once the caskets were out of sight and again once the service began to the point he had to excuse himself. I caught up with him as he leaned against his truck, blowing his nose into a silk handkerchief. He noticed me coming and he brightened, if only slightly.

“Heard you were back. They said you was with ‘em when he passed… is that right?” he looked up at me under the brim of his black Stetson like a child. He seemed frightened of the answer.

“Yeah, I almost wish I wasn’t.”

“He screamed?” he asked quickly, directly. I nodded. I could tell the answer upset him, though I’m not sure which part.

“It was pretty scary,” I started but he held a hand up. 

“They always scream,” he spat black tobacco juice onto the asphalt.

“What do you mean?” I asked, dumbly.

He looked at me blankly. “You’re old enough, ain’t ya? You know about the offerin’ hole? Them’s that used it go in bad ways. They always go out screamin’.” He said it so matter of fact that I was in shock. I was expecting to build up to asking about it, not to have him come out and tell me about it. 

“But what is it? Pa told me a little the night before-” I trailed off.

Dan shook his head. “Aint much to tell. There’s strangeness all ‘round these parts, always has been. Injuns knew it ‘fore white man ever stepped foot here.” He spit again. “ How I heard it, was that long ago if they were a travellin’ on a long journey and ran outta food, the Cherokee would have their Chief talk to Unetlanvhi-that’s God to you and me- and he would make a hole appear in a tree or the face of a rock. Now in return for an arrowhead or a deer antler or whatever offering you gave up, he would reward you for what you needed on your journey. Now come along the Pilgrims and the settlers and so on and so forth and before long everyone wants to get in on these magic holes in the ground, but the Cherokee don’t want no part in it since it’s sacred ground. So what do we do? We pack ‘em up and ship ‘em out west. Eventually we lose track of which hole is an offerin’ hole and which one isn’t, but your great grandaddy found that one there in the basement and built his house on it to pass down generation to generation as his own personal wishing well. And they’re payin’ the price,” he shook his head. “I bet it’s plum full, ain't it? Three generations of odds and ends trading. For what? Your Grandma would go down there all hours and ring the sweat from her hands as she was bakin’ in that kitchen. Thinkin’ that-” he stopped himself.

“Dan,” I shook my head. “Every Sunday when I was little you, Pa, Grandma and my parents would go down there for hours. If that’s true, what were you really doing?”

He cocked his head at me, “You ain't used it, have you?” His question seemed less accusatory than concerned. I shook my head.

He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled grimly. “You were always the smart one. It’s best to just head back after this. Let that house rot or better yet; burn it down and collect the insurance check. That would be the best outcome for all of us,” he chuckled then gripped me tightly. “But don’t you go foolin’ with that. It’s not a game and it only ends one way,” he jerked his thumb back toward the funeral. I pulled out of his grasp and walked to my own truck, trying to process the torrent of information I had just been bombarded with.

I drove back through town, past the fading small business signs and shuttered storefronts as I made my way back to the only place I knew. I pulled into the driveway and parked, looking up to the row of rockers on the front porch, all empty. In days past this house would be full to bursting on birthdays and holidays, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas, and each rocker would be filled by a different relative chatting about the past while the kids dashed between them playing their games. Now the late fall wind blew them ominously, and all the cheer and warmth was gone. I shuffled through the house like a ghost, restless as I moved room to room. Death had dealt a final blow and I wasn’t sure how to go on or what to do. I spent some time tidying the kitchen, building a fire in the woodstove to push back against the looming cold and gloom from outside, and flipped through old photo albums. 

I flipped to the most recent ones of Grandma and Pa around the house just going about their routines; Grandma baking or Pa fishing down by the creek. He looked healthy, happy. No idea of the ticking time bomb inside his own body. I carefully slid the photo out and turned it over out of curiosity. The date on the back was just in August. I couldn’t believe it. I turned past the ones of my parents and sister. It was just too painful to look at them. I kept going until I reached the beginning. There were some very old tin type photos encased that I dare not touch, a few stern portraits of who I recognized to be my great grandparents. There were a few birth certificates and documents showing their journey from Ellis Island through boat and train tickets and finally on the next page was a singular photo. It was my great grandfather again, but this time he stood next to a tall oak that extended beyond the borders of the photo. His eyes bore into mine through the photo and at the base of the trunk I could make out a hole. About the size of a fist. I closed the album and tossed it onto the coffee table before sitting back into the mustard colored sofa. 

I tilted my head back and closed my eyes. I still refused to believe it all. My family was strange and the mountains have a lot of superstitions but this? I patted my pockets for my phone when the realization hit me. It had fallen into the hole. I had forgotten about it with all that had happened in the previous days. I’m sure I had some missed calls from work. I moved down the hall to the basement door. I paused as I reached for the door knob when the thought occurred to me: was my phone an offering? It troubled me. Still, no coward, I pushed the door open and descended the stairs to the basement.

The stump sat innocently enough in the middle, just where I left it. Still, I approached it cautiously. I’m not sure what I expected, some ghastly hand from beyond to pull me to the depths, never to be seen again or the spirit of a native american to throw a tomahawk ala *The Patriot* and hit me right between the eyes. Either way, what I was not expecting was for my phone to be lying neatly on top of the stump and undamaged, no less. I picked it up and examined it. It was dead from multiple days away but it seemed fine. I scratched my chin as I paced the dirt floor. Had one of the paramedics somehow fished it out when I wasn’t looking? That can’t be right, we were already upstairs when they arrived and I had already forgotten about it by then. I stared into the hole. Had it rejected the offering? This thought put a knot in my stomach. I had to test it. 

I patted myself, searching for something I wouldn’t mind losing. I looked down at my ragged shoes. I could use some new ones anyway. I kicked one off, steadying myself on the stump before shoving it into the hole.

“Alright,” I said to the air as I rubbed my hands together. “I’m offering this shoe in exchange for-” I paused. I hadn’t thought this through. What did I want? Pa had said that this thing-whatever it was, was hungry from people making unfair trades. I decided to start small. 

“-In exchange for another shoe. Same type, just new.”

I held my breath as the dust settled in the musty basement. I strained my ears for any hint of sound, but could hear nothing but the beating of my own heart and the creaking of the old house as it settled. Even the dust particles that floated under the bare hanging incandescent bulbs seemed to suspend their movement as I waited for something to happen. But nothing did. Frustrated and only wearing one shoe, I gave up and went back upstairs to the roaring fire and away from the dark and dankness of the basement. 

Once I had warmed up I dug through the standing freezer in the kitchen which was packed to the brim with dishes Grandma had cooked and saved. There were countless souflees, soups, pasta dishes, and even several well decorated cakes I recognized from a magazine article last month. I threw one of the entrees in the oven and as I waited on the timer, I could swear I heard a light rustling sound in the basement. I took off my other shoe and silently snuck over to the fireplace where I retrieved the iron poker and then slowly approached the basement door.

I listened closely at the door but heard nothing as I gripped the handle. I turned it slowly and pushed open the door, flipping on the lights. I slowly creeped down each step, expecting an ambush at any minute when suddenly the \**BEEP BEEP BEEP\** from the oven timer went off causing me to lose my balance and fall down the last four stairs, landing on the dirt floor. I got to my feet as quickly as I could, cursing my stupidity, but as soon as I had my wits about me again I was stunned. There, sitting on top of the stump was a single black shoe, shined to perfection. I fell towards, crawling on my knees in the dirt until I reached its shining black magnificence. I immediately began to pull my second shoe off and shoved it forcefully down the hole. 

“I offer this in exchange for another shoe, brand new and shiny!” I shouted, saliva spewing from my mouth as I wasted no time turning to run back up the stairs. I slammed the door behind me and slumped against it on the floor as I listened and waited. This time it seemed a shorter wait as soon I heard the strange shuffling again, and without hesitation I flung myself back to my feet and back down the stairs. Again, there next to the first shoe was a second one, as shiny and black as the first. I laughed hysterically and jumped across the floor like Angus Young across the stage. I sat down and tried the shoes on. A perfect fit. I took a few tentative steps and they needed no breaking in. I laughed at myself getting excited about a new pair of shoes as my mind raced at the possibilities. Work could call all day, I could print money, plane tickets, Gold bars, whatever I could imagine. Then Dan’s words came back to me: ‘It’s not a game and it only ends one way.’

I walked back upstairs as the smoke alarm beeped and pulled the charred casserole out of the oven and on to the large oak table. I cracked the kitchen window, wafting the smoke out as I waited for the dish to cool and as I did I could swear I spotted movement beyond the trees. It was so sudden I could not tell large nor small, feather nor fur, man nor beast, vapor nor corporeal, so I dismissed it and returned to the task at hand. Once the food could cool enough to only scald my mouth just below the point of a hospital visit I scarfed it down with mouthfuls of cold well water as my mind whirred. My eyes darted the room for possible offerings. Pa had said that it was hungry. I looked around. ‘*People got greedy*.’  I can’t get greedy. I pushed from the table and pulled the refrigerator open. I pulled out one of the cakes Grandma had made and that had featured in the October issue of *Southern Living.* I smiled sadly at it, then carried it down to the basement. I had to now. I ripped it out of its cellophane encasement and shoved it, crumbling bit by bit into the hole. Tears rolled down my faces as I flung the last of the frosting from my fingers into the pit.

 “I offer this in exchange for another cake. Just like Grandma used to make.” I wiped away my tears and retreated up the stairs, closing the door behind me. I washed the frosting from my hands at the sink and returned to the basement door. I waited. The shadows outside grew longer as the minutes ticked by in the old clock that hung above the fireplace. The minutes dragged to hours as I waited, patiently. As patient as I was, the sleepless days eventually caught up to me and before I knew it I was waking up the next morning in a pool of my own saliva. 

I pushed myself up from the floorboards as amber rays of sun peeked in between the burgundy curtains in the living room above the sofa. I wiped my face, attempting to separate dream from reality when I remembered the basement. I ventured down once again. I held my breath as my head passed the threshold of the first floor, as if I were retreating into the depths of an unseen watery abyss and kept it in until I arrived at the bottom of the steps. There was nothing on the stump. I panicked as I searched the room, then as if a lightbulb went off, I ran back upstairs and checked the fridge and then the stove. There was nothing. It had not accepted the offering.

 I spent the rest of the day experimenting. I would drop various objects from around the house down the hole and ask only small things in return. There was only one constant: It only accepted the offerings that belonged to me. Buttons off my shirt, a clump of hair, my toothbrush, all accepted and in a swift manner. Everything else was ignored. I sat on the floor in the living room in front of my open suitcase. It had been hastily packed and carried nothing of value. A few shirts, change of pants and underwear. Not even a second pair of socks. I cursed as I kicked it across the floor, knocking into the coffee table and as it did, the scrapbook clattered to the floor. I crawled over to it to put it back in it’s place but paused. It had opened to the photo of my sister. My hand hovered over the photo before sliding it out and sliding my thumb over the glossy cellulose, lovingly. I thought back of my life before I had come back. Late hours in the office. Drinking alone. Friends all moved away. No more. I kissed the photo and stood back up as I moved back to the kitchen and threw open the junk drawer. I retrieved Grandma’s hand-held pruning shears she kept for her rose bushes and returned to my sanctuary downstairs and my altar at the stump. Without a final glance I pulled the pruning shears from my pocket and crunched through my pinkie. It took a few tries to free it of the ligament and dangling skin but once I had, I tossed it in the hole and wrapped the wound with my shirt as I whispered my desire. This time when I left the room I went straight out the door and drove to the gas station. I parked and bought a single Powerball ticket from the wide eyed attendant. The rest of the day was agony as I waited for the hours to pass until the draw. When it finally did happen and I watched in front of the giant, ancient CRT in the living room as they called out each of my numbers, I did not feel shocked. The next day when I walked into the Lottery office and wired the funds into my account I did not feel happy. 

It’s been nine years since then and no matter where I go in the world, I know it will follow me. That’s why I returned home again. The house is untouched. The power has been off and black flies cover the inside, trying to get to the food that has been in the refrigerator and freezer. I have one last offering, one last trade to make. I’ve made several in the years since then. My left arm up to my elbow is now gone. My money is spent and I have nowhere else to go. I look at the photo of my sister once more before I head down the stairs lit only by memory.  I look into the hole. It seems bigger than since I was last here. “I trade one life for another. That is my offering.” I hold up the photo in the dark, then set it on top of the stump, feeling my way. I crawl into the hole on my hands and knees, and scream all the way down.

1oopnzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Createhorrorwithme/comments/1oopnzb/the_bellmare_hotel/,The Bellmare Hotel,"They called it the Bellmare Hotel, but in the backwoods outside New Orleans people whispered another name for it — the Place That Breathes at Night.

I first heard about it while I was sitting at my kitchen table, editing another ghostless investigation. The footage was just creaking pipes and dust motes; the usual. My coffee had gone cold hours ago, and Donny — my assistant and self-proclaimed “tech support for the damned” — was asleep in the van, half a beignet stuck to his cheek.

That’s when the email came.

Subject: “The Bellmare Needs You.”

The message was short:

> Strange events. Guests leaving terrified. Lights flicker, voices in the walls, woman in a burned dress. Please come. We’ll pay double your rate.



Signed, Carl Renier, Co-owner, Bellmare Hotel.

Double. That got my attention.

When I showed Donny, he grinned, powdered sugar puffing into the air.
“Double pay to not find ghosts? Hell yeah, let’s go make rent and a documentary.”

I didn’t believe in hauntings. I never have. I’m Sami Arquette, thirty-seven, full-time paranormal investigator, part-time skeptic. Donny believes in everything; I believe in physics, bad plumbing, and how far a desperate business will go for clicks.

Three nights later, we rolled up a dirt road lined with moss-draped trees, the swamp pressing in from both sides. Fog curled around the headlights, thick as milk.

Then the Bellmare appeared through the mist — a three-story corpse of a building, its white paint peeled gray, balconies warped and drooping. The sign out front swayed on one rusted chain:
BELLMARE HOTEL — WHERE HISTORY NEVER CHECKS OUT.

“Cheery,” Donny said. “Let’s hope they got Wi-Fi for when the demons start their OnlyFans.”

Inside, the lobby was spotless but wrong — overbright, lemon cleaner fighting the damp smell of old wood. A chandelier buzzed faintly overhead.

Carl Renier waited behind the counter, tall, thinning hair, sweat on his collar. His wife, Grace, stood beside him twisting a rosary between pale fingers.

“Mr. Arquette,” Carl said, gripping my hand too tightly. “We’re honored you came.”

I smiled for the camera. “We’re here to help.”

He hesitated. “Guests… they’ve been leaving mid-stay. They say they hear crying, or see someone standing in the halls. One woman said she woke to a figure sitting at the end of her bed.”

Donny whistled. “Classic haunting starter pack. So — tragic maid, vengeful mistress, or Civil War soldier?”

Grace’s eyes darted toward the east hallway. “There was a fire. 1987. A maid didn’t make it out.”

The chandelier hummed louder. Carl cleared his throat and offered us keys.


---

We started setup before midnight: static cameras in the hallways, an EVP recorder in the ballroom, infrared in the basement. Donny handled the gear, muttering about “ghosts that need better lighting.”

I filmed the intro. “The Bellmare Hotel,” I said into the lens, “home to tragedy, rumors, and—if we’re lucky—bad acting. Tonight, Bayou Paranormal finds out what really haunts these halls.”

By two a.m., nothing. Donny had dozed off on the couch, snoring softly. I watched the monitors, half-listening to the rain against the windows.

Then camera four flickered.

A figure stepped into frame. Long hair. Torn dress. Bare feet.

She turned toward the camera and smiled before walking straight through the east hallway door.

I froze. Then bolted upstairs.

The hall was empty. The smell of lemon cleaner hung heavy. I replayed the clip — but now the footage was gone, replaced by static.

I didn’t sleep that night.


---

Morning came gray and sticky. One camera had been nudged. An audio recorder was unplugged. When I asked Carl, he looked like I’d slapped him. “We don’t touch your things,” he said. Grace avoided my eyes.

That night, I hid a motion cam in the east hallway.

At 1:34 a.m., it caught a staff member creeping along with a white sheet in his hands.

Donny and I confronted him in the laundry room. He went white as chalk.

“Please don’t fire me,” he stammered. “Carl said it’s just to scare guests! For publicity!”

Grace showed up crying. “It was Carl’s idea,” she said. “He said no one books boring hotels.”

I felt fury rising. “You faked all of it?”

Carl arrived mid-argument, pale and sweating. “It was harmless,” he said. “Just marketing. You of all people should understand—people pay to be afraid.”

I wanted to punch him.

Donny muttered, “Well, congrats, boss. We just debunked a business plan.”

We agreed to leave at dawn.


---

We packed in silence. Donny tried to joke, but it died halfway out of his mouth. The air in the Bellmare felt heavier now, like the walls were holding their breath.

“Let’s just grab a few hours of sleep,” I said, throwing cables into the case. “We’ll shoot a wrap-up in the morning, expose the scam, and get out.”

He nodded. “Fine by me. This place gives me hives anyway.”

Upstairs, the halls were too quiet. No humming from the chandelier, no creak from the stairs. Just that sterile lemon-cleaner smell that somehow made the air colder. We passed the east hallway, and every bulb flickered in a slow ripple as we went by, one after another, like something was following us just out of sight.

In the room, Donny sprawled on the couch with his headphones in. I sat at the desk, typing notes for the video: Fake haunting—owners using staff to boost bookings. I should’ve felt vindicated. Instead, I kept glancing at the mirror opposite the bed. Sometimes it looked like there was a smudge near the corner; sometimes it looked like the smudge moved.

Down the hall, a door shut softly. I froze.

“Did you hear that?”

Donny pulled out one earbud. “Wind.”

“There’s no wind in here.”

He sighed. “Man, you’re the skeptic. Don’t start believing now.”

He went back to his music. I sat there listening. For a few minutes everything stayed still, then faint footsteps crossed the floor above us. Too slow for plumbing, too deliberate to be rats.

I opened the window for air. The swamp outside glowed silver under the moon, mist curling between the trees. From somewhere near the old east wing came a single, sharp sound—like metal dragging over stone.

“Maintenance,” I muttered, even though I knew the staff had gone home hours ago.

When I turned back, Donny was sitting up, staring at the door. “Someone just walked by,” he whispered.

I opened it; the hall was empty. But the carpet was still moving, just slightly, as if it had been brushed by something passing.

We left the lights on after that.

Around two, Grace came down the hallway carrying a tray of tea. She smiled like she hadn’t been caught running a fake haunting twelve hours earlier.

“Couldn’t sleep,” she said softly. “Thought you might want something warm.”

Her hands were shaking so badly the cups rattled.

“You alright?” I asked.

She hesitated. “Carl’s been… unsettled. Keeps hearing things in the walls. Keeps saying it’s her.”

“Your actress?” Donny asked.

Her eyes lifted slowly to his. “We only had one actor, Mr. Donny. And he went home before dark.”

The tray tilted; hot tea splashed her wrist. She didn’t even flinch.

She set the tray down and left without another word.

Donny exhaled. “Well that was cheerful.”

I tried to laugh. It came out hollow.

We both lay awake after that, the ticking of the old wall clock dragging minutes like hours. Somewhere far off, a door slammed hard enough to rattle the glass.

“Raccoons,” I said automatically.

“Big ones,” Donny muttered.

Neither of us slept.

Just before three, the chandelier’s hum started again—low, electrical, almost like a breath. The lights dimmed, brightened, dimmed again. Then silence.

I glanced at Donny. “Pack the rest of the stuff. We’re gone first light.”

He nodded, already rolling up cables.

That’s when we heard it: one deep, dragging thud from below. Then another.

The floor shivered under us, like someone was moving heavy furniture in the basement.

Donny froze. “They don’t have guests down there, right?”

“No,” I said. “Basement’s just storage.”

The third thud came with a sound like a sigh rising through the vents—wet, uneven, too close.

And then we heard footsteps in the hall.

Slow. Bare.

They stopped outside our door.

Neither of us breathed.

Then a knock—three gentle taps, like knuckles on wood.

Donny whispered, “If that’s Grace again, I’m quitting.”

But the voice that came through the door wasn’t hers. It was a man’s, low and hoarse.

“Please… help me.”

We looked at each other.

The knock came again, louder this time.

Then Grace’s voice, far down the hall, screaming: “It’s Carl! He’s in the basement!”

And the voice outside our door stopped.


---

The air in the basement was colder, wet enough to sting. The lights flickered, then went dark completely.

We followed Grace’s sobs down the stairs. Carl was on the floor, twitching, eyes rolled back. His shirt was burned, like something had seared him from the inside out.

The smell hit me—metallic, sweet, electric.

Symbols were carved into the beams above him, blackened, still smoking.

Donny whispered, “They’re not yours, are they?”

Grace just stared. “It’s her,” she said. “The firemaid. She’s angry.”

Carl’s eyes snapped open. His voice came out in two tones at once—one human, one like an echo.

“You wanted ghosts.”

Every bulb in the ceiling burst at once, glass raining down.

We ran.

Up the stairs, through the lobby. The chandelier swayed above us like something had brushed it. The front doors slammed shut on their own.

From somewhere upstairs came laughter. A woman’s, high and warped, echoing through the vents.

Donny shouted, “It’s a hoax, right? It’s gotta be—”

Then a mirror shattered beside us.

In the shards on the floor, her reflection stared up—black eyes, burned skin, smiling.

When I turned around, she was standing behind Grace.

The lights went out.


---

We woke outside at dawn. The doors hung open, smoke curling from the basement windows. The hotel burned until only the frame remained.

No trace of Carl. No trace of Grace.

When I got home and checked the footage, the final clip froze my blood.

It wasn’t her.

It was Donny.

Standing behind me, eyes black, smiling too wide for his face.

He hasn’t answered a call since.

And last night, my phone lit up with a message from an unknown number.

It said:
You wanted ghosts.

Here's the unfiltered story of how it went.,"When I was 17, all my friends were getting part-time jobs at coffee shops or bagging groceries. I tried that, but my brain just wasn't wired for it. I was restless. So, I did what any nerdy, ambitious teenager with too much time on their hands would do: I started a web hosting company. I literally had no idea what I was doing. My 'office' was my bedroom, still decorated with video game posters, and my first server was an old desktop computer humming so loudly in the corner I could barely sleep.

The first year was a brutal mix of excitement and sheer panic. I was finishing high school homework during the day and then staying up until 3 AM answering support tickets from my first few clients. I remember the absolute thrill of seeing that first $10 payment notification pop up on my phone. It felt like I'd won the lottery. But I also remember the stomach-sinking dread when a server crashed and I had to frantically Google solutions while a client was rightfully freaking out in my inbox. I was in way over my head, just paddling furiously to stay afloat.

By the time I hit 20, things had changed. That one humming desktop had turned into a rack of actual servers in a data center. I wasn't just a kid messing around anymore; I had real responsibilities, actual revenue, and a couple of friends I'd roped in to help me. The journey from 17 to 20 wasn't some flashy success story you see on Instagram. It was a slow, painful, and incredibly rewarding grind. It was about learning things the hard way, like how to talk to angry customers, how to manage money when you've never had any, and how to deal with the insane loneliness of working for yourself.

Looking back, the biggest lesson wasn't about servers or marketing—it was about resilience. It taught me that it's okay to not know everything. You just have to be willing to learn faster than you're failing. It was the best and hardest education I could have ever asked for.

Took a hiatus from dating for a bit and now dipping my toes in again, it being cuffing season and all. 

About me:  Creative, affectionate, slightly grimy femme with a tendency to always say too much. I am a non profit director, social justice advocate, bleeding heart, (vintage) clothes horse, and a decent Scrabble player. 44 and growing, but not grown. Always listening to music, I WILL share songs with you, regularly.  

Physically (people have types), I'm tallish, slim build, leggy, blonde. Great tits. Not *high* femme, in that I don't do manicures or waxing or things that require a lot of maintenance. I'm vain, sure,  but more lip stain than lipstick, I guess? 

My hobbies include antiquing and curb scavenging, starting projects (proudly maintaining about a 40% completion rate), cobbling things together, annoying my dog, and lovin' on my community. A night in with someone I adore is never disappointing, but I also like an excuse to dress extra nice and go out on the town to show off/be shown off from time to time. I am outdoorsy in that I love to be outside (when it's above 60), but I'm not a high intensity outdoor adventurer - casual camping and leisurely exploration of forest trails are more my speed. 

I am most attracted to those who are masc of center (butches to the front!), socially conscious, empathetic, and unpretentious. Humor is important - the ability to crack jokes about the human condition is a turn on. I like bodies of all kinds - it's *style* that gets my motor running, far more than physique. 

I'm looking for someone who enjoys  massive amounts of physical affection, and who doesn't mind getting a little dirty (literally, but also...you know). Sharing space at mine means sharing space with a cat and a dog, so it's important that you're not allergic, or averse to animals on furniture. Oh, and bonus points if you enjoy cooking.

My ultimate objective is to find my person for the long haul, but I'm not in a screaming hurry and so I'm for sure open to casual dating and friend making along the way. 

Real forward of me, but it's gotta be said if you're looking for a more than friends thing: I am a subby, enthusiastic service bottom with a high libido and require a dominant partner. 

Message me if you're local-ish and down to keep in-app or online small talk to a reasonable minimum before we get to the part where meet up to suss each other out over  a drink/coffee, and/or maybe go for a walk in the city. 

If you're *not"" local, but still might want to get to know each other and/or need someone to practice your sexting skills with, shoot your shot! If your energy matches mine, I'm likely game for that too. 

I've opened my dorky comment history as evidence that I'm a whole real person, and I will ofc share pics as appropriate.

I had plans for a large area rug, an accent chair or two, round coffee table, and lots of shelving and storage. For shelving, I am looking at the IKEA BOAXEL shelving or the like (I've looked at Vitsoe shelving as an expensive alternative), with BESTA shelves below sitting on the floor as a long console. I am having a hard time deciding which wall to put shelving on. Originally, I was looking at the wall with the small window in the middle (boaxel style shelving on either side and above), but now I'm thinking it should go on the main naked wall opposite the main entry wall. I need help putting together a plan for this small-ish formal living room (no TV in here) that won't interrupt the flow of traffic, general feng shui, etc. The style I'm going for is modern but somewhat eccentric. I love big art pieces, photos and color. I'm open to all creative ideas! Thanks in advance.

For the purpose of this story, I’ll call him Bryan.

Bryan is a skinny guy, nice hair, good pictures which looked like he put in an effort unlike most other guys. His profile gave off less “macho” and felt like a breath of fresh air. Great start.

We got to talking and started calling. I liked him even more because he seemed more emotionally mature and softer toward me. 

On our first call, I noticed that Bryan sounded more feminine too, like, he spoke like a cliché tv gay man would speak. I apologize deeply if this is offensive in anyway. It was not intended.

I tried flirting with him on several occasions but he seemed to either go quiet, change the topic, or just wouldn’t flirt back.

I initially thought he was probably wanting to connect more without flirting or start out as friends so I stopped. The conversations started to feel like a drag or just talking to someone who wasn’t completely interested but was sweet to me. I noticed I had to be more “girl” “omg” to match his energy.

I showed my straight male friend at the time the picture of the nice guy I was talking to and he said he thought I was speaking with a gay man and “wasting my time”. I just chucked his opinion up to him not being cool enough to understand feminine straight men.


One thing lead to another while on the phone one night and I asked if he was gay. I don’t know why I did it, it probably was rude but I needed to know, because I was kinda second guessing our connection if you would call it that. I figured why not, and plus, if he was bi, that would’ve been fine too!

He said something along the lines of he wasn’t gay because he had either given a man head, or gotten head, or kissed a guy and he didn’t like it so he was sure he wasn’t gay. I can’t remember exactly which it was but I clearly remember him saying “oh honey, and if I was gay, I wouldn’t be a bottom”.

So I believed him. And told my straight male friend that he was wrong and my new found guy was straight.

Eventually, the conversation sizzled out because he was only giving one-syllabic answers and not speaking with me as much anymore.

I proceeded to stalk his social media a little to stare at his pictures and got over him overtime. We never met in person.


Fast forward to about 3 months ago. He messages me and says he misses me, and explained that he was building up his career that’s why he went MIA. We started talking but I wasn’t too interested anymore. Happy to connect with him though.


We started talking again, and I noticed he seemed more interested and more intense than before. He would occasionally throw in “wanting to find his person” and marriage and stuff like that very subtly. Hmm.

We were also trying to set up meet ups where I go see him. For context , he lives in a small town in the Midwest and I live in a city. I didn’t want to go to his side of the country without knowing him fully so I decided it would be better if I took a train there and passed by on my way to somewhere else when the train had a stopover. 

It never happened. He then said he had an old friend he was coming to visit in my city and I told him great! We could meet up for coffee. He said he didn’t think so, because he wanted to meet me at a better time when he was only coming for me. He spent about 3 days in an area 15-20 minutes from where I lived. 

No problem. We arranged maybe November. At this point I’m thinking we could at least meet up and be better friends and I’d explain we should stay the same way.

Mind you, flirting isn’t still working out this time too.

Then, I saw his posts on his social media and he took pictures with his friends who were all girls in a photo booth, in a bar, and the one that caught my attention, in bed with all three of his girlfriends for a sleepover.

I finally decided to tell my other friends who are gay and ask them for their opinion on this guy I was talking to. Without adding any specifics on my suspicions on him being gay.

I forwarded a voice message he sent me and some pictures of him.

My Male GBF and his boyfriend texted me instantly to ask why I was trying to get with a gay man. I told them he said he wasn’t and GBF said to block him immediately.

Female GBF said she thought he was in denial and felt bad for him. Asked me to block him too.

I just don’t understand though. He seems so nice and wanted to genuinely help me with getting a better job when I was struggling but he said I’d have to move to his town and live close to him and maybe we could get married.

That scares and confuses me at the same time. What are you guys’ thoughts and advice on this?

I didn’t tell my friends all the details about the moving and marriage thing, which I WOULD NOT dream to do but, I don’t understand this guy.

I haven’t blocked him yet and don’t know what to tell him he did to me to want to cut off from him.

He has texted me asking why I haven’t responded to him and asking what he did. I don’t understand.

1oopgyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1oopgyl/new_to_a_now_poly_relationship/,New to a now poly relationship,"Hello to the redditors here. I'm not really sure that posting here will be helpful but I don't really have much in person community to to discuss this with.

Recently, my partner and I have seemingly stumbled into a poly situation - I'd consider poly being evolved with others emotionally,  romantically, and sexually - not just sexually open.

Background: we have been together for a little over five years, and have lived together almost four years.

When we started seeing each other seriously and discussed what a relationship looks like for each of us, we decided that we would be monogamous to start, but down the road be open sexually. Several months into dating each other seriously we played with a friend together, and then eventually, after we began living together, we felt like there was good trust and communication and we discussed the relationship again about opening up and playing with others individually. 

We discussed what that looked like, what kind of communication we each needed and wanted, and how much contact with others we'd have etc. We decided definitively at that point that we were not going to be poly, and that we would limit the open nature to sex. 

Fast forward a couple years. People change and grow, and my partner discovered for themselves that they don't much enjoy random sex and would much prefer some connection a FWB or two. So we discussed the openness again what we each needed from each other and what we were each comfortable with. 

On to recent days: things started to shift with one of my partners few FWB. Seeing each other up to two or three times a week, sometimes late into the night on weeknights, sometimes the entirety of a day on the weekend - only coming home to go to bed.

This set me off after about a month or so of this pattern. It was clear to be that something more is happening.
I was definitely feeling jealousy, left out, not communicated with about things. The entirety of a weekend day thing combined with the frequency is what really got me. 

I asked to talk to my partner about it. And shared that I felt left out, did feel some jealousy, asked if there was something going on with them. My partner said no, but that they do enjoy the time they spend with that person. I expressed my discomfort with the frequency of the very extended time they were spending together, especially given that the last time we had spoken about what the openess of our relationship looked like we had defined that this type of activity was not something that we would do. I acknowledged that I'm going through other outside stress with work and family right now and that had worn down my emotional resilience but that I had sat with this for a couple weeks before deciding to bring it up and that I still felt uncomfortable about it. I also communicated that I DO want my partner to have authentic and valuable connections with people, and that I'm not comfortable with placing demands or ultimatums on them as well, that we should be having open and mutual discussion and framing our expectations from a shared understanding.

My partner did acknowledged my feelings and thanked me for sharing and reassured me of their feeling for me, didn't quite apologize, which is fine I'd rather feel heard/seen, then get an empty apology. With the understanding that the two of them didn't have more going on and that my partner acknowledged my feelings I left the conversation at that. 

We had some group activities with friends through the week and my partner let me know that they had made plans to go to an event mid day on Saturday with the FWB, and that they would likely hang out for a while after. I appreciated the more upfront communication and had much to do that day. Later in the day I got a text from my partner saying they were considering going to a concert but weren't sure yet and that they'd text when they knew more, the way it was written it seemed like they were going to ask me to go along.

A few hours later I got another text saying that they were going to the concert and they my partner would be home later after that. Along the way my partner was also a date for the FWB to stop in at one of their friend's birthday. Then they went to the concert, and then they went back to the FWB and hung out for a couple more hours with my partner not getting home until quite late. 

I went through a gamut of negative emotions that evening. Again. And this time I was more hurt than the week before. I eventually decide to watch a comfort show to take my mind off things and fell asleep on the couch. 
My partner got home, said hello but I didn't have the energy to engage them or was maybe afraid that I'd slip to rage or to cry. I barely acknowledged they were home, they got ready for bed and came out to see if I was going to as well. I responded that I was fine where I was and to have a good sleep. They came back out to offer to sleep on the couch instead, but I just repeated that I was fine where I was. 

I woke up in the morning still feeling negatively, very down. I went to take a hot hot shower and meditate in the bath. They popped in after I'd been in there for a good 20 minutes already to ask if I wanted anything to eat or coffee and went to go get us something.

We ate together and I popped the seal on my uncomfortable emotions too discuss it with them. I laid out all my feelings and hurt and anger. I pressed them more about disregarding our previous discussions. They shared that they really wanted to go to the concert, but weren't sure because of getting last minute tickets and also because they'd been gone all day already and KNEW that I would be upset about it. They were worried that I was going to tell them not to go to the concert. 

To me it felt even more like my feelings had been purposely disregarded in service of chasing a spark with someone else. I pressed them more about the connection with that FWB and they replied that the two of them hadn't discussed feelings or defined any kind of relationship, and denied that something poly was happening. They did admit that they do feel more for this person than just a FWB and think the other person may as well.

My response to that was that this IS poly, but they were just but wanting to label it and that I felt like I wasn't given a chance to talk about it with my partner at all and they had followed this connection without being up front with me, and then chose to do things they knew would be hurtful or to potentially put be in a position to give them a demand rather than an opportunity for conversation. 

I'm not fundamentally against poly relationships or potentially being poly. I don't know a lot about it personally and don't know many people that have done more than be in a triad. I've only really read The Ethical Slut, but that was years ago.

After spending a good portion of a couple Sundays ago talking, we had some more conversation last week. I shared that from my perspective we need to know more and talk more, I shared that my preference would be for my partner to moderate either the frequency or the length of time of their hanging out with this person, until my partner and I can talk about this more and about what it means for each of us and our relationship.  They pretty much flatly said they didn't feel that was a fair ask, and maybe it's not? My response to that was that if they felt like that ask was unfair that they ensure that they not advance that relationship further until we can talk about things more.

My partner asked me if I would be okay with them seeing the FWB a couple days ago, they went to hike and hang out. It wasnt a 12-15 hour date day this time, maybe only 8 or 9, but was that because it was a Sunday/work night, or because they were being considerate of me? (I know that's a question I should ask my partner)

I absolutely love my partner, and I want the most happiness for the both of us. I feel a little lost though, I don't know what I should be doing next. Should I read other books, what should my partner and I talk about next? Was me asking for them to moderate the length of time OR frequency of their time worth the FWB actually unreasonable?

That kind of weather makes me crave something warm and cozy, so I decided to bake some sweet potatoes at home.

Instead of the usual yellow or chestnut types (which are super common here),  
I picked up a **purple sweet potato** this time.  
It looked too pretty to pass up, and I was curious about its flavor.

I used my small oven to roast them — it takes a bit longer than boiling,  
but it brings out a deeper sweetness and keeps the texture fluffy.  
The color is honestly stunning, almost like violet velvet inside.

I need some advice. I (36F) have been seeing a guy (31M) that I really like. We both have busy schedules and get to see each other once a month. Our first ""unofficial"" date was back in February but due to several issues ( health issues, busy schedules, car accident etc) we didn't see each other again until he came out for my birthday August and have hung out every month since then. We've never talked about ages, I had no candles or anything that gave away my age at my birthday, so I don't think he knows I am older. When he originally texted me in January, I thought it was prank as it was a general happy new year message and I had not heard from or seen him in about 6 years. I replied anyway and he asked me out for coffee. Still thinking it was a joke, I walked in with zero expectations but then we hit it off.

Anyway it's fairly obvious we care about each other and I want to have the ""where do we stand and where are we going/what is our goal"" discussion"" on our next date just to check in and make sure we are still on the same page. We sort of glossed over the topic briefly on our September date but it would be nice to have a proper, meaningful conversation about it. However, I need to establish that he is okay even being with an ""older"" woman first before that conversation can happen. For me, He is incredibly mature so I don't really notice the age gap when we are together. I also look about 10 years younger than my age (still getting carded lol 🙄). How do I bring up the age gap conversation? Can you provide some examples of things I can say? Tips on the where do we stand conversation would be great too actually lol. Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR Seeing a guy who is five years younger. We've never brought up our ages so I don't think he knows I am older. Age is not an issue for me as he is incredibly mature so it never feels like I'm older when we're together. I don't think the age will be an issue for him but I don't want to assume either and would like to bring it up on our next date especially since I'm hoping to check in and have a ""where do we stand and where are we going/what's our goal"" conversation to ensure we're still on same page. I'm looking for tips on how to bring up the age conversation and possibly the where do we stand conversation. Also let me if it's too much to have both conversations on the same date.

And if I should leave her alone.,"Very long story made short: I met this girl in university, we share a couple classes together. We seemed to get on well so I asked her out on a date. We went, had a good time, she said that she didn't want to go on another one for the foreseeable future. Things seemed fine, I asked her two times over the week if she wanted to go grab coffee and hang out after class. But she said she couldn't. I haven't spoken with her much, but when I have, it's been fine from what I can tell. 

Today though I talked to her at one of the classes we had together. She had her friend there who I hadn't met before. Tbh I got a weird vibe from both of them. Like, there was nothing explicitly said. But it felt like I was being monitored by them. Like I was a creep that needed eyes on him. Stuff like weird looks and not really giving off a friendly mood. I don't know, I just felt off. And it's made me think that I'm being bothersome towards her and that I should just leave her be. Which is understandable I guess. I don't have any intentions of pursuing her anymore, but I get that she'd feel uneasy around me. 

But the last thing I want to be is the creepy guy who can't take a hint. But it's impossible for me to know if we're still cool or not. I can't ask because that's seeking reassurance and that's bad; plus I'd probably think she was just being nice and not truthful so that she didn't hurt my feelings. I also can't completely rely on my own analysis because I'm mentally ill and overthink everything. 

Part of me just feels like I should avoid talking to her for a while. But again, I don't know anything.",2,1762305124.0,IncelExit,10,1.0,False

*By Your Humble Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Figure Out Why the Panthers Think “Defending” Is Optional*

---

**Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
The Panthers (-162) are the chalk here, implying a 61.7% chance to win. The Ducks (+136) sit at 58.8%, which feels like a statistical paradox (math, meet existential crisis). But let’s not let numbers fool us—this is less of a hockey game and more of a “Which Team Tripped Less Hard?” contest.

The Panthers’ injuries read like a cast list for *The Walking Dead*: Aleksander Barkov (MVP candidate, out), Matthew Tkachuk (the team’s emotional center, out), and Dmitry Kulikov (defensive anchor, out). They’re down to the third-stringer who still thinks “checking” is a type of coffee. Meanwhile, the Ducks are missing Mikael Granlund and Ryan Strome but have Lukas Dostal, their circus-trained goalie, who recently caught a puck mid-air during a power play *and got a standing ovation from the rafters*.

The total is set at 6 goals, and the over is favored. Considering the Panthers’ defense (which allows goals like a sieve allows water) and the Ducks’ recent shootout prowess, this game might end with someone scoring in overtime while wearing a duck costume.

**Digesting the News: Ducks Soar, Panthers Flap**  
The Ducks are riding a three-game win streak, including a 3-2 shootout victory over these same Panthers just last week. Young guns like Leo Carlsson (6-game point streak) and Cutter Gauthier (sixth-man heroics) are playing like they’ve watched *The Art of War* on loop. Troy Terry, their top-line dynamo, is healthy and smiling—unlike the Panthers’ Sam Bennett, who’s trying to carry a team that’s missing its offensive nucleus.

The Panthers? They’re like a luxury SUV with four flat tires: *technically* functional, but not for lon

1oopa25,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oopa25/i_drove_through_a_town_that_wasnt_on_my_gps_now_i/,I drove through a town that wasn’t on my GPS. Now I can’t leave.,"I’ve been working the same job for six years and haven’t missed a single day. Not one. When my boss told me to take two weeks off before I burned out completely, I didn’t argue. I packed my bag that night, threw it in the back seat, and left before sunrise.

I hadn’t taken a real vacation since college. The plan was simple—drive a few states over, visit my parents, clear my head, and remind myself that life existed outside fluorescent lights and inbox notifications.

The first few hours were exactly what I’d hoped for. The sky was a washed-out gray that softened everything. The world smelled like wet grass. I drank gas station coffee that tasted like cardboard and listened to static-flecked classic rock until I didn’t think about work at all.

By late afternoon, the highways had narrowed into two-lane backroads that weaved through farmland and patches of pine. My GPS lost service sometime after noon, but it didn’t bother me. I had directions printed out, a full tank, and no schedule.

Then I passed the green sign.

It was weathered, half-swallowed by kudzu, and I almost missed it. The white paint was peeling, but I could still make out the letters that read out the county name.

After that, the road curved through the trees for what felt like forever. The canopy grew so thick that sunlight came through in slanted strips, each one pulsing as the car moved beneath it. I rolled the windows down to clear the smell of the engine and felt the air shift—warm, heavy, still.

When the woods finally opened up, I saw it.

A small town sat in the valley ahead, quiet and neat as a painting. The houses were all white with green shutters, the lawns perfectly trimmed. A church steeple rose above everything, and a narrow main street led straight to a diner with a silver roof that caught the last of the daylight.

At the edge of town stood a sign. The paint was fresh, the wood new. It didn’t list a name or population. It only said:

WELCOME HOME.

I slowed the car, smiling at how odd it was to find a place this quaint without a single GPS marker. Maybe it was one of those old forgotten stops that used to sit along the main roads before interstates were built. A few people were out—an old man sweeping a porch, a woman watering flowers. They all turned to look as I passed, and though I couldn’t see their faces clearly, I could tell they were smiling.

The diner was the only place that looked open. A faded neon sign buzzed weakly in the window. I hadn’t eaten since breakfast, so I parked out front and went in.

A bell jingled above the door, and the smell of coffee and frying oil hit me. The place looked spotless—linoleum floors, booths with red leather cushions, framed photographs of old cars and parades. A woman behind the counter smiled before I could say a word.

“Afternoon, sugar. Sit wherever you like.”

Her name tag said EDNA. She looked to be in her fifties, hair curled and pinned, makeup perfect in that old-fashioned way that made her seem almost ageless.

I ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a black coffee. She didn’t write anything down, just said, “Comin’ right up, sweetheart,” and vanished through the kitchen doors.

I sat by the window and watched the town through the glass. The street was nearly empty, but I could feel eyes on me—people glancing from doorways or windows, quickly looking away. It wasn’t threatening, exactly. More like curiosity.

When Edna came back, she set the plate in front of me. “You’re not from around here, are you?”

“Just passing through,” I said, taking a bite. The burger was perfect—juicy, crisp on the edges, cooked exactly how I liked it. “This is great, by the way.”

She smiled, almost shyly. “We aim to please.”

“Is there a road that leads back to the interstate?” I asked. “My GPS kind of died on me.”

“Sure thing. Just take the road you came in on, sweetheart. It’ll take you anywhere you need to go.”

Her tone was casual, but something about the phrasing made my stomach tighten.

I thanked her, paid, and left a few extra bills on the counter. She gave me a small wave through the window as I backed out of the parking lot.

The sun was low, orange light stretching the shadows across the road as I headed out the same way I’d come. The air cooled, the woods thickened again, and for a while, I drove without seeing a single car or sign.

Then I came around a bend and saw the same WELCOME HOME sign again.

At first, I thought I’d made a wrong turn. But I hadn’t taken any turns. I’d gone straight the entire time.

The diner was there. The church. The houses. Everything.

I checked the clock. I’d been driving for almost twenty minutes.

I wasn’t sure what unsettled me more—that I was somehow back where I started, or that the sun hadn’t moved an inch.

I figured it was some kind of weird loop in the road. I’d gotten lost in rural backroads before—twisting routes that looked identical and led you right back where you began. Still, something about this felt… deliberate.

I parked in front of the gas station this time, hoping to ask for directions. The place had an old analog pump and a dusty “Open” sign taped to the door. Inside, a radio played softly from somewhere I couldn’t see.

A man behind the counter looked up as I entered. He was tall, with thinning gray hair slicked straight back and the kind of leathery tan that comes from years outdoors. His name tag said HANK.

“Back so soon?” he asked with a smile.

I frowned. “Sorry?”

He gestured at my car through the window. “Thought you just came through here.”

“I might’ve passed by earlier,” I said, forcing a laugh. “Roads around here loop kind of funny.”

Hank nodded slowly, that same easy smile never leaving his face. “Ain’t but one road through town, friend. The same one you came in on.”

I hesitated. “Yeah, Edna at the diner said that too.”

He chuckled. “Then Edna’s still sharp as ever.”

I bought a bottle of water just for an excuse to stand there. The air inside the station felt heavy, like humidity that wouldn’t lift. When I stepped back outside, the street looked emptier than before. I hadn’t noticed it earlier, but none of the houses had cars in their driveways. Not one.

The trees beyond the edge of town swayed slightly, even though there was no wind.

I decided to try one more time.

This time, I kept count of every curve, every landmark, every mile marker. I even dropped a crumpled napkin out the window as I went, hoping to spot it again if I somehow circled back. The forest grew denser, the road narrower, and I could’ve sworn I saw movement between the trees—a flicker of white, like someone walking parallel to the car.

After fifteen minutes, the woods began to thin. Relief hit me. Then the pavement straightened, and the diner’s silver roof flashed in the distance.

The WELCOME HOME sign stood in the same place. The napkin was gone.

When I drove past the diner, Edna was standing outside, wiping her hands on a rag. She waved like she hadn’t seen me in years. “Back already, sugar?”

I didn’t answer her. I just kept driving through town until I hit the opposite edge, then slowed the car to a stop. I sat there with the engine idling, trying to think.

If the road out of town brought me right back in, maybe the one going the other direction did the same. There had to be another route—something unpaved or hidden. A way that wasn’t marked.

I drove aimlessly for the next half hour. Every road ended in a cul-de-sac or a fence. Every turn circled back toward Main Street. When I finally stopped again, the gas gauge had dropped below half.

The thought came slow but sharp: I could run out of gas before I figured this out.

I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and just sat there. Edna watched me through the window for a long time before coming out.

“You alright, sugar? You look a little lost.”

“Yeah,” I said, rubbing my temples. “I think I took a wrong turn somewhere. Every road I try brings me back here.”

Edna nodded slowly. “Well, these roads’ll do that if you don’t pay close attention. Some of ‘em go where you don’t mean to.”

That didn’t make any sense.

“Is there a map I can borrow? Or maybe someone who can point me toward the interstate?”

“Sure,” she said. “You talk to the sheriff. His office is just across from the church.”

She smiled again—too kindly, too calm—and went back inside before I could ask anything else.

The sheriff’s office was a single-story brick building with a flagpole out front. The flag hung limp in the still air. Inside, the walls were covered in old black-and-white photos—county fairs, hunting groups, smiling faces from decades ago.

A man came out from the back room wearing a tan uniform and a badge that looked more ornamental than functional. He was big, built like a farmhand, with a heavy mustache and a gentle drawl.

“Afternoon,” he said. “Heard you were lookin’ for me.”

I explained what was happening—how I’d tried leaving, how I kept coming back, how I didn’t understand what I was doing wrong. He listened quietly, nodding every so often.

When I finished, he smiled like I was a child who’d asked where the sun went at night.

“Don’t worry yourself,” he said. “These roads play tricks sometimes. Folks get turned around. You just follow the main one till it splits by the old barn a few miles up, take the left fork, and you’ll be back on the highway before you know it.”

“Barn?” I asked. “I haven’t seen any barn.”

He chuckled. “You will now. Sometimes it don’t show till you know to look for it.”

Something about that phrasing sent a ripple down my spine.

Still, I thanked him and left. When I got back into the car, I saw him standing in the doorway, still smiling, still watching.

I drove until dusk. The light through the trees dimmed to a dull bronze, then fell away completely. The road narrowed, dipped, rose again. For a long time, I thought I’d finally broken free. Then the forest opened, and the same WELCOME HOME sign glowed in my headlights.

I stopped the car right there in the road. My heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

The sign looked newer than before. The paint was brighter, the letters sharper.

And the church bell was ringing.

I don’t remember parking. I don’t remember deciding to go inside. I just remember standing in the street as the bell stopped and the town went quiet again.

The diner lights were off. The gas station was dark. But the church doors were open, spilling a pale glow onto the grass.

Inside, candles lined the walls. The air smelled of wax and dust. There were no people, no sound except my shoes on the wooden floorboards.

At the front of the chapel was a small wooden podium, and behind it, a painting—Jesus standing with his arms spread, but the face wasn’t his. The eyes were black, the mouth wrong, stretched in a way that made me step back without meaning to.

I turned and left.

When I got outside, the sky had shifted. It wasn’t night exactly, but it wasn’t dawn either. The clouds looked frozen mid-roll, and everything had that soft gray cast like an old photograph.

I decided to find a place to sleep and try again in the morning. The diner’s sign flickered faintly as I passed.

The motel was small, a single row of rooms with green doors. The clerk behind the desk looked up when I came in.

“You’re the new guest,” he said, not even asking my name. “We don’t get many new faces these days.”

His smile was the same as everyone else’s—warm, fixed, too polite.

“How much for a night?”

“Don’t you worry about that,” he said. “You can settle up when you leave.”

The way he said it made my throat go dry.

The room was clean but outdated—rotary phone, floral bedspread, one of those old TVs that took a minute to warm up. When I turned it on, only static played. But beneath the static, I could swear I heard voices whispering. Not words, just sound.

I turned it off.

At some point, I must have fallen asleep. When I woke up, sunlight was spilling through the curtains. For a brief, blissful second, I thought I’d dreamed everything.

Then I stepped outside.

The car was parked where I’d left it, but the street looked slightly different. The buildings were all the same, but their colors had faded—as if the whole town had been sitting in the sun too long.

When I drove down Main Street, more people were out this time. A man mowing a lawn. Two kids riding bikes. They all waved cheerfully as I passed.

I waved back, then froze.

The kids—they were the same ones I’d seen in the photo at the sheriff’s office. The same clothes. The same smiles.

And when they rode by again, from the opposite direction this time, I realized the dirt on their jeans hadn’t changed either.

They were looping too.

I stopped in front of the diner, though I didn’t plan to. My hands just did it. Edna was there again, wiping down a table by the window.

She looked up, smiled, and mouthed something I couldn’t hear.

I went inside.

“Morning, sugar,” she said brightly. “Coffee?”

My voice came out rough. “Do you remember me?”

She blinked. “Of course. You were in just yesterday.”

“No,” I said. “I mean before that. The first time. Do you remember me asking about leaving?”

Her expression didn’t change, but something in her eyes flickered—just for a second.

“Why would you want to leave?” she asked softly.

The words didn’t sound like hers. The accent was wrong, the tone off.

I didn’t answer. I stood up and left the coffee untouched.

When I got into the car, I turned the radio on without thinking. Static filled the speakers again—but this time, beneath it, there was something else.

My name.

I turned the volume down. The whisper followed, low and patient, threading through the static like a pulse.

Jessie.

The longer I listened, the clearer it became—not a voice outside the signal, but something inside it. A hum that shaped itself into words.

Don’t go.

I slammed the radio off.

The sound didn’t stop.

It was coming from the air vents now, from the engine, from the gravel under the tires when I drove. Every corner of the town seemed to echo that same faint murmur, as if the voice wasn’t in the radio at all—it was in the place.

I tried leaving one more time that night. I drove faster than I should’ve, headlights cutting through the dark, trees blurring on either side. My hands shook so badly I could barely keep the car straight.

When I broke through the last curve, the WELCOME HOME sign came into view again—only now, the letters were smeared, the wood splintered like something had clawed at it.

A figure stood beside it.

It was the sheriff. His hat was gone, his face gray in the high beams. He raised a hand and pointed behind me.

When I looked in the rearview mirror, I saw the diner lights on again. Edna was standing in the doorway.

I’ve stopped trying to leave.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. The sun comes and goes, but I can’t tell if it’s real. The people still wave. They still smile. But I think they’re only doing what they’ve always done. Like they’re stuck in a loop that never ends.

Every time I talk to someone, they seem to know me a little better. The first day, Edna called me sugar. Yesterday, she called me Jessie.

There’s one spot in town that still has service—right here, behind the church, if I hold the phone at an angle and don’t move. I’ve been trying to post this for hours.

If anyone reads this—if anyone knows what this place is—please tell me.

I think the town is remembering me now.

When I walk past windows, I see my reflection smile before I do.

When I drive, the radio whispers home over and over, no matter what station I tune to.

And tonight, when I looked at the church painting again, it wasn’t Jesus anymore.

It was me.

I’m tired. I’ve used up half a tank driving in circles, and the air smells like something sweet and rotting.

If this uploads, know that I tried. I really did.

I’m just going to sit here until it’s over. I don’t think anyone ever really leaves this town.

Not even if you’re just passing by.

--- Story ---

This was the third time I’d sued my husband's mistress.

And this time, he was finally angry.

He didn't come home to plead with me to drop the lawsuit, not like the first two times. Instead, my phone buzzed with the full force of his fury.

""Three years, Bianca. A new lawsuit every year. Don't you think you've made your point?""

His voice was a low growl, stripped of any warmth it once held for me.

""You have no idea what I'm capable of. If it weren't for you, for what we were, I have a million ways to make life hell for anyone who messes with Jaz. I'm warning you. This is the last time.""

The implication was clear: his restraint was a gift. My last gift. Any more trouble, and that restraint would vanish.

A cold laugh escaped my lips. ""Is that a threat, Ethan? Go on. Try and ruin me.""

He wanted a quiet life with his little lover, a neat little happily-ever-after.

I would give him a war instead.

He hung up, the silence on the line as violent as his words.

In turn, I called my lawyer and filed an injunction to freeze all our marital assets.

01

We were married for five years. For three of them, Ethan had treated me like a ghost.

We met in college, the kind of couple everyone pointed to as proof that true love existed. We were the campus sweethearts, the ones destined to make it. It took us five years to get from that campus to the altar.

It took him two years to cheat on me.

She was his new assistant. Jasmine.

I found them. Not in a motel, not in some sordid apartment, but in our home. He had her tucked under his arm, shielding her as if I were the threat.

""Bianca, don't blame her,"" he said, his voice firm. ""This is on me. I started it.""

""Why?"" The word was a shard of glass in my throat. Seven years of my life, undone by a girl who couldn't have been more than twenty-two.

""We were out with clients. Someone slipped something in my drink. If Jaz hadn't been there… I could have lost everything."" His eyes softened as he looked down at her, a wave of tenderness washing over his face. ""She's just a kid, Bianca. An innocent girl. She's with me now. I have to protect her. I can't let her get hurt.""

His words hit me like a physical blow.

Ethan was a self-made man, his success built on a mountain of networking events and schmoozing dinners. I was there for all of it. To help him secure funding, I’d sat through countless dinners with lecherous investors, their hands lingering too long on my arm, their eyes crawling over my skin. I’d smiled through it all, for him. For us.

An innocent girl. Can't let her get hurt.

Was that it? Was I no longer clean in his eyes? Was I tainted by the very world I’d helped him conquer? Was that his excuse to find solace in the arms of his wide-eyed assistant?

Then what were all my sacrifices for? What was I?

02

Ethan didn't show up for the deposition.

But his mistress did.

""Bianca. Name your price. What will it take to make this go away?""

She was dressed head-to-toe in runway-fresh Dior, dripping in jewels that I knew for a fact were not family heirlooms. The timid girl I’d first seen clinging to my husband was gone. In her place stood a woman sculpted by Ethan's money. He had polished her well over the last three years.

""I want to speak with Ethan,"" I said, my voice flat.

A smug smile played on her lips. ""Me being here is his statement. He's sick of you, Bianca. He can't even stand to look at you anymore.""

Her eyes, cold and dismissive, swept over me. ""This has always been about money, right?""

She slid a document across the polished table. A divorce settlement.

""Sign it. I talked to E, and he agreed to be generous. An extra ten million.""

It was our money. Money I had helped him earn. Yet here she was, framing it as a handout, a gift she had magnanimously convinced him to bestow upon me.

I met her gaze, my own eyes turning to ice. ""I said, I'll speak with Ethan.""

""About what? The divorce?"" She let out a light, tinkling laugh. ""You've sued me for three years. And what have you gotten out of it? Nothing. In fact, every time you file a suit, Ethan feels so guilty about what I have to go through. He spoils me even more.""

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""He's bought me cars, condos… a portfolio. Honestly, I should be thanking you. These last three years have been very, very profitable. Two hundred million, all in my name.""

Her gaze was pure condescension. ""Why do you have to be so pathetic? Fifty million is more than fair. Don't be that woman. Take the deal while I'm in a good mood. Sign the papers and walk away."" Her smile tightened. ""Because if you don't, I promise you, what he offers next will be far less.""

He was giving his mistress assets worth hundreds of millions, and offering me fifty million to disappear. I clung to the last shred of my dignity.

""I'm not signing anything. As long as I'm his wife, you'll always be the other woman.""

""You—"" Jasmine's face contorted with rage, and her hand flew towards my face.

I caught her wrist, my grip like steel. ""And as long as I am legally his wife, every single dollar he gave you is marital property. You think you're going to keep that two hundred million? Enjoy it while it lasts.""

""Bianca! Let her go.""

Ethan. He stormed in, his face a thundercloud, and roughly wrenched my arm away, shoving me back. I stumbled, my knee cracking hard against the leg of a chair. A bolt of sharp, searing pain shot up my leg.

He didn't even glance at me. His attention was solely on Jasmine, his hands framing her face, his eyes frantic with a worry he never showed me anymore. ""Are you okay? Did she hurt you?""

The arrogant woman from moments before vanished. Jasmine buried her face in his chest, her shoulders shaking with silent, theatrical sobs.

Ethan's gaze finally found me, and it was utterly devoid of warmth. ""Bianca, what did I tell you? You want to fight, you fight with me. You don't touch her. Haven't you learned anything in the last three years?""

03

That was the incident that changed everything. For slapping his mistress, Ethan didn't just fire me from the executive position I held at our company; he moved out of our home and into hers.

I screamed. I cried. I pleaded. I fell apart.

In response, he blocked my number, blocked my email, and vanished from my life completely.

That was my ""lesson.""

The only way to see him, the only way to force him to face me, was to drag his new life into the harsh light of a courtroom. So I filed suit against Jasmine, for misappropriation of marital assets.

It was the one thing he couldn't ignore. He couldn't stand the thought of her name being dragged through legal proceedings. So he would appear. He would finally see me.

And each time, it was the same. He would demand to know when I was going to stop. He would warn me that next time, he wouldn't be so lenient. He would slide a divorce settlement across the table, his only goal to make her an honest woman.

I stared at him now, the pain in my knee a dull throb. ""What other lessons do you have for me, Ethan? Bring them on. Do you really think there's anything left for me to be afraid of?""

His jaw tightened, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

Jasmine, nestled in his arms, chose that moment to look up, her eyes shimmering with perfectly formed tears. ""E, it's all my fault… I shouldn't have come to see her. I was just so worried about your reputation, about the company you worked so hard to build…""

She pressed her cheek against his chest, her voice choked with emotion. ""I don't care about any of it. The cars, the condos, everything… I'll give it all to her. If she'll just leave you in peace, I'll give up everything…""

It was a masterful performance.

""Bianca, it's been three years,"" Ethan said, his voice heavy with exhaustion. ""Haven't you had enough?""

He looked at me, his eyes dark and clouded. ""You've tortured us for three years. Isn't it time to let go of your anger?""

He had ignored me for three years. Frozen me out for three years. Flaunted his love for another woman for three years. Ground my dignity into dust for three years.

And now he was accusing me of torturing him.

04

A laugh, sharp and brittle, broke from my lips. ""Enough? It's not nearly enough. You want peace, Ethan? You should have thought of that before you destroyed mine. I'm not done. I want everyone to know what you are: a man who betrays his vows. And I want everyone to know what she is: a homewrecker who knew exactly what she was doing.""

""I am going to nail you both to the cross of public opinion.""

Ethan’s expression was one of pure disdain. ""Look at you, Bianca. Listen to yourself. You sound like some unhinged woman screaming on a street corner. What happened to you?""

He shook his head, a cruel smirk on his face. ""And for the record, Jaz is not a homewrecker. In love, Bianca, the one who isn't loved is the other woman.""

So that's what I was to him now. The other woman.

Tears welled, hot and furious, but I refused to let them fall. My hand shot out, grabbing the heavy ceramic coffee mug from the table. With a guttural cry, I hurled it at his head.

""Ah—!"" Jasmine shrieked.

The dark brown liquid mixed with the bright red of his blood, dripping down his temple.

Ethan stared at me, his eyes wide with shock. Three years. We had argued, we had iced each other out, we had lived in a state of cold war for three excruciating years. But this was the first time I had ever laid a hand on him.

He wiped the blood from his brow with the back of his hand and, with a chilling calmness, slapped the divorce papers down on the table once more.

""There. You've hit me, you've had your tantrum. You should feel better now. Sign the papers.""

05

Jasmine stepped toward me, her face a mask of patronizing pity. ""Bianca, please… don't do this to Ethan anymore. Do you really want me to get on my knees and beg you—""

Before she could finish her sentence, I slapped her. Hard. The crack echoed in the silent room.

""A mistress doesn't get a speaking part in this conversation,"" I spat.

As I raised my hand for a second time, Ethan lunged, his fingers clamping around my wrist like a vice. He yanked me back, flinging me away from her. I lost my balance, my head slamming against the sharp corner of the conference table. A warm, wet sensation instantly flooded my hairline.

But he wasn't looking at me.

""Did you forget my warning, Bianca?"" His voice was dangerously low. ""You forced my hand.""

He pulled out his phone and dialed. ""Get all of Bianca's things out of the house. Now. Pack them in a box and leave it on the curb. And change the locks. She is not to set foot on that property again.""

I pressed a hand to my bleeding forehead, staring at him in disbelief. ""Ethan… you told me that was our forever home.""

For a split second, seeing the blood, his brow furrowed. Just a flicker. Then it was gone. He turned his back on me, wrapping a protective arm around Jasmine. ""You brought this on yourself, Bianca. I told you. Come after me, but you leave Jaz out of it.""

He scooped her up into his arms. ""This is the last time I'm going easy on you. You'd be wise to remember that.""

His gaze softened as he looked down at the woman in his arms. ""Jaz, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Let's get you to a doctor.""

A single slap, and she needed a doctor.

I was bleeding freely from my head, and he saw right through me.

Jasmine wrapped her arms around his neck, but her triumphant gaze was locked on me. ""E, what about Bianca? She's hurt, too. Shouldn't you—""

Ethan's voice was like a blade. ""She's an irrelevant person. Not worth my time.""

Ten years of love, erased. I was irrelevant. Not worth his time.

06

I drove home in a daze. Home.

The housekeeper, a woman who had worked for us for years, blocked the doorway. ""Ma'am, Mr. Scott said you're not allowed inside anymore.""

She pointed to a single, small cardboard box sitting on the porch steps. ""He said you could take your personal clothing, but nothing else from the house.""

That small box. Sitting there like a piece of trash.

A low, hysterical laugh bubbled up from my chest. So this was it. This was the grand finale. This was the future I had chosen when I ignored every warning, burned every bridge, and threw my entire life behind one man.

Tears finally blurred my vision. Ethan was a man of his word, after all. One slap was all it took.

He was so cruel. He knew. He knew I had no other family to turn to. He had been my only family. This house was the only anchor I had left.

Why was he doing this? What had I done to deserve this bottomless cruelty?

I don't know how long I stood there, frozen on the sidewalk. Eventually, a car pulled up, and Olivia got out. My best friend. In this entire city, she was the one person I still had.

She took one look at my face, at the box, and her own face hardened. She practically forced me into the passenger seat of her car.

""That son of a bitch,"" she seethed. ""Ethan is a goddamn monster."" She glanced at me, her eyes full of pain. ""Bianca, why are you still holding on to this? You're miserable, and you're making him miserable.""

I stared out the window at the blurry city lights. ""He's not miserable, Liv,"" I rasped. ""He's got his perfect little doll to comfort him.""

Olivia was silent for a long time. ""He's never gone this far before, no matter how bad your fights were. What happened today?""

The tears started again, hot tracks down my cold cheeks. ""I slapped her. His precious Jasmine. Just once.""

Olivia slammed her fist on the steering wheel. ""Bia, don't you think you deserve better? Does it really have to be him?""

I wiped my eyes, a hollow feeling echoing inside me. ""It's not about him anymore, Liv. It's the sheer injustice of it all. The boy who promised me forever under the autumn leaves on the main quad… how did he become this… this cold, cruel stranger? I just want an answer. What does she have that I don't?""

Olivia's voice was laced with a helpless frustration. ""Bia, you're a hundred times the woman she'll ever be. Ethan is blind. He's an idiot."" She paused, trying to find some logic. ""Look, maybe this lawsuit just hit a nerve, maybe he lost a lot of money and he's lashing out. He'll cool down… maybe he'll…""

She trailed off, then tried again. ""He can't feel nothing for you. If he was truly indifferent, why would he let you torment him for three years without ever really fighting back? He never used his real power against you until now…""

""Feelings? Indifferent?"" My laugh was a broken, trembling thing. ""He knows I cut off my family for him. He knows I have nowhere else to go. He promised me that house would always be my home… and today, he threw me out like garbage.""

Olivia's own eyes welled up. ""All those years… from college kids to this… How did it ever come to this?""

That's right. How?

I wanted an answer, too.

07

I spent days in a fog at Olivia's apartment. Finally, she dragged me out of bed.

""Where are we going?"" I asked, my voice listless.

""To get you some justice,"" she replied.

I instinctively recoiled. ""Liv, please. This is between Ethan and me. Don't get involved.""

""I've invited a few of our old friends from college."" She took my cold hand in hers. ""With us there, maybe Ethan will be reminded of the woman you are. The woman he fell in love with.""

""This is a chance for you two to actually talk."" Her voice was soft, full of hope. ""I don't believe that two people who loved each other that fiercely can just… stop. There has to be something left.""

I stood there, stunned. Three years. Over a thousand days. And in every single encounter, every single confrontation, he had said nothing. He would just watch me with those cold eyes, push the divorce papers toward me, and utter the same five brutal words in the same flat tone: ""Just sign it, Bianca.""

Could we really talk?

Olivia's desperate hope on my behalf made my nose sting.

The private room she'd booked was at the same restaurant where Ethan had proposed. Standing outside the door, I felt a dizzying wave of vertigo, as if the past ten years were collapsing in on me. I could almost hear his voice from that night, thick with emotion: ""Bianca, be my girlfriend. I'll love you for the rest of my life.""

Through the door, I could hear the muffled voices of our friends.

""Ethan, has it really come to this? Is divorce the only option?""

""Yeah, man. A woman on the side is one thing, but you don't throw away a marriage like yours.""

""You and Bianca have been through so much. Whatever it is, just work it out. Get it out of your system and go home.""

Then, Ethan's voice, calm and resolute. ""This isn't just a fling. I'm serious about her.""

The room went quiet for a moment. Then someone else spoke. ""I just don't get it, Ethan. I've met your new girlfriend. She's… fine. But in terms of looks, intelligence, capability… she's not in the same league as Bianca. How can you be so obsessed with her?""

Outside the door, my fingers curled into fists. Yes. That was the question. The question that had haunted me for three years. Where did I fall short? What made her so much better?

""You're right. Bianca is superior to Jaz in every way,"" Ethan's voice was unnervingly calm.

""Then why…?""

""That's exactly why,"" Ethan cut in. ""She's too superior. She's independent, strong… she makes it seem like she doesn't need anyone. From household chores to business negotiations, she handles everything perfectly.""

His tone shifted, softening into something almost tender. ""But Jaz is different. She's… clumsy. She burns herself making instant ramen. She gets lost every time she leaves the house. She can never find her phone. If I'm not around, she's a walking disaster—""

He paused, and I could picture the fond smile on his face. ""She needs me. And that feeling, being needed… it fills a space inside me I didn't even know was empty.""

I leaned against the cold wall, a hollow laugh escaping my lips.

So that was it. I hadn't lost to another woman. I had lost to my own damned competence. I had lost to every storm I had weathered on my own.

All those late nights I stayed up with him while he was building his company from scratch.

All those client dinners where I drank until my stomach burned to help him land a deal.

All those days and nights I managed our lives, our home, our world, so he could focus on his dream without a single worry.

Everything I thought was a testament to my love and support… was actually the reason he left.

The irony was so thick it choked me.

I had forged myself into a fortress to protect him, only for him to leave and become the guardian of a delicate, clinging vine.

And in that moment, I finally understood.

It wasn't that I wasn't good enough. It was that I was too good.

Too good for a man like him.",2,1762304894.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1oop9k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oop9k6/i_drove_through_a_town_that_wasnt_on_my_gps_now_i/,I drove through a town that wasn’t on my GPS. Now I can’t leave.,"I’ve been working the same job for six years and haven’t missed a single day. Not one. When my boss told me to take two weeks off before I burned out completely, I didn’t argue. I packed my bag that night, threw it in the back seat, and left before sunrise.

I hadn’t taken a real vacation since college. The plan was simple—drive a few states over, visit my parents, clear my head, and remind myself that life existed outside fluorescent lights and inbox notifications.

The first few hours were exactly what I’d hoped for. The sky was a washed-out gray that softened everything. The world smelled like wet grass. I drank gas station coffee that tasted like cardboard and listened to static-flecked classic rock until I didn’t think about work at all.

By late afternoon, the highways had narrowed into two-lane backroads that weaved through farmland and patches of pine. My GPS lost service sometime after noon, but it didn’t bother me. I had directions printed out, a full tank, and no schedule.

Then I passed the green sign.

It was weathered, half-swallowed by kudzu, and I almost missed it. The white paint was peeling, but I could still make out the letters that read out the county name.

After that, the road curved through the trees for what felt like forever. The canopy grew so thick that sunlight came through in slanted strips, each one pulsing as the car moved beneath it. I rolled the windows down to clear the smell of the engine and felt the air shift—warm, heavy, still.

When the woods finally opened up, I saw it.

A small town sat in the valley ahead, quiet and neat as a painting. The houses were all white with green shutters, the lawns perfectly trimmed. A church steeple rose above everything, and a narrow main street led straight to a diner with a silver roof that caught the last of the daylight.

At the edge of town stood a sign. The paint was fresh, the wood new. It didn’t list a name or population. It only said:

WELCOME HOME.

I slowed the car, smiling at how odd it was to find a place this quaint without a single GPS marker. Maybe it was one of those old forgotten stops that used to sit along the main roads before interstates were built. A few people were out—an old man sweeping a porch, a woman watering flowers. They all turned to look as I passed, and though I couldn’t see their faces clearly, I could tell they were smiling.

The diner was the only place that looked open. A faded neon sign buzzed weakly in the window. I hadn’t eaten since breakfast, so I parked out front and went in.

A bell jingled above the door, and the smell of coffee and frying oil hit me. The place looked spotless—linoleum floors, booths with red leather cushions, framed photographs of old cars and parades. A woman behind the counter smiled before I could say a word.

“Afternoon, sugar. Sit wherever you like.”

Her name tag said EDNA. She looked to be in her fifties, hair curled and pinned, makeup perfect in that old-fashioned way that made her seem almost ageless.

I ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a black coffee. She didn’t write anything down, just said, “Comin’ right up, sweetheart,” and vanished through the kitchen doors.

I sat by the window and watched the town through the glass. The street was nearly empty, but I could feel eyes on me—people glancing from doorways or windows, quickly looking away. It wasn’t threatening, exactly. More like curiosity.

When Edna came back, she set the plate in front of me. “You’re not from around here, are you?”

“Just passing through,” I said, taking a bite. The burger was perfect—juicy, crisp on the edges, cooked exactly how I liked it. “This is great, by the way.”

She smiled, almost shyly. “We aim to please.”

“Is there a road that leads back to the interstate?” I asked. “My GPS kind of died on me.”

“Sure thing. Just take the road you came in on, sweetheart. It’ll take you anywhere you need to go.”

Her tone was casual, but something about the phrasing made my stomach tighten.

I thanked her, paid, and left a few extra bills on the counter. She gave me a small wave through the window as I backed out of the parking lot.

The sun was low, orange light stretching the shadows across the road as I headed out the same way I’d come. The air cooled, the woods thickened again, and for a while, I drove without seeing a single car or sign.

Then I came around a bend and saw the same WELCOME HOME sign again.

At first, I thought I’d made a wrong turn. But I hadn’t taken any turns. I’d gone straight the entire time.

The diner was there. The church. The houses. Everything.

I checked the clock. I’d been driving for almost twenty minutes.

I wasn’t sure what unsettled me more—that I was somehow back where I started, or that the sun hadn’t moved an inch.

I figured it was some kind of weird loop in the road. I’d gotten lost in rural backroads before—twisting routes that looked identical and led you right back where you began. Still, something about this felt… deliberate.

I parked in front of the gas station this time, hoping to ask for directions. The place had an old analog pump and a dusty “Open” sign taped to the door. Inside, a radio played softly from somewhere I couldn’t see.

A man behind the counter looked up as I entered. He was tall, with thinning gray hair slicked straight back and the kind of leathery tan that comes from years outdoors. His name tag said HANK.

“Back so soon?” he asked with a smile.

I frowned. “Sorry?”

He gestured at my car through the window. “Thought you just came through here.”

“I might’ve passed by earlier,” I said, forcing a laugh. “Roads around here loop kind of funny.”

Hank nodded slowly, that same easy smile never leaving his face. “Ain’t but one road through town, friend. The same one you came in on.”

I hesitated. “Yeah, Edna at the diner said that too.”

He chuckled. “Then Edna’s still sharp as ever.”

I bought a bottle of water just for an excuse to stand there. The air inside the station felt heavy, like humidity that wouldn’t lift. When I stepped back outside, the street looked emptier than before. I hadn’t noticed it earlier, but none of the houses had cars in their driveways. Not one.

The trees beyond the edge of town swayed slightly, even though there was no wind.

I decided to try one more time.

This time, I kept count of every curve, every landmark, every mile marker. I even dropped a crumpled napkin out the window as I went, hoping to spot it again if I somehow circled back. The forest grew denser, the road narrower, and I could’ve sworn I saw movement between the trees—a flicker of white, like someone walking parallel to the car.

After fifteen minutes, the woods began to thin. Relief hit me. Then the pavement straightened, and the diner’s silver roof flashed in the distance.

The WELCOME HOME sign stood in the same place. The napkin was gone.

When I drove past the diner, Edna was standing outside, wiping her hands on a rag. She waved like she hadn’t seen me in years. “Back already, sugar?”

I didn’t answer her. I just kept driving through town until I hit the opposite edge, then slowed the car to a stop. I sat there with the engine idling, trying to think.

If the road out of town brought me right back in, maybe the one going the other direction did the same. There had to be another route—something unpaved or hidden. A way that wasn’t marked.

I drove aimlessly for the next half hour. Every road ended in a cul-de-sac or a fence. Every turn circled back toward Main Street. When I finally stopped again, the gas gauge had dropped below half.

The thought came slow but sharp: I could run out of gas before I figured this out.

I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and just sat there. Edna watched me through the window for a long time before coming out.

“You alright, sugar? You look a little lost.”

“Yeah,” I said, rubbing my temples. “I think I took a wrong turn somewhere. Every road I try brings me back here.”

Edna nodded slowly. “Well, these roads’ll do that if you don’t pay close attention. Some of ‘em go where you don’t mean to.”

That didn’t make any sense.

“Is there a map I can borrow? Or maybe someone who can point me toward the interstate?”

“Sure,” she said. “You talk to the sheriff. His office is just across from the church.”

She smiled again—too kindly, too calm—and went back inside before I could ask anything else.

The sheriff’s office was a single-story brick building with a flagpole out front. The flag hung limp in the still air. Inside, the walls were covered in old black-and-white photos—county fairs, hunting groups, smiling faces from decades ago.

A man came out from the back room wearing a tan uniform and a badge that looked more ornamental than functional. He was big, built like a farmhand, with a heavy mustache and a gentle drawl.

“Afternoon,” he said. “Heard you were lookin’ for me.”

I explained what was happening—how I’d tried leaving, how I kept coming back, how I didn’t understand what I was doing wrong. He listened quietly, nodding every so often.

When I finished, he smiled like I was a child who’d asked where the sun went at night.

“Don’t worry yourself,” he said. “These roads play tricks sometimes. Folks get turned around. You just follow the main one till it splits by the old barn a few miles up, take the left fork, and you’ll be back on the highway before you know it.”

“Barn?” I asked. “I haven’t seen any barn.”

He chuckled. “You will now. Sometimes it don’t show till you know to look for it.”

Something about that phrasing sent a ripple down my spine.

Still, I thanked him and left. When I got back into the car, I saw him standing in the doorway, still smiling, still watching.

I drove until dusk. The light through the trees dimmed to a dull bronze, then fell away completely. The road narrowed, dipped, rose again. For a long time, I thought I’d finally broken free. Then the forest opened, and the same WELCOME HOME sign glowed in my headlights.

I stopped the car right there in the road. My heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

The sign looked newer than before. The paint was brighter, the letters sharper.

And the church bell was ringing.

I don’t remember parking. I don’t remember deciding to go inside. I just remember standing in the street as the bell stopped and the town went quiet again.

The diner lights were off. The gas station was dark. But the church doors were open, spilling a pale glow onto the grass.

Inside, candles lined the walls. The air smelled of wax and dust. There were no people, no sound except my shoes on the wooden floorboards.

At the front of the chapel was a small wooden podium, and behind it, a painting—Jesus standing with his arms spread, but the face wasn’t his. The eyes were black, the mouth wrong, stretched in a way that made me step back without meaning to.

I turned and left.

When I got outside, the sky had shifted. It wasn’t night exactly, but it wasn’t dawn either. The clouds looked frozen mid-roll, and everything had that soft gray cast like an old photograph.

I decided to find a place to sleep and try again in the morning. The diner’s sign flickered faintly as I passed.

The motel was small, a single row of rooms with green doors. The clerk behind the desk looked up when I came in.

“You’re the new guest,” he said, not even asking my name. “We don’t get many new faces these days.”

His smile was the same as everyone else’s—warm, fixed, too polite.

“How much for a night?”

“Don’t you worry about that,” he said. “You can settle up when you leave.”

The way he said it made my throat go dry.

The room was clean but outdated—rotary phone, floral bedspread, one of those old TVs that took a minute to warm up. When I turned it on, only static played. But beneath the static, I could swear I heard voices whispering. Not words, just sound.

I turned it off.

At some point, I must have fallen asleep. When I woke up, sunlight was spilling through the curtains. For a brief, blissful second, I thought I’d dreamed everything.

Then I stepped outside.

The car was parked where I’d left it, but the street looked slightly different. The buildings were all the same, but their colors had faded—as if the whole town had been sitting in the sun too long.

When I drove down Main Street, more people were out this time. A man mowing a lawn. Two kids riding bikes. They all waved cheerfully as I passed.

I waved back, then froze.

The kids—they were the same ones I’d seen in the photo at the sheriff’s office. The same clothes. The same smiles.

And when they rode by again, from the opposite direction this time, I realized the dirt on their jeans hadn’t changed either.

They were looping too.

I stopped in front of the diner, though I didn’t plan to. My hands just did it. Edna was there again, wiping down a table by the window.

She looked up, smiled, and mouthed something I couldn’t hear.

I went inside.

“Morning, sugar,” she said brightly. “Coffee?”

My voice came out rough. “Do you remember me?”

She blinked. “Of course. You were in just yesterday.”

“No,” I said. “I mean before that. The first time. Do you remember me asking about leaving?”

Her expression didn’t change, but something in her eyes flickered—just for a second.

“Why would you want to leave?” she asked softly.

The words didn’t sound like hers. The accent was wrong, the tone off.

I didn’t answer. I stood up and left the coffee untouched.

When I got into the car, I turned the radio on without thinking. Static filled the speakers again—but this time, beneath it, there was something else.

My name.

I turned the volume down. The whisper followed, low and patient, threading through the static like a pulse.

Jessie.

The longer I listened, the clearer it became—not a voice outside the signal, but something inside it. A hum that shaped itself into words.

Don’t go.

I slammed the radio off.

The sound didn’t stop.

It was coming from the air vents now, from the engine, from the gravel under the tires when I drove. Every corner of the town seemed to echo that same faint murmur, as if the voice wasn’t in the radio at all—it was in the place.

I tried leaving one more time that night. I drove faster than I should’ve, headlights cutting through the dark, trees blurring on either side. My hands shook so badly I could barely keep the car straight.

When I broke through the last curve, the WELCOME HOME sign came into view again—only now, the letters were smeared, the wood splintered like something had clawed at it.

A figure stood beside it.

It was the sheriff. His hat was gone, his face gray in the high beams. He raised a hand and pointed behind me.

When I looked in the rearview mirror, I saw the diner lights on again. Edna was standing in the doorway.

I’ve stopped trying to leave.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. The sun comes and goes, but I can’t tell if it’s real. The people still wave. They still smile. But I think they’re only doing what they’ve always done. Like they’re stuck in a loop that never ends.

Every time I talk to someone, they seem to know me a little better. The first day, Edna called me sugar. Yesterday, she called me Jessie.

There’s one spot in town that still has service—right here, behind the church, if I hold the phone at an angle and don’t move. I’ve been trying to post this for hours.

If anyone reads this—if anyone knows what this place is—please tell me.

I think the town is remembering me now.

When I walk past windows, I see my reflection smile before I do.

When I drive, the radio whispers home over and over, no matter what station I tune to.

And tonight, when I looked at the church painting again, it wasn’t Jesus anymore.

It was me.

I’m tired. I’ve used up half a tank driving in circles, and the air smells like something sweet and rotting.

If this uploads, know that I tried. I really did.

I’m just going to sit here until it’s over. I don’t think anyone ever really leaves this town.

--- Story ---

This was the third time I’d sued my husband's mistress.

And this time, he was finally angry.

He didn't come home to plead with me to drop the lawsuit, not like the first two times. Instead, my phone buzzed with the full force of his fury.

""Three years, Bianca. A new lawsuit every year. Don't you think you've made your point?""

His voice was a low growl, stripped of any warmth it once held for me.

""You have no idea what I'm capable of. If it weren't for you, for what we were, I have a million ways to make life hell for anyone who messes with Jaz. I'm warning you. This is the last time.""

The implication was clear: his restraint was a gift. My last gift. Any more trouble, and that restraint would vanish.

A cold laugh escaped my lips. ""Is that a threat, Ethan? Go on. Try and ruin me.""

He wanted a quiet life with his little lover, a neat little happily-ever-after.

I would give him a war instead.

He hung up, the silence on the line as violent as his words.

In turn, I called my lawyer and filed an injunction to freeze all our marital assets.

01

We were married for five years. For three of them, Ethan had treated me like a ghost.

We met in college, the kind of couple everyone pointed to as proof that true love existed. We were the campus sweethearts, the ones destined to make it. It took us five years to get from that campus to the altar.

It took him two years to cheat on me.

She was his new assistant. Jasmine.

I found them. Not in a motel, not in some sordid apartment, but in our home. He had her tucked under his arm, shielding her as if I were the threat.

""Bianca, don't blame her,"" he said, his voice firm. ""This is on me. I started it.""

""Why?"" The word was a shard of glass in my throat. Seven years of my life, undone by a girl who couldn't have been more than twenty-two.

""We were out with clients. Someone slipped something in my drink. If Jaz hadn't been there… I could have lost everything."" His eyes softened as he looked down at her, a wave of tenderness washing over his face. ""She's just a kid, Bianca. An innocent girl. She's with me now. I have to protect her. I can't let her get hurt.""

His words hit me like a physical blow.

Ethan was a self-made man, his success built on a mountain of networking events and schmoozing dinners. I was there for all of it. To help him secure funding, I’d sat through countless dinners with lecherous investors, their hands lingering too long on my arm, their eyes crawling over my skin. I’d smiled through it all, for him. For us.

An innocent girl. Can't let her get hurt.

Was that it? Was I no longer clean in his eyes? Was I tainted by the very world I’d helped him conquer? Was that his excuse to find solace in the arms of his wide-eyed assistant?

Then what were all my sacrifices for? What was I?

02

Ethan didn't show up for the deposition.

But his mistress did.

""Bianca. Name your price. What will it take to make this go away?""

She was dressed head-to-toe in runway-fresh Dior, dripping in jewels that I knew for a fact were not family heirlooms. The timid girl I’d first seen clinging to my husband was gone. In her place stood a woman sculpted by Ethan's money. He had polished her well over the last three years.

""I want to speak with Ethan,"" I said, my voice flat.

A smug smile played on her lips. ""Me being here is his statement. He's sick of you, Bianca. He can't even stand to look at you anymore.""

Her eyes, cold and dismissive, swept over me. ""This has always been about money, right?""

She slid a document across the polished table. A divorce settlement.

""Sign it. I talked to E, and he agreed to be generous. An extra ten million.""

It was our money. Money I had helped him earn. Yet here she was, framing it as a handout, a gift she had magnanimously convinced him to bestow upon me.

I met her gaze, my own eyes turning to ice. ""I said, I'll speak with Ethan.""

""About what? The divorce?"" She let out a light, tinkling laugh. ""You've sued me for three years. And what have you gotten out of it? Nothing. In fact, every time you file a suit, Ethan feels so guilty about what I have to go through. He spoils me even more.""

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""He's bought me cars, condos… a portfolio. Honestly, I should be thanking you. These last three years have been very, very profitable. Two hundred million, all in my name.""

Her gaze was pure condescension. ""Why do you have to be so pathetic? Fifty million is more than fair. Don't be that woman. Take the deal while I'm in a good mood. Sign the papers and walk away."" Her smile tightened. ""Because if you don't, I promise you, what he offers next will be far less.""

He was giving his mistress assets worth hundreds of millions, and offering me fifty million to disappear. I clung to the last shred of my dignity.

""I'm not signing anything. As long as I'm his wife, you'll always be the other woman.""

""You—"" Jasmine's face contorted with rage, and her hand flew towards my face.

I caught her wrist, my grip like steel. ""And as long as I am legally his wife, every single dollar he gave you is marital property. You think you're going to keep that two hundred million? Enjoy it while it lasts.""

""Bianca! Let her go.""

Ethan. He stormed in, his face a thundercloud, and roughly wrenched my arm away, shoving me back. I stumbled, my knee cracking hard against the leg of a chair. A bolt of sharp, searing pain shot up my leg.

He didn't even glance at me. His attention was solely on Jasmine, his hands framing her face, his eyes frantic with a worry he never showed me anymore. ""Are you okay? Did she hurt you?""

The arrogant woman from moments before vanished. Jasmine buried her face in his chest, her shoulders shaking with silent, theatrical sobs.

Ethan's gaze finally found me, and it was utterly devoid of warmth. ""Bianca, what did I tell you? You want to fight, you fight with me. You don't touch her. Haven't you learned anything in the last three years?""

03

That was the incident that changed everything. For slapping his mistress, Ethan didn't just fire me from the executive position I held at our company; he moved out of our home and into hers.

I screamed. I cried. I pleaded. I fell apart.

In response, he blocked my number, blocked my email, and vanished from my life completely.

That was my ""lesson.""

The only way to see him, the only way to force him to face me, was to drag his new life into the harsh light of a courtroom. So I filed suit against Jasmine, for misappropriation of marital assets.

It was the one thing he couldn't ignore. He couldn't stand the thought of her name being dragged through legal proceedings. So he would appear. He would finally see me.

And each time, it was the same. He would demand to know when I was going to stop. He would warn me that next time, he wouldn't be so lenient. He would slide a divorce settlement across the table, his only goal to make her an honest woman.

I stared at him now, the pain in my knee a dull throb. ""What other lessons do you have for me, Ethan? Bring them on. Do you really think there's anything left for me to be afraid of?""

His jaw tightened, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

Jasmine, nestled in his arms, chose that moment to look up, her eyes shimmering with perfectly formed tears. ""E, it's all my fault… I shouldn't have come to see her. I was just so worried about your reputation, about the company you worked so hard to build…""

She pressed her cheek against his chest, her voice choked with emotion. ""I don't care about any of it. The cars, the condos, everything… I'll give it all to her. If she'll just leave you in peace, I'll give up everything…""

It was a masterful performance.

""Bianca, it's been three years,"" Ethan said, his voice heavy with exhaustion. ""Haven't you had enough?""

He looked at me, his eyes dark and clouded. ""You've tortured us for three years. Isn't it time to let go of your anger?""

He had ignored me for three years. Frozen me out for three years. Flaunted his love for another woman for three years. Ground my dignity into dust for three years.

And now he was accusing me of torturing him.

A laugh, sharp and brittle, broke from my lips. ""Enough? It's not nearly enough. You want peace, Ethan? You should have thought of that before you destroyed mine. I'm not done. I want everyone to know what you are: a man who betrays his vows. And I want everyone to know what she is: a homewrecker who knew exactly what she was doing.""

""I am going to nail you both to the cross of public opinion.""

Ethan’s expression was one of pure disdain. ""Look at you, Bianca. Listen to yourself. You sound like some unhinged woman screaming on a street corner. What happened to you?""

He shook his head, a cruel smirk on his face. ""And for the record, Jaz is not a homewrecker. In love, Bianca, the one who isn't loved is the other woman.""

So that's what I was to him now. The other woman.

Tears welled, hot and furious, but I refused to let them fall. My hand shot out, grabbing the heavy ceramic coffee mug from the table. With a guttural cry, I hurled it at his head.

""Ah—!"" Jasmine shrieked.

The dark brown liquid mixed with the bright red of his blood, dripping down his temple.

Ethan stared at me, his eyes wide with shock. Three years. We had argued, we had iced each other out, we had lived in a state of cold war for three excruciating years. But this was the first time I had ever laid a hand on him.

He wiped the blood from his brow with the back of his hand and, with a chilling calmness, slapped the divorce papers down on the table once more.

""There. You've hit me, you've had your tantrum. You should feel better now. Sign the papers.""

Jasmine stepped toward me, her face a mask of patronizing pity. ""Bianca, please… don't do this to Ethan anymore. Do you really want me to get on my knees and beg you—""

Before she could finish her sentence, I slapped her. Hard. The crack echoed in the silent room.

""A mistress doesn't get a speaking part in this conversation,"" I spat.

As I raised my hand for a second time, Ethan lunged, his fingers clamping around my wrist like a vice. He yanked me back, flinging me away from her. I lost my balance, my head slamming against the sharp corner of the conference table. A warm, wet sensation instantly flooded my hairline.

But he wasn't looking at me.

""Did you forget my warning, Bianca?"" His voice was dangerously low. ""You forced my hand.""

He pulled out his phone and dialed. ""Get all of Bianca's things out of the house. Now. Pack them in a box and leave it on the curb. And change the locks. She is not to set foot on that property again.""

I pressed a hand to my bleeding forehead, staring at him in disbelief. ""Ethan… you told me that was our forever home.""

For a split second, seeing the blood, his brow furrowed. Just a flicker. Then it was gone. He turned his back on me, wrapping a protective arm around Jasmine. ""You brought this on yourself, Bianca. I told you. Come after me, but you leave Jaz out of it.""

He scooped her up into his arms. ""This is the last time I'm going easy on you. You'd be wise to remember that.""

His gaze softened as he looked down at the woman in his arms. ""Jaz, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Let's get you to a doctor.""

A single slap, and she needed a doctor.

I was bleeding freely from my head, and he saw right through me.

Jasmine wrapped her arms around his neck, but her triumphant gaze was locked on me. ""E, what about Bianca? She's hurt, too. Shouldn't you—""

Ethan's voice was like a blade. ""She's an irrelevant person. Not worth my time.""

Ten years of love, erased. I was irrelevant. Not worth his time.

I drove home in a daze. Home.

The housekeeper, a woman who had worked for us for years, blocked the doorway. ""Ma'am, Mr. Scott said you're not allowed inside anymore.""

She pointed to a single, small cardboard box sitting on the porch steps. ""He said you could take your personal clothing, but nothing else from the house.""

That small box. Sitting there like a piece of trash.

A low, hysterical laugh bubbled up from my chest. So this was it. This was the grand finale. This was the future I had chosen when I ignored every warning, burned every bridge, and threw my entire life behind one man.

Tears finally blurred my vision. Ethan was a man of his word, after all. One slap was all it took.

He was so cruel. He knew. He knew I had no other family to turn to. He had been my only family. This house was the only anchor I had left.

Why was he doing this? What had I done to deserve this bottomless cruelty?

I don't know how long I stood there, frozen on the sidewalk. Eventually, a car pulled up, and Olivia got out. My best friend. In this entire city, she was the one person I still had.

She took one look at my face, at the box, and her own face hardened. She practically forced me into the passenger seat of her car.

""That son of a bitch,"" she seethed. ""Ethan is a goddamn monster."" She glanced at me, her eyes full of pain. ""Bianca, why are you still holding on to this? You're miserable, and you're making him miserable.""

I stared out the window at the blurry city lights. ""He's not miserable, Liv,"" I rasped. ""He's got his perfect little doll to comfort him.""

Olivia was silent for a long time. ""He's never gone this far before, no matter how bad your fights were. What happened today?""

The tears started again, hot tracks down my cold cheeks. ""I slapped her. His precious Jasmine. Just once.""

Olivia slammed her fist on the steering wheel. ""Bia, don't you think you deserve better? Does it really have to be him?""

I wiped my eyes, a hollow feeling echoing inside me. ""It's not about him anymore, Liv. It's the sheer injustice of it all. The boy who promised me forever under the autumn leaves on the main quad… how did he become this… this cold, cruel stranger? I just want an answer. What does she have that I don't?""

Olivia's voice was laced with a helpless frustration. ""Bia, you're a hundred times the woman she'll ever be. Ethan is blind. He's an idiot."" She paused, trying to find some logic. ""Look, maybe this lawsuit just hit a nerve, maybe he lost a lot of money and he's lashing out. He'll cool down… maybe he'll…""

She trailed off, then tried again. ""He can't feel nothing for you. If he was truly indifferent, why would he let you torment him for three years without ever really fighting back? He never used his real power against you until now…""

""Feelings? Indifferent?"" My laugh was a broken, trembling thing. ""He knows I cut off my family for him. He knows I have nowhere else to go. He promised me that house would always be my home… and today, he threw me out like garbage.""

Olivia's own eyes welled up. ""All those years… from college kids to this… How did it ever come to this?""

That's right. How?

I wanted an answer, too.

07

I spent days in a fog at Olivia's apartment. Finally, she dragged me out of bed.

""Where are we going?"" I asked, my voice listless.

""To get you some justice,"" she replied.

I instinctively recoiled. ""Liv, please. This is between Ethan and me. Don't get involved.""

""I've invited a few of our old friends from college."" She took my cold hand in hers. ""With us there, maybe Ethan will be reminded of the woman you are. The woman he fell in love with.""

""This is a chance for you two to actually talk."" Her voice was soft, full of hope. ""I don't believe that two people who loved each other that fiercely can just… stop. There has to be something left.""

I stood there, stunned. Three years. Over a thousand days. And in every single encounter, every single confrontation, he had said nothing. He would just watch me with those cold eyes, push the divorce papers toward me, and utter the same five brutal words in the same flat tone: ""Just sign it, Bianca.""

Could we really talk?

Olivia's desperate hope on my behalf made my nose sting.

The private room she'd booked was at the same restaurant where Ethan had proposed. Standing outside the door, I felt a dizzying wave of vertigo, as if the past ten years were collapsing in on me. I could almost hear his voice from that night, thick with emotion: ""Bianca, be my girlfriend. I'll love you for the rest of my life.""

Through the door, I could hear the muffled voices of our friends.

""Ethan, has it really come to this? Is divorce the only option?""

""Yeah, man. A woman on the side is one thing, but you don't throw away a marriage like yours.""

""You and Bianca have been through so much. Whatever it is, just work it out. Get it out of your system and go home.""

Then, Ethan's voice, calm and resolute. ""This isn't just a fling. I'm serious about her.""

The room went quiet for a moment. Then someone else spoke. ""I just don't get it, Ethan. I've met your new girlfriend. She's… fine. But in terms of looks, intelligence, capability… she's not in the same league as Bianca. How can you be so obsessed with her?""

Outside the door, my fingers curled into fists. Yes. That was the question. The question that had haunted me for three years. Where did I fall short? What made her so much better?

""You're right. Bianca is superior to Jaz in every way,"" Ethan's voice was unnervingly calm.

""Then why…?""

""That's exactly why,"" Ethan cut in. ""She's too superior. She's independent, strong… she makes it seem like she doesn't need anyone. From household chores to business negotiations, she handles everything perfectly.""

His tone shifted, softening into something almost tender. ""But Jaz is different. She's… clumsy. She burns herself making instant ramen. She gets lost every time she leaves the house. She can never find her phone. If I'm not around, she's a walking disaster—""

He paused, and I could picture the fond smile on his face. ""She needs me. And that feeling, being needed… it fills a space inside me I didn't even know was empty.""

I leaned against the cold wall, a hollow laugh escaping my lips.

So that was it. I hadn't lost to another woman. I had lost to my own damned competence. I had lost to every storm I had weathered on my own.

All those late nights I stayed up with him while he was building his company from scratch.

All those client dinners where I drank until my stomach burned to help him land a deal.

All those days and nights I managed our lives, our home, our world, so he could focus on his dream without a single worry.

Everything I thought was a testament to my love and support… was actually the reason he left.

The irony was so thick it choked me.

I had forged myself into a fortress to protect him, only for him to leave and become the guardian of a delicate, clinging vine.

And in that moment, I finally understood.

It wasn't that I wasn't good enough. It was that I was too good.

Too good for a man like him.",1,1762304866.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
