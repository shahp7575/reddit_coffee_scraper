1p1676k,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1p1676k/my_egg_freezing_experience/,My egg freezing experience,"Completed my first round of egg freezing and wanted to share my experience, this community helped me throughout the process so I’d like to share what it was like for me!

Baseline stats were AMH 9.3pmol/l and AFC 19, and I turned 35 in September so I started the treatment when I was 35 and 1 month old. I was disappointed by my AFC because when I had my first scan in August I had 24 resting follicles, but I was told by the nurse that 19 was a good number for my age. 

I took 300 Gonal F for 12 days, ganirelix for 6 days and then buserelin trigger. I stimmed for 12 days in total. 

Experience:

Overall I found the entire experience very manageable with minimal side effects. I did not have any mood swings and barely any pain. Initially, I felt very out of it and confused and I made a lot of mistakes and forgot things, I felt vulnerable being out and about by myself because I at times forgot where I was and found it hard to concentrate. Im not someone who usually feels like this so it was a weird experience for me! But I got used to it and the injections got easier as the time went on and these symptoms reduced a lot. Administering the injections themselves were very easy. This is something I had worried about before but after the first injection it was alright. 

Response to meds:

My response to the meds was both good and not so good. Of my 19 follicles, 18 grew in response to the medication, which I was told was great. The growth started fast though, and then it slowed down and plateaud. By day 10 they said I had to come in for an additional scan as they thought I might need to stim for longer. However, on day 11 & 12 I had a lot of rapid growth and my largest follicle went from 15mm to 25mm in two days. There were 4 which stayed at 6mm but the nurse said that all the others were in the running for retrieval. Over that weekend, I had a lot of breast pain and I wanted to stay in bed and rest, which I did, and it helped. I made sure to eat more food than I normally would and to make sure I was getting lots of healthy fats and protein, as this made me feel better. 

Procedure:

I was really nervous during the egg collection procedure, however the nurses were really supportive and helped me to feel a bit calmer. The anaesthetist explained the process of sedation and once he gave me the medication I soon felt really drowsy and I fell asleep after about 20 seconds. The medicine tasted like butterscotch lol. I woke up and didn’t know where I was or what was happening and I had to ask the team what was going on and where I was. I had bled onto the chair and I felt pain like period cramps. I went back to my room and I drank water, had biscuits and a coffee, then I went to the toilet and could pee a bit. I quite quickly regained my consciousness and the drowsiness subsided and I could leave to wait for my mum to pick me up from the waiting room. 

Eggs retrieved:

Disappointingly the doctor only retrieved 7 eggs. I was upset and tearful at this when she told me and I had hoped I would get around 10 due to the size of my follicles. However, of those 7 eggs retrieved, 6 were mature, which I am really pleased about because they said about 60-70% of eggs tend to be mature. Given my fairly low AMH, I was anticipating having to do two rounds, but had hoped I wouldn’t need to given my quite decent AFC. My plan is to enjoy my Christmas and reevaluate in the new year and make plans for a second round, if I want to, after some time has passed. 

Overall, the experience has been really positive and easy for me. I would feel comfortable doing it again and the only thing holding me back a bit is the cost, though I am in a lucky position to  be able to pay for it as I have some savings. I was lucky that my mum paid for this round for me and I count myself lucky that I have the freedom of choice to do it twice. My clinic says that with 6 mature eggs I have around a 45% chance of a baby. 

I would encourage anyone considering egg freezing not to be dissuaded by the difficult experiences that some women have with the procedure. It feels as though it really varies person to person, but my worries about the process before didn’t turn out to be reality for me.

I'm so confused by the color to pick as the primary color for the kitchen cabinets and need some help so I'm not clashing with the floors - looking for a white/greige to pull from the coolness of the floors in the Benjamin Moore line. I currently picked Swiss coffee, but am now overthinking the decision becuase I'm concerned it will be too warm with the floors. 

I've also included a shot of the quartz we have picked out, which will extend up the wall. The paint chips sitting on the quartz are Swiss Coffee and Chantilly Lace - the current front-runner for the walls (again I think this might be too harsh for the house- but open to opinions)

Chapter 1

After the divorce, I left Las Vegas without a moment's hesitation.

I headed to Dubai alone, ready to start anew.

Over time, I carved out a name for myself in the shadowy world of Middle Eastern arms dealing.

Then, whispers from Las Vegas reached me: my ex-husband, Augustine Clayton, was about to get engaged to his little mistress.

I ran my fingers over the bullet pendant around my neck.

Eight years ago, during a brutal gang shootout, he'd taken that bullet for me. It had grazed perilously close to his heart, missing by a hair's breadth.

Once the surgeons pulled it out, he fashioned it into a necklace and slipped it around my neck.

His voice was soft, almost tender, as he whispered, ""From now on, my life is yours.""

Snapping back to the present, I yanked the chain off without a second thought and tossed it into the trash.

Back then, everyone sneered that I was just some prize Augustine had won at the casino tables—that without him, I'd be nothing.

Seven years later, I returned to Las Vegas to open a new mine.

At the negotiation table, Augustine, who ruled half the city, locked eyes with me, and in that instant, tears welled up in his eyes.

I, however, remembered what had happened at his father's funeral seven years earlier.

That day, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his mistress, letting her play the part of his wife, graciously accepting condolences from family and friends.

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.

I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.

""Sign them.""

Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.

Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.

""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.

""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""

Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.

""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""

I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.

All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.

I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.

After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.

""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""

I nudged the divorce papers forward again.

Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""

Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.

He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""

I didn't look away until his figure faded.

Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.

His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.

And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.

Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.

When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.

""Kassandra,"" he called out.

My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.

""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""

I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.

""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.

""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""

Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.

I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.

His face darkened in an instant.

""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.

""Augustine!""

His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.

""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""

""Get the hell off me!""

Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.

Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.

Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.

I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.

In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.

""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.

I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.

Chapter 2

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.

He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.

I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.

Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.

I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.

There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.

The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.

""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""

Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.

""Looks like you still don't get it.

""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""

I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.

Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.

""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""

I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.

""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.

""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""

I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.

For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.

By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.

Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.

""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""

His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.

I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""

His eyes blazed with arctic rage.

""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""

It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.

""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.

Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.

In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.

Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.

Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.

I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.

Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.

But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.

I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.

During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.

On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.

After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.

""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.

She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.

""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.

""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.

""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""

The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.

In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.

""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""

It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.

These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.

I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.

""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.

I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""

Chapter 3

When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.

I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.

A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.

Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.

She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""

I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.

Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.

My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.

As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.

""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.

""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.

She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""

""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""

I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""

Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""

That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.

I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.

Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""

My hand froze midair.

I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.

Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""

I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.

""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""

I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.

""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.

""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""

The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.

Augustine showed up with Cecilia on his arm, stealing the spotlight the moment they walked in.

When I entered the hall, I overheard him introducing Cecilia to the investors as his woman.

Someone spotted me and greeted, ""Mrs. Clayton!""

""Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clayton,"" Cecilia mocked, her tone sugary and cruel. ""That dress looks a little... modest for the occasion, doesn't it?""

I lifted my hand slightly, revealing the emerald ring that symbolized my status as Augustine's wife. ""What I wear doesn't matter,"" I said coolly. ""What matters is that everyone here knows exactly who Mrs. Clayton is.

""Men like to have their fun sometimes. Ms. Webster, not everyone has your... devotion—content to be a mistress for life.""

Onstage, the host invited Augustine and his wife to unveil the centerpiece.

Augustine extended his hand toward me. ""Come on. Don't keep them waiting.""

His intent was obvious—to give me an easy way down and to show the world our marriage was still unshaken.

We unveiled the piece together and delivered our speeches—every move was flawless, every word in perfect harmony.

The soft golden lights traced the angles of his face, so familiar yet so distant.

The warm stage lights traced the mature lines of his profile, and for a moment, I was transported back eight years, to when we had first taken over a smuggling route together.

That night, after securing our first million-dollar deal, he had slipped this very ring onto my finger aboard a yacht.

I smiled and whispered, ""Mr. Clayton, what a wild ride through blood and flames.""

But the human heart, I realized, was far more unpredictable than any gamble in Las Vegas.

Chapter 4

I excused myself from the crowd, claiming I needed some air, and stepped out onto the terrace.

Cecilia followed me out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

""Ms. Lambert,"" she called, voice dripping with challenge.

I turned, regarding her with cool detachment.

""Four years ago, the night you had your miscarriage, Augustine told you he was away on business,"" she spat, aiming to twist the knife. ""He was actually in my bed.""

I took a slow drag of my cigarette, exhaled, and met her gaze, calm as ever.

""I thought you'd have learned some tact by now,"" I said quietly.

Her eyes flashed. ""He loves me. He said he'd divorce you and marry me. He promised I'd have everything.""

I laughed. The sound came out low, amused, and almost pitying.

""He said that in bed, didn't he? That's his favorite place to make promises.""

I flicked ash off my cigarette. ""Every woman who's come to me has said the same thing. Tell me, what makes you any different?""

I stubbed out the cigarette and turned to leave.

But as I brushed past, she suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""The first time I stepped into his house, I knew you were just lucky,"" she spat. ""You and I came from the same dirt. Why you? Why did you get to be his wife?

""I'm younger. I'm prettier. I should've been the one!""

Her voice shook with anger and envy. ""Please, just divorce him! Let him go!""

I frowned and started to pull away. But suddenly, a deafening crash exploded from below.

The floor shuddered violently, and the terrace rail groaned and began to split.

By the time Augustine and his men rushed in, the terrace had cracked in two. Cecilia and I were stranded on opposite sides, the structure crumbling beneath us.

""Mr. Clayton, the structure won't hold!"" one of his men shouted. ""You've gotta save one first!""

A second collapse could hit any second; whoever got left behind was as good as dead.

Cecilia screamed, sobbing hysterically. My knuckles were white against the ledge.

""Augustine!"" I cried. ""The night I lost our baby—you swore you'd never hurt me again!""

It was all I had left to bargain with. Even if love was gone, maybe his guilt wasn't.

Augustine's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darting in tortured hesitation.

Then Cecilia shrieked, ""Augustine! I'm pregnant with your child!""

His eyes widened. And in that instant, I knew.

""Save Cecilia first!"" he shouted.

I watched as they pulled her to safety, her tears shining in the chaos.

Then the stone beneath my hands gave way.

Weightlessness hit me like a punch—I plummeted downward, eyes squeezing shut in resignation.

I got it. Cecilia had his child growing inside her; I was just yesterday's flame. How could I compete?

Luck—or irony—saved me.

I crashed into a canopy, which broke my fall.

After a day and night lost to unconsciousness, the rescue team found me.

When I awoke, the media frenzy was in full swing.

The title read, ""Las Vegas Collapse Suspected as Rival Sabotage: Augustine Jets Off to Switzerland with Shaken Lover for Recuperation.""

In the photos, his arm was wrapped protectively around her waist. Their departure date was the same day I was wheeled into surgery.

It was just like when I lost our baby. I'd lain alone in that hospital bed too—abandoned, forgotten.

While Augustine was away, I recovered in silence, enjoying the rare peace.

His deputy kept sending over lavish gifts: orchids air-shipped from France and exquisite jewels that screamed opulence.

I threw every single one out.

When I was finally discharged, I went to my old house in North Las Vegas.

There, I burned everything Augustine had ever given me.

As I walked out of the alley, a black military jeep was parked at the corner.

Augustine stood beside it, watching me.

""Cecilia's pregnant,"" he said quietly.

Chapter 5

Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.

I didn't flinch.

""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.

""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.

""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""

It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.

""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.

""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""

I didn't break stride, my heels clicking defiantly against the pavement.

That night, I took another car back to our villa in Summerlin.

The first thing I did was check my accounts. Several tens of millions of dollars sat quietly in them. A fortune by ordinary standards, but compared to Augustine's arms empire, it was barely a ripple.

They say when a man gains wealth, he loses his morals. And when a woman loses her morals, she gains wealth.

If I were truly heartless, I could've stayed—lived on as Mrs. Clayton in name and enjoyed the money, the diamonds, and the power.

But I was done living a lie. I didn't want to rot away in this gilded cage any longer.

That night, I bought a one-way ticket to Dubai.

I'd leave the moment the divorce papers were finalized.

Three days later, I arrived at the Clayton mansion for the meeting. The air inside was heavy with tension.

The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.

Shelly's tone was firm. ""The child cannot stay. The heir of our family will not be born from a disgrace.""

Augustine tapped his fingers on the table, his voice low but steady. ""Once the baby is born, I'll announce to the public that it's Kassandra's. She can't have kids of her own—this fixes everything perfectly.""

""No,"" Shelly cut him off sharply.

I set down my teacup and said quietly, ""The night I miscarried, you swore you'd never have a child with another woman for as long as you lived.""

Augustine's reply came low and gravelly, laced with weary resignation. ""Kassandra, we can't keep chaining ourselves to old vows forever.""

Before I could respond, a car horn blared outside—the courier had arrived.

I went out to sign for the delivery.

Inside the envelope were two divorce certificates.

I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.

As I turned my head, I saw Cecilia standing there, eyes burning with hatred.

""Kassandra, I hate you! Why do they all protect you?"" She screamed, her voice shrill and shaking.

I ignored her and moved to pass, but she grabbed my wrist with surprising strength.

""I'll make sure he never looks at you again!"" She shouted, and before I could react, she snatched a fruit knife from the table and plunged it into her own abdomen.

Augustine and others came running at the sound. When they arrived, Cecilia was curled on the floor, blood soaking through her dress.

""Augustine... She tried to kill me... She wanted to kill our baby...""

She gasped, her voice weak but clear enough to condemn me.

""Kassandra!"" Augustine roared. He scooped Cecilia into his arms, his eyes blazing with fury.

I stood there, unmoved. ""If the baby's gone, she has no one to blame but herself.""

The next second, his hand struck my face.

The sharp crack echoed through the hall.

""You evil bitch,"" he hissed, his voice colder than steel. ""We'll settle this when I get back.""

With that, he carried Cecilia out. I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and watched their car disappear into the distance.

Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.

Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.

A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""

I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.

""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.

""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""

Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.

I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.

At the airport, I paused for a moment, watching the planes lift and vanish into the burning Nevada sky. Then I dialed the number Felicia had sent me.

A low, confident voice answered, warm with amusement. ""Long time no see, Sandra. When you land in Dubai, I'll be there to pick you up.""

""Alright,"" I replied softly.

I closed my eyes for a second, clutching my one-way ticket out of Las Vegas.

In my heart, I whispered, ""Augustine, we've tangled for eight long years.

Chapter 1

After the divorce, I left Las Vegas without a moment's hesitation.

I headed to Dubai alone, ready to start anew.

Over time, I carved out a name for myself in the shadowy world of Middle Eastern arms dealing.

Then, whispers from Las Vegas reached me: my ex-husband, Augustine Clayton, was about to get engaged to his little mistress.

I ran my fingers over the bullet pendant around my neck.

Eight years ago, during a brutal gang shootout, he'd taken that bullet for me. It had grazed perilously close to his heart, missing by a hair's breadth.

Once the surgeons pulled it out, he fashioned it into a necklace and slipped it around my neck.

His voice was soft, almost tender, as he whispered, ""From now on, my life is yours.""

Snapping back to the present, I yanked the chain off without a second thought and tossed it into the trash.

Back then, everyone sneered that I was just some prize Augustine had won at the casino tables—that without him, I'd be nothing.

Seven years later, I returned to Las Vegas to open a new mine.

At the negotiation table, Augustine, who ruled half the city, locked eyes with me, and in that instant, tears welled up in his eyes.

I, however, remembered what had happened at his father's funeral seven years earlier.

That day, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his mistress, letting her play the part of his wife, graciously accepting condolences from family and friends.

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.

I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.

""Sign them.""

Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.

Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.

""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.

""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""

Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.

""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""

I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.

All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.

I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.

After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.

""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""

I nudged the divorce papers forward again.

Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""

Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.

He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""

I didn't look away until his figure faded.

Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.

His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.

And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.

Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.

When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.

""Kassandra,"" he called out.

My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.

""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""

I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.

""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.

""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""

Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.

I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.

His face darkened in an instant.

""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.

""Augustine!""

His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.

""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""

""Get the hell off me!""

Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.

Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.

Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.

I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.

In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.

""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.

I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.

Chapter 2

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.

He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.

I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.

Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.

I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.

There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.

The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.

""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""

Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.

""Looks like you still don't get it.

""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""

I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.

Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.

""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""

I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.

""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.

""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""

I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.

For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.

By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.

Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.

""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""

His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.

I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""

His eyes blazed with arctic rage.

""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""

It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.

""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.

Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.

In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.

Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.

Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.

I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.

Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.

But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.

I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.

During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.

On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.

After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.

""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.

She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.

""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.

""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.

""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""

The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.

In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.

""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""

It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.

These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.

I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.

""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.

I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""

Chapter 3

When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.

I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.

A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.

Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.

She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""

I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.

Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.

My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.

As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.

""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.

""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.

She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""

""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""

I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""

Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""

That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.

I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.

Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""

My hand froze midair.

I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.

Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""

I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.

""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""

I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.

""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.

""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""

The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.

Augustine showed up with Cecilia on his arm, stealing the spotlight the moment they walked in.

When I entered the hall, I overheard him introducing Cecilia to the investors as his woman.

Someone spotted me and greeted, ""Mrs. Clayton!""

""Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clayton,"" Cecilia mocked, her tone sugary and cruel. ""That dress looks a little... modest for the occasion, doesn't it?""

I lifted my hand slightly, revealing the emerald ring that symbolized my status as Augustine's wife. ""What I wear doesn't matter,"" I said coolly. ""What matters is that everyone here knows exactly who Mrs. Clayton is.

""Men like to have their fun sometimes. Ms. Webster, not everyone has your... devotion—content to be a mistress for life.""

Onstage, the host invited Augustine and his wife to unveil the centerpiece.

Augustine extended his hand toward me. ""Come on. Don't keep them waiting.""

His intent was obvious—to give me an easy way down and to show the world our marriage was still unshaken.

We unveiled the piece together and delivered our speeches—every move was flawless, every word in perfect harmony.

The soft golden lights traced the angles of his face, so familiar yet so distant.

The warm stage lights traced the mature lines of his profile, and for a moment, I was transported back eight years, to when we had first taken over a smuggling route together.

That night, after securing our first million-dollar deal, he had slipped this very ring onto my finger aboard a yacht.

I smiled and whispered, ""Mr. Clayton, what a wild ride through blood and flames.""

But the human heart, I realized, was far more unpredictable than any gamble in Las Vegas.

Chapter 4

I excused myself from the crowd, claiming I needed some air, and stepped out onto the terrace.

Cecilia followed me out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

""Ms. Lambert,"" she called, voice dripping with challenge.

I turned, regarding her with cool detachment.

""Four years ago, the night you had your miscarriage, Augustine told you he was away on business,"" she spat, aiming to twist the knife. ""He was actually in my bed.""

I took a slow drag of my cigarette, exhaled, and met her gaze, calm as ever.

""I thought you'd have learned some tact by now,"" I said quietly.

Her eyes flashed. ""He loves me. He said he'd divorce you and marry me. He promised I'd have everything.""

I laughed. The sound came out low, amused, and almost pitying.

""He said that in bed, didn't he? That's his favorite place to make promises.""

I flicked ash off my cigarette. ""Every woman who's come to me has said the same thing. Tell me, what makes you any different?""

I stubbed out the cigarette and turned to leave.

But as I brushed past, she suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""The first time I stepped into his house, I knew you were just lucky,"" she spat. ""You and I came from the same dirt. Why you? Why did you get to be his wife?

""I'm younger. I'm prettier. I should've been the one!""

Her voice shook with anger and envy. ""Please, just divorce him! Let him go!""

I frowned and started to pull away. But suddenly, a deafening crash exploded from below.

The floor shuddered violently, and the terrace rail groaned and began to split.

By the time Augustine and his men rushed in, the terrace had cracked in two. Cecilia and I were stranded on opposite sides, the structure crumbling beneath us.

""Mr. Clayton, the structure won't hold!"" one of his men shouted. ""You've gotta save one first!""

A second collapse could hit any second; whoever got left behind was as good as dead.

Cecilia screamed, sobbing hysterically. My knuckles were white against the ledge.

""Augustine!"" I cried. ""The night I lost our baby—you swore you'd never hurt me again!""

It was all I had left to bargain with. Even if love was gone, maybe his guilt wasn't.

Augustine's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darting in tortured hesitation.

Then Cecilia shrieked, ""Augustine! I'm pregnant with your child!""

His eyes widened. And in that instant, I knew.

""Save Cecilia first!"" he shouted.

I watched as they pulled her to safety, her tears shining in the chaos.

Then the stone beneath my hands gave way.

Weightlessness hit me like a punch—I plummeted downward, eyes squeezing shut in resignation.

I got it. Cecilia had his child growing inside her; I was just yesterday's flame. How could I compete?

Luck—or irony—saved me.

I crashed into a canopy, which broke my fall.

After a day and night lost to unconsciousness, the rescue team found me.

When I awoke, the media frenzy was in full swing.

The title read, ""Las Vegas Collapse Suspected as Rival Sabotage: Augustine Jets Off to Switzerland with Shaken Lover for Recuperation.""

In the photos, his arm was wrapped protectively around her waist. Their departure date was the same day I was wheeled into surgery.

It was just like when I lost our baby. I'd lain alone in that hospital bed too—abandoned, forgotten.

Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.

I didn't flinch.

""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.

""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.

""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""

It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.

""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.

""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""

The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.

I went out to sign for the delivery.

I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.

Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.

Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.

A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""

I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.

""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.

""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""

Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.

I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.

""Alright,"" I replied softly.

Host Kelly O’Donnell asked, “\[A\] final lightning round question, what timeline do you think for a reduction in prices on those goods from coffee, to bananas, to tomatoes? Is this a few weeks, a few months?”

Rollins answered, “It should be very quick, within, I’d say, a few weeks, to a few months.

Things were mostly good at the start but prior to me asking her out there was few red flags where instances she tried to make me jealous in front of other guys and also her displaying a short temper. This short temper and her reactions being disproportionate to the situation increased the months after we became official and became somewhat unbearable that I decided to breakup. She then said she would change and go to therapy and did a few sessions. I found myself sucked back in and we went back to dating over the course of last summer. This time I did notice a shift where she would be more communicative and more controlling of her temper and her mood shifted less. I guess I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells anymore. However I was concerned when she told me that she had stopped seeing her therapist after 5 sessions. I then started wonder did she really want genuine change. Then the last few months she became a little bit more clingy than usual (which is fine) but more so to a controlling point. I would be accused of cheating for going to the gym with a friend or she would begin crying if I met a friend for coffee. I felt this linked more to control. This eventually spiralled a bit into her one night ringing my phone over 10 times when I said the electrician was coming to my house. I gave her the time I’d be done and said I would pick her up but she began walking towards my house and said she had been attacked after I rang her back following 10 missed calls and 15 texts. The texts were things like “ do you care” , “are you cheating”. I comforted her after and things went back to normal the next day but I wasn’t gonna question the validity of her story. A few days later I ended the relationship as It didn’t feel right anymore and I didn’t feel like I could live a normal life and be worried about making someone else upset when I’m doing basic activities and also it’s not good for.

We have been broken up a month and she has tried to break no contact twice in the first two weeks. These were “accidental texts” or sending something to friends. Anytime she tried to open dialogue then I would end it with a reaction to her message or “ sorry to hear that, hope things get better”. However three days ago she began asking how I was. Out of politeness I responded but she followed it up with saying how bad things were for her. She then proceeded to call me a few times (which I didn’t answer). She then sent voice notes however I only listened to two and didn’t respond and she then deleted them and said never mind I was just having a moment . She stated in the two voice notes I heard that she was confused by the breakup and wanted to know for sure why I broke up and that she didn’t know if I was taking a breakup to work on myself or move forward in life with other people aswell as if we can be friends in future. I was confused by this because I felt it made clear the relationship was no longer working hence me wanting to end it. It really just sounded like her refusing to accept it’s over and maybe build dialogue. This doesn’t do my healing any good and I feel it affects the healing process and that she is not being respectful of boundaries. Now I also feel obliged to tell her again why I don’t want to continue with the relationship which is annoying because it’s awful thing to do with another human…",1,1763554406.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I have, as most people who try meditation and give up, tried meditating a few years back and I never understood nor felt many positive effects, besides one time, which I oddly remember, whilst reading a book about listening where I had felt a moment of pure present, I was not thinking, I was here. I still remember the bliss and vibration I had felt which might be why it has still stuck with me to this day even though I had not realised the profoudness of that stillness at that moment. I am writing to ask a few questions because around 3 months ago I moved to a different city, I stopped smoking weed, I don't have a computer (I used to play a lot of games, watch videos, listen to music, watch pornography, etc. for extended periods of time around 6-10 hours of brain activity everyday for the past 4-6 years), I stopped hanging out with people whom always brought me the feeling of not belonging and only communicated based mainly on emotion, whilst also involving me in smoking weed, drinking and certainly other unrewarding activity. And I started meditating, everyday, I began with trataka meditation by staring at a candle, watching the afterimage and of course being aware or my mind. I had also began to notice my ego in every single interaction I had with others, noticing other individuals interactions with ego and most importantly noticing the ego in my own mind at all times. Due to me now living in a dorm with my friend I cannot always meditate in quiet as he is a constant stimuli for my senses, so Instead of only meditating before going to sleep, I began meditating everywhere, being present and aware as much as I can. Around my first month of meditating I had a certain experience I'd like to share: 

Whole day ive been feeling this sort of vibration, static like electricity throughout my body along with slight bliss that came and went. Ive attributed this feeling towards moments of when things sort of ""click"" and i sort of get chills throughout my body and feel joy, ive been attributing this vibration towards these feelings my whole life, an example would be a great piece of music and the chills you get, or something like reading a text and it making so much sense that you feel those chills, that vibration, tingling sensation throughout your body. Today i meditated and focused my attention on it, i realized that i can kinda ""tune"" into it, along it came so much bliss which almost felt overwhelming  because of how powerful it feels it even made me tear up, but it is not a thing that arises alongside emotion, it is like an energy, a vibration you can always feel. In yogic terms this might be prana, what youd call life force that is in all things. I have understood something today and it feels great.


After this experience, I had started to feel that vibration everyday, I feel it specifically everytime I meditate and focus on my breath throughout my whole body, beginning from my back extending to my legs, arms and head, sometimes I feel it only below my neck but when I meditate longer the vibration comes back to my head, sometimes it only activates in certain areas like navel and root chakras without going further. I also feel it at what seem to be random times and at certain times, for example, when I thought about being with and one with Brahman, i felt those vibrations, when I thought to myself of how I want to love myself and all others around me, I felt it. And when I shared with my friends certain wisdom, such as the yogic parts of the mind like chitta, ahamkara, buddhi, manas, when i felt that they were truly listening and I was speaking with such excitment, I felt those vibrations, specifically I noticed them more around my head than body. I wonder if this is just shivers from joy or excitment as i earlier thought or something more. Alongside this feeling I started feeling another thing, for example when i concentrate my attention on my navel, heart or any other chakras i feel some kind of heat, pulsing but my attention has to be really focused and it almost feels like im forcing it and just constraining my blood vessels to give the illusion of something else, I feel slight jitters or shaking when i focus too hard on it aswell.

For a little more context, I am 19, virgin, I don't smoke, I have eaten a certain poisonous mushroom twice and felt profound love for all beings and felt being completely present as if no other moment than right now existed, and just general mushroom goodness and understanding  but no ""heroic dose"" or ego death. I started drinking coffee almost everyday 3 months ago due to me feeling drowsy everyday even though I have always been against caffeine in early stages of life as it can affect brain development and is in general an external source of energy. I have had depression and suicidal thoughts from around the 13-18 years of this life and a general materialistic, rational, atheistic image of life which lead to more confusion yet I always strived for knowledge and a certain part of me for love, I've always felt this strong love coming from within which i wanted to share with somebody but could never really express, I have never gotten into a serious fight as since childhood, even if I was provoked or hit I always avoided contlict as I knew nothing good comes of it, but indirectly doing so I bottled my anger up. Through my teenage years working through depression I started to engage in psychology and philosophy, which helped me seriously understand why and how I acted, this is where i first got acquainted with the self and my environment and how it had programmed me into being who I am from an external source. I also remember my dreams which i have 3-5 per day (If i sleep 7 or more hours), I also lucid dream often ever since the age of 15. Since 15 I have also started to put myself in uncomfortable situations to meet new people, put myself out there so I could become more confident in myself for which the effects were immediate, I also began expressing myself through fashion which allowed me to finally feel like I was someone. Before I was just an introverted ""nobody"" and all those other good ol identities I'd put on myself but with time I started to remove those identities, I never liked putting myself in a box and restricting myself.

When I started meditating I started to notice immediately how my attention was present and my mind stopped fluttering. When i am in the company of my two younger sisters I feel like I am competely present, completely with them and I laugh alongside them at whatever gag tbey are having, this feeling of being in the right now and enjoying without thought, of future and past, feel much like my experience on a certain mushroom. I have been reading on some eastern philosophy and got acquainted with concepts like karma, kundalini, prana, brahman, atman, chakras, etc. And been surprised at myself at how easily i accepted these ideas without much or any thinking at all, as if my whole life I have been prepared to understand them. I am reading the upanishads translated by swami paramananda, autobiography of a yogi and a few others. Specifically I have almost finished the book Enlightenment through the path of kundalini by tara springett and have some questions stemming from them.

My meditation usually involves me sitting in a half lotus or lotus position which I can only sit in for around 40 minutes and then it starts to uncomfortable as my lower body becomes numb, even though I am flexible, so I usually alternate to a corpse position where I meditate while laying down and focus on slow inhale and slower exhale, and stopping breath to be completely still. When I am relaxed I imagine my body to be hollow with golden light inside and focus on my chakras, one by one I try to feel them with my awareness and, admittedly at random i focus on one, like my agna chakra, heart or root not really having a specific motive besides noticing.

As for context goes I believe thats enough and my main reasoning for writing all of this is to ask these questions:


1 - Are these ""vibrations"" I feel my life force, prana, or just something simpler like nerves firing due to excitment?

2 - Is the heat i described more concentrated life force, kundalini, or just something im forcing and is more mechanical?

3 - How do I know which chakra is active? ( I understand it is open from birth I'd like to know whether or not I am ready for kundalini)
 How do I know if it's ""blocked"" when I have no negative emotion?

4 - From the kundalini book I have been reading it mentioned the need to ask your higher self, divine power, a deity for help, guidance and eventually to merge with it. As trying to reach enlightenment independently is practically impossible, I have no guru nor teacher of yoga so I have tried imagining my higher self as golden energy in the shape of an angel channeling its chakra to the chakra I focus on and hugging me and sometimes others for pure love. But is this visualization good or needed to further my spirituality?

5 - Is fasting a good idea for helping activate the chakras, to stimulate prana and how should one approach it?

6 - I've heard alcohol is counterproductive towards the path of kundalini, how about other stimulants such as caffeine? I have heard of techniques which can provide energy for the day, would they help with drowsiness?

7 - What about celibacy, I've heard from different people different answers, ancient yogis believed that to become enlightened you must not release your seed. More modern takes are that you can masturbate or procreate (having sex with the intent to love is even better) but not as an addiction or escape from emotions. 

8 - There are in total 112 meditation techniques which all lead to the same goal, is practicing only one or two enough, should you find the best one suited for you and keep on it? How can you know which practice is best suited for you?

9 - Also kind of a bonus question I just thought of but what about jewelry? I see some buddhists, hindus wearing prayer beads or similar alumets but what about detachment towards it? and does it help with energy work, like copper jewelry?

Hey guys I recently bought a Meraki and whilst the machine has worked great on some occasions it keeps having some hiccups with the grinder plus I think the grinder needs recalibrating and I don't want to have to do this after spending the amount I did. Alas she is being returned.

  
I've decided to take some advice I received after buying and change my setup to a separate grinder next to a dedicated machine that doesn't bother integrating a cheaper grinder. MY machine before the Meraki was a Breville and the grinder really struggled. 

  
My budget is still 2000 total and a recommend on both machines would be appreciated but ideally i would love a recommend on a grinder.

  
I'm keen to know if owners of the DF64 or niche Zero have had much success with a medium/lighter roast as this is what has shown the problems for me with both the integrated grinders I have used.

As of November 14, a White House announcement excluded several agricultural products from the reciprocal tariff regime, specifically those not produced in the US. Coffee made the cut, obviously, since the US still imports more than 99% of what it consumes.

The price of ground roast coffee in the US had gone up sharply this year. It hit about $9.14 in September, roughly a 40 percent jump over the previous year. Wholesalers initially absorbed the shock, but eventually passed it through. Retail prices averaged about $3.5 nationwide by August 2025.

[Ground Roast Coffee Prices in the US](https://preview.redd.it/0ckbpid5f72g1.png?width=2648&format=png&auto=webp&s=329de868774160243833840e257937286be6a6d3)

The US imports around 30 percent of its coffee from Brazil, which is its largest supplier, so the tariff had the biggest inflationary impact there. The duty jumped from 10 percent to 50 percent, driven largely by political tensions between the two countries, with the Trump administration expressing unhappiness over the trial of former Brazilian President Bolsonaro.

On top of tariffs, weather issues across major coffee-producing regions have squeezed global inventory. Droughts, wildfires, and typhoons have hit Brazil, Vietnam, Uganda, and Ivory Coast. Futures prices have reacted too: they were trading around $120 in mid-2020 and have crossed $400 this month.

You can even see the impact on Starbucks, whose stock is down nearly 20 percent since February 2025.

But with coffee now exempted from reciprocal tariffs under the latest White House order, hopefully all of us coffee lovers can stop waking up every morning and smelling the higher prices.",1,1763553937.0,TheDock,0,1.0,False

My fists clench at my sides, nails biting into my palms as I stare, frozen, at the scene before me.

The room reeks of sweat and sex, I can’t help but tremble.

And there he is.

Dmitri.

My fiancé.

The man I was supposed to marry.

Groveling at my feet, tangled in his own damn pants as he fumbles to cover himself. His face is pale, his hair disheveled, his lips—those same lips that whispered loving words into my ears—swollen from kissing someone else.

A woman—a stranger—lays half-naked on the bed behind him, the silk sheets tangled around her body as she scrambles away like a cornered animal. Her eyes dart to mine in wide-eyed panic before she clutches the blanket to her chest and bolts toward the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

Coward.

Dmitri stares up at me, panic laced in his voice. ""Elena—it's not what it looks like.""

A hollow laugh escapes me. Cold. Emotionless. Clearly the laugh of a woman who has lost everything.

I take a step closer, my heels clicking against the polished hardwood floor. I feel detached from my own body, as if I'm watching this play out from somewhere far, far away.

""Not what it looks like?"" I repeat softly, tilting my head.

Dmitri, the man who once promised me forever, dares to feed me that cliché excuse.

A lump lodges in my throat, burning like acid.

""Dmitri,"" my voice is eerily calm, my hands trembling with suppressed rage, ""I just buried my father.""

His eyes flicker with guilt, but his lips part uselessly, searching for words.

""I came here because I—I needed you."" My voice cracks, raw with heartbreak. ""And I find you like this?""

I gesture to the bed—our bed—where another woman had just lain underneath him. The sheets I had picked out. The mattress we had chosen together. The room that was supposed to be ours.

Dmitri pushes to his feet, his pants still unbuttoned, his entire existence suddenly repulsive. He reaches for me. ""Please, I—""

""Don't touch me.""

My voice is sharper than I intend, but the thought of his hands on me now makes my skin crawl.

His face twists, desperation seeping into his features. ""It was a mistake! I wasn’t thinking—""

I scoff, my arms folding tightly over my chest. ""Oh? Your dick just happened to slip into her?""

Dmitri flinches. ""Elena—""

""Shut up.""

My breath is ragged. My vision blurs, but I refuse to cry. I refuse to break down in front of him.

I should be screaming. I should be throwing things, clawing at him, making him bleed the way he's just made me bleed. But I can't. I'm too numb.

Too shattered.

A part of me—a stupid, naive, pathetic part—wants him to fight for me.

To drop to his knees. To beg. To convince me that this isn’t real, that this is just some nightmare I’ll wake up from.

But I don't wake up.

I just stand there, breathing in the reality of it all.

""You said you loved me.""

Dmitri swallows hard. ""I do.""

My laugh is bitter. ""You have a funny way of showing it.""

Silence.

Maybe if this was the past me. Even the ‘me’ from yesterday, I would have screamed. I would have cursed him out. But now? I was already exhausted. Half my world had already shattered this morning.

So, instead, I inhale sharply and turn on my heel, my heart pounding against my ribs.

I need to leave.

Now.

""Elena, wait!"" Dmitri grabs my wrist, his grip desperate, but I rip myself free with such force that he stumbles back.

The love I had for him dies in that moment.

I don’t even look back as I walk away. Leaving our apartment. I walk in a daze, my mind completely lost to mourning my step-father, mourning the marriage life that I knew wouldn’t happen anymore.

My parent’s house is dark when I step inside.

The funeral was in the morning. It felt like a lifetime ago. And now, it’s night.

Everything feels different. Colder. Like the walls know what I’ve seen tonight, know that I am no longer the same woman who left this house earlier.

I swallow the lump in my throat and walk deeper inside, my heels clicking against the wooden floor.

""Mom?"" I call softly.

She must be sleeping. I had left her resting in her bedroom when I went to see Dmitri. God, I wish I hadn’t gone.

I wipe at my eyes, barely aware of the way my body shakes. The exhaustion crashes into me like a freight train.

One step. Then another.

I reach the kitchen, my fingers gripping the doorframe, ready to head upstairs—

Then I see her.

A choked gasp rips from my throat.

My mother.

She’s on the floor.

""Mom?"" My voice trembles.

She doesn’t move.

The room spins. My breath catches. No. No, no, no.

I stumble forward, collapsing onto my knees beside her. My hands shake violently as I reach for her, pressing my fingers to her neck, checking for breath, for warmth, for anything—

She’s burning.

Her skin is clammy, her forehead damp. And there—little red splotches marring her arm.

Burns.

What happened?

""Mom!"" I shake her. Hard. ""Mom, wake up! Please!""

She doesn’t stir.

The air leaves my lungs.

No. No. NO.

Please, God. Not her. Not her too.

My pulse roars in my ears, drowning everything else out as I grab my phone, my fingers fumbling, my vision blurring.

My heart slams against my ribs.

My throat tightens.

Tears blind me.

But there’s no time to panic.

I dial.

The ringing feels endless.

Then—

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I swallow a sob.

""My mother—she’s unconscious. Please. Please hurry.""

The operator starts talking, but I can barely hear.

I press my forehead to my mother’s, my body trembling.

“Stay with me,” I whisper. “Please, Mom. Stay with me.”

# Chapter 2

Elena’s POV:

The sterile white halls of the emergency ward felt like they were closing in on me, the scent of antiseptic and fear thick in the air.

My mother was wheeled in on a gurney, nurses shouting to each other in rushed, clipped voices as the emergency room doors swung open, then slammed shut, sealing her away from me.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my pulse a frantic drum against my ribs.

What do I do? What do I do?

My hands trembled as I pressed them to my face, trying to steady my breath, but it was impossible. She was fine this morning. Weak, but alive. And now she was in there, fighting for her life.

A nurse approached, her expression gentle. ""Miss Kovalyova?""

I turned, my throat too tight to respond.

""The doctor will speak with you shortly.""

I nodded numbly, my nails digging into my palms.

Minutes stretched into eternity. I had no idea how long I stood there, my body tense and aching.

Then the doors swung open again, and a doctor stepped out, his face strained.

I rushed forward. “Is she okay?”

The doctor exhaled. ""Your mother suffered a severe cardiac episode due to prolonged stress and underlying conditions. We need to perform an emergency bypass surgery to prevent further damage.""

My breath caught. ""Okay,"" I said, too quickly. ""Then do it.""

His face hardened. ""The procedure costs fifty eight thousand dollars here.""

The number hit me like a punch to the gut.

A sharp ringing filled my ears as my mind tried to process it. Fifty thousand dollars?!

I didn't have that kind of money.

Hell, I barely had enough to cover next month’s rent. We were already in deep shit with our previous debt.

""You'll need to secure the payment within the next twenty-four hours so we can proceed,"" the doctor continued, oblivious to the way my world was crumbling beneath my feet.

""Twenty-four hours?"" My voice came out hollow.

""Yes. If we delay any longer, her condition may worsen beyond what surgery can fix.""

I stared at him. Twenty-four hours. Fifty eight thousand dollars.

""Do you have insurance?"" the doctor asked, his voice impassive, like this was just another conversation for him.

""No."" My voice broke on the word.

""Family who can assist?""

I wanted to laugh. What family?

He sighed, pushing his glasses up his nose. ""I suggest you find a solution quickly. We will keep her stable for now, but time is of the essence."" With that, he nodded and disappeared down the hallway, leaving me standing in the wreckage of my life.

I stumbled backward onto one of the plastic chairs in the waiting area, my vision swimming.

I was alone.

There was no one I could call, no one I could ask.

And for one horrifying second, my mind drifted to Dmitri.

Dmitri Vetrov. My ex-fiancé.

Rich. Powerful. The youngest son of a multimillionaire. He could write a check for fifty thousand dollars without blinking.

Would he help me?

My stomach curled in disgust at the thought.

I could see it now. His smug, self-satisfied smirk. The condescending tilt of his head as he crossed his arms and leaned back, acting as if I owed him something for his generosity after how I had left him begging on his knees just a while ago.

No.

If my mother found out I had lowered myself to begging my cheating ex for money, she wouldn’t accept it. She would rather die than have me throw away my dignity for her.

And I wasn’t sure I could survive begging Dmitri either.

Then who?

My nails dug into my knees, my breath coming in short gasps. What do I do? What do I do?

And then—

A familiar name echoed from a nearby television.

I lifted my head.

The hospital’s mounted TV was tuned into a business channel, the news anchor’s voice crisp and professional.

“—Vetrov Enterprises, owned by billionaire Nikolai Vetrov, announced a record-breaking deal today—”

Nikolai Vetrov.

The camera shifted to a man in his mid-thirties, dressed in a sharp black suit, his jawline like it was carved from stone. His dark brown hair gelled back to perfection.

His cold, calculating dark eyes scanned the reporters, his smile hiding something dangerous.

The most eligible bachelor in the whole of Alderidge.

Nikolai Vetrov.

Dmitri’s older stepbrother.

And the man who hated Dmitri with every fiber of his being.

The memory surfaced before I could stop it.

Dmitri’s twenty-fifth birthday. Six months ago.

A lavish party was held in a massive ballroom, filled with people who definitely didn’t belong in my world. I was from a lower class family, attending college with a scholarship.

However, I had become Dmitri’s girlfriend and after four years, for the first time he had invited me to such an occasion. Introducing me to others like I was a trophy. I had actually been extremely happy that day.

Because that was also the day Dmitri had proposed to me.

I had just left the restroom, smoothing out my dress, when I nearly collided with Nikolai Vetrov.

He had been leaning against the hallway wall, one hand in his pocket, a cigarette between his fingers. His onyx brown eyes swept over me, slow and deliberate.

Then he exhaled, releasing a cloud of smoke. ""My condolences.""

I frowned. ""Excuse me?""

""Your mind is sharp,"" he murmured, voice low, slightly slurred from alcohol. ""But your taste in men is absolutely tragic.""

I had been dumbfounded.

Like, who says that about their own brother?

It was the first time I truly realized Nikolai didn’t just dislike Dmitri like a lot of siblings do. He despised him.

""You have such a smart little mind,"" he mused, ""but it’s wasted on a man like him.""

I scoffed. ""And what makes you say that?""

Nikolai took another drag from his cigarette, exhaling slowly as he looked out into the city through the massive floor to ceiling windows in front of us.

""He isn’t exactly husband material.""

I let out a sharp laugh. ""Oh? And what do you think makes a man husband material?"" It had truly been funny to me, that a ‘man’ was telling me what ‘husband material’ was supposed to be.

But I didn’t defend Dmitri, I noticed the venom in Nikolai’s tone and knew it would be useless. I didn’t want to pick a fight with someone like him either.

His gaze darkened, piercing straight into my soul.

""He sucks at cooking.""

My brows lifted. ""Seriously?""

""You laugh, but a man who can’t even take care of himself can’t take care of you either.""

I rolled my eyes. ""It’s fine. I can cook and I’m used to taking care of myself.""

Nikolai’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk.

""He’s shit with money. Spends it like water.""

""He’s rich. Why does it matter?""

His gaze sharpened. ""Are you marrying him for money, then?""

I met his stare and tilted my head. ""What if I am?"" Of course I wasn’t. I hadn’t taken a dime from Dmitri. Not that I was against being treated like a princess. I was just not used to being indebted to anyone like this, it made my skin itch.

However, instead of getting offended, Nikolai looked… satisfied. He straightened, flicking ash from his cigarette.

""Good,"" he said.

I frowned. That’s it?

He studied me for a long moment, then murmured, ""I’m richer than him, you know.""

I blinked.

""What does that have to do with me?""

Nikolai shrugged. Then he walked away.

Only later on had I realized what he meant when he had said the last line, but I had tossed it to the back of my mind and assumed he was testing me for his little brother.

That memory burned in my mind as I stared at his face on the TV screen.

Nikolai Vetrov was richer than Dmitri.

More powerful. More ruthless. And he hated his stepbrother.

I sucked in a sharp breath.

An idea began to take shape—insane, desperate, but my only option.

I needed money.

I wanted power.

And there was a man who had both.

I needed Nikolai Vetrov.

# Chapter 3

Elena’s POV:

If I was wrong about Nikolai Vetrov’s intentions, the worst that could happen was that I would embarrass myself. That was nothing compared to what was at stake. But if I didn’t do anything—if I didn’t at least try to ask for his help—and my mother’s condition worsened, or worse…

I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life.

I exhaled sharply, forcing my shaky legs to push me upright.

That’s it then.

I had made my choice.

Pulling out my phone, I searched for the address of Vetrov Enterprises. I had been there once or twice before, back when Dmitri would take me out for lunch at one of the high-end restaurants near his brother’s office. But I didn’t remember the exact address.

At least I knew Nikolai wasn’t out of the country.

I glanced down at my outfit—a simple black dress, the same one I had worn earlier at my dad’s funeral. My hair was still tied into a low bun, strands falling loose from hours of exhaustion.

I looked like a grieving woman.

Which, in many ways, I was.

I was mourning the death of my father, the life I thought I would have, the man I thought loved me and the security I had believed in.

Now, I had nothing.

Except for this one insane, desperate plan.

— 30 minutes later —

The towering glass building of Vetrov Enterprises loomed before me, its sharp edges piercing the dawn sky.

The city was still asleep, the streets nearly deserted, but this place—this empire Nikolai built with his own hands—was already awake at four o'clock in the morning.

A few luxury cars lined the private parking area, their sleek exteriors gleaming under the streetlights.

I inhaled deeply, steeling myself.

I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to see him right away. CEOs don’t stroll into work at four in the morning. But I had no choice. I would leave my number with the receptionist and pray that Nikolai would agree to meet me.

There was no way I could ask Dmitri for his brother’s number.

Not when I was about to do this.

I pushed through the heavy glass doors and stepped into the lobby.

The receptionist at the front desk—a well-dressed woman in her late twenties— looked up from her computer screen, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me.

“Are you Miss Elena?”

I frowned. “You know me?”

She hesitated, then nodded. “Ah, yes. Sir told me to send you up.”

My heart stopped.

What?

I stared at her, my pulse hammering in my ears. Had he… anticipated my arrival?

No. That wasn’t possible.

How would he know?

My hands curled into fists, my heartbeat racing.

The receptionist smiled and handed me a key card. “Take the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor. He’s expecting you.”

I nodded slowly, forcing myself to act normal as I took the card and walked toward the elevator.

My mind was spiraling.

Was this just a coincidence? Had he expected me to come?

Or… had he known all along that this day would come? No…that didn’t make sense. How would he know that I needed money for my mother’s bypass in advance?

There was another more plausible reason that swirled in my mind…was he somehow stalking me?

I swallowed hard, shaking off the thought as I stepped into the empty elevator.

That was ridiculous though. Why would someone like him have a need to do that?

The moment the doors slid shut, I let out a shaky breath and pressed my back against the cold metal wall.

Calm down. Keep it together.

I tapped the key card against the panel. The elevator hummed to life, carrying me higher and higher.

Maybe it was just my imagination or nervousness but the air felt thinner the closer I got.

Twenty-fifth floor.

Twenty-sixth.

Twenty-seventh.

A soft chime echoed, and the doors glided open.

There was only one office here.

A massive, double-door entrance at the end of the dimly lit hallway.

And sitting just outside it, a man—his posture straight as he typed away at his laptop. Nikolai’s secretary?

As soon as he saw me, he stood up and gestured toward the doors.

“Sir is waiting for you, Miss Kovalyova.” He smiled and moved to open the door for me.

I nodded, thanking him as I stepped inside, my gaze immediately landing on the man behind the desk.

Nikolai Vetrov sat in his massive leather chair, flipping through a file as if he hadn’t just called me here before I even made the decision to come.

His dark eyes flicked up from his papers, locking onto me.

The man was unfairly attractive.

He looked unbothered, composed. His expensive suit was perfectly fitted, the top button of his shirt undone, revealing a glimpse of tattoos peeking from his collar.

The picture-perfect CEO.

And I was standing frozen in front of him.

“Good morning,” he said smoothly, his voice deep.

The last time we had talked, I had drank alcohol so it hadn’t felt like this, and before that, the couple of times we ran into each other we hadn’t conversed at all.

I took a breath, forcing down my nerves. “Morning.”

“Have a seat.”

I did, trying to keep my posture straight and confident despite the storm raging inside me.

“Tea or coffee?” he asked.

“Neither. I’m fine.”

Nikolai frowned slightly before picking up the telecom. “Send in a pumpkin spice latte.”

My body went rigid.

How… did he know my favorite drink?

He leaned back, watching me with something close to amusement. ""Don't think too much. Dmitri talks a lot about you.""

My stomach tightened.

Hearing my ex-fiancé’s name out loud felt like a punch to the ribs. But I refused to show it.

Instead, I kept my gaze trained on Nikolai. “You know what he did, don’t you?”

He smirked.

""I warned you, didn't I? He isn't husband material.""

I clenched my fists ignoring his remark for now. “Why do you hate Dmitri?”

His smirk didn’t fade. ""Hate? No, I don't hate him. But I dislike him.""

I narrowed my eyes.

""He's spoiled. Daddy’s little treasure. He’s never suffered a day in his life. Never had to fight for anything. He thinks with his head, but not the one on his shoulders.""

Nikolai motioned toward his crotch.

I bit down on my tongue, feeling the urge to refute him.

But could I?

I had seen it with my own two eyes.

Dmitri was exactly what Nikolai described.

""After all,"" Nikolai continued, ""if he had any brains, he wouldn’t have fumbled someone like you.""

A sharp, hot sensation crawled up my spine.

This was it. This was my opening.

I lifted my chin. ""I have an offer for you.""

His eyes flickered with interest.

""Marry me. Give me enough money to save my mother. In return, I’ll give you a wife on paper. And a way to make your little brother a laughing stock.""

For the first time, Nikolai froze.

I watched as he leaned back, studying me. Then, his lips curled.

""You're pretty straightforward. I expected you to take more time to come around.""

My fingers dug into my lap. “I don’t have time for that. My mother needs emergency Bypass surgery. Are you willing to help me or not?”

I was probably glaring at him now.

A moment of silence stretched between us.

Then—

""If I say no… will you go back and ask Dmitri for money?""

A wry smile spread across my face.

“He isn’t the only member of the Vetrov family I can go to, you know,” I said, my voice laced with something dangerous. “After all, I know Daddy Vetrov has certain tendencies toward girls half his age.”

I was pushing my limits.

But I had a hunch.

A dangerous, reckless hunch.

That Nikolai Vetrov was interested in me.

# Chapter 4

Elena’s POV:

As expected, Nikolai Vetrov went rigid.

His sharp, composed expression didn’t falter, but something in his posture shifted. His dark eyes locked onto mine, piercing, calculating—assessing me.

Then, he stood up. Slowly.

“You really are something, you know that?” His voice was smooth, almost amused, but there was an underlying challenge in his tone.

“Fine then.” He leaned against his desk, arms crossed. “But tell me, Elena—what else are you willing to give? Because making Dmitri a laughingstock? That’s not difficult for me.”

He smirked. “I could do that without marrying you.”

He was right. He truly didn’t need me for that.

But I needed him.

My wedding with Dmitri was set for three months from now. If I didn’t get married, I would be the one people laughed at. My friends, my classmates, the very people who had seen me flaunt my relationship on social media for years.

The image of Dmitri’s betrayal and his pathetic excuses burned in my mind.

My stomach twisted. I wanted him to suffer.

That’s when I realized—this wasn’t just about saving my mother. If I only needed money for that I could just borrow it from him. Not just him, I could go back to the loan sharks and take more money from them.

They wouldn’t decline me, in fact they would only be happy to see me paying back my debts for the rest of my life.

So yes, I wanted to destroy Dmitri.

I wanted to rip him apart from the inside.

Make him feel even a fraction of what I had felt when I walked in on him with someone else.

I inhaled deeply, staring at Nikolai.

If he wasn’t going to marry me, he was useless to me.

“I’ll give you a wife on paper and nothing more,” I said firmly. “I have nothing else to give.”

That was the truth…or so I thought.

Silence stretched between us.

Then Nikolai got up, his movements slow, deliberate.

His eyes narrowed as he approached, his steps measured, predatory. The air between us grew heavy, thick with an intensity I wasn’t prepared for.

I forced my body to stay still, my heart pounding loudly in my chest.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke.

""You want to marry me and have my name, Elena?""

His breath grazed my ear, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

""Then you’ll take everything that comes with it.""

My eyes widened slightly. “What… do you mean?”

He smiled, his fingers gripping the arms of my chair as he turned it to face him completely.

Our noses almost touched. Our breaths almost intertwined.

""Everything,"" he murmured. ""My money. My fame. And even my body.""

My breath hitched.

But I shook my head. No. No, I couldn’t do that.

“I want a strictly contractual marriage. With a time limit,” I said, my voice steady, but my hands clenched into fists.

His lips curled into a smirk. ""And a contract marriage is what you’ll get. No feelings. No strings attached. One year.”

I narrowed my eyes, “I won’t sleep with you.” I truly didn’t trust myself around a man like him. If I actually slept with him, what if I developed feelings? No…not again. Especially not a Vetrov.

His next words however knocked the air right out of my lungs.

""Oh, no, I need you to understand this, Malishka. There will be no sleeping. Only fucking.""

My entire body stiffened.

He leaned closer, his voice smooth, teasing. ""I will fuck you. If you can accept that… then I will make sure Dmitri grovels at your feet. I’ll ensure your mother’s surgery is done by the world’s best surgeon.

He straightened, studying my reaction before he delivered the final blow.

""And I’ll make sure you never have to work a part-time job again. You’ll have all the time in the world to study—to build your dream of making cars.""

My pulse thundered.

He listed everything I needed. Everything I ever wanted.

If my mother fully recovered, she wouldn’t be upset with this decision. I could focus on my studies. Graduate without worrying about money.

And all I had to do… was give myself to a man built like a Greek god?

What other choice did I have? The loan sharks? Dmitri? Any other rich old guy, someone way worse than Nikolai?

It would be stupid to decline.

But my body was frozen.

My mind was racing.

Could I really do this? Could I really sell my body to this man for a year?

I bit my lip, his unwavering stare making my heart pound.

After what felt like forever, I inhaled deeply, forcing my thoughts to clear.

Finally, I met his gaze head-on.

""Fine. I accept your conditions.""

I squared my shoulders. ""But if you go back on your word, Nikolai—I will ruin you.""

I didn’t know how I would do it.

But I would find a way.

I believed in myself.

…At least, in my follicular phase.

Nikolai chuckled, his smirk widening.

""You have my permission to do so.""

Finally, he pulled away, straightening his suit as he glanced at his watch. Then, his gaze flickered back to me.

""Shall we go then?""

I frowned. “Go where?”

“Well, there’s much to be done if we’re getting married today.”

My eyes widened. ""You mean… right now? Today?!""

He smirked. ""You know what they say, malishka. The early bird—”

“I need to go to the hospital,” I cut his nonsense off.

His smirk faded.

I took a deep breath. ""I need to be with my mom. I can’t just leave her like this.""

He sighed, studying me for a long moment.

""Are you going to perform the surgery?""

I blinked. ""What?""

""No?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""Then why do you need to be there?""

I clenched my jaw. ""Because she’s my mother. I’m her only immediate family. I need to be there for her.""

Nikolai rubbed his temple, exhaling sharply. “Fine. We’ll take care of her first. Give me a moment.”

Then, right in front of me, he pulled out his phone, dialed a number, and put it on speaker.

""Prepare the operating room,"" he ordered.

My breath caught.

There was a pause, then a voice responded. ""Sir?""

""I'm sending you a patient. Her name is Beatrix Kovalyova. Make sure you’re prepared to perform a bypass procedure. You are to treat her as a V.I.P patient. Nothing but the best.""

I stared at him, stunned.

The person on the line hesitated, then cleared their throat.

""Understood, sir. May I ask who the patient is to you?""

Nikolai's gaze flickered to me.

Then, smoothly, he said, ""My mother-in-law.""

My breath hitched.

The doctor on the line hesitated—then let out a soft chuckle.

""Congratulations on the marriage, Mr. Vetrov.""

Nikolai smiled. ""Thank you.""

I looked at him, completely dumbfounded.

What.

The.

Hell?

# Chapter 5

Elena’s POV:

Nikolai buttoned his lapel with a smooth, practiced motion and strode toward the door. His movements were always so smooth, always composed, as if the world bent to his command without question.

I hurried to follow him, my heels clicking softly against the marble floor. ""Where are you going?""

He barely glanced at me as he pressed the elevator button. ""You wanted to see your mother, didn’t you?""

I blinked, nodding. ""Yes, but—"" My brows furrowed. ""You’re coming with me? Don’t you have work?""

I cast a glance back at his secretary, who immediately looked away as if pretending not to eavesdrop.

Nikolai smirked as the elevator doors slid open. ""You know,"" he mused, stepping inside and waiting for me to follow, ""there’s something my late mother used to say. Family always comes first.""

I hesitated before stepping in, standing a careful distance from him.

Family.

That word sat uncomfortably in my chest.

Because everyone knew the story of the Vetrov family scandal—how Andrey Vetrov, one of the richest men in Alderidge, had cheated on his wife and brought home a pregnant mistress—Dmitri’s mother. Though that was decades ago.

I gave him a sideways glance, unsure how to respond.

As if sensing my thoughts, he continued, ""Not that it helped her much. After all, her choice in men was just as bad as yours.""

My lips twitched. ""Well, I’m marrying you now, aren’t I?""

He turned his head and gave me a look. The kind that made me feel positively stupid.

""Who said I was a good choice?"" he murmured.

I grinned. ""Do you know how to cook?"" I asked, remembering his remarks back at the birthday party.

He raised a brow, clearly surprised by the question. ""Of course I do. I’m not incompetent.""

""Do you manage your money well?""

He scoffed. ""Would I be a billionaire if I didn’t?""

""That doesn’t make you a good man?""

A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. ""No, it doesn’t.""

I huffed, crossing my arms. ""Well, on the bright side, you're only going to be my husband for one year, right? So it doesn’t really matter to me whether you’re a good man or not.""

From the corner of my eye, I saw him tilt his head slightly, his gaze lingering on me for a second longer than necessary.

Then he exhaled a quiet, almost amused, ""Right.""

The Next Few Hours Felt Like a Storm.

Nikolai didn’t talk much. He only did.

His presence alone moved things faster than I could have ever imagined.

The medical fees? Paid immediately.

The transfer to the most elite hospital in the city? Handled without a single complication.

The moment the new surgeon arrived, he greeted me with a professional nod and a calm reassurance, ""Rest assured, Mrs. Vetrov. I will do my very best for your mother.""

I exhaled slowly, my chest loosening for the first time in what felt like ages.

The relief was overwhelming.

Then, as the surgeon disappeared behind the doors of the operating room, something inside me cracked.

The view was so familiar. One that I had witnessed only a couple days ago. When Dad got into an accident. But he never made it out alive.

George Anderson had been a foreigner, a tourist visiting Velhaven City when he met my mother thirteen years ago. And in just a year, they had married.

He was the best father I could have ever asked for.

I had been lucky—so incredibly lucky.

When I was six, I was adopted by Beatrix Kovalyova after years in an orphanage that I barely remembered. My memories of that place had become hazy over time, like a bad dream I had long since tried to forget.

But Mom and Dad?

They were my reality. My safe haven.

And now—

Now I was alone.

For the first time in my life after six, neither of them were beside me.

The reality of it hit me hard.

I was twenty-five. Not a child. Not young anymore. More than an adult.

But I didn’t feel like one.

I still felt small, still felt like a little girl reaching out for her mother’s hand.

Please be okay, Mom.

I didn't think I’d survive if she didn’t.

I tried to push the thought away, but it settled in my chest like a weight I couldn't shake.

Then—

A deep voice cut through my spiraling thoughts.

""She’ll be okay. Don’t worry.""

I blinked, glancing to my side.

Nikolai was sitting next to me, his expression solemn for the first time ever.

I exhaled slowly, straightening my back. ""Let’s sign the contract tonight."" My voice was quieter than I intended. ""We can hold an official wedding later if you want."" After all, I owed it to him after he just paid all the bills.

Not to mention that this surgeon would probably charge more than just fifty eight thousand.

He nodded, his gaze still fixed ahead. ""Alright. That works for me.""

""You should leave,"" I murmured. ""I’ll come to your office by the evening.""

He raised a brow. ""Trying to get rid of me?""

I sighed. ""I just need time to ask for a few days of extra leave from college. I also need to call my manager and let her know I won’t be covering my shifts tomorrow.""

A few of us have been running a small community project to help people in Suva meet new friends, and the first round went way better than expected. Over 500 people signed up for the first matches.

A bunch of people have been asking when the next round is happening, so just sharing an update here.

The next round of matches is planned for next week. If you want to meet new people for coffee, seawall walks, board games, gym sessions or weekend plans, that’s pretty much what this whole thing is for.

**How it works, in simple terms:**

• You sign up and answer a short set of questions  
• We put together small groups of six to ten people based on age, availability and interests  
• Each group gets a private chat  
• You choose one simple activity to do within ten days  
• If half the group meets, the crew continues and gets more opportunities to hang

It’s a very low pressure way for people in Suva to make friends outside the usual circles. We were honestly surprised how wholesome the first round felt.

If you want to join the next round, just look for meetfriendssuva Instagram. The sign up link is there.

Happy to answer any questions here too.

1p15vwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1p15vwt/inquiry_about_kundalini_chakras_and_meditation/,"Inquiry about kundalini, chakras and meditation","The first part of this is just context of my life, feel free to skip to the questions if you'd like, I hope this post has comments of insight for all who are spiritual.

I have, as most people who try meditation and give up, tried meditating a few years back and I never understood nor felt many positive effects, besides one time, which I oddly remember, whilst reading a book about listening where I had felt a moment of pure present, I was not thinking, I was here. I still remember the bliss and vibration I had felt which might be why it has still stuck with me to this day even though I had not realised the profoudness of that stillness at that moment. I am writing to ask a few questions because around 3 months ago I moved to a different city, I stopped smoking weed, I don't have a computer (I used to play a lot of games, watch videos, listen to music, watch pornography, etc. for extended periods of time around 6-10 hours of brain activity everyday for the past 4-6 years), I stopped hanging out with people whom always brought me the feeling of not belonging and only communicated based mainly on emotion, whilst also involving me in smoking weed, drinking and certainly other unrewarding activity. And I started meditating, everyday, I began with trataka meditation by staring at a candle, watching the afterimage and of course being aware or my mind. I had also began to notice my ego in every single interaction I had with others, noticing other individuals interactions with ego and most importantly noticing the ego in my own mind at all times. Due to me now living in a dorm with my friend I cannot always meditate in quiet as he is a constant stimuli for my senses, so Instead of only meditating before going to sleep, I began meditating everywhere, being present and aware as much as I can. Around my first month of meditating I had a certain experience I'd like to share: 

Whole day ive been feeling this sort of vibration, static like electricity throughout my body along with slight bliss that came and went. Ive attributed this feeling towards moments of when things sort of ""click"" and i sort of get chills throughout my body and feel joy, ive been attributing this vibration towards these feelings my whole life, an example would be a great piece of music and the chills you get, or something like reading a text and it making so much sense that you feel those chills, that vibration, tingling sensation throughout your body. Today i meditated and focused my attention on it, i realized that i can kinda ""tune"" into it, along it came so much bliss which almost felt overwhelming  because of how powerful it feels it even made me tear up, but it is not a thing that arises alongside emotion, it is like an energy, a vibration you can always feel. In yogic terms this might be prana, what youd call life force that is in all things. I have understood something today and it feels great.


After this experience, I had started to feel that vibration everyday, I feel it specifically everytime I meditate and focus on my breath throughout my whole body, beginning from my back extending to my legs, arms and head, sometimes I feel it only below my neck but when I meditate longer the vibration comes back to my head, sometimes it only activates in certain areas like navel and root chakras without going further. I also feel it at what seem to be random times and at certain times, for example, when I thought about being with and one with Brahman, i felt those vibrations, when I thought to myself of how I want to love myself and all others around me, I felt it. And when I shared with my friends certain wisdom, such as the yogic parts of the mind like chitta, ahamkara, buddhi, manas, when i felt that they were truly listening and I was speaking with such excitment, I felt those vibrations, specifically I noticed them more around my head than body. I wonder if this is just shivers from joy or excitment as i earlier thought or something more. Alongside this feeling I started feeling another thing, for example when i concentrate my attention on my navel, heart or any other chakras i feel some kind of heat, pulsing but my attention has to be really focused and it almost feels like im forcing it and just constraining my blood vessels to give the illusion of something else, I feel slight jitters or shaking when i focus too hard on it aswell.

For a little more context, I am 19, virgin, I don't smoke, I have eaten a certain poisonous mushroom twice and felt profound love for all beings and felt being completely present as if no other moment than right now existed, and just general mushroom goodness and understanding  but no ""heroic dose"" or ego death. I started drinking coffee almost everyday 3 months ago due to me feeling drowsy everyday even though I have always been against caffeine in early stages of life as it can affect brain development and is in general an external source of energy. I have had depression and suicidal thoughts from around the 13-18 years of this life and a general materialistic, rational, atheistic image of life which lead to more confusion yet I always strived for knowledge and a certain part of me for love, I've always felt this strong love coming from within which i wanted to share with somebody but could never really express, I have never gotten into a serious fight as since childhood, even if I was provoked or hit I always avoided contlict as I knew nothing good comes of it, but indirectly doing so I bottled my anger up. Through my teenage years working through depression I started to engage in psychology and philosophy, which helped me seriously understand why and how I acted, this is where i first got acquainted with the self and my environment and how it had programmed me into being who I am from an external source. I also remember my dreams which i have 3-5 per day (If i sleep 7 or more hours), I also lucid dream often ever since the age of 15. Since 15 I have also started to put myself in uncomfortable situations to meet new people, put myself out there so I could become more confident in myself for which the effects were immediate, I also began expressing myself through fashion which allowed me to finally feel like I was someone. Before I was just an introverted ""nobody"" and all those other good ol identities I'd put on myself but with time I started to remove those identities, I never liked putting myself in a box and restricting myself.

When I started meditating I started to notice immediately how my attention was present and my mind stopped fluttering. When i am in the company of my two younger sisters I feel like I am competely present, completely with them and I laugh alongside them at whatever gag tbey are having, this feeling of being in the right now and enjoying without thought, of future and past, feel much like my experience on a certain mushroom. I have been reading on some eastern philosophy and got acquainted with concepts like karma, kundalini, prana, brahman, atman, chakras, etc. And been surprised at myself at how easily i accepted these ideas without much or any thinking at all, as if my whole life I have been prepared to understand them. I am reading the upanishads translated by swami paramananda, autobiography of a yogi and a few others. Specifically I have almost finished the book Enlightenment through the path of kundalini by tara springett and have some questions stemming from them.

My meditation usually involves me sitting in a half lotus or lotus position which I can only sit in for around 40 minutes and then it starts to uncomfortable as my lower body becomes numb, even though I am flexible, so I usually alternate to a corpse position where I meditate while laying down and focus on slow inhale and slower exhale, and stopping breath to be completely still. When I am relaxed I imagine my body to be hollow with golden light inside and focus on my chakras, one by one I try to feel them with my awareness and, admittedly at random i focus on one, like my agna chakra, heart or root not really having a specific motive besides noticing.

As for context goes I believe thats enough and my main reasoning for writing all of this is to ask these questions:


1 - Are these ""vibrations"" I feel my life force, prana, or just something simpler like nerves firing due to excitment?

2 - Is the heat i described more concentrated life force, kundalini, or just something im forcing and is more mechanical?

3 - How do I know which chakra is active? ( I understand it is open from birth I'd like to know whether or not I am ready for kundalini)
 How do I know if it's ""blocked"" when I have no negative emotion?

4 - From the kundalini book I have been reading it mentioned the need to ask your higher self, divine power, a deity for help, guidance and eventually to merge with it. As trying to reach enlightenment independently is practically impossible, I have no guru nor teacher of yoga so I have tried imagining my higher self as golden energy in the shape of an angel channeling its chakra to the chakra I focus on and hugging me and sometimes others for pure love. But is this visualization good or needed to further my spirituality?

5 - Is fasting a good idea for helping activate the chakras, to stimulate prana and how should one approach it?

6 - I've heard alcohol is counterproductive towards the path of kundalini, how about other stimulants such as caffeine? I have heard of techniques which can provide energy for the day, would they help with drowsiness?

7 - What about celibacy, I've heard from different people different answers, ancient yogis believed that to become enlightened you must not release your seed. More modern takes are that you can masturbate or procreate (having sex with the intent to love is even better) but not as an addiction or escape from emotions. 

8 - There are in total 112 meditation techniques which all lead to the same goal, is practicing only one or two enough, should you find the best one suited for you and keep on it? How can you know which practice is best suited for you?

9 - Also kind of a bonus question I just thought of but what about jewelry? I see some buddhists, hindus wearing prayer beads or similar alumets but what about detachment towards it? and does it help with energy work, like copper jewelry?

1p15vkd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p15vkd,Surgery Update!,"
 I want to chat about this last surgery I had from start to finish, in hopes that it will help someone else make their decision about it. 

I had the Panniculectomey Surgery on 10/27/25. Due to me losing almost 200lbs in the last 2 1/2 years. 😜 🤩 😲 😱 I had ALOT of loose skin. (And I’ve still got a lot of loose skin) however, with this surgery, the surgeon cut off all of my stomach below my belly button (my apron belly lol) he also cut out my belly button in the process. My surgeon was able to reconstruct me a “new” belly button during the surgery, which we were worried that it wouldn’t take and I would lose it all together. Thank goodness my “new” belly button is healing great! Anyways, my surgeon cut off over 5lbs of loose skin during the surgery. 😳😱

Now let’s talk about the recovery process. I was able to come home the same day of my surgery. Of course I couldn’t do anything for myself, could barely even move. So I pretty much slept off and on all day and night, while my awesome husband waited on me hand and foot. ❤️
The next two days were rough. I was in quite a bit of pain. And I was feeling helpless because I couldn’t do anything for myself. I couldn’t take a shower until I went back for my follow up appointment, so I was definitely not a nice patient to deal with lol 😂 
On the fourth day I was actually able to move around a little more, but still very limited. I found myself getting very tired very easily even after just getting up to walk to the bathroom. 
Finally, Friday came… (Halloween) I was able to get out and about a little bit, and the hubby took me out to eat a nice dinner for my birthday, then we came home, i took my medicine and I got in the shower. While in the shower I started getting very light headed. I yelled for the hubby to come help me, and the next thing I knew I was laying on the bathroom floor covered in soap and the hubby yelling for our oldest to bring him his phone. I don’t remember passing out, I don’t remember falling to the floor, nothing. So he got me dressed and rushed me to the hospital. Come to find out… the Nitro cream the surgeon gave me for my belly button made my blood pressure drop so low that I passed out. Hubby said my heart beat was 50bpm when he checked it. So we got everything and all my numbers back to where they needed to be and went home. 
Over the weekend, we ran a few errands but nothing major, 
The second week, the hubby had to fly out to Texas for work. I was moving around better by then. But I was about to go crazy sitting at home all day still very limited on what I could do. 
Fast forward to last Wednesday… I was finally able to go back to work.. and things were going great! I felt good, and everything. Then around lunch time I had a sharp burning pain in my stomach. It littfelt like someone was holding a torch on my stomach and would take it off. I toughed it out until the end of the day, but the pain was so bad by the end of the day I was balling on my way home. My assistant teacher/bestie came over right as I got home to check on me and come to find out I had overdid it at work by moving around so much that I busted my incision open… 😭😭😭 so she called my surgeon and thankfully he said bring her in now. So she rushed me to his office. He put some medicine on it and bandaged me up and sent me home with 4 different medications. And told me I was to stay out of work for the remainder of the week 😭
The next two days I pretty much slept off and on all day and night. Doing very little because I still felt like my stomach was on fire. 
On Friday of last week I went back to him for a follow up and to talk about one of the nerve medications he put me on to help with the nerves in my stomach, I told him I didn’t like the way it made me feel, he told me to only take it once a day instead of twice and to take it at night. So that’s what I did. 
Friday night I took my medicine and then got in the shower. Then my head started pounding all of a sudden, and I started getting dizzy, so I yelled for the hubby and he came running in there to help me once again. 🤦🏻‍♀️❤️ once I got situated I messaged my surgeon and told him straight up, if he wanted me to take that medicine anymore then he needed to lower the dose amount. So that’s what he did. 
Fast forward to this week.. I went back to work yesterday. It was a pretty good day. Started hurting a bit around lunch time, but nothing I couldn’t handle. Today, I felt really good. I’m still limited on what I can and cannot do for a few more weeks per the surgeons orders. But I’m managing. Still moving a little slower than normal, but that too will come in time. 

So my honest thoughts on this surgery… is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY! Do I regret having it? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Would I recommend someone that’s thinking about this surgery to go for it and get it done? ABSOLUTELY! 

The recovery has been rough on me, but I brought some of what has happened on myself. I HATE being down and out! I hate not being able to do for myself! I hate just sitting/laying around. I’ve had to learn to slow down and let my body heal. I still have good days and bad days. Some days I feel amazing, and some days I’m hurting and feel like frap.. but I keep telling myself it’s only temporary. And the end results are going to be AMAZING! 

So if you’re thinking about having this surgery… go for it! I’ll cheer you on 100%!

1p15u2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p15u2m,[SEOUL] Best Walking Path to Feel Autumn in Seoul,"📍 Gyeongbokgung-gil, the Street of Museums — Best Walking Path to Feel Autumn in Seoul

Autumn is in full swing in Seoul, and the streets are filled with the colors of falling leaves and gingko trees. If you’re looking for a place to really feel the season, here’s a spot worth checking out.

There’s a path leading to the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) called “Gyeongbokgung-gil, the Street of Museums.” It stretches from Gyeongbokgung Palace to the National Folk Museum of Korea, and finally to the MMCA, blending Korea’s traditional and modern landscapes in one walk.

Along the way, vibrant maple trees and golden gingko trees line the street, creating a perfect route for an autumn stroll. As you continue walking, you’ll eventually arrive at the MMCA.

If you’re curious about the current exhibitions, you can check the official website: mmca.go.kr. (I’ll be posting a more detailed introduction to the MMCA in next week’s Reddit post 😉)

And of course, no autumn walk is complete without a café stop. One place I recommend is Cafe “TUNG” near Anguk Station. It has large floor-to-ceiling windows with stunning views of Changdeokgung Palace and Namsan Mountain, making it an ideal spot to slow down and enjoy a peaceful moment with a cup of coffee.

Take your time and enjoy the rest of the season. 🍂

I have decided that the most romantic thing in the world is not finding someone, but choosing to write to someone you have not yet found. I am thirty five and male and I think about you already, which is to say I think about the idea of you, which is to say I think about the terrifying and wonderful possibility that somewhere out there exists a woman (you, presumably, if you are reading this) who might find it charming rather than deranged that I want to write her emails. Real emails. Penned thoughts. The kind of communication that requires time and intention and the admission that you care enough about someone to sit down and actually compose something true.

The proposal is this: let us pretend we are already in love. Let us write to each other as though we have already survived the difficult parts, the parts where you discover I am weird about cereal temperatures and I discover you have inexplicable feelings about a particular celebrity. Let us skip past the performative first date smalltalk. 

I am not looking for someone to complete me because I am a functional adult human capable of purchasing groceries and operating appliances. I am looking for someone to complicate me, which is approximately one thousand times more interesting. Someone who writes back. Someone who takes this absurd exercise seriously enough to make it real. Someone who understands that the most romantic thing two people can do is sit in separate locations and tell each other true things about themselves across distance.

Here is what I am willing to do: I will send you a picture so you can put a face to these words. I will send you my email address. I will write to you about the books I have been reading (but never finished) and the movies I have watched and the way the city looks when I am working at a coffee shop at three in the afternoon and everyone around me seems to know what they are doing with their lives. I will ask you questions and actually listen to your answers. I will try very hard not to be disappointing, though I will probably fail at this occasionally because that is what humans do.

And here is what I am hoping you will do: write back with the same care and attention and willingness to be vulnerable that this whole thing requires. Send a picture. Send your email. Tell me something true. Tell me something weird. Tell me why you clicked on this post when there are one thousand other posts and one thousand other people and something in you said yes to this particular version of loneliness presented by this particular strange man.

I cannot promise this will lead to anything. I can only promise that I will try. That I will write to you like you matter, because you will, immediately, the moment you write back. That I will treat your words the way words deserve to be treated: as evidence of a real person trying to connect with another real person across the fundamental isolation that we all carry around inside ourselves.

If you’re starting a GLP-1 in Northern Ireland, one of the hardest bits isn’t the injection, it’s figuring out what food your stomach will actually tolerate without staging a full protest.

So here’s a proper **Northern Ireland-style** shopping list. No LA superfoods, no £8 protein puddings, no “eat kale and manifest” nonsense. Just the stuff real people here buy, eat, and survive on.

This list is based on the patterns we at Keltoi see most often with NI patients:  
light meals, simple ingredients, and foods that don’t cause nausea or that slow-down feeling GLP-1s are famous for.

Let’s get into it.



# THE THREE FOOD RULES FOR GLP-1 SHOPPING IN NI

Before the list, three simple truths:

**1. You need protein with every meal**  
Stops dizziness, stabilises appetite, and prevents energy crashes.

**2. Your portions will shrink**  
Don’t overbuy. Half will go straight in the bin otherwise.

**3. The simpler the food, the better it sits**  
Your stomach will not want heavy, greasy, creamy, or huge portions, especially in the early weeks.



# THE NI GLP-1 SHOPPING LIST

To make life easier, it’s split into sections:

• Proteins  
• Carbs that won’t destroy you  
• Fruit & veg (the ones that actually go down well)  
• Snacks that won’t make you feel ropey  
• Drinks that help with nausea  
• Easy ready-made NI options  
• “Emergency” foods for bad nausea days  
• Pharmacy & non-food essentials  
• Things to avoid (for now)





# 1. PROTEINS (your best friend on GLP-1)

Protein is the thing that stops you from feeling weak or dizzy. Most NI patients end up eating way less food, so protein becomes a priority.

# Best NI-friendly protein options

* Chicken fillets
* Pre-cooked chicken chunks (Tesco, M&S, Lidl all fine)
* Eggs (scrambled or boiled are easiest)
* Fish fingers (shockingly good on GLP-1s)
* Salmon portions
* Turkey mince
* Lean beef mince
* Cottage cheese
* Greek yoghurt (high protein versions especially)
* Tuna tins or tuna packets
* Babybels (perfect portion size)
* Ham slices
* Quorn pieces (gentle on the stomach)
* Protein shakes (starter lifesaver)
* Protein yoghurts (but choose light ones, thick ones can feel heavy)

# Why these work

They’re light, easy to portion, and digest well on slowed gastric emptying.



# 2. CARBS THAT WON’T KNOCK YOU SIDEWAYS

Big bowls of pasta or heavy bread can feel like swallowing cement on GLP-1s.

These safer carb options tend to sit well:

# Good carbs

* Baby potatoes
* Sweet potatoes
* Microwave rice pouches (half a pouch is perfect)
* Wraps (lower volume than bread)
* Wheaten bread (half a slice is enough for most)
* Crackers / crackerbread
* Couscous
* Oatcakes
* Pitta bread (cut into strips)
* Wholegrain toast (very thin slice)
* Light microwave porridge pots

# Why these work

They’re lower volume, low grease, and digest smoother.



# 3. FRUIT & VEG THAT ACTUALLY SUIT GLP-1 PATIENTS

Some fruits are way too acidic or fibrous early on (grapes and oranges can be rough).

These ones are ideal:

# Best fruit

* Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
* Bananas (half a banana is often enough)
* Melon
* Peaches (softer)
* Fruit pots
* Apples (peeled if sensitive)

# Best veg

* Carrots (cooked or steamed)
* Peas
* Green beans
* Broccoli (small portion)
* Sweetcorn
* Spinach (mixed into meals)
* Roast root veg

# Avoid early on

* raw onions
* peppers
* spicy veg mixes
* giant salads

Your stomach will riot.



# 4. SNACKS THAT ACTUALLY WORK ON GLP-1S

Snacks become your secret weapon. Some days you’ll eat three tiny meals. Other days you’ll eat one proper meal and two snacks.

# Safe snack options

* Babybel cheese
* Fruit cups
* Zero sugar jelly pots
* Yoghurt
* Crackers with cream cheese
* A handful of nuts
* Grab-and-go chicken bites
* Popcorn (light version)
* Protein bar (half is usually enough)
* Rice cakes
* Mini pretzels
* Saltines (for nausea)

# NI-specific snack wins

* a wee Tayto packet
* wheaten toast with butter (thin bit)
* a small piece of soda farl
* soup with half a slice of batch loaf
* a cuppa with a Rich Tea biscuit



# 5. DRINKS THAT HELP WITH GLP-1 NAUSEA & SLUGGISHNESS

Dehydration is the biggest cause of nausea on GLP-1 medication.

# Best drinks

* Water (obvious but essential)
* Water with electrolyte sachets
* Robinson’s no-sugar squash
* Peppermint tea
* Ginger tea
* 7Up Free
* Coke Zero (yes, really)
* Lucozade Zero
* Volvic flavoured waters

# Avoid if you’re getting nausea

* fizzy drinks right after food
* milky coffees
* sugary juices
* cider (hits hard on GLP-1s)



# 6. READY-MADE NI OPTIONS FOR EASY MEALS

Perfect for days where food feels like a chore.

# Good choices

* M&S Count On Us meals
* Sainsbury’s Be Good To Yourself range
* Tesco Healthy Living meals
* Slimming World frozen meals (portion controlled)
* Cookstown chicken goujons (oven baked)
* Microwaveable veg packs
* Soup tubs (tomato, veg, chicken noodle)
* Deli counter cooked chicken
* Small salad bowls with added protein

# Takeaways that work

* Boojum bowl (not burrito)
* Nando’s butterfly chicken + corn
* Chippy kids meals
* Chinese chicken curry with half rice
* Wagamama ramen (share it)



# 7. “EMERGENCY” FOODS FOR BAD DAYS

When nausea hits, or when you can’t face anything heavy.

This list will save you:

* salted crackers
* ginger biscuits
* sugar-free jelly
* ice lollies
* peppermint tea
* plain toast
* mashed potato
* soup (any kind)
* yoghurt
* cold foods (people tolerate these better)
* dry cereal in small handfuls

These are your “reset” foods.



# 8. PHARMACY & NON-FOOD ESSENTIALS

A few things from Boots/Savers will make your life easier:

* Hydration tablets
* Ginger sweets
* Rennie or Gaviscon
* Peppermint capsules
* Multivitamin (as appetite drops)
* Antacids
* A smaller plate (seriously)
* Meal prep containers
* A water bottle you actually like



# 9. THINGS TO AVOID IN EARLY WEEKS (NI EDITION)

These tend to hit NI patients hardest:

* pasty baps
* fry-ups
* carbonara
* creamy curries
* anything deep fried
* big Chinese takeaways
* pizza meals
* big milky coffees
* alcohol-heavy nights
* big bowls of pasta
* greasy breakfasts
* chippy chips in large portions
* pastries (your stomach will file a complaint)

Later on, some people tolerate these fine, but early days they’re rough.



# A SAMPLE NI GLP-1 SHOPPING BASKET



* Chicken fillets
* Eggs
* Microwave rice
* Baby potatoes
* Greek yoghurt
* Fruit pots
* Zero sugar jelly
* Mini cheese
* Crackers
* Soup tubs
* Wraps
* Bananas
* Berries
* Wheaten bread
* Hydration sachets
* Veg steam bags
* Tuna tins
* Protein bars



# Shopping in NI on GLP-1s Is About Being Practical, Not Perfect

If you can stock your kitchen with:

• protein  
• light carbs  
• safe snacks  
• hydration  
• easy, gentle meals

You’ll avoid 90 percent of the nausea, crashes, and my stomach hates me moments people get on GLP-1s.

I've been on a confusing health journey since 2021 and I'm running out of ideas.
My Story: This all started in 2021 after I ate a huge amount of chocolate. Before that, I had a minor, occasional feeling of not emptying my bowels completely since 2018, but I never thought much of it. The main issue is a burning pain specifically at the tip of my penis. The burning is worst during and right after urination. And pain on the prostate feeling like a ball, when I'm not peeing, I get significant relief. I was initially thought it might be Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS). The urologist said I have calcification on prostate by previous prostatitis but never had any clue of it since can be without symptoms;
The Baffling Part: After suffering for 3 months in 2021, my doctor prescribed Cipro as a last resort. It worked incredibly well-| was completely healed, even the old bowel sensation was gone. Since then, when I have a flare-up (triggered by diet or activity), a short 3-day course of azithromycin makes it disappear. I'll be fine for a year or two. My triggers seem to be: Chocolate Coffee Beer & Spicy Chips Too much masturbation (Recently, even Vitamin C supplements seemed to irritate me) My Dilemma and Question: Every single test I've done is negative, and I've been told it's ""non-bacterial prostatitis."" But if that's true, why do antibiotics solve my problem completely when nothing else does?
I'm in the middle of another flare-up and feeling pretty down. I know taking antibiotics regularly isn't ideal, but it's the only thing that gives me my life back. Has anyone else been in this situation? Is it possible there's an undetectable bacteria, or could the antibiotics be working as a powerful anti-inflammatory? I'm so confused and would appreciate any thoughts.
I know all post about It people feel relief after antibiotics for short amount of time but me it's healed me completely so l'm confused But then it comes back

He probably didn’t even realize how content the cat would be, sitting in a box. 

The park bench was still damp with dew, here at thirty-three past seven in the morning. A misty day thus far, but with some promise of sun. With a quick hiss, he opened the soda. An odd time for it, but he had never liked coffee, and tea was scarce in this land of barbarians. He drank, and lit up a smoke. The fizzy cold drink made him want a puff, and the puff made him want a drink. 

Responsible adults were driving along the streets of this little town, on about their responsible business. Staving off disaster, each of them, though they likely didn’t see it that way. Struggling. Enduring minor miseries in the hope of postponing the other inevitable. 

That young lady in the rusty Tercel looked a bit stressed. She seemed to be talking, maybe arguing, though she was alone in the car. Speakerphone, most likely. Or just crazy. It made little difference. She was off to haul things, or type things, or ring things up, somewhere, to make her contribution to enriching the lives of the wealthy. Her wipers were going at a manic pace, considering the gentle mist. 

Martin Humm controlled the universe, and ruled fate. It wasn’t hard. His car never broke down, since he didn’t have one. He was never late to his job, for similar reasons. He had little to lose. It was not a super position to be in, but he managed. 

There by his foot lay a damp slip of paper. That was annoying. Curiosity made the cat uncertain. 

His glasses were fogged and dappled with drops of lazy rain, but he let it be. It distorted his view of the world, but that was hardly unique. Someone honked their horn. A big SUV, impatient behind a minivan at a stoplight. Better hurry, there. Better rush to the next stoplight so you can honk at someone else. 
Was it a victory? To make the other driver feel bad? To display your finely honed drag-racer level of stoplight reflexes? It didn’t seem like a victory. Not much of a prize. The SUV man did it every morning, probably going through life honking, pushing, convinced of his own importance and the urgency of his arrival. What an odd life. 

*Fine*. 

Martin leaned down and looked at the slip of paper. It was surprisingly dry, actually. Recent, no doubt, and perched on a stray candy wrapper, wobbling in the slight breeze. The date upon it, displayed in archaic dot-matrix, confirmed the futility of despair. 

October fifteenth drawing. Tomorrow. 
He picked it up and examined it. 12, 15, 32, 33, 49, 56. An exceptionally stupid sequence. An almost desperate randomness, a plea to the universe. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 would be just as likely to come up, or a series of primes, a fibonacci sequence, but no, this person had chosen to beg. The 32 and 33—that was a nod to the capricious nature of fate, acknowledging that strange stutters in reality do happen. The whole thing reeked of need. 

Unless they had the computer do it. Impossible to know, though it seemed deliberate, and desperate.
 
But Martin Humm did not rend it in pieces, or fling it away. The numbers were in his head now, and he would know. He would not be able to keep himself from seeking out the results. 

He controlled the universe, but then again, he didn’t. He held the power to decide whether to win the lottery, simply by not buying a ticket. The simple, comforting certainty of despair was his home, but now he was suspended, floating, adrift. 
 
The sun came out, and a warm breeze took his latest puff of smoke on a wild, twisting adventure. Five minutes earlier, and it might have taken the slip of paper. *C’est la vie*. 

For some thirty-odd hours he would wonder. The odds were incalculable. He could determine the chances of winning, of course, but that was merely a beginning. Whoever had purchased the ticket might have known the odds of winning, but had not likely factored in the chances of the ticket falling from their hand, purse, or wallet. 

Martin might get hit by a truck. He might suffer a heart attack from shock when some lunatic in an SUV honked at him. He might drop the ticket in a puddle. The world might end. 

He put the thing in his jacket pocket, trusting that no fluctuations would alter the dot-matrix ink. Disposing of empty bottle and littering with burned-out smoke, he stood, and was deeply aware of his decision to stick to his routine. Any other day, it would be automatic. Today, he walked the same route home as usual on purpose, aware of his choices. He took off his glasses, drying them on his shirt. 

Halfway down the block, he closed his eyes and crossed the street.",1,1763553385.0,DivaythStories,0,1.0,False

1p15ocv,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1p15ocv/once_i_stopped_trying_things_became_so_much_better/,"once i stopped trying, things became so much better","disclaimer: I def at the moment wouldn’t say I have close friends, but I do know now that the people who i meet match the energy I give. I’d rather take it slow and let things grow naturally than force connections!

hii so I just want to share this because I had like a whole 180 experience. Long story short I’ve been going to two different universities and switching degrees and sometime last year I decided I finally want to make friends and have a network. I read all the books and watched all the videos and learned how to communicate better, be a better listener, and I started making plans with new friends. Anyways, like any normal person, I experienced social burnout mostly because I’m naturally an introverted person (AND I NEED MY ME TIME) and I definitely underestimated how much time and energy you have to put into these things. Also people don’t really consider you a friend unless you’ve known each other for some time. For me it was around 3 to 5 months mark before it started to feel like chill friendships.

Let’s just say how it is. Making friends after your 20s is hard. It’s a part time if not a full time job. And a lot of the time people don’t reciprocate the effort back, which you have to be okay with. I fell into a semi depressive mood at some point because of my personal life and goals and also a little because of the lack of effort from others, so I decided to stop trying so hard. I wouldn’t say I was desperate before since I’m a pretty chill person, but I was definitely always the one checking up on friends, making the plans which is good in my opinion. Anyways I stopped doing that and focused on myself, made sure my needs were met first, that I was working on my goals, working out, all of that, and I realized I don’t even have that much time. I also explained this to anyone i felt i was close with, that i was going through something so if i dissapear for awhile thats why. And so I slowly let go of pursuing friends in a accepting way. 

Tell me why at that exact moment people and new people started reaching out to me, asking me to hang out, how i was, and even a coworker of mine wanted to meet and switched shifts so we could work together. That’s when I realized that whole thing about filling your own cup first is actually true! I def was comprimising so much of myself to be there for others at the time. 

If anyone else is in the same phase, I swear the moment you start pouring energy back into yourself instead of chasing people, things shift. Treat yourself with kindness, go buy that coffee, take yourself out on dates, journal, connect with yourself. You attract so much better people, you feel more grounded, and friendships come more naturally without feeling forced. It might take some time but it's def worth.

The last relative has left, the front door clicks shut, and the silence is so heavy it feels like drowning. Ahaan pours two glasses of whiskey with shaking hands. Rhea sits on the long couch in her black mourning saree, the pallu slipping again and again from her shoulder because she has no strength left to fix it. Her eyes are red, swollen, beautiful in the worst way. He hands her the glass. She drinks it like medicine, coughs, then drinks again. They don’t speak for an hour. Only the sound of waves and the occasional clink of ice.Later, when the bottle is half gone, she starts crying without sound, just tears sliding down her cheeks. Ahaan moves closer, pulls her into his lap the way he did when he was small and she was the entire world. Now he is twenty-two, broad and hard with muscle, and she is light, fragile, trembling. Her face buries in his neck. Her tears soak his kurta. His arms tighten around her waist, palms spreading over the bare strip of skin where the saree has ridden up. She feels the heat of his hand and something inside her breaks open.She whispers, voice cracked, “I can’t sleep alone tonight, beta… please.”

  
He carries her to the guest-room couch, lays her down, lies behind her fully clothed. They spoon like children afraid of the dark. Her back against his chest. His arm heavy across her waist. Nothing happens except the slow sync of their breathing and the way her hips, without permission, press back against him once, twice, feeling the unmistakable swell growing against her ass. Neither acknowledges it. They pretend to sleep.Night after night it builds, quiet and unbearable.The first time skin meets skin is when the power fails and the monsoon arrives. Candles flicker. She asks him to help her change out of the wet saree. He stands behind her, fingers trembling as he unhooks her blouse. The fabric falls. Her breasts are heavy, nipples dark and peaked from the cold. He doesn’t touch, only looks. She turns, steps close, and lets the petticoat drop. Naked except for the thin gold chain around her waist. His kurta comes off next. They stand chest to chest, breathing hard, eyes locked, too terrified to move. She reaches first—fingers tracing the line of hair down his stomach, stopping just above the waistband that is already straining. A single tear rolls down her cheek as her hand finally closes around the thick, hot length of her son through the fabric. He groans like he’s been shot.They learn each other in pieces.Morning coffee becomes ritual: she sits on the kitchen counter in just his shirt, legs open, no panties. He stands between them to hand her the cup, lets the ridge of his erection brush her bare pussy with every small movement. Some mornings he stays there, rocking slowly, letting her wetness soak the front of his track pants while she sips coffee and cries silently because it feels so good and so wrong.Showers are shared “to save water.” He washes her hair, fingers massaging her scalp until she whimpers. She soaps his chest, down his abs, wraps a slow hand around his cock and strokes until his forehead thumps against the tile and he comes in thick pulses over her fist. The first time she tastes him is on her knees under the hot water, tears mixing with the spray as she swallows every drop like communion.Nights are the worst and the best.

  
They sleep in the master bed now—his father’s side cold and empty. She wears nothing. He wears nothing. They start on opposite edges and wake tangled, his thigh between hers, her nipples hard against his chest, his cock leaking against her stomach. Some nights they only grind, slow and desperate, her clit dragging along his shaft until she comes with his name muffled against his shoulder. Some nights he slides inside her raw, inch by inch, watching her face twist with guilt and relief. She always cries when he’s fully seated, always whispers “my baby” when he starts to move. He always comes inside her, hips jerking, forehead pressed to hers, both of them shaking with the wrongness and the rightness of it.The last night before his flight, she walks into his childhood room wearing only his late father’s white shirt, unbuttoned completely. Moonlight cuts across her body—full breasts, the curve of her waist, the dark triangle between her thighs already glistening. She locks the door.

  
“I can’t let you leave without knowing all of me,” she says, voice breaking.He stands, lifts her, lays her on his narrow bed where posters of cricketers still watch from the walls. The first kiss is wet, salty, years of grief and love poured into it. He kisses down her throat, sucks each nipple until she arches off the bed, fingers twisted in his hair. When his mouth reaches her pussy she sobs his name loud enough to wake ghosts. He licks her slowly, reverently, two fingers curling inside until she comes so hard her thighs clamp around his head and her back bows off the mattress.She pulls him up, guides him in. They both cry out at the stretch—he is thicker than his father ever was. He moves slow, deep, watching every flicker across her face. Her legs wrap around his waist, heels digging into his back, urging him deeper. “Fill me, beta… please… give Mommy everything.” When he comes it feels endless, pulse after pulse flooding her, marking her, keeping a part of him inside even if he boards that plane. She clutches him so tight her nails draw blood and sobs into his neck, “Don’t go… don’t ever go.”He never does.

  
The ticket is cancelled before sunrise.

  
They lock the doors, draw the curtains, and for weeks the only sounds in the house are her moans echoing down the hallway, the creak of bedsprings, and the soft, broken whispers of “I love you” every time he slides home.",2,1763553062.0,SteamyScriptsAndRP,0,1.0,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1p15hju,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1p15hju/anyone_using_multiple_beans_with_the_ninja_café/,Anyone using multiple beans with the Ninja Café Luxe 701? How do you manage it?,"Hey everyone! I’ve had my Luxe 701 for about a month now and I’m absolutely loving it. There’s definitely been a learning curve, especially with espresso ratios. For some reason, even when my shots taste good and look decent, the machine extracts in like 16 seconds no matter how much I adjust the grind settings (which barely seem to change anything). So I need to use lungo option. But that’s a separate issue for another day.

Now I’ve got another question that I hope someone here has experience with.

At home, I’m basically the closest thing to a “coffee purist.” I’ve been trying different specialty beans and finally found a freshly roasted one that I love. The problem is… the rest of my family doesn’t always like the same beans I do. They drink coffee casually, mostly for lattes, frappes, affogatos, carajillos, tiramisu, etc, and sometimes they want something lighter, darker, or even decaf.

So here’s my concern:
Has anyone tried switching between different beans frequently with this machine?

With the built-in hopper and grinder, it seems tedious to:
	•	add a scoop of a different bean
	•	pull a shot
	•	empty the leftover beans
	•	clean out the grinder
	•	then refill with another coffee

Is anyone actually doing this in practice? Or am I just overcomplicating things?

I’ve even thought about buying a separate grinder, scale, and grinding directly into the portafilter to avoid messing with the hopper… but I’m not sure if that would interfere with the Barista Assist functionality or make things worse.

Basically:
How do you handle multiple coffees (dark, medium, decaf, etc.) with the Ninja Luxe? Is there a practical way to alternate beans without the whole process being a hassle?

Any tips, workarounds, or real-world experience would be awesome. Thanks! 🙏",1,1763552633.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,4,1.0,False

Pondicherry has two versions — the busy café-loving city by day, and the soft, quiet, gold-lit city that exists only before 7 AM.  
 This early-morning cycling route captures the second one.

Cool breeze.  
 Empty French lanes.  
 Temple bells.  
 Sea waves that sound louder than usual.

These are not personal opinions but accounts drawn from multiple verified sources.*

 Imagine this.

You're sitting in a small apartment in Vilnius, Lithuania. Outside, it's cold, gray. The kind of Eastern European winter that seeps into your bones.

You're drinking coffee. Staring at your laptop screen. And you're thinking: *""I'm going to rob Google and Facebook.""*

Not with a gun, not with some complex hacking code that takes years to write.

**With simple** ***emails*****.**

Fake invoices, forged signatures, a company name that isn't yours.

It sounds ridiculous and impossible.

Google and Facebook are tech giants. They have armies of security experts, billion-dollar budgets, and the smartest engineers on the planet working for them.

How could a single man in Lithuania possibly steal from them?

But Evaldas Rimasauskas did exactly that.

**And he didn't steal pocket change. He stole $122 million.**

**This is his story.**

 

**FINDING THE PERFECT DISGUISE**

The year is 2013.

Rimasauskas is 44 years old. He's not a genius hacker; he's not some criminal mastermind with a secret lair and sophisticated technology.

He's just a man who understands something crucial: **people trust what looks official**.

He starts researching, digging. Looking for weak spots.

He discovers something interesting: both Google and Facebook buy hardware from a Taiwanese company called **Quanta Computer Inc.**

This company makes computer parts. Servers, components. The physical stuff that keeps tech giants running.

Google and Facebook send them millions of dollars regularly. The name ""Quanta Computer"" appears on invoices all the time. It's familiar, trusted, and normal.

Rimasauskas sees his opening.

He travels to Latvia, a neighbouring country, easy to reach. He registers a company there.

And he gives it a name, **Quanta Computer Inc.**

The same name as the real company.

It's brilliant in its simplicity. He's not trying to hack into computer systems. He's hacking into something much easier to exploit, **human trust**.

**BUILDING THE PERFECT LIE**

Now comes the hard part, making it believable.

Rimasauskas doesn't just send a quick email saying **""hey, send money.""** That would never work.

He builds an entire fake reality.

First, he creates email addresses. They look almost identical to real Quanta Computer emails. The kind of email that lands in an accountant's inbox and doesn't raise any red flags.

Then he starts making documents, lots of documents.

**Invoices,** professional, detailed line items for computer parts. Prices that match real orders. Dates, reference numbers, everything looks legitimate.

**Contracts,** legal language, terms, and conditions. Pages and pages of official-looking text.

**Letters,** with signatures on corporate letterheads. The Quanta Computer logo is placed perfectly at the top.

Official-looking stamps, the kind that make documents look real, legal, and binding.

He even forges signatures from Google and Facebook executives. Makes it look like they've already approved these purchases.

The level of detail is insane. This is not a rush job; this is careful, methodical, and patient.

He studies how these companies work, how their accounting departments process invoices, what their approval workflows look like, and where the weak points are.

And he finds them.

**WHO GETS THE EMAILS**

Rimasauskas doesn't randomly spam everyone at Google and Facebook.

He targets specific people, **employees in accounting and vendor management departments**.

These are the people who handle payments every single day. They see invoices constantly, they're busy, they're processing dozens, maybe hundreds, of transactions.

And they're *expecting* to see invoices from Quanta Computer. Because Google and Facebook really do business with Quanta Computer. The name is familiar and safe.

So when an email arrives from *""Quanta Computer""* with a professional invoice attached, it doesn't seem suspicious; it seems routine.

The email says something like,

*""Dear Finance Team,*

*Please find attached Invoice #QC-2013-4472 for the recent shipment of server components per our contract agreement dated March 2013. Total amount due: $3,847,000.*

*Payment should be remitted to the following account within 30 days per standard terms.*

*Best regards,*  
*Quanta Computer Inc. - Accounts Receivable""*

Professional, polite, and absolutely normal.

The accounting employee opens it, reviews it, and sees ""Quanta Computer"", a name they recognize and trust. Sees what looks like a legitimate invoice for services that were probably actually ordered.

And they approve the payment.

They initiate a wire transfer, millions of dollars, moving from Google's bank account or Facebook's bank account, into an account controlled by Rimasauskas.

**MONEY FLOWING IN**

It works.

God, it actually works.

The first payment goes through, then another, then another.

**Facebook sends him $99 million.**

Let me say that again, ninety-nine *million* dollars. From one of the richest, most technologically advanced companies on Earth.

**Google sends him $23 million.**

Over **$122 million total** flows into Rimasauskas's accounts **between 2013 and 2015**.

Picture what that looks like in your bank account. You log in one day and see, $3,000,000 deposited. The next week, $5,000,000, then $8,000,000.

**For two years, he pulls this off. Invoice after invoice. Payment after payment.**

Nobody notices.

Think about that. Google and Facebook, companies built on data analysis, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence, don't notice that they're sending tens of millions of dollars to fake accounts.

Why? Because the invoices look real. The company name is real. Everything *seems* legitimate.

And in giant corporations processing thousands of transactions, a few million here and there doesn't trigger immediate red flags. It just looks like normal business expenses.

**HIDING THE MONEY**

But Rimasauskas knows he can't just leave $122 million sitting in one bank account.

That would be stupid, easy to trace, easy to freeze.

So he does what smart criminals do: **he launders it.**

The moment money hits his accounts, he moves it. Fast.

He's set up bank accounts all over the world:

**Latvia** (where his fake company is registered), **Cyprus** (a known hub for murky financial transactions). **Slovakia**, **Lithuania** (his home country), **Hungary**, **Hong Kong** (as far from the U.S. as possible)

The money jumps from country to country, account to account.

$5 million lands in Cyprus. He immediately splits it, $2 million to Hungary, $3 million to Hong Kong. That Hong Kong money gets split again, $1 million to Lithuania, $2 million to Slovakia.

It's like watching someone shuffle cards at lightning speed. The money never stays in one place long enough to grab.

Each transfer makes the trail colder. Each jurisdiction makes it harder to track, each bank adds another layer of paperwork, another legal system, another bureaucratic barrier.

This is the genius part. Even if someone discovers the fraud, recovering the money becomes nearly impossible. It's scattered across six countries, filtered through dozens of accounts, mixed with legitimate transactions.

**Rimasauskas is covering his tracks in real-time.**

**SOMEONE FINALLY NOTICES**

But every scam has a shelf life.

Someone on Google's vendor management team starts asking questions. It's 2015. They're doing a routine audit, checking payments against actual services received.

And something doesn't add up.

They see all these payments to ""Quanta Computer."" Millions and millions of dollars. But when they cross-reference with the *real* Quanta Computer's records, there's a problem.

**The bank account numbers don't match.**

The real Quanta Computer never received these payments. They have no record of these invoices. These transactions don't exist in their system.

Someone made a mistake, or someone is lying.

Google's security team digs deeper. They pull email records, check IP addresses, and trace the money.

**And they realize, they've been robbed.**

Not by hackers breaking into servers, not by some sophisticated malware.

By *fake invoices*.

Google immediately contacts Facebook. *""Check your payments to Quanta Computer. We think we've been scammed.""*

Facebook checks. And they discover the same thing. Millions gone. Same fake company, same scheme.

Both companies panic. They don't announce it publicly because that would be humiliating. Instead, they contact the FBI.

**FINDING THE GHOST**

The FBI starts investigating. They trace the wire transfers, follow the money through that maze of international bank accounts.

Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong.

Each country requires cooperation from local law enforcement, each bank requires legal paperwork, and each transfer takes weeks to document.

But slowly, the picture becomes clear.

All these accounts connect to one person, **Evaldas Rimasauskas**. A Lithuanian citizen living in Vilnius.

The FBI builds its case. They gather evidence, emails, forged documents, bank records, and wire transfer receipts. Hundreds of pages of proof.

They work with Interpol, with Lithuanian authorities, with prosecutors.

And in **March 2017**, Lithuanian police knocked on Rimasauskas's door.

**He's arrested.**

Imagine that moment. You've been living large for years; the money kept flowing, you thought you were untouchable, and you covered your tracks perfectly.

And then armed police show up at your apartment.

**It's over.**

**FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE**

**But Rimasauskas doesn't give up easily.**

He hires a lawyer, a good one, **Snieguole Uzdanaviciene.**

She argues that Rimasauskas should be tried in Lithuania, not the United States. **""The crimes were committed on Lithuanian territory,""** she says. **""Using Lithuanian tools. Lithuanian internet. He never set foot in America.""**

It's a decent argument, technically true.

But the victims are American companies. The money was stolen from American bank accounts, and the fake invoices were sent to American employees.

The Lithuanian court makes its decision, **Extradition approved**.

Rimasauskas will face trial in the United States.

In **July 2017**, the court officially ordered his extradition.

And in **August 2017**, U.S. federal agents arrived in Lithuania, took custody of Rimasauskas, and put him on a plane.

**Destination: New York City.**

The Southern District of New York, one of the most powerful federal courts in America. The same court that prosecutes Wall Street criminals, mob bosses, and international terrorists.

**Rimasauskas is now in the big leagues.**

**FACING THE EVIDENCE**

When he first arrives in New York, Rimasauskas pleads not guilty.

Maybe he thinks he can fight it, maybe his lawyers tell him there's a chance.

But as the months pass, reality sets in.

The evidence is overwhelming. The FBI has everything:

There's no defence, no way to argue innocence.

So in **March 2019**, almost two years after his arrest, Rimasauskas changed his plea.

In a Manhattan federal courtroom, speaking through an interpreter, he says,

*""I fully understand these actions were fraudulent.""*

He pleads guilty to **Wire fraud,** **three counts of money laundering**, and **aggravated identity theft.**

**PAYING THE PRICE**

December 18, 2019.

Federal court, Manhattan.

Judge George B. Daniels sits behind the bench. Rimasauskas stands before him.

The prosecutors want at least nine years in prison, maybe more. This is one of the biggest fraud cases in history. The victims are two of the most valuable companies on Earth.

But Judge Daniels considers the circumstances. Rimasauskas cooperated, he pleaded guilty, he showed remorse. **5 years in federal prison.** **2 years supervised release after prison.** **Forfeiture of $49,738,559.41**, nearly $50 million in assets seized.

**Restitution of $26,479,079.24**, money he must pay back to Google and Facebook.

Let's break that down.

Five years doesn't sound like much for stealing $122 million. Wire fraud alone carries a maximum of 20 years per count. Money laundering, another 20 years per count. Aggravated identity theft, up to 15 years.

**He could have gotten 80+ years. Life in prison, essentially.**

But he got five.

Because he cooperated, because he pleaded guilty, because the judge showed mercy.

But the financial penalties are crushing. Almost $50 million was seized, money found in his accounts, frozen, and confiscated. And another $26 million he still owes.

Even if he lives to be 100, he'll never pay that back.

**WHERE IS HE NOW?**

Rimasauskas entered the federal prison system in December 2019.

Five years. Release date, approximately December 2024.

We're now in **November 2025**. That means he's either,

**Already released.** Five years have passed. If he behaved in prison, earned good time credits, he's out.

**On supervised release.** For the next two years, he reports to a probation officer. He can't leave the country. Can't use computers without permission. Lives under constant monitoring.

**Facing deportation.** This is almost certain. He's not a U.S. citizen. He's a convicted felon. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will deport him back to Lithuania.

So right now, Rimasauskas is probably back home in Lithuania. Free, but broke. Monitored, marked as an international fraudster.

**He still owes $26 million.** The U.S. government will hunt that money forever. They'll seize any assets they find, garnish any wages he earns. He'll never be financially free again.

And he's famous now, in the worst way. His name appears in every article about corporate fraud, business email compromise, and social engineering attacks.

He can't run another scam. Everyone knows his face, his name, his methods.

**BUT HERE IS THE FINAL TWIST**

Here's the one piece of good news in this story.

The FBI and international law enforcement actually recovered a huge chunk of the stolen money.

Remember all those bank accounts Rimasauskas set up? In Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong?

Law enforcement traced every single one; they worked with banks in all six countries, they filed legal motions, and they froze accounts.

**And they seized almost $50 million.**

It wasn't easy; it took years. It required cooperation from multiple governments, but they did it.

That money was returned to Google and Facebook.

**So in the end, Rimasauskas successfully stole $122 million, but only got to keep about $73 million.** And even most of that was probably spent or lost.

The nearly $50 million in forfeiture represents a rare victory. Most fraud cases never recover the money. It disappears into the global financial system forever.

But the FBI made a statement with this case, **We will find you, we will track the money, we will get it back.**

Even if you scatter it across six countries. Even if you use sophisticated money laundering techniques. Even if you think you're safe in Eastern Europe.

The arms of American justice are long.

**THE MAN BEHIND THE CRIME**

So who was Evaldas Rimasauskas, really?

Not much is known about his personal life. **He wasn't a criminal mastermind from birth. He didn't have a history of major crimes before this. He was just a regular guy who saw an opportunity and took it.**

Maybe he was desperate, maybe he was greedy, maybe he just thought, **""Why not? What's the worst that could happen?""** Well, now he knows.

**UNANSWERED QUESTION**

We moved to Basel right after he was born for my fiancé’s job, so I’ve been navigating new motherhood in a new city all at once. Being a mum is the hardest and the easiest thing in the world. I love raising this little human more than anything, but I also quite miss some adult girlfriends company. Honestly, it kind of feels like lockdown again, just for me this time, while the rest of the world keeps going. 

I’m quite an introverted and find it easier to connect in smaller groups or 121. That said, I do have a good sense of humour (I guess!). I was wondering if there are any other mums around Basel (we’re in Gundeli) who also miss their 'old self' a bit and would be up for meeting with or without babies.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

    But I let it slip
    let someone else claim it
    even though it was mine to take.

    a naive belief that the essence

    but no compassion met me,

    vanquished by my own thoughts.
    The night still burns inside my memory,
    its fight replaying, its outcome fixed.
    
    Now, as the memory lingers, I ask
    Can I reclaim the essence
    that was washed from me?
    Can I take another’s chance,
    give up what might make me whole

    And as my look of life fades,
    so will the once-bewitching clarity.
    
    In an undying struggle
    where people exist to please
    and please to exist
    when will I ever truly exist?
    When will I shave off my part from this ice?

    instead of another resemblance;
    to know the new instead of the past
    something that will outlast even this
    grey, withered soul in my broken heart.

    so did the body, I muttered.
    For a while, so did I
    until the voice gave in.
    I fell into the same habit,
    trapped in a snare like a rabbit.
    
    I kept falling from the efforts I made, 
    sitting in the dark with no one
    but myself to blame.
    
    In the undying condition I exist in,
    in the never-ending cycle I stepped into 
    was there ever any hope to begin with,
    or just another means to make amends with?

    until the same ghost appeared
    the one I left to rot.

    how the coffee lingered and stewed.
    As I left, I recalled
    how quietly sad you were.
    
    Now the image has turned black,
    but the frown on your rosy lips remains;
    unbridled, yet estranged
    just a shadow of you remains.
    
    Those despairing words,
    those echoes once full of heart
    were enough for me to let go,
    to let go of the idea of you.

Places that I regret not being able to make time for:

- Fuji area: Izu peninsula (Mt Omuro and Izu Shaboten Zoo)

- Nagano area: Kusatsu onsen

- Kyoto area: Kurama Mountain

- Tokyo area: The National Art Center

- Tokyo area: Ghibli Museum (we didn't win the tickets lottery but wouldn't have had the time anyway)


Highlights:

1 - Nakasendo Trail: I expected I would like it, but I think it exceed my expectations, probably even just the Ichikokutochi Tateba teahouse was worth the trip.

2 - Kamakura: I knew it was famous for a reason, but was worried about the crowds, couldn't appreciate the Kotoku-in, it was so packed that we stayed very little, but everything else was absurdly beutiful.

3 - Yusai-Tei Gallery: I had seen many video and pics before going, but it is more impressive in person. Probably we were also lucky... the hydrangeas had just been planted and it was raining, so we arrived tired and miserable but we shed our raincoat and backpacks and had a chance to relax and properly soak in the calm and rainy atmosphere.

4 - Arbor tea pavillion in Heian Shrine Garden: unexpected, super good vibes... also it wasn't gated off and secluded near the gift shop like in other temples, it was open and from there you could still see most of the east garden)

5 - Manyo botanical garden: yes, it was overcrowded, but it was wisteria peak season... that was to be expected! I've never seen anything like that, absolutely 


Lessons learned:

1 - busses leave early (they're worse and more confusing than trains... as an italian, if really applying myself, I can be on time, but, being early is unfathomable)

2 - things close earlier than you expect and can vary on different days (check opening times and assume last admission is half an hour before that)

3 - things open later than expected too (again check opening times in advance which for me is really hard because I have a general idea of what I want to do but don't like having a schedule, I prefer going with the flow and enjoy the moment... one cannot plan everything, it's too stressing...)

4 - you have to learn to compromise
(find the things you and the other in your group are more interested in and want to prioritise. I usually prefer to either do sightseeing or outdoor activities first thing in the morning since nature is alway open and it's easier to beat the crowds if you're out early on popular sites, but opening hours for museums and activities are short, so choose carefully.)

5 - make a budget 
(but don't think too hard about money, if you like something don't believe you'll be back for it later, because you won't.)

6 - stick to the small claw machines (they're easier to win and... will you really have space to bring back a huge plush or a oddly shaped anime figure?)

7 - don't hunt fancy restaurants 
(Booking haead can be a shackle on your shedule, and if you've got no booking be prepared to wait in long lines, even at odd hours, for famous spots. But let's face it, most food will be extremely tasty, even stuff from the combini. The only bad meal I had in Japan was a rolled omelette ekiben I picked at the station to eat on the Bullet train from Osaka to Tokyo, anything from seven eleven would have been nicer and cheaper)

8 - footwear is key
(Bring confortable stuff but when in doubt buy gel insoles, in a pinch cheap ones from daiso will do the trick)

9 - just in general be prepared
(You'll likely be out all day so think of what you use during a day and bring it with you, but test your bag, it needs to be comfy if you'll wear it all day. The same goes for the rest of your gear and luggage, think about your kit.)

10 - charging suica cards is flexible you can also use coins not just notes and you can withdraw what you charged (this unfortunately I learned after I came back. We just tried not too have too much balance left over in the card before leaving)


Things that worked out for me:
- starting with smaller cities
- balancing outdoor activities and cultural visits
- bringing a stamp book
- getting goshuin-cho on the first temple I visited


Viral Cafes reviews:

Nagano: Neko Machi Eki Sha cat station 9/10 
Absolutely beautiful, woth a detour. Super curated, almost had me get over not getting tickets to the ghibli museum. The sweets were good but later in the day the selection was very small, but that mean everything's fresh at least right?

Kichijoji: Petit Mura 8/10 
The service is a bit slow, so if you arrive on a full house, it's impossible to get a table inside or you'll have to wait for like an hour... we got lucky, and we were able to be sat outside, which is even prettier than inside, but felt a bit on display since it's a popular place and there's a lot of people just looking around. The food was good and the little shop inside was adorable.

Harajuko: Cat Cafe Mocha 7/10 
Mocha is a chain with consistent reviews, and I can attest that the cats in this location at least didn't seem mistreated and weren't forced to interact with guests and had space to themselves. Which is important because cats are cats and if they're not interested they're not interested, but I was satisfied just admiring them from afar and I'd rather they be like that than overfeed by snacks or on catnip.
So it was a pleasant enough experience, in the spectrum of animal cafes this wasn't bad, I would never go to a cafe that houses wild animals, but I would probably not go to an other cat cafe either... a cafe where happens to live a cat, though? Yes, highly probable. ",1,1763551836.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1p15648,https://i.redd.it/po0l47g9872g1.png,New tool: buy maps easier with Better Map Search,"Hey guys,

I am happy to announce the community one more tool I found so fun to build and use myself this League.

👉  [https://mapsearch.easyexile.tools/](https://mapsearch.easyexile.tools/)

**The idea behind it:**  
The async trade is absolutely amazing for the maps - from the atlas progression to late-game map purchases. I can easily find exactly the map I want to run - without the annoying mods and with desired stats. 

However, I still find the trade engine somewhat clunky for this. I have to search for dozen of mods individually, exclude them, include another ones in another group etc.

\--- So the idea behind Better Map Search is:   
**combine power of async trade 🔥**   
with **ease of use** 🤙 of tools such as GOATed [Poe Regex](https://poe.re/#/maps).

\---

**The tool now lets you:**  
\- choose what kind of map (type, rarity, tier, etc) you **want to run**  
\- **define desired stats and modifiers** (iiq, iir, scarabs drop chance, etc)  
\- **exclude any mods you can't or don't want to run** as well as include the desired ones (I heavily inspired this by mentioned POE Regex to keep the experience familiar and smooth)  
\- choose your price range, league and then **go straight to the Trade**  
\- **save any queries for later** and switch between them on demand

  
In a way it's just an external interface to the official PoE trade website, but I find it so much easier to just rule out some mods with a toggle, rather than finding and preserving them in the main tool. Hopefully you'll too! 🤞

Looking forward to your feedback! I already have some ideas lined up like:  
\- query share, so you can easily adapt and save settings from your friends or content creators  
\- regex handling, so you can easily translate your existing regexes into trade queries  
\- additional types of maps handling (like elder, blighted maps, etc) 

but I am curious on how you find this early version of the tool and your ideas.

*PS. I also finally encapsulated my tools under one roof (*[easyexile.tools](http://www.easyexile.tools)*) and will continue to release future utilities there as well. There's at least one more tool I am planning to build during 3.27 :)*

1p152bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p152bf/am_i_the_ahole_for_unknowingly_patting_my_boss/,Am I the a-hole for unknowingly patting my boss? (More context in post),"So I work with an older lady who is my boss(45F), she’s nice and behaves pretty motherly to the crew I work with myself included. Though she’s also very blunt and honest and will tell you when you mess up. I’ll call her Boss for the sake of this post. Then there is me, (24M) I am a cashier at the place we both work on graveyards. Then there is the person (40?M) who instigated my desire to know if I was in the wrong here. I’ll call him Guy. Guy is a regular customer and ‘friends’ (he’s in an open marriage and my boss is one of his dates or whatever you might call them) with Boss. They often head out of the store when he shows up and talk for a while then he leaves. 

For context Boss usually doesn’t like people to touch her. I knew this and did not touch her. However a few months ago she had patted me when I was sad after I lost a pet to cancer. She then lost a dog a few months after that and I also patted her on the back which she said was fine before hand. I just sort of took that as an okay to pat her on the shoulder if she was not feeling well and she had never corrected me afterwards so I stupidly thought it was fine. 

Tonight Guy came in and saw me pat Boss after she told me she hadn’t slept for the last day and a half as she was dealing with attempting to adopt a puppy from somewhere else. Guy saw me pat her and suddenly glared at me. Then made his coffee (my work has a coffee area for guests to make which me and Boss were stocking) Afterwards he said something to Becca as they were closer together and I didn’t hear it. Then they went to go outside after Guy paid for his coffee and as Boss went outside ahead of him he suddenly turned back and said “I better not ever catch you touching her again. Do we have an understanding?” (To the best of my memory this is what he said) His face was bright red and his jaw was clenched in such a way I knew he was definitely serious (I had when he first got my attention though he was trying to be silly, as he usually was a very jokey guy). He then made a gesture but I was kinda shocked and didn’t catch it. I just said something to the effect of sure of course and he went outside.

After Boss came back in when they finished talking I asked her if she was uncomfortable with my patting her and she restated her usual feelings that usually no but that she knew I wasn’t doing it to be weird so she was normally fine with it. I then told her what Guy had said and she seemed to fine it funny and said he’d asked her if she usually just let me touch her like that and she has said I’m not too uncomfortable about it. (Paraphrasing of course but that’s the rough gist of what she said they said to each other)

Now I’m just really confused I know I usually am really bad at picking up social cues and from what Boss said it seemed fine but they anger Guy had just seems so serious that I must have missed something that meant she didn’t like my patting her. I don’t know am I the a-hole?

6 night stay nov 12 -18
Room category booked: sky chamber king with empire view, 26th floor (I believe top floor is 38). Great view of ESB but not high enough for much of a water view
Room category received: no upgrade 

My travel companion booked a standard sky chamber king and was upgraded to empire view, also on 26th floor. 

Acknowledgement /thank you for booking the edit was verbalised at check in, along with information detailing the perks. 

$100 resort credit had room service, spa, and mini bar listed as exclusions, which seems pretty stingy. They did appear to apply it to my one room service meal apart from gratuity and tax. TBD if minibar was credited as those charges have yet to come thru

Free breakfast for 2: you got 1 breakfast entree in addition to drip coffee and basic juices.  Espresso drinks as well as the fancier juices were charged extra, as were side orders, pastries etc, which were in the $8-10 range each. 

Welcome amenity: received a few gourmet cookies waiting in the room, which were tasty

Late check out: asked for 2 pm, was given 1 pm, which I believe is the standard time they give to any guest who asks

Early check in: did not apply as we arrived after published check in time 

WiFi: received free WiFi with login, but I think this is the same for any guests. 

So all in all, the perks were nice to have but not mind blowing in my particular experience.  Not being able to use the credit on mini bar or room service was the biggest surprise, although the rule seems to be applied inconsistently. 

Upgrades seem to be to a better view rather than basic room to suite.  The hotel being fairly full likely played a role in this.

# *Actual Wolf of Wall Street*  

---  

# **CHAPTER 4 — The Uncle, the Audit, and the Tires**

Long before Lou became an accidental oracle of Nordic debt markets, he had been the shame—and occasional pride—of a very different empire: *Uncle Bristow’s Tire & Auto Kingdom*, a string of 38 regional tire shops run by a man with the charisma of a drill sergeant and the posture of a refrigerator.

To understand the audit, one must understand the uncle.
And to understand the uncle, one must understand the tires.

They were everywhere.

Uncle Bristow didn’t store tires so much as worship them. Every shop had walls lined with rubber rings like ceremonial wreaths. The office had a tire repurposed as a coffee table. His favorite chair was a tire. His second-favorite was two tires stacked. His passport photo looked vaguely like a tire.

He had no children, no spouse, no hobbies, and no discernible joy except the profit margins on Goodyears.

So when Lou—freshly minted Wall Street wolf—sent a politely forged email requesting temporary access to the *Tire Kingdom’s* dormant investment reserve for “strategic leverage,” Uncle Bristow didn’t question it.

He didn’t even read it.

He simply printed the email, stapled it to his refrigerator, and told a teenager at the counter to “execute whatever the boy says—he’s in finance now, they know things about percentages.”

Thus, Lou acquired 2.8 million dollars of tire-backed liquidity.

Thus, an audit was born.

---

It arrived one crisp Wednesday morning on Levée Capital’s 49th floor: a man in a short-sleeve button-up shirt, clip-on tie, and the conviction of someone who believes tax law is a battlefield. He introduced himself as **Rutherford Primm**, regional IRS auditor and “enthusiast of compliance.”

He also introduced a folder so thick it required two hands.

“I’m here,” Primm said, “regarding suspicious movements in the financial accounts of *Bristow’s Tire & Auto Kingdom*—movements which appear to lead… here.”

The trading floor fell silent.

Partners fled like pigeons.  
Analysts ducked under desks.  
Someone whispered, “Oh God, the wolf committed securities fraud,” with the same stunned reverence as one would say, “The wolf painted the Sistine Chapel.”

Primm did not blink.  
Primm did not scare.  
Primm did not respect wolves.

Lou, meanwhile, sat on a leather ottoman, licking the remnants of a conference-room muffin from his paw, reasonably confident that he was merely watching a slow-moving creature announce itself.

“Sir,” Primm continued, pointing at Lou with the bureaucratic authority of a traffic cone, “I need to know why your firm received a direct capital infusion routed through 38 separate tire shops across the Midwest, all occurring in the 48-hour window immediately preceding your ‘Baltic spike’ windfall.”

A partner stepped forward, sweating like a faucet in August.  
“Hypothetically,” he stammered, “if someone were to have made an unconventional liquidity request—”

“Fraudulent,” said Primm.

“—fraudulent liquidity request”—the partner swallowed—“on behalf of a… wolf… would that constitute a failure of internal controls or a misunderstanding of asset classes?”

Rutherford Primm stared at him.  
Then at Lou.  
Then back at the partner.

“Is the wolf,” he asked, slowly, “on payroll?”

Someone nodded.  
Someone else whispered, “He has stock options.”

Primm wrote something down with the grim intensity of a monk copying scripture.  
“Then we are,” he said flatly, “in violation territory.”

A hush rolled across the room like fog over a battlefield.

And then Lou—who had no understanding of taxes but an impeccable sense for tension—stood up.

Not dramatically.  
Not heroically.  
Just… stood.

But to the humans around him, who had collectively mythologized every twitch of his tail into a market prophecy, the gesture detonated across their interpretations like a flare.

“He’s taking responsibility,” someone whispered.  
“He’s facing the music.”  
“No. Wait. He’s intimidating the auditor.”

Primm did not feel intimidated.

He did, however, feel slightly confused when Lou stepped calmly to the folder, placed one heavy paw onto the stack of documents, and pushed downward—not maliciously, simply curiously—sending the entire audit file cascading onto the floor.

Traders gasped.  
Analysts choked.  
A partner whispered, glassy-eyed, “He’s executing a clean slate doctrine.”

Before anyone could intervene, Lou nudged the papers again, scattering them further. Primm lunged to collect them, and in that moment—while men scrambled after loose pages on hands and knees—Lou wandered away, utterly unbothered.

To him, it was Tuesday.  
To Levée Capital, it was a divine performance.
To Rutherford Primm… it was grounds for a deeper investigation.

Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, Uncle Bristow stood in the doorway of his flagship shop, arms crossed, staring up at the sky like a man considering a cosmic betrayal.

Because at that exact moment, he had just received an automated bank notification:

**ACCOUNT OVERDRAWN BY $2,799,482.17**

Bristow did not scream.  
He did not faint.

He simply whispered, with the quiet resignation of a man whose entire worldview could be expressed in vulcanized rubber:

“…the hell’s my wolf been doing?”

He grabbed his keys.  
He grabbed his spare tires.  
He grabbed a map of Manhattan.

The audit was coming.  
But so was the uncle.

And as anyone familiar with finance or family knows:

Nothing destabilizes a system like a man who has loved only one thing his entire life discovering someone else has borrowed it.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I've realized most of us, morios, we're stuck in a comrade lifestyle;  where you struggle for daily basic needs like food, water, Internet. So here's a trick i learnt about food (izo zingine someone else atakam nazo) 
1. Ukienda kibandaski, kula just 1 or 2 chapos max na alot of beans na uongeze ka blueband ata one spoons. 
After ordering meza iyo beans kwanza then chapo teremsha last ata kama ni na ka beans kiasi. 
2. Ukiitisha tea ama coffee, weka kaskari kadogo sana ama ata usieke ukunywe ivo 
3. Ukiitisha supu ugali, manja iyo supu na nyaks yake kwanza alafu sasa ugali ije last. Bado apa utaapply ile trick ya ugali last na kasupu kadogo. Na sio lazma umalize iyo sembe yote, bro. Utaeza ambia mathee wa kibandaski  apee mapaka wa mtaa  as charity from you, hehe. 
4. Kama comrade umetulia kejani na huna snacks, do ivi chukua maji weka kapinch ya salt ukunywe uskie greatness imerudi ASAP 
5. Njugu. Njugu ye comrade.  Peanut ama groundnutsziwe constantly kwa keja. 
6. Avoid tea/coffee na mandazi ama chapati; iyo menu issano 👎 👎 


Kumaliza njaa na weakness a comrade needs: 
1. Blueband ama any source of fat yenye unaijua ata kma ni ile mafuta ya  wamasai ya kondoo, bora ni fats
2. Salt - piga pinches kwa maji kijana, hapa hakuna kitu kama ukikuka chumvi nyingi utazeeka. No fucking way. Wahenga walisema hii shiet ku gatekeep hii info.
3. Nuts - na sio izo vitu unataka kufkiria bro, im not advocating for LGtv+, naongelea peanuts ama groundnuts. Nunua ata kama ni zile hazija roastiwa ujipange nazo comrade

When people shop online, we often give them too many choices, facts, and stats. But the illusion of having too many options actually makes people feel uncertain, anxious, and unable to make a choice. This is what psychologists call the ""Paradox of Choice.""



Most e-commerce sites only appeal to the rational 5% of the brain, which is not what makes people buy things.



The Unseen Issue: Decision Fatigue

We all want to be in charge and have freedom. When people feel overwhelmed, their emotional system (System 1) tells them that the experience is ""too hard.""

What happened? People leave. If you're overwhelmed, the easiest thing to do is nothing.



Too much complexity and mental strain

The more options there are, the harder it is to think about them. The rational mind, or System 2, takes over, which makes decisions take longer and makes cognitive ease go down. Cognitive ease is the feeling of simplicity and familiarity that makes intuitive choices easy.

The result: frustration, paralysis, and empty carts.



The Solution: The Minimal Choice Framework (Hobson's +1 Effect)

How do you help people get through your funnel without making them feel too busy?



* Never give people just one choice. A ""buy or don't buy"" decision makes people less likely to act.
* Use two or three choices. This changes the question from ""Should I buy?"" to ""Should I pick A or B?""
* Use a decoy option: add a third choice that is clearly worse than your target option to make it look better.

Make cognitive ease your top priority. Make sure that every step is easy, familiar, and smooth so that decisions seem easy.",1,1763550585.0,CROlab,0,1.0,False

Name: Robert Clifton
Aliases:Rob, Pat, Henry
Species:Unknown (weird ahh decaying plant thing)
Age:late 20’s physically
Gender:Genderqueer
Pronouns: He/they/she/it
(Prefers he/they)
Likes:delivering post (whether it would be letters, postcards, or parcels) coffee infused desserts, tea, soups, desserts, pastries, biscuits/cookies (likes any biscuits/cookies and eats them with a cup of tea) drawing, gardening.

Dislikes:Yelling, microaggressions by either their peers or recipients, annoying recipients, hanging out with peers (they’re an introvert)

Personality:They are a kind and polite postman who loves his job and is always helpful. But they’re also seems to be shy and anxious
with the addition of him being a introvert and camera shy to the public.

Fun facts:Their right eye doesn’t have an iris and has just one large dilated pupil. Speaking of their right eye the eye is also blind and has constant eye pain from it.
They may have anxiety.
He is slightly taller than canon Pat.
They currently have two forms the first being the false form aka his human form which almost resembles canon Pat, and the second one being his true form also known as their original form.
Him transforming into his true form is very rare and he did it only 2 times.

2. Signora Wave (9/10): This one is from Dubai, the bottle in itself is very self explanatory. This is a pure Coolwater clone. Longevity is average again. If you love coolwater, you will love this smell.  
3. mCaffeine Fein (8.5/10): This is my new daily driver. Lasting is crazy good for the price (650/-). although it shows coffee  flavor, it isn't rather it has a alcoholic vanilla smell which is mild and pleasant to smell. Loving it.  
4. ElPaso (5.5/10): One word Bad. Lasting nil. The smell feels like something aftershave lotion from a Barbour shop. This was a gift. IDK for how much is this sold in India.  
5. Hamilton (7/10): This was also a gift. But the smell felt premium. From a brand like Denver, i never expected this. 10 sprays can give you somewhat longevity. Pretty decent for the price it comes.  
6. Bellavita Mango (7/10): I like mango smell, so it was more of a gimmick buy. Won't say disappointed coz I wore it during Summer and even got compliments for the smell. It is not very heavy Frooti kind of mango, but a subtle hint of it. Good for summers, but then longevity was big question mark  
7. Bellavita Honey (7/10): This one came from a tester pack. I kept the Honey and gave away the rest. The smell is sweet not bad. I dont know about the longevity tbh. I have heard testers give you a better smell and longevity than the actual pack to make you buy. I dont know if this is true or not.

Commercial Security Camera Upgrade on the Upper West Side (10024) – Full Job Breakdown by Abstract Enterprises Security Systems

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a detailed breakdown of a project we wrapped up last night for anyone in the Upper West Side (10024) who owns, manages, or works in a business and has been considering a security upgrade. There are a ton of small businesses in this neighborhood dealing with heavy foot traffic, late-night activity, and the usual NYC challenges, so hopefully this helps someone who’s been thinking about improving their camera system.

We just finished a complete commercial security camera upgrade for Salon West, located at 625 Amsterdam Ave. If you’re familiar with that area, you know it’s one of the busiest corridors on the UWS — lots of pedestrian traffic, restaurants, salons, gyms, coffee shops, retail spots, and residential buildings all packed together. It sits right between Amsterdam Ave, Broadway, Columbus Ave, West 86th Street, West 87th Street, West End Ave, Central Park West, and close to the 1/2/3 train line, Riverside Park, and Central Park. Businesses in this zone absolutely need reliable, modern security.

Salon West reached out because their existing camera system was old, grainy, and missing coverage in key areas. They needed something sharper, smarter, and more comprehensive. Here’s what the upgrade included:

• Installation of new 4K commercial-grade cameras (interior + exterior)
• Full night-vision capability for the storefront and interior rooms
• Motion-activated recording with custom sensitivity zones
• New NVR system with reliable storage, remote access, and high-resolution playback
• Clean rewiring to replace outdated cables and remove old clutter
• Entrance monitoring, including clear face-level angles for customers arriving and leaving
• Reception area coverage for staff safety and transaction visibility
• Styling station coverage for liability protection and theft prevention
• Back-room cameras for inventory protection and staff safety
• Exterior visibility designed around the flow of traffic on Amsterdam Ave

The Upper West Side is unique because businesses often share walls, sit beneath residential units, or operate in narrow, older storefront spaces. That means you can’t just hang a camera anywhere. You have to think about reflections from glass, sidewalk glare, street lighting, blind spots around columns, ceiling height, entry angles, and how the space is used during busy hours. We mapped out the entire layout of the salon and built the system around how people naturally move throughout the space.

One big improvement was upgrading from their old DVR to a modern NVR system. The difference in clarity and playback quality is massive. Owners can now view the footage remotely, zoom in without losing detail, and access everything securely from their phones or computers. The night-vision upgrade alone made a huge difference — no more washed-out, grainy footage at night.

For anyone running a business on the UWS, especially around Amsterdam Ave, Broadway, Columbus Ave, West End Ave, the Museum of Natural History area, or anywhere near the busy intersections by the 1/2/3 trains, a reliable camera system isn’t optional anymore. Between foot traffic, late-night activity, deliveries, theft risks, and general liability concerns, modern commercial security cameras are one of the most important investments you can make.

If anyone in the neighborhood (or anywhere in NYC) is considering a security upgrade — whether it’s a small store, salon, café, office, medical space, boutique, or any commercial storefront — feel free to ask questions. I’m always happy to break down what equipment makes sense, how coverage should be planned, or what to avoid when upgrading.

This job really came out great and the owners were happy with how much cleaner, sharper, and more reliable their system is now.

If you want help or ideas for your own space, or want a walkthrough of what a proper setup looks like, I’m around.

So here's a trick i learnt about food (izo zingine someone else atakam nazo) 
1. Ukienda kibandaski, kula just 1 or 2 chapos max na alot of beans na uongeze ka blueband ata one spoons. 
After ordering meza iyo beans kwanza then chapo teremsha last ata kama ni na ka beans kiasi. 
2. Ukiitisha tea ama coffee, weka kaskari kadogo sana ama ata usieke ukunywe ivo 
3. Ukiitisha supu ugali, manja iyo supu na nyaks yake kwanza alafu sasa ugali ije last. Bado apa utaapply ile trick ya ugali last na kasupu kadogo. Na sio lazma umalize iyo sembe yote, bro. Utaeza ambia mathee wa kibandaski  apee mapaka wa mtaa  as charity from you, hehe. 
4. Kama comrade umetulia kejani na huna snacks, do ivi chukua maji weka kapinch ya salt ukunywe uskie greatness imerudi ASAP 
5. Njugu. Njugu ye comrade.  Peanut ama groundnutsziwe constantly kwa keja. 
6. Avoid tea/coffee na mandazi ama chapati; iyo menu issano 👎 👎 


Kumaliza njaa na weakness a comrade needs: 
1. Blueband ama any source of fat yenye unaijua ata kma ni ile mafuta ya  wamasai ya kondoo, bora ni fats
2. Salt - piga pinches kwa maji kijana, hapa hakuna kitu kama ukikuka chumvi nyingi utazeeka. No fucking way. Wahenga walisema hii shiet ku gatekeep hii info.
3. Nuts - na sio izo vitu unataka kufkiria bro, im not advocating for LGtv+, naongelea peanuts ama groundnuts. Nunua ata kama ni zile hazija roastiwa ujipange nazo comrade 

Thats all for today's comradery class. 🥂

It's not one of anguish or anger. It's a jovial smile. The kind where the joke is on the living, and they hadn't just realized it yet. That they were the butt of it. Not until they see the turned-up lips of death's smile, do they realize they are the ones being laughed at. 

I was awoken to the ringing of my phone. In the past, I had always done the status quo. So after spelunking for a while, I got my official caving license. It seemed like the normal thing to do, although I never considered myself a true caver at heart. Calling myself a professional was out of the question. 

Yet, the call still rang. At the time, I wasn't aware who the caller was. if I'd known, I wonder if I would've picked up.  It was just someone's unknown number, so I had thought it was a wrong number, and I said that in my sleepy greeting. But the urgency of the caller's voice woke me up instantly. 

A newly discovered cave lay unexplored in the farmland of Tennessee. Stacy Winfry, a fifty-two-year-old woman, had fallen into a sinkhole nearby. The ground collapsed beneath her feet as she was taking photos of a few asphodel flowers that only surrounded a lonely cave. She was with her husband Richard at the time. Those two were a notorious caving duo, famous for thousands of photos taken inside the world's deadliest caves. This was supposed to be their last mission together before they retired from caving completely. 

What a cruel joke. 

I knew all too well that this was probably more of a body recovery mission than a rescue, but it was still being treated as a rescue. Nobody probably wanted to admit it. That she was dead. 

No one could get close to the edge of the sinkhole without the earth collapsing even more. So the only plan first responders could think of was to send a few people into the cave to see if they could find the bottom of the hole. I was one out of five with enough experience and close enough to get there in good time. 

I have been caving for years and usually wouldn't feel this nervous going in. The reason I was even in Tennessee was to see the lost sea inside Craighead's cavern. A well-traveled spot I hadn't been to yet, just because of how far it was from home. It was something I wanted to see with my own eyes. The lost sea, the largest underground body of water that humankind has discovered. I didn’t get into caving for the fun of it, it sort of found me. I consider myself a hobbyist at most. I am not a very physical person either. Most would describe me as the scrawny nerd type. 

So I had no idea why I was chosen. If I had any sort of reputation among cavers, it was the quiet guy who had struggles keeping up with the others. I have never been on a rescue, since I have never been asked to help that way before. My experience in new parts is limited, probably due other’s lack of interest in letting me tag along on their trips. (Depending on the goal of the para

There were four others the first responder’s had asked and they already agreed to help. So if I said no, I would be the only one. I didn't know who was on the team yet exactly. But word tends to spread, especially in a hobby like caving. I didn't want to deal with rumors when I already had issues finding people who I enjoyed caving with. I didn't want to lose this community either. They were the only people I spoke to these days. 

So against my better judgment I also agreed. Even though I knew this decision was stupid, I would be the weakest link. Although with rescues like this, the more people involved meant there was safety in numbers and a greater chance at success. So I could easily tell myself I was needed and wouldn’t drag anyone down. 

I got dressed and packed up my supplies. I checked out of the shitty motel in Sweet Water. I was heading towards Athens. Although the destination would be a cattle ranch vaguely between both cities, it wasn't exactly on the route. 

The hills and green land blurred into each other with every turn. A part of me wished I would lose signal and get lost in the back roads somewhere. But the last turn came abruptly as a long gravel driveway took me to the farmland where the cave was. A long line of emergency vehicles was parked outside, their lights still flashing blue and red. But no one was there. So the only noise was the turning of rocks beneath the car's tires. 

A lonely man sat quietly on his porch. His hands take a shaky drag from his cigarette. As I approached his house he stood up. 

I introduced myself, “Hello, I am Ryan Jesterlyn. I am here for the rescue. I’m one of the cavers.”

The older man gave a nod. “A lot of you folk have been coming back and forth this way.” 

He wobbled off the front porch and started to walk down a path that led behind his home. I stayed silent assuming I should follow him. I awkwardly tried to come up with something to say, but he spoke up first. 

“I was excited at first…finding that cave on my property. It's been me and the cows for a good while now. I thought it would bring people.” The homeowner said. 

“How did you find it?” I asked. 

I was a bit of curiosity how a cave could have gone unnoticed on land frequently used. Although, again I didn’t have to say anything. 

“I saw one of the calves stuck between two boulders. After getting it unstuck I saw that it was deeper than just that. Ya'know cows are always getting stuck in weird spots.” He answered. 

I didn't know but nodded. He walked a bit slowly through the farmland. It wasn't his fault, his whole body trembled with each step. I couldn’t tell if it was him being older or from the stress of the events from earlier that morning. He opened up a gate to a field overgrown with flowers and tall grass. 

Slowly I could see more people on the scene. One or two passed us walking back from where we came. A bigger group closer to the site were taking a smoke break. Probably discussing the rescue. 

“I wish I didn't call or it was one of mine instead.” The farmer said. “The cows are all I have left yet…yet… It's so terrible that it's someone. She seemed really nice.” 

I heard the guilt held within his voice. I felt bad for him, that was for sure. Nature took its turn and played a nasty trick, and he wasn't the one to blame for it. The other first responders probably had already told him that. I knew those thoughts well and they couldn’t be changed by a few words. I knew anything I could tell him wouldn’t change his feelings in the slightest. Whatever happened today would gnaw on our skulls for a very long time. \* 

“Can you save her?” He asked. 

“I'll do my best,”  was my reply. 

His question startled me. I wasn't about to become full of empty promises for temporary comfort. He nodded again before shuffling back to his house.

I scanned the group of first responders while walking closer awkwardly. I didn't know who was in charge or where to go exactly. Caution tape surrounded the large hole in the ground. Even from a distance I could sense its depth. There was a small creek flowing quietly. Just beyond that a few boulders stacked against each other that matched up the farmer's description. In the crook of them also seemed another much smaller hole in the earth. Which would have definitely been hidden by the tall grass if it wasn't trampled and cut already. 

An arm swung around my shoulder. “Ryan! It's great to see you here.” 

I felt two kinds of relief at once. I already knew someone who was coming on the mission, Noah Leigh. He was a good guy and I don't say that much. But the other relief I felt is that I had agreed to do this. If I had said no it wouldn't just have strangers I was letting down. He was the reason I was even here in the first place. 

“Its great to see you too.” I said. 

“Well once we're in we can catch up a bit, let me bring you to the others,” Noah said. 

Noah was smiling like his usual self. Dirt already covered his freshly shaved face. His blonde hair blended into the sunlight as I followed him. I squinted because it was too bright and he was too cheerful for this morning. Especially when the weather channel forecaster said it would rain today.

 The group of the three other cavers stood out from the rest. They were geared up and their attitudes were of determination rather than the worried looks others on the scene gave. They seemed deep in discussion. Richard Winfry was the focus of it. I could recognize his appearance from the magazines. His overgrown white beard and overalls made him look like he belonged more at the farm than the actual owner. 

 

“It's okay to stay out of this one. It would be a lot to handle.” The only woman of the group said. 

She had long dark brown hair and eyes to match. She was pretty petite as well. So she was an important member of the team, being able to go where us bulkier men couldn't. I wondered why she was the only woman aboard this mission. It would be better if everyone here was as short as her. I guess I half counted. I wasn't that tall either. 

“I'm going in.” Richard's voice was firm. 

“Well I think it's a good idea,” the last man of the group said. He sounded full of it and he looked the part too. He was tall, fit, and handsome. Seemed to be from head to toe in name brand gear. “We need his experience.” 

Richard ignored the two and walked over to us. The handsome man who I hadn’t gotten the name of yet, beamed with excitement. Probably from the opportunity to cave with Mr. Winfry. The woman just rolled her eyes at him. 

“My name is Richard Winfry,” the man with no introductions necessary said. “Thanks for coming out today. We could really use any help on this rescue.”

Richard shook my hand. I assumed he already had met Noah before I had arrived. Since he didn’t shake his after mine.  

“Its no problem at all, we are glad to be able to help.” Noah said. I nodded to look like I was agreeing with my friend. 

Richard nodded approvingly. “That one there is Nathan Shields, the short one is Kimberly Heathren. Looks like you already know Noah”  

Richard pointed at them without looking back. Kimberly waved and Nathan gave a smug stare. I waved back awkwardly. Nathan scoffed while Kimberly smiled politely. 

“Yeah, thanks. I do know him. My name is Ryan Jesterlyn.” I said. I felt like a fool with the way my words came out. 

“There isn't much of a plan. But just going in and seeing if we can find her. “ Richard said. Instantly changing the subject away from introductions. 

So the plan was the just the good old ‘go fuck around and find out’. I knew it was going to be like this but somehow I still felt uneasy by the thought. Richard left us to continue his efforts by double checking our supplies. 

Soon enough we made it to the cave entrance, it was a hole just big enough for a person to squeeze through. There were tall white flowers littering the ground by the cave. None of the first responders went past the creek. A visible border for those of us willing to risk death I suppose. 

“I hope we can save her and come out of this as heroes,” Noah whispered into my ear with excitement. 

Noah had been a hero for a while. He was too dense to have realized. I didn't reply and he elbowed me. I just nodded back. I could never be seen as a hero even if we returned with Stacy alive. 

Kimberly was going to be the first one to go in. Since she was the smallest it would be the easiest for her to get in and out. I watched her say goodbye to her mother. Her mom hugged her and tied a red scarf around her daughter's neck more snugly, before saying goodbye. My mouth went dry seeing that. 

She went in pretty easily.  We could hear the rolling of a few rocks. But she shouted from below that she was fine and it was safe. We went in one after the other. I was the last in. A stream of water connected to the one outside, also followed us down as we skidded across the gravel. Once at the bottom I heard the howling and barking of three dogs. There weren't any I saw earlier so they must have just arrived. Another pointless venture in the rescue. 

The first chamber wasn't too huge. But we weren't uncomfortable standing there. The small stream led down a tunnel wide enough for two of us to walk side by side. It seemed pretty steep, as it was going deeper into the earth. It seemed that to make any progress forwards towards the sinkhole, the deeper we had to go. Stacy wasn’t here of course. We assumed she landed somewhere else inside of the cave. But a part of us all hoped it was that easy. I knew I was disappointed in figuring out that we probably had to go far inside. 

The cave walls were the color of sand. They bent and curved in an alien type shape. There was no moss growing on the sides of the cave. Despite it looking pretty damp. The ground wasn't entirely flat either, it almost looked like water permanently stuck in movement. Using my flash light to follow it, there were stripes of a redder brown rock flowing through it. 

Kimberly had already set up a safety line. It was a bright orange so we could easily see it to follow our way back. It was tied to a stalagmite. Scanning with our lights we made our way carefully. 

“I promise we'll find her.” Kimberly said to Richard. She was walking next to him while taking the lead. 

“Don't worry Robbie, we all promise to find her together.” Noah said cheerfully. 

Noah was walking right next to me and Nathan walked behind us. He self proclaimed himself as the next best experienced. Which was true, I had heard his name mentioned a few times for being an upcoming talent within spelunking. He took the rear just in case something happened from behind. 

“Don't call me that ever again,” Mr Winfry said. 

Noah elbowed me. Probably to egg me on to make a fake promise as well. 

“I promise to do my best to find her.” Nathan said. He was brimming with confidence. 

“Me too..” I said quickly.

 Richard just sighed and continued in silence. For the entrance zone of this cave and for the outside to be brimming with life there were no small critters or fauna to be found. It was utterly lifeless in an environment that many creatures could call home.

I looked at Noah a few times. We have caved together enough for him to know that meant I had something to say to him. Even in the dimmed light I could sense his eyebrows raised with curiosity. 

“I’m kind of nervous.” I said quietly so hopefully only he would hear me. “I haven't done a rescue before like this.” 

“I'm here with you. “ Noah said, patting my shoulder. I heard the loudest whiniest sigh from behind me. 

“So who's bright idea was it to bring the newb?” Nathan asked. 

I didn't think he was necessarily wrong for having a concern. But the way he said it made me feel even more awkward. I was already growing to dislike him. 

“Don't be so rude. He isn't, we do tons of caving stuff together.” Noah instantly came to my defense like a dog would defend its master. Nathan scoffed like he was about to make a retort. 

“Shut up and focus.” Richard said.

 We continued in silence yet again. We came across our first fork in the road. The tunnel we were in split apart into two separate directions. 

“I'll take Noah and Ryan down this way. Kimberly and Nathan will go that way” Richard pointed down a tunnel towards the left where the little stream continued down for us to follow him. 

While he pointed towards the tunnel on the right for Nathan and Kimberly to go down. Kimberly gave a thumbs up. She connected another rope to the one we were already using and she handed the original one to Richard. 

“See you guys later then,” Kimberly said. 

Nathan smiled and gave a casual salute paired with a wave. Before following Kimberly into the darkness. I was glad to see him go. Some of my anxiousness would wear off with him out of sight. Richard was already a few paces ahead of us. Our helmet head lamps and flash lights still provided enough light so there was enough visibility still. 

“After all this we should all get Denny's"" Noah said. “I know I'll be famished.” 

“Sure why not.” I replied. 

Noah was just trying to keep a good mood during this stressful caving rescue. He only ever offered to eat out after he was feeling that way about a cave. Seldom happened, but was something I picked up on long ago.  

“I could really go for cheap pancakes right now.” Noah said. 

“Or another cup of coffee.” I replied. 

“Dude, look at your eye bags. Any more caffeine and I fear you'll stay up until you hear God or some shit,” Noah said before stumbling a bit on the unsteady ground. I grabbed his arm and pulled him back so he wouldn't crash into Richard.  

“Oops-” before Noah could even properly apologize Richard shot him a glare.

“Let's be quiet now.” Richard said. 

We both stayed quiet after that. Noah gave me a guilty look. He wasn't very good at reading the room but he always had good intentions. I could see Richard's irritation  with his attitude. I was the same way when I first met Noah. While I couldn't imagine how Richard was feeling and thinking right now, I was in a pretty dark spot as well when I first met him. Maybe Noah's tenacity will eventually cheer up Mr. Winfry like it had for me. 

We entered the second chamber. Something was wrong with the stalactites; they were all too uniformed hanging from the ceiling. But I didn't have time to fully take a look. We suddenly could hear the panicked voices of Nathan and Kimberly echoing through the chamber and all of us rushed over towards the noise.

Kimberly was in the new chamber with us, apparently both tunnels connected back together again. On the other hand Nathan was stuck half way between the tunnel and chamber. The tunnel had gotten more narrow the closer to the end it got. Only Kimberly could slip through easily. Now the entrance Kimberly came through was a Nathan and rock sandwich. 

“I knew your fat ass wouldn't fit. “ Kimberly complained. “I told you to turn around and meet up again with the others, idiot.”

She pointed back at us, which happened to land on me. The look Nathan gave me because of it, made my skin crawl. I already could tell that he didn’t like me that much. The added bonus of his embarrassment sure didn’t help. Kimberly insisted Noah and I each grab a limb and pull to dislodge him. 

I felt unsettled in this part of the cave. It wasn't just the newness of rescue or normal cave jitters anymore. I could tell out of my corner of my eye and with the limited light something looked so off. It was all too smooth, the stalactites I mean. I grabbed Nathan's leg and Noah grabbed his arm. 

Richard stood off to the side impatiently.  Although his eyes remained on us. Like he was there just in case one of us tripped. Kimberly could be louder than I thought as she counted to help us time when to pull. I felt like we barely managed to pull him out. Nathan gave a barely noticeable thanks, but Noah was already saying no problem to Nathan's ignorance.

Finally with no one in immediate danger we could finally look where the cave took us. Stalactites covered the ceiling. At least, that's what they looked like at first. They were either oddly round or square. Eventually a few in even more bizarre shapes like crosses and angels came into view of my flashlight. The stalactites weren't any sort of natural forming ones. They were gravestones jutting from the ceiling of the cave in a faux display of stalactites. 

This didn't make any sense. Upon quick glance they even had names and dates. But there was no possible way we were the first ever humans in this cave. 

“I’m not the only one seeing things?"" Kimberly asked the first to break the silence.

 We all exploded into conversation after that. It wasn't like we were even really speaking to each other but more of echoing each other's shocked statements. I personally, was muttering what the fuck under my breath. That's until my flashlight landed on one certain grave. I went silent. 

*Abel Jesterlyn Jan.23 1992 - August 2nd 2019* 

It was my brother's grave. What the fuck. I couldn't let the others see this. Did they somehow know and this was a bad prank? I would deserve the humiliation if true. I stumbled the furthest away I could from that particular grave. 

I was hoping for a cheerful word from Noah. Some way to turn the situation brighter than what it was. But Noah didn't crack any. 

“Let's go.” Noah sounded terrified. 

“We will keep going in. “ Richard said. “It's obvious the land owners had at least been this far in. So it should be safe to continue.” 

Noah looked to me like I was somehow supposed to object. I shrugged at him trying to make it seem like I didn't just see a replica of my brother's grave. I knew it couldn’t have been the old man I had met earlier. I wasn't going to say it out loud either, any possibility for the graves seemed illogical. 

“We'll stick together from how on.” Richard said. 

“Let's just follow the stream, it should be heading somewhere, right?” Nathan asked. 

Nathan was one of the only ones not disturbed by our findings. He probably checked the exits and our surroundings in better detail. While we were busy exploring the oddity and letting it get to our heads. I at least could praise him for being level headed. Even if I already found other aspects of his personality annoying. 

 “I checked there are three other exits to this chamber but two seem to be dead ends.” Nathan said. 

Nathan shouldn't have gone on without us. Being alone in a cave is dangerous. Although none of us complained. It meant we didn't have to waste our time and have to turn around back to this chamber.

Richard led us deeper into the cave. 

We were now in the twilight zone. I could hear the rushing of a bigger stream of water up ahead. Each step took us closer towards it. We would probably find the end of the little stream pretty soon if we kept on in our journey. ",2,1763550202.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

1p14lzy,https://i.redd.it/50jffneh372g1.jpeg,Eyes to See God’s People,"“Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.” (Galatians 6:2)

Reflection
We live in a world that trains us to look down at screens or straight ahead at our own schedules, rarely up and into the faces around us. Yet Jesus was different. He saw people.
•  He saw Zacchaeus hidden in a tree and called him by name.
•  He saw the woman pressing through the crowd, trembling with sickness, and felt power go out from Him before she even spoke.
•  He saw Peter sinking in the waves and reached before Peter could cry for help.

That kind of seeing isn’t casual glancing; it’s sacred noticing. It’s choosing to look long enough to recognize the image of God in someone else, even when they feel invisible, even when they’re hard to love.

Carrying another’s burden doesn’t always mean solving their problem. Sometimes it simply means refusing to look away. A text that says “I’ve been praying for you” can feel like someone grabbing the other end of a stretcher you thought you had to carry alone. A quiet “How are you, really?” can be the moment the Holy Spirit slips in and begins healing what words never could.

Today, ask for borrowed eyes, Jesus’ eyes. Ask Him to slow your scroll, interrupt your hurry, and highlight one person whose heart is heavier than they’re letting on. Then obey the nudge.

Action Step
Reach out to one person today with intentional encouragement.
•  Send a voice note that says you’re proud of them.
•  Call just to listen, not to fix.
•  Text a specific prayer over something they’re facing.
•  Drop off coffee or a handwritten note if you’re near.

Let it cost you five unhurried minutes. That’s often all the Spirit needs to do something eternal.

Closing Prayer
Father,
Open my eyes today the way You opened Elisha’s servant’s eyes to see the hills full of horses and chariots of fire. Help me notice the people You’ve already surrounded with Your presence, even when they feel alone. Give me courage to step into someone’s story with gentleness and truth. Soften my heart where it’s grown calloused, and fill my words with the same kindness that drew broken people to Jesus. Use something as small as my voice or my thumbs on a screen to remind someone they are seen, known, and fiercely loved by You.
In the name of Jesus, who never looked away,
Amen.

Go. Someone’s name is already rising in your heart. Don’t overthink it; just reach.",2,1763549970.0,BibleVerseCommentary,1,1.0,False

1p14knd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1p14knd/best_travel_garment_bags/,Best Travel Garment Bags,"The Best Travel Garment Bags That Actually Keep Your Clothes Looking Sharp

My first destination wedding as a groomsman, I confidently rolled my rental tux into my carry-on using some YouTube hack. Arrived in Mexico, unzipped my bag, and found what looked like someone had wadded up my suit and used it to mop a floor. I spent an hour in the hotel bathroom running a hot shower, desperately trying to steam out creases while my friend pounded on the door asking if I was okay.

That embarrassment cost me $65 in hotel dry cleaning charges and taught me something important: if you travel with formal wear more than once a year, you need a real garment bag.

But here's the thing nobody tells you—traditional garment bags are awkward as hell to travel with. They're basically fabric body bags for clothes that don't fit anywhere and make you look like you're smuggling a corpse through TSA.

The good news? The garment bag has evolved. After ruining three more suits and testing probably a dozen different bags over the past few years of work trips and weddings, I've figured out which ones actually deliver wrinkle-free clothes without making you feel like a traveling salesman from 1987.

# What I Learned About Garment Bags (The Stuff Nobody Mentions)

Before we dive into specific bags, here's what actually matters:

**Convertible beats traditional every time.** Those old-school hanging garment bags? They count as your carry-on, leaving you juggling a personal item and looking ridiculous. The 2-in-1 convertible garment duffels that zip up into normal-looking bags changed everything.

**The fold matters more than the material.** I thought expensive fabric would prevent wrinkles. Nope. What matters is how many times your clothes fold and how tightly they're secured. A $60 bag with good compression straps beats a $200 bag that lets everything shift around.

**Shoe compartments are non-negotiable.** Unless you're cool with dress shoes touching your collar. I learned this when I opened my bag at a conference and found my Oxford's dusty sole print on my white dress shirt.

Here's what worked—and what definitely didn't.



# 1. Halfday Garment Duffel 45L – The One That Converted Me

**Price:** $98-$178 (Premium version)

This bag is the reason I stopped checking luggage for work trips.

I bought the original Halfday for $98 after seeing it everywhere on Instagram, fully expecting it to be overhyped garbage. Instead, it completely changed how I pack. It's a garment bag that zips up into a duffel, holds a full suit plus 3-4 days of regular clothes, and actually fits in overhead bins.

**What makes it work:** The garment section hangs your suit jacket and dress shirts, then the whole thing zips into a compact duffel shape. Two interior shoe pockets (each fits a men's size 13), a trolley sleeve that slides over your suitcase handle, and enough room in the main section for folded clothes, toiletries, and your laptop.

I've taken this on five-day trips to Paris and Seoul. Packed a suit, dress shirts, casual clothes, gym stuff, and still had room. The thing that surprised me most? My suit genuinely looked fresh when I unpacked it. The key is how the clothes hang flat in the garment section—there's only one fold in the middle, which steams out in minutes.

**The downside:** The original version's polyester looks a bit cheap—like a high school gym bag. After two years of use, mine's showing wear on the corners. That's why they released the Premium version ($178) with ballistic nylon, reinforced handles, and a padded laptop sleeve. I upgraded and it's noticeably more durable.

**Best for:** Anyone who travels for work regularly and wants one bag that does everything. If you're going to buy one garment bag and actually use it, this is it.



# 2. Away Garment Bag – The Minimalist's Choice

**Price:** $155 (currently on sale)

Away's garment bag feels like it was designed by someone who actually travels.

Unlike most garment bags that try to do everything, this one does one thing extremely well: it keeps formal wear wrinkle-free while taking up minimal space. It clips inside Away's Bigger Carry-On, which is genius if you already own their suitcase. But it also works perfectly as a standalone piece.

**What I love:** Water-resistant nylon, two shoe compartments, two zippered pockets for accessories, and it opens vertically so you're not wrestling with it in airport bathrooms. The internal structure uses tiered loops that fit multiple hangers, keeping everything separated and secure.

During CNN's testing, they shook it, dropped it hard, and basically abused it—clothes stayed wrinkle-free. I've had similar results. Took it to a wedding in Charleston, hung my suit and two dress shirts, and everything looked perfect when I arrived.

**The catch:** It's specifically designed for Away's Bigger Carry-On. If you don't have that suitcase, you lose the clever clip-in feature. Also, it's smaller than convertible duffels—holds 2-3 suits max, but no room for casual clothes. You'll need a separate bag for everything else.

**Best for:** Minimalists who want a dedicated garment sleeve that doesn't try to be a duffel. Perfect for destination weddings where you're bringing one suit and packing light.



# 3. Tumi Alpha 3 Tri-Fold Carry-On – When Money Isn't the Issue

**Price:** $795

Let's address the elephant: this bag costs as much as a round-trip flight to Europe.

But I've watched colleagues use the same Tumi for 5+ years while I've replaced cheaper bags three times. The math starts making sense when you factor in longevity. This is the garment bag version of buying a $400 leather jacket that lasts twenty years instead of five $80 ones.

**Why it's expensive:** FXT ballistic nylon (Tumi's proprietary fabric that's virtually indestructible), padded roll bars that eliminate wrinkles, TSA-approved lock, multiple compression straps, and their Tracer program that helps recover lost luggage. The tri-fold design holds two full suits, has a removable toiletry bag, and features a hanging hook that actually supports weight.

I borrowed my boss's for a week-long conference series. The build quality is immediately obvious—zippers glide like butter, handles are perfectly balanced, every detail feels premium. My suits looked immaculate after five flights. But the real test was durability. His bag looked brand new after four years of weekly travel. Mine from Amazon looked beaten after four months.

**The reality check:** Unless you're a consultant flying 50+ times a year, you probably don't need this. But if you are that person? The investment makes sense. Tumi's warranty covers airline damage, which alone might justify the cost after a few rough baggage handlers destroy cheaper options.

**Best for:** Frequent business travelers with expense accounts or anyone who values buy-it-for-life quality over saving money upfront.



# 4. Amazon Basics Tri-Fold Garment Bag – The Budget Champion

**Price:** $32-$45

Sometimes the cheapest option is actually... fine.

I bought this for a one-off event, expecting it to be trash that I'd toss after. Two years later, I still use it for quick overnight trips when I don't want to risk my nicer bags. It's shockingly functional for the price.

**What works:** Holds three suits or dresses, has mesh zipper pockets inside, tie-down straps to prevent wrinkles, an organizer pocket in front for phone/passport, and includes a padded shoulder strap. Made from 1680D polyester, which is surprisingly durable.

**What doesn't:** Everything feels slightly cheap—zippers stick occasionally, the shoulder strap isn't padded enough for extended carrying, and after a year the fabric started showing wear. But for $40? I expected worse. Much worse.

Pack Hacker and multiple reviewers say the same thing: it's a solid backup bag. Take it to a wedding, use it for quarterly work trips, or keep it as your spare. When I spilled coffee on my Halfday before a flight, this Amazon bag saved my ass. My suit arrived wrinkle-free and I was out less than $50.

**The honest assessment:** This won't last five years. But it'll last long enough to make the $40 worth it. If you travel with a suit 2-3 times a year max, why spend $200? Get this, treat it reasonably, and replace it when it breaks.

**Best for:** Occasional travelers, backup bags, or anyone testing whether they actually need a garment bag before investing serious money.



# 5. Briggs & Riley Baseline Garment Duffle – The Overlooked Gem

**Price:** $329

This bag doesn't get the Instagram hype of Halfday or the brand recognition of Away, but talk to actual business travelers and they'll mention Briggs & Riley.

**What makes it special:** Ballistic nylon construction, converts from garment bag to duffel, holds two suits, includes a shoe pocket, and comes with Briggs & Riley's legendary warranty—they repair ANY damage, even from airlines, for life. No questions asked.

I've used it for six months of monthly work trips. It's more refined than Halfday (doesn't look like a gym bag), more practical than Away (room for non-formal clothes), and more affordable than Tumi while feeling equally well-made.

**The professional edge:** The design is understated. No flashy logos, just clean lines and black fabric. At airports, it blends in. At client meetings, it looks expensive without screaming ""I spent $300 on a bag."" The compression straps keep everything in place, and the duffel section is genuinely spacious—I've packed four days of clothes plus a suit.

**What could be better:** No laptop compartment. For a $329 bag aimed at business travelers, that's bizarre. I work around it with a laptop sleeve, but it's annoying. Also heavier than Halfday—you feel the extra weight after walking through O'Hare.

**Best for:** Business travelers who want something more refined than Halfday but can't justify Tumi prices. The lifetime warranty alone adds massive value.



# 6. Modoker/Seyfocnia Rolling Garment Duffel – The TikTok Surprise

**Price:** $60-$80

These Chinese brands went viral on TikTok for looking expensive while costing nothing, and honestly... they're not bad.

I was skeptical—usually viral Amazon finds are garbage with fake reviews. But curiosity got me, and for $70, I figured it was worth the risk. The bag showed up looking way better than expected. Faux leather accents, smooth zippers, structured design, convertible functionality similar to much pricier options.

**What's impressive:** Holds multiple garments, has shoe compartments, includes a toiletry bag, and even has a laptop sleeve. The garment section uses compression straps and hangs flat. I took it on a three-day work trip and my suit looked fine. Not perfect, but fine.

**The catches:** Quality control is inconsistent—read reviews and some people got great bags, others got ones with zipper issues. Customer service is basically nonexistent. And while it looks expensive, up close you can tell it's not. The ""leather"" is obviously vinyl, zippers are smooth but not premium, stitching is functional but not refined.

**The verdict:** For $70, it's a gamble that might pay off. Mine has held up for six months, but I've seen Reddit posts about them falling apart after a few trips. If you're on a tight budget and need something nicer-looking than Amazon Basics, roll the dice. Just don't expect it to last years.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious travelers willing to risk quality control issues for the chance at a bag that looks way pricier than it is.



# What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

After buying more garment bags than any reasonable person should own, here's what actually matters:

**Convertible beats traditional.** Unless you only ever use it for car trips, get a bag that converts to a duffel. The flexibility is worth everything.

**Compression straps are the real MVP.** They matter more than price or brand. If your clothes shift around during travel, you're getting wrinkles. Good straps prevent that.

**Water resistance saves your ass.** Eventually you'll get caught in rain, spill something, or encounter a random airport leak. Water-resistant fabric has saved my clothes multiple times.

**Shoe compartments prevent disasters.** Dirty shoes touching clean clothes is a special kind of travel hell. Get a bag with dedicated shoe storage.

For most people, the Halfday Garment Duffel ($98) hits the sweet spot. It's affordable enough to not stress about, well-made enough to last a few years, and genuinely functional. If you want something nicer, Briggs & Riley ($329) gives you premium quality without the Tumi price tag.

But honestly? Start with something cheap like Amazon Basics. Use it for a few trips. Figure out what annoys you. Then upgrade to something better that fixes those specific issues.

What's your experience with garment bags? Found one that actually works? Or have a horror story about arriving with a suit that looked like origami? I'm always curious what works for other travelers.",1,1763549862.0,PackAndGo,0,1.0,False

My place gets a weird mix of weather. It’s sunny most of the day, but in the evenings there’s usually a bit of humidity, and every once in a while we get these random windy days that blow dust everywhere. I don’t have a covered balcony, so anything I put out there is basically fully exposed.

The thing is, I really want to make the space usable. I work from home a lot, and it would be nice to have a little seating area where I can drink coffee or read without feeling like I’m sitting on a plastic lawn chair from the early 2000s. The rattan style fits perfectly with the vibe I want, but I don’t want to spend money on something that will fade, crack, or basically fall apart after a single season.

If you’ve owned rattan chairs outside, especially in sunny or dusty environments, how long did they last? Are there specific types that are more durable? I’m also wondering if I should stick to faux rattan instead. Any real world experience helps.",1,1763549550.0,HomeGear,0,1.0,False

When the sun steps in

What do you speak

When your thoughts begin

Was it the smile you saw

The words that you hear

The hand in your brow

That finally sets in

Was it the paper on the table

Carrying the news

The show aired by cable

With popular reviews

Was it the fresh aroma

That the coffee brings

The sizzle in the pan

That makes your heart sing

Was it the little steps

That sounds familiar

The growing yelps

Around the corner

Was it the drops of rain

That veiled the sun

Kissing the flowers prim

As the daylight run

Was it the gentle hand

That rests upon your shoulder

Lightly lifting the stray strand

As you held her, a little closer

A symphony of pops and creaks erupts from your body. Sound familiar? Hitting 45 is a *thing*, isn't it? Suddenly, our joints seem to have a mind of their own. But don't resign yourself to a life of ibuprofen and gentle sighs just yet!

Retirement body bliss IS possible, and it might be closer than you think. Let’s talk Yoga vs. Pilates:

*   **Yoga:** Think *long* and *lean*. It's all about stretching, holding poses, and connecting with your inner zen… which can be seriously beneficial when your kids are testing your last nerve. Plus, all that flexibility can make those everyday movements (like, say, getting out of bed) a whole lot smoother.

*   **Pilates:** Picture building a *strong core*. We’re talking abs of steel… okay, maybe not *steel*, but definitely stronger than they are now! Pilates focuses on controlled movements that build strength and stability. This is a game-changer for posture and preventing injuries. Think of it as an internal scaffolding that keeps you upright and ready to tackle anything.

So, which one reigns supreme? Well, the truth is...it depends!

*   **Joint Pain Central?** Pilates might be your MVP. The controlled movements and focus on core strength can provide amazing support and alleviate pressure on those aching joints.

*   **Stress City?** Yoga could be your escape. The breathing exercises and focus on mindfulness can help calm your nervous system and melt away tension.

*   **Need a little bit of everything?** Why not both?! Seriously, consider incorporating elements of both into your routine.

It’s about finding what works for *you* and what you actually enjoy. After all, the best exercise is the one you’ll *actually* do, right?

Ever wondered if you’re on track for that retirement bliss? Speaking of feeling good and secure, **""You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.""** https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb

Just remember: consistency is key! Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a HUGE difference. So, roll out that mat (or power up that Pilates app) and start feeling amazing, one creak-free movement at a time.
Life's too short to be limited by stiff joints, here’s to feeling good now and for all the years to come!

There’s so much noise online about how EVs are “expensive” but most of that comes from people who’ve never actually owned one.

Last night I charged my Mustang Mach-E P for six hours and got up to 90%. The total cost was $1.59 and when you see that on your bill it’s hard to take the whole “EVs cost more to run” thing seriously.

A lot of the negativity around EVs feels like it comes from media clips or politics or just assumptions that don’t apply to actual EV owners. Most of us aren’t relying on overpriced public chargers every day. We plug in at home or in my case at my condo where it’s about 25 cents an hour after 9 PM which is cheaper than most people’s morning coffee.

I get that older condos or certain homes might need upgrades and that can be a hurdle but for anyone moving into a newer building or planning ahead looking for a place with EV chargers is honestly a game changer. The savings add up way faster than people realize.

At this point with how little I pay each month I can’t imagine going back to gas. Not because gas cars are bad but because the math just doesn’t make sense for me anymore.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Chapter 1

After the divorce, I left Las Vegas without a moment's hesitation.

I headed to Dubai alone, ready to start anew.

Over time, I carved out a name for myself in the shadowy world of Middle Eastern arms dealing.

Then, whispers from Las Vegas reached me: my ex-husband, Augustine Clayton, was about to get engaged to his little mistress.

I ran my fingers over the bullet pendant around my neck.

Eight years ago, during a brutal gang shootout, he'd taken that bullet for me. It had grazed perilously close to his heart, missing by a hair's breadth.

Once the surgeons pulled it out, he fashioned it into a necklace and slipped it around my neck.

His voice was soft, almost tender, as he whispered, ""From now on, my life is yours.""

Snapping back to the present, I yanked the chain off without a second thought and tossed it into the trash.

Back then, everyone sneered that I was just some prize Augustine had won at the casino tables—that without him, I'd be nothing.

Seven years later, I returned to Las Vegas to open a new mine.

At the negotiation table, Augustine, who ruled half the city, locked eyes with me, and in that instant, tears welled up in his eyes.

I, however, remembered what had happened at his father's funeral seven years earlier.

That day, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his mistress, letting her play the part of his wife, graciously accepting condolences from family and friends.

That day, I learned my husband had built a cozy little home with her in Centennial Hills.

I slid the divorce papers across the table to Augustine, calm and collected as ever.

""Sign them.""

Augustine arched an eyebrow, his expression dripping with amusement.

Tucked beneath the agreement was a newspaper, sensationalized to the hilt, detailing how Augustine's lover, Cecilia Webster, had stolen the spotlight at the funeral, leaving his real wife humiliated and sidelined.

""Kassandra, must you play these childish games again?"" he asked casually.

""For eight years, you've dangled divorce over my head like a threat—must be at least a hundred times by now. Haven't you gotten tired of this routine?""

Then he fished a black card out of his pocket and flicked it onto the table.

""If that's not enough, just hit up Brad—he'll wire you more. I've been swamped with work lately, but you can call me if you need anything.""

I didn't take the card. I simply cast a cool glance at Cecilia in his arms.

All the women Augustine had paraded around these years looked just like her.

I knew exactly why Augustine never married Cecilia after she came back.

After all, the wife of the underground king wasn't meant for the one he loved—it was for the one who fit the role, the strategic choice.

""You planning to keep her as your side piece forever?""

I nudged the divorce papers forward again.

Cecilia pouted in annoyance, clearly stung by the ""side piece"" label. She cooed in that saccharine voice of hers, ""Ms. Lambert, love's between two people. The one who's not loved is the real side piece.""

Augustine chuckled lightly, saying nothing to contradict her.

He stroked her cheek affectionately, then turned to me. ""We'll go to the church tomorrow morning. Don't be late.""

I didn't look away until his figure faded.

Every week, Augustine dragged me to church, saying it would cleanse us of our sins.

His mother, Shelly Clayton, often hinted that my barren womb was proof of my sin.

And Augustine? He saw my intolerance for his mistresses as the sin of jealousy.

Stepping into the church, I closed my eyes and began to pray.

When Augustine arrived, an inexplicable wave of panic gripped my heart.

""Kassandra,"" he called out.

My pulse quickened, a knot tightening in my chest.

""A sorcerer told me Cecilia's in for some bad luck this year. The only way to ward it off is to soak her feet in water mixed with your father's ashes.""

I shot to my feet, staring into his cold, impassive eyes in utter shock—then burst into a hollow laugh.

""Augustine, eight years ago, I consulted a fortune teller about us. I lied and said we were a perfect match, but the truth? He told me you will ruin my life, and we will never have a baby.

""If you so much as touch my father's grave, I'll smash your father's coffin to splinters.""

Over the years, I'd cried and raged over his endless affairs.

I'd learned the hard way: in this cutthroat jungle, no man respected a woman who endured everything without fighting back.

His face darkened in an instant.

""Do it!"" he ordered, his voice stern, brooking no dissent.

""Augustine!""

His henchmen pinned me down with iron grips, while the others desecrated my father's grave right before my eyes.

""Kassandra, this is for your father's own good. Ashes are useless. Helping Cecilia out? It's an honor for him.""

""Get the hell off me!""

Fueled by the absurdity of it all, I lashed out, shoving his goons aside and snatching the urn back.

Then, a brutal blow cracked against the back of my head.

Warm blood trickled down my forehead, blurring my vision.

I couldn't hold onto the urn anymore. Soon, someone ripped it from my arms.

In agony, I raised my head and, under the harsh sun, saw Augustine's cold face.

""Deliver it to the sorcerer,"" he said.

I forced a bitter smile and then blacked out.

Chapter 2

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

My loyal aide filled me in: Augustine had spent the last few days in Centennial Hills with Cecilia.

He had used my father's ashes for some twisted black magic ritual, trying to bind my dad's spirit, forcing his ghost to serve Cecilia like some obedient phantom.

I yanked out the IV needle, gathered a squad of men I'd trained, and went straight there.

Cecilia was lounging on the sofa, sipping coffee, her face draining of color when she saw me burst through the door.

I scanned the opulent villa and found a brand-new altar in the corner.

There, staring back at me, was my father's portrait.

The sight ignited an inferno of rage inside me, flames licking at my veins.

""Kassandra, you're not welcome here! If you try anything, I'll make sure Augustine...""

Before she could finish her threat, I lunged, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking her toward the altar.

""Looks like you still don't get it.

""I'm Augustine's real wife. Every damn penny from his arms empire? Half of it's mine! If I want you out of here, you won't last an hour.""

I stamped on her wrist with my combat boot, grinding down hard.

Cecilia let out a piercing shriek, agony ripping through her.

""You... you old hag! Augustine will never let you get away with this!""

I sneered, tightening my grip on her hair and slamming her face into the floor.

""You think you can stay young forever? In this world, youth is the cheapest commodity.

""You wanted my dad's ashes to break your curse? Foot-soaking's not enough. Here—drink every last drop of that filthy water!""

I signaled my men to hold her down, then poured the basin of ash-tainted water straight down her throat.

For every spill, I slapped her hard across the face.

By the time I let go, her cheeks were swollen, her lips bloodied.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps echoed behind us.

Augustine arrived, radiating an arctic chill, his private army following close behind, all weapons drawn and ready.

""Kassandra, you've crossed the line.""

His voice was a frozen blade as he bent down and scooped up the limp woman in his arms.

I met his glare head-on. ""Mr. Clayton, compared to what you've done, this is nothing.""

His eyes blazed with arctic rage.

""Throw her into the snake pit out back. No one pulls her out without my order.""

It was the venomous viper den he'd excavated just to indulge Cecilia's twisted whims.

""You wanted to watch an execution, right? Today, you'll get your fill,"" he murmured tenderly to the woman in his embrace.

Two burly guards dragged me roughly toward the rear of the property.

In the chilling depths of the cavern, serpents slithered forth, fangs sinking into my flesh with searing venom.

Agony exploded through me, blood soaking my clothes in a warm, sticky flood.

Before oblivion claimed me, I caught Cecilia's triumphant cackle.

I twisted my lips into a silent, sardonic smile.

Eight years ago, in front of all the crime lords, Augustine had sworn he'd only ever want me.

But his heart and his vows? They'd soured in just eight short years.

I spent two weeks in the hospital, nursing my wounds back to health.

During that time, the scandal exploded across Las Vegas: Augustine Clayton, pampering his mistress while letting his own wife bleed out in a snake pit. The whole city was buzzing.

On the day I was discharged, I made good on my promise—I shattered Augustine's father's coffin to pieces.

After venting my fury, I went to see Shelly.

""Shelly,"" I said, stepping into the room.

She opened her eyes, her gaze a tangled mix of pity and resignation.

""Could you pass this divorce agreement to Augustine for me?"" I handed over the papers, along with the newspaper that described my humiliating story.

""Kassandra, men are all the same. You need to wise up. Compared to power and money, love's just a fleeting illusion.

""Only when you stop letting a man control your heart do you truly come out on top.""

The destruction of her husband's coffin didn't faze her in the least.

In their youth, Augustine's father had chased countless mistresses and left a string of illegitimate children. She'd long since lost any illusions about him.

""Shelly, I married Augustine not because he was some rich heir, but because he was Augustine.""

It was love at first sight. Back in the boxing ring, covered in blood, his eyes fierce and unyielding—that image had pierced straight through my soul.

These eight years, leveraging the Clayton family's influence to build arms channels and a network of my own. I was no longer the vulnerable girl who needed his protection.

I'd stayed by his side only because I couldn't let go of that love, even as it rotted away.

""Once you're divorced, his mistresses will trample all over you,"" Shelly said.

I smiled. ""If she's got what it takes, let her try to climb.""

Chapter 3

When it came to Augustine's mistress, I felt nothing.

I knew Cecilia wasn't much of a threat.

A woman like her could only rely on her looks, and no true arms dealer would ever marry a woman who had nothing but a pretty face to offer.

Shelly stayed silent for a long time before finally ordering the maid to take away the divorce papers and the newspaper.

She stared at me for a while, then sighed. ""You know, there are countless women who would kill to be in your position.""

I didn't respond, just offered her a slight, respectful bow, and turned to leave.

Everyone envied me for standing at the pinnacle of power in Las Vegas, but only I knew what it truly cost.

My marriage with Augustine was like a field of poppies—beautiful on the surface but poisonous at its core.

As I stepped out, I ran into Augustine's cousin, Felicia Clayton.

""I thought you'd tolerate him for the rest of your life,"" she said dryly.

""I used to think so too,"" I replied with a faint smile.

She smirked. ""I'll admit, I never really liked you. But between you and that tramp from the red-light district in Mexico, I'd pick you any day.""

""You've been with him for eight years,"" she continued, folding her arms. ""You're really just going to walk away? Don't you feel it's a waste? You could still cash out.""

I chuckled. ""If I stay any longer, I might not make it out alive. What good is his money if I'm dead?""

Felicia burst out laughing. ""Relax. Good men are everywhere! After the divorce, I'll introduce you to someone—better than Augustine, richer than Augustine, and probably more of a gentleman too.""

That evening, Shelly's maid brought me the signed divorce papers.

I immediately sent them to the courthouse to finalize the process. Then, finally allowing myself to relax, I drew a hot bath.

Just as I was sinking into the water with a glass of red wine, the door burst open. Augustine stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

He braced his arms on the edge of the tub, trapping me between them, his voice low and lazy. ""Good evening, darling.""

My hand froze midair.

I realized then that Shelly must've tricked him into signing those papers. He clearly had no idea what he'd signed.

Otherwise, he wouldn't still be calling me ""darling.""

I stood, wrapping a robe around myself, and pushed him away coldly.

""Still throwing tantrums?"" he asked, grabbing my wrist. ""Cecilia's nothing. It's over.""

I caught sight of the lipstick smudged on his collar and wrenched my hand free.

""It's not a tantrum. It's disgusting.

""Your taste, Augustine, is as cheap as the perfume Cecilia drowns herself in. It's revolting.""

The next day, for the first time, we didn't attend the Las Vegas jewelry auction together.

Augustine showed up with Cecilia on his arm, stealing the spotlight the moment they walked in.

When I entered the hall, I overheard him introducing Cecilia to the investors as his woman.

Someone spotted me and greeted, ""Mrs. Clayton!""

""Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clayton,"" Cecilia mocked, her tone sugary and cruel. ""That dress looks a little... modest for the occasion, doesn't it?""

I lifted my hand slightly, revealing the emerald ring that symbolized my status as Augustine's wife. ""What I wear doesn't matter,"" I said coolly. ""What matters is that everyone here knows exactly who Mrs. Clayton is.

""Men like to have their fun sometimes. Ms. Webster, not everyone has your... devotion—content to be a mistress for life.""

Onstage, the host invited Augustine and his wife to unveil the centerpiece.

Augustine extended his hand toward me. ""Come on. Don't keep them waiting.""

His intent was obvious—to give me an easy way down and to show the world our marriage was still unshaken.

We unveiled the piece together and delivered our speeches—every move was flawless, every word in perfect harmony.

The soft golden lights traced the angles of his face, so familiar yet so distant.

The warm stage lights traced the mature lines of his profile, and for a moment, I was transported back eight years, to when we had first taken over a smuggling route together.

That night, after securing our first million-dollar deal, he had slipped this very ring onto my finger aboard a yacht.

I smiled and whispered, ""Mr. Clayton, what a wild ride through blood and flames.""

But the human heart, I realized, was far more unpredictable than any gamble in Las Vegas.

Chapter 4

I excused myself from the crowd, claiming I needed some air, and stepped out onto the terrace.

Cecilia followed me out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

""Ms. Lambert,"" she called, voice dripping with challenge.

I turned, regarding her with cool detachment.

""Four years ago, the night you had your miscarriage, Augustine told you he was away on business,"" she spat, aiming to twist the knife. ""He was actually in my bed.""

I took a slow drag of my cigarette, exhaled, and met her gaze, calm as ever.

""I thought you'd have learned some tact by now,"" I said quietly.

Her eyes flashed. ""He loves me. He said he'd divorce you and marry me. He promised I'd have everything.""

I laughed. The sound came out low, amused, and almost pitying.

""He said that in bed, didn't he? That's his favorite place to make promises.""

I flicked ash off my cigarette. ""Every woman who's come to me has said the same thing. Tell me, what makes you any different?""

I stubbed out the cigarette and turned to leave.

But as I brushed past, she suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""The first time I stepped into his house, I knew you were just lucky,"" she spat. ""You and I came from the same dirt. Why you? Why did you get to be his wife?

""I'm younger. I'm prettier. I should've been the one!""

Her voice shook with anger and envy. ""Please, just divorce him! Let him go!""

I frowned and started to pull away. But suddenly, a deafening crash exploded from below.

The floor shuddered violently, and the terrace rail groaned and began to split.

By the time Augustine and his men rushed in, the terrace had cracked in two. Cecilia and I were stranded on opposite sides, the structure crumbling beneath us.

""Mr. Clayton, the structure won't hold!"" one of his men shouted. ""You've gotta save one first!""

A second collapse could hit any second; whoever got left behind was as good as dead.

Cecilia screamed, sobbing hysterically. My knuckles were white against the ledge.

""Augustine!"" I cried. ""The night I lost our baby—you swore you'd never hurt me again!""

It was all I had left to bargain with. Even if love was gone, maybe his guilt wasn't.

Augustine's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes darting in tortured hesitation.

Then Cecilia shrieked, ""Augustine! I'm pregnant with your child!""

His eyes widened. And in that instant, I knew.

""Save Cecilia first!"" he shouted.

I watched as they pulled her to safety, her tears shining in the chaos.

Then the stone beneath my hands gave way.

Weightlessness hit me like a punch—I plummeted downward, eyes squeezing shut in resignation.

I got it. Cecilia had his child growing inside her; I was just yesterday's flame. How could I compete?

Luck—or irony—saved me.

I crashed into a canopy, which broke my fall.

After a day and night lost to unconsciousness, the rescue team found me.

When I awoke, the media frenzy was in full swing.

The title read, ""Las Vegas Collapse Suspected as Rival Sabotage: Augustine Jets Off to Switzerland with Shaken Lover for Recuperation.""

In the photos, his arm was wrapped protectively around her waist. Their departure date was the same day I was wheeled into surgery.

It was just like when I lost our baby. I'd lain alone in that hospital bed too—abandoned, forgotten.

While Augustine was away, I recovered in silence, enjoying the rare peace.

His deputy kept sending over lavish gifts: orchids air-shipped from France and exquisite jewels that screamed opulence.

I threw every single one out.

When I was finally discharged, I went to my old house in North Las Vegas.

There, I burned everything Augustine had ever given me.

As I walked out of the alley, a black military jeep was parked at the corner.

Augustine stood beside it, watching me.

""Cecilia's pregnant,"" he said quietly.

Augustine leaned against the hood of his black SUV, lit a cigar, and dropped the bombshell of his mistress's pregnancy.

I didn't flinch.

""According to the agreement, when we divorce, the assets are split sixty–forty. You take the forty."" My voice was steady, emotionless.

""My mother's made it clear—only you can be my wife,"" he continued, his tone smooth, calculated. ""You don't have to worry. Even if Cecilia gives birth, she'll never be allowed to outrank you.

""I can live without a mistress, Kassandra, but not without a wife who can fight alongside me.""

It hit me like a cold splash. He didn't want a divorce, but it was not because he loved me, but because I was still useful to him.

""So what?"" I said coldly. ""I'm not the one keeping you from your true love. It's your mother. If you've got a problem, take it up with her,"" I shot back icily, sidestepping him to walk away.

""My mom wants you at the Clayton's mansion in three days,"" he said behind me. ""Once Cecilia's baby is born, you will be that baby's mother.""

I didn't break stride, my heels clicking defiantly against the pavement.

That night, I took another car back to our villa in Summerlin.

The first thing I did was check my accounts. Several tens of millions of dollars sat quietly in them. A fortune by ordinary standards, but compared to Augustine's arms empire, it was barely a ripple.

They say when a man gains wealth, he loses his morals. And when a woman loses her morals, she gains wealth.

If I were truly heartless, I could've stayed—lived on as Mrs. Clayton in name and enjoyed the money, the diamonds, and the power.

But I was done living a lie. I didn't want to rot away in this gilded cage any longer.

That night, I bought a one-way ticket to Dubai.

I'd leave the moment the divorce papers were finalized.

Three days later, I arrived at the Clayton mansion for the meeting. The air inside was heavy with tension.

The argument revolved entirely around Cecilia—whether she, armed with her pregnancy, could claw her way into legitimacy.

Shelly's tone was firm. ""The child cannot stay. The heir of our family will not be born from a disgrace.""

Augustine tapped his fingers on the table, his voice low but steady. ""Once the baby is born, I'll announce to the public that it's Kassandra's. She can't have kids of her own—this fixes everything perfectly.""

""No,"" Shelly cut him off sharply.

I set down my teacup and said quietly, ""The night I miscarried, you swore you'd never have a child with another woman for as long as you lived.""

Augustine's reply came low and gravelly, laced with weary resignation. ""Kassandra, we can't keep chaining ourselves to old vows forever.""

Before I could respond, a car horn blared outside—the courier had arrived.

I went out to sign for the delivery.

Inside the envelope were two divorce certificates.

I took mine, slipped it neatly into my bag, and turned to go back in.

As I turned my head, I saw Cecilia standing there, eyes burning with hatred.

""Kassandra, I hate you! Why do they all protect you?"" She screamed, her voice shrill and shaking.

I ignored her and moved to pass, but she grabbed my wrist with surprising strength.

""I'll make sure he never looks at you again!"" She shouted, and before I could react, she snatched a fruit knife from the table and plunged it into her own abdomen.

Augustine and others came running at the sound. When they arrived, Cecilia was curled on the floor, blood soaking through her dress.

""Augustine... She tried to kill me... She wanted to kill our baby...""

She gasped, her voice weak but clear enough to condemn me.

""Kassandra!"" Augustine roared. He scooped Cecilia into his arms, his eyes blazing with fury.

I stood there, unmoved. ""If the baby's gone, she has no one to blame but herself.""

The next second, his hand struck my face.

The sharp crack echoed through the hall.

""You evil bitch,"" he hissed, his voice colder than steel. ""We'll settle this when I get back.""

With that, he carried Cecilia out. I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth and watched their car disappear into the distance.

Just then, my phone buzzed—a flight reminder. The plane to Los Angeles would be boarding soon.

Felicia approached quietly and gestured for me to check my messages.

A new text from her read, ""Sandra, I know that wasn't your doing. When you get to Dubai, contact this man. He runs a large arms business... and he's always admired you.""

I looked at the familiar name and number on the screen, then nodded slowly.

""Give this to Augustine,"" I said, handing her the copy of his divorce certificate.

""He's waited eight years for this moment. Tell him congratulations—from me.""

Then I picked up my suitcase and walked away without looking back.

I'd transfer in Los Angeles before heading to Dubai.

At the airport, I paused for a moment, watching the planes lift and vanish into the burning Nevada sky. Then I dialed the number Felicia had sent me.

A low, confident voice answered, warm with amusement. ""Long time no see, Sandra. When you land in Dubai, I'll be there to pick you up.""

""Alright,"" I replied softly.

I closed my eyes for a second, clutching my one-way ticket out of Las Vegas.

In my heart, I whispered, ""Augustine, we've tangled for eight long years.

""It's time I let you go... and set myself free.""",3,1763548863.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1p149ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1p149ug/best_travel_makeup_bags/,Best Travel Makeup Bags,"Picture this: I open my suitcase after a 12-hour flight, already looking forward to a shower. Instead, I find my favorite sundress drenched in foundation, my jeans smeared with concealer, and a pool of micellar water at the bottom. One burst seal. Thousands of dollars in ruined luggage. I've since become obsessed with finding makeup bags that actually work.

After testing dozens of options and scouring what real travelers say on forums, I've found the bags that genuinely solve this problem. Some are cheap enough to toss after a trip. Others are investment pieces that'll last a decade. Here's what actually works.

# 1. BAGSMART Travel Makeup Organizer — Best Overall Value

**Price**: $18–28 | **Size**: Multiple options

This bag changed everything for me because it addresses the actual problem: liquids leaking everywhere. The waterproof interior isn't just marketing—it's actually waterproof. I've had lipstick smudges wipe clean with a damp cloth, and the compartments keep everything separated so nothing settles at the bottom and gets crushed.

The hanging hook means you can hang it on hotel bathroom doors (genius), and the see-through pockets let you spot your mascara without digging. It fits full-size bottles and makeup brushes, which matters if you're not willing to downsize everything.

The catch? After two years of heavy travel, mine's getting a bit worn. The zippers are still smooth, but the nylon shows creasing. If you travel casually, this'll last longer. It's not a forever bag, but at under $30, you can replace it twice before hitting luxury bag prices.

# 2. Kusshi Signature Makeup Bag — Best for Organized Travelers

**Price**: $69 | **Size**: Compact but surprisingly spacious

Kusshi bags open like a tray, not a traditional makeup bag. This single feature changes everything. Instead of rummaging through a bag, everything's visible at once. No more hunting for that one lipstick buried at the bottom.

The spill-proof lining is actually spill-proof (not like some bags that claim this and fail). The brush pockets keep brushes organized separately, and the bag sits nicely on hotel sinks without tipping over. Reviewers consistently say it holds more than expected—people pack full-size products, hair tools, and skincare essentials without stuffing.

The downside: It's not cheap, and the tray design means it takes up more space when closed than some other bags. If you're a minimalist packer, this might be overkill. But if you travel with a full routine and value organization, this is worth every penny.

# 3. Glossier Beauty Bag — Best if You Carry Everything

**Price**: $48 | **Size**: Large

I was skeptical about a beauty brand making luggage, but Glossier nailed it. This bag is genuinely roomy—tall enough for full-size skincare bottles, wide enough for makeup palettes without crushing them. The coated cotton is water-resistant without being stiff, and it actually looks good sitting on a bathroom counter (not all bags manage this).

The hard exterior case protects fragile items like eyeshadow palettes during travel. I've tossed this in overhead bins, thrown it in carry-ons, and even checked it once without anything breaking.

Real talk: It's not a hanging organizer, so you're not getting those convenient hotel hooks. And at nearly $50, it's not the cheapest option. But if you want a bag that looks aesthetically pleasing AND functions as serious protection for a full makeup collection, this delivers.

# 4. Cuyana Leather Travel Case Duo — Best Investment Piece

**Price**: $95–120 | **Size**: Large + small set

This is the bag people keep for a decade. The Argentinian pebbled leather feels substantial, and it arrives with proper weight to it—not flimsy. What makes it special is that you get two cases. Use both for longer trips, or just pack one smaller case for weekends.

The real genius: the leather lining wipes clean with a damp cloth. You can literally use micellar water on a cotton pad and restore it. I've seen these bags that have traveled for 10+ years and still look intentional, not beat-up.

The honest downside? It's an investment. If you lose a bag or it gets stolen, that stings. And leather requires slightly more care than nylon. But quality-obsessed travelers swear by this for good reason—these bags actually improve with age.

# 5. Relavel Makeup Train Case — Best for the Full Glam Kit

**Price**: $35–50 | **Size**: Professional-grade

This is what makeup artists use, and there's a reason. The adjustable dividers mean you customize it exactly to your collection. Brushes, palettes, lipsticks—everything gets its own space. The snap locks are solid, and the handle is genuinely comfortable even when fully loaded.

The deep sections mean full-size products fit without cramming. Unlike some bags that force you to choose between foundation bottles and eyeshadow palettes, this holds both without compromise.

The catch: It's structured and takes up real luggage space. If you're a minimalist or packing a carry-on only, this is oversized. It also doesn't hang anywhere, so you're setting it on hotel counters or sink edges. But if you travel with significant makeup and want everything protected and organized, this is the answer.

# 6. Calpak Clear Makeup Case — Best for TSA & Visibility

**Price**: $45–60 | **Size**: Medium and large

Clear bags have one massive advantage: TSA doesn't have to open them, which saves time at security. But most clear bags are flimsy. Calpak's is structured while remaining transparent. You can see exactly what's where without opening it.

The two-sided case is smart—liquids on one side, makeup on the other. It's water-resistant (not fully waterproof, but good enough for most situations), and the materials actually feel like they'll survive multiple trips.

The reality: Clear bags can look a bit clinical on bathroom counters compared to leather or fabric. And the materials show every fingerprint and smudge, which bugs some people. But if TSA efficiency and knowing exactly what you've packed matter to you, this solves both problems.

# 7. Away Cosmetics Bag — Best for the Hotel Bathroom

**Price**: $45 | **Size**: Compact

Away's entire luggage collection is overbuilt, so their cosmetics bag matches that philosophy. The water-resistant nylon feels durable, and the key feature is that it hangs. The hook is sturdy enough to hang from actual towel racks without ripping or sliding.

Inside, there are two roomy layers—soft compartments on top for grab-and-go items, a structured bottom for full-size bottles. The clear pouch is TSA-compliant for liquids. It's designed for the person who wants their bathroom organized without pulling everything out.

The downside: It's not the cheapest, and if you don't plan to use the hanging feature, you're paying for something you don't need. But for hotel stays where counter space is limited, this changes the morning routine.

# 8. Vera Bradley Cosmetic Organizer — Best Affordable Daily Bag

**Price**: $25–35 | **Size**: Compact to large options

Vera Bradley has been making travel bags longer than some companies have existed, and it shows. The quilted nylon is genuinely durable, and the PVC lining means spills aren't catastrophic. These bags have personality—actual colors and patterns instead of generic black.

It's lightweight, which matters for carry-ons, and the zippered compartments actually prevent items from sliding around. People who own these often own multiple because they're so practical you'll use it for home organization too.

The limitation: It's not fancy, and some of the larger styles take up notable space in luggage. But if you want a reliable bag that won't fail you and costs less than a fancy coffee machine, this works.



# What I Learned the Hard Way

After ruining clothes and testing these options, here's what actually matters:

**Get waterproof or water-resistant**, even if it costs more. That's non-negotiable.

**Size matters less than compartmentalization**. A smaller bag with dividers beats a huge bag with one empty space.

**Test the zippers.** Smooth zippers mean you won't fight your bag when you're rushing in an airport.

**Consider how you'll actually use it.** Hotel bathroom hanging? Professional makeup case? Daily purse? Choose accordingly.

The right bag doesn't just protect your makeup—it protects your entire suitcase. That sundress I ruined? It taught me that spending $30–95 on a proper bag is the cheapest insurance you'll buy for travel.

(Adım adım rehber – 2025 güncel),"Merhaba patronlar, patron adayları ve “bir gün ben de” diyenler!r/BenimIsletmem’in ilk postu hayırlı olsun. Burayı gerçek deneyimlerin, faydalı bilgilerin ve samimi muhabbetin merkezi yapalım diye, hemen işe yarar bir konuyla başlıyoruz:Google My Business (şimdi adı “Google İşletme Profili”) hala 2025’te bile Türkiye’de en güçlü ve %100 ÜCRETSİZ pazarlama aracı.  
Birçok işletmeci hâlâ ya hiç açmamış ya da açmış ama yarım yamalak doldurmuş. Bu da para demek kaçırıyor.Ben kendi işletmemde (kafede) bunu düzgün yapınca 3 ayda organik gelen müşteri sayısı %200+ arttı. Şimdi size aynı şeyi yaşatmak istiyorum.Adım adım 0’dan Google Haritalar’da parlayan işletme nasıl yaratılır?

1. Hemen ücretsiz hesap açın business Google İşletme adınız, adresiniz, kategori seçin (en spesifik olanı seçin, “kafe” yerine “espresso & specialty coffee shop” gibi).
2. Doğrulama şart! Türkiye’de genelde posta kartı geliyor (5-14 gün). Telefonla doğrulama çok nadir açılıyor ama her gün kontrol edin.
3. Fotoğraf yükleyin, bol bol!
   * En az 20-30 fotoğraf (2025 itibarıyla Google 100+ fotoğrafı olan işletmeleri daha üstte gösteriyor)
   * Logo, dış cephe, iç mekan, ürünler, ekip (gülen yüz şart), menü fotoğrafları
   * Her hafta 3-5 yeni fotoğraf ekleyin → Google sizi “aktif” sayıyor, sıralamanız fırlar.
4. Açıklama kısmını altın gibi doldurun 750 karakter var, hepsini kullanın. Anahtar kelimeleri doğal şekilde geçirin. Örnek (kafe için): “Kadıköy’ün en iyi üçüncü nesil kahvecisiEl değmeden kavrulmuş çekirdekler, ev yapımı tatlılar, ücretsiz Wi-Fi ve rahat çalışma alanı. Vegan-vejetaryen seçenekler, evcil hayvan dostu. Her gün 08:00-23:00 açık. Specialty coffee, cold brew, filtre kahve, ev yapımı limonata ve cheesecake burada!”
5. Hizmetler ve ürünler ekleyin Menünüzü tek tek yükleyin + fiyat yazın. İnsanlar “Americano fiyat” diye aratınca direkt siz çıkıyorsunuz.
6. Yorumlara cevap verin – HEPSİNE! 5 yıldız da 1 yıldız da olsa 24-48 saat içinde cevap verin. Kötü yoruma bile nazik cevap yazın → Google bunu çok seviyor, sıralamanız artıyor.
7. Haftalık post atın (Google’ın kendi post özelliği)
   * Yeni menü geldi
   * Bu hafta %20 indirim
   * Canlı müzik var Bunlar direkt Haritalar’da ve Arama’da çıkıyor, Instagram’dan bile etkili.
8. Bonus ipuçları 2025
   * İşletme saatinizi bayramlarda bile güncelleyin
   * “Rezervasyon” butonu ekleyin (WhatsApp linki koyabiliyorsunuz)
   * Q&A kısmını kendiniz sorun-cevap yazın (insanlar aratmadan bilgi alsın)
   * “Google Guaranteed” rozeti için sigorta vs. yok Türkiye’de ama “Yerel Rehber” rozetleri toplayın.

  
Benim işletmemde sadece bu adımları yaparak aylık 150.000+ gösterim ve 4.000+ “yol tarifi” tıklaması alıyoruz. Hepsi bedava.Siz de yaptınız mı?  
Kaç yıldızınız var?

It’s one of those mornings where the sky is the colour of sleep, the rain won’t stop tapping at the window, and the only thing keeping me alive is a too-hot mug of coffee. I’m working from home, wrapped up in a hoodie, and honestly… it would be a lot nicer with someone to talk to.

If you’re also indoors hiding from this miserable weather, come keep me company. I’m looking for warm conversation, playful back-and-forth, maybe a voice call if we click. Nothing intense, nothing complicated — just two people making a grey morning feel a little less grey.

I’m into films, F1, football, good food, reading, and exploring new music. Bonus points if you can match energy, humour, or sarcasm.

If you want some cosy company while you work (or procrastinate), send a message and let’s make this morning a bit warmer.

I got a used (cheap) espresso machine from a friend for free recently and figured I'll need a decent grinder If I'm getting into espresso. I have a cheap Wilfa WSCG-2 grinder that isn't great and definitely doesn't do espresso.

I usually make a pour over in the morning and an espresso or two in the afternoon, so I would be switching grind settings daily. Although keeping the old grinder for pour over would be an option. But due to limited space I would much prefer keeping just one grinder. As for what precisely I want from the grinder I'm not too sure as I'm quite new to this. Something that can grind for decent espresso and, if possible, also works for pour over with easy switching between the two. Preferably also long lasting as this is a fairly big investment for me.

I've narrowed down my options (in Finland) to the following (other suggestions also welcome):

Eureka Mignon Zero 55s (\~250**€**) from a retailer in Finland

Baratza Encore ESP (\~220**€**) from a retailer in Finland

DF54 V3 (\~220**€**) from China via [df64coffee.com](http://df64coffee.com) (or 300€ from a retailer in Finland)

The funny thing is, I used to be fearless — I once jumped out of an airplane for fun. I’ve flown to multiple continents, visited different countries, and traveled all over the U.S. without a problem. But everything changed after one specific incident.

Years ago, I was in Israel staying at the Bedouin tents. I rarely drink coffee, but that morning I woke up before everyone else and had some. It was the best coffee I’d ever tasted — so good that I ended up drinking five cups, even though I normally never drink that much caffeine.

By the time we arrived at the Dead Sea, everything hit me. Time felt like it was narrowing in. My palms were sweaty. My heart started racing, then slowing, then racing again. I genuinely felt like my heart was stopping and starting. I wasn’t just anxious — I was in full-blown panic. It lasted the entire visit until I finally had to be taken to an emergency hospital because I felt like something was seriously wrong.

That incident triggered something in me. Since then, anxiety has become a major part of my life.

Later, while in Africa near Mount Kilimanjaro, I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life — so severe that I truly thought I was having a stroke. I had to cancel half my trip and fly to Kenya to get checked for a heart attack or stroke.

Then came the flight from LAX to New York. The pilot announced — after 40 years of flying and being an Air Force pilot — that it was going to be a very rough landing. The turbulence was horrible, the plane dropped in altitude, and I was convinced we were crashing. I was FaceTiming my husband and my mother, crying, saying goodbye. I locked myself in the airplane bathroom and refused to come out. I came close to being arrested, but the crew understood I had severe anxiety.

My most recent long flights were to Hong Kong and Taiwan. They were also rough, and since then my biggest fear has been turbulence and those sudden drops in altitude. I can’t even sit near a window anymore because the second I look down, the anxiety hits instantly.

Now I’m a day away from flying from LAX to Alaska, and I am terrified. My anxiety is constant. Every time I close my eyes, I imagine the plane falling out of the sky. The anticipation alone gives me days of panic. I wish I still had the courage and confidence I had when I was younger, but the fear has become more crippling with age.

I’ve tried hypnosis, breathing exercises, grounding techniques — everything. But the moment turbulence hits or anything feels even slightly off, my mind spirals and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. It’s truly the worst feeling in the world.",1,1763548145.0,fearofflying,1,1.0,False

1p1435f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p1435f/time_for_downvotes_most_of_you_grounded_skin/,Time for Downvotes: Most of you “grounded skin” people are liars,"Edit: of course only one person actually engages.

Incoming Essay  TLDR: Silly Costumes are JUST as justified as these skins of “operators” in casual dress some of you call grounded.

to START before most of you go “I ain’t reading allat”  - There’s soldiers in Ukraine right now with ANIME GIRLS on their guns so just read or don’t bother commenting. 

foe those about to jump on the “but you can jump out of planes and rendezook”  were talking VISUALS here. they’re completely separate. unless you think forza and gran turismo should have Mario karts in them because gameplay wise, such as ramming a wall at full speed and being fine, they’re not realistic. helL even in ARMA, you can RESPAWN?!???? you literally teleport into vehicles?!???? fuck it add laser guns. what kind of simulator lets you respawn? when you die your pc/console should explode and actually kill you. crash in Forza? your gaming chair or couch should speed at 200kmh into a wall and kill you. Gameplay =\\= visuals. they’re separate.

How many times have we seen “we want the grunt fantasy!”. “We want the soldiers to look like soldiers!”. “You’re supposed to be just the grunt on the ground! not some special hero!”.

Now we have those 323 skins being praised to the high heavens and these new skins with orange T shirt being slammed.

Sorry peeps. They are the same.

The people dressed in casual clothing are NOT the military grunts being shipped off to fight large scale operations.

Those “photos” you see of people in casual dress? they’re special forces often on SECURITY detail OUTSIDE of active operation zones. Go look up those people when theyre actually deployed. they’re dressed like everyone else.

Those photos of Obi Wan Nairobi going around? it was a response to a TERRORIST attack.

Those photos of merc groups and PMCs in casual dress? go look up when they’re deployed to active combat zones. they’re in full military fatigues.

you people do not want “grunt fantasy”. you want the modern G I Joe you’ve seen from movies. you want the main characters from Call of Duty campaigns. a black woman with dreads with aviators and an orange t shirt with tactical gear running around an active combat zone? GOD FORBID! A bunch of dudes in flannel and sneakers because you’ve scene out of context photos that are so far removed from the scenarios battlefield represents? YES PLEASE FEED ME MORE! it’s LITERALLY the same SAME SHIT.

you can NOT on one hand say you want “grunts” then use SPECIAL FORCES operating outside of the scenarios this game represents as an excuse. you’re being JUST as ridiculous as people who don’t care if they add dinosaurs.

guess what? there’s literal photos of soldiers on front lines wearing halloween costumes doing stupid shit in combat. you can find all sorts of silly photos of soldiers doing stupid things and wearing stupid things in combat. so because there’s photos of soldiers loading artillery shells in dinosaur costumes now we can expect dinosaur skins right? what’s that you say? he wasn’t on the front lines? well then you can’t use Christian Craighead as an example for having jeans and a purple shirt either. that wasn’t a combat operation, it was a response to a terrorist attack. look up photos of him deployed. he’s in military fatigues. like everyone else.

I can make this even more ridiculous. why not have claymore swords and bows and arrows? after all, people went into combat in WWII with them. actually, marine officers wear them on their formal dress! why not have sabers?! I’m sure there’s an example we can find somewhere of a marine using a saber.

if you’re going to complain about skins, be honest. you can NOT praise the “casual dress” “operators” when silly costumes are just as common place on battlefields. that is to say - next to zero. you’re picking and choosing out of context images to justify what you PERSONALLY like. for every “casual dress operator” ON A BATTLEFIELD you can find, I can find a guy with no pants on or in a Halloween costume.

NOW before you donkeys who try and say I’m the guy defending stupid out of place skins? NOPE.

I don’t think ANY of it belongs in the game. what I got out of battlefield was the FANTASY of a proper military that LOOKED the part. not PLAYED as a sim. the problem people like ME have now is we no longer have the arcade shooter that has the military aesthetic. if you want the military look? you HAVE to play simulators these days. The only place you get a shooter that isn’t filled with out of place cosmetics is simulators.

TLDR:

You either want BATTLEFIELD to look like two proper militaries fighting, which would be ALL combat fatigues and combat gear OR some silly shit is on the table. you can’t pick and choose. There are just as many silly real world examples as there are “operators” in casual dress in active combat zones. not terrorist responses, not SF at a coffee shop suddenly needing to grab their shit and go, not PMCs on security detail.

1p142is,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1p142is/melatonin_healed_me/,Melatonin healed me?,"After dealing with Type C gastritis for a year now, I feel like I’m healed and it’s pretty confusing. I tried everything from Omeprazole to Pantoprazole to Gaviscon and other supplements, nothing worked. I read a post on this sub about melatonin and I tried it, made me feel worse. I thought I fell into another Reddit rabbit hole of false information. 

Then I saw someone mention that some melatonin supplements may contain harmful additives. I looked at my bottle and it contained citrus and other harmful oils. No wonder it caused me problems. 

Anyway, I tried again but this time with a melatonin pill without additives, it worked. Started with 3mg and went down to 1mg and after 4 days my gastritis was healed. I thought I was tripping. Before I could not eat anything without reflux and flare ups. Now I eat everything, even tried coffee, chocolate and foods that trigger me, yet no gastritis. I feel totally healed in a short time. 

It’s a bit confusing. I spent a lot of money on several medications and doctors, only for a 10 EUR melatonin to heal me in 4 days??? It’s been a month now and I’m still healed. I take 1mg a night now. I’m hoping it won’t revert back. ",9,1763548020.0,Gastritis,7,0.92,False
