I’m looking for recommendations to expand my fragrance collection, and I’d love to hear your suggestions. I’m after **fragrances** with **loud projection**, **great longevity**, and, of course an amazing scent, the **best fragrances you can think of**!

I’ll share a list of the fragrances I already own, along with the ones currently on my wish list, to give you a better idea of my preferences. I’m a big fan of **gourmand and oriental fragrances**, but I’m open to exploring other styles if you think they’re worth it.

Feel free to ask me any questions, and I’ll do my best to respond. To make things easier, I’ll also share my ratings and reviews of the fragrances I have.

  
**Fragrance Reviews:**

**#1: French Avenue Liquid Brun**

**Rating:** 9/10

**Clone of:** Parfums de Marly Althair

Wow, what a stunning fragrance this is! Liquid Brun is the most expensive clone in my collection, but it’s worth every penny. The warm, spicy vanilla and cinnamon notes are absolutely addictive—I can’t stop smelling it! It’s incredibly close to the original, at about 95% accuracy.

• **Projection:** Solid for 4 hours, then becomes a skin scent.

• **Longevity:** 8–10 hours.

  
**#2: Club de Nuit Intense Man Limited Edition (CDNMI LE)**

**Rating:** 9.5/10

**Clone of:** Creed Aventus

This one was quite the rollercoaster! I was so hyped for this fragrance, but my first experience was a complete disaster. When I initially sprayed it, it was one of the harshest things I’d ever smelled—like someone squeezing lemon juice straight into my nose. It was sharp, overwhelming, and I couldn’t detect anything else.

I decided to stay patient and let it macerate, and wow—it completely blew my mind. The harshness was gone, leaving behind a beautifully balanced, stellar fragrance.

• **Projection:** Loud for 4–6 hours, then softer but still noticeable.

• **Longevity:** 10+ hours.

  
**#3: Afnan 9 PM**

**Rating:** 9/10

**Clone of:** Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male

This fragrance holds a special place in my heart because the original JPG Ultra Male was my signature scent for a few years. Afnan 9 PM is about 92% similar to the original, with amazing performance and projection.

• **Projection:** Strong for 6+ hours.

• **Longevity:** 12+ hours.

  
**#4: Lattafa Vintage Radio**

**Rating:** 8.5/10

**Clone of:** Initio Paragon

A beautifully crafted fragrance with a unique balance of sweetness and elegance. The **plum and lavender** combination feels sophisticated yet approachable.

• **Projection:** Solid for 4 hours.

• **Longevity:** 8–10 hours.

  
**#5: Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa**

**Rating:** 8.5/10

**Twist of:** Lattafa Khamrah (Clone of SAVA Gissah)

The **boozy sweetness and coffee** create a luxurious vibe. It smells like a fragrance that could easily cost €100 or more.

• **Projection:** Strong for 5–6 hours.

• **Longevity:** 10–12 hours.

  
**#6: Lattafa Jasoor**

**Rating:** 8.2/10

**Clone of:** Valentino Uomo Born in Roma Coral Fantasy

A mass-appealing fragrance that’s easy to wear. Smells about **95% accurate** to the original but lacks a bit of the tobacco richness.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 3–4 hours.

• **Longevity:** 8+ hours.

  
**#7: Azzure Oud**

**Rating:** 8.5/10

**Clone of:** Maison Crivelli Oud Maracuja

A bold, niche-quality fragrance. The **oud and fruity notes** create a luxurious and addictive combination.

• **Projection:** Loud for 6 hours.

• **Longevity:** 10 hours.

  
**#8: Lattafa Atlas**

**Rating:** 8/10

**Clone of:** Orto Parisi Megamare

An aquatic scent that captures the **fresh, sea vibes**. Perfect for summer with its **6 hours of loud projection** and all-day longevity.

• **Projection:** Loud for 6 hours, softer for another 4.

• **Longevity:** All day (10+ hours).

  
**#9: Mexican Bronco by Volare**

**Rating:** 7.5/10

**Clone of:** Xerjoff Naxos

An addictive **honey and tobacco** scent, perfect for summer evenings. However, **projection lasts 1–2 hours**, and **longevity is about 6 hours**. Hoping maceration will improve performance.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 1–2 hours.

• **Longevity:** 6 hours.

  
**#10: Maison Alhambra Winston (Formally The Tux)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10

**Clone of:** YSL Tuxedo

An elegant and refined scent, but the **projection and longevity** are moderate at best.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 3–4 hours.

• **Longevity:** 6–7 hours.

  
**#11: Lattafa Caprice**

**Rating:** 7/10

**Clone of:** YSL La Nuit de L’Homme Blue Électrique

A **safe and non-offensive scent**, but a bit **boring** for my taste.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 2 hours.

• **Longevity:** 6 hours.

  
**Wish List: Clones I’m Interested In**

• **Liam Grey** — Clone of **BDK Gris Charnel**

• **Tom Ford Noir Extreme**

• **Al Haramain Amber Oud Gold Extrait Pure Parfum** — Clone of **Xerjoff Erba Pura**

• **Aether** — Clone of **Parfums de Marly Greenley**

• **Fragrance World The Shadow** — Clone of **Nishane Ani**

• **Al Haramain Aqua Dubai** — Clone of **Louis Vuitton Imagination**

I had this crazy idea: make high-quality mechanical watches that don’t cost an arm and a leg. Sounds easy, right? But I had zero sales and zero followers. Just me, my computer, and a dream (and a lot of coffee).

The first few days were brutal. No one knew who we were, and my website was gathering digital dust. I even stared at the Shopify dashboard like it owed me money. Then came the moment of truth: my first sale.

It was an accidental purchase, to be honest. A friend from college, who I hadn’t talked to in years, stumbled across the site, bought a watch, and sent me a message like, “Hey, nice site. Figured I’d support.” I was ecstatic. You would’ve thought I won the lottery.

I couldn’t believe it! A complete stranger—okay, well, kinda stranger—was buying a watch from my brand. That’s when the floodgates opened (okay, more like a trickle). Slowly, one sale led to another. Word of mouth and some Instagram ads helped me reach people who were actually interested in mechanical watches.

Now, ARTHEMIS is more than just a hobby project. It’s still growing, still learning, but those first few sales are forever etched in my heart. They proved that even the smallest spark can turn into something big.

So here I am, still ticking away, making watches that I’m proud of. Thanks to those early supporters who took a chance on ARTHEMIS, I’m not just selling watches—I’m telling stories with every tick.",1,1737554728.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to do some sewing, but my machine just got back from the shop and in the meantime I had filled my sewing table with an enormous pile of Christmas stuff, mail, things I had packed and unpacked from travel, and a few new storage containers, ironically. 

Well, that meant that I needed to reorganize all the sewing supplies. So I cleared the table off by putting everything on the bed, and added all the random sewing stuff from around the room. 

My bedroom is also my workplace, and I realized my ""stick a bin everywhere"" method was getting a little too chaotic, so I added all the random stuff to the bed pile. And then immediately got overwhelmed at the mountain of stuff but unfortunately I was going to need to sleep later, so I couldn't just leave it until the next time we moved. 

I worked in 10 minute spurts over the next several hours but again hit a wall, and my husband came home and immediately clocked me. He took one look at the remaining hillside of objects and asked, ""Did you get stuck? Do you need me to help you?"" I said yes, but then remembered that his method of organizing is to put everything in a tote and put it in the garage. (I should clarify that we each have our own bedroom/office due to sleep issues and the way he drinks coffee, so this was 100% my stuff.)

Luckily, the combined threat of his ""help"" and the impending bedtime deadline broke my paralysis and I was able to finish sorting things out on my own while he provided water and words of affirmation. Then he did trash removal while I finally remembered to eat dinner at 9pm.

It’s a delicate balance, much like trying to navigate a conversation with your in-laws during the holidays—everyone’s got their opinions, and it can get messy if you aren’t careful.

First, let’s talk value. You’ve got to ask yourself what makes your product or service stand out. What’s that magic ingredient that transforms a boring old cupcake into a gourmet delight? Look at your competitors, but don’t just mirror their prices like a parrot—you’re not here to squawk back what they’re doing. Instead, find that unique value proposition, sprinkle in some of your personal flair, and capture what people are genuinely willing to pay. This requires a bit of market research; ask your loyal customers for input because they’ll appreciate being part of the process. Talking to them might also provide some great insight—like how some folks truly believe there’s a direct relationship between the price of a coffee and its ability to kickstart their day. 

Now, once you’ve set your price, it’s time to test the waters. This isn’t a one-time thing; pricing isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it situation. Think of it more like a workout routine—constant tweaking and readjusting is key. You might start with a promo offer or an introductory price to gauge how the market responds. Keep your eyes peeled for feedback; watch those sales figures like you’re eyeing the last donut at a staff meeting.

Don't forget to analyze the data. Stepping back and looking at trends will reveal if customers are biting at your price or if they’re shrugging their shoulders and moving on. If sales are sluggish, you might need to rethink your approach. Maybe your value isn't resonating, or perhaps you need to lower your price a notch—no shame in that! Adjust and keep the conversation with your customers going. 

Ultimately, this pricing venture is all about community. People need to feel the value of what you're offering. In the end, the goal isn’t to just set a price tag; it’s about fostering a relationship with your customers, making them feel valued, and providing them with something they can’t resist. Just like in faith, it’s a journey—one that requires a little courage, a little humility, and a sprinkle of humor along the way. Keep iterating, listening, and you'll find the right balance that resonates with both your mission and your customers.",1,1737554516.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1i7bpvk,https://i.redd.it/8wckkrlexjee1.jpeg,"53 - Wife says it’s enough, don’t need any more abs?","5’10” 185.  Been dieting and working out 3x a week for 14 months.  

I do chest shoulders and back.  I do 155 lb 8 times on bench. I now can do 8.5 pull ups and two other sets of 7. 

I did a bulk last spring and am 6 weeks into a cut where calories are in deficit of at least 500 calories.  Diet is coffee and milk until noon, then 2cups egg whites, 1 large potato, 1 cup Greek yogurt and fruit.

Dinner is 1/2 lb of meat, 1 large potato and greens.

No mayo ketchup cheese etc anymore. Hardly any alcohol. On rare holidays weekends I fast before the big meal.

With 500 calorie deficit I should lose 3500 calories a week and 4 lbs of fat a month. 

I do 2 warm up sets then try for max weight I can go 5x. At least two exercises per day.  Don’t need legs, already fine. 

My question is:  my wife says I’m great now, but why not get back to my high school 6 pack?  I feel like at 1 lb of fat a week I’ll be there in two three months?

1i7bj99,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasting/comments/1i7bj99/adventures_in_podcasting_lessons_learned_from_the/,Adventures in Podcasting – Lessons learned from the road,"By community request this is Part II in a series detailing the mistakes I have made and lessons learned. [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasting/comments/1hw2v0z/podcast_lessons_learned_in_2024_and_heres_to_2025/) covers remote recording.

About half of my episodes are recorded on location, from five U.S. states so far, aiming for 10 states in 2025. ([AllAcrossAmerica.com](http://allacrossamerica.com/) and wherever you get your podcasts.) Happy to answer question below or just reach out to me through my website.

Note: A typical broadcast news shoot has a team of four: producer, video, sound guy, and the on-air talent. I’m solo, so I cover it all—including driving.

* Allowing your host to be a good host makes you a better guest.
   * I learned this concept from a guest on my show who had a long career as a combat spy.
* So, if they offer coffee or whatever. Say yes! (And then you can set up your audio equipment in peace while they make it.)
   * Follow the lead of your host. If they have a glass of wine, join them.
   * Bring a gift. My usuals are homemade cookies, a bottle of wine, or flowers.
* Recording on location requires a spirit of adventure and comfort with the unknown. I go into people’s home or workplaces and record in sometimes unexpected spots. It’s corny, but I hate the word “stranger.”
   * I will be meeting with someone whose family has long been associated with the New York mafia. We’ll be recording from the basement of a social club in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Do I think I’m going to get whacked? No. But I definitely makes a good story!

**Set Up**

* Ask your host (when you step into someone’s home, they become the host!) to turn off fans, window air conditioners, dehumidifiers, etc.
* **Everyone wants to sound good.** You’re the one making it happen. Don’t be afraid to lead the way here.
   * Always ask when touching/moving things. (And be sure to move things back later.)
   * Close doors to reduce echo, especially in larger rooms.
   * If the first room you’re shown doesn’t work, suggest a different room.
* I prefer to set up on a dining room table. I tell guests ahead of time, that “all we need is a table and two chairs,” so they’re aware in advance.
   * I have a small foldable tray table that I’ve considered bringing. Right now my entire kit fits in a tote bag and I would like to keep it that way. (I don’t do video on location.)
* Have your routine down: equipment and settings should be on-point. You are less likely to make mistakes if you’re following the same steps every time. The less variables the better.
* Checklists work!
* **However, some change is unavoidable when stepping outside of a studio, so be prepared for unexpected situations.**
* I carry only one set of headphones, which I use to monitor the audio during the sound check. Then I put them aside.
   * I learned from a radio broadcaster and podcaster that most people really don’t like to hear their own voice.
   * And some people don’t like their hair messed with either.
* Have backup accessory cords. (It’s great to have two of everything. Cords and adaptors are often the first things to fail.)
* Avoid recording outside when possible.
   * Weather conditions must be right, and it requires a level of technical knowledge and equipment that I don’t have.
* Be mindful of overcompensating for unique recording situations. I once recorded a guest from an outdoors picnic table. The recording had some background hissing because of the location. I got spooked and began setting the gain too low on follow-up recordings.
* Angle microphone up at 45 degrees. I don’t like it when a microphone covers someone’s mouth straight on. I feel like I’m looking at them from behind a mask.
   * I had this happen with a rock musician who was used to an on-stage setup.
* My set up is two mics/stands, an audio interface, and a laptop.
   * I can see the recording live in GarageBand as the conversation happens, so I’ve never had to worry about losing audio.
   * This also helps get the sound quality right in real time.
   * I have a preset GarageBand template that I use for all on location recordings.
* Turn off computer lockscreen/sleep mode. It’s unnerving when your screen saver starts in the middle of an interview.
* Close all applications on your computer, particularly browser tabs on Chrome, Firefox, etc., as they use a lot of memory.
   * Your computer fan will sound like background hissing if it runs.
   * Hissing is the enemy. Do everything you can to avoid it.
* I’m trying to make it nice, not perfect! Don’t obsess over minor differences in sound reproduction. Listeners won’t notice.
* Aim for good, reliable, and portable equipment. You don’t need expensive equipment.

**Conversation**

* There is a concept called “reciprocal self-disclosure.” Don’t expect people to bare their naked souls if you’re all clammed up.
* I am super available to guests. They have my email, phone number, and home address. (I contact most of my guest by handwritten letter.)
* I don’t call my episodes interviews. I am not a journalist. They are visits. To me that’s an important distinction.
* I tell guests before we begin that it’s great to ask me questions too.
* Notes should only be two single sided pages that you can lay out on the table in front of you so you’re not flipping pages on the recording, and your guest doesn’t feel like they’re being subjected to an interrogation.
* I write my notes in a notebook the night before. Then, I review them just before the podcast so I don’t have to refer to them too often during the show.

**Post-show:**

* SAVE the recording as soon as you press stop.
* Get a selfie. Set next steps.
* Send a handwritten thank you note after the show. (You already have their address.)
* It is an HONOR to visit with people. To me it’s what podcasting is all about!

**Pack**  
I use a 20L backpack, a brilliant design by Nashville Pack - The Cutaway 20L. Last year I said ""it's absolutely perfect,"" and I stand by that. Zero issues so far, still love it.

I met the Nashville Pack team at Trail Days, an annual event for Appalachian Trail thru-hikers. These guys are triple crowners[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking) having completed all three major trails in the US (AT, CDT, PCT) - multiple times. This pack stood that test.

This is a bulletproof roll-top pack with plenty extra stuff sack storage on the exterior. Aside from outside storage, my favorite feature is the unique shoulder straps. Built without any rigid foam, the straps conform to your shoulder shape. All-day comfort!

This pack has no zippers and no laptop sleeve. Why do I use a pack without quick access? I don't mind the few extra seconds it takes to open the roll-top. When I'm all packed up, I usually don't need to get inside the pack until I reach my destination. I can keep small stuff for quick access in the external storage, like a rain jacket or headphones.

This pack is completely waterproof, and the roll-top helps with added security. No need to carry my pack on my chest.

**Down jacket**  
The puffy, a crucial item for the lightweight traveler. The Decathlon Forclaz 100 is the best budget puffy on the market, a third of the price for a durable and functional down jacket.

I've worn it in the backcountry, traveled across a continent with it, and wear it daily at home. The warmth-to-weight ratio is outstanding. A down jacket is a must-have. I prefer one with a hood and pockets, but you can find some without.

In a cold climate destination, I might bring a thin canvas jacket too. I can toss it over top of a t-shirt or over my fleece, or to bundle up as an outer shell over the fleece and puffy.

**Rain jacket**  
I'm not paying top dollar for an ultralight rain shell. A nearly weightless piece of plastic shouldn't cost more than a good dinner. That's why I have a budget-friendly frogg toggs. This thing keeps me dry. It does its job, but you pay for what you get. It has no pockets, and it's not stylish. Not too durable either, but it has lasted me four years and counting. I prefer the oversized baggy build of this jacket, because I can wear warm layers underneath and still have wiggle room.

**Hoody/fleece**  
If I lost my pack, I'd be devastated to lose my Melanzana fleece hoody. It's traveled the world with me, kept me cozy in airplanes and on mountaintops. We've had a great run together, going on strong since I stumbled upon the secluded shop in Leadville, Colorado in 2018. I wear my Melly pretty much around the clock when the temps get chilly. I'll never leave home without my trusty mid-layer.

**Long-sleeve button-ups**  
I bring two. One is colorful, thin and breathable for warm weather. The other is black and slightly thicker material, but it's not a flannel. Both can be worn for a night out. When one needs a wash, I can wear the other one. No special brands, both were thrift finds.

**T-shirts**  
I carry three t-shirts and one short-sleeve collared shirt. All can be worn for a workout, or for casual. Cotton/poly blends. I thought maybe I would've made the switch to wool shirts by now, but I can't justify the price tag just yet. Doing laundry once a week doesn't bother me, but wool would cut back on that as it can be washed less often.

**Shorts**  
I bring two pairs on warm-weather trips. My main daily go-to is this black all-day style shorts by Abercrombie. These are versatile, good for any occasion. I can wear them during active exploration, or pair with a button-up for a clean look. I love the hidden zipper pocket too, where I keep my wallet, cash and locker key.

I prefer shorts with 5-inch inseam. I'm a short man (and I have nice legs), so short shorts is a better look for me than longer shorts that hover around the knees. I'd argue this looks better on almost any man. If you're still rockin long California-style boardshorts length or cargo shorts, consider making a switch.

The second pair is Anthem Athletics shorts, all black. I've been wearing these shorts for workouts for years. I love the deep zipper pockets, keeping my stuff secure. 7-inch inseam is an option for both of these shorts too.

**Pants**  
This decision depends on the climate. I bring one pair for warm-weather trips and a different pair for cold weather. Warm: thin nylon hiking pants by Kuhl that also look good enough to wear with a button-up. Cold: black jeans.

Anything I might need, I can find in my destinations. On longer trips, I won't pack winter clothes (besides a puffy and hoody) when I won't be in cold climates for the first few weeks of a trip. There's no sense in lugging around clothes I'll never wear for weeks at a time, so I'll buy what I need if I need it.

**Undies**  
I carry five pairs. They're easy to wash, and dry overnight. David Archy is the most comfortable I've ever had, been wearing them for years. They're made from a bamboo material that's soft and breathable. They dry fast in direct sunlight, but drying takes longer without sun.

**Socks**  
If you don't have wool socks, you're missing out. Wool keeps you warm when it's cold, and keeps you cool when it's hot. Wool dries quickly. Wool is naturally anti-odor, anti-bacterial. Throw away all of your cotton socks and replace them with wool. I can wear a single pair for two or three days before needing to switch to a clean pair.

I bring four pairs. I prefer a thinner lightweight over the thicker midweight hiking sock. I wear only crew socks, which goes above the ankle. Black socks only, that's my thing! Darn Tough makes the best socks I’ve ever had.

**Shoes**  
I bring one pair of shoes when I travel - the shoes on my feet. On my longest trip I wore the exact same pair of shoes for three months straight. They didn't smell great in the final week, but they kept my feet safe and happy.

The weight and space savings of having no shoes in my pack is a huge benefit. Shoes are bulky, heavy, annoying to pack. Avoid this at all costs if you can!

I made the switch from barefoot minimalist shoes to Altra Lone Peak trail runners for travel. The ""foot-shaped"" wide toe box is essential, and the Lone Peaks provide this with some additional cushion that a barefoot shoe lacks.

These shoes dry quickly if they get wet, and they have great traction. These are the primary shoe of choice for thru-hikers. My shoe choice is not a fashion statement, it's purely functional. There's nothing more important than keeping my feet happy when traveling.

I've never done this before, but I'm considering snagging a pair of super thin and lightweight sandals to shower with, for feet health.

**Belt**  
This decision is easy. I weigh the few belts I own and pick the lightest one. My leather belt looks good, but it's heavy. Nobody will notice or care about the style of belt you wear, so go light!

**Hats**  
I always carry a black nylon snapback cap. When the sun's out, I'm wearing this hat. It's easy to wash and dries quickly. But most importantly, it protects my face from sunburns, and it keeps the hair out of my face on windy days. I'd only bring a beanie if it was freezing cold in my destination.

**Buff**  
This amazing piece of fabric doubles as a scarf and an eye mask for sleep. Your neck or ears are cold? The buff keeps you warm. Sunlight waking you up? Buff is your blackout curtain. I found mine on sale at REI years ago. It's black, wool and has a few holes. I'll rock this thing til it dies. Everyone should have a wool buff.

**Bandana**  
A bandana is another versatile item that I always carry. Lately I've been rocking a red one, but the color might change from time to time. The bandana's many uses:

* keeps my neck protected from the sun
* adds color to my often-black wardrobe
* cleans sweat off my face or dirt off my hands
* wipes up coffee spills on a train or my runny nose in the cold

**Fanny pack**  
I love my hip-belt pack made by Waymark Gear Co. It's an odd shape compared to most packs, which makes it ideal for awkward rectangular-shaped items, like a Kindle. I'll bring it on a run to hold my phone, money, snacks or camera so they're not bouncing around in my pockets. But I don't carry it around 24/7 like the Euro bros do.

**Phone**  
I have the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Why do I love it? This phone unfolds to a larger screen like a tablet. It also has a standard front screen like a regular phone, only slightly more narrow.

Everything is better on the big screen - browsing, reading books, looking at travel photos and maps. Since it's basically two phones, the battery lasts twice as long. I can go a full 24 hours on one charge, sometimes longer.

Snag an eSIM online before you arrive, and you'll have service upon arrival in any country.

**Books**  
While I love my Kindle, I usually prefer to use my phone for books when I travel. It's rare for me to travel with paper books. I can't justify the weight when I can carry a library in my pocket that's always accessible.

**Laptop**  
Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11, 14in. The perfect combo of powerful and lightweight at only 2.5 pounds. A full pound lighter than a Macbook Pro, but I can still edit video on this thing. I keep it protected with a lightweight cushioned sleeve.

**Camera gear**  
The only camera I carry is the DJI Osmo Action 4. Along with the DJI Mic 2 pack, and a few extra batteries, my entire camera kit can fit in my fanny pack. For data storage, I use a Samsung SSD T7 shield hard drive, with a tiny memory card case and a USB-C card reader.

**Charging**  
Anker 65W charger can charge my phone, laptop and camera batteries at the same time. Mogics international power adapter, the smallest and most lightweight one you'll find. I use a hair tie to keep the charging block from falling out of the travel adapter.

**Earbuds**  
Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro. I've had these for almost two years now, and I finally understand the hype of earbuds. Tiny, can fit in my pocket, almost weightless, amazing audio quality. The noise canceling is good enough for flights and busy hostels. The only downside is buds can be easy to misplace, so train yourself to not be the type of person who loses things. Easy fix!

**Toiletries**  
No need to deep dive on what I carry, but I'll note a few things. My beard trimmer is designed for pets. It’s tiny, and powered by a single battery, which allows me to avoid carrying an additional charger.

A shampoo soap bar, a must-have, I always carry one. I use this amazing Matador pouch to keep it dry, clean and separate from everything else. I don’t know how they do it, but the dry-through tech really works.

My hair brush is lightweight, and not bulky. The Tangle Teezer thick & curly backs down to no tangle.

I might bring a few supplements like vitamins D3 and B12, and magnesium.

**Towel**  
I love my mini travel towel. Some hostels don’t provide towels, or charge a fee for use. The fee is usually insignificant, but why pay when I can bring one that's nearly weightless, packs down smaller than a candy bar and dries super fast? Soak with warm water & soap, rinse, and it’s clean in an instant. I like the loop for easy hang-dry. Made by PackTowl (hand size, 16 x 36 in).

**Ear plugs**  
The best sleep system, especially for hostels, is buff eye mask + ear plugs. It blows my mind that some travelers might overlook this. The best ear plugs are silicone, not foam (Mack's Pillowsoft). They won’t fall out in the middle of the night, and they block out more noise.

**Water bottle**  
I’d like to avoid drinking out of plastic, but for travel it’s too convenient. One liter of water by itself weighs 1kg or 2.2 pounds. Adding a full pound with a metal bottle is not worth it when plastic weighs only a few grams.

Even still, I try to avoid buying too many bottles. It’s a fun game for me to see how long I can make one bottle last before I toss it. I refill where it’s convenient, like water fountains, tap water when it’s safe, asking restaurant staff to fill my bottle.

**Passport**  
I don't use a travel belt, or have a secret system of securing my passport. I just treat it like any other valuable item, like my phone or wallet. Be careful with it, lock it up when necessary.

**Lock**  
I always take advantage of lockers at hostels. I never leave my pack sitting out in the room when I'm not there. I'll leave clothes hanging, leave the phone charger plugged in, but never my laptop or camera gear.

I prefer a lock with a key, rather than a combination. Fussing with a combo in the dark is no fun. Key is easy, and I won't lose a key.

**Small stuff**  
The Heroclip Mini is a unique little tool. Its basic function, a carabiner. Its second function, a hook with a rubber tip to hang over the top of a door, ledge, counter. Comes in handy in bathrooms when the wall hooks are missing or broken, and I need to hang my pack off the floor.

The Nitecore Tini 2 keychain flashlight is incredibly bright and lightweight. I carry it on a keychain with my locker key, and it helps on dark streets or hostel rooms.

My favorite budget sunglasses - the Goodr nine dollar pour-overs.

A small plastic baggie is an easy to way to keep tiny stuff in one place, like sim card, mini first aid kit, backup credit card and extra cash.

**Organization system**  
Travelers often make two mistakes - not having a storage system at all, or using too many packing cubes made from heavy material. The sacks and pouches I use are all extremely lightweight items. The minimal additional weight is worth it for ease of packing and unpacking. Organization is so important!

* 16L Granite Gear zipp sack for all my clothes
* Drawstring sack for socks & undies (fits inside the clothes sack)
* Basic toiletries bag
* Small pouch for small stuff (lock, charger, electronics, extra cash/cards)
* Ziploc plastic baggie for snacks
* Plastic bag for dirty laundry (from a hotel)
* Fanny pack for camera gear

Items that are stored loose inside my pack - puffy, melly and laptop. Items that are stored loose outside my pack - hat, rain jacket, mini towel, snacks baggie and water bottle. Everything else has a cozy home.

**Maybes**  
In my [travel pack video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ryTg3SPxY&t=125s) I included a handful of items not listed here that I might consider bringing depending on the type of trip.

**Rules**  
*I know I'm preaching to the choir here on this sub, but ... here's my rules for packing light.*

Rule #1 for packing light is to bring less stuff.

Rule #2 is be a gram weenie, an ounce shredder. What does that mean? Pretend that everything is heavy, get a countertop scale and weigh every item you pack. When choosing between two similar items, weigh them both and pick the lighter option. This is how you save weight!

Rule #3 is be okay with doing laundry, it takes just one hour once a week. This is how you can travel with one backpack and not need weeks worth of clothing. This simple trick is the key to traveling light.

Carry less, eliminate stress and go farther!

I ordered coffee and donuts from Dunkin'.

My order was marked as Leave at the Door, just like it always is.
The driver pulled a trifecta: he ignored my delivery instructions and therefore delivered the food to the wrong door, he didn't take a photo of where he dropped off the food (I didn't think it was possible to bypass the photo requirement, but apparently it is), and worst of all he pounded on the door, waking up everyone else in the house. This was at 5:50am!

This was so unexpected and seemingly aggressive that I decided not to open the door. I messaged him ""This order was LEAVE AT THE DOOR. Please just leave the food and stop pounding on the door!!! You woke up everybody else in the house. It's not even 6 o'clock in the morning dude!!!"" and he got the message. Instantly the screen saying the food had been delivered popped up, but with a generic graphic and no photo.

I rated him thumbs down and selected the buttons Didn't follow instructions, Delivered to the wrong place, and Unprofessional (there was no choice for ""driver pounded on my door for a Leave at the Door order"").

1i7bcqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i7bcqg/i_went_on_my_first_tinder_date_today_my_date/,I went on my first Tinder date today. My date showed up with her mouth sewn shut.,"The first thing I noticed was her short, blond curls. They made her blue eyes shine brighter somehow, and I found myself captivated by her beauty.



The second thing I noticed was the *stitches*.



Sophie pulled out her phone and typed something, then I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket.



**You must be Marcus! It’s great to finally meet in person! :D**



I thought about leaving, but only for a split second. When I saw the cheerful way she was looking at me, I thought, *What the hell!*



“Should we order something?” I asked, and Sophie nodded vigorously. 



We both got a small latte, I paid for our drinks, and we sat down. I awkwardly started sipping my coffee, but our short-lived silence was interrupted by another text.



**Question: what is your opinion on kissing on the first date?**



I looked up from my phone and Sophie was puffing out her lips.



I snorted. I couldn’t help it! She was funny!



**Ohmygod I’m so sorry, that was my horrible attempt at a joke!** 



“I’m sorry, I don’t know if I should text you back or just talk.”



**Whichever you prefer! :D**



I was nervous, so I started talking about myself. I was a nurse at a local hospital, something my friends teased me about endlessly until they saw how much money I made. I was born and raised in Des Moines. I loved traveling. Oh, and I haven’t been on a date in years. 



Maybe I shouldn’t have said that last part…



Sophie smiled and nodded attentively the whole time. She looked so fricken cute.



“Can I ask you something?”



**Of course! :D**



“Why a coffee shop if you can’t—” I pointed to my lips.



**I love the smell!**



That made sense. The shop *did* smell amazing.



**Besides! Who says I can’t enjoy coffee? I was just waiting for it to cool down.**



Sophie put her nose over her coffee cup, then sucked in like she was snorting a line.



I burst out laughing!



**Sorry! Another lame joke!**



But it wasn’t lame. In fact, this was the nicest date I’d ever been on. Would it be weird to tell her that?



Sophie and I talked for three amazing hours. I really didn’t want to leave, but I had a shift starting soon.



**Would it be awful to ask for a kiss before you go?**



“It won’t hurt, will it?”



Sophie shook her head.



I didn’t know why her lips were like that, but it didn’t bother me.



We leaned in, face to face, and I only hesitated for a second before Sophie grabbed the hair on the back of my head, pulling me in for our first kiss.



For a moment, the world stopped turning.



But when she pulled away something was wrong.



“Finally!” Sophie rejoiced.



I wanted to say something, but I couldn’t.



My mouth was sewn shut.



Sophie smiled a toothy grin.

I got hooked on the taste and easy of use, great macros, etc. I’ve had one literally every single day since then….

Somewhere in my mind I knew that protein shakes should be super clean during pregnancy but I sort of said…. It is what it is. I eat very balanced and tons of real protein , fiber, veggies, everything you’re supposed to. But I also drink coffee (around 2-250mg a day), eat cold cuts from reputable sources and have even had sushi on occasion (again from high end restaurants)

Now I’m wondering if I’ve been too cavalier about the protein shakes given all the talk of lead content. Should I consider having my blood tested? 

I’m coming to the end here and I guess it’s silly to start questioning my behaviors now bc the damage is already done if there is any. My pre birth anxiety is picking up and making me question everything I’ve done for the past 8 months.

1i7b7w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnFinnish/comments/1i7b7w3/app_idea_for_building_finnish_vocabulary/,app idea for building finnish vocabulary,"TLDR: Building a web app that generates Finnish sentences (with English & puhekieli translations) based on proficiency level and themes. Each word is clickable for detailed grammatical breakdown. The app tracks your vocabulary progress by marking words as known/learning/variation, includes spaced repetition flashcards, and audio features. Looking for feedback and suggestions.


Hey, I'm working on this idea to build an web app that will help with expanding Finnish vocabulary. I wanted to collect opinions and counter ideas from people.

Essentially, the app will generate sentence in Finnish and provide English and Puhekieli version with it. You can adjust parameters like your language level so it will go from A1, A2...C1,C2 and then you can also choose a set of predefined theme like ""buying coffee at the coffe shop"", ""ordering food in the restaurant"", ""interaction with cashier at the shop"" 

Other than AI generated sentences, you can also use Selkosuomeksi from Yle or just text you have pasted to practice.

Now, the interesting part: the app will provide breakdown of every word. So when you click a word in sentence it will give these information:

1. part of speech (noun, adjective)
2. base form (dictionary format)
3. stem (on which inflection is applied, if applied)
4. morpheme (the infection ending)
5. inflection type (illative, 3rd person pluarl present etc)
6.meaning in base form
7. meaning with inflection (and in sentence context)

Then, you can mark either the word as known or learning. These will be color coded. So at first all the words will be unknown and marked red, but next when you encounter a known word it will be marked green or blue if you're learning it. However, since Finnish has so many versions of every word because of inflection, there will be a 4th category, called variation. These are word with different inflection from the one you known or learning but has the same base form.
When you mark as known or learning, you get to edit any of the fields, so you can correct it if the AI generated part is erraneous.

All the known or learning words are stored. So you get to run through them in flash card mode with traditional spaces repetition. You can also directly add words like regular flashcard app. For words saved from ""practice"" mode, the sentence get added as an example. As the user marks enough word, the app will let the user generate sentence with more known or learning words that way the user has less unknown words and gets to see learning words in other context. 

With everything, you have the option to play audio. I will try to implement some sort of pronunciation checker in the flashcard mode too, so the user has more interactivity. 

Please let me know your suggestions and improvements. Thanks very much if you read it through.

Now, I'm pretty sure the title is clear enough, but I know Vyvanse is working, my focus is amazing! Just on the wrong things? 

For example, I ""recently"" moved homes (4 months ago) and when we organised the kitchen in the first weeks, we honestly did it horribly wrong. Oven trays far from the oven,
coffee machine *IN* a cabinet because
things were laying around, different kinds of plates all stacked together, etc... Everything where it *SHOULDN'T* be. But I didn't care really, that is, until before yesterday. I reorganised the *WHOLE* kitchen. I didn't even struggle one bit?? I didn't feel annoyed, I wasn't thinking about how I could be doing something I enjoyed instead, no, I just did it in a total of 6 hours (impressive if you knew the amount of things I moved around and the size of the kitchen).  

Another example, *THIS*. I usually *HATE* writing, no matter if its on paper or on a device. I hate it, I get bored and I suck at expressing how I feel or what I think. But now, these days I've spent *SO* much time on reddit, writing paragraphs for literally no reason other than the motivation to help others or ask questions. 

These aren't bad things! But it's just that, I'm a horrible student and I need to get my sh!t together, I've to learn how to study (at the embarrassing age of 18) and I've to finish school to study what I truly feel a passion for! 

Has anyone got any tips or advice on how they redirect their motivation to the ""right"" things? I feel like its important to mention that I don't mean to say that I want to be a studying robot for 12 hours a day, but I need to study at least 2 hours daily (studying even 5 minutes would be a miracle)!

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I'll take any kind of advice! Even things you think are useful to yourself when you study or used to study! I mainly want to know how to direct the motivation though, cause if I can do that then I'll be a studying machine!

I ate nothing day before prep but drank water, ginger beer, coffee, coke and sucked on wethers caramels and boiled sweets.
I was sedated for the procedure, but not asleep. It took 20 minutes. My colon was super clear from the prep. Doctors found 3 internal haemorrhoids and diverticulosis. He banded the piles there and then and told me to change diet to high fibre.

1i7b34v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1i7b34v/nightmare_neighbors/,Nightmare neighbors,"
We moved into our apartment four months ago. It’s a new Emaar building in a great area. When we moved in, our neighbors had two coffee tables in the hallway. At first, I didn’t think much of it, assuming they were also settling in since it’s a new building.

However, weeks went by, and the tables became a nuisance. They were placed right outside my door, and delivery drivers started leaving my packages on top of them. The neighbors also began using the tables to store all kinds of things rubbish, furniture, cleaning supplies, pots, pans, and more.

I complained to security multiple times, but nothing was done. It took 17 complaints to security, two official complaints, and one threat to involve the police before the tables were finally removed. This was three months of dealing with an obstructed entrance to my apartment every day.

Once the hallway was finally cleared, it didn’t even last two days before more items appeared—a vacuum cleaner and a dustpan and brush—placed right in front of my door. I moved them back to their side, but when I returned home from work, the items were back in front of my door again. I moved them to the side of their door, and they’ve stayed there ever since—this was over a month ago.

Now, they’ve escalated further. They’ve started leaving open black rubbish bags outside their door—smelly, uncovered, and likely expecting someone to throw them away. There are also three massive packs of 2-liter water bottles that have been sitting outside their door for over two weeks.

I finally had enough and submitted an official complaint to Emaar, including all the photo evidence I’ve collected. This was about a week ago, and since then, I’ve started receiving bogus complaints from security, clearly retaliatory.

Here’s what’s happened so far:
	1.	A complaint accusing us of smoking indoors (we’re both non-smokers).
	2.	A claim that our dog was barking all night on the balcony (we don’t even own a dog).
	3.	An accusation of having an open fire on the balcony (completely false).
	4.	A complaint about lights on our balcony (fairy lights that are battery-powered and barely bright). I removed them just to avoid further issues.
	5.	Today, we got a call accusing us of hosting a party in our apartment (also untrue).

It’s exhausting. Security even told me that my neighbors, two young women (likely 23-27 years old), are being allowed to get away with this behavior because of their background (they’re Middle Eastern). Meanwhile, I feel unheard and disrespected.

We’re paying over 200k AED a year to live here—I shouldn’t feel like I’m in a petty university housing situation, fighting over basic cleanliness and community rules.

Does anyone have advice? I feel like I’ve done everything I can, but this situation just keeps escalating. Thank you in advance—and sorry for the rant. I just needed to get this off my chest!",18,1737552476.0,dubai,35,0.91,False

So I’m back at the gym, curious to see if yesterday’s awkwardness between Mr. Serious and Mr. Shadow would continue. But today was different. Shadow was waiting near the water fountain, looking like he had been rehearsing a speech.

As soon as Serious walked in, Shadow blurted, “Bro, sorry about yesterday. I wasn’t trying to be weird… I just don’t know much about workouts, and you seem like you do. Can you help me?”

Serious raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed, but eventually sighed and said, “Fine. First, learn proper form. Second, stop lifting heavy weights if you don’t know how.”

To my surprise, they actually worked out together. By the end, they were cracking jokes and even fist-bumping between sets. As they were leaving, Shadow hesitantly asked, “Wanna grab some coffee? Maybe you could sha,re a few more tips?”

Serious shrugged and said, “Sure.”

And just like that, what started as gym-stalking turned into gym-bonding. From rivals to bros over coffee—who saw that coming?

I wouldn’t say I’m a line cook, but I do work at a breakfast and coffee joint. Not a big chain. We cook our own eggs and bacon, make sauces in house. Every morning I crack 216 eggs. I chop veggies. Use the scary mandolin. We’ve got convection ovens. No standard ovens, no fryer. It’s definitely a step above fast food, but certainly not the sort of kitchen I’d assume most folks here work in. Apologies! Don’t know where else to take my question. 

The kitchen is silent. Well, it isn’t silent. There is actually just 0 communication about the orders, the food we’re making. Anything work related. We have tickets, I come from a fast food background and am spoiled by the KVS monitors. The shelf the tickets hang on extends only above the first 1/4 of the line. They never get slid down by the person who is standing in front of them. 

There is not enough room between the line, and the table behind myself and other kitchen people where napkins, bags, and dishware are for me to even squeeze by the person blocking all the tickets from view, without walking all the way around the table behind us, to the other side of the room. I’m a pretty small guy, too. 

There are 0 set positions, everybody just kinda moves around and does whatever. Causes a lot of bumping into each other, doubly making items, and I feel I’m spending way too much time just pacing back and forth, trying to see these tickets. 

Is this NORMAL? Is it normal for everybody to hog the tickets, to never CALL the ticket out loud? I’m definitely out of my element. Slapped together tacos for 6 years. Managed a fast food joint. I just feel like this is crazy ineffective, and abnormal for most kitchens. We’re doing ok, just feel we could certainly do BETTER and wanted some input. Any and all comments are welcome!

Pictures 1 - 6 are the room as is. 

For the left hand wall we are thinking:
Black bookshelf and base units to the left of the chimney breast. I'm thinking IKEA hack with some trim added to keep costs low. This is to include some lamps / LEDs as well. Black chimney breast with round / oval mirror and some nicer decor on top of the fireplace surround. Acoustic panelling on the wall to the right of the chimney breast with a low TV console in dark wood with TV and audio system. 

The back (window wall). Colour to be confirmed but we're thinking either continue with the black from the chimney breast or a stone colour. Add curtains from the ceiling for texture and colour. Rich orange / brown tones. To the right of the window, add some shelves for plants and decor. Pull the sofa away from that wall slightly and add a lamp in the corner. Change radiator to something nicer, a traditional radiator, colour tbc. 

Right hand wall: get rid of the photo gallery and add one or two big art pieces. Colour to be the stone colour described above. 

Wall into kitchen. Add double doors as shown in one of the pictures. 

Floor: change to straight plank laminate floor in same colour as kitchen floor. We have this already so just need to be laid. Add rug. Change coffee table to something not as big. A set of 3 round nesting tables maybe.

Ceiling: Change light to something warmer. I like pic 13 but might not be practical as it hangs quite low. ",3,1737551637.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

For context - I work hybrid and was giving a virtual presentation to my direct manager and senior manager (both men in their 40s) about our website redesign project. 

During the presentation, my FWB's messages started popping up on screen with some very explicit content about wanting to hook up. I quickly turned off screen sharing, but there was this awful silence and they definitely saw the messages.

I tried to continue the presentation professionally, but the atmosphere was obviously awkward. My direct manager cleared his throat and seemed uncomfortable, while the senior manager suddenly became very interested in his coffee mug.

After the disaster, I checked my astrology app called starrybook (yes, I know some might find this silly, but it helps me process things), and it literally said ""Be cautious with digital communications today."" The irony is killing me, but right now I have much bigger problems to deal with.

Here's my situation:

* This was an important presentation about a project I'm hoping to lead
* I have to see both of them in person tomorrow at our weekly team meeting
* I'm usually very professional and have built good work relationships with both them
* We have a relatively casual office culture, but this feels like it crossed a line
* I'm torn between just owning up to the mistake or hoping everyone just forgets about it

2. Should I address it directly or pretend it never happened?
3. Will this affect my professional reputation? Be honest.

1i7ar80,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i7ar80/my_life_is_great_but/,My life is great but,"It snowed over 5 inches here in FL yesterday, a “once in a lifetime” event. I’ve learned my house is not made for this weather as the waterline to my hotwater heater has apparently frozen because snow blew into cracks in the wall and caused a circuit to fail causing its heater to fail allowing the waterline feeding it to fail. I hope it is not damaged but it sucked to not take a hot shower after a day of being frigid.

Also our insulation sucks because my bedroom was fucking freezing though the heater blew all through night so I doubled up blankets making me simultaneously sweat and freeze at the same time. 4:34am came and my old man bladder, combined with my fever like temperature swings, along with my CPAP machine gurgling then dripping condensing water up my nose meant my time for dreaming is over.

Here I sit again, in a cold ass room, with my cat who really wants to play, contemplating life and waiting for a sunrise that will include never seen before snow covered sand dunes and frozen sea oats.

I've lived a good life so far. I'm around my halfway mark and I guess it’s cliché to spend time simultaneously navel gazing, spending time in memories, and fearing for the future but here I am doing that more and more every day. How’s it going to end for me? Did I do enough yet? Was it meaningful? Does it matter?

My memories are overwhelmingly good. I’ve done a lot and enjoyed enough happiness and love for a lifetime already. I suppose I should be happy enough with the knowledge that worse times ahead would still end with a happy life on average. I’m feeling very nihilistic though. I used to almost breath optimism and happiness with the certainty that even in my own life the down times would pass and joy would return. ‘This too shall pass’ was my refuge and hope.

I long ago shed silly ideas of universal morality and deities keeping tally of rights and wrongs but even that understanding of the world was and is still limited by my own little world. I had humanity to put my faith in. I saw hope in the individual’s desperation to stay alive, and people’s curiosity and drive to discover and wield the world to their advantage.  I’ve grown jaded of late though and those same virtues I saw now seem like vices.  More than that even, they are immutable human flaws that ultimately, and seemingly, repeatably, lead to mass suffering through fear and greed. Those same people who believe they are acting out of love for mankind and hope for a better future, regularly justify the worst atrocities against the *other de jour*.

The sun is up now, just a little. I stopped to get some coffee and to watch the steam rising off the ocean as the sky went through the shades of the rainbow, green-blue then red-orange, as the thousand dancing tendrils of vapor rose from the gulf into the frozen air. I could see hundreds of birds floating on the water. Damn, how can they handle this cold? A bit of the low clouds on the horizon lit up like the color of bubblegum, then hot pink, before the fat orange sun peaked over the water. The birds flew up and the countless little twists of steam merged into a low fog speckled with black dots like pepper on gravy. What a lame ass image, but its pretty neat.

Anyway, I’m depressed and cold this morning. I’m tired but not sleepy. The world is full of morons and suckers who make me sad. At least the sunrise was nice.",1,1737551429.0,rant,0,1.0,False

1i7aqo6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7aqo6,Can somebody help me sketch up some ideas?,"Following a post a couple of weeks ago I went away to look at ideas that had been suggested. 

Here's what I've got so far, please can somebody help me sketch this up so I can visualise?


Pictures 1 - 6 are the room as is. 

For the left hand wall we are thinking:
Black bookshelf and base units to the left of the chimney breast. I'm thinking IKEA hack with some trim added to keep costs low. This is to include some lamps / LEDs as well. Black chimney breast with round / oval mirror and some nicer decor on top of the fireplace surround. Acoustic panelling on the wall to the right of the chimney breast with a low TV console in dark wood with TV and audio system. 

The back (window wall). Colour to be confirmed but we're thinking either continue with the black from the chimney breast or a stone colour. Add curtains from the ceiling for texture and colour. Rich orange / brown tones. To the right of the window, add some shelves for plants and decor. Pull the sofa away from that wall slightly and add a lamp in the corner. Change radiator to something nicer, a traditional radiator, colour tbc. 

Right hand wall: get rid of the photo gallery and add one or two big art pieces. Colour to be the stone colour described above. 

Wall into kitchen. Add double doors as shown in picture 11. 

Floor: change to straight plank laminate floor in same colour as kitchen floor. We have this already so just need to be laid. Add rug. Change coffee table to something not as big. A set of 3 round nesting tables maybe (pictures 15).

Ceiling: Change light to something warmer. I like pic 15 but might not be practical as it hangs quite low. ",3,1737551383.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False
1i7aq83,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1i7aq83/feeling_down_today/,Feeling down today,"Mild Trigger Warning: mention of suicidal ideations. 

Hi all,

Just need to get my feelings out into the universe. Started taking Mirtazapine nearly 2 months ago for my mood dysregulation and sleep problems. It worked like magic for first 3ish weeks but I’m back to square one. 


I stopped drinking coffee and started taking the meds at 8:30/9pm instead of the usual 10pm when I’ve noticed it wasn’t helping me much. I’m still wide awake at 2/3am. 


Also, my mood swings are still horrendous. Past 2 weeks have been really bad. I feel so depressed, stopped taking care of myself and everyday I’m convinced something bad will happen to me. Im in this hole of not wanting to exist anymore and I don’t have the energy to dig myself out of it. I don’t want to die I just want everything to stop.


I think I’m due on my period soon, I’m on the implant so it’s a 50/50 chance if I get it or not but I’ve been cramping up for 3 days now. 


I have a telephone appointment soon which is pretty good timing. Last time Ive seen my mental health nurse I was much happier so she didn’t really see how my brain likes to flip on me. 


Anyways sorry for a long rant just needed to get things off my chest.

These once-delicate blades of grass, so fine they seemed almost ethereal, are now thickening in diameter. Along their shoots, a distinct kink marks where this transformation begins.

In the world of monocots like green onions, their leaves grow in a tubular, cylindrical fashion. The kink and thicker diameter below it reveal the plant’s dynamic growth process—new leaves are forming inside the older ones and pushing upward. That little kink isn’t a flaw; it’s a sign of life, energy, and progress as the plant stretches toward its full potential. It’s a beautiful reminder that growth isn’t always linear or smooth; sometimes, it’s marked by bends and breaks that tell a story of resilience and transformation.

Every morning, my garden teaches me something new about patience, persistence, and the quiet miracles unfolding right in front of me.

So I have a disability that makes me clumsy, and unfortunately also messes with my working memory. 

This means that I am both clumsier AND more forgetful than the average person, meaning no amount of ""just be careful"" will work.

I would like to protect my new laptop to the best of my ability. I've recently read that apparently screen protectors can damage the screen, and cases for the outside can damage the laptop over time due to messing with heat dissapation, and keyboard protectors can damage the screen if you close it with it still on.

So what is left? It seems unreasonable to me that for my phone I can buy an otterbox case and make it nearly indestructible but my laptop has to be completely naked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, home and kitchen appliances play an essential role in shaping modern living. With advancements in technology, these appliances have become more than just tools; they are now integrated parts of our daily lives, making tasks simpler and more efficient. Let’s explore how innovative home and kitchen appliances enhance our living experience.

### The Convenience Factor

One of the main benefits of modern home and kitchen appliances is convenience. Imagine coming home from a long day at work to find that your smart oven has already preheated for your dinner. With appliances like programmable coffee makers and smart dishwashers, everyday tasks can be automated, reducing the time spent in the kitchen.

- **Smart Refrigerators:** These can monitor your food inventory, suggest recipes, and even create shopping lists.
- **Instant Pots:** A perfect example of multitasking, combining a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, and more into one device.
- **Robot Vacuums:** Keep your floors clean without lifting a finger, allowing you more time for relaxation.

### Energy Efficiency

Modern appliances are designed to save energy, which is not only better for the environment but also beneficial for your wallet. High Energy Star-rated appliances consume less electricity and water, helping you save on utility bills. For example, energy-efficient washing machines use significantly less water compared to older models, making laundry day more eco-friendly.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
Consider upgrading to appliances that provide energy-saving options, such as:

- **LED Lighting:** Many new appliances come with built-in LED lighting, which uses less power.
- **Smart Thermostats:** These adjust your home’s temperature based on your habits, optimizing energy consumption.
- **Induction Cooktops:** They heat up quickly and use less energy than traditional gas or electric stoves.

### Space Optimization

With urban living spaces shrinking, efficient use of space has become critical. Innovative appliances address this need by maximizing functionality without consuming excessive space. For instance, compact dishwashers that fit under counters or stackable washer-dryer combinations allow you to make the most of your available area.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
Choose multifunctional devices that serve multiple purposes. For example:

- **Air Fryers:** Fry, bake, and roast your favorite foods all in one appliance.
- **Blender-Food Processor Combos:** Save counter space with appliances that perform both functions.
- **Microwave-Convection Ovens:** Enjoy the benefits of convection cooking along with microwave heating.

### Enhancing Health and Wellness

Health plays a vital role in our lives, and modern appliances contribute significantly to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Appliances like juicers, blenders, and food processors encourage the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. By making it easy to prepare healthy meals at home, these devices can help you stick to dietary goals.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
Additionally, air purifiers and water filtration systems ensure that your family breathes clean air and drinks safe water, thus promoting better overall health.

### Smart Technology Integration

Today’s appliances can be connected to the internet, providing a level of control and monitoring that previous generations could only dream of. You can now manage your home appliances from your smartphone or voice-activated devices like Google Home and Amazon Alexa. This level of integration leads to a more streamlined living experience.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- **Remote Access:** Start your laundry or adjust the thermostat from wherever you are.
- **Smart Cooktops:** Receive alerts and cooking tips directly on your phone.
- **Safety Features:** Smart appliances can alert you of potential issues, such as doors left ajar or leaks, enhancing safety.

Innovative home and kitchen appliances into your lifestyle not only simplifies daily activities but also significantly improves quality of life. As technology continues to advance, these appliances will further evolve, adapting to meet your changing needs. Embracing this innovation leads to smarter, healthier, and more harmonious living environments, making appliance investment worthwhile for every household.

Essential Considerations When Choosing Energy-Efficient Kitchen Gadgets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to choosing gadgets for your home and kitchen, energy efficiency is a crucial factor. With rising energy costs and an increasing concern for the environment, finding energy-efficient kitchen appliances can aid both your wallet and the planet. Here are key considerations to keep in mind when selecting energy-efficient kitchen gadgets.

### Understand Energy Star Ratings

Energy Star is a program backed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that helps you identify energy-efficient products. Kitchen gadgets that carry the Energy Star label mean they meet strict energy efficiency guidelines. Here are some common appliances with Energy Star ratings:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- Refrigerators
- Dishwashers
- Ovens
- Microwaves

When shopping, look for this label to ensure you’re selecting the most energy-efficient products available.

### Assess Your Cooking Habits

Your cooking style significantly impacts the energy use of appliances. If you love baking, consider high-efficiency ovens or convection models that use less energy by circulating hot air. For frequent boiling or steaming, an induction cooktop can offer faster heating and less wasted energy. Ask yourself:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- Do you cook large meals often?
- Do you prefer quick reheating options?
- What types of food do you prepare most often?

Understanding your cooking habits will guide you in selecting appliances that suit your needs while conserving energy.

### Consider Appliance Size

Before investing in a new kitchen gadget, consider how much space you have and how often you will use it. Larger appliances can consume more energy, but smaller options might not meet your demands. Strive for a balance:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- Choose a refrigerator that matches your family size.
- Evaluate whether you need a full-size oven versus a smaller countertop option.

By selecting appropriately sized appliances, you can avoid wasting energy on underutilized machines.

### Review Energy Consumption Estimates

Each appliance has an energy consumption estimate provided by the manufacturer, usually shown in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Comparing these estimates can help you make informed choices. Higher efficiency appliances may cost more upfront but can save you significantly on your electric bill in the long run. Look for:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- The estimated yearly energy costs
- How energy-efficient the model is compared to similar gadgets

Not only will this aid in immediate budgeting, but it will also help you understand long-term savings and environmental impact.

### Prioritize Multi-functional Appliances

Opting for multi-functional kitchen gadgets can save not only space but also energy. For instance, a microwave that doubles as a convection oven takes up less room and may use less energy when cooking meals rather than heating up a full-size oven. Some effective multi-functional appliances include:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- Pressure cookers that can slow cook, steam, and sauté
- Blenders that can also serve as food processors
- Toaster ovens that can bake, toast, and reheat

Choosing gadgets that do multiple tasks can reduce the number of devices you own, leading to more energy-efficient cooking.

### Check for User Reviews

Before making a purchase, it’s wise to check user reviews. Customers often share their experiences about the energy efficiency of a product. Look for comments on:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- How much energy the appliance actually uses
- Durability and functionality over time
- Any issues related to energy consumption

Using feedback from others can give you insights that aren’t always available in product descriptions.

### Monitor Your Energy Use

Once you've made your purchases, consider using smart plugs or energy monitors to track how much electricity each appliance is consuming. By monitoring your energy use, you can adjust your habits and make informed choices in the future. Some benefits include:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-appliances  
  
- Identifying high energy-consuming appliances
- Making changes to reduce overall energy consumption

Keeping an eye on your usage may also prompt you to replace appliances that are no longer efficient.

Choosing energy-efficient kitchen gadgets is not just about making environmentally conscious decisions; it’s also about saving money and optimizing your cooking experience. By focusing on energy ratings, your cooking habits, and user feedback, you’re well on your way to a more sustainable kitchen.

### Conclusion

Understanding the impact of innovative home and kitchen appliances on modern living goes beyond mere convenience. These gadgets play a pivotal role in enhancing our lifestyles, making daily tasks easier and more enjoyable. From smart refrigerators that help you plan your meals to high-tech blenders that save time and effort, the right appliances can transform your kitchen into a hub of creativity and efficiency.

Let’s call her Barbara. Barbara is the kind of person who always has a fully packed-out social calendar. At times she will even have things planned 2-3 months in advance. She also needs for there to be a plan/booking/reservation in place for everything which has to be communicated to her in advance otherwise she will start getting annoyed/anxious. Even meeting for a simple coffee or grabbing a drink after work requires research, a plan and a booking. I, on the other hand, am not like this and am quite laid back and like to go with the flow. The most I will plan in advance is a couple of weeks. For context, we both live in a big city, so I totally understand that certain things require a reservation or booking ahead of time. However, I also know that it is possible to have a fun time out without a set plan.

 

When Barbara goes out, she wants to go OUT. It is never a simple coffee or lunch but an entire day of coffee, followed by a movie, dinner then drinks etc. Initially I really appreciated how organised Barbara was as we did go out and do a lot of fun things together, however, over the last year or so, I have started to feel the strain. I also recognise that because I am content to make things up as I am going along, Barbara ends up doing a lot of the planning and that this isn’t fair to her. Whenever I have tried to jump in with planning things to do, I have noticed that Barbara usually ends up complaining and nitpicking, so I guess on some subconscious level, maybe I have let her crack on with organising the nights out as at least that way I know she won’t complain.

 

I have also started to feel the strain of texting Barbara regularly. She tends to send multiple extremely lengthy messages and there have been times when I have not wanted to respond as I know that it will require an equally lengthy reply which I can’t always be bothered with. She has at times gotten upset if I do not reply for a few days and has even gone as far as cancelling our weekend plans at times and then messaging me to say “I have cancelled because as you know you’re not good at replying and I don’t have the energy to chase”. I find this to be passive aggressive and like I am being told off for taking too long to reply.

 

Fast forward to this past year, I have been dealing with a lot of personal issues (work harassment, death in the family, illness, financial issues). It has been a very difficult year for me, and I have at times become withdrawn and not wanted to talk much or go out and plan much. Barbara has called me out on this, and I had told her that it is not personal but it is just my coping mechanism when I feel life is overwhelming me. She responded by saying that she doesn’t want us to miss out on doing fun things with the subtext being that I don’t plan enough.

 

A couple of months ago, a family member of mine was in hospital in palliative care. This was a very upsetting time for me and preoccupied a lot of my thoughts and time. Barbara texted me to check up on me and then the day after this interaction, I woke up to an 11-minute voice note (yes, 11 minutes) Barbara had sent me at 1am. She basically dug me out saying that the last two conversations I hadn’t bothered to ask her how she was doing, said that she didn’t want a one-sided friendship, and said that she’s amazing and knows her worth and that if I don’t want to be her friend I should just say so. This completely threw me so I replied along the lines of how I thought some of what she said was completely uncalled for given my circumstances and that just because I’m silent and not making plans isn’t an indication that I don’t want to be friends anymore.

 

Barbara replied apologising for upsetting me and saying that maybe things came across the wrong way in the voice note. She said she had been dealing with a lot personally and that for the sake of avoiding further misunderstandings she thought it best to take some space. I told her I understood her need for space, apologised if I had said or done anything upsetting to her lately, told her I appreciated the friendship and that I was there for her when she felt ready to talk. That was two months ago and I haven’t heard from her since. I haven’t reached out either as I was grieving a death in the family and trying to get myself sorted. I now thought to reach out to Barbara to invite her for a coffee and a catch up and saw that she has deleted me off Whatsapp.

 

This has also thrown me as Barbara prides herself on being emotionally intelligent and aware and I would have thought that seeing how we left things on goodish terms, she would have at least had a conversation with me. I have noticed that Barbara has a tendency to write people off when she feels like they are not there for her enough by her standards. In the two years I have known her, she has cut off 3 friends and several men she was dating. I also feel like she starts spiralling when people become more focused on themselves e.g. she cut off a friend who was about to become a single mum and wasn’t by Barbara’s standards there for her enough, another friend moved to another country to be with her partner and Barbara deemed her to be a cop-out who chooses a man over friendship and cut her off, the guy she was dating was working a full time job and studying for a degree in his spare time and she would complain that he wasn’t making enough time for her.

 

So my question is, given how I have been very focused on my own problems this past year, AITAH for not making more time for her and checking in on her enough and not making enough plans?

Hey everyone,

I’ve been doing some research on ways to support skin healing, particularly around sensitive areas like hemorrhoids, and I came across something that might be helpful: collagen.

Collagen is a protein that plays a big role in maintaining skin elasticity, hydration, and overall health. It’s essential for wound healing, and it helps strengthen the skin barrier—qualities that can be beneficial for improving the delicate skin around hemorrhoids.

Here’s how collagen might help:
	1.	Promotes Skin Repair: Collagen provides amino acids that the body uses to rebuild damaged tissue, which is especially important for areas experiencing irritation or inflammation.
	2.	Enhances Elasticity: The skin around hemorrhoids can sometimes feel stretched or fragile. Collagen supports elasticity, which may help the skin recover and resist further damage.
	3.	Hydration Support: Collagen can improve the skin’s moisture retention, which may alleviate dryness or discomfort in the area.
	4.	Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Some studies suggest that collagen supplements might help reduce inflammation, which could ease some symptoms of hemorrhoids.

You can add collagen to your diet through:
	•	Supplements: Hydrolyzed collagen powder is easy to mix into water, coffee, or smoothies.
	•	Food Sources: Bone broth, fish skin, chicken skin, and other collagen-rich foods.

While collagen isn’t a direct treatment for hemorrhoids, I believe it can be a supportive addition to your routine alongside traditional remedies like fiber-rich diets, hydration, and proper hygiene.

Have you tried collagen for skin health or hemorrhoid relief? I’d love to hear your experiences or thoughts. Let’s share and learn together!

# Background

This was my fifth marathon. I ran my first in 2021 and have done 1/year since then (Philly, Chicago, NYC, and Shamrock respectively), with the goal always being Boston entry. I qualified for Boston once in 2022, 2023, and 2024 (both counted for Boston 2025) but did not gain entry due to the time cutoff. My main goal for Houston was a BIG BQ to hopefully secure my spot.

# Training

I have been slowly adding mileage to my training blocks each time, but still tend to be a lower-milage marathoner due to injuries and a love of strength training. With the new Boston Qualifying standards (and turning 35) I realistically wanted to hit 3:20:00 or better to avoid a 3rd time cutoff rejection. This was a big, big goal for me - I ran a 3:29:XX last March, and my PR was a high 3:28:XX. The past couple of races, I always felt like I left a better time on the table due to nutrition/fueling issues, a hot day, injury, etc. - all lessons I was going to take with me to this race. I decided I had nothing to lose and accepted the potential of a miserable race/major bonk/even a DNF and structured my training based on this goal. 

I followed a modified Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 and extended some of the midweek long runs and weekend long runs to hit more 40 and 50-mile weeks. I also strength trained 4x a week, with 3/5 days doubling up running with strength. I went into this block with a better base than usual as well, having run consistently all summer hitting 20-30 mile weeks along with my normal gym routine. Of note, I also started running with a local run club and this led to a smaller group of us doing long weekend runs together. I think having a running community (and more ""yap pace"" runs) helped with base building. 

All was going to plan for the first 12 weeks of my 18 week block. I treated each Saturday long run like a race day dress rehearsal - early wake up, the same oatmeal + banana breakfast with coffee and water, and Maurten fuel every 30 min / 4-ish miles. I even achieved a huge, 3+ min half marathon PR of 1:30:30 right before Thanksgiving. Then, injury struck following a 15 mile long run during week 12. I had intense outer calf pain/tightness that made it hard to even walk and I knew something was wrong. Saw a doctor and was diagnosed with Peroneal Tendonitis, and was given PT exercises and an anti-inflammatory. I was also advised to lay off running for atleast a week, but I was able to cycle 3X that week. Doubt started to creep in - with this missed mileage, did I need to adjust my goal?

I picked back up week 14 doing 4/5 runs and 26/40 scheduled miles, adding in an elliptical session. I structured the final weeks of my training this way to avoid further aggravation of my calf - 2 shorter runs, 1 speed session (tempo building to race pace, and one 45-90 min elliptical during the week, then whatever I could manage for my Saturday long run. I only ended up hitting 1 of my 3 scheduled 50 mile weeks which was a blow to my confidence - I felt like I wasn't putting the work in needed to hit my goal. Week 15 was supposed to be my final 20 miler and I managed to get 18 done without irritating my calf too much and was over the moon. I had adjusted the best I possibly could and felt I maximized my training without making my injury worse. 

# Pre-race

I did my normal 3-day carb load using the Featherstone Nutrition calculator: [https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/carb-loading/](https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/carb-loading/). Orange gatorade and pop tarts remain the staples I love to hate. 

Arrived to Houston the Friday before race day and was able to bop around the expo and pick my packet up. I wanted to stay off of my feet as much as possible on Saturday, except for a small 2 mile shakeout, and brought a new book to ensure I had something to keep me occupied (thanks ACOTAR). 

Race outfit planning was a challenge - it was supposed to be cold for race day. Temps in the low/mid 30's but high teens feel with windchill added. I had never raced in temps this cold before and debated what to wear, knowing there was a fine line between not wearing enough and wasting energy keeping warm or wearing too much and overheating/sweat making me cold. Ultimately decided on shorts, long sleeve sweat-wicking shirt, baseball cap, ear warmers, and gloves. I also packed a disposable heat sheet and throwaway sweatpants and sweatshirt. The joke is on me for the heat sheet - it was ripped to shreds by the wind just walking to the starting area! That said, it honestly didn't feel that cold - I trained in way worse cold/wind conditions in the mid-Atlantic and I think it prepared me. 

I arrived at the starting corral just in time (I underestimated how far it was from the convention center and had to break into a little run before they locked the gates!). I found the 3:20:00 pace group and planned on sticking with them for the first 10 miles or to avoid starting too fast and fizzling out. The nerves had set in Friday and Saturday but a friend reminded me that being nervous just means I care and I needed to trust that I could do it. I clung to this mindset and told myself it was my day and I owed it to myself to give it my all. Approaching that start line, I was excited, grateful, a little jittery.

Race

This course was so fast and flat. It felt like it was mostly downhill. My adrenaline was pumping and I had to keep reminding myself to keep it controlled and smart for the first 3 miles or so before settling into a 7:30-ish pace. I stuck with the pace group until mile 7-8ish then slowly started to pull away. I would pump the brakes and see them behind me, then would start to speed up again. Once I made it to 10, I started to speed up even more and tried my best to stay present, taking each mile at a time and focusing on staying steady. In the past, I have pulled ahead of pace groups only to be passed by them later and didn't want that to happen. 

The wind was doing its thing but it would come and pass quickly. At times, it was warm in the sun, but once the shade or wind took over it stayed cool again. I never really got too hot and barely broke a sweat which was a new race experience for me. I did still grap 1 sip of water and 1 sip or so of gatorade at almost every aid station. I also took my gels as planned - Maurten 100 every 4 miles / 30 minutes or so. I brought 6 and dropped one at mile 20 (oops!) but figured I had taken down enough carbs and if I kept taking sips of gatorade at each aid station I'd be okay. 

Once I hit mile 15 or so and was splitting well ahead of 3:20:00 pace I started to get cautiously optimistic that I was going to pull this off, maybe even beating 3:20:00 as long as I didn't slow down much. I prayed, took in the crowds, enjoyed my playlist, etc. By mile 18/19 I was on cloud 9 - so happy, running faster and feeling strong, blocking out the pain and tightness building in my quads and glutes. I was smiling and making small breathless chitchat with other runners out there. My fastest mile was mile 21 and I wasn't even that fussed when someone accidentally dumped gatorade all over the backs of my legs, leaving a sticky, tacky mess. 

I ignored my watch and pace band and just vibed. Today was my day - I wasn't there yet but I could taste that big PR coming. I barely felt the wind as we got back downtown, around mile 23/24. Saw my husband at mile 25 and in all the pictures he took I am grinning. Finally stole a glance at my watch when I hit mile 26 and got emotional at that point - I was going to break 3:16:00! No freaking way! Zoomed through the finish and the other side was one of the greatest moments of my life. Not just because of a big PR and an almost guaranteed spot at Boston next year. I had locked in mentally, ran a smart race, and proven to myself I could do it. 

# Post-race

I was humbled and overwhelmed by how many friends had been tracking me and opened my phone to tons of celebratory messages. I rejoined my husband, enjoyed a couple of Michelob Ultras at the runfest, and had some of the best BBQ of my life for lunch (Truth BBQ is a must in Houston!). 

I rarely leave a race satisfied but Houston was pure magic for me. My big lesson was that I race well when its cold. I'm looking forward to a couple of shorter spring races in my hometown then who knows what's next for me until Boston (fingers crossed) next year!

There's this girl in his life (24F)—they were friends for 8 years, but then they started sleeping together for a couple of months right before him and I started dating.

At one point in our relationship, they decided to hang out (he told me they were going for coffee)—instead, they went for a walk and hung out in a park alone. I even had a friend message me to let me know she saw them sitting on a bench alone and she found it weird. I made it clear to him that it made me very uncomfortable, seeing that she was the last one he was sleeping with before him and I got together. He didn't see anything wrong with it and disregarded my feelings completely until his sisters told him that it was in fact weird and 'off'. He then decided to stop talking to her (not because he wanted to).

Recently they started talking again and she invited him to go for a walk again. He says that ""they were friends for 8 years before they hooked up"" and he ""misses the friendship."" I find it weird that they feel the need to hang out alone.

1i7a865,https://i.redd.it/o1ekpyjbjjee1.jpeg,Double digit update,"This is the best that I have felt off of caffeine. I quit for about a month and a half early last year and almost lost my job because I would fall asleep in my car on my break and that wasn’t a good look. This time around I don’t seem to need a nap every day and if I do it’s a short nap. 

I’ll start with the cons that I’m experiencing:
- sleep isn’t great. I fall asleep fine but I have been waking up at 6 or 7 every day and not tired enough to go back to sleep. I guess this isn’t inherently bad I just am used to sleeping until 10 with no issues so it’s an adjustment. I also haven’t been remembering my dreams this time around which is weird because in previous experiences I would have really vivid dreams that were enjoyable so I am hoping that comes back soon. 

- depression. I am not super depressed, I’ve been more depressed in the past but I have this lull about me that is a little annoying. I don’t have a ton of joy at the moment but I know in time it will return to me. 

- desire. The biggest con is just a desire to have a hit of dopamine from caffeine when I wake up. I don’t feel bad at all when I wake up but the old habit is there fighting to be satisfied that I would make myself high with caffeine in the morning. 

Pros:
- way more calm. I was getting anxiety attacks on caffeine. Something would trigger me and my hr and bp would skyrocket and make me feel liked the world was ending and crumbling around me. This would be very in opportune because it would happen at work or in the car or places where it was hard to have an anxiety attack. That is gone now. If something triggers me it’s mild and I’m able to cope much better and move on much quicker. 

- energy in the morning. When I first started decaf I would wake up feeling groggy and foggy and it would take me a few hours before I felt awake. Now I feel pretty good as soon as I wake up I’m just not used to waking up earlier yet. 

- Energy throughout the day. I don’t have that afternoon crash anymore and if I do it’s normally solved by a quick nap. My energy is consistent and doesn’t ebb and flow as much. My energy is higher which was unexpected for me this early in the game. 

- more present. I feel more present in my life. I’m not on a Ferris wheel of getting to the next thing. I don’t feel like I’m always being pulled out of whatever I’m doing to go onto the next thing. I’m able to just stop and be present and soak up the moment more. I can enjoy simple things again much more like listening to music, watching a show or just having a conversation with my wife. This is probably the best pro outside of reduced anxiety. I know this will only get better so I’m optimistic about that. 

Overall the pros outweigh the cons. I don’t want to be ruled by such an insidious drug which I felt like I was and based on the cons of quitting I still kind of do. This has been worth it and I know it’s an investment that will only pay more and more dividends over time. Best of luck to all of you and I will not drink caffeine with you today ",1,1737549692.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

No perfect solution found yet.

I’ve been on vyvanse 30mg about 2 and a half weeks and I’m still trying to crack the best routine. I am TERRIBLE with mornings and getting out of bed and am constantly running late however I go to circus school (extremely physical and mental which requires focus and lots of motivation) 9am-4pm, often am expected to stay back for an hour or two and so some self directed training - and then I also need motivation to maintain a healthy life when I get home (cooking, cleaning, showering etc). As an athlete I am making sure to eat regularly including protein. I used to drink coffee which helped me in the mornings but stopped when I started the medication as on the first day my heart felt like I was going to explode. I do wonder if introducing coffee back into my mornings could help me with that side of things… I am also on 20mg of citalopram if that’s relevant.

My findings so far:
Taking it an hour and half before needing to wake up is GREAT for motivation to get out of bed which I usually struggle with so much resulting in always being late. Kicks in faster due to empty stomach and also helps me manage to brush my teeth and have a proper breakfast and pack lunch etc. However it does result in an earlier crash before school ends and I never have motivation after school which is really important for me to keep on top of my life.

Taking an hour before school starts and after breakfast is nice for being awake and alert at the start of school but still leaves me with the struggle of getting out of bed and getting to school on time. I find the onset is a lot smoother and sometimes I don’t even notice the effect. Same problem of running out of motivation by the end of school though.

I’ve experimented with taking it later (10-11am) too. This makes for a hard morning: getting out of bed, being on time and also means in my first class I am tired and struggle with being attentive. Does mean I have the most motivation near the end of the school day which is nice because that’s usually the hardest part of the day - and I’m usually able to stay back for an hour or two and do some productive training. I STILL struggle with keeping up the motivation by the time I get home though and it’s been so difficult.

Edit: Changing the timing of my dose hasn’t appeared to affect my sleep. 

So my question for you is what routine have you put together that’s allowed you to get the most out of your medication as someone who works or study’s similar hours to me and able to keep up with life tasks when you get home?",1,1737549233.0,VyvanseADHD,11,1.0,False

Well suited to make every minute A dream of delight,

That the eggs by a chicken were laid.

And the salad that bears such an innocent look,   
And whispers of fields that are green,   
Is covered with germs, each armed with a hook,   
To grapple with liver and spleen.   
No matter how tired, and hungry, and dry,   
The banquet how fine, don't begin it

# Tarot

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Card-Based Powers, Art-Based Powers, Object-Based Powers, Sensory Powers, Temporal Powers, Psychic Powers

**Type**: Passive/Random

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

After preventing another group from trying to kidnap Aiura, and helping her in her work (for a large amount of coffee jelly), Saiki acquired the ability of **Tarot**.

**Tarot** is an ability that will create 3 cards in case the past, present, or future is in danger. The cards are usually in this order.

**1st card: Time.**

**2nd card: Disaster.**

**3rd card: Causer or place of the event.**

However, the cards are usually very ambiguous so Saiki must find out what causes it, who causes it, why it happens, before the world is destroyed.

\-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-\_-

# Trivia

* Occasionally, **Tarot** gives the best dates and locations for coffee jelly offers to Saiki.
* Theoretically, Aiura could possibly develop this ability.
* **Tarot** also protects Saiki from changes in the past.

The group is predominantly female, and I’ve only been attending for a few weeks since moving to town. Over time, I’ve developed a crush on someone in the group, and I think the feeling might be mutual. There are a few signs I’ve picked up on:

- She seems happy to see me, with big smiles and wide eyes.

- She gives me a hug when I arrive and even one when we leave.

- She’s not shy about putting her arm around my waist when we take group photos.

- She asks me how my week has been and seems genuinely interested in my life.

- Last week, I noticed she was wearing the same pair of boots that I always wear, which isn’t common here, and it stood out to me.

The tricky part is that she co-runs the group with her friend, so I’m not sure if she’s just being friendly or if she’s showing interest in me. I haven’t noticed her acting this way with anyone else, which makes me think it might be more than just friendliness, but then again sometimes I am the only male there so it’s hard to judge. 

Here’s where I’m torn: I don’t want to make things awkward or be seen as 'that guy' who’s only there for romantic reasons, especially since I joined the group primarily for the social aspect. At the same time, I don’t want to give the impression that I’m not interested if she is.
