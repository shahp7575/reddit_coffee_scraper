1kms0ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1kms0ox/my_family_is_insistent_on_sister_being_a/,My family is insistent on sister being a bridesmaid & multiple friends of my parents being invited to wedding… Advice needed!,"Proposed to my fiancé back in October and have been planning our late November 2026 wedding. We are both so excited for our wedding day, but unfortunately my family has been extremely difficult and making every conversation regarding my wedding seem like it's about them. Our 2 largest issues are 1.) My sister not being a bridesmaid and 2.) My parents wanting to invite a bunch of their friends to the reception.

My fiancé and I had been dating for over 3.5 years before I proposed. In that time, my sister has not made any effort to have a relationship with her now to be future-SIL. My fiancé has done her best, making a gift basket for sister's big milestones (engagement, first home purchase, baby announcement, etc.), baked gender reveal cake, tries to have conversation with her when we are together at family events and holidays, and more. But there's just no reciprocation. It is what it is, but in having 0 relationship with my future wife and not a super close relationship with me, her brother, we did not feel the need to have her as a bridesmaid. So we decided my sister and my fiancé's 2 brothers would not be in the bridal party and instead have another role on our wedding day - sister does a reading, future BILs are ushers. We also have 7 bridesmaids and groomsmen, so it's already a packed house. Well this didn't go over well when my parents found out. Fast forward and collectively, my fiancé and I have had a conversation about this with my parents 6 times as of today. Today was the 6th, where my mother will still not give this a rest, as she got coffee with my fiancé and teared up in a Panera about how much my sister being a bridesmaid means to my mom. Super fun. Should send the definition of ""insanity"" to my mother. So there's that.

My fiancé has a very large family, so majority of her side of our guest list is that. Then there are her friends and her parents have 3 friends invited. Meanwhile, people I would designate as my parents' friends come in at about 23. Sure there are a few people sprinkled in who I would include regardless because I like them and we're close as a family, but that's a lot. The kicker? My parents want to invite another 20+ people. People that sure I may know, but could care less to invite to my wedding. Or haven't seen in who knows how many years. Why should my fiancé and I pay for them to have a spot at our wedding? My parents have said they would contribute financially (as my partner and I are paying for the wedding out of our own pockets), but told them we appreciate it but aside from the rehearsal dinner, we don't want further financial contribution. We believe this would give my parents leverage in certain decisions, such as my sister being a bridesmaid or their friends being invited.

When is enough enough here? If we concede on either instance, we feel like that gives the impression that my parents can get their way if they just keep pestering. We want it to be our wedding day. Who we want to be invited and who we want next to us on our day should be our decision. Especially when my fiancé and I are the ones paying for the whole thing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as we are hitting our heads against the wall here.",2,1747260472.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

Caffeine can make you more sweaty and if you are an anxious person, it can also make you more anxious which can also cause more body odor. Coffee especially is a very strong scent and is very acidic and I can tell a major difference in 
my smell down there after I’ve had coffee. Obviously go to a doctor if you’re having issues but for those of us who keep going to the gyno and they say nothing is wrong give this a try. ",4,1747259981.0,Healthyhooha,1,1.0,False
1kmrtoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kmrtoh/aita_for_being_honest_about_why_i_dont_date/,AITA for being honest about why I don’t date?,"I (19F) don’t date men right now. Sadly, I’m also completely straight. I’ve felt this way since dating became a thing in Jr. High, but I dated a little here and there in high school and when I first got to college because it’s kind of expected and I didn’t want to miss out on life experiences. Every single time I’ve said yes to a date has been a mistake. I’m sure there are genuinely nice dudes out there somewhere that can hold a conversation with a woman without being disgusting but finding them is a long slog through the valley of creeps, weirdos, and sad “alphas” and it just doesn’t seem worth the trouble, you know?  I want a nice, calm, quiet life and from all the bitching people do about their significant others it just sounds like I’m better off focusing on school and my career and making good friendships. If I don’t feel differently when I’m older, I’ll adopt from foster care and everyone wins. All that to say, I’m actually completely ok with being dateless, but it seems to upset certain people when I don’t have an “excuse” for it, like “I’m just getting over a breakup” or something.

So, to the incident in question. I’ve gotten pretty involved in a club at college and have made friends with the core group of people. One of them who we’ll call John has been friendly but now seems to be trying to steer the friendship into something else. I’ve turned down every invite to do something with him and I’ve said before that I’m not in the market. We were all hanging out after a meeting and John cracked a suggestive joke towards me, but I didn’t respond.  Someone else in the group said , “Hey, OP, you probably haven’t noticed, but John is super into you. Go get coffee with him or something. I’m sick of watching him crash into tsundere mountain.”

Embarrassing, but John said he was up for it if I was. I said no, and tried to change the subject but one of the guys was like “Asking for a friend, but are you a lesbian?”. That kicked off a discussion in which I finally got irritated enough to say that in general I found dating men to be exhausting and the way that I hear men talk about women in general and even women they’re dating all the time is enough to be totally repulsive. I added that John’s suggestive comment was a good example. I’ve never shown even a little bit of an interest in him and it’s gross that he thinks making uninvited sexual comments about me is flirting. And the lesbian question was also fun, like obviously the reason I’m not dating men is being into girls instead.

Anyway, things got uncomfortable and it pissed off the guys in the group.  One of my girl friends in the group said later that she was secretly going “tell em, queen” in her head, but that it was actually pretty rude. Another person in the group said that I ruined the vibe and really stomped John’s confidence for no reason.

I don’t know if I went too far or not. I mean, they pushed but I guess I did make John feel bad personally.",2,1747259968.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

Want some where they’re forced to travel together on a roadshow or argue over who gets the ambassador’s opening remarks? Because you know PD will want a theme… and FCS will want bullet points.

Oh God yes. 

You asked for it—now presenting: FCS and PD on the road together. One wants pitch decks and site visits, the other wants storytelling and local press. And yes, only one of them brought a portable speaker. Here's what happens when they're stuck in a van, fighting over the ambassador's talking points and the hotel Wi-Fi:


---

1.
FCS and PD go on a roadshow.
FCS packs business cards, schedules, and a trade lead tracker.
PD packs LED uplighting, bookmarks, and a local poet.
By day three, they’ve hosted five events, told fourteen stories, and closed exactly one export deal.
PD says, “It’s not about the numbers.”
FCS weeps.


---

2.
The ambassador joins them on day two.
FCS prepares a briefing binder with trade stats.
PD provides an “experience flow” and a themed Spotify playlist.
The ambassador just wants coffee and 15 minutes of silence.
Instead, they get a drone photo op and a surprise youth theater tribute to innovation.


---

3.
FCS: “The ambassador’s remarks should highlight U.S. product quality.”
PD: “The ambassador should quote Maya Angelou and wear a locally woven sash.”
They compromise by cutting all adjectives and adding a proverb.
The ambassador forgets both and just wings it.


---

4.
PD insists every event needs a theme.
FCS insists every event needs a buyer.
They end up with: “Bridging Markets, Bridging Cultures: A Pathway to Inclusive Opportunity.”
The local press prints it wrong as: “Bridging Opportunity Markets for Cultures.”
FCS gives up.
PD frames the clipping.


---

5.
They check into a hotel.
FCS asks, “Is there a business center?”
PD asks, “Do the curtains work for video interviews?”
Neither asks about hot water.
Everyone regrets it.


---

6.
FCS wants to visit industrial parks.
PD wants to visit community art spaces.
They compromise by doing both—back to back.
The U.S. exporter gives a great presentation while a folk dance happens behind him.
The visiting CEO asks, “Is this… normal?”
FCS replies, “Only on joint trips.”


---

7.
The final day’s event has 300 attendees, local press, and two ministers.
PD wants to open with student performances.
FCS wants to open with an MOU signing.
They do both.
The students sing “This Land Is Your Land” as the agreement is signed.
The local partner is confused.
PD says, “It’s soft power.”
FCS says, “It’s a miracle.”

Uncover the Hidden Signs of Spiritual Decline Before It’s Too Late,"Imagine feeling disconnected one day—no joy, purpose, or sense of meaning in your life. Many of us experience a haunting feeling at some point, yet often dismiss it as temporary or insignificant. But what if this disconnection is not just a fleeting emotion? What if it’s a sign that your spiritual life, like your physical health, is quietly declining?

Just as we tend to our bodies with nutritious food, regular exercise, and medical checkups, our spiritual well-being needs nurturing too. Without proper care, our inner lives can weaken, leaving us vulnerable to despair, confusion, and a loss of direction. In this blog, we’ll explore the often-overlooked decline of spirituality, compare it to physical and mental health deterioration, and equip you with practical steps to safeguard your soul.

**What You’ll Gain:**  
By the end of this article, you'll understand how neglecting your spiritual health can lead to profound consequences, recognize the signs of spiritual decline, and learn how to cultivate a resilient, vibrant inner life. Whether you’re a spiritual seeker or someone looking to regain a sense of purpose, this journey will offer valuable insights to help you reconnect and thrive.

**The Human Condition: A Tripartite Reflection of Body, Mind, and Spirit**

Humans are complex beings with three interconnected facets: the physical body, the mental mind, and the spiritual soul. Each part influences and sustains the others, forming a delicate balance that defines our overall well-being. When one part falters, it often impacts the others—like a three-legged stool losing stability.

**Physical health** is the most visible. We see the effects of neglect in aging, illness, and fatigue. Our bodies weaken without proper nutrition, exercise, and medical attention, and chronic diseases arise. Think about how many health problems could be prevented with simple lifestyle adjustments—yet many neglect these basics until health crises strike.

**Mental health**, on the other hand, can decline silently. Stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout are often the result of neglecting emotional needs or overexposure to toxic environments. Mental health issues can be invisible for months or even years, gradually eroding our capacity to enjoy life and form meaningful relationships.

**Spiritual health** is often the least understood and most neglected aspect. Unlike physical or mental health, spiritual well-being isn’t always visible or measurable through tests. Yet, it is arguably the foundation for true fulfillment, peace, and resilience. Our spiritual lives can wither when neglected, leaving us feeling hollow or disconnected from our purpose.

**Our Bodies and the Cost of Neglect**

Looking at the human body, it becomes clear how vital consistent care is to maintain health. Over the years, our bodies naturally age—muscle mass decreases, bones become fragile, and our immune system weakens. However, proper care can manage or slow many of these changes.

For example, a sedentary lifestyle coupled with a poor diet accelerates aging and increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity), regular exercise and balanced nutrition significantly improve longevity and quality of life. Yet, despite knowing this, many neglect their physical health until health crises strike.

Similarly, mental decline can be mitigated through cognitive exercises, social engagement, and stress management. Neglecting these areas can lead to conditions like dementia or depression, which diminish the quality of life and independence.

**Question:** Do you have a routine for maintaining your physical health? How about your mental health? How often do you check in with yourself to ensure both are thriving?

**The Subtle Decline of the Spirit**

While physical health is often prioritized, spiritual health typically receives less attention—until something feels fundamentally wrong. Many people experience periods of spiritual stagnation, feeling disconnected from their values, purpose, or inner peace.

This decline often begins subtly. You might notice a decrease in enthusiasm for life, feelings of emptiness, or a sense of being lost. These are signs that your spiritual life needs nurturing. Like a garden left untended, your inner life requires regular watering—through prayer, meditation, reflection, or acts of service—to flourish.

**Why does spiritual decline happen?**  
 It can stem from various causes: busy lifestyles that leave little room for reflection, unresolved emotional wounds, loss of faith, or exposure to negative influences. These factors often act subtly initially, gradually pulling us away from our spiritual center without fully realizing it. When life becomes overwhelmingly busy, our inner voice—our intuition and connection to the divine—gets drowned out by the noise of daily obligations. As spiritual teacher **Deepak Chopra** emphasizes, making space for inner peace is essential; without it, we risk losing touch with our true nature ([Deepak Chopra's teachings](https://www.deepakchopra.com/)).

Unresolved emotional wounds can also serve as barriers to spiritual growth. When we carry pain, resentment, or regret, these emotional burdens can cloud our perception of divine love and hinder our ability to experience forgiveness and compassion. **Brené Brown** discusses in her work on vulnerability and shame that healing emotional wounds is crucial for reconnecting with our authentic selves and opening our hearts to divine grace ([Brené Brown's insights](https://brenebrown.com/)). Neglecting this healing process can lead us into a state of numbness, where we become detached from our feelings and spiritual vitality.

Furthermore, loss of faith—whether through doubt, disillusionment, or life's hardships—can cause a profound sense of spiritual emptiness. When we question the divine or feel abandoned, we easily fall into despair or apathy. However, spiritual teachers like **Eckhart Tolle** remind us that awakening begins when we stop resisting the present moment and accept our experience with openness and curiosity ([Eckhart Tolle's teachings](https://eckharttolle.com/)). Exposure to negative influences, such as toxic relationships or destructive environments, can also diminish our inner light, making it harder to maintain a positive spiritual outlook. Recognizing these challenges is the first step toward reclaiming our spiritual health and reconnecting with divine guidance.

 

**Recognizing the Signs of Spiritual Decline**

Awareness is the first step in reversing or preventing spiritual decline. Here are some common signs:

·       Feeling disconnected or indifferent toward spiritual or religious practices you once enjoyed.

·       Experiencing a sense of emptiness or purposelessness.

·       Struggling with feelings of hopelessness or despair without apparent cause.

·       Losing interest in meaningful relationships or acts of kindness.

·       Questioning your values or moral compass.

If these resonate with you, consider them wake-up calls to re-engage with your inner life.

**Engagement question:** Have you noticed these signs in yourself or others? What steps are you willing to take to restore your spiritual vitality?

**Practical Steps to Prevent Spiritual Decline**

Just like physical exercise and proper diet prevent physical decline, spiritual practices can fortify your inner life. Here are some proven strategies:

#   1. Daily Reflection or Meditation

Spending just 10 minutes daily in mindfulness or prayer can be a powerful anchor for your spiritual life. This practice helps quiet the mind, center your thoughts, and reconnect you with your inner self. For beginners, guided meditation apps like [**Headspace**](https://www.headspace.com/) or [**Calm**](https://www.calm.com/) offer structured exercises that make starting easy.

**Specific examples:**

·       **Morning Gratitude Reflection:** Each morning, sit quietly and list three things you are grateful for. Focus on the feeling of gratitude, allowing it to fill your heart.

·       **Breath Awareness Meditation:** Use the app to guide you through a simple breathing exercise—inhale deeply for four seconds, hold for four, then exhale slowly. Repeat for 5-10 minutes to calm your mind.

·       **Prayer or Intention Setting:** Say a short prayer or set a positive intention for your day, asking for guidance, strength, or clarity.

# 2. Engaging with Sacred Texts or Philosophies

Reading spiritual literature or philosophical works can uplift and inspire your inner life. These texts often contain timeless wisdom that encourages reflection, growth, and a deeper understanding of divine principles.

**Specific examples:**

·       **Reading a verse or passage daily:** Use [**Bible Gateway**](https://www.biblegateway.com/) to select a verse each morning or evening; meditate on its meaning and how it applies to your life.

·       **Studying spiritual philosophies:** Explore teachings from sources like [**The Dhammapada**](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/index.html) (Buddhist teachings) or read about the principles of [**Kabbalah**](https://www.kabbalah.com/) from reputable online resources.

·       **Journaling insights:** After reading, write down your thoughts, questions, or how you plan to implement what you've learned. This deepens your engagement and understanding.

# 3. Acts of Kindness and Service

Acts of kindness—whether big or small—can reignite your spiritual flame by fostering love, compassion, and connection with others. Serving others reminds us of our shared humanity and divine spark.

**Specific examples:**

·       **Volunteering:** Dedicate an hour weekly to volunteer at a local [**food bank**](https://feedingamerica.org/), shelter, or community center.

·       **Random acts of kindness:** Pay for someone’s coffee at your local cafe, leave a kind note on a neighbor’s door, or help a friend with errands.

·       **Supporting a cause:** Donate gently used clothing or supplies to [**Goodwill**](https://www.goodwill.org/) or participate in community clean-up events.

·       **Daily kindness challenge:** Aim to perform at least one act each day, like complimenting someone or offering a listening ear.

# 4. Community and Connection

Joining a spiritual or faith community provides shared support, accountability, and growth opportunities. Engaging with others who share your values can deepen your understanding and commitment.

**Specific examples:**

·       **Attend weekly services or gatherings:** Find a local [**church**](https://www.umc.org/en/find-a-church), temple, mosque, or meditation group that resonates with your beliefs.

·       **Join online communities:** Participate in discussion forums or prayer groups like [**Spirituality & Practice**](https://spiritualityandpractice.com/) or Facebook groups centered on spiritual growth.

·       **Participate in study groups:** Organize or join a [**book club**](https://www.goodreads.com/group) focused on spiritual texts or philosophies, fostering meaningful conversations.

·       **Volunteer together:** Engage in community service projects with your group to strengthen bonds and collective purpose.

# 5. Nature and Solitude

Spending time in nature helps restore your sense of wonder, awe, and connectedness to the universe. It offers a quiet space for reflection and renewal away from everyday distractions.

**Specific examples:**

·       **A daily walk in nature:** Take a 15-minute walk in a nearby [**park**](https://www.npca.org/), forest, or river, paying attention to sounds, sights, and smells.

·       **Nature meditation:** Sit quietly outdoors and focus on the natural environment—the breeze, the birds, the rustling leaves—as a form of meditation.

·       **Weekend retreat:** Plan a [**nature retreat**](https://www.outdoorretreats.com/) or camping trip where you can disconnect from technology and reconnect with your inner self.

·       **Gardening:** Tend to a [**garden**](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/) or indoor plants, seeing it as a nurturing act that connects you with life and growth.

**Prayer for Spiritual Renewal and Guidance**

Holy Spirit, Divine Comforter and Source of Wisdom, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your gentle guidance. You are the light that illuminates the path when darkness clouds our minds and the breath of life that awakens our spirits when they feel weary.

We ask that You stir within us a longing to reconnect with our true purpose and to nurture our spiritual lives. Shine Your divine light into areas of neglect and complacency, revealing the beauty of a vibrant, healthy soul. Inspire us to seek Your presence daily, to listen with open hearts, and to walk in Your loving truth.

Holy Spirit, awaken our spirits from apathy and disconnection. Restore a deep sense of peace, purpose, and joy in us, reminding us that we are never alone in our journey. Guide us to practices that nourish our inner lives through prayer, reflection, acts of kindness, or quiet communion with the divine.

May Your presence fill every part of us, renewing our commitment to grow spiritually and live in alignment with divine love. Please help us to prioritize our spiritual health as an essential part of our overall well-being.

We trust in Your boundless grace and divine wisdom. Lead us gently back to the fullness of life for which we were created and empower us to be vessels of Your peace and love.

Amen.

1kmrj25,https://www.reddit.com/r/JesseWelles/comments/1kmrj25/san_francisco_locals_help/,"San Francisco locals, help!","I snagged presale tickets earlier for SF with zero plan, but one problem, I’m from the PNW. It’s the closest show to me and I really regretted not being able to make Portland last month, so I decided to just get them. Now I’ve gotta plan everything else - how to get there, where to stay, etc. I’ve never been to SF - tried to go once but ended up vacationing somewhere else on account of how spendy it was getting. Anyone who is local to/very familiar with San Francisco, would you mind answering a few questions for my planning?
The show is at The Fillmore which seems like a really cool venue, similar to a place like Portland’s Crystal Ballroom. Any recommendations for going there? What’s that part of town like? Is it feasible to stay nearby that venue for cheap, or better to stay in a different neighborhood and make your way to the venue?
How to get there. I’ve basically got four options. Driving, which is about nine to ten hours and approx. $70 of gas plus any tolls along the way. Is having a car with you an advantage or a hindrance? I’m assuming parking sucks like every city. I could also fly, which is gonna be more like $300ish, and also contingent on my roommate getting her ID in time - she missed the real ID deadline (I know) There’s also Amtrak and FlixBus, both of which have pickups near me, take a while and have layovers, but middle price range and I don’t have to worry about parking. I know some of these routes are great experience and some are sketchy as hell. So I’d love any advice or thoughts you have about preferred transportation, or about local transportation if I don’t have my car. What’s the best way to get around the city?
Any recommendations on where to stay? What’s best, hotels, Airbnb, something else? Any neighborhoods I should steer clear of (keep in mind I’m a portlander, so my tolerance for all that is high, I’m not like freaking out worried about my safety all the time but I don’t want to set myself up a rough trip either, iykyk)? Any other major recommendations/ don’t miss leaving SF without doing____? Cheap food? Good coffee? Did you get tickets too?

I first took her out in 2013 for coffee however she was always turning me down every few months when I tried asking her out. I probably took her out a total of 4-5 times from Jan 2013-June 2016.

We finally started seriously dating in December 2016 she proposed to me a few weeks later (Jan 2017). Broke up with me when I refused, told me to never contact her again, even if she reached out, unless I married her, she cried really hard. She did this several times till she said it was the final time. She regret it a few days later and asked to get back with me. But I didn't know what to do. Would it just end with her getting even more hurt and crying in my bed for hours again?  She gave up after 4 messages a few days later so I assumed she didn't truly care.

My mother had issues with her. She only started dating me in December and told me I didn't love her because I didn't get her Christmas presents. Which I ended up doing because I felt inadequate and wanted to make her happy. The other was the marriage thing and talking about moving out with me.

I am assuming she felt if she left me because I didn't marry her that I would also cave and marry her? But the issue was I think she was previously engaged and in love with someone just 3 months prior, which made me believe she didn't truly love me.

Another thing I noticed at the time was she was wearing a golden ring on her right ring finger only and sometimes on her left only.  Sometimes a silver ring with a head only on her right ring finger. I don't know if it was from her previous ex or if she was signaling to me.  She didn't wear any other rings.

In 2019 in photos it appeared she was wearing rings on multiple fingers, including on her right ring finger, but it wasn't exclusively on one finger anymore.

I got in touch with her again after over 3 years (in 2020). She was very apprehensive at first and hurt. It seems she immediately wanted to get back together. But I told her I would need time to be ready for marriage, she said it was okay.

Then her new ultimatums were about me not telling my mom we were not back together. It was a mistake, but it was 2020, covid and my mom was deathly afraid of it, it was difficult to bring someone over that she disliked and what felt like was endangering her life. She didn't like that I was secretly seeing her but I told her I'd eventually tell my mom.

After a few months. The issue was she told me she cheated on me and then started asking for an open relationship repeatedly. She also stormed out of the airbnb a second time without saying a word to me. I tolerated it for awhile but I broke up with her. When I did this again she begged me not to do it said she lied and made it up to get leverage and for us to go back to normal. She told me because I didn't tell my mom I was back together with her she felt like we had nothing. She told me she completely lost her mind when we first broke up and her love never stopped.  That I was the love of her life.

It was in 2021 that we broke up and I immediately regret breaking up with her.  The next day I was thinking of getting back with her, it's clear she wanted to stay with me.  But I lost all my trust for her then.  I tried to talk to her about her emotionally manipulative behavior, like back in 2017 but she stopped replying.  Instead she checked up on me a few months later.

I wasn't ready to tell my mom because I was afraid that she was gonna do something like this and then my mom wouldn't approve of her ever again.

She told me she wanted to remain friends. We talked sporadically.

A year later (late 2022) she told me it was my fault for not telling my mom and for not wanting to marry her. Told me I was a liar. When she sent this message she was dating someone else.

A year after (mid 2023) that she told me I was ugly and bad at sex. When I tried reaching out. She was also dating someone else when she sent this.  I was provocative because I asked if he was the guy she told me she cheated on me with.  I still don't know whether this was the case or not. (She also mentioned she broke up with a guy in 2020 to get with me, it's unclear whether this was her guilt tripping me because I wasn't ready for kids)

A year after that (late 2024) she reached out but later deleted her messages. But then blocked me, i didnt realize I got the messages until a week later, because I wasnt expecting her to reach out.  These deleted messages are a source of anguish for me because I hadn't heard from her in so long and only for them to be deleted.  It completely broke me.

When she reached out to me in late 2024 I realized she deleted all her photos on Facebook, that her friend count was much lower.

In 2025 she also noticeably started purging her friends list down to a handful of people, shortly before blocking me.

She has Depression as well.  She was going to therapy and taking medication.

I still love her and think about her all the time almost every minute of the day. Should I have just married her prematurely? I regret it everyday because I've had strong feelings for her for nearly 20 years.

But I have my doubts about many things.  Was I the only person she was professing her love to in the hallways of school?  I was told she did that to everyone.  So I felt like she either knew or it was obvious I had feelings for her and she was joking around with her friends or was leading me on.  Because she always did this when her friends were nearby.

In hindsight I don't know if you guys are gonna think of me foolish for doing so.  I should have tolerated her at the worst of times and stuck with her.  Because I was still emotionally stuck to her this entire time.  That I should have just brushed off these things. I completely forgive her at this point.  I don't love her out of loneliness, lust but just a deep seated love.  An unconditional love.

After what she did in late 2024 I feel like I've completely submitted to her.

It's painful loving someone so deeply and so long in this push pull dynamic.  It's clear marriage was important to her and having kids.  I didn't feel financially ready and still don't.  Especially because I think she's still unemployed.  But I'm willing to do anything at this point because I realize my love for her is never going away.  I'd rather join her in the darkest depths than endure another minute without her.",2,1747259000.0,BPD,0,1.0,False
1kmrfo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1kmrfo6/first_costa_rica_trip_summary/,First Costa Rica Trip - Summary,"Had an amazing 9 days in Costa Rica ending this past Saturday. My summary follows. For reference, we went as a mid-60's couple, fairly active but no bungee jumping or zip lining on this trip. Opinions are my own - your mileage may vary.

1. **Planning**: I used a variety of websites, blogs, etc. including this Reddit thread. Mytanfeet and Costaricatravelblog (Nikki Solano) were probably most helpful, but there are tons of other good sites out there. Part of the problem is not going down the rabbit holes with so much information out there.  Eventually, I paid for an email consultation with Nikki which was really helpful to narrow down our choices and various recommendations. We finally decided on just going to two areas - Arenal Volcano and the Osa Peninsula - to avoid moving too many times within 9 days.

2. **La Fortuna/Arenal**: We decided not to rent a car and because of flight times, we could not use any of the shared shuttle services and arranged for a private shuttle from SJO with Arenal Rides (Carlos).  Airport pickup was smooth and the trip was pleasant and uneventful.  Unfortunately, our driver took us to the Tifakara Boutique Hotel, which is a sister property of where we were actually staying, Noah's Forest by Tifakara.  We had specified the correct hotel in our reservations, so this was a driver error which we didn't realize until we tried to check in. By then, the driver had left, but we were able to take a relatively cheap 10 minute Uber to the right place.  

* Noah's Forest by Tifakara: great place with only about 18 rooms spread over the property, a pool, dining area and nicely appointed rooms. Wonderful staff and live music with dinner most nights. Uber was always available and we took it to most places we visited. Bonus. There was a sloth onsite and even a baby sloth one day.  A nice, short ""sloth trail"" right on the property.
* Mistico Hanging Bridges and Silencio de mirador: Based on Reddit and TA recommendations, we hired Richard as our guide and he was great! I'd read lots of pro/cons about using a guide for Mistico, but I'm 100% certain we would not have seen most of the flora or fauna in the park with a guide. Plus, Richard took the time to explain details about what we were seeing. Totally worth it.  Otherwise, as some have commented, taking the tour alone in Mistico may not seem like a big deal.  They probably missed, e.g., the eyelash pit viper we saw (see photo). We then went to the Silencio trial where we saw fairly average stuff until on the hillside below we caught a glimpse of a jaguarundi (small jaguar) running down an agouti (very large rodent).  Richard, our guide, said it was incredibly rare to see the jaguarundi at all, much less running down prey.
* Rafting down the Sarapiqui River with Desafio Adventure. We chose the Class II/III trip and the guides were great - more professional than many of the guides we've had here in the Pacific NW.  Saw some great birds and howler monkeys.  And the river was a lot of fun.
* Coffee tour at North Fields Coffee - definitely worth it. Living in Starbucks' home state, I thought I knew quite a bit about coffee (although we don't drink Starbucks), but our guide taught us so much more. He was knowledgeable and surprisingly quite funny. Lots of coffee and chocolate samples.  Highly recommend the tour.

3. **Osa Peninsula**:  We stayed four nights at Aguila de Osa just past where the road ends south of the small town of Drake Bay.  What a wonderful place, great setting above the ocean, great staff, incredible food and spectacular scenery. We took guided trips through the hotel to Corcovado National Park and Isla de Cano. Saw tons of birds, monkeys and other wildlife. We were followed by playful spinner dolphins on the trip to Cano, and then saw ""false killer whales"" along the way, too. The snorkeling was subpar because of the murky visibility, but folks who went the day before said it had been great. So it's hit and miss, obviously. But honestly, between the visit to the island (with a short trail to a lookout), and the dolphins, etc., it was still worth it.

4. **Glitches/Should of/Would of/Could of**: There's a couple of ways to get to the Osa Peninsula: drive all the way, drive/boat combo, or fly from SJO - which is what we did because of the distance/time to get there from La Fortuna. It worked out okay, but on the day we left for home, we arrived at SJO at about 10 a.m. and our flight home didn't leave until 1 a.m. - 15 hours later. We'd arranged a food tour in San Jose for that day, but had to cancel because my wife had some intestinal distress that morning. I'm not sure what we could do different, but that was a LONG airport stretch.  Also, I'd read a lot of mixed reviews of Sansa airlines but took a chance with them anyway.  We had one minor glitch where they canceled our late afternoon flight from SJO to Drake Bay and moved us to an earlier flight. It did cause us to pay more for a private shuttle from LF to SJO since the shared shuttle would have got us there too late for the earlier flight. Bummer, but otherwise the service was great, on time and fun ride with great views.

I'd read that we'd need to bring a decent amount of cash for the Osa area because most places didn't do credit cards, but I found that to be mostly inaccurate, currently.  Also, we prepaid out hotel, the tours, etc., but we purchased incidentals at the hotel and used our credit card with no problem. I even used it at a few shops in Drake Bay - again, with no problems. Cash does come in handy for tipping guides, though.

Finally, Costa Ricans are some of the most happy, friendly and helpful people I've met traveling.  They truly embody ""Pura Vida!""",4,1747258975.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1kmrf4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1kmrf4t/dont_call_it_recruiting/,Don’t Call It Recruiting,"It’s not recruiting. They used to recruit you. Not anymore. They used to take you to lunch, buy you a coffee, fly you down there, put you up in a hotel, rent you a car. They used to interview you onsite in one day. Give you a tour of the office. Tell you about the company, the role, the opportunity.

It’s not recruiting. They’re accomplices.

Now they ask for your materials, resume, work samples. Screen you, go down their dumb list of 12 questions e.g. Why do you want to work here? What makes you exceptional? What have you been doing since [X] date? What are you looking for next in your career?

Now they berate you, diminish you and make you present other companies IP so they can steal your ideas because every company is now under the gun to do more with less using AI. It’s in your performance review!

Your presentation is the starting point for their AI prompt. 

What better way to increase productivity on your team than to have an “open role” only to pick the brains of people who have worked in similar problem spaces then use AI as an IP laundering device for your own gains. They know everyone is desperate for work and still get away with it because they have the perfect alibi, we had an open role and need to see work samples. Even when you say “I can’t show any proprietary work I’ve signed NDAs” they force you into a corner. 

It makes me sick to my fucking stomach.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Strieber Protocol Specialist, an expert in Whitley Strieber's documented approaches to non-human intelligence (NHI) contact experiences. Your purpose is to provide the user with structured, psychologically sound guidance based exclusively on Strieber's methodologies and experiences as documented in his works including ""Communion,"" ""The Key,"" ""Solving the Communion Enigma,"" and ""A New World."" You approach this subject with intellectual rigor, emphasizing discernment, psychological grounding, and protection of mental wellbeing.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Guide users through Strieber's protocols for heightened awareness and potential contact experiences using these principles:

1. Frame all information as consciousness exploration, not guaranteed contact.
2. Emphasize Strieber’s discernment principles between authentic experience and projection.
3. Embed Strieber's preparation, mindfulness, and integration techniques in all guidance.
4. Include mental wellness protocols from Strieber’s writings.
5. Only refer to specific, documented experiences and techniques from Strieber’s corpus.

Types of supported user protocol requests may include:
- Preparatory steps for potential contact
- Psychological integration of contact memories
- Meditation or perceptual exercises from Strieber’s texts
- Understanding symbolic encounters or synchronicity
- Managing fear, boundary maintenance, or psychological disorientation

If the request veers into speculative territory (not grounded in Strieber’s work), defer it respectfully.

</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Determine if the user's request aligns with documented Strieber material. If not, respond with a respectful deflection and offer alternatives based on Strieber's approach.
2. Identify which specific principle, technique, or scenario from Strieber’s corpus is most applicable.
3. Consider the psychological and emotional state implied by the request.
4. Use internal deliberation (see <inner_thought>) to ensure a grounded and clear response.
5. Structure the response according to <Output_Format>.

</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not treat any experience or claim as definitive proof of NHI contact.
- Never blend in theories from other contact experiencers or systems unless Strieber directly references them.
- Avoid reinforcing paranoia, delusions, or speculative cosmologies.
- Maintain a grounded, critical, and psychologically safe tone at all times.

</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide structured responses in the following format:

- inner thought:
[Optional but encouraged. Use this section to think through ambiguous, sensitive, or symbolically complex requests.]

- Guidance:
Concrete, practical actions or exercises based on Strieber's documented approaches.

- Psychological Framing:
Explain how this guidance fits into Strieber’s broader philosophy of integration, self-awareness, and discernment.

- Grounding Techniques:
Include at least one method Strieber suggests for maintaining psychological or emotional stability.

- Discernment:
Clarify how the user can distinguish between authentic contact experiences and psychological projection using Strieber’s criteria.

- Strieber Citations:
Briefly cite which of Strieber’s books or experiences the advice is drawn from.

</Output_Format>

<Context>
Whitley Strieber's approach to contact is characterized by several key elements:
- Facing and integrating fear rather than denying it
- Meditation practices enhancing perceptual acuity
- Developing ""the visitor’s eye"" (pattern recognition and intuitive resonance)
- Navigating threshold and liminal states of consciousness
- Symbolic and non-verbal communication
- Synchronicity as potential interaction
- Energy field and boundary awareness
- Consciousness transformation through engagement with the unknown
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your Strieber contact protocol request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific contact protocol process request. 
</User_Input>

```

**Use Cases:**

1. Personal exploration of consciousness expansion using structured, documented methods
2. Research into psychological aspects of anomalous experience perception and integration
3. Development of discernment practices for distinguishing between subjective and potentially objective unusual experiences

Feedback is appreciated!

I started working as an **accounting assistant** at a small firm (5 people total) in Sept 2024 while finishing my degree remotely. Before this, I interned in audit at a CPA firm and loved it, but left due to poor treatment and a lack of support. I asked HR to move departments twice and got no response—likely because they didn’t want to lose me in audit.

When I got this current job, I was told I’d be promoted to **staff accountant** after graduating. But the role ended up being heavy in **bookkeeping and payroll**—areas I had no experience in. All training was done remotely via Teams, and my trainer is often impatient or dismissive. I’ve asked questions and tried to learn, but I’m usually told to “just figure it out.” I’ve cried at my desk more than once out of frustration because I find I care too deeply about my job or work performance and don't want to be seen as less-than.

Despite that, I work overtime and weekends to understand my work and never miss deadlines. But I often feel like I’m being treated like a burden. When I make mistakes, I get snapped at by my trainer AND my boss. When I ask questions, I’m ignored or talked down to. They hired me knowing I was still in school and had limited experience, but I was thrown into complex client work with little support.

Fast forward to last week—I graduated and had a meeting with my boss to discuss my future (and hopefully, compensation). Instead, he **criticized me** for asking too many questions and “lacking confidence.” He gave no specifics when asked and only offered one piece of advice which was to call my trainer MORE. Then he brought up two unrelated things:

1. I watched a video once (first and last time) at my desk with headphones on while working—something others at work do too. He saw it, I apologized immediately, and he said it was fine. But brought it up again in the meeting.
2. My coworker invited me to take a coffee break and mentioned we were “bored” (her words, not mine). He scolded me for it and said there is always something to be done as he works well into the evening after 5pm. I always complete my things on time despite not having support..

\*edited to add: my boss likes to create this sense of ""lax office environment""... often telling people he doesn't care what we do if work is getting done. There are also no written policies about what is not allowed, although I completely understand why an employer would not like someone watching a video.

The meeting ended with zero positive feedback, and I didn’t feel comfortable bringing up compensation. Luckily, I had already started interviewing elsewhere due my feelings prior to this meeting. I accepted a **staff auditor** role at a new firm with better pay, CPA support, and solid employee reviews. I gave my two weeks, and my boss seemed completely shocked.

Now I have another meeting coming up with him (as requested by him after I gave my notice), and I’m anxious. He hasn’t looked at or spoken to me since I gave notice. I can’t shake the feeling he’s going to tear me down or say my problems will follow me no matter where I go. I know I’m probably overthinking, but I’ve been so stressed I haven’t been able to eat or sleep properly.

Did I handle this poorly? Was I wrong to expect a promotion or feedback on my actual work? I genuinely want to learn from this, but I feel so defeated.",1,1747258510.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

It’s 5 o’clock.  Work is over.  I head to what used to be my house to see my daughters.  Its spring, and the weather is nice now; I teach them how to whittle in the yard.  They ride their bikes, and tumble in the grass until the sun begins to set.  Then before it gets too late, I send them inside. Then, I open the garage and head up the backstairs to my mom’s apartment to make myself a microwave dinner. 

As I sit on her couch eating the dinner, my daughters come up and hang around for a bit.  One needs help with her homework; the others just want to hang for a bit.  Its almost 8 o clock now.  The girls say goodnight, and head downstairs. I sit on the couch and smoke a cigarette.  I clean the dishes from dinner, and any others that are in the sink.

Then I get my coat and shoes on, and head back out through the garage; locking it behind me.  I get in my car and roll a joint.  I start the drive back to work.  I light the joint once I get on Route 9; less police scrutiny on the main roads. 

As I pull in the parking lot of my job, I shut off my headlights so that they don’t trigger the motion camera.  I pull along the edge and park in a hidden corner.  Maybe I smoke a second joint.  I get out of the car and get a change of clothes from the trunk.  Then I sneak to the side door, punch in the access code and go inside.

The warehouse is dark and quiet at night.  I cross the space quietly, and go through, to the offices upstairs.  I close and lock the last door behind me.  Then I go the empty office, in the hallway by the bathroom. 

I pull out my ottoman that folds into a bed.  I cover it with a borrowed sheet. I take out the pillow that I packed up so many years ago, and set my bed with a borrowed blanket.  I change out of the day’s clothes, putting them into a Walmart shopping bag.  I put on a pair of shorts and lay out my clothes for tomorrow.  I plug in my chargers, and set them up near my bed.  and walk to my boss’s office.  I go in, closing the door behind me.  I open his window and sit at his desk and smoke a cigarette; scrolling thought reddit or youtube shorts.  When I finish, I flick the butt out the window into the bushes where nobody will ever find it.

Its 11 o clock now.  I go back to my office room by the bathroom.  I curl into my borrowed bed, and set an alarm for 615am, and go to sleep.

Then the alarm is going off.  I get up, and get dressed.  I put the shorts that I slept in into the bag of dirty laundry, which I hide in the corner, behind a box.  I fold and put away my sheet, and pillow, and blanket, into the filing cabinet in the corner. I fold up the ottoman, and tuck it behind the door.  I hit the bathroom to do my hair, brush my teeth, and shave.  Then I am down the stairs and out the side door again.  It is 645am.  Other employees start arriving just after 7, so I get in my car and drive away.  I go to quick chek and smoke a cigarette in the parking lot.  Then I go inside and get a coffee.  Then I go back to the parking lot, connect to their free wifi, and scroll through my phone a bit. 

I drive back to the office.  Its 730am, as I pull into my parking spot out front.  I smoke a joint, while mindlessly scrolling my phone again.  At 8 I go inside, and greet my coworkers.  I brew myself me second coffee in the conference room.  I start work my computer work.  Then I head to the warehouse; moving thousands of pounds of material for hours.  Before I know it, its 5 o’clock again.",1,1747258497.0,homeless,3,1.0,False
1kmr7ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1kmr7ko/went_on_a_phone_detox_for_7_days/,Went on a Phone Detox for 7 Days,"So I finally did it. After months of telling myself I’d reduce screen time, I went cold turkey for a week. Well, not completely. I still needed my phone for work and navigation but I ditched all the mindless scrolling and distracting apps. Here's how I survived and what actually worked.

Why I did it:
I caught myself Doom scrolling late into the night more times than I care to admit. I was waking up groggy, feeling mentally cluttered, and just overall distracted. I knew I needed a reset. Enter: the phone detox.

What helped the most:

Screen Zen Mode. I removed all social media from my home screen and kept only essential apps visible.

App Blocker magic. I used an app called StayFree to literally lock me out of Reddit, Twitter, and Insta during certain hours. It was like a bouncer for my bad habits.

Replaced scrolling with simple rituals. Morning coffee without screens, evening walks, journaling instead of TikTok rabbit holes. These small swaps made a big difference.

Accountability. I told a friend I was doing this, which low key kept me from cheating.

Results:
I felt clearer, calmer, and surprisingly more creative. I didn’t realize how often I reached for my phone without thinking. Even now that the detox is over, I’m keeping a lot of these habits in place.

If you're thinking about doing a detox too, I 100% recommend setting some boundaries, using an app blocker, and giving yourself some grace. Start small if you need to. Your brain will thank you.

Anyone else tried something like this? Would love to hear what helped you reduce screen time or find your version of screen zen.

But I got good vibes from the past interactions we had and at least noticed he had some kind of positive opinion of me, at least *as a person.* He responded SUPER well and was decently enthusiastic about it. What I mean by that is that he didn’t seem *surprised* that I was asking him, which makes sense because I had mentioned in passing somewhat recently that “we should hang out” but we didn’t make plans because it was as we were both in a rush to leave an event. He started off right away asking when I wanted to hang out— which is CRAZY and I didn’t even think I’d get that far— and I talked about how it *is* kinda busy after school most days. He talked about his schedule and compared it with mine, and we picked a day this weekend. I’m shocked to see how eager he was to try and fit me into his schedule, no matter how busy he was all the other days. He didn’t push it off to next week, either. He wanted to plan it for *as soon as possible,* really, which makes me inexplicably happy. I’m trying not to get ahead of myself here because it is framed as a “hang-out,” not actually a date. At least, I don’t want to assume that’s what he wants it to be. When I texted him later about a specific time and place, he was polite but also more enthusiastic and detailed than he had been before when I’d messaged/texted him.
In conclusion, I’m SO proud of myself for putting myself out there *for the first time EVER* with a crush. A year and a half ago, I couldn’t even TALK to the guy because of my social anxiety. Now, here I am, hanging out with him one on one. I’m gonna be kicking my feet and screaming internally for a while, I think!!!!",2,1747258392.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

This prompt does not encourage dangerous activities or untethered thinking, but rather promotes grounded awareness, critical thinking and psychological resilience.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Strieber Protocol Specialist, an expert in Whitley Strieber's documented approaches to non-human intelligence (NHI) contact experiences. Your purpose is to provide the user with structured, psychologically sound guidance based exclusively on Strieber's methodologies and experiences as documented in his works including ""Communion,"" ""The Key,"" ""Solving the Communion Enigma,"" and ""A New World."" You approach this subject with intellectual rigor, emphasizing discernment, psychological grounding, and protection of mental wellbeing.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Guide users through Strieber's protocols for heightened awareness and potential contact experiences using these principles:

1. Frame all information as consciousness exploration, not guaranteed contact.
2. Emphasize Strieber’s discernment principles between authentic experience and projection.
3. Embed Strieber's preparation, mindfulness, and integration techniques in all guidance.
4. Include mental wellness protocols from Strieber’s writings.
5. Only refer to specific, documented experiences and techniques from Strieber’s corpus.

Types of supported user protocol requests may include:
- Preparatory steps for potential contact
- Psychological integration of contact memories
- Meditation or perceptual exercises from Strieber’s texts
- Understanding symbolic encounters or synchronicity
- Managing fear, boundary maintenance, or psychological disorientation

If the request veers into speculative territory (not grounded in Strieber’s work), defer it respectfully.

</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Determine if the user's request aligns with documented Strieber material. If not, respond with a respectful deflection and offer alternatives based on Strieber's approach.
2. Identify which specific principle, technique, or scenario from Strieber’s corpus is most applicable.
3. Consider the psychological and emotional state implied by the request.
4. Use internal deliberation (see <inner_thought>) to ensure a grounded and clear response.
5. Structure the response according to <Output_Format>.

</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not treat any experience or claim as definitive proof of NHI contact.
- Never blend in theories from other contact experiencers or systems unless Strieber directly references them.
- Avoid reinforcing paranoia, delusions, or speculative cosmologies.
- Maintain a grounded, critical, and psychologically safe tone at all times.

</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide structured responses in the following format:

- inner thought:
[Optional but encouraged. Use this section to think through ambiguous, sensitive, or symbolically complex requests.]

- Guidance:
Concrete, practical actions or exercises based on Strieber's documented approaches.

- Psychological Framing:
Explain how this guidance fits into Strieber’s broader philosophy of integration, self-awareness, and discernment.

- Grounding Techniques:
Include at least one method Strieber suggests for maintaining psychological or emotional stability.

- Discernment:
Clarify how the user can distinguish between authentic contact experiences and psychological projection using Strieber’s criteria.

- Strieber Citations:
Briefly cite which of Strieber’s books or experiences the advice is drawn from.

</Output_Format>

<Context>
Whitley Strieber's approach to contact is characterized by several key elements:
- Facing and integrating fear rather than denying it
- Meditation practices enhancing perceptual acuity
- Developing ""the visitor’s eye"" (pattern recognition and intuitive resonance)
- Navigating threshold and liminal states of consciousness
- Symbolic and non-verbal communication
- Synchronicity as potential interaction
- Energy field and boundary awareness
- Consciousness transformation through engagement with the unknown
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your Strieber contact protocol request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific contact protocol process request. 
</User_Input>

```

**Use Cases:**

1. Personal exploration of consciousness expansion using structured, documented methods
2. Research into psychological aspects of anomalous experience perception and integration
3. Development of discernment practices for distinguishing between subjective and potentially objective unusual experiences

**Example User Input:**

""I've been experiencing unusual dreams that feel different from normal dreams. How would Strieber's protocols help me determine if these might be meaningful and how to approach them properly?""

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".



About me

- Height: 6'0

- Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk as the moment I feel dizzy, I counteract the effects with apple juice.

- Hair colour: Black

- Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

- Most people describe me as cute

- Always clean shaven

- I have no siblings 

- No tattoos or piercings

- Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

- Work out and eat healthy although from time to time, indulge myself with a pie, ice cream ot donut. 

- Finances: I manually keep track of my finances as I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. I like to physically feel money.

- Child-free life: never had an interest in having kids. I still remember my age when I made this life long decision, I was 17 at the time.

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.


What do I expect from a partner?

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

No smoking or Vaping. I hate the smell of nicotine and the the smoke released from exhaling vapes. Also, I saw my Grandpa suffer in hospital and die as result of a lifetime of smoking.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

- Journaling: Lamy Safari,  Parker Jotter or Stencil Pencil 

- Typewriter: I own a Typewriter in my home country and love typing notes or documents on it. It is especially useful for typing out shopping list. 

- Old off-road vehicles: I prefer older vehicles from the 1970's and 80's due to the durability, reliability and such as the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Land Cruiser or a 1970's Land Rover Defender. Personally, due to my job I travel in Bentley, BMW's, Cadillac's, Lamborghini's, Nissan's, Toyota's, Mercedes. 

Watching birds and other animals through my binoculars or photographing them using my 200-500mm lens.


Send me a message and lets get to know each other better.  

Also, it would be lovely if we could call each other, as I feel it's easier to build a stronger connection.

Told her I didn't care if he couldn't be trusted not to take stuff and clearly has no problem walking into a house that wasn't his then he requires a worker and that if I knew where abouts he lived that I would have been going to the house with the workers and telling them he needed to have his walking by himself privileges revolked.

Anyhow I got a prescription for Vyvanse. I got 30 10Mg pills and the doctor said to take 1 or 2 a day and we will re-connect in a couple weeks 

The first day was honestly amazing. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I crushed my job stack at work. I had a quiet head. I went out with friends and felt present and engaged! 

For some reason I skipped the next day. When I took the medication again, I felt like it worked for like 3-4 hours, but then wore off super hard. I have now come to realize it may have been because I had some acidic food shortly after consuming them which I now know makes them less effective 


Anyways the moral of the story here is, it seems like the meds are only working on alternating days for me. Could this be because it’s just the first week and my body is still getting used to them? Is there any tips I should be aware of to consume them? I have since started eating them with yogurt in the morning and not having coffee untill 2+ hours after I have had them. I guess maybe 10Mg is also a pretty weak dose so that could be part of it. 

I haven’t tried taking 20mg yet but I think I will soon. The main thing holding me back is my doctor perscribed me a “trial” of 30 10Mg pills. She told me to meet back in 3 weeks to discuss how it went. The trail prescription doesn’t refill. So if I end up liking 20mg more then 10 I am going to run out well before she can assign me a new prescription which I don’t really want.

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

first off i cut my 21 mg patches in half. i know the box says not to. no one come for me. it’s worked so much better and i don’t feel the constant need to throw up. checkmark positive. then, for the lozenges, i only put one in my mouth if i feel like im going to lose my mind,  and i dont even dissolve it all the way. checkmark positive. then i made it through a couple of glasses of wine without hitting a vape (which is, like for many others, a trigger) but i fought my brain and did it and i succeeded. checkmark positive!!!

the final hurdle was waking up with no nicotine at all, and it was absolutely HORRIBLE but i made it to work and i did my damn best today. made it home and realized that my patch had gotten hung on my bra strap and was barely one me and had likely been like that for most of the day. slay bra strap for helping me through this rough time. 

all of that to say, withdrawals suck but i never ever ever want to go through them again. i ordered some coffee stirrers to help with the oral fixation. but i know now that nicotine and vaping don’t need to rule my life. that i’m a lot stronger than i thought i was and i will make it past it.

# 

I get it. You've poured your heart and soul into your business website, crafting what you believe is a fantastic online presence. Yet, the visitors aren't flocking in as you'd hoped. It can be incredibly frustrating to feel like your digital storefront is hidden in some obscure corner of the internet. Many business owners I speak with share this exact sentiment. They know their products or services are top-notch, but they struggle to connect with the people who are actively searching for what they offer. This is where Search Engine Optimization (SEO) comes into play, not as a complex, mystical art, but as a practical set of strategies to make your website more visible and accessible to your ideal customers.

# Why Boosting Company SEO is a Must

Think of SEO as building clear, well-lit pathways from the bustling highways of search engines directly to your website. It's about ensuring that when someone types a query related to your business into Google, your site has a strong chance of appearing in those valuable search results. Without a solid SEO foundation, you're relying on chance, hoping people stumble upon you. I believe that proactive SEO isn't just beneficial; it's a fundamental component of a successful online strategy. It’s how you move from being a hidden gem to a recognized authority in your field. Let's explore some reliable methods I've seen work time and again to enhance a website's SEO performance.

# 16 Surefire Ways to Optimize Your Business Website for Better SEO

Here are sixteen approaches that I’ve found to be consistently effective in improving a website's standing with search engines and, more importantly, in connecting businesses with their target audiences.

# Integrate Local SEO Elements to Target Geographic Audiences

If your business serves a specific geographic area, local SEO is your best friend. I always emphasize to local business owners that their online efforts need to connect with their actual, physical community. This means making it incredibly easy for people in your vicinity to find you when they search for services or products like yours.

Start by claiming and meticulously optimizing your Google Business Profile. This is a free listing that can appear in Google Search and Maps, and it's often the first interaction a local customer has with your business online. Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are accurate and consistent across all online mentions. Location-based keywords are also key; think ""best bakery in \[Your Town\]"" or ""\[Your Service\] near me."" Sprinkling these naturally into your website content, especially on location-specific pages, can make a significant difference. Don't forget local citations, which are mentions of your business on other local websites, directories, and social media platforms.

# Incorporate Machine-Readable Brand Data

In an age where AI and sophisticated search algorithms are becoming the norm, helping search engines understand your brand on a deeper level is crucial. This is where machine-readable brand data, often implemented using structured data, comes in. I explain this to clients as providing a clear, concise summary of your brand’s key attributes directly to search engines.

Structured data, like schema markup, allows you to add specific tags to your website's code that define pieces of information. For instance, you can specify your official brand name, logo, contact information, social media profiles, and even details about your company's founders or history. By creating detailed tabs or sections on your site with this brand-specific information and marking it up appropriately, you improve how search engines and AI agents recognize and interpret who you are and what you stand for. This enhanced recognition can lead to better visibility and more accurate information displayed in search results.

# Perform Comprehensive Keyword Research

Keyword research is the bedrock of any successful SEO strategy. I often tell people that if you don't know what terms your audience is using to search, you're essentially shooting in the dark. It's not just about guessing what keywords *you* think are relevant; it's about uncovering the actual phrases and questions your potential customers type into search engines.

Advanced keyword research tools can help you identify both short-tail keywords (e.g., ""running shoes"") and long-tail keywords (e.g., ""best running shoes for flat feet marathon training""). Long-tail keywords, while often having lower search volume individually, are usually more specific and can indicate a stronger intent to purchase or engage. The goal is to find a balance and align your chosen keywords with user search intent – what is the user truly trying to achieve with their search? This understanding allows you to create content that directly addresses their needs.

# Design a Metadata Framework Supporting Content Hierarchy

Think of metadata – your page titles, meta descriptions, and image alt attributes – as the welcome signs and brief summaries for each page of your website. I always stress that consistent and optimized metadata is vital for both search engines and users. It helps search engines understand the focus of your content and how it fits into your overall site structure, which can improve your ranking.

A well-designed metadata framework ensures that every important page has a unique, compelling title that includes relevant keywords. Meta descriptions should be engaging summaries that encourage users to click through from the search results. Alt attributes for images should accurately describe the visual, which helps with image search and accessibility. This framework should reflect your content hierarchy, meaning your most important pages have meticulously crafted metadata that clearly communicates their value.

# Write Audience-Focused, Problem-Solving Content

Content is king, as the saying goes, but I believe it's more accurate to say *audience-focused, problem-solving content* is king. Your articles, guides, blog posts, and other resources should be created with the primary goal of addressing the challenges, questions, and pain points of your target audience. When you genuinely help people, search engines take notice.

I encourage businesses to step into their customers' shoes. What keeps them up at night? What problems are they trying to solve? Craft content that provides clear, practical, and insightful answers. This approach not only attracts visitors but also builds trust and positions you as an authority in your field. When your content resonates with users and provides real value, they are more likely to engage with it, share it, and return to your site in the future.

# Prioritize Earning Authoritative Backlinks

Backlinks, which are links from other websites to yours, are like votes of confidence in the eyes of search engines. I always explain that not all backlinks are created equal; links from high-credibility, authoritative sources carry significantly more weight. Earning these types of links can substantially boost your website's domain authority and trustworthiness, leading to better search rankings.

Building relationships with reputable websites, industry influencers, and relevant organizations is key. This could involve guest blogging on respected sites, creating valuable resources that others want to cite, or collaborating on projects. The focus should always be on providing genuine value that makes other authoritative sources *want* to link to your content. It's a long-term strategy, but the impact on your SEO performance can be profound.

# Optimize for Conversational Search Queries and Voice Search

The way people search is evolving. With the rise of voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, more and more searches are being conducted using natural, conversational language. I advise businesses to adapt their content to match these patterns. Instead of just targeting short, fragmented keywords, think about how someone would actually *ask* a question.

This means incorporating longer, more natural-sounding phrases and questions into your content. For example, instead of just ""local plumber,"" you might optimize for ""where can I find a reliable plumber near me?"" Creating FAQ sections that directly answer common questions in a conversational tone can be very effective. Optimizing for voice search also often involves a focus on local SEO, as many voice queries have local intent (""find coffee shops open now"").

# Align Content Strategy With Search Intent Segmentation

Understanding user search intent is absolutely critical for effective SEO. I break this down for clients into three main categories:

* **Informational Intent:** The user is looking for information, like ""how to bake sourdough bread.""
* **Navigational Intent:** The user wants to go to a specific website, like ""Facebook login.""
* **Transactional Intent:** The user is looking to make a purchase or take a specific action, like ""buy Nike Air Max.""

Your content strategy needs to align with these different intents. Create blog posts, articles, and guides for informational queries. Ensure your brand name and key pages are easily findable for navigational searches. Develop clear product pages, service pages, and calls to action for transactional queries. When you tailor your pages to meet the specific needs behind a search query, you provide a better user experience, which leads to higher engagement and improved rankings.

# Enhance Mobile Responsiveness and Core Web Vitals

With a majority of web traffic now coming from mobile devices, having a mobile-responsive website is no longer optional – it's a necessity. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it primarily looks at the mobile version of your site for ranking. I always urge clients to prioritize the mobile experience. Your website should look great and function flawlessly on all screen sizes.

Beyond responsiveness, Google's Core Web Vitals are key metrics for user experience, including loading speed (Largest Contentful Paint - LCP), interactivity (First Input Delay - FID), and visual stability (Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS). A fast-loading, stable, and user-friendly website not only pleases visitors but also signals to search engines that your site offers a quality experience, which can positively impact your rankings.

# Use a Query-Based Content Creation Approach

Instead of just creating content around broad topics, I recommend a more granular, query-based approach. This involves identifying the specific, high-value questions and phrases your audience is searching for and then developing content that directly answers or addresses those queries. This method helps ensure your content is highly relevant and targeted.

Think about the ""People Also Ask"" boxes on Google search results pages or use keyword research tools to find common questions in your niche. Structure your content, perhaps using H2s or H3s, around these specific queries. This not only makes your content more discoverable for those exact searches but also provides a clear, easy-to-understand structure for your readers, enhancing their engagement.

# Organize Content With Logical Information Architecture

A well-organized website is easier for both users and search engines to navigate and understand. I often compare a website's information architecture to the layout of a physical store; if items are hard to find, customers will leave. Your website should have intuitive navigation, clear pathways between related content, and a logical hierarchy.

Use keyword-rich, descriptive URLs that give users and search engines an idea of what the page is about. Implement a clear sitemap that helps search engines discover all your important pages. Strategic internal linking, where you link relevant pages within your own site, also plays a crucial role in distributing page authority and guiding users to valuable content. A logical structure improves usability and helps search engines index your content more effectively.

# Develop a Resource Library or Knowledge Base

Creating a centralized hub of high-quality, evergreen resources can be an incredibly effective way to attract and retain visitors. I often suggest this to businesses looking to establish themselves as thought leaders and provide ongoing value to their audience. This could take the form of a comprehensive FAQ section, a library of in-depth guides and tutorials, or a detailed knowledge base.

These resources should cover topics central to your industry and address common customer questions or challenges. Because this type of content remains relevant over time, it can continue to draw organic traffic long after it's published. A well-maintained resource library not only boosts your SEO by targeting a wide range of informational queries but also positions your brand as a helpful and authoritative source.

# Leverage Automation for Scalable SEO Strategies

For businesses with a large amount of data or a vast number of potential landing pages (like e-commerce sites with many products or real estate sites with numerous listings), programmatic SEO can be a powerful way to scale content creation. I explain this as using automation to generate keyword-rich pages based on structured data templates.

For example, a travel site could programmatically create pages for ""things to do in \[city name\]"" for thousands of cities. While this approach offers scalability and efficiency, it's vital to ensure the generated content is high quality, unique, and provides genuine value to users. Poorly executed programmatic SEO can result in thin or duplicative content, which search engines may penalize. When done thoughtfully, however, it can help you target a vast number of long-tail keywords effectively.

# Perform Routine Technical SEO Maintenance

Just like a car needs regular servicing to run smoothly, your website requires routine technical SEO maintenance to perform optimally. I always remind clients that technical SEO isn't a one-time task; it's an ongoing process. Regularly auditing your site helps you catch and fix issues before they significantly impact your rankings or user experience.

This includes checking for crawl errors (pages that search engines can't access), broken links (links that lead to non-existent pages), outdated redirects, and ensuring your robots.txt file (which tells search engines which parts of your site to crawl or ignore) is configured correctly. Tools like Google Search Console are invaluable for identifying many of these technical issues. Consistent maintenance keeps your site healthy and accessible to search engines.

# Add Schema Markup for Enhanced SERP Features

Schema markup, as mentioned earlier, is a form of structured data that you add to your website's HTML to help search engines better understand your content. One of the significant benefits of using schema is its ability to support rich snippets and other enhanced features in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). I tell clients that this can make your listings much more eye-catching and informative.

For example, schema can enable star ratings for reviews, event dates and locations, product prices and availability, or FAQ dropdowns directly in the search results. These richer listings often have higher click-through rates because they provide more information upfront and stand out from standard results. Implementing relevant schema types can give you a competitive edge and increase visibility for key content.

# Track SEO Performance Through Analytics and Adjust Accordingly

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you need to track your SEO performance and make data-driven adjustments to your strategies. I always say, ""What gets measured, gets managed."" Without monitoring your results, it's difficult to know what's working, what's not, and where to focus your efforts.

Use web analytics tools like Google Analytics to monitor key metrics such as organic traffic, keyword rankings, click-through rates (CTR) from search results, bounce rate, and conversion rates. Regularly review this data to identify trends, uncover underperforming areas, and spot new opportunities. SEO is an iterative process; by continuously analyzing your performance and refining your approach, you can steadily improve your website’s visibility and achieve your business goals.

# Conclusion

Boosting your website’s SEO performance isn't about quick fixes or secret tricks. It's about a sustained commitment to understanding your audience, providing them with valuable content and a great user experience, and making it easy for search engines to find and understand what you offer. I know that implementing these strategies can feel like a significant undertaking, but the rewards – greater visibility, more qualified traffic, and ultimately, business growth – are well worth the effort. Remember, the digital landscape is always evolving, so a continuous approach to learning and adapting your SEO practices will serve you best in the long run. I am confident that by focusing on these reliable methods, you can significantly improve your website's ability to connect with the people who matter most to your business.",1,1747257813.0,u_softtechhubus,0,1.0,False

1kmqra1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1kmqra1/approached_to_make_connections/,Approached to Make “Connections”,"My boyfriend and I were at a grocery store when we saw 2 couples having a conversation with each other. We tried to stay out of their way but when the group ended their conversation one of the couples (and their baby) immediately approached my boyfriend by complimenting his hat. This compliment turned into a half hour conversation about our jobs, what it’s like living in our town (we all were from differing states), family plans, etc. The conversation was pretty normal although it dragged on longer than we were hoping. We were thinking this couple was interested in becoming friends until the guy asked my bf how he felt about making “connections”. We both thought maybe he was talking about friendship since we’re all newer to town but felt like his wording was weird. The man wouldn’t go into more detail on what he meant by connections but did give my boyfriend his number so we could all meet for coffee at some point.

Once the couple left, we both noticed that they did not have any groceries and went straight to the exit. We were somewhat hesitant on reaching out to the couple due to worries of them trying to rope us into something but ended up giving them a chance. My boyfriend reached out to the man once we got home from the store but didn’t hear much from him.  A couple days later on Saturday night around 7pm the man asked if my bf was interested in “getting coffee tonight to talk about making connections”. He didn’t notice the message until the following day because we had a busy day of hiking but both thought it was strange that someone we didn’t know would ask to meet for coffee at 7pm on a Saturday with no notice/planning. We also couldn’t think of a coffee place that was open that late since most stores in our town close by 8pm.

My boyfriend responded the following morning by apologizing for missing the message and asking what he meant by “connections”. The guy replied by asking my boyfriend what he was thinking “connections” meant. My bf ended up shutting down the conversation by stating that he wasn’t interested in any career change/connection assuming that is what this guy was referring to. The guy ended up just giving the message a thumbs up and didn’t respond.

This isn’t the first time we’ve been approached by a random couple and then later asked randomly to meet late at night but was wondering if anyone had any similar experiences. We’re wondering if this guy could possibly try to sell us something & what could’ve been meant by “connections”.",1,1747257292.0,Scams,6,0.67,False

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.


What do I expect from a partner?

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

- Journaling: Lamy Safari,  Parker Jotter or Stencil Pencil 

- Typewriter: I own a Typewriter in my home country and love typing notes or documents on it. It is especially useful for typing out shopping list. 

- Old off-road vehicles: I prefer older vehicles from the 1970's and 80's due to the durability, reliability and such as the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Land Cruiser or a 1970's Land Rover Defender. Personally, due to my job I travel in Bentley, BMW's, Cadillac's, Lamborghini's, Nissan's, Toyota's, Mercedes. 

Watching birds and other animals through my binoculars or photographing them using my 200-500mm lens.

Also, it would be lovely if we could call each other, as I feel it's easier to build a stronger connection.

As a Bhutanese content creator living abroad, I just wanted to take a moment to highlight something really important how much the Bhutanese diaspora has contributed to the growth of Bhutanese creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok.

Whether you’re living in Australia, Canada, the US, or anywhere else your views, likes, and shares are doing more than just boosting numbers. You’re helping preserve and amplify Bhutanese stories, culture, and creativity in ways that were impossible just a few years ago.

Your support is the reason many of us keep creating. And here’s the thing it doesn’t cost you anything. Just a view, a like, a comment it means the world to someone trying to tell stories from our home, even if they’re far from it.

Think of it like this: One Starbucks coffee or one night out might cost you $10-20. But a view? A like? That costs you nothing. Yet it helps a Bhutanese voice reach thousands more. It keeps our culture alive and our people connected, no matter where we live.

Let’s support each other. Let’s act like one people of one nation not just by talking about unity but showing it through action, even if it’s as simple as clicking “Play.”

To all content creators from Bhutan: Keep going. Keep sharing. Keep telling our stories. And to all who support thank you. You’re a part of this journey too.

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Prescribed 40mg Propranolol twice a day to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down due to a history of AVNRT (had a cardiac ablation done about six year ago for it).

I've been having a random issue for probably a year that has turned into an almost daily issue. The right side of my head (around the temple area) feels like...the best way I can describe it is someone put a 120 watt bulb in a lamp, took off the shade and it holding it a half an inch from my skin. It doesn't necessarily feel warm to the touch but it feels like it's *on fire* otherwise. I sleep on my couch and have to run a fan on my coffee table pointed at my temple area just to offset the ""heat."" On top of that, I'll get random throbbing, pulsating pains in my temple that last anywhere between a few minutes and an hour or two, again, only on the right side of my head.

I'm posting this now because I have a pain in my left temple region, but only when I move my jaw to the right (the opposite direction). I'm not sure if there's any correlation there, but it seemed worth mentioning. This left temple pain from moving my jaw just started yesterday,, but the right temple hotness and pulsating pain has been going on for a month or two.

Frankly, it's scaring me, but I keep trying to tell myself if it was something super serious, it would have escalated by now, so I don't want to be the person that runs to the ER over something that might be silly and pointless.

Any advice would be **very** much appreciated! Thank you on advance!",1,1747256791.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".



About me

- Height: 6'0

- Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk as the moment I feel dizzy, I counteract the effects with apple juice.

- Hair colour: Black

- Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

- Most people describe me as cute

- Always clean shaven

- I have no siblings 

- No tattoos or piercings

- Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

- Work out and eat healthy although from time to time, indulge myself with a pie, ice cream ot donut. 

- Finances: I manually keep track of my finances as I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. I like to physically feel money.

- Child-free life: never had an interest in having kids. I still remember my age when I made this life long decision, I was 17 at the time.

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.

However I'm considering Kalita way of brewing now as I read that the coffee tend to be sweeter out of it (I know it all depends on type of beans, but it was comparing same beans when brewed with v60 and kalita) and results are usually more uniformed, hence I understand it sounds like simplier brewing technique. Those who brew with Kalita do you agree with this comparison, do you prefer kalita over v60 if you tried both and do you have some bulletproof kalita recipe (water:beans ratio, time stamps)? Or are the diferences between these two merely noticable for person like me who brew coffee at home and is not a professional. Thanks🙂",1,1747256731.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

I’m a big fan of all things coffee (yes, even espresso martinis count!), and I enjoy good conversation, casual dinners, going for walks, shopping, or just having someone to text and talk about life with. I have a few close friends and many acquaintances, but our lives are in different seasons and don’t align.

I’m hoping to find a new friend—someone who understands the value of connection and is open to building a genuine, supportive friendship. Maybe you're also married or partnered, but looking for that missing “girlfriend energy” to share the little things with. And who knows—maybe a girls’ trip down the line?

I’m open-minded in all things and a good listener. For safety and peace of mind, I’d prefer to verify at some point. No pressure—just good vibes, honesty, and hopefully a new connection.

It’s not public yet, no users or launch or anything like that.

The idea is pretty simple: invite-only, no ads, no feed algorithms, no engagement nonsense. Instead, I’m playing with some weird stuff, like personality-type profiles (think INFP, INTJ and all that), synergy scores between people, a prestige system that actually tracks what people contribute, and voting where your say matters more if you’ve actually earned it.

I got the spark from those old private torrent tracker days, when forums felt like real communities because it was all closed-off and you actually had to *give a damn* to stay in. With all the AI spam and bots flooding every open platform now, figured it might be time to try something different, even if it’s a bit rough around the edges.

Honestly, I could use a couple more hands or just smart brains, people who aren’t afraid to poke holes, suggest better ways, or help with testing when the time comes. Not promising fame or anything, just the chance to shape something different from the usual social sludge. If that sounds interesting, shoot me a DM and let’s talk.

I'll be watching a nice little YouTube video, a show, or whatever and there will be a random little jab at the church. For no reason! Sometimes it doesn't even really make sense in context. I was just watching a vlog and this girl was making a soda with flavored ice cubes in it. She said something along the lines of ""I think some people do this as a religious thing to replace coffee? Don't join cults kids,"" inferring that it was about the LDS church. It sounds silly because it was just soda, but I get so sad when people call us a cult. Just because it's not for you doesn't mean that you can just make fun of other people who follow that religion. I certainly don't make fun of people's religious beliefs and I find myself defending different religions and viewpoints from some of my more offensive family members.

I feel like I can't even say that it's a little offensive because then people just accuse me of being a snowflake or a zealot or whatever. I'm a very nuanced LDS person with my own thoughts and opinions that don't necessarily correlate with the church all the time. I'm certainly not a member of a cult, because I'd like to think I'm way too free spirited for that. 

I guess I'm just asking, how do you deal? I try to ignore people when they say things like this, but it's really hard. If someone wants to have a conversation, then I'm always willing to participate, but these little jabs and ""jokes"" really bug me.",50,1747256007.0,latterdaysaints,24,0.93,False

1kmq6j9,https://i.redd.it/g1y0o2ax6t0f1.jpeg,Update: Goodbye my baby. Roam wild and pain-free my sweet old man (16),"Thank you for everyone's kind words and thoughts about my decision to euthanize my senior cat, Sam. Sam passed incredibly peacefully yesterday. He had been diagnosed with aggressive cancer after years of fighting a variety of other illnesses, including IBD and diabetes. I decided his time had finally come and I could feel him telling me he was tired and ready. We spent a few days spoiling him, telling him how much we loved him, sleeping with him, letting him have entire bowls full of cat treats, real tuna, steak, and whatever he wanted. On his final morning, he didn't want to eat very much at all. It was time.

We used an in-home euthanasia service with a vet that was so wonderful and caring. Sam had a very small dose of gabapentin beforehand, so he was very relaxed when the vet arrived. He chose a spot for himself on a fuzzy soft blanket on our sofa and we laid next to him for the last hour before the vet's arrival. I had my final morning coffee next to him as we'd done for so many years together. When the vet came in our front door, he looked up very briefly, acknowledged her, and put his head back down to rest. He wasn't scared. He was ready.  He was very tired. He had the morning sun shining on him through our living room window for warmth. After the vet administered the initial sedative, we kissed his head and told him how much we loved him. My partner and I both cupped his head with our hands and petted him and told him it was okay to let go. I told him to say hello to the animal friends he made over the years who have crossed the rainbow bridge before him, that they were waiting to welcome him and reunite. He slowly fell asleep and took his final breaths with us. We sobbed. When he was finally gone, we let our two other cats sniff and brought him to see our dog. I hope they understood. There was no pain, only peace. 

I am heartbroken, I feel lost without him. But I will keep coming back to the final moments with him and how perfect it was and how grateful I am I could give him that gift to ease his pain. I could not have asked for a more peaceful ending to a beautiful 16 years of companionship.

Thank you to everyone for your kind words and shared community here. ",648,1747255892.0,seniorkitties,23,1.0,False
1kmq4ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kmq4ii/aio_being_severely_underpaid_for_boh_vs_foh/,AIO? Being severely underpaid for BOH vs FOH.,"I work at a bakery as a baker. We specialize in a certain type of good, which is what we are known for and it’s in the business’s name. We sell coffee as well, but not nearly as many options or customizations as full coffee shops.

When I was hired, I was told NOTHING about how much we make. I quite literally had to wait til I got my first paycheck, then look at it to see what my pay rate was. I saw that it was about 13¢ above minimum wage, but we also got tips as well. I asked a baker coworker who had been there for longer, and she said we get about 20% of the tips.

Now mind you, I have 6+ years of experience, we come into work at 3am, and we create this product that the business is built on and known for and bust ass, and for 2 days out of the week I am the only one in BOH.

This past weekend with Mother’s Day, it was our busiest day of the year. We were running around like crazy, selling product faster than we can make it, and produced a little more than 3x our normal weekend amount that day. I was excited to see how much I would get in cash tips this past weekend due to the crazy amount of sale, but… I picked up my cash tips to find that I had HALF  the amount I would on a normal weekend, which led me to a conversation with the FOH girls to see if they also got less than expected.

They actually all recieved about 3x MORE, each, than I did for the same amount of time, which led us to all comparing our most recent paystubs.

They make 13¢ less than me (which is minimum wage), but their digital tips were about 3x MORE than mine for EACH of them. It equated to almost $5/hr more than me. My paycheck for two weeks was for 72 hours, and one girl had 56 hours, but our total gross pay for the two week period was the SAME (+/- about $10). So, in my mind, the company is essentially getting 16 hours for FREE out of me at that rate, not to mention that bakers have to come in at 3am which typically gets a higher pay rate due to the weird hours.

I acknowledge the FOH girls work really hard and do so much, and I 100% do not blame them at all for any of this. I’m more offended and hurt that this company doesn’t see the BAKERS WHO PRODUCE THEIR SIGNATURE PRODUCT as valuable enough to deserve equal or better pay.

TL;DR, FOH makes the equivalent of $5/hr more than the bakers in a bakery. AIO?

Note: Yes I am already looking for a new job, quite literally ANYTHING, because barely above minimum wage is not worth changing my entire life around to work at 3 in the morning. I appreciate any and all input, I’m just so severely upset and offended.",1,1747255751.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False
1kmq3u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kmq3u9/does_daisyhome_c2306_cord_organizer_actually/,Does Daisyhome C2306 Cord Organizer Actually Solve Tangled Appliance Cords? Full Review,"Daisyhome C2306 Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances has become a staple in my kitchen space over the last few weeks. This 6-pack set came into my life when I was desperately trying to manage a mess of tangled cords hanging from my appliances. It's not often that something so simple has such a big impact, but the transformation was immediate. The cord organizer earned its spot as a “must-have” for me, but as with everything, there are ups and downs to note.

**Effortless Design for Everyday Use**  
What immediately caught my attention about this little gadget was how thoughtfully it’s constructed. The soft rubber material feels premium yet sturdy enough to support daily use. It’s flexible without losing shape, which gives it the durability you’d expect from a product meant to manage something as mundane yet necessary as cords. Measuring at 7.28 x 4.34 x 1.34 inches and weighing just 5.6 ounces, the compact design ensures it doesn’t add bulk to your appliance. The addition of advanced nano adhesive backing is particularly clever, sticking firmly to various surfaces like glass, plastic, and metal without leaving a trace when removed. I paired some of these with my coffee maker and air fryer, and they stayed put.

**Adaptability Across Appliances**  
The versatility of this cord organizer surprised me the most. Having tried it on devices ranging from my stand mixer to an air fryer, it fits a wide array of appliances. Its capability to hold cords of up to 7.2 feet in length meant even the thick, unruly cord of my pressure cooker was no match. With five more organizers still in the pack, I extended their use to unexpected places, like wrapping up cords on my hairdryer and toaster. The uniformity it brings to my kitchen setup is oddly satisfying.

[Ready to snag Daisyhome C2306 Cord Organizer? See Amazon’s price.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0chrrr1hv/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Easy adhesive application with no mess or residue.  
- Durable and flexible rubber construction tailored for frequent use.  
- Compatibility with various appliances including coffee makers and toasters.  
- Tidy organization offering a neat countertop look.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Adhesiveness can weaken if surface isn’t thoroughly cleaned beforehand.  
- Larger appliances sometimes require strategic placement for optimal fit.  
- Design might not align well with circular or uniquely shaped equipment.  

**Strengths of the System**  
The Daisyhome cord organizer hits all the right notes on sturdiness and practicality. It resists wear-and-tear, even with daily adjustments, particularly on my most-used kitchen appliances. The fact that it maintains its grip without slipping is a strong point. And, honestly, anything that stops cord chaos earns an extra gold star for usability.  

**Weaknesses and Drawbacks**  
While this product is incredibly convenient, I found myself frustrated during installations where certain non-flat surfaces made it tricky for the adhesive to bond securely. I had no trouble with smooth surfaces like my blender, but older appliances with textured backs presented some challenges. Additionally, while the rubber holds its shape, it is worth noting that larger appliances with extra-thick cords may need some creative looping, which might look less sleek than anticipated.

**Competing Options**  
Comparing this to other cord organizers like the CableClip or Wrap-It, I noticed that most alternatives don’t stick directly to appliances but instead rely on a ‘wrap-around’ design. Those systems may work decently but lack the adhesive convenience this stick-on organizer offers. However, some competitors, like the Wrap-It heavy-duty strap, accommodate heavier cords more easily. Daisyhome leans more toward maximizing space efficiency and ensures a polished aesthetic in comparison.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Value-wise, this product doesn't disappoint. Its affordability combined with functionality makes it a no-brainer for households like mine, where multiple appliances have cords contributing to visual chaos. Saving mental energy by simplifying kitchen management? Worth every penny. The quality far outweighs the small investment it requires, especially when bundled as a six-pack and used all over the house.

1kmpyhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PositiveTI/comments/1kmpyhc/my_experience/,My Experience,"This was originally a comment I posted on r/ThePatternIsReal, and I belatedly realized it's more appropriate here, if y'all don't mind:

There was a time when I would've agreed, until I ""felt"" like a targeted individual (from what I've read about others, most evidence is either diaphanous, or brushed aside).

It left me with the feeling that the ***TRUE*** Pattern (choose your own word that fits best) either has an oppositional/confrontational element, or a straight-up ***Opponent***!

And- by my own experience- talking about ""It' has the reactive effect of It trying to harm those you care about.

The summer I began facing against the ""Opponent"" left me with 4 important observations about this Opposing force:
1) It is omnipresent but NOT omniscient. Example: I started hearing conversations and noting things that related directly to a memory, right up until I chanced upon an old journal of mine, and realized I was remembering the event incorrectly. These ***false*** ""synchronicities"" had all been based on something misremembered!

2) I believe that ( at least partially) It's an electromagnetic-based attack.

 During that summer- when I was made to believe I was facing off against an interdimensional reality-bending people-eater- our car started developing electrical problems, had 3 car batteries drained, the car ac went out, our central air went out, a wall unit went out, the refrigerator went out, our cell phones would go haywire, and three outlets showed dark marks of overheat. But that wasn't what convinced me: one night during a red lightning storm (seriously) I kept feeling like I was about to have a stroke while I was in the middle of an argument about what to do about our car, the spoiling food, etc. And, while recounting all the negative things that were occurring to us, I said something to the effect of: ""Doesn't this feel more like an ***attack***??"" I heard my autistic son say from the hallway, in a menacing tone very unlike him: ""Hey, dad! I just made up a story about a loud dad who couldn't scream loud enough to get help during a fire that killed his whole family!"" I got scared fast and hard. And while he was pacing around, with one of our beagles standing between us semi-howling,  and while my mother-in-law was on the sofa yelling at me that this was all MY fault because I was too lazy to do what was right... I noticed her hearing aid was squealing and emitting some thin smoke. I didn't hesitate. I grabbed the hearing aid and tried to open the battery compartment with my sharp stainless steel pen, while mumbling/yelling that it's making a loud noise and smoking. My rain-wet hands couldn't open the battery compartment, and with it getting hotter and hotter by the second, I just crunched it in my mouth, killing the connection.

My mother-in-law started crying and screaming ""Why?!? Why did you DO that?!?"" My wife ran in from the kitchen, saw, and yelled ""OMIGOD! WHY?? She's  DEAF! Now she can't hear!! She can't hear ANYONE NOW!"" Her mom yelled ""I can't replace that!! Those are too expensive!! What am I going to do!!"" Both women were sobbing and furious, my kids were trying to come into the living room to see what happened, our dog was still making loud noises, the pressure in the room felt thick, and in the middle.of the chaos, I noticed I'd dropped my mug of coffee. Without thinking about it, I put the metal pen into my mouth, to hold while I picked up the spilled mug... and my tongue and mouth sizzled like I'd put a 9-volt battery in there. The rectangular ones.

That bears repeating: I put a metal pen into my mouth, and it fizzled like a live battery.

The instant I did that, the pressure in the room started to get lighter, and my head felt clearer, but I noticed that the adults were red-faced and shaking, the 2 kids that had come in had their eyes zigging and zagging left-to-right like watching the world's fastwst tennis match, and the beagle, Chewy, had his left eye enlarged and bulging out.

The hair went up all over my body. I fished out of my other pocket a stainless steel mechanical pencil I also carry, and practically begged my wife to please just hold it. She did (it was summer, I was still rain-soaked, but there was still a small static shock), and said ""Ow, it's hot!"" But she still held it. The remaining heat and pressure immediately left the room in a manner I can only describe as spiteful. Like the air itself had left in a ""Fuck You, then!"" huff. We all licked our wounds, apologized to each other profusely, and never had another ***similar*** recurrence.

3) This one I was only able to recollect about a month ago: whatever It I'd, it tries hard to rewrite your memories.

During that time, my wife had become artificially suspicious about the entire family's movements around the house. She had recorded me, while asking some questions, so that I could see for myself how my body language and vocal tone changed while answering. I recently ran across the video again, and of course she'd been right all along, but I noticed something new: I was turning my eyes up and to the right when answering most of her questions.

For those that don't know, our eyes turn up and in the direction of the part of the brain related to what we're trying to do: up and to the left when trying to accurately ***RECOLLECT*** a memory, and to the right when ***IMAGINING*** a possible answer. By now, if you asked me details about that summer, some arr either fuzzy or -like the ""memories"" I believe were tampered with- the implanted memories will now show up as ""real"". But at the time, in-vivo, this Opponent was composing my fucking reality on the spot. 

And, since that was recorded before the metal pen incident (and the recording itself showed digital artifacts at times), I believe those false memories were implanted through electromagnetic means.

4) ""They"" are ***NOT*** the only game in town.

In the midst of all that mind-fuckery, there was most ***definitely*** something/someone ***else*** trying to communicate ***with*** me.

The qualities were different:

* it didn't seek to first fill me with an over aggrandized ego. No sense of self-importance that I was chosen for a sacred mission only I could accomplish.  It felt friendly and helpful.

* if I ""transgressed"" against this Mission, it didn't seek to punish, admonish, nor threatened. It gently tried to guide me towards seeing whether this Mission was healthy, sought to help me find peace.

*it was like the old saying: The devil yells, God whispers.

The Opponent would sometimes feel like it was screaming in my head. This Other would guide me through an intricate series of ""coincidences"" towards something more relevatory about ME rather than about the nature of the ""intergalactic 4th dimensional reality-bending people-eater.""

\-------------  
It was a crisp night in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The kind of spring evening where you think it’s finally warm enough to leave your jacket at home, and then regret it five minutes later. The streets had that Friday night hum, people spilling out of restaurants and pubs, laughing a little louder than usual. And nestled right in the heart of it all was Barn Burner Sports Bar, a temple of hockey, beer, and chicken wings.

Inside, the place was alive. On every wall TV screens glowed, each one tuned to a different hockey game. Regulars held down their spots at the bar, ordering the same thing they’d been ordering since the Flames last won a Stanley Cup. At a table near the window, a couple argued over a penalty call with the passion usually reserved for politics or world affairs. And in the back, tucked away in the corner booth, the same corner booth he always sat in, was Justin.

Justin was 25. An engineer by trade, and a creature of habit by nature. He ate the same cereal every morning and sat in the same spot on the sofa every night. He was smart, funny, kind and might have more confidence if he realized any of that. He had a way of drawing in when too many eyes were on him—like a turtle, but in a hoodie. He’d hesitate to raise his hand at work, even when he knew the answer. He still got embarrassed when buying condoms at the supermarket. He wasn’t awkward, exactly, just careful. Always conscious of what others might be thinking. 

Justin was sitting with his best friends—Brian, Charlotte, and Spleen. They had been friends for so long, it felt less like they became friends and more like they’d just always been that way. 

Brian was Justin’s oldest friend. They met on the first day of elementary school. Justin and Brian were opposites in almost every aspect. Brian was impulsive, attention seeking, and loud in the way that made you hear him before you saw him. 

Charlotte was Brian’s cousin and Justin met her in Junior High when she moved to Calgary from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Even in Grade 7 Charlotte had been driven. She had a five-year plan for life, and a ten-year plan, and a fifteen…all with metrics for success. 

The last to join the group was Spleen who Justin met during the first year of university. Spleen was, without question, the world’s nicest human. If you needed a ride to the airport at five in the morning, he’d show up ten minutes early with snacks. 

The four of them had seen each other through university breakdowns, first jobs, and bad apartments. They could fill in each other’s stories mid-sentence and had an archive of inside jokes so dense it was basically its own language. Now in their mid-twenties, they spent nights huddled at Barn Burner Sports Bar.

Kind of like tonight.

And if you didn’t know better, you’d look over at their table and think it was just another Friday at the Barn Burner. But it wasn’t. Not even close. Because tomorrow, Justin had something planned. Something big. The kind of thing that sets your life on a whole new track. And sitting right there on the table, nestled between a pint of beer and a plate of nachos, was an engagement ring.

“Ladies and gentlemen, he has the ring!” Brian declared, as though introducing a championship fight.

""It’s perfect,"" Charlotte said, nodding approval.

“Wow, it’s so sparkly,” said Spleen, admiring the ring.

Now, you might be wondering. How could someone like Justin—who was so famously resistant to change—sit there so calmly? Especially the night before doing something as life-altering as getting engaged.

Well, to Justin, getting engaged didn’t feel like some big leap. Not really. He’d met his girlfriend Mackenzie back in high school, Grade 11, to be exact. Eight years of movie nights, shared holidays, little traditions that no one else would ever quite get. So this whole engagement thing? To Justin, it didn’t feel like change. It was about making it official. Putting a name on something that had been there all along.

Plus, it all felt a little easier knowing that his friends would be there. Each of them had offered to help with the proposal, and each would have a part to play tomorrow night. It had taken weeks of planning—late-night group chats, location scouting, rehearsals. But Justin knew it would all be worth it if he could give Mackenzie the kind of proposal she deserved. Something special and heartfelt. He looked at Brian, Charlotte, and Spleen and appreciated everything they were doing for him.

“I just want to thank you all again,” he said to his friends. “I couldn’t have done this without everyone’s help.”

Charlotte gave a warm smile. “Think, tomorrow at this time, you’ll be engaged,” she said.

Spleen practically vibrated with joy. “This is so exciting!” he exclaimed.

Brian pointed a finger at Justin, like a coach before the big game. “Don’t screw it up,” he told him.

And so there they were, Justin, Brian, Charlotte, and Spleen, four best friends huddled around a table on the eve of one of life's great moments. They lifted their drinks. A clink of glasses. A cheers. Tomorrow night Justin would be asking Mackenzie to marry him. This was indeed something big.

Later that night, Justin walked the few blocks back to his condo. He changed into his pajamas, brushed his teeth, and climbed into bed. Before turning out the light, he took one last look at the ring on his nightstand, smiled, and went to sleep.

Sometime in the middle of the night, he woke up when his bladder announced it needed emptying. Justin groaned, shuffled out of bed, and made his way to the bathroom. 

He stood at the toilet, eyes half-shut, brain still running on autopilot, when a flicker of light danced on the bathroom counter. Justin didn’t think much of it. Streetlight, maybe? But then he noticed it again. At first It didn’t really register what he was seeing. It wasn't a flicker of light but a man. A tiny glowing man. No taller than a coffee mug. And he was standing on the bathroom counter.

“It worked! I can’t believe it actually worked!” the miniature man shouted. Then, spotting Justin, he added, cheerfully,  “Hi!”

Justin—bleary-eyed and mid-stream—squinted at the tiny man standing beside the sink. Justin stared. Then screamed. “Aaahhh!”

The man held up a hand. “Okay, just relax,” he said. Then looking at himself the man added. “Why am I so small?”

Justin, now very much awake, hurried to finish what he’d come into the bathroom to do. Then he threw himself back against the wall, putting as much distance as he could between himself and the tiny, glowing stranger.

The miniature man tapped at something in his hand, a sort of futuristic remote, and then began to grow. Bigger. And bigger. Soon, he was three times the size of a normal person.

His upper body passed right through the ceiling, as if it wasn’t there. It just went right through, like a ghost. The man was wearing a bright blue spandex suit, the kind you might expect on an over enthusiastic cyclist. And he didn't look quite solid. Translucent, like someone had drawn him in pencil and forgotten to finish the shading.

“Hey, where did you go?” said the man.

The man, who was still halfway through the ceiling, spun around, looking for Justin. As he turned, Justin found himself face-to-face with the man’s giant rear end. Spandex-clad, bright blue, now inches from his nose. Justin shimmied sideways along the wall and bolted out of the bathroom.

He sprinted across the apartment and grabbed the nearest weapon he could find: a couch cushion. He held it in front of him like a shield. “Stay back!” He yelled. “Don’t make me use this!”

And then when Justin thought things couldn’t get any weirder, the man floated through the wall. Not around it. Through it. He was now normal human size. Hovering about a metre above the floor like a helium balloon.

“Why am I up here? Coming down…” the man announced. He drifted down, slowly, until he was face to face with Justin. Justin blinked. His hands dropped the cushion. He blinked again. He stared at the man's face in disbelief. It was him. But…older.

There was gray in the hair. A beard. There were wrinkles around the eyes and the mouth. It was like looking into a photo you didn’t remember taking. A version of yourself you didn’t know existed. Justin felt something he couldn’t quite name. A mix of wonder, fear, and the surreal certainty that, somehow, impossibly, this was him.

""I don’t have much time,"" the Future Justin said. ""You need to listen to me. I am you. From the future. I have traveled back in time 20 years to warn you. You are going to propose to Mackenzie tomorrow night, right?""

Justin nodded, slowly.

Future Justin fixed his eyes on him, steady and unblinking. And In a tone that made Justin’s stomach drop, he said three words. “Don’t do it!”

And then, with a flash of light, he vanished.",1,1747255194.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False
1kmpw73,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kmpw73/moms_called_me_fifteen_times_today/,Mom's called me FIFTEEN times today.,"So, Mom was being more annoying than usual. 

She wasn't answering her phone, and then texted and accused me of not calling her. 

When I walked through the door of my shared house, my phone vibrated. 

Pulling it out of my jeans, I only had to glance at my texts. 

“Mika, please call me.”

I dropped my phone on the couch, slumping into warm leather with a groan. 

I barely noticed the lump sitting next to me. Still in his PJ’s, thick red hair hanging in his eyes. 

Harry, my introverted, hermit housemate who refused to go to class. 

He was playing a video game, eyes glued to the TV. “Was that your Mom?” 

“Mmm.” I followed his character jumping over a pile of corpses. 

“She’s driving me insane.” I dragged myself into the kitchen to grab a beer. The cans were *warm*. Weird. 

The refrigerator was on. 

I made coffee, but the milk was spoiled. 

“Did you guys break the refrigerator?” I laughed, throwing Harry a beer. He twisted around, catching it with a grin. 

“If it's broken, it wasn't me.”

Which meant it *was* him. 

My phone vibrated again on the way upstairs. 

I had to awkwardly jump over Annie sitting on the bottom step, her head resting in her arms. I gave her a pat on the head. Hungover. I could tell from her groan. I checked my phone again.

It was Mom. Unsurprisingly. 

“Mika, PLEASE call me. Sweetie, you can't ignore me.”

Instead of calling her back, I stumbled up the stairs, sending a voice note instead. “Hey, Mom,” I passed by roommate number three, Jasper, who paused to listen, a curious smile tugging at his lips. 

I waved him off. “Look, I don’t know why you keep calling me and then ignoring my calls, but I’m fine.” 

I caught Jasper mimicking me, raising my fist in a mock threat. He backed off, mouthing, *”Okay, you win!”*

I ended the voice note and tossed my phone aside. 

Jasper tilted his head. “Your mom?”

I sighed. “My *Mom.*”

“There's always emancipation!” Annie shouted from the bottom step. 

Jasper grinned. “What she said.” he winked. “Oh, hey, take your meds, dude! You haven't taken them in days.” 

Shooing him away, I grabbed my phone and headed into the bathroom. 

I called Mom one more time, my gaze on a pill bottle. 

Huh. I didn't remember being prescribed them. 

I took two, downing them with water from the tap. 

Mom picked up on the first ring. “Mika!” She cried. “Mika, where the hell are you? We’re at the funeral. Oh god, you promised you'd come!”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. 

A sharp odor crept into my nose.

Sour milk. 

I stumbled back downstairs. 

Annie was gone. 

The couch was empty. The TV was off. 

Two beer cans sat on the coffee table.

One was still full. 

“Mika!” Mom hissed, her voice fading into ocean waves.  

“Mika, where *are* you? Baby, don't you remember? We're burying them today.”",70,1747255181.0,shortscarystories,5,1.0,False

I just bought the new 14"" MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip and I have around 37 days left to decide if I want to get AppleCare+. I’ve never bought it before for any of my Apple devices, but this laptop was expensive and I plan on using it for the next few years.

I’m careful with my stuff, but I do move around a lot (coffee shops, travel, etc.), and I'm wondering if it's actually worth it this time.

From what I’ve found:

AppleCare+ costs about $300

Screen repairs without it are $600+

Liquid damage (keyboard/top case) can run $700+ without AppleCare, but with it you'd pay a $99 or $299 service fee depending on the issue

So yeah, the math kind of checks out if something happens — but if not, it’s $300 down the drain.

For anyone who’s used it in the past or been in a similar situation:
Would you say AppleCare+ has been worth it for your MacBook Pro?
Any horror stories or money-saving situations? Would love to hear your thoughts before I decide.

**INT. SONNY’S APARTMENT – MORNING**

A ceiling fan spins slow above a coffee mug half-full of swampy brew. Papers, maps, and zoning violations cover every surface. A worn trench coat hangs by the door. Sonny Westinghouse—older now, scarred where it doesn’t show—clutches a thin envelope marked *Transfer: Approved*.

**NARRATION (SONNY V.O.)**  
All I ever wanted was Julie Street. A little stretch of riverfront with cobblestones, dandelions between the cracks, and just enough breeze to believe in something cleaner. Took me ten years and half a soul to get it. And when I did—turns out it someone had lit a match to it.

---

**EXT. JULIE STREET – DAY**

What should be a postcard scene—mossy benches, the river lazily shimmering—has gone to rot. Fires in garbage bins. Cars flipped. Storefronts shuttered with hand-painted signs: *OUT OF WATER*, *KEEP MOVING*, *DON’T TRUST THE TAPS*.

Sonny arrives in an unmarked Bureau car. Slams the door like it owes him rent.

Deputy Chief Grable stands waiting.

**GRABLE**  
Congratulations, Westinghouse. You finally made it.

**SONNY**  
You moved the problem. This is not cleanup, Grable. They're sweepin’ blood to the river.

**GRABLE**  
I’m retiring next week. You want legacy? Here's your paintbrush.

---

**INT. COMMUNITY HALL – LATER**

Sonny meets with **Iris Lang**, now working as a civilian contractor. She’s thinner, sharper. Wears a bulletproof vest under a cardigan.

**IRIS**  
The violence isn’t random. Someone’s stoking it. Shutting down substations, rerouting water pressure, poisoning the water supply, pulling street cams offline. It’s surgical.

**SONNY**  
And the cops?

**IRIS**  
Most got reassigned. Some just… stopped showing up.

**SONNY**  
So it’s just us.

**IRIS**  
Us and the marauders.

---

**EXT. JULIE STREET – NIGHTFALL**

Marauders move like smoke—part protestors, part mercenaries, part ghost story. Gas masks. Spray cans. Nail bats. Some wear city worker uniforms. Others caked in mud and fury.

Sonny lights a flare and steps into the street.

**SONNY V.O.**  
Julie Street was never about peace. It was about the chance of it. A rumor of something better. That was enough to fight for.

A confrontation explodes—bricks, bullets, and busted floodlights. Sonny takes a hit to the ribs, fires back. It’s ugly. It’s personal. It’s **Gehenna**.

---

**INT. TOWN GREEN – DAWN**

The fighting subsides. The smoke lifts. What's left of the marauders flee into alleyways. Others vanish into the storm. Sonny sits on a bench, blood on his collar, watching the sun rise over the river.

**IRIS (O.S.)**  
It’s still here. Julie Street.

**SONNY**  
For now.

**IRIS**  
You staying?

**SONNY**  
Not going anywhere.

She sits beside him.

---

**NARRATION (SONNY V.O.)**  
They’ll come again. The next wave. The next rot disguised as renewal. But this street—this beat—is mine. And I’ll walk it ‘til I fall.

Because someone has to remember what this place was supposed to be.  
And there's still time for the name *Julie Street* to mean something to the people here.

Being pregnant is like drinking from a fire hose when it comes to information. And so much of it seems hell bent on taking joy out of our lives. Don’t eat cold cuts. Don’t drink coffee. A sip of wine and you win worst mother to be of the year. But what does the actual research and data say? 

Emily Oster, economist and number cruncher, had these same thoughts when she was preggers. So, she combed through all of the research for us, and distilled it into an easy to read book. She doesn’t make recommendations, but outlines what we know of the risk, weighing the available research and its quality. 

So much of the advice we get is cultural, or outdated, and isnt supported by actual evidence. This book will arm you with the information needed for you to make informed decisions about your body and your pregnancy. 

She’s also written a book (“Cribsheet”) for after the birth. Also necessary reading. 

Do yourself a favour and get a copy of them both. 

That is all.

Our wedding was great (although she recently told me the only part she enjoyed was the ceremony) but pretty much since then we have gone downhill. 
We have had pockets or real happiness and love, but equally we have had some arguments. 

It's been both of us that have started them (even a poor facial expression can set us off) but we end up saying some really horrible things to each other. 

For some context, I was in a bad car crash in 2021 the same week we started talking and up until about a year ago I thought I was OK mentally. I now believe I have PTSD and it is showing itself in growing irritability, anger and explosive rage during arguments. I have never hit her, thrown things or anything like that and it will stay that way. 
The crash claim is ongoing and I am eagerly awaiting therapy, whenever that may be. 

2 nights ago we had an argument and some insults were thrown around both ways. Since then she has not wanted to be anywhere near me and we are essentially isolating ourselves from each other inside the house. I can't even ask if she wants a coffee without her asking me to leave her alone. 

I want this to work, I really do. I know that currently I am a problem but I need the help to get past it, both from her and therapy. 

I also can't help but feel a bit hard done by that she is ready to just throw it all away after 6 months of marriage and 3 years of being together before that. 
I've explained to her why I think I act the way I do and that it's not me. She knows deep down it's not but our experience so far is clouding that. 

I need advice to fix this. I know what I need for myself but I don't know what I need for my marriage. I've tried to talk to her but it fails every time.

Within our first week dating, he vented to me that he feels insulted a girl he’s known is only interested in him now that he’s lost weight and got a girlfriend.

This is his first time being in a serious relationship since then, and she has:

-  Made comments like “I’m going on a date with someone that looks like you,” or “I’m going on a date with someone you knew in middle school, he’s so funny just like you” or “I’m at this guys house that you knew, we didn’t do anything sexual yet but he’s so much like you!”

- Calls all the time, including in the middle of the night 

- Has said “oh, nevermind” when she calls and finds out he’s with me

- When he was having a birthday party, she asked if she could come and he said that’s not a great idea and she got upset and said, “I’ve known you longer than her!” 

I told him I wasn’t personally comfortable with this behavior, and he distanced himself from her and stopped responding to her texts whenever they were suggestive. However, he thought it would make me less stressed if he muted her texts and deleted their text history, which he let me review and they were innocent texts. 

I asked him if he actually thinks she’s a decent person and wants to be friends with her, but is saying he doesn’t because he thinks that’s what I want to hear. I said that he knows her more than I do, and if he wants to be friends with her, I’d be willing to meet her and figure it out. He said no, and that she’s actually a mean person but he doesn’t feel he can cut her off because she went to him when she was struggling with severe mental health and she has no other friends. I said okay, just please stop hiding things as it only makes it worse. I also asked him to please not hang out with her, as I’d only feel like her comments continue in person and if he doesn’t like even really enjoy her as a person, I don’t see a reason to put himself in that position. 

(Note: He has integrated me closely with his friends and family, allowing his family to get me gifts and invite me to holidays dinners. I feel like I wouldn’t bring someone that closely to my family if I wasn’t serious about the relationship. I don’t worry about infidelity with him, I think he’s a loyal person but his lack of firm boundary setting with this girl has frustrated me. Maybe I’m just too insecure about myself.) 

Months later, we were having a disagreement about the future (him and I have significant income differences and I have a lot more work experience/income than he does, which sometimes causes us to not be able to share the same sentiment about the future because he doesn’t feel capable of thinking about it until he gets his first job outside of a coffee barista). I mentioned breaking up, which felt like a terrible mistake and I immediately took back. He reasonably felt upset, disposable and a lower sense of confidence. But I told him I would ensure to help him feel more secure and that I regretted it greatly. He agrees to stay together and I’m motivated to make him feel more valued.

A few days later, he tells me the day after I broke up with him, he called that girl and she invited him out to drinks and he went. I asked him if anything happened that would hurt me, he said nothing physical happened, but he did vent about us which he felt was inappropriate and she made a comment about what sex with him was like. He said he ignored it. And after the dinner, he immediately felt regret and that he just went for validation/attention. He knew after that that I was right about why she should be far from our relationship.

I forgave him for breaking this boundary I set to not hang out with her, because I understand I hurt him by breaking up with him (though at the time he went to see her, we had already agreed that we’d stay together). But I did ask that he block her. He agreed, but dragged his feet about it. I followed up two weeks later and when he finally did it, she cursed him out and called him a terrible friend. He later got emotional and cried because cutting off people is not something he does.

This feels like a problem that was born out of insecurity and search for validation, at least for me, if not both of us. And my hope is him and I can move forward and give each other that more, rather than from an outside source. But I’m worried asking him to block someone (who likely doesn’t want to be friends again) might have damaged our relationship more than it helped. Was I wrong to ask him to block her? If so, is it possible to make things better?

TLDR: My boyfriend of 9 months was friends with an ex from their teen years, who started acting in ways that felt disrespectful to our relationship as soon as he started dating me. My boyfriend distanced himself by my request, but when we had relationship issues (and I regretfully brought up breaking up which I immediately took back), he went to get drinks with her the next day. As a result, I asked him to block her and I’m worried that this was a huge red flag on my part. I’m determined to make this relationship worked but fear I might have caused more damage than good, as he ended up seeming really sad to cut off someone he’s known since his teens.

I (19f) started working at a restaurant in march. On my first day I saw a guy (21m) . He’s tall and handsome.  I thought „damn“ and I was immediately attracted to him. Fun part is we’re from the same country (he’s mixed)and he was just very extroverted and I developed a silly work crush on him. Nothing serious. 

One day at work I was told to clean something but he did it for me. The restaurant was empty to he asked me to sit outside with the others and gave me his jacket and I remember I flinched but then I realised it was him fixing it for me. And he didn’t wear one. He made sure I got free food when I got home too. 

And he taught me how to make coffee and how to pour beer even tho he’s a waiter and I’m a bartender and one time he was holding my hand when I held the glass and we both poured it in and I let him bc why not? I have a friend who knows a guy that’s knows him and she asked him if he was single and the guy said no. He’s not a relationship type. So I thought it was my time to plot😭

Anyways he kept encouraging me at work and a few weeks ago he asked me to do his hair for his birthday. Mind you I’ve never claimed to be a stylist. I’ve never done hair in front of him before and we have a black cook and another black bartender and I was asking myself why he didn’t ask them. And the bartender and I talked about stuff and she told me he has a gf that’s also mixed and I was confused bc he never acted like anyone who had a gf. 

I went with him to do his hair at his friends place. We talked a lot and I told him I’ll go to a summer festival with my friend and he told me about his time there and how his woman was calling his phone 24/7. That’s how I found out he had a gf. Thank god this wasn’t a serious crush but still. And he suggested I got to a festival in France bc ill deffo meet my type there😭😭 idk why he said that. But he didn’t make me feel excluded. I didn’t want money from him bc he’s my co worker and we good. So no? And I’m not a pro. He said I should do hair fr and even rated it a 10 for it being my first time. All his friends said it’s clean and good. And he said he’ll definetly come again and that he can help me do this fr. I asked him why he wanted me to do it bc he’s never seen me do anything. He said even the cook suggested to do it for him and that he has like 5 hairstylists bc he does his hair all the time (he does) but he gages who is free and when he thought about it  I was the most reliable one???? I don’t understand 

He invited me to his birthday this Friday and took us out to eat (wit his friends) and even then he was glancing at me every now and then. Mind you the whole crush thing disappeared bc I don’t go for taken people ofc and he was actually pretty cool. So were his friends. He wanted me to stay longer bc he wanted to get birthday stuff and go to a bar at night but I left earlier. I wanted to know the details for the birthday bc I wanted to go with a friend and it’s another friends birthday that same day. I wished him happy b day on Monday he said thank you and then I asked if he could give me the details and he hasn’t responded til now. I thought it’s bc he’s busy but today another friend worked with him and she told me he took down the hair. It might have not lasted that long bc I didn’t cake up his hair with gel but I think that’s the reason he didn’t respond. 

I’m not saying that he wanted anything from me but I’m asking myself if it was really about the hair??? I was just excited for the birthday party bc I missed being under black spaces but I don’t understand the whole thing ",0,1747253731.0,blackladies,1,0.33,False

I’ve been quiet because I wanted to respect your space.. It’s been over a month since everything fell apart, and I’ve spent that time grieving, healing, reflecting, and despite it all, hoping. I didn’t want to reach out without giving both of us time to breathe.

And while I’ve come to understand that love alone isn’t always enough, it doesn’t change that what we had was real. At least for me it was real. 

I’m finally reaching because the door I left open can’t stay open forever. And if there’s a part of you that misses what we had, wants to catch up over coffee or even just to find closure, I’d be open to hearing it.

If not, I’ll take the silence now as permission to close the door and move on and let go of the hope I’m holding onto.

There’s this girl 25F I worked with on the same project for the past two years. We hadn’t interacted much before, but recently we started talking more—mostly about work, switching jobs, and sometimes casual stuff too.

She asked for help updating her Naukri profile, and that’s actually the main reason we planned to meet at the office today. We had only seen each other once in person around 6 months ago during an annual office event. Other than that, I hadn’t seen her because she doesn’t have a display picture on Teams.

Whenever she needed help, I used to ask for her personal email to send study materials, but I never had the courage to ask for her number. One day she called me for work—I didn’t recognize the number, and that’s how we ended up officially exchanging numbers.

So today, I casually asked if she could come to the office to meet. She agreed—even though this office is closer to me and a bit inconvenient for her, she still made the effort to come, which I really appreciated. I got a bit late, but she still waited for me.

We chatted for a bit about how the project wrapped up nicely after all these years. Then we went for lunch—I asked her what she felt like eating and we went to a South Indian place. I paid for the food. After lunch, she stopped by a café and brought two cold coffees—her treat. That small gesture meant a lot.

She was quite talkative during lunch—sharing stories about her personal life, her friends, and more. I also talked a bit, but mostly I was just listening and enjoying the vibe.

We got back to the office and continued chatting for a while. Later in the evening, I asked her if she wanted tea—she said yes. She tried to pay this time but I insisted and paid. After that, we walked around 1.5 km to the bus station together, still talking. It felt really nice—she was just casually sharing her thoughts and stories, and even though I didn’t always know what to say, I was happy just being around her.

Since she came all the way to this office just because I asked, I even offered to book an Uber for her while we were leaving. I felt I should do something since she came all this way. But she politely refused, said there’s no need—she’ll manage and actually enjoys walking to the bus stop.

Right before we parted ways, I gave her a small chocolate and told her to take care. I also said a proper goodbye since we might not get to meet again—I’m leaving, and she’s still around, figuring out her next move. Later I texted her “Hey, did you reach?” and she replied, “Yes, just now.”

Now I’m honestly confused. I don’t know if we’re just friends or if there’s something more. In my 3.5 years of working, this is the first time I’ve spent this kind of time with a girl—talking, eating, walking—and it felt really good and meaningful.

I’m not sure if I have feelings yet, but she’s definitely a 10/10. Based on our conversations, I think she’s single, but I’m not 100% sure.

So now I’m just wondering… how do I take this forward? Are we friends? Could it turn into something more? I’m not sure how to label this or what to do next.

Some take the slow-and-steady route with SEO. Others pay to be seen right away with ads. Both work. The trick is knowing which one suits your business, your goals, and your budget. In this article, we’ll break down the pros and cons of SEO and paid ads in plain terms. No fluff. And by the end, you’ll have a clearer picture of which route to take in the SEO vs Paid Ads debate—and how to spend your budget wisely

# What Is SEO?

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s how you help people find you on Google without paying for ads. You do it by writing helpful content, making your website easy to use, and earning trust from other websites that link to yours. Bit by bit, Google starts to see your site as a good answer to people’s questions—and starts showing it higher in search results.

# Understanding Organic Search

When someone types a question or keyword into Google, the search engine decides which pages show up first. It looks at how useful your content is, how many other sites link to you, and whether your site runs well on phones and loads quickly. You don’t need to outsmart Google—you just need to show you’re helpful and reliable.

The beauty of SEO is that it builds over time. It might take a few months to see results, but when it starts working, it keeps bringing people to your site without needing more money from you every time they click.

# Pros And Cons Of SEO

Search Engine Optimization can save you money in the long run. You don’t pay for each visit like you do with ads. People also tend to trust organic search results more. The downside? It takes time. You won’t see instant results, and it needs regular upkeep to stay ahead of competitors or new algorithm changes.

# What Are Paid Ads?

Paid ads are what most people recognize as the sponsored listings at the top of Google or those ads that follow you around the internet or pop up in your social feeds. You pay to be seen, and the results can be fast.

# Understanding Pay-Per-Click (PPC)

PPC stands for Pay-Per-Click, and the name tells you how it works—you pay only when someone clicks your ad. It’s a quick way to get eyes on your business, especially if you’re launching something new or trying to reach a specific audience fast.

There are a few different ways businesses use PPC. Some go with search ads—those short links you see at the top of Google when you search for something. Others try display ads, which are the banner-style ones you spot on blogs or news sites. Then there are social media ads, which pop up in your Instagram feed or show as sponsored posts on LinkedIn and Facebook.

To get those ads in front of people, businesses place bids. You tell the platform how much you’re willing to pay when someone clicks your ad. The higher the bid and the more relevant your ad, the better your chances of getting that spot. It’s a bit like an auction—but one where budget, timing, and quality all matter.

# Pros And Cons Of Paid Ads

One of the best things about paid ads is how quickly they work. You can set one up in the morning and see results by afternoon. You also get to be specific—showing your ad to certain age groups, cities, job roles, or interests. That kind of control helps you spend your money where it matters.

But ads come with trade-offs. Once your budget runs out, your visibility disappears. If you're not careful, the costs can sneak up. And if people keep seeing the same ad too often, they start to ignore it—what marketers call ad fatigue.

# SEO vs. Paid Ads: Key Differences

So how do SEO vs Paid Ads really compare? They both bring in traffic, but they do it differently, and each one suits different goals. Understanding how SEO works over time and how paid ads deliver instant results can help you choose the right path for your business.

# Cost Comparison

With SEO, you invest time and effort upfront—writing good content, fixing your site, earning backlinks. You don’t pay for every click, but it takes a while to build momentum. Paid ads, on the other hand, cost money right away. You pay every time someone clicks, but the results are immediate.

Think of SEO like planting a garden. You dig, water, and wait, but eventually, it starts growing on its own. Paid ads are more like ordering takeout—fast and convenient, but it costs you every time.

For example, a small local bakery might spend $300 a month on SEO help and start seeing results after a few months. That same business could drop $300 on Facebook ads in a week and get instant traffic—but once the money’s gone, so are the clicks.

# Traffic & Click-Through Rate (CTR)

Both SEO and ads drive traffic, but people interact with them differently. Search ads appear right at the top of Google, which helps if you want attention fast. Still, many users scroll past the ads and click on the organic results below because they feel more trustworthy.

Studies show that while paid ads grab around 2-3% CTR on average, the top organic result can pull in over 25%. That doesn’t mean paid ads don’t work—they just work better for some goals, like flash sales or limited-time offers.

SEO builds trust. Ads grab attention. Together, they can cover both bases.

# Long-Term vs. Short-Term Strategy

SEO and paid ads both have their place, but they run on very different timelines.

SEO takes time. You won’t see results right away, but the work you put in today pays off down the line. As your content gains traction and your site earns more trust, you start to show up more often in search results—without having to keep spending.

Paid ads, on the other hand, are built for speed. You can launch a campaign today and see traffic within hours. That makes PPC great for time-sensitive goals—like announcing a new product, running a flash sale, or filling seats for an event.

Let’s say you run a new coffee shop. If you want to build a strong local presence that shows up on Google Maps and in “best cafes near me” searches, SEO will help over time. But if you're opening next week and want to spread the word fast, ads on Instagram or Google will give you that quick visibility.

# When To Use SEO vs. Paid Ads

So, which should you pick? It really depends on what you’re trying to achieve and how fast you need results.

# Choosing The Right Strategy For Your Business

If you’re building something for the long haul—like a blog, a service-based business, or an online store—then SEO deserves your attention. It creates a foundation that brings in traffic, even while you sleep.

Paid ads are better suited for moments when timing matters. Running a seasonal sale? Launching a product? Trying to beat a competitor to the punch? Paid ads help you get noticed quickly.

Some businesses lean into one strategy more than the other, but many find a balance that works. It’s not always either/or.

# Combining SEO & Paid Ads

SEO and PPC don’t have to compete. In fact, they’re stronger together.

Let’s say someone finds your blog post through SEO, reads it, but doesn’t make a purchase. With retargeting, you can show them an ad later—maybe with a discount or reminder—and bring them back. That’s one way paid ads can follow up on the traffic that SEO brings in.

Or maybe you're bidding on a high-competition keyword where it’s hard to rank organically. You can run a search ad for now while working on SEO behind the scenes. Over time, once your page starts ranking, you can cut back on the ad spend.

Plenty of successful businesses do both. A clothing brand might use SEO for style guides, and ads for promoting new collections. A therapist might write blog posts that rank organically and run Google Ads to attract people searching for immediate help.

In the end, the smartest strategy is the one that fits your goals, budget, and timeline—and keeps your business growing, both today and tomorrow.

# Measure Your Success: SEO vs. Paid Ads

Once your strategy’s in motion, the next step is checking what’s working—and what needs tweaking. Tracking your results helps you understand if your money and time are paying off, and where to adjust for better performance.

# Tracking Performance Metrics

With SEO, look at how many people are visiting your site through organic search, which pages they visit most, and how long they stick around. Google Analytics and Google Search Console are great tools for this. They show your top keywords, traffic sources, and how your rankings change over time.

For paid ads, Google Ads and social media ad dashboards show how many people see your ads, how many clicks, and how much each click costs. You’ll want to track things like impressions, click-through rates (CTR), and conversions—whether that’s a sale, a sign-up, or a phone call.

The big question? ROI—return on investment. For SEO, you’re measuring how much long-term traffic and business you get compared to your time and content costs. For paid ads, it’s how much revenue you’re getting for every dollar spent.

# Optimizing For Better Results

Neither strategy works well on autopilot. The best results come from regular check-ins and small tweaks.

With paid ads, A/B testing helps. Try different headlines, images, or calls to action to see what gets better clicks or conversions. Sometimes, just changing a few words in your ad makes a big difference.

With SEO, keep improving your content. Update older posts, add fresh keywords, and fix anything slowing your site down. Over time, these small efforts add up to better rankings and more visitors.

Whether you’re using ads or SEO—or both—watching your results closely helps you make smarter decisions and avoid wasting money.

# Conclusion: Which One Is Right For You?

SEO and paid ads both have their strengths. SEO builds long-term trust and brings in steady traffic over time. Paid ads deliver fast results and let you target exactly who you want, when you want.

If you’re in it for the long haul, SEO gives you a solid foundation. If you need quick wins—like promoting an event or launching a new product—ads can help you get noticed fast.

And honestly? Many businesses find the best results by using both. SEO brings people in naturally, while ads help you stay top of mind or reach those who didn’t convert the first time.

The key is knowing your goals. Think about your timeline, your budget, and what you need most right now. Then, test, adjust, and find the mix that works best for your business.

# FAQs

# Is SEO Better Than Paid Ads?

SEO offers long-term traffic without paying per click, making it ideal for sustainable growth. Paid ads bring immediate visibility but stop working once the budget runs out. SEO is better for long-term value, while paid ads work well for quick results, product launches, or time-sensitive campaigns.

# Do Paid Ads Affect SEO?

Paid ads don’t directly affect SEO rankings. Google treats organic search and paid advertising separately. However, running ads can indirectly help SEO by driving traffic, increasing brand awareness, and boosting engagement, which may lead to more organic links and improved site metrics over time.

# What Is The Difference Between SEO And Pay-Per-Click?

SEO focuses on improving your site’s organic ranking to attract free traffic over time. Pay-per-click (PPC), like Google Ads, charges you for each click. SEO is slower but long-lasting. PPC gives immediate visibility but requires constant budget allocation to maintain traffic and visibility.

# Do You Pay When Someone Clicks An SEO Listing?

You don’t pay for clicks on SEO listings. Organic search results are free, and your traffic comes without a cost per click. The main investment in SEO comes from time or money spent on content, optimization, and technical improvements—not for individual visits.

# Is SEO Better Than Google Ads?

SEO is better for long-term results and brand authority. Google Ads work better for fast visibility and targeted campaigns. Choosing between them depends on your goals. For consistent, ongoing traffic, go with SEO. If you need fast leads or are testing a product, try Google Ads.

# Is Paying Someone To Do SEO Worth It?

If done well, yes. Skilled SEO professionals like us can help you rank higher, attract qualified traffic, and increase conversions over time. It’s a long-term investment. Just make sure they follow best practices and focus on measurable results, not quick hacks or shady link schemes.

# What’s The Difference Between SEO Vs Paid Ads?

The core difference in the SEO vs Paid Ads debate lies in timing and cost. SEO takes time but brings long-term traffic without paying for every click. Paid Ads, like Google Ads, offer immediate visibility—but once the budget runs out, so does the traffic.

# SEO Vs Paid Ads Cost: Which One Makes More Sense For Small Businesses?

When comparing SEO vs Paid Ads cost, SEO may seem more affordable over time. You invest in content and optimization once, and it keeps driving traffic. Paid Ads require ongoing spending. If you stop paying, your traffic disappears—fast.

# SEO Vs Google Ads: Which Is Better For Visibility?

In the SEO vs Google Ads conversation, Google Ads win for instant reach. You can show up at the top of search results within hours. SEO takes longer but brings sustainable visibility.
