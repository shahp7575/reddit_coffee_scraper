However, I find that I have a very dull headache in the morning before I take my medication.

Then when I take my medication within the hour it goes.

I take my medication at 11.30am as my day doesn't start until lunchtime so I've found there is no point taking it when I'm not doing much in the morning.

I drink 4 litres of water a day and the water I buy has some sodium in it and I don't drink coffee anymore.

I'll have a cup of matcha which contains 30mg of caffeine 4 hours before I take my medication and another one 6 hours after my medication and I've found this has no jittery effects on me or anything.

My parents divorced when I (M20) was 7 months old. My father started drinking a lot and did reckless and crazy stuff. I was removed from him for a couple of years before he worked his way back into my life. By the time I was every other week at his house, I was old enough to start remembering everything about him and none of it was good. He was verbally abusive on his best day, he called me p\*ssy a lot and queer in the negative way. He'd get physical on his worse days.

When I was 7 he ended up marrying some woman who argued with my mom a lot and tried like hell to make me think she was my second mom. My father mostly ignored her and knocked her up (4 times in 4 years) and drank and verbally abused us and physically abused me.

The woman my father was married to tried to treat me like her own and when mom fought my father in court his wife, now ex-wife, argued with her because she expected my mom to trust her and to let her take care of me every other week. She thought it wasn't fair if I was taken away from her and her kids who are my half siblings.

But after a couple of years mom was able to strip all my father's access to me and I no longer had to go over there. So all in all his ex-wife was in my life for 3, almost 4 years. She was pregnant when I last went over to my father's house.

My father ended up taking off and my mom and father's ex wife fought in court because she wanted some kind of custody or visitation and my mom refused to let her have any. I honestly wanted nothing to do with her or her kids. I know they're my half siblings and we share some blood (same father and all) but I just wanted my father out of my life and I never grew attached to this woman or my half siblings. I never actually bought that she was my second mom or that we were all a family.

I haven't seen or heard from my father since mom got custody of me and all I know is he left without really telling anyone where he was going. My life improved so much with him out of my life and I knew about his ex-wife and other kids but I never thought about bringing them into my life. 

A few weeks ago his ex-wife found one of my socials and she asked if we could meet up and talk. She told me she wanted to be in my life again and for me to know my half siblings. She told me they knew all about me and it would be great if I could come around and be the brother they never got to experience. She said she loved and missed me too and was hoping that I would understand she didn't choose to stay out of my life, but instead she was pushed out by my father first but also by my mom. She told me mom felt threatened by her presence and she never wanted to leave me.

I told her I was glad to be away from all of them when mom won custody and that she didn't do anything wrong but I never felt the way she wanted me to and I wasn't interested in any kind of relationship today. Her next few messages were kinda desperate and asking to at least meet her for coffee and see if we can't figure something out and even if we don't have any relationship after this I could at least have a relationship with my half siblings. I told her I really wasn't interested. She asked me why I was so cold and did I not appreciate her doing all she could for me back in the day. I told her she wanted to keep me where my father was abusing me and it was selfish and she was only thinking of herself and her kids, not me. She claimed I was poisoned by mom and that mom did the very same thing.

1q92pcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1q92pcb/i_love_bed_rotting_part_3/,"I love bed rotting, part 3.","To Whom it May Concern,

last week I didn't spend a lot of time in bed. I was working (from home) and went to see movies every day. Going to cinema is another thing I love. It started snowing last Sunday and it didn't stop until Wednesday. I was free last Tuesday and cooked delicious bean stew with sausages and threw snowballs from my balcony. Stews, another thing I love that make life better.

I was sober from January 1st, but yesterday after work I drank (a lot of) red wine and took some Xanax. I did this in bed, ofcourse. I won't drink today and I'm planning to stay sober for another 7 days, but I will definitely take remaining 1mg of Xanax later  today. Yesterday in the evening I also took some portraits of delivery driver who was from India. He was cool with it, I explained him that I'm a photographer and that I'm working on a surreal conceptual photographic diary which will be published as a book when it's finished.

Today is bed rotting day. No hangover from yesterday because I'm a professional. I will spend whole day in bed. I just made a big cup of hot coffee. Not the instant kind, despite the fact there are some cheap random instant coffee brands that I love. I made it turkish style from ground coffee. I might read today. And drink more coffee. Strong, black coffee. Yesterday I drunkenly ordered a lot of those triangle shaped gas station sandwiches, hence the Indian. Brand sold in my country is delicious. Another thing I'm passionate about.   

Window in my bedroom is wide open and cold air is caressing parts of my body that aren't under a duvet. I'm completely naked. Sounds of people showeling snow, birds, cars and an airplane are coming from outside and Sun is peeking through clouds. I had a very refreshing cold shower before I made coffee and I'm planning on taking a couple more hot and cold showers today. Currently it's 1:38 p.m.

Tomorrow I might meet my best friend. We went to cinema together on Thursday and my girlfriend couldn't come with us because she had diarrhea.",1,1768047592.0,confessions,0,1.0,False
1q92p0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q92p0e/i_cant_get_over_my_first_love/,I can't get over my first love,"I wanted to post this for a while because I can't tell anyone in real life. I know I will get a lot of hate for what I'm about to say but I can't handle keeping it inside anymore.

I (F26) dated my first love when I was 16 for a year. It was a crazy ""puppy love"" kinda thing. Very intense, we argued but we were also making out for 3 hours. The classic first love dynamic. Too young to have a stable relationship but the feelings were real. We ended things because I've caught him texting a girl and we tried to make it work after that but we were both so immature I told him after a few months I don't want to do it anymore. So after a bit more than a year it was over.

Right after it we both got in new relationships, they lasted a few years. He would text me every once in a while (like once a year) and we would text for a few weeks (hiding it from our partners). No nudes or anything but there was some flirting and stuff. Our attraction is undeniable. But in our fashion we would always then get into an argument and stop talking for a year until he texted again.

Fast forward to now. We both have ""new"" partners. He's been with his girlfriend for 2 years and I've been with my boyfriend for almost 5. I love my boyfriend and I want to build a future with him. We are on the same level on almost everything. Today I went shopping for some clothes and I saw my ex with his girl and I've never seen her before. I haven't seen him in more than a year. We all just said hi. My heart started racing and I was sweating. Now I came home and my heart feels so heavy...

I've never cheated on my bf with my ex. But he has texted me since I've been with him but it was just a bit before he got into this relationship. He was all flirty, we had coffee without my bf knowing (i know it's bad) and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted me but I went home. The thing is that it can't work between us.  I know this sounds bad but there is a huge intellectual gap (think I'm doing PhD and he barely finished high school). He has a really good job with good salary so it's not about the money. It's just we don't have much to talk about. It didn't bother me when I was 16 but it would now. 

So I know that it wouldn't work. I'm happy with my bf. Why can't I stop thinking about him? Why do I feel so bad now that I saw him with his gf? I feel like i will never be as attracted to anyone as I was to him when I was 16, full of hormones and not a single care in the world. I admit I'm still attracted to him but fully aware it wouldn't work. In a weird way just knowing he wants me makes me feel so good. Like whenever he would text me before and I would see he still wants me... I would feel so confident and empowered. Now I think he's really serious about this new girl. And I want him to be happy. But I'm dreading the day I find out he proposed. I don't want to marry him. But I don't want him to forget me. 

I don't know what I'm asking. I don't know why I'm writting this. I just know I can't say it out loud. Does anyone ever really get over their first love? Is it normal that the attraction is still there? I don't know if it is normal for me to feel this way. Thank you for reading. I know it doesn't make much sense.

I got up from my seat to go get coffee with my friend who was in the seat next to me, and left my bag zipped up under the seat. It feels naive looking back but I've never had any problems before. We were in business class and were pretty close to the cafe car, maybe only one or two cars between us. My friend had to run back to the seats to grab something, so the only time in which the bags were actually unattended, were for maybe one or two minutes as we were both walking back from the cafe car.

The train stopped in- I'm pretty sure it was the Philadelphia stop but I couldn't say for certain- as we were walking back. I'm fairly confident that's when I was robbed. I didn't realize I was missing anything until I got to my hotel later that evening, and even after that I searched my house when I got back home insistent I had forgotten it or misplaced it. 

After exhausting all other possibilities, this is what I'm pretty confident happened: The thief was at the train stop when the train pulled in. They got on the business class car, swiped things from unattended bags, and got off before the train pulled out of the station. Or moved further in, I don't know. 

I know it was stupid of me to leave my bag unattended at all, but I've made my peace with it. This was about a month ago so some of the details are a little hazy. Hopefully someone else here can learn from my mistake. ",1,1768047411.0,Amtrak,1,1.0,False

# Intro

*****

*My understudy insists that instigation and cleanup efforts on the area have been remarkably successful at ‘keeping the fire from going out’. Those few stationed there have been begging for the assignment of a new Field Lieutenant. We have another two squads ready to ship out, and can try again. A fresh start for the state. This should be a healthy mix of recruits and heavy hitters, assembled to capitalize on the recent turbulence.*



*This begs what to do about the last remnants of the old. With the near-total loss of her former squad, one might expect an outburst of sorrow, grief, even rage. Instead, Jackal has pivoted quickly and made the point of her own necessity, and requested not only reassignment, but promotion.*



*If it were up to Him, he’d likely refuse and say: ‘insists upon herself.’ I am now in the position to decide, and see the results of going without were subpar, and acknowledge she might have brought something special to the lost squad. The presented plan with her application conforms neatly to overall objectives for the state.*



*While her case is solid, it is extremely concerning how quickly she, as Field Lieutenant, has seemingly moved on from the loss. Whether such an attitude of using others to achieve personal aims is from nature or nurture is an academic question that we cannot test given the subject’s background, but does seem to strike me as ‘disturbingly familiar’.*



*The only question that remains is: Will we see a similar lack of production under this new squad, and let the moment slip? For want of better options at the moment, and given internal loyalty concerns, we will dispatch her to lead this far-flung expedition on a wait-and-see trial.*



*Fault cannot be laid at her feet for the loss, but the total collapse without her presence lends support to the decision I’ve enclosed. Given the potential necessity of locality, a closer reassignment is being considered. I will dispatch my understudy to monitor and facilitate. Who knows, perhaps he can corroborate my unsubstantiated feelings by working well together with our new Field Officer.*

Natalie trotted over. “Well done,” she commented dryly, eyes wandering over the synthetic blood and guts I’d gotten all over me. It was stickier, thinner,and the wrong color, but was otherwise a faithful simulacrum. “So, now that we’re finally alone together, would you mind sharing your grand, master plan, O Emperor?”



“I would,” I grumbled darkly. “Mostly because I think I’ve been left out of some crucial details, and can’t help but wonder if I’ve been stabbed in the back.”



I didn’t care that I’d spent a week bumming favors and references off of quislings and their thunderous but ineffectual replacements. [*Only the honorable can confer honor*](https://firstthings.com/the-honor-deficit/). Every single referral meant less to me than an equal number of insurgent recruits showing up to be trained. One was cheap words from a coward, the other was an unforgeable show of bravery.



“Again?” Natalie whined. “What, did Mister Emperor not divine the chicken guts correctly? You know the Ides of March was a few months ago, right?”



I shot her a look of irritation at how she so unkindly repaid my ancient history lessons, only to be matched by her own indignation, and so I decided to start into a trot, ‘as ordered.’ Sure, it was petty, and her eyes flashed as she defiantly matched me step for step.



We both knew that wouldn’t last long.



“I was going to pick the Navy, by the way. And I can’t leave you alone to your own devices up there.”



I wanted to reply ‘I can handle myself,’ but really a mix of guilt and other feelings were already forming an unpleasant ball in the pit of my stomach.



“So, what is the plan? You go up, you get the ‘military secrets’, and then what?”



“I wash out. Not hard. Not complicated. I’m a boy, a human boy. You guys get to believe your system’s not showing any fairness or favoritism, I get what I need and end up shuttled back here. Call it getting Homesick, or whatever. Then I find out what the hell happened to the part of the plan where they tell me why they left out that I’d have to pick a branch to study.”



My girlfriend blew out a noisy breath of relief. “Oh good, I was worried you’d ask us to buy out your service.”



“I don’t-” I paused. “Wait, you would do that if it came to it?”



“I-” Now Natalie stumbled, almost dropping her tempo as it got a bit harder to keep talking and running. “No, maybe?” She said, clearly trying to evaluate the possibility.



I matched pace, and soon we were just at an easy walking pace.



I didn’t really understand her family’s dynamics when it came to money. It seemed like it was available whenever her mother needed it, for anything. How far did that extend? Her father’s business was doing well enough, she’d said. Something to do with terraforming, which I thought gelled well with her mother’s secret work.



“Either way, that’s years off my life, that wouldn’t work.”



“Then why are you trying so hard?” She asked. “In training.”



“I want to learn everything I can. Response patterns. Expected response times and search patterns. How they train officers, what they put them through. Why they think the way they do. How they’re *supposed* to react when a bomb goes off, or someone starts shooting or gets shot and taken prisoner.” I knew what the Marines had tended to do, of course, but what if Delaware’s garrison was just really ill-prepared and we’d caught them off-guard after a year of peace? What if, given sufficient forewarning and refresher training course, they were now responding more capably in the other states we’d been deploying insurgent groups into? I had to know. “That means I don’t have the luxury of floundering around up there in remedial courses if I want to get all I can while I’m there.”



“So you can use it to kill.” Her words were quieter, but carried no less weight of accusation.



I knew this conversation was coming. It wasn’t the first time, and like an angry pimple, the sore kept boiling up no matter how much we bled it. “Sure,” I said. “That’s what I do. I kill, we kill. It’s what you’ll do, too, once you’re done up there. Or do you think all this is to stand around? Some box-ticking exercise on the path to greater things? A life lived where you’re only at home on your way to some gala or ball, some minor award ceremony for participating in society?”



“And you won’t?” Natalie asked. “You have a path in front of you now, Elias. A real one.”



I closed my eyes and grit my teeth. How long had I begged for one, growing increasingly anxious as my parents denied me any assistance in finding a path forward, any path at all? How many times had I laid out my hopes and dreams only for them to just nonchalantly or noncommittally wave them off? Now I had what I had once wanted, what other boys my age would kill for.



Of course, I had killed to achieve it, hadn’t I? I doubted I’d have gotten so many letters of referral or such an impressive resume, had I not had Gavin and Sullivan’s help. Amilita and I would not be so close, if she hadn’t had continued need of my services to explain humanity to her.



Slowly, I relaxed my clenched jaw, and let the gums ache pleasantly for a moment where I’d ground my molars. Yes, I may have had a path in front of me, but I would never lose sight of how I’d gotten there, or what it actually meant and represented. If I took it, I would become a loose end. I’d have to leap from Earth’s gravity well and never return. I’d lose my humanity in the process. Was that what Natalie was asking of me? To forget I was human? To pretend the path Elias was *supposedly* on was one I could take?



All I’d have to do is close my eyes and pretend I wasn’t running away.



I’d never been good at that. It was why I’d mouthed off so much in class.



“Life here…” I started, and let it out with a deep sigh. “...it’s complicated. I’d have to still be me, and who and what I am is human. I can never forget that. I need a home, Natalie. A place to belong. And as much as you’d make me feel welcome at home, every time I’d step out of the house, I’d be a curiosity at the least. It might be fun for a bit, but if I leave here, I could never come back. I could never face Earth knowing how I’d left it.”



“You will have left it as a hero, admired by most as Elias Sampson, the first of many to be brave enough to travel offworld. Boys would look up to you, want to be you. They’d follow in your footsteps.”



I wanted to hurl, and it had nothing to do with reaching my fatigue limit or sun stroke.



“Besides, Earth might turn out okay in your absence,” she tried again. “The weight of the world on your shoulders was a punishment.” Technically, he’d been meant to carry the heavens, but now wasn’t the time for pedantry. “What have you done as a boy to warrant that?”



Fine. We’d play out her little scenario.



“I leave Earth as it is and it either throws off the Shil’vati, in which case I can never return to my people as anything but a traitor and sellout, in which case I have no home. Or it fails without me, and Earth falls to the Empire. Earth is as the Shil’vati have remade it, and I still have nowhere in the galaxy to call home.”



There was only one path in front of me.



“Besides,” I continued. “If I did quit on people, would you still want me? You want loyalty. You have me.” The shil’vati kept trying to pry away the bits of humanity that they found irritating, and keep the parts that were helpful. I could understand the simple and understandable desire, but it also felt like greed and a lack of understanding.



I saw the wavering uncertainty in her eyes.



I couldn’t, and wouldn’t ask her to walk away from the Empire if it was in dire straits, even if I could offer her a similar path under a new life away from her people. Whether that meant we were doomed or not, I didn’t know, and for once found a topic I couldn’t bring myself to even consider.



“This is bigger than just me. The situation here, the state of humanity? It’s not good. Everyone’s a stranger to each other now. You don’t know if your neighbor’s on your side or going to turn on you for overhearing something, and they’re making that same equation in their head. That has become the only meaningful thing we have left in common, even when we’re Delawareans. The differences have begun to amount to so much more than our commonalities. At least, before, we were supposedly made to feel like we were part of some great civilizational, national effort.”



“Supposedly?” Natalie asked.



“Yeah.” I shrugged. “I feel like it was there, in the old books I read, though. In the speeches, old photographs, in the words of people born high and low showing the utmost respect they could, and receiving it in turn. This world, or at least this corner of it was theirs, and they cared for it as far as they could with what they had and of what they knew. Now there’s this pervasive feeling that it’s all someone else’s.” I tried not to look too hard at her, but when I caught sight of her about to jump in, I pressed on anyway.



“Back then, violence against your fellow man wasn’t excusable, because if someone did something so bad, the state would come down on them in retribution. Now we are mistreated, and mistrust our own state to do anything but cover it up. We see ourselves as prisoners of the nation, rather than at its head. We have no home, spare this one. and don’t exactly trust the shil’vati to step in and disband our government and then meaningfully improve things.”



“I wonder what happened to that ‘monopoly on violence’? You used to talk so much about that to me in the library.” Now she was getting sarcastic, staring at me for a moment just to get her point across before trying to pour on a brief burst of speed with what I knew had to be the last of her energy.



I didn’t glare. I just kept silently pacing her. Once we  I stared back at her, silent, and let the moment drag on and on. It wasn’t long before she remembered how I had limped along in the hallway at Talay. How she’d had to step in and intervene so I would get the help I needed after a Marine had wronged me. From there, I’m sure she went to the obvious of how Ministriva hadn’t been brought to justice by their system, but by rather pointedly losing the monopoly on violence. From there, the state had never gotten it back.



Finally, she couldn’t look me in the eyes any longer. “Sorry.”



“We keep having this conversation.” In spite of my best efforts, the statement still came out like an accusation, so I tried to clarify. “I don’t want you to apologize. I just want you to accept what is, instead of what might be, if circumstances were different. You don’t have to like it, but I’m not going to run away and abandon my humanity.”



Natalie frowned, and scratched at a tusk. “I just don’t like where you’re so dead-set on going in life. It’s self-destructive, when you have other opportunities in front of you. A life with me. A galaxy to explore. When you turn your nose up at them, it feels like you’re rejecting me.”



*Where can I go on this path, Natalie, where what I just said isn’t the case? Where is there a place for me? With my homeland conquered, I am now as at home here as I would be among the stars, but that does not make me eager to jump for them, so much as it does make me want to take a torch to here and rebuild from its ashes. What else am I to do* ***but*** *fight?*



Rather than let my thoughts spill out, I spun the conversation in a different direction instead. “Don’t you think you’re enough?”



She didn’t seem to grasp what I meant, staring in confusion for several seconds. “I don’t…” she paused.



“You put yourself in harm’s way for me, how many times? You didn’t have to. You didn’t do it to get yourself ahead, if anything it cost you and you did it anyway, without hesitating. You saw me going into this and you jumped in to be with me, by my side. You are enough of an opportunity in your own right, just by being here.”



She gave me a very human shrug, or at least tried to. “I just did what was natural.”



“You did what you felt was right. Who are you, Natalie Rakten?” I asked.



“I…”



“You don’t know,” I spoke more softly as I came a bit closer, feeling a bit cheesy but meaning every word. “But I do.” I planted a gentle kiss, my heart thudding.



I hoped she’d kiss back, but I hadn’t expected her to hold tight like a girl drowning at sea, long nails encrusted with dirt finding their way onto my chest in the late summer heat, before she started running her fingers over each pec, then her grip going up around my shoulders. I was being squeezed and then held onto with increasing strength and almost desperation.



I didn’t dare complain or wince, and just tried to hold her steady. I had to be her rock. If she washed out or had a meltdown, then where would that leave us?



“Unit One, Unit Two, bring it in!” Morsh called out over the wrist-comm that Natalie wore, ending the moment abruptly before I felt like it could even start for me.

  
Were these the sort of things people who loved each other wondered about one another?



Once more, I wished Larry was still around.



I came trotting up to the bodyguard back around to the rear of the house, and waited politely for Natalie, before doubling back to help her make it up the small hill to where Morsh was waiting.



“Congratulations are in order,” Morsh said, looking right at me.



“That was fast,” I blinked. I hadn’t expected to hear at least until tomorrow.



“It was. One last fight before we call it a day, what do you say?”



I nodded, throwing up my fists in a guarded position. Natalie’s stance was far too wide, still breathless.



Morsh moved slowly, gentle motions more reminiscent of Tai Chi, trying to encourage us.



We started gently enough, though before long we were swinging for the fences. The huffs and grunts of effort, punctuated by the wet slap or thud of an impact catching.



“Come on!” Morsh urged us on as the fight reached a decent tempo. I felt like I could still go faster. I certainly remembered moving faster before, but that had been fight-or-flight. Was this the time, at last?



I feinted and Morsh bit, making an opening for Natalie, who actually followed through, managing to tag her bodyguard with a jab. Morsh wheeled around on Natalie, entwining both her hands and leaving her side completely wide open. I leapt in, only to realize the trap the bodyguard had laid when she shifted her momentum back toward me without even turning or looking.



Natalie had backed off, settling into a guard to ward off the expected attack that never came. My fist still managed to slam into Morsh’s eye socket, over her shoulder and barely miss her tusk- yet that rounded, well-muscled shoulder caught me just under the collarbone, and the impact pressed through my solar plexus, and sent me clean off my feet.



I felt my breath leave in a wheeze and I spun to the ground. I rolled before she could grab me, the back of her fingernails sliding over the skin-tight fabric in some cruel mimicry of Natalie’s earlier, no less frantic effort.



I got up to one knee and forced myself to keep going even as my lungs burned. Morsh hadn’t bet on my being back in the fight yet and had turned her back to me when Natalie shrieked in rage and charged right in, all sense of self-preservation abandoned. Morsh was ready to grapple her ward- but was taken by surprise when I crawled onto her back and clenched an arm across her neck.



Natalie broke through Morsh’s warding gesture and delivered a pair of fast body blows, then a snap-kick to Morsh’s leg. The overburdened bodyguard actually jolted, before standing upright with a roar and grabbing me by my shoulder, pinching it and prying me off like an irritating burr and holding me overhead.



I tried to fight the monstrous, vice-like grip, but with the wind still knocked out of me, it was all I could do to lock my ankles around her shoulders rather than let her throw me completely free, or worse, slam me against a thigh or knee.



Natalie threw herself into Morsh again, this time trying to tackle the bodyguard, which almost worked.



Almost.



Morsh took her free hand and scooped up my girlfriend, and then spun all three of us around, laughing. After a good dozen rotations, the bodyguard staggered to halt and let Natalie go, before more gently setting me back on my feet, all three of us staggering around like extras in a zombie flick.



*Not as bad as that time I got stuck spinning with the gravity belt until the charge pack ran out,* I reflected. *Close, but not quite.*



“Alright, alright, not bad. You two have good teamwork. The problem is, you’re predictable to anyone who thinks ahead of time.” Morsh chuckled and ruffled Natalie’s hair loose of its usual ponytail normally kept in place by a bright pink elastic band, now swapped for an honest to god camouflaged one. It was always weird little details I’d focus on when short of breath and high on adrenaline.



I just took the compliment from the titanic shil’vati for what it was. Natalie, however, had to argue.



“Elias has the faster reaction time.”



“Humans usually do. Prediction offsets that advantage enough.” I grimaced in acknowledgement. Morsh’s eyes brightened at my awareness of her point, before turning to her ward, who still looked like she was going to try and keep debating, as if we hadn’t just been spun around like toys. “He means it, by the way, when he says he’ll try and come to your rescue. It’s a bad habit of his you’re going to have to curb, one way or another. Anyway, better teamwork could help you two, and I’ve got an exercise to help you two bond a bit. You can prepare for it overnight. Consider it your take-home assignment.”



She knew I’d try and protect Natalie, and had factored for my faster reaction times, even. Just where had the Rakten family found Morsh?



I finally managed to ask through my heaving breaths, “what’s the exercise?”



“You’ll be camping out, and have three days to reach New Jersey. You’ll avoid all contact with the locals. If you accept any offered help or I see you engaging with them beyond attempts to elude, evade, and so on, then the exercise is over. If you are spotted by the authorities and I am contacted, again, the exercise is over. You will do your absolute best to avoid being spotted, is that clear?”



“Three days?” Shrieked Natalie.



I started trying to dead reckon the distance. As the crow flew, it wasn’t *that* bad, even for a Shil’vati. Of course, that assumed we walked along the road, which meant being spotted was a near-certainty.



Besides, we still had to get from the Delaware Shore over to New Jersey. There were a couple ferries while the Delaware Memorial Bridge was being rebuilt, and the other bridges across were very, *very* out of the way.



Actually, there was a pretty simple way to do this. “What about-”



“No bicycles,” Morsh added, seeing where my eyes had gone. “Assume you have only the usual field kit on you. I’ll add more details tomorrow, but just like in a real emergency, you can have a general plan, and then the details will change, leaving you in the lurch to handle the situation, and me to monitor how you grapple with that. Are we clear?”



So much for that idea, then. It hadn’t been a great one, but it would have at least solved part of the problem.



*From practically the northernmost spot in the state to the river…*



I said nothing more, lest I give her anything else to deny us. That was a long time to be out of contact with the insurgency. I could tell Gavin and Sullivan where I’d be, but do little about it without abandoning the mission.



*Damn you, Gavin. You too, Sullivan. I’ll send you both through basic training for this!*



“Is this really necessary?” I finally asked.



“Combat might mean you lose your pod and are on your own, with no warning at all, count yourselves lucky you even get a good night’s rest and time to be aware it’s even going to happen. You could be on an alien planet with no breathable atmosphere or useful cover. You’d still need to cover the same distance in hostile enemy territory to make it to the rendezvous, and you could even be injured in a crash after your transport was shot down, and you slept like shit the night before after an enemy patrol was spotted nearby. Would you rather we simulate that?” She popped her knuckles. “Pretend this is real, or there’s no point.”



I’d been lucky in every engagement to escape with little more than sore muscles, bumps and lumps so far. I almost volunteered to say: ‘whatever is the most realistic,’ but I could tell Natalie was wiped out already, and her argumentativeness likely had more to do with the new dynamic she had with Morsh than any real desire to prove herself ‘tough enough’. Right?



So I just kept quiet. Morsh was the instructor, and I’d defer to what she thought made for the best training.



Seemingly satisfied with our lack of an answer, she finally gave the final details.



“Elias, show up here tomorrow at midday. Now get on home before Nive makes taking you home in the car an order.”



I gave a salute, and a knowing, tired smile to Natalie before tromping across the lawn to where I’d left the bicycle, making sure I’d started rolling before I let the corners of my lips drop.



As soon as I had a leg over the frame, I was fuming.



Once this bullshit exercise was done, I was going to get answers. If I didn’t find those answers complete enough for my liking, I’d grab George and get them from the point of a rifle.

# Parting



It took me three times longer to get back home than it had for me to leave.



I arrived sweaty and bruised.



So tired I didn’t see or even notice my sister in the upstairs hallway until I almost walked into her, and then I leapt back on instinct, reflexively going for where I normally kept my knife. My hand slapped not-leather, and I was momentarily disoriented. Still, even in such a state, I felt sure I could take her.



Thankfully, she wasn’t in the mood.



“What had you out so late? And what’s with the getup?”



“Fuck off,” was my only answer, and I shoved right through her to get to the bathroom, already stripping off the form-fitting top. I had a rushed shower, collapsed in the bed, and after listening for any soft footsteps and checking that everything was clear, I blearily checked my burner phone and sent a message out-



*I’m On Target*

# Essay



Amilita couldn’t sleep.



She kept reviewing one piece she’d read today, one typed-in, and the other a rough scrawl in font still clearly unfamiliar to its writer, yet the words were artful in that strange, human way. The General related the two, trying to grasp the best understanding of humanity in their own words.



It argued that much like dueling was a substitute for noblewomen waging wars upon each other over slights, sports on Earth was something of a stand-in for regional combat. A ritualistic spiritual bloodletting. The name of the game was about Outlasting. Enduring. Cleverness and tactical ability. Their team sports, like their wars, continually evolved with devising new ways, methods, and patterns of play which could turn deadly in an instant.



Victory as a way to vanquish an enemy, who were ‘eliminated’ from their chance at glory. Injuries mounted as the ‘season’ wore on, marking each campaign as predictable as the tides. They even called recruitment a ‘draft.’ The parallels were there, the paper argued, and mankind had a tendency to seek violence though it could be ‘sublimated.’ He then compared boxing to shil’vati duelling, though Amilita felt fencing was the better comparison between the two, the writer had chosen this instead, though she struggled to understand *why.*



Perhaps it was on the subject of war and human nature than the question had casually asked. The response was noteworthy, coherent, and insightful. The shil’vati grammar displayed a grasp of grammar and subject matter that was way above his reading grade level, especially given the ‘setback years’ and months of school year’s disruption after the uprising.



Even with the young Lady Rakten’s tutoring, these themes were way above anything a young boy should have been able to conceptualize. Most his age were obsessive with fashion, fiction, or managing relationships, a small cohort where suitors jockeyed fiercely for the coveted first wife position. A growing cohort, though, were strangely leaning, no, *sprinting* toward the professions. She couldn’t blame them for taking the common offer of money with lucrative benefits such as company bodyguards and personal escorts all made such offers by prospective suitors superfluous. They tended to put themselves to work as best they could wherever they found themselves, motivated by some unseen and unspoken animus.



Amilita quietly suspected it was so their suitors would need to offer even more to stand out, their wives having to be all the more impressive. But what the General could understand less readily was why lately so many were gravitating toward military service. Especially after the Iron Tooth debacle, and subsequent attempt at a cover-up. Only the scale of the atrocity and plenty of missed evidence during the cleanup had forced punishments, and there were plenty of lone boys serving now in uniform without a whole crew to stand by them and give parallel testimonies. If Vanguard’s guest was who it was rumored to be, then this historical aberration would soon spread even further.



She held up the small collection of other aspirants’ top exams, comparing them. Those private academies’ best had all written works of peace, optimistic visions of the future, of trumpeting the end of the insurgency. All singing the same tones of praise and flattery, echoing their parentage. All of them had seemed to follow the exact same pattern, a formula designed to return the maximum possible grade, all of which had outscored the one paper in her other hand.



While *Vanguard* stressed how obedience was paramount, the most obedient were the girls of Padua, Ursula, top marks, when weighted by the curriculum. But that ignored what the school was really all about, right? She knew boys were the martial ones, here. Yet it was a ‘new age’, wasn’t it? But to overlook *the best*… or was she letting her maternal feelings for the boy interfere with her judgment? Protecting him when he was on the cusp of where he’d have to start protecting himself. And where better to learn?



The boy’s mental break, after the brutal interrogation by the rogue Lieutenant and brutalizing by the insurgency after living in their crosshairs for months was explainable, especially given his concern over his warnings being ignored repeatedly. He *was* just a boy, too, and by all accounts he had somehow apparently come out even stronger, even when tested by Morsh. The military academy would test him, too. Forge him, find impurities and hammer them out. Besides, war also looked unlikely, didn’t it? If nothing else, he would be a valuable diplomat, and no diplomat should be dispatched without having served.



She glanced at the cover of the book that Elias and Natalie had translated together. It featured a golden face on a sun, and a crescented silver moon, hand-drawn in a style she hadn’t seen before. So diverse were the arts here that she could spend a year reviewing that subject alone and still be taken by surprise.



War, slaughter, heroes, combat, horror, hope, perseverance, monsters, loss and pain. It had been incomprehensible, at first. Illogical. But the more she beat her head against the book, the more she found her own mind straining, warping, until she almost believed that a Minotaur could possibly exist, how she might fight one, what she might think if she were trapped in a maze with one. The meaning of sacrifice to a God that might throw thunderbolts as likely as seduce her and leave her with some monstrous spawn, or who might genuinely throw adversity in her way. One who, if that failed, might even step down from Olympus themselves. The more she read of the world of antiquity, the madness that came from it, the more she understood the odd sort of madness that took root inside humans and pushed them forward.



Gods and Goddesses were far from perfect. They were jealous, possessive, unfaithful, and fickle. They demanded appeasement, and were quick to dole out punishment. Even their modern, ‘all-loving’ “God,” had a tendency to “smite” and to demand tests of loyalty that even the Interior might consider space-cold. Nothing at all like the fair Goddesses, these were al written as fickle as a man’s heart and desires.



That most ancient of books had a line that haunted her still. “I had seven brothers in my father’s house, but on the same day, they all went to the house of Hades.” She’d had to put it down when she’d first read it, savoring the cultural gap it represented. That kind of loss was unimaginable, inconceivable. Families with two boys were considered blessed. Three unlikely enough to make the news and be the subject of fiction. To have four would make a minor celebrity in and of itself. Then, to lose Seven of them- all of them in war?



Seven?



It was unthinkable. It was horror on a scale that would have launched that family to war, and the outrage of the system on their behalf. It told of loss. It told of death and grief, and suffering.



What might cause him to have such a preoccupation?



But then, he grew up in war, came of age with stones falling into his atmosphere as everything he knew was upended. Perhaps, to him, it was normal to think on the topic. It would certainly help a military career, to have a mind capable of understanding these as natural rather than completely unknown, as Nataliska almost certainly did.



She looked up at the night sky projected on her ceiling, and thought long and hard.

Day 93.
Still nothing, I waited on the corner watching the snow fall and the wind sweep it along the sidewalk, occasionally sending small flecks of ice into my face. I pulled my jacket over my nose shaking off the cold. “Fuck”. Rubbing my hands together I shuffled across the street. There must be someone around here. The street lamps orange glow off the fresh snow lit up the dark causing me to question whether or not tonight really was a good night. I thought back to the orange cat and the lady that squirmed, I liked that cat. Maybe I should get a cat. Someone crossed the street two blocks ahead, moving slowly as they fought against the breeze. Maybe. 
As I took the left to start the chase, their pace seemed to quicken almost as if instinctively they knew someone was following them through the snow. The crunching under my feet felt almost deafening as the snow silently drifted down around me. I was slowly catching up making sure to keep a fair distance, but still, I couldn’t help myself as my heart rate quickened. I found my feet speeding up as the crunch of snow was quickly replaced by the beating of my heart, they were only 100 feet away now. He glanced over his shoulder. His pace quickened even further. I love when they fear me without even being sure as to why they fear me. 25 feet, he glanced back again. Funny looking face you’ve got. 10 feet, I could smell his cologne, thick and musky even through all his winter gear. 
Abruptly and almost violently he turned to his right and hastily reached for the latch on the chain link gate. I brushed against him as I passed, making a mental note of his home 2465 Woodcrest, yellow, short bushes along either side and a large bay window on the front left. His fear was thicker than his cologne. I couldn’t help but chuckle as the latch on his gate came down, a small twisted smile placed itself upon my lips. This should be fun.
Kicking the snow off my boots I unlocked my door, I could still see my breath as I entered. Must’ve left the heat off. I didn’t bother flicking on the light as I took off my boots, freezing tiles under my feet forced me to skip to my bed and quickly hop under the covers. I shook for a few minutes as the comforter slowly warmed. Tomorrow would be a long day at least there was someone to look forward to. 2465 Woodcrest…2465 Woodcrest...24...65...Woodcrest.... I slept like a baby that night.
Day 117
I should have got a sleeve with my coffee. The tips of my fingers burned as I passed it back and forth. My routine was simple; I watched his house, seeing who came and went. The mornings were usually slow, his mother would stop by at least once a week usually on tuesday or thursday drop him off some food, stay for a few minutes and then drive off in her little red PT Cruiser. In the afternoons, he would stop at home for lunch between the two jobs he had, it was easy to tell because his pants were always changed upon leaving. And in the evenings he returned home, usually pretty late, when the world seemed at a standstill and the darkness was only softened by the street lamps glow.
Patience is key in any situation like this, move to quickly and you’re bound to make mistakes but if you wait, and truly stalk your prey no one will ever see it coming. Even though I’d only been watching him for a couple weeks he had really begun to peak my interest. Other than his mother, he really didn’t seem to have anyone around him. No friends, no neighbors that came to visit, none of his co-workers ever came back with him, it didn’t seem like he had a girlfriend. He was alone, and I was going to make it so he never had the opportunity to change that.

In the third and fourth weeks of my surveillance I began to enter the property. Checking windows, peeking in on the layout trying to find the best path I could for a quick in and out. I knew I was leaving footprints but didn’t care, the fresh snowfall throughout the nights always left no trace of my presence in the morning. Only thing that was becoming troublesome was the amount of snow and how difficult it was becoming to move about the property at the speed I wanted to. Sometimes stupid shit happens, and I needed to be able to move quickly if it did.




Chapter I dont give a fuck day unknown
The searing pain as the blade slid its way into my shoulder was unbearable, the hot sear, the warmth as blood poured into my shoulder. I grabbed his hand as my warm soft bloood poured over each other. The slimy stickeyness sticking to both mine and his hand almost made it feel as if we were one… is this perfection?... I loved the warmth as it poured out of my shoulder. The shock on his face as I slowly pulled his blade from my shoulder and plunged it slowly through his ribs, I could tell i missed his heart, he gasped for air but no blood hit his lip. I screwed the blade deeper shoving upward making sure I hit everything I possibly could. The blood pouring from his mouth confirmed I had hit my mark. I stared into his eyes as he died, the soul leaving his body, his eyes slowly fading to grey.
……

Day 4
Holy fuck the rush was so good. The sticky thickness… As I pulled my hands from his neck, I knew where I’d placed the blade, the white blade slowly drawing from his throat. Time slowed with every millimeter drawn out

1q92bbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1q92bbj/i_procrastinated_on_everything_important_for_6/,"I procrastinated on everything important for 6 years, here’s how I finally stopped","

I’m 27. For the last 6 years of my life, I procrastinated on literally everything that mattered.

Important work project due? I’d start it the night before in a panic. Doctor’s appointment I needed to schedule? Put it off for 8 months. Bills that needed paying? Waited until I got late notices. Difficult conversations I needed to have? Avoided them until the relationship fell apart.

I wasn’t lazy in the traditional sense. I was always doing something. I just wasn’t doing the things I actually needed to do.

Instead of working on important tasks, I’d reorganize my desk. Clean my room. Research the perfect productivity system. Watch videos about how to stop procrastinating. Do busy work that felt productive but accomplished nothing.

I was a master at looking busy while avoiding anything that actually mattered.

This destroyed my life in ways I didn’t even realize until recently. Lost job opportunities because I missed deadlines. Ruined relationships because I avoided difficult conversations. Stayed unhealthy because I procrastinated on doctor visits and eating right. Stayed broke because I put off working on my career.

Every single important area of my life suffered because I couldn’t make myself do hard things until they became emergencies.

THE PROCRASTINATION LIFE

It started in college. I’d have a paper due in 3 weeks. Plenty of time. I’d tell myself I’d start early this time, really plan it out, do it right.

Day 1, I’d think about the paper but not start it. Still had 3 weeks.

Week 1, I’d do some light research. Bookmark some articles I’d definitely read later. Feel productive.

Week 2, I’d outline the paper. Feel good about making progress. Then not touch it for another week.

Night before it was due, I’d panic and write the entire thing in 6 hours fueled by energy drinks and anxiety. Turn it in at 11:58pm. Get a B minus.

Every single time. I knew exactly how much time I had before panic mode kicked in and I’d use every second of it to avoid the work.

Graduated college and the pattern continued into real life except now the stakes were higher.

Got a job in project management. Good salary, decent company. I was smart enough to do the work well. But I’d procrastinate on everything until the last possible moment.

Had a presentation due Friday? I’d start making the slides Thursday night. Had to review a document by Monday? I’d do it Monday morning. Had a difficult email to send? I’d rewrite it 30 times and still not send it.

My boss noticed. Started missing me off important projects because he couldn’t trust me to deliver on time. That hurt but not enough to change.

Got let go after a year. They said it was downsizing but I knew it was my procrastination. They kept people who delivered consistently and cut people who were unreliable.

Next job, same thing. Smart enough to get hired, too much of a procrastinator to keep the job. Lasted 8 months.

After that I did freelance work because at least I couldn’t get fired. But I’d take on projects and procrastinate until clients got pissed. Lost clients constantly. Made barely enough to survive.

My personal life was the same disaster. Needed to go to the dentist, put it off for 3 years until I had a cavity that needed a root canal. Needed to have a serious talk with my girlfriend about our relationship, avoided it for months until she broke up with me. Needed to file my taxes, waited until the last day and then filed for an extension.

Everything important got pushed to tomorrow. Tomorrow became next week. Next week became next month. Next month became never or became a crisis.

I was 27 and had accomplished almost nothing because I spent 6 years avoiding everything that actually mattered.

WHY I PROCRASTINATED ON EVERYTHING

Used to think I was just bad at time management or needed better systems. Tried every productivity app and method. GTD, Pomodoro, time blocking, bullet journaling. Nothing worked.

Finally realized procrastination wasn’t about time management. It was about emotion management.

I procrastinated on important things because they made me uncomfortable. The bigger and more important the task, the more anxiety it caused, the more I avoided it.

Work project that mattered? Scary because I might fail or it might not be good enough. So I’d avoid it and do easy tasks instead.

Difficult conversation? Scary because of potential conflict or rejection. So I’d put it off until it exploded.

Doctor appointment? Scared they’d find something wrong. So I just didn’t go.

Job applications? Scared of rejection. So I’d research and prepare forever but never actually apply.

I was avoiding discomfort. My brain learned that procrastination provided short term relief from anxiety. Do something easy and feel good now, deal with consequences later.

The problem is later always comes. And when it does, the consequences are worse and the anxiety is worse and now I’m in crisis mode.

Also I had zero accountability. No one was checking on me. No external pressure until deadlines hit. So I’d drift along procrastinating because there were no consequences until it was too late.

My dopamine system was fucked too. Between social media, video games, and YouTube, I could get instant gratification any time I wanted. Working on something hard and important for unclear future payoff couldn’t compete with the easy dopamine hit of scrolling TikTok.

I’d built a life where avoiding important things was easy and doing important things was hard.

PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS TO STOP

Tried to fix this so many times over the years.

Attempt 1, made elaborate to do lists every day. Felt productive making the lists. Never actually did the important items. Just did the easy quick tasks so I could check boxes.

Attempt 2, used the Pomodoro technique. Worked for one day. Then I’d start a Pomodoro for an important task and spend the whole 25 minutes on Twitter instead.

Attempt 3, told myself I’d do the hardest thing first every day. Did that exactly once. Every other day I’d convince myself I needed to ease into the day with easier tasks first.

Attempt 4, tried habit stacking and morning routines. Built great routines around easy things like making coffee and working out. Still procrastinated on actual important work.

Attempt 5, hired an accountability coach. Told him I’d get things done. Then lied to him about my progress because I was too embarrassed to admit I’d procrastinated again.

Nothing worked because I was treating the symptoms instead of the root cause. I wasn’t building the ability to do uncomfortable things. I was just trying different ways to trick myself into being productive.

THE ACTUAL TURNING POINT

My dad came to visit. He’s 64, retired last year from a career he actually built. We were talking and he asked what I was working on.

Gave him some vague answer about freelance projects and figuring things out.

He said, you know when I was your age I procrastinated on everything too. Cost me my first marriage and almost cost me my career. Took me years to figure out that I was just scared.

That hit different. My dad never talked about his failures. And the idea that procrastination was about fear, not laziness or bad habits, made something click.

I wasn’t procrastinating because I was lazy or disorganized. I was procrastinating because I was scared of discomfort and failure and I’d never learned how to push through those feelings.

Started researching procrastination from that angle. Found this video from a guy who’d overcome chronic procrastination by building what he called discomfort tolerance. The ability to do hard things even when every part of you wants to avoid them.

He said you can’t think your way out of procrastination. You have to train yourself to act despite discomfort. And you need external structure because your brain will always find excuses.

He mentioned using an app called Reload that forces you to complete daily tasks and blocks escape routes during work hours. It builds the discipline to do uncomfortable things through progressive difficulty.

That made sense. Every time I’d tried to stop procrastinating before, I relied on motivation or willpower. Which worked until the task made me uncomfortable, then I’d find any excuse to avoid it.

Downloaded the app and set it up. Told it my main issue was procrastinating on important tasks. My goals were to stop procrastinating, build the ability to do hard things, complete important work on time, stop avoiding uncomfortable situations.

It generated a 60 day program that started with tasks that seemed almost too easy.

Week 1, do one important task within 5 minutes of thinking about it. Work on your most important project for just 15 minutes. Send one message or email you’ve been avoiding. That’s it.

The app also blocked my usual escape apps during work hours. No Twitter, no YouTube, no Reddit, no TikTok. Couldn’t procrastinate by scrolling when I was supposed to be working.

MONTH 1, LEARNING TO START

Week 1 to 2, the 5 minute rule changed everything. I’d think about doing something important and instead of adding it to my list for later, I had to start it within 5 minutes.

Didn’t have to finish it. Just had to start. That removed the pressure that usually made me procrastinate.

Needed to send a difficult email? Had to open my email and start writing within 5 minutes. Usually by the time I started I’d just finish it because starting was the hard part.

The 15 minutes of important work thing worked because it was manageable. I could do anything for 15 minutes. Couldn’t tell myself I needed a 4 hour block of perfect focus time.

My apps being blocked during work hours eliminated my escape routes. Usually when something felt uncomfortable I’d open Twitter or YouTube without even thinking. Now I couldn’t. Had to sit with the discomfort instead of avoiding it.

Week 3 to 4, tasks ramped up slightly. Do three important tasks within 5 minutes. Work on most important project for 30 minutes. Have one uncomfortable conversation you’ve been avoiding.

That conversation one was brutal. I’d been avoiding talking to a client about late payment for 2 months. Finally sent the message. Client apologized and paid immediately. I’d built up this huge anxiety about it and it took 5 minutes to resolve.

Started noticing a pattern. The things I procrastinated on the most took way less time and were way less painful than I’d built them up to be in my head. The anticipation was worse than the actual task.

MONTH 2, BUILDING MOMENTUM

Week 5 to 6, increased to 45 minutes on important work. Five important tasks done within 5 minutes of thinking about them. Two uncomfortable tasks per week.

Was actually getting things done for the first time in years. Not perfectly, not always on time, but way more consistently than before.

Applied for three jobs I’d been putting off. Got interviews for two. That never would’ve happened if I kept procrastinating.

Scheduled the doctor appointments I’d been avoiding for over a year. Dentist, physical, everything. Turned out I was fine, I’d just been anxious for no reason.

Had difficult conversations I’d been putting off. Some went well, some didn’t, but at least they were done instead of hanging over my head.

Week 7 to 8, hit my first real test. Had a big freelance project due in two weeks. Old me would’ve procrastinated until the last 2 days and done a shit job.

The app had me work on it for 90 minutes every day starting immediately. No waiting for the perfect time or the right mood. Just show up and work.

Did it. Finished the project 3 days early. Client was shocked. I was shocked. First time in 6 years I’d finished something important early instead of in a panic at the last second.

The ranked mode in the app kept me motivated. Seeing my consistency score go up made me want to keep the streak going. Gamified following through instead of procrastinating.

MONTH 3 TO 5, ACTUALLY CHANGING

Month 3, the tasks were legitimately challenging. Work on important projects for 2 hours daily. Complete all important tasks same day you identify them. Do one thing you’ve been procrastinating on for over a month.

That last one made me face things I’d been avoiding for way too long. Taxes I hadn’t filed. Friendships I’d let die because I avoided reaching out. Career moves I’d been too scared to make.

Started filing my overdue taxes. Reached out to old friends. Applied for jobs I actually wanted instead of just taking whatever was easy.

Month 4, got offered a job at a company I actually wanted to work for. Good salary, interesting work, growth potential. The kind of opportunity I would’ve fucked up in the past by procrastinating during the interview process.

This time I prepared early. Responded to emails promptly. Did the take home assignment immediately instead of waiting until the night before. Got the offer.

Month 5, started the new job. Old me would’ve procrastinated there too and gotten let go within a year. New me was completing work ahead of schedule. My manager actually commented on how reliable I was.

That felt surreal. Reliable. Me. The guy who’d been fired from two jobs for procrastinating.

WHERE I AM NOW

It’s been 7 months since I started actually addressing my procrastination instead of just feeling bad about it.

I still procrastinate sometimes. It’s not completely gone. But instead of procrastinating on everything important for weeks or months, I might put something off for a day before I make myself do it.

Got promoted at my job last month. Three months in and I got promoted because I was consistently delivering good work on time. That never would’ve happened before.

My personal life is better too. I handle things when they come up instead of letting them build into disasters. Schedule appointments when I need them. Have difficult conversations when they’re needed. Pay bills on time. File my taxes early.

Still use Reload daily because the structure keeps me from slipping back. The app blocking during work hours keeps me from escaping into social media. The daily tasks keep me doing important things instead of just easy things.

Most importantly, I can make myself do uncomfortable things now. That’s the real change. I’m not waiting for motivation or the perfect moment. I just do the thing even when I don’t want to.

My dad visited again last week. Asked how things were going. I actually had real accomplishments to tell him about instead of vague excuses. He said he could see the difference. That meant a lot.

WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT PROCRASTINATION

Procrastination isn’t about time management or productivity systems. It’s about avoiding emotional discomfort. You procrastinate on things that make you anxious or scared or uncomfortable.

You can’t think your way out of it. You have to build the ability to act despite discomfort. That’s a skill you develop through practice, not something you fix with the right app or method.

The anticipation is always worse than the actual task. The difficult email, the uncomfortable conversation, the important project. They’re never as bad as the anxiety you build up avoiding them.

Starting is the hardest part. Once you actually start the thing you’ve been procrastinating on, momentum carries you through. It’s the gap between thinking about it and starting that kills you.

You need external structure when your internal discipline is broken. You can’t rely on willpower or motivation to overcome years of procrastination habits. You need systems that force you to follow through.

Remove your escape routes. As long as you can easily scroll social media or watch YouTube when things get uncomfortable, you’ll choose that over doing hard things. Block the exits.

Small wins build momentum. One important task done on time leads to another. One uncomfortable conversation handled well makes the next one easier. The confidence compounds.

Procrastination is usually protecting you from something. Fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of success, fear of discomfort. You have to figure out what you’re actually avoiding and face it directly.

You can’t wait until you feel like it. You’ll never feel like doing the hard uncomfortable important things. You do them anyway and the feelings follow.

IF YOU PROCRASTINATE LIKE I DID

Stop lying to yourself about why you procrastinate. It’s not because you work better under pressure or you’re waiting for the right time. You’re avoiding discomfort.

Identify the one thing you’ve been procrastinating on the longest. The thing that makes you most uncomfortable to think about. That’s what you need to do first.

Use the 5 minute rule. When you think about doing something important, start it within 5 minutes. Don’t add it to a list for later. Start now even if you don’t finish.

Block your escape apps during work hours. Remove the ability to avoid discomfort by scrolling. Make it harder to procrastinate than to just do the work.

Start with 15 minutes on the important thing. You can do anything for 15 minutes. Don’t wait for hours of perfect focus time. Just do 15 minutes now.

Build external accountability. An app, a person, a public commitment. Something outside yourself that creates pressure to follow through.

Do the uncomfortable thing first. The difficult email, the hard conversation, the scary task. Get it done early before you have time to build up anxiety about it.

Track what you complete, not what you plan to do. Your to do list doesn’t matter. What matters is what you actually finished today.

Accept that doing the thing will feel uncomfortable and do it anyway. You’re not waiting for it to feel easy. You’re building the ability to act despite discomfort.

Give yourself 60 days of actually following through before you judge if you can change. Not 3 days. Not 2 weeks. Two full months of doing hard things consistently.

I spent 6 years procrastinating on everything that mattered and it destroyed my career, my relationships, and my potential. I’m 7 months into actually doing uncomfortable things and my life is completely different.

Stop waiting for tomorrow. What’s the one important thing you’ve been procrastinating on that you could start right now?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1768046312.0,Productivitycafe,3,1.0,False

Apparently, there’s an entire ""World U"" platform gaining traction at other universities that uses this. The idea is that once you’re verified as a human, you get access to specific student rewards, gated community events, and perks that bots can’t scrape. I’ve seen some buzz about people already redeeming rewards in other tech hubs.  
  
The CS major in me thinks it’s a necessary evolution. As LLMs get better, proving you're a real student and not a script is going to be a massive issue for digital campus spaces.

I haven’t seen an Orb anywhere in the Yard or around Mass Ave yet (and knowing Harvard’s admin, they probably won't let one inside the gates for a long time). But given the density of startups in Cambridge, I wouldn't be surprised if one popped up in a nearby coffee shop or co-working space soon.

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I've been takin German classes for the past weeks and I'd say that sie sind sehr interessant.

1q92333,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q92333/helpadvicd/,Help/advicd,"I got discarded by my FA (anxious leaning) work colleague/ex after just short of four months I’m hoping to share my story, I’m really praying an FA could respond maybe share some light.

We met at a work party through a mutual friend in September, we got talking had a lot in common and that night led to me spending the night at hers. From there due to being co workers we agreed to keep things secret at work. We would sometimes sneak away for forbidden kisses in hallways when nobody was watching etc but mostly it was weekends together and we would go away on dates, she was always a busy person as she has a full time job and kids so I’d maybe get a morning text, then a few more once her kids went to bed around 7pm. She could go the entire day with no messaging. For me this was our version of “hot and cold”

About 3 weeks in she suggested we go away together on a mini cruise, things were great, ideal even. Around 4 weeks I accidentally met her kids as their dad dropped them off early. Not intentional but she did panic a little. I managed to reassure her and things were great. From that point on, I saw her maybe 3x a week, often she would invite me to have dinner with her kids, or we’d have “family days” out involving road trips. I loved these times, weirdly becoming bonded/attached the family dynamic. Little things like helping them get ready for school if I had stayed over the night before etc.

She started to express a few wobbles here and there that she wasn’t good enough, that she worried that maybe I deserved my own kids etc but I was understanding and managed to put her mind at ease every time.

8-9 weeks in roughly, after I had met her sister (and sisters husband) on a date night she messages me to say that she’s worried again - you see we both had seperate Christmas work nights out in November (same night, but different teams/parties) she initially told me she’d meet me out as her night out was just bowling, then said a few more people are going so she might not meet me, I said it’s fine either way just let me know. Send us a text on the night no pressure. But you see she felt like it was pressure for some reason, and said it made her realise about how we’ve moved quickly without what she called “a stable base” for our relationship as she attaches slowly and takes her a while to warm up but I’m very special, and she loves what I do for her and the kids etc. she asked me for a week off, to sort her head out. I agreed, telling her I understand and I’m here if she needs anything.

For this “week off” we don’t talk the Sunday, Monday she messages me asking if I’m ignoring her, I said no I’m just giving you space, Tuesday we’re talking but very shallow, casual low pressure talk “how’s work” etc, Wednesday she rings me out of the blue tells me she’s bought me lunch and to go meet her. Friday (work night out) she not only texts me to meet her, but then comes back to mine, and confesses she thinks she’s falling in love with me. I said it back and we spent the entire weekend together (so much for a week off eh?)

Things return back to “normal” shes back to inviting me over for tea with the kids and days/trips out etc, things are great.

2 weeks before Christmas we do secret Santa with our teams in the office.

One of her best friends is on my team, and she’s told my ex that I was flirting with another girl during the secret Santa event. My FA girlfriend in question at the time rang me, in tears asking what’s going on. I reassured her nothing, we were talking video games. She understands, she knows her friend is a gossip and always adds things on but I made a point (not because she asked me too) but from that point on to never be alone or go to lunch with this girl that my FA girlfriend was jealous of. Just incase.

We’re in bed the next night, she’s talking about marriage, asking about the possibility of her having my child in a year or so maybe. I’m feeling really bonded at this point.

Few days later, her secret santa present - a sex toy with a note saying “call me” from a guy on her team who had/has previously expressed interest however he has a girlfriend so she said she has/would never go there as she finds him gross. I told her that the toy is funny, the note annoyed me but it’s nothing to do with her, I’m annoyed with him. She agreed, everything is fine.

She tells me from there that she saw what I had did with the girl from my secret Santa, and she knows people talk in our office so she’s not gonna go to lunch with this guy either unless there’s a group.

Few days later she messaged me saying she can’t go to lunch with me because she’s busy but messages about 10 minutes later to say I just wanted you to hear it from me, gone to lunch with that guy - he surprised me and just tagged along. Don’t hate me. I found out later they didn’t just go for coffee but also sat alone upstairs; 

I said that’s okay thanks for telling me but it did upset me. We had a small fight about it, her telling me she’d never do anything with him. I told her I’m not jealous of him, I don’t think she would do anything like that, but you set a boundary and then you’ve sort of skirted it. She didn’t/couldn’t understand what I meant and kept thinking I was jealous.

Anyway; we patched this up, Friday was a date night but she seemed quiet, off even. I could definitely sense the shift.

Week after this, she invited me over for Christmas with the family. Slept over Christmas Eve, matching pajamas for Christmas Day, things were great Christmas Eve but in the evening in bed I could sense she was off however I gave her space to regulate, I can see why she would be maybe still upset,but also the overwhelming nature of the kids, Christmas etc. I didn’t read into it. Christmas Day is fine, we have tea, but then she goes to bed from 3-8pm saying she’s exhausted, leaving me and her kids alone. At 8pm she wakes up, we chat for an hour about surface level stuff. 9pm back in bed, no intimacy no kiss goodnight.

Boxing Day I ask if she wanted to do anything as she’s child free until new year, she said she wanted some time to chill. I said alright no worries, I’m going to visit my dad in another city. I get a kiss on the cheek and I left.

Few hours later, I get a text saying what she said before during the week off. She’s overwhelmed, can’t give me what I need, she’s now unsure of her feelings and the “vibe” has felt off since “our fight” I tried to reassure saying I understand all the stress and I’m sorry if I’ve been off etc, maybe we just need some time to think and she can chill whilst I’m away because I don’t want her to rush into anything whilst I’m away and we can talk when I get back.

She agreed; but a few hours later I get another text saying it’s the right decision for her, she wants to end it.

We had no contact since, I didn’t even reply.

Thursday just gone (8th of Jan) is the first time I’ve seen her since. We locked eyes twice and she darts away straight away. I said hey, she said hey you okay, I said fine thanks you? She said good, all of this as I walked past her. I didn’t stop to talk. I hadn’t told anyone about the break up, but I found out yesterday she had told her best mate which is understandable, I know this because her best mate tried to fish more information from me (suggesting my ex hasn’t told the full story)

Anyway, I’ll be seeing her again Monday and I’ve never felt so conflicted in my life.

On the one hand - I really did fall for her and the family dynamic, I think I found my place and sort of comfortably fell into my role, it was very disarming. Ive never felt so blindsided and I don’t know what to do. The fact she won’t meet eyes with me tells me she’s feeling something right?

On the other hand - it was so short lived, maybe I’m just fooling myself, but why would you invite me to Christmas with your family etc if you felt unsure? It’s so bizzare to me.

Can any FA’s please, I know it’s a lot but can someone explain what happened? Do I approach her and talk to her? I shouldn’t trust ChatGPT but that’s telling me that there’s only a 15% chance she’s gonna reach out and less than 5% it’s gonna end in us trying again.

Do I let go? Do I talk to her? Yesterdaybwould be the end of week 2 since break so maybe she’s still feeling huge relief? I don’t know.  ",1,1768045492.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m an introvert in my early 30s from India, and I’ve decided to take a long solo trip (1 month or more) starting from Ujjain or Surat, moving through Gujarat and then North India.

This trip is not just for travel or tourism.

My main intention is:
	•	to explore myself, break mental limitations, live more fully
	•	and deeply understand businesses on the ground — factories, local markets, traditional industries, people who actually build things

I’m seriously interested in building a D2C brand in the future — open to industries like:
	•	fashion / textiles
	•	devotional items
	•	tea / coffee / masala
	•	food-based or heritage products
	•	or anything India does exceptionally well but is still under-explored

I’m not in a rush to “start fast”. I want to learn properly, observe, talk to people, see supply chains, understand margins, and identify real gaps.

I’d really appreciate advice on:
	•	cities / regions I should spend more time in
	•	industries worth observing closely
	•	how to approach factory owners or traders as a learner
	•	mistakes to avoid while doing something like this
	•	or even stories if someone has done something similar

This is a genuine attempt to reset life direction and build something meaningful, not a motivational trip.

Thanks in advance — open to honest, practical advice 🙏",2,1768045442.0,SoloTravel_India,2,1.0,False

\-Do not feature traditionally feminine notes, like intense florals, sugary gourmands, synthetic boozy 'going-out' scents, commercial perfume aisle, sample-from-a-magazine 'perfumy' scents

\-Do not feature more masculine notes, like synthetic blue scents, peppery spice, animalic musks, harsh woods, patchouli, freshness, etc

\-Are not musky, and do not smell aldehydic, ""clean"", soapy

\-Are not very one-note fruity, citrusy, green, herby, or ""fresh""

\-Are not traditionally powdery, ambery aromatic skin-scents

\-Are not plain sweet gourmands

I want to avoid smelling classic perfumey, but I also want to avoid harsh polarizing scents that are often found in unisex perfumes. Maybe I am looking for something gender-less, but not *traditionally* unisex? I hope that makes sense. I feel that most mainstream fem fragrances smell too feminine or polished, in ways that I don't think represent me or my personal style. But I also don't want to smell masculine, because that also doesn't feel like me, and masculine scents often irritate my nose because they can be so intense. I don' want to smell youthful sweet or fruity. And I also don't want to smell like a home candle.

Notes that I tend to enjoy are: not-so-sweet gourmands (like nuts, almond, milk, coffee, rum, subtle non-synthetic vanilla), subtle woods, a bit of a spicy kick to avoid complete gourmand character (like saffron, sandalwood, smoke), subtle fruits and flowers (like plums and jasmine), if mixed nicely.  


I know this is already very specific, but I find that most scents I find that are sort of in this category, do not last very long on the skin, so I'd be interested to look into perfumes that match my criteria, but are also long-lasting.

I would also appreciate a mix of notes, and not a very one-note fragrance, if possible.

Finding winter fragrances in this range is easier than finding summer fragrances, and summers can get very hot where I live, so I would highly appreciate summer perfume recommendations!

I also hope to find something with a bit of character and perhaps more interesting notes, than a safe, home-candle-ish fragrance that normally fits my taste.

Never have been, probably never will be. My typical routine involves stumbling to the kitchen, waiting impatiently for my basic coffee maker to finish, and gulping down whatever it produces while checking my phone. Functional, joyless, purely utilitarian. Then I visited a friend who had installed a big coffee machine in their kitchen, one of those serious setups with multiple group heads and professional level everything.
Watching them make coffee was like watching a ritual. Grinding beans, tamping with precision, monitoring temperature, creating this perfect cup that looked and smelled amazing. They talked about it transforming their mornings from rushed chaos into intentional moments of calm. I wanted to dismiss it as overindulgent hobby nonsense, but the coffee was legitimately incredible, and their whole energy seemed different.
Now I am wondering if equipment actually matters or if I am just romanticizing what is essentially an expensive appliance. I have researched options from home espresso machines to commercial grade setups, even checked wholesale pricing on Alibaba to understand the market. But I cannot tell if this would genuinely improve my life or just become another unused gadget taking up counter space. Do quality coffee setups really change daily habits.

1q91w05,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NutrishapeEssentials/comments/1q91w05/healthy_vs_ultraprocessed_food_whats_the/,Healthy vs. Ultra-Processed Food: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters,"[Healthy vs Processed Foods](https://preview.redd.it/bpc2928pcicg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f2196039f349981b3b747c41f2c0f9a945e20d1)

**Healthy vs. Ultra-Processed Food: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters**

In today’s food environment, it can be confusing to understand the difference between *healthy foods* and *ultra-processed foods*—especially when convenience and taste are often prioritized over nutrition. Understanding the distinction can help you make choices that support long-term health without falling for misleading marketing or oversimplified “diet” labels.

# What Makes a Food “Healthy”?

When we talk about healthy foods, we’re usually referring to **whole or minimally processed foods**—items that are close to their natural state and rich in nutrients. These include:

* Vegetables and fruits (fresh, frozen, or unsweetened)
* Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and oats
* Beans and legumes
* Lean proteins such as fish, poultry, and eggs
* Nuts, seeds, and plain dairy products
* Unsweetened beverages like tea and coffee

These foods are typically *nutrient-dense*, meaning they deliver a high amount of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other beneficial compounds per calorie. They provide your body with fuel and nourishment without unnecessary additives or excess calories.

Importantly, the term *healthy* is sometimes misleading. A better term is **nutrient-dense**—foods that provide substantial nutrition relative to their energy content. For example, a bowl of steel-cut oats with fresh berries offers more nutritional value than a bowl of sweetened cereal with the same calorie count.

# What Are Ultra-Processed Foods?

By contrast, **ultra-processed foods (UPFs)** are products that have undergone extensive industrial processing and contain many ingredients not typically used in home cooking. These items often include:

* Artificial colors and flavors
* Preservatives
* Emulsifiers and thickeners
* Added sugars, refined starches, and unhealthy fats

Examples of ultra-processed foods include sugary drinks, packaged snacks, ready-to-eat frozen meals, candies, fast foods, and many breakfast cereals with added sugar. What sets these foods apart is not just the processing itself, but the purpose behind it: *maximizing shelf life, taste, and convenience, often at the expense of nutrient density*

# A Practical Framework: The NOVA Classification

Researchers use a system called **NOVA** to categorize foods by the extent of processing:

1. **Unprocessed or minimally processed foods** — Whole fruits, vegetables, eggs, plain milk
2. **Processed culinary ingredients** — Olive oil, salt, maple syrup
3. **Processed foods** — Foods with added salt, sugar, or oil (e.g., homemade canned vegetables)
4. **Ultra-processed foods** — Factory-made products with many additives and few whole ingredients

This classification helps clarify that not all processing makes a food unhealthy—boiling, fermenting, freezing, or pasteurizing can preserve nutrients and make foods safe. But the step from *processed* to *ultra-processed* adds layers of ingredients designed for texture, taste, and profit rather than nutrition.

# Nutritional and Health Differences

The most important differences between healthy whole foods and many ultra-processed foods include:

**Calories and satiety:**  
Ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in calories but lower in fiber and protein, which means they are less filling and easier to overconsume. In contrast, whole foods help keep you satisfied longer

**Sugar, salt, and fat content:**  
Many ultra-processed products are high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats, which are linked to weight gain, metabolic issues, and chronic disease risk

**Additives and nutrient quality:**  
Ingredients like artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives may contribute to inflammation, disrupt the gut microbiome, or encourage overeating. Whole foods, on the other hand, retain their natural nutrients, even when gently processed for safety (e.g., flash-frozen vegetables)

# Can Ultra-Processed Foods Ever Fit Into a Healthy Diet?

Not all ultra-processed foods are equally unhealthy. Some products—like fortified whole grain breads, low-sugar cereals, or certain plant-based milks—can provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals and may fit into a balanced diet, especially when choice and context matter.

The key is to **read ingredient labels and nutritional information**. A shorter ingredient list with recognizably whole food items is often a better choice than long lists of additives and industrial compounds.

# Practical Tips to Choose Better

To prioritize nutrient-dense foods and minimize the downsides of ultra-processed foods:

* Base most meals around unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods
* Choose frozen or canned produce without added sugars or salt
* Opt for whole grains instead of refined versions
* Use ultra-processed items sparingly as time-saving options, not dietary staples

This balanced approach helps you enjoy convenience without sacrificing nutrition, allowing more mindful decisions that support health long-term.

# Food for Thought

The difference between *healthy* and *ultra-processed* foods lies not just in how foods are made, but in their nutritional value and role in your diet. Prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense foods while understanding how processing influences calories, additives, and satiety can empower you to make better choices for long-term health

I cup my roasts using the same cupping method to eliminate variables to assess different profiles.  Recently I was gifted a GO and am so very pleased with the brew results. What I was curious about was - *Is this truly a better result than other brew methods*? - so I tested it.  

Using the beans from the same roast (Sumatra roasted to 30sec into 2C for a City Plus+), I manually ground and brewed equal amounts using a French Press, Pour Over, Single Serve Drip coffee maker and the new Aeropress to simultaneously cup them.  The result was clear - the Aeropress GO produced stronger hazelnut and chocolate flavour with no discernible bitterness at all.  While the other brew methods all had diminished flavour notes with varying levels of bitterness?  So my question - what is the science that explains the far better extraction and smooth flavour profile produced by the GO?  I figure this forum can help me understand why this is much better and different than other brew methods.

I don't need latte art quality foam but sometimes that still feels good in a latte

Whenever I try to to use the handfrother it just makes some foam at the top and when I try to incorporate it, the foam just disappears

So is my technique an issue , or is it due to my cheap handfrother or it is impossible to get good foam from boiled milk?

She had no one else there to help her so after I chatted to my friends I helped her bag for an hour until closing and we talked a lot. I was instantly taken by her, she's beautiful, smart, and just amazing. I kept going in to see ""friends"" but I really just wanted to talk to her more. After a while I got the courage to ask her out and she said yes.

The dates we went on were great! We got coffee and ate at IHOP the first date, then we watched movies on the second date, then the third we went out to eat and came back to my house to color together. At the end of that date I kissed her at her doorstep and we texted the next few days where everything seemed normal.

A few days later I asked her if we were still good for a date that day and she said she may be busy but sheigut be able to. She has a very busy schedule so any time with her was great to me, I didn't think much of this. But she never got back to me that day. The next day she said she got busy and that she was sorry but she's going to be busy the next few days. When I would text her she would hardly respond when before she responded all the time. I thought maybe I should give it some time and see if she would text me.

About 2-3 weeks later I decided to text her and just ask straight up if she was doing ok and if she wanted to see me anymore. She said that she is not in the right space to meet anyone right now and she was being really down on herself. I told her it was ok and that I would be ok to stay friends and just talk and she just said to me thanks for being so sweet and understanding.

It's been about a month and I still think about her every day, I dream of her every night. I feel like all the sudden something just switched and I wish I could go back to before because I feel like I was maybe a little bland or awkward and I really hope that isn't what made her want to ditch me. I don't know whether I can talk to her anymore or if I should just leave her alone but I really don't want to. Even if she does just want to be friends I would happily do that, I just miss talking to her. Can I reach out and ask how she is and stuff like that or if you were her would you be annoyed? I don't want her to dislike me, but I really miss her. I feel like I can't even go to the store anymore because I don't want her to feel awkward with me being there especially because she can't leave or get away if I go and I'd hate to make her feel trapped. The only reason I feel like things might not be completely over is because I know she is going through some big personal stuff that I won't share, but I feel like that could just be overwhelming her to the point where she just doesn't want the stress of a potential relationship. Maybe all that is just copium though, and she might just not like me anymore. I'm completely lost and I have no direction anymore, what should I do?",2,1768043881.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
I’m currently looking for a roommate in Addis Ababa because rental prices have gotten really steep lately — and living alone is getting harder to manage on my own. I figured this would be a good place to try and find someone who’s also dealing with the same struggles.
About Me:
• Ethiopian (based in Addis)
• Working as a part-timer 
• Friendly, clean, pays rent on time
• Prefer respectful and easy-going housemates
Why I’m Looking for a Roommate:
Rent and living expenses in Addis have increased significantly over the last few years, especially in central or well-connected neighborhoods like Bole, Kazanchis, Meskel Flower, Mexico, and around Sidist Kilo. Even smaller apartments or rooms can be costly for one person when factoring utilities and internet. Splitting costs makes it more manageable and opens up gentler commute options.
What I’m Looking For:
• Location: Prefer central or accessible areas (Bole, Kazanchis, Mexico, Megenagna, around CMC, or near public transport routes)
• Preferences: Clean, respectful, responsible, non-smoker (optional)
Extras That Are a Plus:
✔ English/Amharic communication
✔ Works or studies full time
✔ Doesn’t mind occasional guests (within reason)
✔ Likes stability, bills paid on time :)
About the Place (if already found or type you want):
If you’re interested, please drop a comment or DM with a little info about yourself — your budget, preferred areas, move-in timeline, and what you’re looking for in a roommate. Happy to meet up for coffee and chat if we seem like a good fit.
Thanks in advance, and feel free to share any leads too!

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the kicker: **you might already have more than you realize**—you’re just not putting it to work the right way.

Most of us leave money sitting in savings accounts earning *peanuts* (like, literal pocket change) when it could be growing into something way bigger. Imagine if your coffee fund could one day pay for your *entire* coffee habit in retirement. That’s the power of making your money work for you.

### **Where’s Your Money Hiding?**
- **The ""Just in Case"" Stash** – That emergency fund? Smart. But if it’s just sitting there, inflation’s eating it alive.
- **The ""I’ll Deal With It Later"" 401(k)** – You’re contributing, but are you *maximizing* it? A few tweaks could mean thousands more down the line.
- **The ""I Don’t Trust the Market"" Cash Pile** – Playing it *too* safe might be costing you more than you think.

### **The Simple Fix?**
You don’t need to be a Wall Street genius—just a little more intentional. **Small moves now = big wins later.** Like:
✅ **Automating investments** (set it and forget it, baby).
✅ **Ditching low-interest savings** for accounts that actually grow.
✅ **Checking in on your retirement plan** (yes, even if it’s boring).

**Here’s the thing:** You’re probably closer to financial freedom than you think. The real question is—*what’s stopping you from taking the next step?*

1q91jwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q91jwq,"The Adventures of the Mud Queen – Episode 15: “The Dream, the Splash, and the Almost-Superpower”","By now, the internet had accepted one simple truth:

Lila Bellyton was not going away.

The pose still lived everywhere—arms up, tongue out, fearless and ridiculous. People mimicked it in snowstorms, grocery aisles, wedding receptions, and one extremely confusing yoga class. Ivan from Russia had escalated his devotion, posting daily updates involving spoons, forks, keys, and once, briefly, a refrigerator magnet shaped like a cat.

Lila watched it all with fond amusement.

“I think I accidentally unlocked a side quest,” she told Mia one evening.

The Dream

That night, Lila dreamed.

In the dream, she stood on a rooftop, the city glowing behind her. She wore a bright red superhero suit, mask perfectly fitted, cape snapping dramatically in the wind. Below, burglars froze mid-step, their loot trembling in their hands.

She raised her arms.

Struck the pose.

The burglars screamed.

Metal flew.

Guns, knives, coins, belt buckles—everything leapt toward her with impossible force, clinging to her midsection like obedient pigeons. Sirens wailed. Applause erupted. Someone shouted, “IT’S THE MUD QUEEN!”

Lila smiled, heroic and calm.

“Sometimes,” Dream-Lila declared,
“the messiest moments save the day.”

She woke up grinning.

Reality, Unfortunately

Morning light filtered through the curtains. No cape. No mask. No spoons hovering respectfully nearby.

She sighed, stretching.

“Shame,” she muttered. “I could’ve used that.”

Her phone buzzed immediately.

Mia: Shopping today.
Sophie: We need new jackets.
Tina: I am bored and require chaos.

Lila laughed and rolled out of bed.

A Normal, Perfectly Safe Day

The day passed easily—coffee, browsing, trying on clothes that Tina declared “emotionally confusing.” Lila behaved herself. No spills. No incidents. No poses.

By evening, rain had started to fall, turning the streets shiny and reflective. The city smelled clean and cold.

Lila waved goodbye to her friends and started walking home alone, hands in her pockets, humming softly.

Everything was normal.

Which, in hindsight, was suspicious.

The Splash

The sound came first.

A motorbike.

Too fast.

Too close.

Lila barely had time to turn before the bike hit a puddle with absolute enthusiasm.

SHHHHPLASH.

Mud and water surged up in a glorious arc, colliding with her midsection like it had been waiting all day for this moment.

She gasped, stumbling back.

Her white pants were ruined. Her top soaked. Mud dripped slowly, unapologetically.

She looked down.

Then up.

Then sighed.

“…Of course.”

The Almost-Superpower

As Lila stood there, dripping and stunned, shouting broke the air behind her.

“HEY!”

Two figures ran past her—masked, frantic, clutching a bag. A shop alarm blared. Somewhere, glass shattered.

Burglars.

Lila froze.

Her dream flickered through her mind.

The rooftop.
The pose.
The power.

She glanced down at herself—muddy, soaked, very much not magnetic.

But she stepped forward anyway. 

“HEY!” she shouted, louder than she expected.

The burglars turned.

Lila raised her arms.

Struck the pose.

Tongue out. Zero dignity. Full commitment.

They stopped.

Stared.

One whispered, “Is that… her?”

Pedestrians stared. Phones appeared instantly.

Lila didn’t move.

“You really want this on the internet?” she said calmly.

The burglars exchanged a look.

Then dropped the bag and ran.

Aftermath

Sirens arrived. Applause followed—awkward, surprised, genuine. Someone yelled, “DO IT AGAIN!” Another shouted, “THE MUD QUEEN SAVES THE STREET!”

Lila laughed, mud still dripping, heart racing.

When Mia, Sophie, and Tina arrived breathless minutes later, they found her standing under a streetlight, muddy and smiling.

Sophie blinked. “Did you… stop burglars?”

“Technically,” Lila said, “I scared them with confidence and poor timing.”

Tina nodded solemnly. “That counts.”

Later that night, the video went viral.

Again.

Ivan commented within seconds:

“No magnet. Still unstoppable.” 🥄

Lila watched the rain wash some of the mud away and smiled softly.

No superpowers.
No cape.
Just herself.

And sometimes, that was more than enough.

When I first started going, I could do a full week there for around £800. By 2020, that had risen to around £1,400 to £1,500 a week. When you actually work it out, nearly doubling in price over twenty years isn’t unreasonable. That felt like normal inflation. It tracked with wages. It still felt fair.

What’s happened since is different.

Post-Covid, that same week now costs me well over £3,000 all in. Doing the same thing across a year now comes out at over £9,000, compared to around £5,000 just before Covid. Same trips. Same hotels. Same habits. Almost double the cost again, but this time over a five-year period. That’s the part I can’t keep up with.

And before anyone says it can be done cheaper, of course it can. It always could. This isn’t about budget travel or cutting corners. It’s about repeating the same trips I’ve been taking for decades and suddenly finding that the numbers no longer make sense.

But what’s interesting is that my a big reason for me going to Amsterdam is the coffeeshops and they aren’t even the main issue. Prices have gone up, but you can still find good weed for under €14 a gram if you know where to look. That’s expensive, but acceptable, because you’rea tourist paying for the space, the ability to sit, relax, and enjoy the city. That part of Amsterdam still works.

The problem is everything else around it.

Hotels have gone completely off the rails. One hotel I’ve stayed in many times has gone up around eighty percent compared to what I was paying pre-Covid. Same room, same location, no meaningful upgrades. Food has followed the same pattern. Amsterdam was never cheap to eat in, but now even casual meals feel overpriced. Then there’s the day-to-day spending. Drinks, coffees, snacks, all the little things that used to blend into the background now stand out.

The result is that you spend your time doing mental maths instead of actually enjoying the city. And once that starts happening, the experience has already changed.

This is why Amsterdam now feels better suited to first-time visitors than repeat ones. If you’re coming once, you’ll tolerate the prices. If you’ve been coming back for years, you feel the shift immediately.

I still love Amsterdam. That hasn’t changed. But I’ll keep it real, I can’t keep up with this pace of price increases. When a city doubles in cost over twenty years, that’s one thing. When it does it again in five, something breaks.

Amsterdam hasn’t become bad. It’s just become too expensive for the kind of long-term relationship that made me fall in love with it.",6,1768043562.0,Amsterdam,8,0.69,False
1q91jma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q91jma/is_he_dangerous/,Is he dangerous?,"I f40 met a man m46 almost two weeks ago on tinder.

He is working for a large automotive manufacturer and hast been for 25 years here in Germany and he has also been a firefighter for over a decade as his hobby.

He seemed more trustworthy than the average match and initially did everything right.

He has been separated from his wife of approx. two decades, who has moved out from the house they built together into a small apartment in a village 5 miles away, for almost a year. He seemed genuinely into me and like a decent guy, which is why I let go of my ususal principle in this case which is not to date married men.

His two sons, 18 and 20, both work full-time as IT staff and still live in the family home with him and they see their mum regularly. She sometomes comes to the house pick them up to go to the gym or shopping together and he is still on speaking terms with her. He says the marriage was destroyed for years and she has warned him that she wants to do her own thing and that he has to stay out of her business. He also alluded to her having had a new bf recently.
They live in the Village where her family is from, he is originally from 20 miles away.

When asked he said the marriage failed because he travelled globally for work 100 days a year while the wife was left alone with everything, now narrowed down to 20.

First date was five hours with walks and going for a coffee, it was great, he did try to hug a lot though.

We did message a lot. He said he had told his younger son about meeting me and that he likes me very much and he had said: you need to be happy, dad so she can come visit as long as she doesn't tell me when to brush my teeth etc. He then asked what my 6yo had said about him?

I said how this was way too early and that I had once made the mistake to introduce my ex to my now 6yo early after two months and how my kid still misses him and that I will  wait approx. 6 months. He said he fully understood cause of the very different age compared to his kids and he had genuinely accepted this I think.

Second date he wanted to show the lake near their village where he goes for walks. I took a train and before we then walked around the lake he showed me around all of the village. When I arrived at the platform he not only hugged me but tried to pick me up, spin me around which failed. There was no coffee shop or anywhere to go after walking around the lake and it was -5 degrees. He invited me to his home. I reluctantly agreed, asked to take things slowly, he agreed. Several times I asked what if your boys come home. He kept dismissing this and we had met for a morning walk and they were to return at night.

The reason I agreed to go to his house is he was really into me, as opposed to my past encounters with highly emotionally unavailable, unsure about me men not wanting to commit, hiding me.

We had a chat on his couch. I then felt like snuggling up to him, which I invited him to do. He put his hand under my shirt up to my bra lock when I stopped him there. He tried kissing me and I kept looking away, would stroke my hair but while we are of similar height and weight and he was more next to me than in top of me, I felt his weight intensely trying to hold me down. He definitely wanted sex on the couch but stopped after I called him out on the bra.

Then his sons and wife came in around noon. He talked to them, saying that because he enjoys spending time with me so much he completely forgot that the funeral of the wife's distant relative is in 30 minutes. He forgot despite my questions? He even had ""9-12: meet *User*"" pop up in his car's calendar.

I said I need to leave now and the family went hiding upstairs which is when he started kissing me and insisting he is allowed to do this. He offered to drive me back to my hometown, I said you will miss the funeral, just take me to the train station quickly and attend the funeral.

I was at the train station for almost an hour before the train arrived in the cold but I had Just wanted to leave the situation. In the car he suddenly said he had already talked to all three of them about me which must have been a lie, asked when do I see you again and kissed me trying to put his tongue in my mouth. An hour later after I do not immediately answer the Phone he messages: stupid situation, are you OK? I spoke to my family so over here things are OK. 

Later: I would appreciate if you gave me a call later.

He asked to call, I declined, messaging I felt unsafe with him today and I do not wish to get to know him. He kept saying how stupid he was, how great of a chance I was that he messed up, he genuinely apologises that he had no idea this has hurt me as much as it did. I said it was highly unnecessary, hurtful for all parties involved, entirely preventable and how should his sons accept me in future after this. He became defensive, confirmed the wife is indeed moved out, his sons will always remain his sons.

After more of his self-depreciation I said we are going in circles and stopped replying, have not heard from him in three days.

Is he potentially dangerous or a stalker or just inexperienced and going through a rough patch in life?

Most people aren't broke because they don't make enough. They're broke because they don’t know where their money is actually going. Spending habits feel harmless until one day rent's due and it’s panic mode again. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. This post breaks down why most people struggle with money and the 5 rules that’ll actually change things for real this time. Sourced from top experts, best-selling books, and the most practical financial philosophies out there.

Not everyone needs to be rich. But everyone needs to stop being broke.

Here’s what works.

1. Track every dollar (yes, all of it)  

If you don’t know where your money is going, you’ve already lost. Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You to Be Rich, calls this “conscious spending.” It’s not just about budgeting—it’s about being intentional. Apps like YNAB and Mint aren't magic, but they help you see the invisible money leaks that quietly drain your bank account. The CFPB reports that nearly 40% of people underestimate how much they spend monthly. That gap is where your freedom goes.

2. Stop trying to eliminate lattes—fix the big three instead  

Housing, transportation, and food. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these three eat up over 60% of the average American’s income. Cutting $5 coffees won’t matter if you’re overpaying on rent or financing a car you can’t afford. Focus on downsizing rent, cooking at home, or using public transit where possible. Want to build financial breathing room? Start here.

3. Make saving automatic so it’s not tied to your willpower  

James Clear (Atomic Habits) emphasizes designing your environment to win. Automate transfers to savings or investment accounts the day your paycheck hits. Behavioral research from the Brookings Institution shows that defaults matter more than intention—automatic systems work because they remove emotion and choice from the equation.

4. Learn to delay dopamine  

Impulse purchases don’t seem like a big deal until they pile up. Researchers at Stanford found that people who delay gratification tend to have better life outcomes across the board. One trick: use a 48-hour rule before non-essential spending. Put it in your cart, wait two days, then ask yourself if you still want it. Most of the time, you won’t.

5. Build a “no shame” emergency fund  

The Federal Reserve says over 30% of Americans can’t cover a $400 emergency. That’s not a math problem. That’s a stability problem. Start with just $500. Put it in a separate savings account. It’s not for fun. It’s for “life hits you out of nowhere and you don’t want to panic” situations. This one move makes you feel 10x more in control.

Don’t wait till you make more money. Get good with the money you already have.",1,1768043433.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

Kane hit the lobby at 07:42. The tiles were shiny but scratched. Fluorescent lights buzzed. It smelled like bleach.

His shoes squeaked past the reception desk. The “Legacy Advisor” badge clinked against his button. The Termination Schedule was waiting.

Slide decks slid. The project manager tapped a pointer at a screen showing a world map. Kane raised his hand. “No,” he said.

The room went quiet. A pen rolled from a junior analyst’s fingers. She caught it, knuckles white. A manager pressed his lips together and nodded. Papers shuffled. They started deleting things.

By 10:15, a memo slid across the table. The header read: Termination Schedule – Endorsed. Kane scanned the list. Nothing matched the list he had memorized. He set it down.

An elbow bumped it. The memo hit the floor and stayed there. No one touched it.

Lunch was plastic trays. Soup sloshed. Someone’s chair scraped too close. Kane moved back. The thermostat clicked. Afternoon was a stack of files. Someone held up a sticky note: Extinction alignment confirmed. Kane reached for it. The paper tore in his hand.

At home, the apartment smelled of carpet and old coffee. He switched on a lamp. Shadows hung in the corners. The ficus leaned toward the light, dropping three dry leaves. He pulled a chair to the desk. The notebook snapped open.

He wrote: Tomorrow, I will try again. A droplet of water fell from the window onto the ink. It ran down slowly.

Kane stared. Something was already here. ",1,1768043393.0,stories,0,1.0,False

* 09 Jan 2026 – Received message that passport was dispatched
* 10 Jan 2026 – Received passport with Germany student visa stamped

A small suggestion for everyone applying:

For students going to VFS Mumbai for a Germany student visa, here are a few important points from my experience:

For visa fee payment, carry a debit or credit card or cash. Do not rely on UPI, as UPI payments are not accepted at VFS Mumbai.

During the appointment, they do not take or verify original documents. They don’t even check the originals. All documents are printed by VFS staff directly from what you uploaded in the CSP portal. Still, it’s always good to carry your original documents as backup, even though they may not be asked for.

If you have opted for the premium lounge, don’t forget to enjoy the cookies, coffee and snacks.

If your university is a public university, there is usually no interview in most cases. Only very basic questions are asked, such as:

* expected travel date
* whether your course is in English or German
* your home address
* your name and phone number

Be present on time or at least 15 minutes early. Even in the premium lounge, there can be waiting depending on the number of appointments. In my case, I waited around 2 hours due to Monday rush. One of my friends attended on a Friday and finished everything in about 30 minutes, so waiting time can vary. Don’t worry about it.

Overall, the process is simple. You mainly need to provide basic details and biometric data, and that’s it.",2,1768042915.0,studying_in_germany,7,0.67,False

I was working on converting blogs from my Appalachian friend’s time in the military. They were originally printed in physical form. I began a personal project of scanning and digitizing them for preservation. I would do editing between my PC and my smartphone.

Now I can’t seem to find the most recent copy on my phone, which means I lost progress and have to pick up where I left off on the PC copy.

I knew better and should have been more careful.

Moving forward, I’ll have a backup cloud copy so it’s always the most recent version when I’m editing and saving my progress. I should have done that from the beginning.

1q915n7,https://i.redd.it/kv19cwy35icg1.jpeg,Death Was the Only Thing That Chose Me (free link pls!),"Chapter 1

I was born the day my mother died.

And my brother decided I would pay for it forever.

He called me his sister.

But he treated her like one.

The cousin who lived in our house.

The girl he protected, trusted, and loved.

The one whose tears mattered.

She lied about me.

I explained.

He told me to stop pretending.

She stole what should've been mine—

my position, my future, my place.

And he handed it to her himself.

On my birthday—our mother's memorial day—

I was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Two years, if I fought.

I chose not to.

So when I stood on the rooftop

and he finally cried, finally begged—

I smiled.

Because after a lifetime of being abandoned,

death was the only thing

that didn't choose her over me.

And for the first time,

I wanted to know—

Was he finally happy now?

\--

My mom died giving birth to me, and my brother, Marco Arden, had hated me for 20 years.

When I was 18, I was assaulted. He laughed and said, ""It'd be better if you just died.""

On my 24th birthday, I climbed to the rooftop. That time, he broke down in tears, begging me, ""I was wrong. I'm so sorry—""

The wind howled past my ears. I just looked at him, a smile curling on my lips. ""I'm about to die. Are you happy now, Marc?""

\*\*\*

Marco called right as I walked in the door.

The diagnosis in my bag was already crumpled into a ball.

He'd never called me first before.

""It was Dad's birthday two days ago.""

His voice was cold, sharp as ice. It always was.

""Why didn't you come home...""

""Because I didn't want to,"" I cut him off. ""You went back, didn't you?""

""Tammy flew in from overseas.""

Tamara Elmore was my uncle's daughter. She'd lived with us since we were kids.

""That was great. You only ever treat her like a sister anyway.""

Something seemed to snap in him. His voice tightened with anger as he muttered my name, ""Briana Arden!""

I pressed the hang-up button.

The last bit of evening light spilled into the room.

I sat at the desk and tore the diagnosis into shreds.

The scraps of paper fluttered down, covering the table, when suddenly my phone lit up.

Marco texted, ""Mom's memorial is coming up.""

Marco was my older brother.

He'd always hated me.

Because I was the reason he lost his mom.

More than 20 years ago, Mom died in childbirth. The moment I came into the world, she left it on the operating table.

It was a murder disguised as a birth.

No one celebrated my arrival.

Because of me, Dad lost the woman he loved most.

And Marco lost his mother.

This endless grudge began the day I was born and had lasted ever since.

I didn't skip Dad's birthday on purpose.

It was just that, on that day, the pain in my stomach was so intense I nearly passed out. That was when I realized something was wrong.

But honestly, maybe my absence made things easier for him.

Marco didn't reach out to me again.

Standing outside the office building, I took a deep breath.

After graduation, I joined his company.

I worked my way up from the very bottom, step by step, and yet no one ever realized we were related.

I actually saw him less often than the average employee did.

Last week, an executive resigned, and on Monday, they were set to announce the successor.

Everyone said the position was as good as mine.

At least, that was what I believed—until I got the diagnosis.

I ran into a coworker in the hallway. She waved, then came closer with a bright grin. ""Bria, don't forget to treat us to a big dinner when you get promoted!""

I lowered my eyes and smiled. ""It's not a sure thing yet.""

""It has to be you,"" she said, looping her arm through mine. ""Out of everyone here, you're the best.""

When I walked into the conference room, Marco was already there. Our eyes met for just a brief moment, then he looked away, as if I were a stranger.

""Good morning, Mr. Arden.""

He didn't look at me, just nodded.

So indifferent, it was as if that argument the other night had never happened.

People trickled into the room, filling the seats.

Marco cleared his throat, and my coworker shot me a knowing look.

I dropped my gaze, avoiding her eyes.

The next second, I heard a familiar name.

""Tamara Elmore.""

Tamara stepped in from the hallway, slender and graceful, her smile as gentle as ever.

Marco stood beside her, introducing her to everyone. ""Ms. Elmore just returned from overseas and will be stepping into the role of deputy manager.""

Some people instinctively glanced at me. I looked away, focusing on Tamara's radiant smile at the front of the room. For a moment, it felt like the air itself had frozen.

The simmering tensions filled the room.

I smiled and applauded.

The scattered clapping broke the strange tension in the conference room.

Tamara met my eyes, her gaze warm and soft.

The scent of coffee in the break room was so strong it felt like it might spill over. I stirred my cup with a spoon, took a sip, and swallowed, the bitterness rising in my throat.

My coworker stared wide-eyed, indignant on my behalf.

""How is this fair? She just swoops in and snatches your spot. Doesn't even try to hide the fact she's got an inside connection.

""Bria, aren't you angry?

""That job was supposed to be yours. You work so hard—last time you nearly ended up in the hospital from all that overtime.""

Her eyes lingered on the dark circles under mine. ""Bria, I'm just saying, you don't have to push yourself so hard. Cut back on the coffee.""

The warmth of the coffee seeped through the ceramic, heating my hand. I murmured, ""Mr. Arden must have his reasons.""

Chapter 2

She widened her eyes, about to whisper some complaint, but her phone rang, shrill and sudden.

Marco's voice cut through the cramped break room, tense and barely restrained, ""Briana, come to my office.""

My grip slipped, and a few drops of coffee splattered onto my white blouse, the heat burning through the fabric against my skin.

I answered quietly, ""Okay.""

The moment Marco's office door swung open, I saw Tamara sitting on the couch, her head bowed slightly.

She was clutching a piece of paper in her hand.

Marco sat nearby, his face cold, anger barely contained.

People used to say that even though Marco and I came from the same womb, the only thing we shared was our eyes.

The corners of our eyes tilt upward—when we're not smiling, there's a natural chill that keeps everyone at arm's length.

Too bad neither of us likes to smile.

And Marco has never once smiled at me.

""Tammy may have parachuted in, but she has the ability to handle the job.

""Briana.""

Marco called my name, his brow furrowing.

""If you have complaints, say them to my face. Whispering behind people's backs, teaming up with coworkers to isolate Tammy—Briana, is malice carved into your bones?""

It had only been half a day.

I glanced sideways at Tamara. She happened to look up, our eyes meeting.

Her face still had the fullness of youth, her eyes rimmed red, tears catching the light.

She quickly lowered her gaze.

The cast of this little drama was all in place, just waiting for me to play my part. But I had no interest in acting along.

""People can say whatever they want. What does it have to do with me?

""And besides, everyone here isn't stupid.""

A sob and the sound of something hitting the floor broke out together. The expensive pen that had been on the desk was now shattered into pieces.

Black ink spread out by my feet.

""Briana! You—""

A single sheet of paper drifted down onto his desk.

Marco's words caught in his throat. When he saw what was written, his anger flared up again. ""Briana!""

""Are you a child?

""Are you throwing a tantrum?""

My brand-new resignation letter was crushed into a ball and tossed back at my feet like garbage.

But it wasn't a tantrum.

I'd known for a long time.

I didn't have the right to throw a tantrum.

Only children who were loved had that right.

And I never did.

""I'll talk to HR myself.""

As I closed the door, his shouting was left behind with him inside.

I hadn't gone far before Tamara caught up to me.

""Bria."" Her voice was still a little thick from crying, and she reached out carefully to take my hand.

""Bria, please don't be upset. I don't want this job. I'll talk to Marc—I don't want you to be mad.

""I shouldn't have come back. Bria, don't let me ruin things between you and Marc.""

The hallway was empty.

I stopped and looked at her.

Tamara's eyes always carried a natural innocence, a look that made people want to protect her. Paired with her slightly red eyes and nose, she could win anyone's sympathy without even trying.

She looked just like she did ten years ago, right after she first moved in with us.

""Tamara.""

I stepped closer, pinching her chin. ""This act—never fails, does it?

""Does it?""

Tamara's face went pale in an instant.

The elevator chimed.

I let go, turned, and walked inside. She seemed stunned, still standing there.

I smiled at her. ""You know perfectly well, there's never been any real sibling bond between me and him.

""If anything, you're more like his sister than I ever was.""

As the elevator doors slid shut, I caught a glimpse of my own reflection—expressionless, blank.

A sharp pain twisted through my abdomen.

Honestly, things between Marco and me hadn't always been this bad.

When we were kids, even though he didn't like me, he never did anything truly cruel or said anything out of line.

Compared to Dad, who treated me like I was invisible, Marco, as my brother, was the only person I felt close to.

Back then, I thought, even if Marco didn't care for me, we were still family. Blood ties are supposed to mean something.

That was true—until Tamara moved in when I was in middle school.

It was when I realized Marco was capable of being good to someone.

He didn't always wear that icy mask around her. He never told her to ""get lost,"" never hit her with sarcasm or cold remarks.

That was how a brother was supposed to treat his sister.

But Tamara wasn't satisfied.

Five days after she transferred to my school, I came home one afternoon, and Marco slapped me, hard.

I stared at him, stunned, clutching my face. He muttered things I couldn't quite make out.

Instigator.

Bad seed.

Malicious.

Apologize.

But when I saw Tamara standing behind him, head down, clutching the hem of his shirt for comfort, those scattered words suddenly pieced together in my mind, forming a complete, painful lie.

Chapter 3

I tried to defend myself, but he didn't believe me.

The fight that broke out that day—and his obvious favoritism—shattered the naïve, foolish hope I'd always held onto.

Marco wasn't some idiot who couldn't tell right from wrong.

He was doing it on purpose.

It was only after that day that I finally understood my brother truly, deeply hated me.

Our relationship deteriorated fast after that.

But I was stubborn and childish, thinking that instead of letting him treat me like a stranger, the way Dad did, it was better to fight him head-on.

At least then, Marco would actually see me.

Our constant battles lasted until I turned 18.

At 18, I was dragged into hell.

After that, Marco and I became strangers overnight.

Like a war that ended without warning.

No more fights, no more screaming, no more confrontation.

Just cold indifference, as if we'd never known each other at all.

By the time I finished the paperwork and made it home, the sky outside was pitch black.

The streetlights in the neighborhood hadn't come on yet; all I could see were the warm, yellow lights glowing from distant windows across the street.

The pain in my stomach had been gnawing at me since the afternoon and hadn't let up.

Curled up on the couch, hunger and agony crawled over my body. I forced myself to stand and open the refrigerator.

A wave of nauseating rot hit me. That's when I realized—I hadn't opened the fridge in over a month.

I grabbed a handful of wilted greens, rinsed them off quickly, and set them on the cutting board. The sound of the knife hitting the wood was uneven and shaky.

Bright red blood dripped onto the emerald leaves, blooming into a raw, metallic flower.

I froze.

The pain radiated from the fresh wound, and only then did I realize I'd sliced my hand.

When the urge surged up, I couldn't stop myself.

Old scars crisscrossed with new ones—another mark added to the collection, trailing from my arm down to my wrist.

The knife clattered to the floor as I sank to my knees, gasping for air.

It felt like I was losing control more and more, drawn to hurting myself.

The doctor used to say, ""When the symptoms flare up, you must take your medication.""

But I hadn't.

She also told me to spend more time with my family.

""Briana, talk to your loved ones, let yourself feel loved.

""It'll help with your recovery.""

But...

I stared at the winding trail of blood.

But I don't have any family.

I didn't touch the food I cooked last night. It all ended up in the trash.

Hunger and pain twisted together, finally knocking me out cold on the bed.

Early in the morning, someone knocked at the door.

Half-asleep, I stumbled off the couch and shuffled over. I cracked the door open, and when I saw who was outside, every trace of drowsiness vanished.

Marco stood there, his expression frosty as ever, eyes unreadable.

Instinctively, I slammed the door shut, the metal-on-metal clang echoing between us, a barrier as solid as steel.

I hurried back to my room, threw on a jacket, and changed into a pair of long pants.

When I opened the door again, Marco's gaze landed on my face, cold enough to sting.

""What do you want?""

I skipped the pleasantries.

His eyes dropped to my wrist, where a small, colorful tattoo peeked out from beneath my sleeve.

Marco narrowed his eyes, voice icy. ""You got a tattoo on your arm, too?""

I didn't answer. Marco seemed to take my silence as confirmation, and the indifference in his eyes flickered, replaced by something sharper. ""You just have to hang around with that delinquent, huh? Is your plan to turn yourself into trash like her?""

I knew Marco's words could cut deep; when things were at their worst between us, every sentence was a poisoned blade, aimed to wound.

But he didn't get to talk about Iliana Matlock.

Because she was my one, only, and best friend.

The faint smell of smoke clung to Marco, making my stomach churn, veins throbbing at my temples.

Pain surged through my gut, and I gripped the door handle, knuckles white and shaking, unable to hold back.

But the slap I meant for his face never landed. Instead, he caught my wrist, his grip tight, his skin pressing against the old scars.

I saw the flash of shock on Marco's face as he caught sight of the marks. ""The scars on your wrist...""

He didn't get to finish. This time, I slapped him hard across the face.

His head jerked to the side, pale skin blooming red where my hand landed. I'd hit him with everything I had.

The smell of tobacco wrapped around my nerves, cold fear crawling up from the soles of my feet, spreading through me until I was numb.

I wrenched free from his grasp, my wrist already burning and red.

I gripped my own hands together, trying to keep myself from shaking so violently.

""Briana...""

Chapter 4

""Get out.""

I kept my eyes down, staring at my feet.

""Don't touch me.

""Get out!""

Marco left.

I ran to the bathroom, scrubbing my hand with a towel like I'd lost my mind—scrubbing the spot where he'd touched me.

The rough skin split open, blood mixing with icy water, the vivid color sending a jolt through my brain. I gripped the edge of the sink, gasping for air until I finally calmed down.

When the food delivery arrived at noon, the driver handed me a massive bag. I spread everything out on the coffee table.

The rich aroma overwhelmed my senses, and after two days of hunger, my stomach surrendered.

I grabbed my fork and shoveled it all in, barely tasting anything as I filled myself to the brim.

But I ate too much. My stomach churned violently, and I ended up in the bathroom, vomiting it all back out.

The damp bathroom floor soaked through my clothes, the pain so raw and real it felt like I was teetering on death's edge. Lying there, I scrolled through my phone, flipping slowly through old messages.

The last conversation stopped a month ago.

Iliana's final message asked me what I'd eaten that day.

I hadn't replied.

I hadn't told her when I got my diagnosis, either.

Five years of friendship—so long it felt carved into my life, so short it could be erased in just a few hours.

""Are you sure you want to delete your chat history with 'Lia'?""

The words glared up at me.

But the pain in my abdomen grew sharper, as if urging me on, and I pressed delete.

Five years of memories vanished in an instant, along with the last tie I had to this world.

The day I got my diagnosis, the doctor looked me in the eye and spoke earnestly, ""It's late-stage stomach cancer, but if you stay positive and pursue treatment, you could live another two or three years.""

I smiled and thanked him, but didn't respond.

I had no reason to fight for more time.

My brother once hoped—desperately—that I would die.

I drifted through the days at home, barely aware of how much time had passed.

My life became a vicious cycle of hunger, binge eating, and vomiting, each round chipping away at what was left of me.

One day, I happened to check my phone and realized an important date was coming up.

I tidied myself up and decided to go to the mall to buy a dress that would suit the occasion.

When I looked in the mirror, I noticed how quickly my cheeks had hollowed out, my skin so pale it was almost colorless.

After a moment, I put on some makeup.

It was a weekday, so the mall wasn't crowded.

I wandered aimlessly from floor to floor until a display window caught my eye—a beautiful white dress.

As I walked in, a sales associate greeted me warmly. I was just about to point out the dress in the window when a lively voice rang out behind me, ""Marc, that white dress is gorgeous!""

Some things happen by pure coincidence.

Tamara walked in at that exact moment, her wide, doe-like eyes meeting mine. She lit up instantly, calling out, ""Bria!""

As if nothing had ever come between us.

Marco stood at the entrance, his gaze icy as he looked my way.

How nice, I thought. The prodigal ""little sister"" returns from abroad, and Marco's playing the doting brother, taking her shopping.

I forced a sarcastic smile and ignored them.

""That dress—the medium. Please wrap it up for me.

""And I'll take one too, medium.""

Tamara and I both pointed to the same white dress.

The sales associate glanced over apologetically. ""This style has been really popular this year. There's only one medium left—the one on the mannequin. If you two don't mind, I can check for other styles or see if we have more in stock.""

Tamara frowned, just about to speak. ""Well—""

""Wrap it up for me,"" I cut her off without hesitation.

The sales associate nodded and went to retrieve it.

""Bria,"" Tamara called out suddenly.

I looked up at her. ""What is it?""

""Could you let me have the dress?"" she asked, her voice tinged with guilt. ""You know how much I love white dresses, Bria. You hardly ever wear them...""

No shame at all.

I glanced at Marco, but he kept his eyes down, silently letting Tamara do as she pleased.

It was laughable.

After all these years, nothing had changed.

Everything Tamara liked, she expected me to give up for her.

Toys, clothes, awards... and even family.

""No,"" I replied, cold and firm.

Tamara fell silent, watching as I took the wrapped dress from the associate. Her eyes shimmered with tears as she lowered her head and retreated to Marco's side.

He leaned in and said something to her; she brightened immediately, looping her arm through his, beaming with delight.

She shot me a quick glance, as if to flaunt her victory—my brother had become hers.

The truth was, the dress didn't matter at all.

Chapter 5

What she really wanted was for me to see that my brother seemed to love her more.

But who cares?

It's always been this way, for as long as I can remember.

The days slipped by, one after another.

My health kept getting worse.

Marco never reached out to me again.

I flipped through the calendar, counting the dwindling number of days I had left.

Until Tamara's text arrived.

She invited me to a banquet, tacking on a line at the end. ""Bria, Marc's really worried about you. This is a good chance for you two to patch things up.""

Her ability to play dumb was as sharp as ever.

I glanced at the calendar and decided to go.

The ballroom glittered with golden light, filled with well-dressed people drifting from group to group. The clinking of glasses and the hum of conversation blended into a lively roar.

After being alone for so long, I felt out of place, exposed in the middle of all that noise.

Not far away, Marco and Tamara stood together, chatting with someone else.

Marco glanced over, his expression shifting as he turned slightly in my direction, but didn't move.

Like he was waiting for me to come over and start a conversation.

But I didn't.

Tamara caught sight of me, too.

She immediately smiled and walked over, but I turned away and slipped out of the crowded hall without hesitation.

The wind on the balcony was fierce.

I sat on the edge, listening to the laughter and chatter drifting out from the party behind me, counting down the minutes until I could go home.

Suddenly, someone grabbed me from behind, and I fell backward into a stranger's arms.

The overpowering stench of tobacco closed in around me, and nausea surged up so fast I could barely hold it back.

I shoved the man away, fighting to break free, and caught sight of Tamara standing behind him.

She wore a beautiful dress and winked at me.

My phone buzzed quietly in my purse. I picked it up and saw her message.

""Bria, Owen saw you just now and asked me to introduce you. So I brought him over.

""He's a good guy; you two should get along.""

""I don't—""

Before I could finish typing, Owen Terrell grabbed my wrist. His eyes lingered on my chest, then flicked away as if nothing had happened.

Just that look was enough to bring all my old fears rushing back.

I slapped his hand away.

There was nothing in my stomach, but I couldn't help retching. He leaned closer, and I shrank back, inching away.

Dim light.

Heavy smoke.

A tall, unfamiliar man.

All of it snapped the last thread of reason in my mind.

I covered my mouth, gagging, and with trembling hands pulled a switchblade from my purse, waving it wildly.

The blade grazed his skin, and blood bloomed, coloring my world in red.

""Briana!""

A furious shout rang out as someone smacked my hand, knocking the knife to the floor, where it glinted in the cold moonlight outside the window.

""What the hell is wrong with you?!""

Marco's voice cracked like thunder.

I felt like someone had gripped my throat, my temples pulsing, something threatening to explode inside my head.

I clutched my mouth, my eyes burning and dry, gasping for air like a wounded animal.

Tamara swept in, her dress swirling, and gasped when she saw the scene, her voice trembling. ""What happened?

""Owen, why are you bleeding?

""Didn't you say you liked Bria and wanted to talk to her?""

The stranger frowned. ""I didn't do anything. She just pulled out a knife...""

""Marc,"" Tamara called Marco's name, her meaning clear. ""I trust Owen's character.""

The implication was obvious.

I struggled to breathe, reached out, and tried to slap her, but Marco shoved me away, and I crashed to the floor.

The three of them stared down at me.

Every part of me was hurting.

I was like a broken robot, barely holding myself together.

I heard Marco's cold voice, ""What the hell is wrong with you?!

""Briana.

""Are you sick or something?""

Briana.

Are you sick?

Are you—

Sick?

I wanted to cry.

But the tears wouldn't come.

I braced myself against the wall, pushing through the agony as I struggled to my feet.

""Yes.

""I'm sick.""

I wouldn't be alive much longer.

I leaned against the door, using every ounce of strength just to stand upright.

I knew my stomach was empty, nothing left to throw up.

But suddenly my throat felt sweet.

Thick blood welled up from my mouth, staining my clothes, dripping onto the floor.

I saw Marco freeze.

Saw him instinctively reach out to touch me.

But I stepped back.

""Why don't you ask me?

""Why don't you ask what he did to me?

""You're always ready to believe Tamara, never once willing to hear me out, never wanting to listen.

""Because you never cared.

""In the end, it's always my fault—

""Because I'm the sinner.

""I owe Mom her life.

""Is that it?""

The room went silent.

My brother was shaken for a moment.

Then he calmed instantly.

I heard him reply, in the same flat tone as always, ""Isn't that true?""

Isn't that true?

""Yeah.""

Still no tears.

Even though my eyes burned like fire, not a single drop would fall.

""So I'm about to pay Mom back.""

This was the last time I'd ever call him ""brother"".

I looked at Marco, curved my lips into a smile. ""I'm about to die.

""Are you happy now, brother?""",2,1768042171.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False

1q915d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/1q915d8/my_coffee_table_has_become_a_charging_station/,My Coffee Table Has Become A Charging Station Disaster Zone,"I've been slowly adding smart home devices to my place over the past year. Smart Table, Smart TV, Smart lights, speakers,and  security cameras, the usual stuff. Everything works great but I've created a new problem: my living room coffee smart table is now just a mess of charging cables, remotes, and random devices that need to be plugged in constantly.


It looks terrible. I've got phone chargers draped over the edge, the TV remote next to three different smart home remotes I barely use, a tangled mess of USB cables, and my tablet propped up against a stack of books because I have nowhere else to put it while it charges.


I tried buying one of those charging organizers from Target but it just sits on top of the table taking up even more space. My girlfriend keeps complaining about how cluttered everything looks and honestly she's not wrong.


Was browsing around trying to find furniture solutions and stumbled across these smart tables on Alibaba that have built in wireless charging, USB ports, and cable management built into the design. Some even have Bluetooth speakers and LED lighting integrated, which seems excessive but also kind of cool?


The concept makes sense. Furniture that's designed for all the tech we actually use instead of just pretending we still live in a world without devices. But they looked expensive and I'm skeptical about buying furniture sight unseen from overseas. What if it shows up broken or looks cheap in person?


I don't know if I'm solving a problem or just finding an expensive way to avoid organizing my cables properly. Has anyone actually replaced furniture to deal with tech clutter, or should I just buy some damn cable ties and move on?",1,1768042140.0,homeautomation,4,0.67,False
1q9151d,https://www.reddit.com/r/thewardrobewithin/comments/1q9151d/a_tale_of_my_inner_child/,A Tale of my Inner Child,"Working with this system has clarified several processes that I have encountered in the past.

I like that I can interpret and name things now. It gives me, so to speak, a bird's-eye view of my style and, above all, what feelings, desires, and expectations I had or still have.

The other day I fell into a deep hole of sadness and grief because I suddenly remembered an old version of myself, how good I was doing (but at the same time I wasn't doing well), let’s call her Pastel Mysty. She was always in a good mood, a light for others and inspiring, unstoppable. Always dressing in pastels and fun stuff from head to toe. She is my Air Inner Child. Free, light and happy.

For years I styled myself exclusively for my Inner Child and let myself be guided by its positive and light energies. 

About a year and a half ago I had a consultation with John Kitchener. My color palette does not include pastels.

I got a pretty “earthy” palette. First it was a shock, but I really was exited to see what will happen when I wear them. I gradually replaced the pastels with my colors, but I hadn't anticipated the effect it would have. At the same time, I also quit coffee, going for walks more often and allowing myself more space (doing nothing). I hoped it would make me calmer, less nervous and less sick. And that's exactly what happened. 

This caused roots to grow that I didn't even know were there.

It wasn't just because of the Kitchener consultation, I had some good reasons to leave Pastel Mysty behind, because my Inner Child was exhausting. I am not a child anymore and my energy is limited. It took a toll on my body. I was too active and exited, always pushing myself, and I didn't take enough breaks. I wasn't nourishing myself the way I should have. I had less substance on my body back then and lacked grounding in body and mind. And the airy pastel colors couldn't hold me. They made me flying away.

Now, I feel like a different person. I don’t relate to Pastel Mysty anymore, I am a bit more substantial, calm and feel more healthy. I enjoy wearing deep colors, I appreciate the gravity they give me. I feel save and more relaxed. 

Today I can look back with joy and remember Pastel Mysty in a thankful way. Her uplifting approach helped me through the stress of the pandemic and helped me coping with the death of a loved one, gave me the strength to function despite of this.

My Inner Child served its purpose. But she’s not the whole of my being! I felt that, but I didn’t had the knowledge and vocabulary to explain what was lacking or even happening. Today I know that I missed the grounding Earth power of my Sovereign type. Yes, even the emotional depths of my Shadow (Water), because I was denying myself to have any (negative) feeling, because I feared they would pull me down into an endless dark hole.

What has remained is my love for some playful magic and wonder, I am still fueled by a fantasy of fairy tales, myths and legends. My Inner Child has its place on the lap of my Sovereign type. But she doesn’t rule anymore.

Like, I'm talking generic stuff that could've been for anyone. But I've learned a lot through trial and error, and I wanted to share some [romantic gift ideas for girlfriend](https://wildfireoil.com/romantic-gifts-ideas-girlfriend-2025-2/?srsltid=AfmBOorTqcL3GoXqSvUGKpr1rOSWMxmZpYSPWvjDAs0D_mfEOl48KI0v) that actually worked in case anyone else is struggling with finding the perfect [romantic presents for girlfriend](https://wildfireoil.com/romantic-gifts-ideas-girlfriend-2025-2/?srsltid=AfmBOorTqcL3GoXqSvUGKpr1rOSWMxmZpYSPWvjDAs0D_mfEOl48KI0v).

# What I've learned about romantic gifts for her:

**The ""just because"" gifts hit different.** Seriously, **surprise romantic gifts for girlfriend** on a random Tuesday mean way more than something expected on Valentine's Day. Last month I sent flowers to her workplace on a Wednesday with a note that just said ""thinking about you."" Her coworkers were jealous and she texted me like 50 times lol.

**Listen to the things she mentions in passing.** I started keeping notes on my phone whenever she'd mention something she liked or wanted. Three months later when I got her that specific book she'd mentioned once, she was shocked I remembered. It's not about the book - it's about showing you actually listen. These become the most **romantic memorable gifts for girlfriend**.

**Experiences > stuff (most of the time).** We did a surprise cooking class together and it's still one of our favorite memories. Way better than another piece of jewelry she might wear once. Experience-based **romantic gifts for girlfriends** create lasting memories.

# Some romantic gifts for her that worked really well:

1. **Custom star map** \- I got one showing the stars on the night we met. Cheesy? Maybe. Did she love it? Absolutely. One of the best **romantic gift ideas for girlfriend** I've tried.
2. **""Open when..."" letters** \- I made like 10 envelopes: ""Open when you're stressed,"" ""Open when you miss me,"" ""Open when you need a laugh."" She still hasn't opened all of them and it's been 6 months. Perfect [surprise romantic gifts for girlfriend.](https://wildfireoil.com/romantic-gifts-ideas-girlfriend-2025-2/?srsltid=AfmBOorTqcL3GoXqSvUGKpr1rOSWMxmZpYSPWvjDAs0D_mfEOl48KI0v)
3. **Recreating our first date** \- Same restaurant, same order, same everything. Then I gave her a small necklace with the coordinates of where we met. This one got the waterworks. Definitely one of the most **romantic memorable gifts for girlfriend** I've given.
4. **Photo book** \- Not just random pics, but I wrote little notes on each page about the memory. Took me forever but totally worth it.
5. **Playlist where the song titles spell out a message** \- Okay this was hard to pull off but so fun to make.

# Things that didn't work (learn from my mistakes):

* Getting her kitchen appliances for her birthday (even if she mentioned wanting them). Pro tip: if it plugs in and does chores, it's not romantic.
* Gifts I wanted to use too. That Switch game? Not a [romantic present for girlfriend](https://wildfireoil.com/romantic-gifts-ideas-girlfriend-2025-2/?srsltid=AfmBOorTqcL3GoXqSvUGKpr1rOSWMxmZpYSPWvjDAs0D_mfEOl48KI0v), dude.
* Forgetting the card. THE CARD MATTERS. Write something heartfelt even if you think it sounds dumb.
* Last minute gas station flowers. Just... don't.

# For the broke college students (budget-friendly romantic gifts girlfriend):

You don't need money for **romantic gifts for her**:

* Handwritten love letter (sounds old school but girls LOVE these)
* Breakfast in bed on a weekend
* Plan a whole date night at home - cook dinner, set up candles, put your phone away
* Make a list of reasons you love her and hide them around her apartment
* Create a playlist of songs that remind you of her

# My current favorite approach for romantic presents for girlfriend:

Mix small **surprise romantic gifts for girlfriend** throughout the year with bigger gifts for occasions. Like, I'll randomly bring her favorite coffee on a Saturday morning, or leave a note in her car before work. Keeps things fresh and shows I'm thinking about her all the time, not just when I have to.

# The real secret to perfect romantic gifts for girlfriends:

The best **romantic gift ideas for girlfriend** show you PAY ATTENTION. Notice what she likes, what makes her smile, what she talks about. Keep track of it. Then when gift time comes, you're not scrambling - you already know what she'd love.

Also, presentation matters! Even a small gift feels special if you wrap it nicely and give it to her in a romantic setting. Candles, music, good lighting - set the mood. That's how you turn ordinary [romantic gifts for her](https://wildfireoil.com/romantic-gifts-ideas-girlfriend-2025-2/?srsltid=AfmBOorTqcL3GoXqSvUGKpr1rOSWMxmZpYSPWvjDAs0D_mfEOl48KI0v) into **romantic memorable gifts for girlfriend**.

I just moved into my first apartment, and I'm not sure how I should lay everything out.

These are some of my requirements:

* Sofabed (can fit 2 people sleeping on it)
* TV/TV stand
* Coffee table
* Dining table and chairs

Ideally, I'd also be able to fit a 150x70mm desk somewhere in the living room so that it doesn't have to go in the master bedroom, but it might be difficult since the living room doesn't have that much space.

I'm leaning towards a darker colour scheme for the furniture, but I'm not sure if that would look nice (I also made another post about my bedroom's design). The IKEA mockup included in this post is an example of the colour scheme I had in mind.

I am a university student on his end of 2nd year. I have made many friends in University and now I am at a point where I do not have any proper ""friends"". I had a pretty rough last 2 semester, loosing so many friends and making enemy out of them. But now I am trying to make new friends and possibly trying to date someone.

I made a lot of female friends but it seems like none of them are actually interested in me romantically. And even if I am interested into someone, either they are in a relationship which later gets revealed or they are just straight up not interested in me. I am an average looking guy, I work hard, I am fit and I have good grades and I dress up nicely. I do not have a gym body but I have a slim figure and I hit the gym pretty regularly. 

Recently I have been noticing some desperate changes in me, I used to help random people, any friends of mine, without expecting something in return. **However, I am now helping people and always expecting something in return. Maybe a pretty girl asked for my help, I would ask her to treat me with coffee or chocolate. Or sometime just straight up asking money. Why is that ?** What I deduced is that because I used to help people often and often times these random people would just left me after gaining help from me. And this is now triggering me with a constant loop of insecurity. 

Another issue that I am facing is that, I want to have a pretty girlfriend, I do not know why I want love or a girlfriend, but I am being desperate for Love and attention. What do I do to get rid of this thought or what do I do to get a hot and pretty girlfriend who would genuinely care about me? Or what do I do to be contempt with myself, honestly I am pretty desperate for answer on any kind of self improvements and any kind of work I need to do to be better at my life.",1,1768041268.0,selfhelp,0,1.0,False

It's a coming-of-age, college romance.

***Isla's POV:***

I scanned my room, searching for any sign of disorganization. In my frantic anxiety, I had deep-cleaned my entire room, but I could still feel a sick mixture of excitement and nervousness bubbling in my gut. Today was the day. After eighteen years of holding my breath, I was finally starting college. I had planned every second of it: perfect grades, valedictorian, internships, clubs, competitions. While everyone else was sneaking out to parties and having a normal high school experience, I was filling binders and flashcards. I studied until I physically couldn't anymore. It was the only way to save her.

My train of thought reminded me of my drunk dad passed out downstairs, stoking my eagerness to get out of this house. The only memories I had of that man were him unconscious on the alcohol-stained couch, with a glistening bottle of vodka still in his hand. When I pestered him for a crumb of his attention, he always pushed me away, ignored me, or fell into a screaming fit. The resurgence of these memories reminded me of his other victim-my mom. I see the agony in her eyes when he leaves for his daily visit to the bar and abandons us for days at a time. To compensate, I strive to be the best daughter I can. I don't mind. That's how I've become the best in my class, in my school, and soon, the entire country.

I forced myself to lie down on my bed and at least try to sleep. As my heartbeat eased, I broke into a grin. This was the beginning of my new life.

The next morning, I woke up to my mom shouting at me to get downstairs and the incessant ringing of my alarm. I slapped my phone to make it shut up, but I had to attack it for it to finally stop.

I quickly picked up my neatly aligned school supplies and tidily arranged them in my school bag. I had already picked out the outfit I was going to wear, the makeup, even down to the breakfast I was going to eat. The clothes were out on my small bed, pretty but respectable. I had sifted through my entire closet for the perfect outfit.

I threw on my thrifted, dark wash jeans and layered a Henley. The babydoll cut hugged my curves just right, and the red made my skin glow. I clasped the little jewelry I had and shook out my curls until they behaved.

As I rushed downstairs, I spotted my mom fussing over breakfast. Bacon crackled in the pan, and the kitchen was still thick with the smell of coffee and lemon cleaner. I gave her a quick kiss and reached around her to grab a bowl. My mom gossiped about the neighbors, touching up her lipstick before continuing to rant about how Mrs. Alburn was certifiably insane because she painted her bathroom an ugly blue. At 6:00 am in the morning, I wasn't in the mood for pointless gossip, but I nodded and listened anyway to be polite. Before I could sit down, she looked me over.

""Is... that... what you're going to wear?""

I froze, and my stomach dropped.

""Is it ugly?"" I looked down at my outfit as if seeing it for the first time. Last night I had thought it was cute, but now I could feel heat prickling up my neck. Maybe the lace was unprofessional. Maybe all of it was.

She didn't answer right away. She just kept her eyes on me, jaw tightening by a millimeter.

""It'll have to do,"" she finally said. ""We need to get there early to get a good parking spot.""

I nodded, swallowing the urge to justify myself. It was fine. It didn't matter. Today was supposed to be a good day.

We loaded my stuff into the car in silence, the trunk filling with boxes faster than either of us could think of anything to say. As we pulled out of the driveway, I watched the house shrink in the rearview mirror, the peeling paint, the dead lawn, the rickety blinds. Four hours to Berkeley. Four hours until I could breathe.

When we arrived, my heart began fluttering. I kept fixing my shirt, as if that would stop my hands from shaking. I rushed to unload the car, and as we strolled down the pavement, I froze momentarily. The towering dormitories stood intimidatingly, and when we entered, I was immediately lost. God knows how long until we finally found my dorm, a secluded room in a dark corner.

But when we opened the door, I found something-no, someone-that was sitting on *MY* bed.

We met at a work party through a mutual friend in September, we got talking had a lot in common and that night led to me spending the night at hers. From there due to being co workers we agreed to keep things secret at work. We would sometimes sneak away for forbidden kisses in hallways when nobody was watching etc but mostly it was weekends together and we would go away on dates, she was always a busy person as she has a full time job and kids so I’d maybe get a morning text, then a few more once her kids went to bed around 7pm. She could go the entire day with no messaging. For me this was our version of “hot and cold”

About 3 weeks in she suggested we go away together on a mini cruise, things were great, ideal even. Around 4 weeks I accidentally met her kids as their dad dropped them off early. Not intentional but she did panic a little. I managed to reassure her and things were great. From that point on, I saw her maybe 3x a week, often she would invite me to have dinner with her kids, or we’d have “family days” out involving road trips. I loved these times, weirdly becoming bonded/attached the family dynamic. Little things like helping them get ready for school if I had stayed over the night before etc.

She started to express a few wobbles here and there that she wasn’t good enough, that she worried that maybe I deserved my own kids etc but I was understanding and managed to put her mind at ease every time.

8-9 weeks in roughly, after I had met her sister (and sisters husband) on a date night she messages me to say that she’s worried again - you see we both had seperate Christmas work nights out in November (same night, but different teams/parties) she initially told me she’d meet me out as her night out was just bowling, then said a few more people are going so she might not meet me, I said it’s fine either way just let me know. Send us a text on the night no pressure. But you see she felt like it was pressure for some reason, and said it made her realise about how we’ve moved quickly without what she called “a stable base” for our relationship as she attaches slowly and takes her a while to warm up but I’m very special, and she loves what I do for her and the kids etc. she asked me for a week off, to sort her head out. I agreed, telling her I understand and I’m here if she needs anything.

For this “week off” we don’t talk the Sunday, Monday she messages me asking if I’m ignoring her, I said no I’m just giving you space, Tuesday we’re talking but very shallow, casual low pressure talk “how’s work” etc, Wednesday she rings me out of the blue tells me she’s bought me lunch and to go meet her. Friday (work night out) she not only texts me to meet her, but then comes back to mine, and confesses she thinks she’s falling in love with me. I said it back and we spent the entire weekend together (so much for a week off eh?)

Things return back to “normal” shes back to inviting me over for tea with the kids and days/trips out etc, things are great.

2 weeks before Christmas we do secret Santa with our teams in the office.

One of her best friends is on my team, and she’s told my ex that I was flirting with another girl during the secret Santa event. My FA girlfriend in question at the time rang me, in tears asking what’s going on. I reassured her nothing, we were talking video games. She understands, she knows her friend is a gossip and always adds things on but I made a point (not because she asked me too) but from that point on to never be alone or go to lunch with this girl that my FA girlfriend was jealous of. Just incase.

We’re in bed the next night, she’s talking about marriage, asking about the possibility of her having my child in a year or so maybe. I’m feeling really bonded at this point.

Few days later, her secret santa present - a sex toy with a note saying “call me” from a guy on her team who had/has previously expressed interest however he has a girlfriend so she said she has/would never go there as she finds him gross. I told her that the toy is funny, the note annoyed me but it’s nothing to do with her, I’m annoyed with him. She agreed, everything is fine.

She tells me from there that she saw what I had did with the girl from my secret Santa, and she knows people talk in our office so she’s not gonna go to lunch with this guy either unless there’s a group.

Few days later she messaged me saying she can’t go to lunch with me because she’s busy but messages about 10 minutes later to say I just wanted you to hear it from me, gone to lunch with that guy - he surprised me and just tagged along. Don’t hate me. I found out later they didn’t just go for coffee but also sat alone upstairs; 

I said that’s okay thanks for telling me but it did upset me. We had a small fight about it, her telling me she’d never do anything with him. I told her I’m not jealous of him, I don’t think she would do anything like that, but you set a boundary and then you’ve sort of skirted it. She didn’t/couldn’t understand what I meant and kept thinking I was jealous.

Anyway; we patched this up, Friday was a date night but she seemed quiet, off even. I could definitely sense the shift.

Week after this, she invited me over for Christmas with the family. Slept over Christmas Eve, matching pajamas for Christmas Day, things were great Christmas Eve but in the evening in bed I could sense she was off however I gave her space to regulate, I can see why she would be maybe still upset,but also the overwhelming nature of the kids, Christmas etc. I didn’t read into it. Christmas Day is fine, we have tea, but then she goes to bed from 3-8pm saying she’s exhausted, leaving me and her kids alone. At 8pm she wakes up, we chat for an hour about surface level stuff. 9pm back in bed, no intimacy no kiss goodnight.

Boxing Day I ask if she wanted to do anything as she’s child free until new year, she said she wanted some time to chill. I said alright no worries, I’m going to visit my dad in another city. I get a kiss on the cheek and I left.

Few hours later, I get a text saying what she said before during the week off. She’s overwhelmed, can’t give me what I need, she’s now unsure of her feelings and the “vibe” has felt off since “our fight” I tried to reassure saying I understand all the stress and I’m sorry if I’ve been off etc, maybe we just need some time to think and she can chill whilst I’m away because I don’t want her to rush into anything whilst I’m away and we can talk when I get back.

She agreed; but a few hours later I get another text saying it’s the right decision for her, she wants to end it.

We had no contact since, I didn’t even reply.

Thursday just gone (8th of Jan) is the first time I’ve seen her since. We locked eyes twice and she darts away straight away. I said hey, she said hey you okay, I said fine thanks you? She said good, all of this as I walked past her. I didn’t stop to talk. I hadn’t told anyone about the break up, but I found out yesterday she had told her best mate which is understandable, I know this because her best mate tried to fish more information from me (suggesting my ex hasn’t told the full story)

Anyway, I’ll be seeing her again Monday and I’ve never felt so conflicted in my life.

On the one hand - I really did fall for her and the family dynamic, I think I found my place and sort of comfortably fell into my role, it was very disarming. Ive never felt so blindsided and I don’t know what to do. The fact she won’t meet eyes with me tells me she’s feeling something right?

On the other hand - it was so short lived, maybe I’m just fooling myself, but why would you invite me to Christmas with your family etc if you felt unsure? It’s so bizzare to me.

Can any FA’s please, I know it’s a lot but can someone explain what happened? Do I approach her and talk to her? I shouldn’t trust ChatGPT but that’s telling me that there’s only a 15% chance she’s gonna reach out and less than 5% it’s gonna end in us trying again.

Do I let go? Do I talk to her? Yesterdaybwould be the end of week 2 since break so maybe she’s still feeling huge relief? I don’t know.  ",2,1768041163.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

My Jeep isn’t just a vehicle—
it’s my home, my independence, and the lifeline that lets me keep working on my food truck business.

I’ve been pouring everything I have into building a fleet of fusion food trucks and a coffee truck, but right now, the Jeep is acting up. It’s having issues starting and holding power, which makes getting to work, sourcing supplies, and moving forward incredibly difficult. 

I’m not asking for charity—I’m asking for a way to keep my independence while I build something meaningful. Any support via this post would go directly toward Jeep repairs and keeping my plans alive. Every bit helps me stay mobile, safe, and focused on turning my business dream into reality.

I said that’s okay thanks for telling me but it did upset me. We had a small fight about it, her telling me she’d never do anything with him. I told her I’m not jealous of him, I don’t think she would do anything like that, but you set a boundary and then you’ve sort of skirted it. She didn’t/couldn’t understand what I meant and kept thinking I was jealous.

Anyway; we patched this up, Friday was a date night but she seemed quiet, off even. I could definitely sense the shift.

Week after this, she invited me over for Christmas with the family. Slept over Christmas Eve, matching pajamas for Christmas Day, things were great Christmas Eve but in the evening in bed I could sense she was off however I gave her space to regulate, I can see why she would be maybe still upset,but also the overwhelming nature of the kids, Christmas etc. I didn’t read into it. Christmas Day is fine, we have tea, but then she goes to bed from 3-8pm saying she’s exhausted, leaving me and her kids alone. At 8pm she wakes up, we chat for an hour about surface level stuff. 9pm back in bed, no intimacy no kiss goodnight.

Boxing Day I ask if she wanted to do anything as she’s child free until new year, she said she wanted some time to chill. I said alright no worries, I’m going to visit my dad in another city. I get a kiss on the cheek and I left.

Few hours later, I get a text saying what she said before during the week off. She’s overwhelmed, can’t give me what I need, she’s now unsure of her feelings and the “vibe” has felt off since “our fight” I tried to reassure saying I understand all the stress and I’m sorry if I’ve been off etc, maybe we just need some time to think and she can chill whilst I’m away because I don’t want her to rush into anything whilst I’m away and we can talk when I get back.

She agreed; but a few hours later I get another text saying it’s the right decision for her, she wants to end it.

We had no contact since, I didn’t even reply.

Thursday just gone (8th of Jan) is the first time I’ve seen her since. We locked eyes twice and she darts away straight away. I said hey, she said hey you okay, I said fine thanks you? She said good, all of this as I walked past her. I didn’t stop to talk. I hadn’t told anyone about the break up, but I found out yesterday she had told her best mate which is understandable, I know this because her best mate tried to fish more information from me (suggesting my ex hasn’t told the full story)

Anyway, I’ll be seeing her again Monday and I’ve never felt so conflicted in my life.

On the one hand - I really did fall for her and the family dynamic, I think I found my place and sort of comfortably fell into my role, it was very disarming. Ive never felt so blindsided and I don’t know what to do. The fact she won’t meet eyes with me tells me she’s feeling something right?

On the other hand - it was so short lived, maybe I’m just fooling myself, but why would you invite me to Christmas with your family etc if you felt unsure? It’s so bizzare to me.

Can any FA’s please, I know it’s a lot but can someone explain what happened? Do I approach her and talk to her? I shouldn’t trust ChatGPT but that’s telling me that there’s only a 15% chance she’s gonna reach out and less than 5% it’s gonna end in us trying again.

Do I let go? Do I talk to her? Yesterdaybwould be the end of week 2 since break so maybe she’s still feeling huge relief? I don’t know.  ",1,1768041007.0,FearfulAvoidants,2,1.0,False

I want the solution to respond better to the situation and regulating my emotions. I have tried therapy and they make me victim. At the moment I am not comfortable with that approach. I want to look forward in my life with better approach 
I am 32 and my husband is 2 years younger. We were having verbal disagreement on a very random topic. My voice increased a bit. He said to lower it and that my  voice is irritating. I was in a flow to finish the sentence and then be quiet. Meanwhile he couldn’t control and he imitated me with blabbering sound. He knows it triggers me. Last time he did I threw a coffee on him. This time he did I warned him not do again and I controlled myself. He did again and I slapped him. He did again and I warned him again to don’t repeat it. I slapped him again. He did another three times and slapped him three more times. I tried to think very hard why I lost my mind and every time I slapped him a voice was telling me to not repeat it even if he continues to mimic me. But I couldn’t control. A random summary - in our marriage we both have hit each other many times. The reason is always the same - one person just triggers other knowingly. It’s very kiddish but I don’t know if it is normal in every marriage or ours is special one. I have seeked for divorce many times because I hate to see this version of myself. But he will literally beg and cry to stay. This happens 1-2 times a year. If I have to look back I have been victim of bullying since childhood where people have mocked me or rejected me for who I am. I have been quiet and  studious kid in school who mind her own business. But the “cool” kids of the school found me weird as I was teacher’s favourite kid.  They would bully me in school bus or neighbourhood. I would just walk away. Never reacted. Came back home and did my homework, played video games. No one in family knew. My family had lived on low wages and my cousins have made fun of that also. My cousin joined the bully group of my neighbourhood once. At this moment of my life me and my cousin are maintaining good relations and she is a changed person now. Slowly I started loosing grades and have been struggling to live my life with money, power , dignity and respect. I struggle hard to be part of society and make a living. Growing up I was fat shamed also by colleagues and relatives.  Both me and husband started career with minimum wages. He is doing very good now in terms of money. But I lost job during Covid  and struggling since then to study again and apply for interviews. I am slowly becoming better to not let emotions come in between my productivity. But situations like this makes me go off track and I overthink a lot later. I don’t know how much of my past makes sense to my present reaction. But I am tired of looking back. I seek respect a lot. Basic minimal respect which every human deserves. I am not asking anyone to bow down for me. But just treat me as human and let me be who I am. I don’t think I am asking too much. I just want to look forward in my life with better reaction , peace , better living and work. I am not so keen on marriage from now onwards because I just lost interest to put effort to it. Leaving it on auto mode because my husband can’t deal with divorce. ",2,1768041005.0,Marriage,12,1.0,False

It's a coming-of-age, college romance.

***Isla's POV:***

I scanned my room, searching for any sign of disorganization. In my frantic anxiety, I had deep-cleaned my entire room, but I could still feel a sick mixture of excitement and nervousness bubbling in my gut. Today was the day. After eighteen years of holding my breath, I was finally starting college. I had planned every second of it: perfect grades, valedictorian, internships, clubs, competitions. While everyone else was sneaking out to parties and having a normal high school experience, I was filling binders and flashcards. I studied until I physically couldn't anymore. It was the only way to save her.

My train of thought reminded me of my drunk dad passed out downstairs, stoking my eagerness to get out of this house. The only memories I had of that man were him unconscious on the alcohol-stained couch, with a glistening bottle of vodka still in his hand. When I pestered him for a crumb of his attention, he always pushed me away, ignored me, or fell into a screaming fit. The resurgence of these memories reminded me of his other victim-my mom. I see the agony in her eyes when he leaves for his daily visit to the bar and abandons us for days at a time. To compensate, I strive to be the best daughter I can. I don't mind. That's how I've become the best in my class, in my school, and soon, the entire country.

I forced myself to lie down on my bed and at least try to sleep. As my heartbeat eased, I broke into a grin. This was the beginning of my new life.

The next morning, I woke up to my mom shouting at me to get downstairs and the incessant ringing of my alarm. I slapped my phone to make it shut up, but I had to attack it for it to finally stop.

I quickly picked up my neatly aligned school supplies and tidily arranged them in my school bag. I had already picked out the outfit I was going to wear, the makeup, even down to the breakfast I was going to eat. The clothes were out on my small bed, pretty but respectable. I had sifted through my entire closet for the perfect outfit.

I threw on my thrifted, dark wash jeans and layered a Henley. The babydoll cut hugged my curves just right, and the red made my skin glow. I clasped the little jewelry I had and shook out my curls until they behaved.

As I rushed downstairs, I spotted my mom fussing over breakfast. Bacon crackled in the pan, and the kitchen was still thick with the smell of coffee and lemon cleaner. I gave her a quick kiss and reached around her to grab a bowl. My mom gossiped about the neighbors, touching up her lipstick before continuing to rant about how Mrs. Alburn was certifiably insane because she painted her bathroom an ugly blue. At 6:00 am in the morning, I wasn't in the mood for pointless gossip, but I nodded and listened anyway to be polite. Before I could sit down, she looked me over.

""Is... that... what you're going to wear?""

I froze, and my stomach dropped.

""Is it ugly?"" I looked down at my outfit as if seeing it for the first time. Last night I had thought it was cute, but now I could feel heat prickling up my neck. Maybe the lace was unprofessional. Maybe all of it was.

She didn't answer right away. She just kept her eyes on me, jaw tightening by a millimeter.

""It'll have to do,"" she finally said. ""We need to get there early to get a good parking spot.""

I nodded, swallowing the urge to justify myself. It was fine. It didn't matter. Today was supposed to be a good day.

We loaded my stuff into the car in silence, the trunk filling with boxes faster than either of us could think of anything to say. As we pulled out of the driveway, I watched the house shrink in the rearview mirror, the peeling paint, the dead lawn, the rickety blinds. Four hours to Berkeley. Four hours until I could breathe.

When we arrived, my heart began fluttering. I kept fixing my shirt, as if that would stop my hands from shaking. I rushed to unload the car, and as we strolled down the pavement, I froze momentarily. The towering dormitories stood intimidatingly, and when we entered, I was immediately lost. God knows how long until we finally found my dorm, a secluded room in a dark corner.

But when we opened the door, I found something-no, someone-that was sitting on *MY* bed.
