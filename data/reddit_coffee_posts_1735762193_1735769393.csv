Any recommendations? 

I’m not overly concerned with the cost, I just want a solid piece of machinery that would be good for roasting at least 5 pounds (or more) at a time. 

I had started a small coffee roasting business a few years back, loved every second of it, but when I moved out state, it got away from me and I ended up dissolving my LLC to focus on other opportunities. I really miss it, and want to get back into roasting again, but I need something larger than the Behmor home roaster I was using. 

It was great, but if I pick this up again, I need a larger capacity roaster so I don’t have to roast back to back and put the wear on a roaster designed for home use.

##  Revolutionizing Your Mornings: The Ultimate Guide to Alexa Smart Coffee Makers

In today's fast-paced world, convenience is king.  For coffee lovers, that means waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee without the hassle of manual operation.  Enter the Alexa smart coffee maker, a game-changer for those seeking seamless integration of technology and their morning routine. This guide dives deep into the world of voice-controlled coffee brewing, helping you choose the perfect Alexa-compatible machine to automate your mornings and elevate your coffee experience.

## The Allure of Automated Coffee: Benefits of an Alexa Smart Coffee Maker

The appeal of an Alexa smart coffee maker lies in its ability to combine the pleasure of a perfectly brewed cup with the convenience of modern smart home technology.  Let's explore the key advantages:


### **Effortless Voice Control: Your Coffee, Your Voice**

Imagine this: you wake up, still nestled under the covers, and with a simple voice command – """"Alexa, start my coffee"""" – your day begins with the promise of a delicious, freshly brewed cup.  This level of convenience is unmatched.  Voice control extends beyond simply turning the machine on; many models allow you to adjust brew strength (""""Alexa, set my coffee to bold""""), check the brewing status (""""Alexa, is my coffee ready?""""), and even schedule brewing for a specific time.  This eliminates the need for fiddling with buttons and timers, especially beneficial on those sleepy mornings.


### **Smart Home Synergy: Seamless Integration with Your Ecosystem**

Beyond voice control, Alexa smart coffee makers integrate seamlessly with your existing smart home setup.  This means scheduling your brew time through the Alexa app, creating routines that automatically start your coffee maker alongside other morning activities (like turning on the lights or playing your favorite music), and even monitoring energy consumption.  This level of interconnectedness enhances not just your coffee routine, but your entire morning experience.


### **Automated Brewing: Precision and Predictability**

The ability to pre-program your brew time is a game-changer. No more rushing to get your coffee maker started before heading out the door or waking up to a cold, forgotten cup.  With an Alexa smart coffee maker, you can ensure your coffee is ready precisely when you want it, every morning. This consistent, automated brewing guarantees a perfect cup, consistently.


## Addressing Your Morning Coffee Pain Points

Alexa smart coffee makers directly address several common frustrations associated with morning coffee preparation:

### **Goodbye, Manual Hassle:**  The Convenience Factor

The biggest win? Eliminating the manual steps involved in making coffee.  No more fumbling with buttons, measuring grounds, or waiting for the water to heat.  Simply command your coffee maker via Alexa, and let the automation take over. This saves valuable time, especially on busy mornings.

### **Effortless Automation: Schedule Your Perfect Cup**

Scheduling your coffee brew time through the Alexa app is incredibly convenient.  Set it to start brewing before you even wake up, ensuring a hot cup awaits you when you roll out of bed.  This removes the need for manual timing and eliminates the risk of forgetting to start the brewing process.


### **Personalized Perfection: Customization Options**

Most Alexa smart coffee makers offer various customization options.  Adjust the brew strength to your liking, choose from different coffee sizes, or even select a specific brewing temperature – all through voice commands or the Alexa app.  This level of control allows you to personalize your coffee experience to your exact preferences.


## Choosing Your Perfect Alexa Smart Coffee Maker: A Buyer's Guide

Navigating the market of Alexa smart coffee makers requires careful consideration.  Here's a breakdown of key selection criteria:


### **Brand Reputation and Reliability:**  Choosing Quality

Opt for established brands with a proven track record of producing reliable and durable appliances. Look for brands known for their customer service and readily available support documentation. Reading online reviews and checking Amazon ratings can be extremely helpful in assessing a brand's reliability.


### **Essential Features: Functionality Matters**

Beyond basic brewing capabilities, consider these features:

* **Water Reservoir Capacity:**  A larger reservoir means fewer refills.
* **Brewing Options:**  Look for adjustable brew strength, temperature settings, and different cup sizes.
* **Carafe Type:**  A thermal carafe keeps your coffee warmer for longer.
* **Cleaning Cycle:**  Self-cleaning features simplify maintenance.
* **App Integration:**  Ensure seamless integration with the Alexa app and other smart home systems.
* **Safety Features:**  Automatic shutoff is crucial for safety and energy efficiency.


### **Customer Reviews: Real-World Insights**

Before making a purchase, thoroughly review customer feedback on various online platforms, including Amazon, Best Buy, and independent review sites.  Pay close attention to comments regarding reliability, ease of use, and overall customer satisfaction.


## Setting Up Your Alexa Smart Coffee Maker: A Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up your Alexa smart coffee maker is generally straightforward.  However, specific steps may vary depending on the model.  Consult your coffee maker's manual for detailed instructions.


1. **Download the Alexa App:** Download and install the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet.

2. **Connect Your Coffee Maker:**  Follow the app's instructions to connect your coffee maker to your Wi-Fi network.  This usually involves adding the device and entering your Wi-Fi password.

3. **Enable Alexa Skills:**  Some coffee makers require enabling specific Alexa skills to function correctly.  Check your coffee maker's documentation for instructions.

4. **Create Routines:**  Use the Alexa app to create custom routines that automate your coffee brewing process.  For example, you can set a routine to automatically start brewing your coffee at a specific time each morning.

5. **Master Voice Commands:**  Familiarize yourself with the voice commands specific to your coffee maker.  These commands will typically allow you to start brewing, adjust brew strength, check the status, and turn the machine off.


## Top Alexa Smart Coffee Maker Brands: A Comparative Overview

While numerous brands offer Alexa-compatible coffee makers, two stand out for their features and reliability:


### **Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker:** A Reliable Choice

Hamilton Beach offers several models that integrate seamlessly with Alexa.  Key features often include a user-friendly interface, a large water reservoir, a thermal carafe, and automatic shutoff.  Their models are generally praised for their simplicity and reliability.


### **iCoffee Remote Brew:** Advanced Features for the Tech-Savvy

The iCoffee Remote Brew stands out with its built-in grinder, allowing you to grind your beans fresh before brewing.  It also boasts enhanced connectivity, working with not only Alexa but also Google Assistant and other smart home platforms.

1hrdmx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hrdmx6/i_fell_in_love_with_a_woman_a_decade_older_than/,"I fell in love with a woman a decade older than me, an alcoholic and with emotional distance problems, I need opinions (long and intense).","I'm a university student and a writer, and I often go to a somewhat sketchy café where I drink an absurd amount of coffee, write, and try to get inspired as my daily basis. About three months ago, I noticed this incredibly tall, somewhat androgynous woman who caught my attention a lot. The first thing I noticed was how her gestures, mannerisms, and the way she carried herself were very masculine,something that I really liked. I also noticed that she ordered an impressive amount of alcohol lol. Since I'm an extrovert (though I was a bit nervous), I approached her after debating it for about 16 minutes. I told her something that, in hindsight, was pretty stupid: I said I had a character in one of my stories that was basically her, and I explained that I write and go to this café regularly. I said this in a cheerful and concise way. She was already a little tipsy, chuckled, and said she was flattered. I’m pretty sure I blushed a little, but I brushed it off and asked if I could sit with her. She said yes. 

We had a casual conversation. She told me she didn’t go to the café often but came in because she figured they had alcohol. I told her it was a great place, exaggerating a bit to convince her to return. I asked her name, and we talked for almost four hours. When we finished, I offered to drive her home since we’re both women, and it was late. She said she had her car and was fine. To stay in touch, I asked if she planned on coming back and what time she usually did. I told her my usual schedule, and we said goodbye. The following Monday, I arrived around 8:30 PM, and she showed up at 9:00. She sat next to me, and we started talking again. I told her I felt restless sitting for too long and asked if she wanted to go for a walk. 

She agreed, and we strolled around the streets, chatting. This happened repeatedly over the next week—around seven days of us meeting ""accidentally on purpose"" and talking. Then, one day, a friend invited me to a Jewish party (I don’t quite remember the occasion), and I invited her along. I told her she could bring someone else if she wanted and not to worry about it. At the party, there were people our age and older, so it felt pretty normal. We stayed for about two hours before stepping out to talk. I invited her to have dinner at my place, mentioning (falsely) that other friends would be there. We went to my house, and I actually cooked dinner for her. She complimented my cooking and made a flirty joke about traditional roles. Since I live a bit outside the city, it was hard for her to leave so late, so I offered her one of my guest rooms.

 She agreed. I usually wake up at 4:00 AM, so that morning, I did my usual routine, then waited for her to wake up. When she did, I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other at the café, and at some point, as our friendship grew, she asked for my number—not romantically, just because we’d become close. Over the next month, we became ""best friends."" We went out every single day, doing everything together: brunches, picnics, museums, libraries, movies, and more. Everything felt normal until one day I invited her for a sleepover. Knowing she liked alcohol, I bought a lot of whiskey. 

We watched a ton of movies, listened to music, danced, and although I have a pool, only I swam while she smoked from a chair. That night, she got pretty drunk and said a lot of random stuff, also told me she was 30 years old. Based on her appearance, I thought she was around 26 to 28, so it was a bit surprising. I’m 19, but I didn’t think much of it because I’ve always been more mature for my age, due to my high IQ and faster developtment of brain and maturity,so i didn't actually felt the difference even after knowing that and before. 

That night, she also shared other irrelevant things before going to sleep in a small room I have that’s kind of a cute storage space. I brought her a blanket and, playfully, put it over her head. She kept pulling it off, laughing. I did this about four times until, apparently annoyed, she jokingly cursed at me and pulled me onto the bed and roughly kissed me. It’s worth mentioning that I’m a bit short (4’9” and underweight due to anorexia), while she’s 6’0” and much stronger. When she pulled me, I ended up on top of her, but then she flipped us so she was on top. Feeling her weight, I grabbed her arm to signal I wanted to switch positions, so we rolled again. 

This happened a few times until we fell off the bed. Startled, I let out a small scream and got up quickly. She sat up, and since it was so awkward, I just left. I wasn’t drunk, so I went straight to bed. The next morning, everything seemed normal. I assumed she didn’t remember anything because of how much she drank, and since she didn’t bring it up, I didn’t either. I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other, talking, and going out as usual. 

There were days when she opened up about very personal things. One day, she told me about her time in the military, which made a lot of sense considering how physically strong she was—seriously, she was incredibly strong. I’d say our entire relationship was a friendship charged with tension. I divide our time into three phases: the first month, when we met and built trust; the second month, which I just described, where we grew closer and shared deeper conversations (including the kiss incident); and the third month, which I haven’t covered yet—where things escalated due to several factors and a specific situation that frustrated me. In the third month, I realized how much of an alcoholic she was. It didn’t take long to notice, but I didn’t give it much importance (again, lol).

 She would text me while drunk, sending short, often poorly written messages. Since she’s older, her messages were usually either overly brief or laced with irony. Despite this, she was serious in real life and mostly in text conversations. There were days when she bombarded me with messages, saying things like, “Can I go to your house?” or “Can I come over?” or even “I need you.” These texts felt urgent, but by the next day or a few hours later, she’d delete them. Most of the time, I didn’t even see the messages before they disappeared. When I did catch them, she’d act like nothing had happened. This was the biggest issue in our relationship: she’d do things and then brush them off with a casual “Oh, I was drunk.” 

I rarely asked her about it, but when I did, she’d dismiss it completely. This behavior frustrated me immensely. One day, after leaving work, it was raining heavily. I could’ve gone home with one of my theater buddies since they live nearby, but of course, I didn’t (love you know). I’m the only one out who lives far away. Sometimes, I bike home if I’m heading to a friend’s place first and hope they’ll drive me the rest of the way. 

That day, I biked to her apartment and arrived soaking wet. To my surprise, she was very drunk but still recognized me. Here’s where things got intense. Drenched, I expected her to just let me into her apartment. Instead, she told me to take off my wet clothes, saying she’d get me something. She showed me to the bathroom, and I stayed in my underwear because I’m very delicate about that. 

Eventually, she knocked on the door and handed me a leather jacket with a warm lining. Our height difference meant the jacket reached halfway down my thighs. I came out, and she gave me a towel for my hair. Nervously, I told her I just needed to stay a bit and would call a cab. Instead, she picked me up bridal style, took me to her bed, and offered me a beer (lol) but I refused—which later she drank herself. Then, she made me coffee. Sitting beside her in just my underwear and her oversized jacket made me extremely nervous. I tried to keep my distance, but she just looked at me. I’m very insecure and don’t like comments about my appearance, even compliments. She knew this, and despite being drunk, she started talking about my femininity and delicate nature. 

She said I was “dainty” in a way that felt sincere. The way she spoke made me feel so special. I couldn’t believe a drunk person could say such heartfelt things without meaning them. As she talked, she moved closer until she was leaning on my shoulder, smelling me. I wear a lot of perfume daily and use countless scented products. She mentioned this as she leaned in. Then, she slowly unzipped the jacket to my lower abdomen, placed her hands on my ribs, and kissed my neck and torso—never my chest. I’m very sensitive about touch and was initially uncomfortable, but nothing she did felt inappropriate. It was soft, deliberate, and respectful in its own way. Her kisses on my abdomen and ribs made me hyperventilate. For a moment, I almost fainted.

It was like that for a few minutes (probably 8?) but I felt it like hours to me, I was red and I didn't move at any time, not because it made me uncomfortable but on the contrary, no one had made me feel that way and obviously I liked it, a lot to be honest, I didn't like wanted to move at all. it was intimate in a way that made me feel comfortable. Her mouth was a little dry but I could feel her breaths on my abdomen and every kiss she left made me breathe faster, it was so beautiful, just I stayed there looking at her and feeling madly in love, and she just kept leaving kisses all over my body, touching my ribs. I really can't get it out of my head.

Eventually, she picked me up again and left me in her closet with her clothes, telling me to change. I didn’t like it but had no choice. When the rain stopped, she drove me home in her truck, putting my bike in the back. After that, I avoided talking to her for about a week because I was so overwhelmed. She eventually came to my house and stayed over one night. 

The next day, I had invited some elderly women I play tennis with at a club. I told her I was going shopping for the lunch—an excuse because I love shopping. She didn’t bring up what had happened, and I didn’t either. I gave her breakfast and then took her shopping. I bought her high-waisted blue pants, a soft fabric belt, and a loose white silk shirt with buttons. Meanwhile, I bought about seven dresses and several pairs of heels. Later, some elderly ladies mistook her for my boyfriend because of her androgynous style and height.

 That evening, we had a well you know sophisticated dinner. Afterward, we visited a paid-entry garden (capitalism, ugh).And you know, in the car, I didn’t do anything. I just smoked. She obviously noticed, so she asked me about it. I didn’t want to tell her, but she pulled over to the side of the road and confronted me. And I started crying in a millisecond—almost screaming—and told her about it. Not everything I was feeling, but mostly about what she did and how she couldn’t just do that and then ignore it or pretend it didn’t happen. Even though it wasn’t explicit, I basically confessed part of my feelings for her (implicitly because I didn’t told her directly Anything related to romance,but obviously it isn’t normal behavior for a friend). She was shocked, lol. She told me she had been super drunk and didn’t remember anything, saying she was sorry for making me feel that way. 

She insisted it wasn’t her intention and that she didn’t want me to see things the wrong way. She explained that when she’s drunk, she says things randomly without thinking. BUT LIKE, HOW CAN SHE SAY THAT? HOW CAN SHE DO THAT? It HAS to mean something.
 Anyway, after the car incident, we went to the garden, and I calmed down a little. But obviously, I went home completely devastated. I didn’t want to talk to her after that. When I say I didn’t want to talk to her, I mean for a few days. We’re talking normally now, but our ""visits"" have decreased because neither of us brings it up. But,it really bothers me. I think it traumatized me a little. Recently, she’s been texting and calling me a lot, and I don’t know what to do. Oh, and by the way, I know her dad was also an alcoholic and emotionally distant, while her mom was more stable but pretty conservative. So I assume she might be closeted? I don't know but the whole situation is overwhelming me. So Do you think there are real feelings behind it or just confusion and me being delusional? 

I asked my brother (26f) and he told me to just distance myself from her, even though I didn't want to, I told some friends the bad part of our situation and obviously they all hated her and told me to distance myself, which obviously I didn't. No one really understands how much I really WORSHIP her.

This brings me to another point, her social circle is like 10 rude, alcoholic old men that she hangs out with to play pool, while mine is quite huge, and to keep in touch with With all my friends, I normally organized hang outs and events, casual things. But since I met her and we started going out more, I literally forgot about everyone else and I just wanted to be with her all the time, a lot friends thought that she was manipulating me to get me away from everyone else which is completely a lie, it was my own and unconsciously I alone was decreasing my quality time with all my other friends just to be with her.

I literally feel like I can't live without her, she is an immensely important part of my life, I think about her all the time from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep, I don't do my things normally, I am desperate at all times because I want to see her so badly. and I get nervous, when I talk to other people they make me desperate and I can only think about how much I would like to be with her, and despite being someone who is very social I don't feel like meeting someone new.

I am also a very feminine person and I love buy all kinds of clothes, I don't usually wear blue because it is not a color that I like to wear, but since she told me that her favorite color was blue I have about 5 blue dresses, new shoes and especially jewelry, I have even tried to to get her to tell me what kind of smells she likes, what kind of accessories etc etc etc. 

I'm genuinely so in love with her that I can't function properly

Can someone realate or tell me if this woman feels something,ANYHING for me?!?!?!? Any opinions or reccomendations? Because I am going insane.

25 yo male, 5’10, 220 lbs

So I’m going to eat between 2000 a 2200 calories everyday, with that I’ll be having a 500 deficit. 

The diet will be something like this :

Morning: eggs, bread, two fruits, milk, coffee

Lunch: half of the plate with veggies, one tablespoon of olive oil, carbohydrates, lean protein.

Dinner: same that lunch but with less carbs.

Of course it’s mandatory to hit at least 150g of protein, eat all the veggies and all the fruits

In the future I’ll go to train bjj 4 times per week, but I don’t know how  I’ll adjust my diet in that moment.

Also, how I’m going to hit 220 grams of protein with the rule of 1g/lb?, I don’t have money for whey protein, for that reason I just aspire to eat 150 grams

1hrdfvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1hrdfvw/what_i_wish_i_knew_before_traveling_to_rome/,What I wish I knew before traveling to Rome & Florence,"Hi my husband & I just traveled to Rome & Florence for 2 weeks and wanted to share some info for other vegans who may be traveling there in the future. We loved the history & architecture in these cities so the trip was worth it for that alone, but we wouldn't recommend going to these cities if you're specifically looking to try vegan Italian food. We tried both vegan & non-vegan restaurants, local and more-touristy spots too.

Here are some of our takeaways & tips for eating vegan in Rome & Florence:

1. Do not trust Happy Cow reviews ONLY. We usually use Happy Cow wherever we travel to around the world, but Rome & Florence didn't have many options in the first place AND we were sorely disappointed with many of the top-rated vegan/vegetarian restaurants (ex. Nirvana in Florence was *horrible*). We began to search both Happy Cow + Google reviews and found that even a 0.3 point difference in Google review score made a massive difference in quality. To find more non-vegan places with vegan options, just type ""vegan"" into Google maps and you'll see lots of non-vegan restaurants which have vegan options. But again, be weary of reviews and make sure to check the menus ahead of time to ensure you'll have enough options to get enough calories.

2. We didn't realize before we went that usually pastas, proteins, and vegetables are not eaten together in a single dish. Like a pasta doesn't come with many vegetables in it (not even much garlic). So for a complete meal, you should order a main course, second protein, and a side vegetable dish/salad to get more nutrients and enough calories. We also recommend eating fruit bowls (usually available at coffee/cafe places) for more nutrients and tofu/seitan whenever possible for protein.

3. Italian food is focused on the ""true flavor"" of the ingredients so they barely use spices. And if you're eating mainly vegan food, this limits the ingredients list even more. If you're Asian, this might affect you more because the lack of spices/added flavor is not what you're used to. Our tip would be to bring a mini travel bottle of Tabasco, salt, and pepper packets with you (or ask for it at the restaurant because we saw Tabasco everywhere). Also visit Indian restaurants if you're craving some different types of carbs (e.g. rice) or amped up flavor.

4. If you're allergic to sesame, beware that a lot of non-vegan restaurants have hummus or something with hummus as their only vegan option (hummus has tahini which is a creamy sauce made of ground sesame seeds). Even a lot of vegan restaurants use a lot of tahini or sesame seeds in their dishes, so make sure you check the menus and then ask the waiters and clarify your allergy!

Some good restaurants we tried in Rome & Florence:

\- Rome: Rifugio Romano, Il Margueta, Saravana Bhavaan, Vega Food

\- Florence: Tripperia Vegana TAN8, Santo Falafel, Edoardo for gelato",12,1735768021.0,vegan,1,1.0,False

Me and my boyfriend are both autistic guys (I'm a trans guy, important later) and 16 and idk our relationship is pretty strained right now. I really don't know what to do about it.

We're both 16 and it was our first Christmas together, right? And I love giving gifts and receiving them, even if I don't know how to react sometimes, because it shows how much people care for eachother. I've been given some really sweet gifts this year that mean a lot to me since it's my first Christmas in a new friend group since I moved schools 2023 and only properly became friends with these people in January of 2024. Like my friend gave me an enamel pin for my hyperfixation and I LOVE it, and another friend gave me the Mr. X Resident Evil duck bc it's an inside joke since he gave me Leon for my birthday.

But, my boyfriend goes to another school, I was just saying the friend stuff to preface that generally, I'm a very appreciative guy when it comes to presents. I love giving and getting them, they're so sweet and heartfelt.

I got my boyfriend a pair of converse since I know he loves converse, and his were falling apart. I'm planning on painting them at some point, doing that thing that makes them look cartoony, yknow? And I slid a little handwritten note into the box about how much I love him and how it's our first Christmas together.

I despise surprises, and he knows this so we agreed to tell eachother the basic premise of what we were getting eachother. So I tell him the shoes and he tells me about how he's getting me posters bc I have empty frames and it's stressing me out to get some for them. Which is sweet, right?

But it was just...I dunno, all wrong? He gave me a really bored look and went ""You like that...dear Evan Hansen musical, right? That's your favourite, I know that. I don't remember what else you like, what other ones would you want?""

That struck me as weird, yknow that he didn't know my interests. Especially since my hyperfixation rn is my favourite musical and I've been talking about it for months on end, and it's not DEH. But I brushed it off and was like ""oh, I dunno, video game ones I guess.""

The posters are lovely and I love them! I know this is very ""worlds smallest violin"", but I promise it gets somewhere. It's the necklace he got me.

Don't get me wrong, I love jewellery. I tell him all the time how I love jewellery! I only wear silver jewellery and I have a very specific style, since I mainly dress very...I dunno, Midwest emo? Also I am not a fan of necklaces, whenever he hints at jewellery I always go ""well, yknow, sensory issues. I like earrings!""

But he sends me a photo once it arrives, and it's...really not my style. It's a gold colour, which yknow, and it's this big chunky pendant with three charms rattling inside it. Like in a plastic bit, all loose pieces. My initial, which was ironic since I'd just went on a rant about how I hate jewellery with initials or names, a rainbow hear and a coffee cup.

None of these things are my style. I was staring at it and all I could think to say was ""yay"". Like this is all things I don't like, and it's not my style, and it's feminine, and it seems like a gift he thought I would like because he wanted me to like it.

And I just keep worrying about this. About everything! I fucking hate this gift, I really do, and I don't know how to tell him. I feel awful because I know he was being nice and I can't be mean! But ugh I hate it. And I keep thinking about the other problems in the relationship. Like how he keeps calling me ""she"" and ""her"" and ""miss"" and I think he's stopped viewing me as a guy. And how he's gotten so clingy I feel like I'm drowning and he keeps crossing little boundaries, like touching me when I'm overstimulated or making me feel so guilty for being ""weird"" when I unmask that I instantly go back.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend got me a gift I would never in a million years like, and I don't know how to say I don't like it. It's made me rethink the relationship because it seems like something I wouldn't ever really like, and I keep thinking about other stuff he's done to make me doubt ""us"" and I feel like an asshole.

Hey everyone, 

I’m looking for a potential diet plan to try out for weight loss. I am 29 (M), currently 190lbs and my ideal weight is 165-170lbs. 

Two years ago I got down to 166lbs. I accomplished that by doing 75 Hard. No alcohol, sugar, two work outs a day. However I’ve gained it back and the holidays certainly didn’t help. 

Would love to drop 20-25lbs in 3-4 months. I workout five times a week. Three of my five workouts weekly I run 4.5 miles. The other two workouts I do 30 mins of cycling and 30 mins of weight lifting. 

The root of my problem is calorie control. I eat healthily for most meals but I eat high volume. Also I have an ice cream weakness. Not every week but probably twice a month I’ll kill a pint in one sitting. 

I usually don’t eat anything for breakfast but black coffee and water. My calories come mainly in for lunch and dinner. I try to keep it under 2,000 but often fail. Also when it comes to alcoholic beverages I mainly only drink on weekends but thinking I will cut it out completely until May this hasn’t been a problem for me in the past. 

I was thinking about trying a keto diet but would be open to other options. Does any one have a diet plan they tried that worked for weight loss. ",1,1735767734.0,diet,1,1.0,False

Opinions? Is she the asshole? Urgent help","I'm a university student and a writer, and I often go to a somewhat sketchy café where I drink an absurd amount of coffee, write, and try to get inspired as my daily basis. About three months ago, I noticed this incredibly tall, somewhat androgynous woman who caught my attention a lot. The first thing I noticed was how her gestures, mannerisms, and the way she carried herself were very masculine,something that I really liked. I also noticed that she ordered an impressive amount of alcohol lol. Since I'm an extrovert (though I was a bit nervous), I approached her after debating it for about 16 minutes. I told her something that, in hindsight, was pretty stupid: I said I had a character in one of my stories that was basically her, and I explained that I write and go to this café regularly. I said this in a cheerful and concise way. She was already a little tipsy, chuckled, and said she was flattered. I’m pretty sure I blushed a little, but I brushed it off and asked if I could sit with her. She said yes. 

We had a casual conversation. She told me she didn’t go to the café often but came in because she figured they had alcohol. I told her it was a great place, exaggerating a bit to convince her to return. I asked her name, and we talked for almost four hours. When we finished, I offered to drive her home since we’re both women, and it was late. She said she had her car and was fine. To stay in touch, I asked if she planned on coming back and what time she usually did. I told her my usual schedule, and we said goodbye. The following Monday, I arrived around 8:30 PM, and she showed up at 9:00. She sat next to me, and we started talking again. I told her I felt restless sitting for too long and asked if she wanted to go for a walk. 

She agreed, and we strolled around the streets, chatting. This happened repeatedly over the next week—around seven days of us meeting ""accidentally on purpose"" and talking. Then, one day, a friend invited me to a Jewish party (I don’t quite remember the occasion), and I invited her along. I told her she could bring someone else if she wanted and not to worry about it. At the party, there were people our age and older, so it felt pretty normal. We stayed for about two hours before stepping out to talk. I invited her to have dinner at my place, mentioning (falsely) that other friends would be there. We went to my house, and I actually cooked dinner for her. She complimented my cooking and made a flirty joke about traditional roles. Since I live a bit outside the city, it was hard for her to leave so late, so I offered her one of my guest rooms.

 She agreed. I usually wake up at 4:00 AM, so that morning, I did my usual routine, then waited for her to wake up. When she did, I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other at the café, and at some point, as our friendship grew, she asked for my number—not romantically, just because we’d become close. Over the next month, we became ""best friends."" We went out every single day, doing everything together: brunches, picnics, museums, libraries, movies, and more. Everything felt normal until one day I invited her for a sleepover. Knowing she liked alcohol, I bought a lot of whiskey. 

We watched a ton of movies, listened to music, danced, and although I have a pool, only I swam while she smoked from a chair. That night, she got pretty drunk and said a lot of random stuff, also told me she was 30 years old. Based on her appearance, I thought she was around 26 to 28, so it was a bit surprising. I’m 19, but I didn’t think much of it because I’ve always been more mature for my age, due to my high IQ and faster developtment of brain and maturity,so i didn't actually felt the difference even after knowing that and before. 

That night, she also shared other irrelevant things before going to sleep in a small room I have that’s kind of a cute storage space. I brought her a blanket and, playfully, put it over her head. She kept pulling it off, laughing. I did this about four times until, apparently annoyed, she jokingly cursed at me and pulled me onto the bed and roughly kissed me. It’s worth mentioning that I’m a bit short (4’9” and underweight due to anorexia), while she’s 6’0” and much stronger. When she pulled me, I ended up on top of her, but then she flipped us so she was on top. Feeling her weight, I grabbed her arm to signal I wanted to switch positions, so we rolled again. 

This happened a few times until we fell off the bed. Startled, I let out a small scream and got up quickly. She sat up, and since it was so awkward, I just left. I wasn’t drunk, so I went straight to bed. The next morning, everything seemed normal. I assumed she didn’t remember anything because of how much she drank, and since she didn’t bring it up, I didn’t either. I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other, talking, and going out as usual. 

There were days when she opened up about very personal things. One day, she told me about her time in the military, which made a lot of sense considering how physically strong she was—seriously, she was incredibly strong. I’d say our entire relationship was a friendship charged with tension. I divide our time into three phases: the first month, when we met and built trust; the second month, which I just described, where we grew closer and shared deeper conversations (including the kiss incident); and the third month, which I haven’t covered yet—where things escalated due to several factors and a specific situation that frustrated me. In the third month, I realized how much of an alcoholic she was. It didn’t take long to notice, but I didn’t give it much importance (again, lol).

 She would text me while drunk, sending short, often poorly written messages. Since she’s older, her messages were usually either overly brief or laced with irony. Despite this, she was serious in real life and mostly in text conversations. There were days when she bombarded me with messages, saying things like, “Can I go to your house?” or “Can I come over?” or even “I need you.” These texts felt urgent, but by the next day or a few hours later, she’d delete them. Most of the time, I didn’t even see the messages before they disappeared. When I did catch them, she’d act like nothing had happened. This was the biggest issue in our relationship: she’d do things and then brush them off with a casual “Oh, I was drunk.” 

I rarely asked her about it, but when I did, she’d dismiss it completely. This behavior frustrated me immensely. One day, after leaving work, it was raining heavily. I could’ve gone home with one of my theater buddies since they live nearby, but of course, I didn’t (love you know). I’m the only one out who lives far away. Sometimes, I bike home if I’m heading to a friend’s place first and hope they’ll drive me the rest of the way. 

That day, I biked to her apartment and arrived soaking wet. To my surprise, she was very drunk but still recognized me. Here’s where things got intense. Drenched, I expected her to just let me into her apartment. Instead, she told me to take off my wet clothes, saying she’d get me something. She showed me to the bathroom, and I stayed in my underwear because I’m very delicate about that. 

Eventually, she knocked on the door and handed me a leather jacket with a warm lining. Our height difference meant the jacket reached halfway down my thighs. I came out, and she gave me a towel for my hair. Nervously, I told her I just needed to stay a bit and would call a cab. Instead, she picked me up bridal style, took me to her bed, and offered me a beer (lol) but I refused—which later she drank herself. Then, she made me coffee. Sitting beside her in just my underwear and her oversized jacket made me extremely nervous. I tried to keep my distance, but she just looked at me. I’m very insecure and don’t like comments about my appearance, even compliments. She knew this, and despite being drunk, she started talking about my femininity and delicate nature. 

She said I was “dainty” in a way that felt sincere. The way she spoke made me feel so special. I couldn’t believe a drunk person could say such heartfelt things without meaning them. As she talked, she moved closer until she was leaning on my shoulder, smelling me. I wear a lot of perfume daily and use countless scented products. She mentioned this as she leaned in. Then, she slowly unzipped the jacket to my lower abdomen, placed her hands on my ribs, and kissed my neck and torso—never my chest. I’m very sensitive about touch and was initially uncomfortable, but nothing she did felt inappropriate. It was soft, deliberate, and respectful in its own way. Her kisses on my abdomen and ribs made me hyperventilate. For a moment, I almost fainted.

It was like that for a few minutes (probably 8?) but I felt it like hours to me, I was red and I didn't move at any time, not because it made me uncomfortable but on the contrary, no one had made me feel that way and obviously I liked it, a lot to be honest, I didn't like wanted to move at all. it was intimate in a way that made me feel comfortable. Her mouth was a little dry but I could feel her breaths on my abdomen and every kiss she left made me breathe faster, it was so beautiful, just I stayed there looking at her and feeling madly in love, and she just kept leaving kisses all over my body, touching my ribs. I really can't get it out of my head.

Eventually, she picked me up again and left me in her closet with her clothes, telling me to change. I didn’t like it but had no choice. When the rain stopped, she drove me home in her truck, putting my bike in the back. After that, I avoided talking to her for about a week because I was so overwhelmed. She eventually came to my house and stayed over one night. 

The next day, I had invited some elderly women I play tennis with at a club. I told her I was going shopping for the lunch—an excuse because I love shopping. She didn’t bring up what had happened, and I didn’t either. I gave her breakfast and then took her shopping. I bought her high-waisted blue pants, a soft fabric belt, and a loose white silk shirt with buttons. Meanwhile, I bought about seven dresses and several pairs of heels. Later, some elderly ladies mistook her for my boyfriend because of her androgynous style and height.

 That evening, we had a well you know sophisticated dinner. Afterward, we visited a paid-entry garden (capitalism, ugh).And you know, in the car, I didn’t do anything. I just smoked. She obviously noticed, so she asked me about it. I didn’t want to tell her, but she pulled over to the side of the road and confronted me. And I started crying in a millisecond—almost screaming—and told her about it. Not everything I was feeling, but mostly about what she did and how she couldn’t just do that and then ignore it or pretend it didn’t happen. Even though it wasn’t explicit, I basically confessed part of my feelings for her (implicitly because I didn’t told her directly Anything related to romance,but obviously it isn’t normal behavior for a friend). She was shocked, lol. She told me she had been super drunk and didn’t remember anything, saying she was sorry for making me feel that way. 

She insisted it wasn’t her intention and that she didn’t want me to see things the wrong way. She explained that when she’s drunk, she says things randomly without thinking. BUT LIKE, HOW CAN SHE SAY THAT? HOW CAN SHE DO THAT? It HAS to mean something.
 Anyway, after the car incident, we went to the garden, and I calmed down a little. But obviously, I went home completely devastated. I didn’t want to talk to her after that. When I say I didn’t want to talk to her, I mean for a few days. We’re talking normally now, but our ""visits"" have decreased because neither of us brings it up. But,it really bothers me. I think it traumatized me a little. Recently, she’s been texting and calling me a lot, and I don’t know what to do. Oh, and by the way, I know her dad was also an alcoholic and emotionally distant, while her mom was more stable but pretty conservative. So I assume she might be closeted? I don't know but the whole situation is overwhelming me. So Do you think there are real feelings behind it or just confusion and me being delusional? 

I asked my brother (26f) and he told me to just distance myself from her, even though I didn't want to, I told some friends the bad part of our situation and obviously they all hated her and told me to distance myself, which obviously I didn't. No one really understands how much I really WORSHIP her.

This brings me to another point, her social circle is like 10 rude, alcoholic old men that she hangs out with to play pool, while mine is quite huge, and to keep in touch with With all my friends, I normally organized hang outs and events, casual things. But since I met her and we started going out more, I literally forgot about everyone else and I just wanted to be with her all the time, a lot friends thought that she was manipulating me to get me away from everyone else which is completely a lie, it was my own and unconsciously I alone was decreasing my quality time with all my other friends just to be with her.

I literally feel like I can't live without her, she is an immensely important part of my life, I think about her all the time from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep, I don't do my things normally, I am desperate at all times because I want to see her so badly. and I get nervous, when I talk to other people they make me desperate and I can only think about how much I would like to be with her, and despite being someone who is very social I don't feel like meeting someone new.

I am also a very feminine person and I love buy all kinds of clothes, I don't usually wear blue because it is not a color that I like to wear, but since she told me that her favorite color was blue I have about 5 blue dresses, new shoes and especially jewelry, I have even tried to to get her to tell me what kind of smells she likes, what kind of accessories etc etc etc. 

I'm genuinely so in love with her that I can't function properly

basically, when i was taking a web design class in high school, my teacher made us write an essay arguing whether or not ai art should be considered art. i remember having a helluva hard time finding mainstream/professional sources talking about it in general. naturally i just assumed it was because sites like midjourney were still in their infancy.

anyway, the reason why i wrote that whole paragraph is because after seeing that ""nobody likes ai"" pic for the 15th time in blusky, it reminded me of that essay i did in web design. i keep seeing ""stop putting ai in everything"" and ""nobody even likes ai"" in places where the majority of people are anti ai, but not nearly as much anywhere else.

i mean, yeah, its probably not a smart idea to base all my opinions on a few posts on SlightlyLessRacistTwitter™ in the first place, but if the claim that ""nobody likes ai"" is even remotely true, youd expect at lot more companies that aren't tech centered to express their distaste of ai.

im not saying starbucks should change their name to ""We Dont Use Ai To Make Our Coffee Also Our Decaf Is The Worst Fucking Thing You'll Ever Taste"", but id expect them to make their stance clear if nobody actually likes ai. but they dont, because ai and tech arent their forte, so why should they give a shit?

to me, the claim that ai is hated upon by all is just a delusion created by the more extreme ai haters in an attempt to goad themselves into thinking they're the good guys in this whole debacle. but in reality, most people/companies couldn't care less because they have more important crap to worry about.

I would get no support; and they would purposely try to trigger my paranoia. They would constantly humiliate me, forcing me to go out in sexual clothes starting at 9 and i was forced to be the male carer’s type. Bodyshamed too, i was too skinny or obese. i would be suffocated and hit, and used to have pins in my kneecaps too. my social workers knew this was happening, but couldnt take me out of placement because i thought it was normal, and wanted to be there. there were other children there, and one foster kid who assaulted me. in short afterwards he told my friends i lied about it and he got them to stab me. i got expelled. i then told my friends at a different school about what my carers would do as punishments, and they told my social workers and they moved me on the day to live with someone called Nikki. she was nice at first, but her children were liars. i had voice messages of her telling me to cut myself because i look “hot when im in blood” and she forced a razor onto my arm which led me to go to hospital for potential artery damage. my mother last year, so she took me to live with her. that was fun and what id always wanted until she cracked. she broke my walls and door, and threatened to f*ck my pzzy with a knife. she stabbed me. i didnt get believed because i have a record of many suicide attempts, i begged for months and they got me out. i lived with my friends for a few months until they found somewhere good for me to live. it seemed perfect. id just come out of being micromanaged, and these guys were super loose with plans and let me do whatever. i thought that was good. ny social workers was worried because they wouldnt do anything for me. no food or help cleaning, no doctors or hospital appointments, nothing. i thought it was fine, until the (70year old) male foster carer started to make advances on me. and i realised maggots beinf everywhere isnt normal. flies everywhere arent normal. him talking about sex all the time to me at 15 wasnt normal.  i had proof, i showed it and they moved me out immediately. i now live in a psychiatric foster home, and im faced with all of my issues. people keep telling me im traumatised but it doesnt feel like that. i mean i know im traumatised but i tell myself im not crying or shaking all rhe time so i must be fine; but i seriously am crying all the time

We got home and boom, instant headache. I layed down for a little bit and took some Excederin (headache meds) and after about 45 mins i was feeling better and everything was okay. About an hour later me and her decided to have intercourse and not even 15 mins in i felt so fatigued and then the headache came back and we had to stop. I felt horrible again so i took another headache med and took another nap. I woke up feeling meh and me and her decided to watch tv for a little. During then, i started to feel FREEZING. We turned the fans off and she felt hot but i was ice cold. Finally, my temperature went back to normal and i took her home.

Actual post:

I went for a run to a Target to pick up an order today. After picking up my stuff, I stopped by their starbucks to get an after-run coffee. I asked for just a single shot of espresso, and was about to pay w my phone, when she said something like it's okay, i got you, and didn't ring me up, just got me my single shot.

Asked if she was sure, and she was. And since I was tired from my run and I don't like questioning too much people who are kind or generous to me, I just thanked her, and left.

Questions, thoughts:

Have you ever let baristas/bartenders/etc. buy a coffee/drink/etc. for you? Why, why not? 

Reminds me of people buying drinks, coffees for friends, but also guys getting girls coffees on dates. Was she doing the reverse? Also reminds me of people “fighting” to pay the bill. Would offering to get her something in return be a cool thing to do? But we’re literal strangers..? And idk how starbucks policy works, but at the cafe I used to work at, employee's got whatever drinks they wanted anyways.

If you ever were working and got a customer something “on the house”, why?

Would she get in trouble or is she taking the 1.75 out of her tips?

1hrctni,https://www.reddit.com/r/PvZHeroes/comments/1hrctni/mustache_waxer_is_the_worst_designed_card_in_the/,Mustache Waxer is the worst designed card in the game and I can prove it.,"What’s going on everybody, this is not Fry, but Trybel. New balance changes have come and gone and for the most part they’re alright. Some nerfs that I don’t agree with, some buffs that didn’t do enough, and some cards that really needed to be touched but didn’t, but the game got a new batch of paint, which is great! Except it isn’t. You see, one of my biggest pet peeves in the game is specifically Mustache Waxer, and I fully believe it is the worst designed card in the game from every possible standpoint, then it got \*buffed\*. Let me tell you why I think this.

Before I get into the specifics, I should tell you about the history of the Mustache tribe in general. Mustaches had 0 synergy throughout the first set - Premium, and was completely a cosmetic tribe. Think like the Dragon, Banana (before Half-Banana and Banana Peel), Pepper, Garbage, or Clock tribes, if you can remember some of those. There were so few that I can list them all right here: Pool Shark, Zombot Drone Engineer, Electrician, Gentleman Zombie, Portal Technician, Shieldcrusher Viking, Wizard Gargantuar, Backup Dancer, Bungee Plumber, Abracadaver, Landscaper, Zombie Coach, Zombie King, Coffee Zombie, Headstone Carver, and Mixed-Up Gravedigger. You can see that none of them have anything in common with each other, and definitely no Mustache Synergy.

Mustaches would get two things that actually utilized the tribe afterwards. The first was Impostor, which gave a mustache to the Imp it conjured, or back in those days “added to your hand”. It was completely cosmetic, but did change its tribing. The second was Frosty Mustache. I will never understand the devs’ obsession with conjure, and I feel like I can just attribute this card to being a joke, given the flavor text being “So cool!”. Regardless, it only gave you a mustache card, and isn’t really considered synergy. 

Now, what is the problem here? Well, mustaches are completely cosmetic. I’ll use another tribe as an example - Mushrooms. Mushrooms tend to be very swarmy and small, being weak to AOE removal. You can look at cards such as Poison Mushroom, Shroom For Two, and Mushroom ringleader to see that they want to swarm the board early and are very fragile. There are some outliers in every tribe, notably in the Mushroom tribe is Toadstool and Smoosh-Shroom, which both cost more than 5 and don’t synergize at all, but again, this is common with every tribe because every unit must have at least one tribe. You can always see a consistent strategy with each tribe. Nuts are high on health, Smackadamia buffs them and Mirror Nut converts being hurt into damage. Pets swarm wide and very fast. Imps are great as fodder due to Toxic Waste Imp and Imp Commander turning each one into a threat. Peas want to grow very tall using Podfather and Torchwood.

On the other hand, Mustaches have no clear synergy with each other. The only similarity some cards have flavorwise is the Mustache, but they are given the same tribe regardless. There is nothing in common with essentially any two mustache cards in terms of design. This would be fine, in my opinion, if it was completely cosmetic or was strictly relegated to Conjures. 

Triassic Triumph would change this, adding Duckstache and Mustache Waxer. I’ll talk about Duckstache first, which I definitely think is the lesser of the offenders by a mile. Duckstache also conjures Mustaches and uses Mustaches as evolution fodder to buff itself. While I don’t like it having synergy with something completely cosmetic, Evolution as a whole already encourages you to build around smaller units to evolve these bigger ones off of, so you will naturally lean towards the lower cost units. 

Mustache Waxer not only is low cost, providing good fodder for Duckstache, but also doesn’t provide anything to the board with its synergy other than snowballing its health. But the devs decided to instead make its tribal synergy a mana cheat - the thing that you absolutely should not give anything without heavy consideration on how it can be used - made only even worse by the fact that it snowballs its health, making it extremely difficult to remove for a 1 mana unit. A completely cosmetic tribe given a mana cheat and a health snowball, making it arguably the best synergy card in the game had it not been for the relative lack of Brainy mustaches and only really run on PB in a competitive capacity. It is still infuriating to play against either IM, SB, or HG when they highroll this card with Cheese Cutters or Impostors, though.

The next part is pretty subjective and honestly, it's just me ranting. I already was angry at this fact before the patch for at least a year during a break I took. Then they decided to \*buff\* this card, giving it even more survivability. The worst designed card in the game in my opinion, and they decided to buff it without fixing its issues. You can’t even attribute this to a bug like Quarterly Bonus or forgetting to implement a change like Transfiguration. This was 100% intentional, despite it heavily going against almost every card game design principle I know of.

Anyway, rant over. TLDR, Mustache Waxer took a completely cosmetic tribe and gave it a synergy without considering the units that would receive that synergy, and the synergy it got was a mana cheat while buffing its own survivability to get more of said mana cheat.",6,1735766393.0,PvZHeroes,1,1.0,False

I have three children under the age of 12. I have one rental property being built, I’m not entirely sure if the apartment should be sold or rented out yet. I have enough coming in to support my kids and I, after a couple of months of saving I’ve managed to secure 5000 dollars for emergency savings (that will steadily grow, I have a goal to have 15 by the end of 2025) and I have 5000 dollars in another savings account that I want to invest with. Prior to my husband’s death, I’ve never worked or had my own money, banked. Nothing. I’m in a tax free country, so the money is just sitting there in the bank. I read something about how the rich are rich because their money doesn’t equal hours worked, they’re rich because of investments and passive income. I am extremely serious and working very hard to save as much as I can for ten years so distribute between my kids for their futures and my retirement (since I was a SAHM and I have a huge gap in my CV). I’m not really asking how to save more, mainly wondering what’s the best way to invest this 5000 I’ve saved and how to continue to grow that investment. Thank you! 

Yes I know for some 5000 emergency savings doesn’t seem like a lot but I don’t pay rent, I don’t pay for healthcare, I don’t pay for education, I don’t pay taxes. 15000 could rent me an apartment here for six months, it’s enough to start over if I had to. I plan to have 50 000 in savings in 10 years at least. 

The investment money I put aside was really difficult to secure, I cut out my coffee and eating out entirely for a few months to save that up specifically for this purpose. 

I’ll also add:
I’m completely debt free and plan to remain debt free.
I don’t work regularly, I’m a freelancer so that’s why I want to invest the money before I spend it on something silly, my income is seasonal and spotty at best right now.
My current husband and I keep our assets and accounts separate (I’m recovering from financial abuse unfortunately, but he’s a great provider and very understanding and knows where my money is going: to the kids).

So now I feel pretty embarrassed if I walk into confession every time I fall and confess the same sin. It’s like walking into a coffee shop and the server sees you and says “ would you like your usual?”

He invited them to stay with us for 14days which I personally thought was a bit too long but didn’t say anything as they already booked their flight tickets. 

His mom had a brain aneurysm the previous summer and she has to use a stick to help her walk, she’s a large woman too so it can take her a while to do simple tasks like go upstairs to go to the bathroom etc. we accommodated as best we could making sure that there was a chair big enough for her to sit in and that she could get around the house without having to squeeze past furniture. 

After the forth day they were starting to get on my nerves due to side comments about things I couldn’t control, it’s cold outside, why don’t you have a downstairs bathroom, it’s raining again, it be nice if you had a bigger house. She’s German so she has to moan about something plus it’s not helped that whenever she has a conversation it’s always in German, I understand a little but not enough to indulge in full conversation so I’m pretty much pushed out the chat.

Being in the armed forces I don’t get to pick the size of the house and she knows this as my father-in-law is ex military. 

My partner had to go into the office for a few hours and we had to get a few things from the supper market for New Years Eve, I decided since the weather wasn’t that bad we’d stay out for a few hours and grab a coffee, sit down and watch the world go by for a bit.

In the evening we went out for a meal but it wasn’t that great but I still got to know about, I drove everyone home after about a 10min drive back to camp, we put a movie on to kill some time before midnight and I put on the dishwasher in the kitchen as I forgot to before we left earlier to clean some glasses etc. I didn’t think it was that big a deal and wasn’t being overly loud. While watching the movie people are drinking and getting into the New Years spirit. As the night continued voices were getting louder and I was struggling to hear the TV, I said in not a rude way to end the conversation I’m trying to watch this.

In a fit of rage both my in-laws started shouting about how rude we’ve been and that I was being a terrible host because my Mother-in-law had been struggling to hear the tv too but couldn’t because of the dishwasher in the kitchen but at no point asked for the TV volume to turned up, she then started yelling that she hadn’t eaten all day because of me. When I asked her why didn’t you say anything she replied with I dropped hints.

I told her to be an adult and speak up, I can’t fix problems if I’m not told about them, my father-in-law started yelling not to speak to his wife like that and stormed off upstairs. She then switched back to me explaining that during parties people don’t put machines on in the kitchen, I said this is my house and I’ll do what I please, I also said I was fed up that I was being shut out of conversations and that it was rude of her not to include me into them, epically when sat at the dinner table, she then switched onto my partner (her son) and started yelling at him about she is his mother and started guilt tripping him about how she raised him and that he now owes her 40k for a car she paid off when he was 18. They then yelled in German and she slapped him…hard across the face.

I told them they’ve both outstayed their welcome and that they can leave as soon as possible. My father-in-law tried to bait me into a fight knowing I’d get in trouble if I knocked a 67 year old to the ground.

A few hours go by and everyone has calmed down and everyone begrudgingly cheered the new year in at midnight.

I spoke to my partner the next morning half praying that they had left and gone to the airport but was not that lucky. To keep the peace my partner wants to act likes nothing happened but I don’t forgive and forget that quickly, I now spend as much time as possible avoiding them which is hard to do in a small house, my only alone time where I’m not bothered by them is when I’m in the bathroom or taking the dog out for extra long walks. 

I’ve now got these two horrible people in my house for another four days that I want nothing to do with, they have trouble with their relationship with their daughter and other son-in-law. I’m in no way preventing my husband from seeing his family but I definitely don’t want to see them again I’ve had enough drama with some of my relatives and find it a lot easier just to cut them out.

Apologies for the long rant but I needed to vent somewhere.

1hrcjfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCSP/comments/1hrcjfs/passed_ccsp/,Passed CCSP,"Thank you so much to this Reddit community for all the suggestions and guidance. I got to know about the required resources and materials through this platform. 

I have 7+ years of experience in IT Security including cloud. The first part of the exam was challenging, it was a battle between 2 answers which were almost similar. The remaining part of the exam was mostly direct questions. Specifically, I was facing problems on time management because the first 40 to 50 questions took most of the exam time and I got only 1 hour for the remaining. Thankfulky, those last questions were direct and I was able to manage them.

Here are the resources I used:

1. Official Study Guide 3rd Edition
2. CBK Reference 4th Edition + Handwritten notes which I had taken 
3. Gwen Betty's Udemy videos and YouTube video ""How to think like a manager?""
4. Skimmed through Destination Cert's summary which is available for free online
5. Pete Zerger's YouTube video 
6. Prabhu Nair's coffee shot

Practice Exams 
1. Official Practice exam both version 2 and 3. Got average score of 78
2. Pocket prep exam questions  - 5/10 ( the questions gave me understandings on topics and they were very tricky). Was getting around 75 to 80
3. Certprep (free resource) - I found this very similar to the actual exam, I felt the first exam which I took was very hard and the remaining I think I got an understanding about the question format and was able to handle it. Got between 75 to 80 
4. Learnzapp - Not even near to the actual exam but can be used for understanding basic terms and concepts in case if you need to handle the direct questions.

Overall it was a very tough path, I nearly prepared for this exam for 6 months since I had a lot of deadlines on my work as well.

All the best to the future test takers!!!",7,1735765620.0,CCSP,1,1.0,False

If something embarrassing is going to happen, I'm going to be the one it happens to. One year at summer camp (high school aged) when they had us sifting through a kiddie pool full of mayonnaise and swishy nastiness to find puzzle pieces, several people were gagging. But I just had to be the one who actually threw up. They had to stop everything because it was a biohazard, they made a big deal out of it, and gave my team points with much fan fair. I wanted to disappear forever. 

When I was 15, I was part of a puppetry team preparing for a national competition (yes, I'm a nerd/dork/whatever other thing they call uncool people). We were all sat around the living room listening to the song and practicing when to hold up certain signs, scenery, and puppets. We're all doing the same motion of basically punching the air enthusiastically, but of course I was the only one with a lamp above her head. So I accidentally punched the lamp shade and broke the light bulb. Everyone was mad at me, but I didn't do anything different from the rest.

When I was 18, we had a missionary visit my church and take part in our volleyball night. He was on my team, and we were having a grand old time. At one point the ball was coming right towards me, but the missionary yelled, ""mine!"" and started towards it. I panicked and couldn't get out of the way, so instead, I ducked. He, of course ran into me, flipped over me, and landed in a heap on top of me. It was funny and his fault, but how was I, once again, at the center of whatever went wrong?!

My church has a picnic Sunday every year, and the summer I was 25, we had an obstacle course set up. Part of the course was to crawl under some logs or something on our stomachs like soldiers. All the kids and young adults did it, and we were all in bathing suits. Even some people 50 and over did the obstacle course. The pastor filmed the whole thing. Of course, I has one who had to have a whole boob fall out at the first log, and I had to crawl all the way through trying to cover it before I could actually stand up and adjust myself. They all tried to comfort me, and the pastor assured me he stopped filming when it happened and would edit out anything untoward. I wanted the nearby river to carry off to some rapids and put me out of my misery.

These are just some examples. Many many more exist, but last night was the last straw. I was at my church's New Years Eve party, and we were playing a game of fish bowl, which is similar to charades. One of my teammates, a very quirk little man in his early 70s, was trying to act out ""chimney sweep."" It looked like he was alternating between an incredibly poor imitation of some sort of South Asian snake dance and counting links an a chain suspended from the ceiling. Everyone was howling with laughter. No one could speak. My good friend and I were holding on to each other for support. Then suddenly it happened. I felt myself start to pee a little. In a desperate bid to not pee on the pastor's wife's couch, I jumped up and started for the bathroom. I immediately kicked/tripped over the coffee table, landing on the floor, and spilling water over my self. Being in a panic, I interpreted this wetness as pee and started speed crawling for the bathroom. I managed to get up and run the rest of the way, but then, of course I was stuck in the bathroom covered in (what I thought was) pee. I had to call for help, borrow a new set of clothes, and somehow preserve my dignity as I rejoined the party. I'm happy I didn't actually pee myself, but everyone thought I did. I couldn't explain without it being more awkward. Everyone was very kind, and the game was declared over. I sat on the couch and fought tears.

I'm just so tired. I'm not doing anything over the top. I'm not trying to stick out or be dramatic. But I do. And I am. How do I stop this from happening? Why can't I just be like everyone else. Why can't I throw my first in the air, crawl on my belly, or laugh at charades without creating a disaster and ruining the fun. People are either angry or sympathetic, but either way, the fun is over, and it's my fault. Why?! It doesn't feel fair, and I'm so so very tired.",3,1735765379.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

The History and Evolution of Eight O'Clock Coffee Brand
-------------------------------------------------------

The rich journey of Eight O'Clock Coffee began in the 1850s, rooted in the passion of its founder, a German immigrant named Joseph S. Hinkle. He established the company in 1859 in New York City. The brand's name was inspired by the notion that coffee should be served at eight o'clock in the morning, a time many families cherished for their daily brewing ritual.

From the start, Hinkle focused on high-quality Arabica beans, putting quality over quantity. This decision laid the foundation for the brand's reputation, which would grow over the decades. The coffee quickly garnered a loyal following, thanks to its smooth flavor and consistent quality, making it a staple in many American households.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-eight-o'clock-coffee  
  
The expansion of Eight O'Clock Coffee took off in the early 1900s. In 1919, the company introduced its first pre-ground coffee, offering convenience to consumers. This innovation was America’s response to the fast-paced life of the early 20th century, allowing families to easily prepare their morning cup without the labor of grinding whole beans.

Through the Roaring Twenties, Eight O'Clock Coffee capitalized on its growing popularity by launching a marketing campaign that emphasized its exceptional quality and affordability. The brand became a household name, known for its distinctive red packaging. This iconic design has remained a recognizable aspect of Eight O'Clock's branding, even as the years passed.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-eight-o'clock-coffee  
  
During the post-World War II boom, consumer preferences saw a shift toward convenience, leading to further innovations in the coffee market. Eight O'Clock Coffee responded by embracing new technologies to preserve freshness and enhance flavor. In the 1960s, they introduced vacuum-sealed packaging, which ensured that every bag of coffee retained its rich aroma and taste long after it left the roastery.

In 1988, a significant shift occurred when Eight O'Clock Coffee became part of the marketing giant, the Newell Rubbermaid company. This acquisition allowed for greater distribution and expansion into new markets. The brand continued to evolve, introducing additional blends such as the popular ""Original"" blend and a variety of flavored options to cater to diverse consumer tastes.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-eight-o'clock-coffee  
  
As the coffee culture evolved in the 1990s and 2000s, so did Eight O'Clock Coffee. Recognizing the growing trend of gourmet coffee, they launched a line of specialty coffees. Consumers began to seek premium quality, and the brand positioned itself as a serious competitor in the specialty coffee market while remaining committed to its roots of affordability.

Today, Eight O'Clock Coffee continues to thrive, committed to crafting quality coffee you can rely on. The company sources its beans from the world's best coffee-growing regions, ensuring each batch meets its strict quality standards. They offer various options, including whole bean, ground coffee, and single-serve cups, catering to modern lifestyles.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-eight-o'clock-coffee  
  
The brand has also embraced sustainability, choosing to partner with coffee growers committed to ethical practices. This focus on environmental responsibility has resonated with a newer generation of coffee drinkers who prioritize ethical sourcing. Eight O'Clock Coffee is not just a beverage; it’s a commitment to quality and responsible farming.

1hrcebh,https://i.redd.it/dczak5885gae1.jpeg, rib pain on the left side under the left breast,"Wonder if it's muscle soreness or if it's heartburn. 

So like a lot of other people. I had a few drinks last night Had some soda with it basically shoulder and several shots I woke up today. Felt like I had some type of heartburn I ate One piece of tums that I had hanging around felt like I still had heartburn so then I went and I found some baking soda and I mixed it with water so I've used a tiny amount of that. 


Didn't eat anything today except for a Jimmy Dean breakfast bowl about 20 minutes ago. 

Seems like I got some type of soreness or rib pain. 


Went to the hospital a few weeks ago when I had a rash. They checked me out. Checked my heart out cuz I was sore in the middle of my chest where the rash was. They said everything seemed good. They put a machine on me EKG. They said oh it's beating fine. Your blood pressure is not bad. 


So I'm under the impression that what I'm experiencing isn't a heart problem or issue. But then again I'm not a doctor when it seems like is. My rib is sore under my left breast and it seems like I have a little bit of pain and the only thing I did was I rode a bike today down the street and back 

I will post a picture of the area Now I have been getting the occasional heartburn lately. I usually drink a cup of coffee or two a day so I'm sure that doesn't help. Plus I purchase processed food sometimes like fast food anyhow hopefully I'm just dealing with some type of acid reflux pain r maybe I overworked A muscle of some sort in my lower chest area. 

I don't feel arm or face pain or anything like that. 

Pretty much feels like some type of muscle soreness or something right on the edge of the rib by the bottom of the middle of the lower left breast like on the edge of the rib cage.

I don't exercise a lot like I used to so maybe whereas I've been more active the last week the area Is sore from riding a bike or lifting weights a few times.

Internally he wasn't good but he stopped splitting on me at least. Another year past and we seemed pretty healthy, but then he cheated with his ex. I don't think a healthy relationship could be satisfying for him. I think he got bored of it and needed more stimulation. I was happy living a 'boring', drama-free life with him at the time. It's been a while since we broke up and i've been thrieving, not sad at all, doing really well. I started dating someone else who I really liked and it seemed to be going really well but I feel like he's pulled back and I'm not sure how interested he is now lol. People say meeting someone new should be the most exciting part of dating but I just want to feel familiar with someone. And so that's what i've been missing about my ex just recently. I miss doing mundane things with him like drinking coffee and smoking cigs together and going on walks together. Not caring about how I look in front of him. I had never been as close to someone before. I think we felt really comfortable around eachother. But I don't like or love him as a person anymore. He didn't respect me and when things got bad they got really bad. My life is much more peaceful now. I'm sure one day i'll feel that sense of familiarity with someone else. His intensity at the start made it so we went really fast and pretty much skipped the getting to know eachother phase. I also don't feel that closeness with friends and family, even if we know eachother really well and even though I have some really sweet friends. ",3,1735765131.0,BPDlovedones,3,1.0,False
1hrccq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICIMI2/comments/1hrccq8/_/,🌅 ,"Morning x 

Just woke up. Ain’t had a proper nights sleep since I’ve got here. Was up for 24 hours yesterday so KO’d pretty hard but still only managed to sleep for 5 hours. I did have 4 coffees the other day though so was probably pretty wired! 

Still ain’t had a sandwhich or a cigarette actually. But I will. Been pretty good, not been having random midnight snacks but there’s definitely been an overload on carbs for sure. And yes, the food. Next level. I’ve been wowed with first bites of new foods on multiple occasions. Still need to try the pressed juices. 

Plan is just to chill today. Been abit full on since we got here, gone to the old town and the hills. Couldn’t see a thing up there. Crazy foggy. And navigating with a kid can be awful. With or without a stroller. Either killing the arms by holding them for so long whilst trying to ensure nobody pick pocketing you or trying to push through crowds using the stroller like a snow plough. 

Your leaving today? Already? I swear it was a few more days. I guess 32 days can be abit much. Especially with the elderly and always having to take them into consideration too. I’m glad that you still have had fun despite the downsides. Quick little dentist trip before you go? Box full of fruits? You manage to sort the paid for luggage?

Here are five real-life scenarios where a VPN can make your life easier:

1. **Staying Safe on Public Wi-Fi** Ever connected to Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, airport, or hotel? These networks are often unsecured, making it easy for hackers to intercept your data. A VPN encrypts your connection, keeping your personal information safe.
2. **Bypassing Geographical Restrictions** Want to watch a show or access content unavailable in your country? A VPN allows you to connect to servers in different regions, unlocking a world of entertainment and information.
3. **Shopping for Better Deals** Prices for flights, hotels, and online shopping can vary based on your location. Using a VPN to switch locations helps you find better deals and save money.
4. **Avoiding Bandwidth Throttling** Sometimes ISPs slow down your internet speed when streaming or downloading large files. A VPN hides your online activity from your ISP, helping you avoid throttling and maintain consistent speeds.
5. **Maintaining Anonymity Online** From protecting your search history to preventing targeted ads, a VPN ensures that your online actions remain private and secure.

At Secyber VPN, we focus on providing features tailored to these everyday needs. Whether you’re streaming, shopping, or just browsing, our high-speed servers and security features have got you covered.

On my old pot, I’d lift and place back on the burner to keep it at a steady, but even flow. No sputtering on old MP. The new one sputters from the get go. Today it was sputtering so badly, and barely filled the top pot halfway before I gave up and went back to old reliable. Which produced perfectly.

In the beginning, we've been talking daily and met about once a week. We went for walks, had coffee dates and went skating together. Later our dates got less frequent but they got more intense with deeper topics and always ended with kissing. 

Texting also got a lot less frequent during that time, it usually took her a day to answer, I didn't mind though because I thought our dates were going very well and also she's really busy with university at the moment. She's a law student and her final exams are in February. So she really is under a lot of pressure at the moment. 

On our last date, which was four weeks ago, she came to my place for cooking. After watching a movie and cuddling a lot she told me that she's a little worried about our texting situation. She said that normally when she's interested in someone, she would be thinking about him much more often and she would be messaging him much more often than in my case. She even cried when she opened up to me about this issue. I told her, that her head is probably full with university stuff at the moment and that texting is not that important to me. 

I told her that she should just try to enjoy the times we see each other and don't think too much about this texting issue. She agreed that she felt very safe and comfortable around me and that she really enjoyes the time we see each other in person. I also made clear that I can wait with our next steps until after her exams. We cuddled a lot that night and she also slept at my place. I didn't initiate sex though, because I felt it was inappropriate since she had a vulnerable moment.
On the next morning we went for a walk and there was a lot of kissing when she said goobye. 

Since then we couldn't really see each other because of our schedules, christmas and right now me being on vacation. We had set up a date in January though to go ice skating. I tried to keep in touch with her but it always took her several days to reply, which was really frustrating. So I asked if our ice skating date is still happening and now she's telling me that we're too different and that she feels that there's nothing more for us to talk about.

We're still going to meet next weekend, not for ice-skating but instead for talking. She made kind of clear to me that she doesn't want to continue this. I don't really understand how this happened, because the last time we saw each other everything seemed perfect to me. I really want to save this.

I’ve struggled with falling asleep, staying asleep; waking up, having a good sleep schedule/rhythm. . the list goes on

This is really a terrible problem to have, if you can’t get a good night's rest before an important event, or enough to stay healthy it can really negatively impact your mood, productivity, focus, and even intelligence.

I used to be extremely guilty of not being a morning person, snapping on people I love because I just was so tired and irritable 24/7

I decided if I was going to live until 60 that I needed to get my sleep in check. I’m a very scientific person, so I dived deep into sleep research. It’s pretty amazing how far things have come even in the past 10 years

There’s still a lot about sleep that science can’t explain, so for the sake of being thorough I didn’t ignore wives tales, colloquialisms, or “non-scientific “ sleep aids in my research

The good news is we understand the falling asleep part very well. It's what happens while you're asleep part we don’t understand as deeply. 

So in this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that cause you to fall asleep and then I'm gonna tell you **how to hack these systems** in your body to make falling asleep your superpower.

If you don’t care about the science I'll be breaking the post down like this so you can skip around

* **What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)**
   * How Adenosine affects intelligence & personality
   * How Adenosine affects health 
   * What Caffeine does
* **Cortisol and Sleep** 
   * What does Cortisol do?
   *  How to manage Cortisol

# What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)

Adenosine is this crazy, misunderstood molecule. I call it the sleep molecule and it’s really the hero of our bodies but most of us hate it.

See Adenosine’s only job in the body is to make sure you get enough sleep, and it's very very good at making your life increasingly miserable until you do.

**How Adenosine affects health** 

So while most people think the effects of not enough sleep are grumpiness, sleepiness, memory loss. This is actually adenosine trying its best to protect you from the real effects of not getting enough sleep

* Type 2 diabetes 
* Colon cancer
* High blood pressure
* Dementia,
* Death. (Literally.)

 So who’s the bad guy again?

Down to its core, Adenosine is just a neurotransmitter in our nervous system that builds up the longer we stay awake

It binds to receptors and sends electrical signals through your nervous system telling it to start feeling sleepy. The miserable days  come when Adenosine levels rise early and often.  And it's almost always because you are fighting against Adenosine instead of working with it.

**What Caffeine does**

Our societal response to fighting the sense of sleepiness and tiredness is caffeine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine receptors like a car in someone’s parking spot–but it can only hold the spot for so long.

When the caffeine wears off (4-6 hours on average), the parking spot is empty again. And all this Adenosine has just been waiting in the street ready to surge into the spots that caffeine was blocking just minutes before.

This Is The Crash…

But what's making all of this Adenosine?

It’s not just enough for us to understand what Adenosine does, if we want to live in unison with it, we need to know how it is made.

Adenosine comes from several processes in the body, but there's one commonality between them all.

They are all byproducts of releasing energy. Essentially you can think of it this way. Every time your body consumes ATP and expends energy, Adenosine is produced.

Now Adenosine flows through your brain, attacking your function. Begging you to shut down before it's too late.

**How Adenosine affects intelligence & Personality**

Higher Adenosine is correlated with mood swings, frustration, anger, stress. In other words, grumpiness. It sneaks into your personal and emotional life without permission and causes you to act out of character. Lash out at loved ones, and make bad decisions. 

Adenosine also attacks your cognitive function, making it harder to think, remember things, and put ideas together. All of your thoughts become slow through the fog of weariness. 

Interestingly, at a certain point the stress adenosine causes in the body triggers a cascade of adrenaline and other hormone release that can temporarily overpower the effects and give a “second wind” but I'll touch on that in another post.

So we know we can't win the fight against the sleep molecule. Our only choice is to live in harmony with it. This alignment will create harmony in day and night like a violin in Legato. Soothing you in your sleep and lifestyle. But there’s one major force impacting this harmony that we have to understand first. 

Adenosine is the mechanism that drives sleepiness, but what is the mechanism that drives wakefulness?

# Cortisol and Sleep 

Now that you understand that Adenosine is like a policeman walking throughout your entire body ensuring you get the rest you need. Let's introduce something called Cortisol.

**What does Cortisol do?**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that peaks in the morning to promote alertness and declines at night to support restful sleep. 

Unlike Adenosine, Cortisol is a Hormone. It is released from your adrenal glands and not billions of cells. This is neat because all glands have a trigger to them, like a gun. 

When the trigger is squeezed by a number of sensory inputs we will discuss later, a pulse of Cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream. 

So regardless of what sensory input causes the release of Cortisol—whether it's you waking up or your alarm clock—it alerts your entire nervous system and musculoskeletal system that it's time to start moving. Declaring a new and fresh day–

Or at least trying to. When you have trouble getting out of bed and starting your day it’s because  your adrenal glands are misfiring.

Failing to release this hormone into your bloodstream—and letting early Adenosine levels have their way with you leaves you no choice but to pour up that hot cup of coffee. 

Like a car,  you can fix the misfiring of your adrenal glands, it just needs an oil change and some tuning

**How to manage Cortisol**

The most effective sensory input that triggers that strong pulse of Cortisol from your adrenal glands is Sunlight.

This is how the adrenal glands get the green light to release these hormones. They respond to the Hypothalamus, a region in the brain that monitors sunlight. 

When sunlight is detected, a chemical signal is shot down to the adrenal glands that causes the firing of the hormone. The brighter the sunlight the stronger the signal. When sunlight is detected from a low solar angle (like sunrise) the chemical signal is amplified.

Misfiring and malfunction of the adrenal gland is rare when the signal is strong and direct. \[see process below\]

\[link removed, check post history for link\]

So, if your lifestyle requires you to be up early in the morning, it is very important that this pulse of cortisol is released early. It should be like a rising tide early in the day and recede as the day progresses.

While I did say sunlight is the most effective sensory input, notice that the strength of the signal to release Cortisol is dependent only on brightness. So for those early birds that beat the sun u\[p, there’s still hope. There’s actually an upside of beating the sun.

Because physical exercise and fitness also serves as strong sensory input that triggers the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. That is why those who typically work out in the morning are more alert compared to those who don't. 

This also means that if you are working out in the late evening, closer to your bedtime, you are fighting uphill against those cortisol levels to fall asleep.

Now imagine waking up early, going on a walk or slow run, soaking in the sunrise, flooding your body with Cortisol, and then starting your day.

When you pair the healthy relationship between the sleep drive molecule and the wake rive molecule, you enter a completely different realm of restfulness and wakefulness. This is how you make your sleep your superpower. \[see sleep/wake cycle below\]

\[link removed, check post history for link\]

The two drives work In complete harmony, mimicking one another, and elevating your sense of being.

With a strong and steady sleep and wake drive cycle, understanding and fixing  your circadian rhythm is a downhill battle now. And the solution should make much more sense.

Now that you know how to manage that wakefulness and sleepiness drive, let's talk about how to maximize that sleep you do get and how to get the most out of it.

1hrby0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/1hrby0j/fun_episode_idea_that_should_have_happened/,Fun episode idea that should have happened ,"This is an idea I had for a funny episode. 

The episode is called ""The one with the paintball""

The gang decide to do paintball but they need 2 more people to take part to get 8 people.

Chandler is with Janice at the time, so he invites her.
Rachel and Monica talk about it at the coffee house and invite gunther.

At the paintball place, they split into 2 teams of 4.
Let's say team A and team B!

Team A:Janice, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey.

This team works as Janice is with Chandler. Joey is best friends with Chandler, and Phoebe and Joey are close. Plus it would be funny to see Joey get annoyed at Janice laughing all the time. Imagine Janice laughing as she shoots the paintball gun!

Team B:Monica, Rachel, Ross, Gunther.

This would work as we see Rachel and Monica's friendship. Rachel and Ross I don't think were together when Chandler dated Janice but we see their friendship slowly getting to the point of being a relationship. 
Imagine, Gunther would be about to Rachel, but he is interrupted by Monica and Ross arguing over their game strategy!

Does anyone else have any ideas on this?

Or any made up episode ideas too?

“I can’t believe you did that!” I laugh.

He smiles, grabs my hand, and kisses it, “Yeah, well, it made you smile.”

We keep holding hands, “Mom wants to do dinner. Where do you want to go?”

“There’s that new Italian place. I could go for some pasta and wine.”

I call my mom, “Hey, Mom, want to go to that new Italian place? We haven’t been yet.”

“Sure, Little Pup, that sounds nice.”

Luke stumbles over something and falls over.

“Mom, I’ll make a reservation and pick you up? I gotta go. Luke, are you okay? Love you, Mom.”

“Love you too, Mark.”

“What happened?”

He’s staring at a spot on the ground.

“I dunno. I tripped over something hard, but there’s nothing there.”

He reaches for the spot.

“...Nothing.” He whispers.

I looked up the restaurant. “Hello? I want to make a reservation for three, please. Mark Terrance. Seven o’clock? Sure, that’s fine. Thank you.”

I grab Luke’s arm and help him up.

“What was that?”

“I’m not sure.” He kicks the ground. “Stubbed my toe.”

“Why are you so fixated on that spot?”

“I thought there was something here, but... there’s nothing.”

“You’re being weird.” I giggle, “Come on, Kelly is waiting for us at the coffee shop.”

I grab his hand and continue walking. “Mom liked the idea of the Italian place.”

He stumbles again.

“You’re clumsy today, aren’t ya?”

“Ouch, fuck. Felt like I kicked a metal block.”

He trips and falls to the ground.

“What the hell is going on?” I ask.

“I can barely move.”

“What do you mean?”

He lays still on the ground.

“It’s like I’m pushing through something thick in the air.”

I wave my hands around him. “But there’s nothing here?”

“Of course there is! It’s heavy and holding me down.” He struggles.

I attempt to lift him. He’s heavier than usual. “What the...”

He falls through me.

“Luke!”

A loud thud erupts from his fall, and the ground shakes.

“I can’t move...” He slurs.

I reach toward him, and my hands go through him.

“Luke! Please get up.” I cry, “What’s going on?”

I lay my head next to his. “I love you, Luke.”

“I love you too, Mark.”

He convulses and fades into nothing.

I scream into the void.

I get up and stumble over his body.

“There’s nothing there.” I think.

I stare at the spot and call my mom, “Hey, Little Pup,” she says.

“Hey, Mom. I made us a reservation for two at the new Italian restaurant.”

“Are you okay?”

“Yeah, I think so. Feel like I was crying, don’t know why, though.”

The wedding band on my finger fades away.

“That’s weird.”

It’s been a whole month since I went sugar-free! The first few weeks were testing, but honestly I went for sustainability over purity aka the lazy keto route (carb intake under 50g).

No longer does the Costco pumpkin pie on the kitchen island make me feral, only slightly obsessive. I constantly have to remind myself that one bite will lead to my inhaling anything that has sugar (this hasn’t been my first attempt at a sugar-free diet). But when it’s out of sight, it’s out of mind. 

Things I feel are worth noting:
- I still binge eat 
- I need to cut out wine
+ coffee with a splash of half and half is everything to me// I can enjoy study sessions at the cafe without paying $11 for a drink
+ I’m forced to keep busy 
+ self-care improves unless I drink wine or binge eat meat and cheeses
+ cooking has been more enjoyable 
+ mood stability 
- I’ll never have bubble tea again 😭 (maybe for my birthday idk)
+ watching baking shows while on the elliptical is very satisfying 
- eating out is kind of a chore. 
- my spending has gotten out of control 
+ I’m happier overall

I'm in the coma club. 335 bench and 405 squat and deadlift. But it took a while to get there and i could have gotten there if i had just one more supplement...

Sleep.

I’ve struggled with falling asleep, staying asleep; waking up, having a good sleep schedule/rhythm. . the list goes on

This is really a terrible problem to have, if you can’t get a good night's rest before an important event, or enough to stay healthy it can really negatively impact your mood, productivity, focus, and even intelligence.

I used to be extremely guilty of not being a morning person, snapping on people I love because I just was so tired and irritable 24/7

I decided if I was going to live until 60 that I needed to get my sleep in check. I’m a very scientific person, so I dived deep into sleep research. It’s pretty amazing how far things have come even in the past 10 years

There’s still a lot about sleep that science can’t explain, so for the sake of being thorough I didn’t ignore wives tales, colloquialisms, or “non-scientific “ sleep aids in my research

The good news is we understand the falling asleep part very well. It's what happens while you're asleep part we don’t understand as deeply. 

So in this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that cause you to fall asleep and then I'm gonna tell you **how to hack these systems** in your body to make falling asleep your superpower.

If you don’t care about the science I'll be breaking the post down like this so you can skip around

* **What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)**
   * How Adenosine affects intelligence & personality
   * How Adenosine affects health 
   * What Caffeine does
* **Cortisol and Sleep** 
   * What does Cortisol do?
   *  How to manage Cortisol

# What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)

Adenosine is this crazy, misunderstood molecule. I call it the sleep molecule and it’s really the hero of our bodies but most of us hate it.

See Adenosine’s only job in the body is to make sure you get enough sleep, and it's very very good at making your life increasingly miserable until you do.

**How Adenosine affects health** 

So while most people think the effects of not enough sleep are grumpiness, sleepiness, memory loss. This is actually adenosine trying its best to protect you from the real effects of not getting enough sleep

* Type 2 diabetes 
* Colon cancer
* High blood pressure
* Dementia,
* Death. (Literally.)

 So who’s the bad guy again?

Down to its core, Adenosine is just a neurotransmitter in our nervous system that builds up the longer we stay awake

It binds to receptors and sends electrical signals through your nervous system telling it to start feeling sleepy. The miserable days  come when Adenosine levels rise early and often.  And it's almost always because you are fighting against Adenosine instead of working with it.

**What Caffeine does**

Our societal response to fighting the sense of sleepiness and tiredness is caffeine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine receptors like a car in someone’s parking spot–but it can only hold the spot for so long.

When the caffeine wears off (4-6 hours on average), the parking spot is empty again. And all this Adenosine has just been waiting in the street ready to surge into the spots that caffeine was blocking just minutes before.

This Is The Crash…

But what's making all of this Adenosine?

It’s not just enough for us to understand what Adenosine does, if we want to live in unison with it, we need to know how it is made.

Adenosine comes from several processes in the body, but there's one commonality between them all.

They are all byproducts of releasing energy. Essentially you can think of it this way. Every time your body consumes ATP and expends energy, Adenosine is produced.

Now Adenosine flows through your brain, attacking your function. Begging you to shut down before it's too late.

**How Adenosine affects intelligence & Personality**

Higher Adenosine is correlated with mood swings, frustration, anger, stress. In other words, grumpiness. It sneaks into your personal and emotional life without permission and causes you to act out of character. Lash out at loved ones, and make bad decisions. 

Adenosine also attacks your cognitive function, making it harder to think, remember things, and put ideas together. All of your thoughts become slow through the fog of weariness. 

Interestingly, at a certain point the stress adenosine causes in the body triggers a cascade of adrenaline and other hormone release that can temporarily overpower the effects and give a “second wind” but I'll touch on that in another post.

So we know we can't win the fight against the sleep molecule. Our only choice is to live in harmony with it. This alignment will create harmony in day and night like a violin in Legato. Soothing you in your sleep and lifestyle. But there’s one major force impacting this harmony that we have to understand first. 

Adenosine is the mechanism that drives sleepiness, but what is the mechanism that drives wakefulness?

# Cortisol and Sleep 

Now that you understand that Adenosine is like a policeman walking throughout your entire body ensuring you get the rest you need. Let's introduce something called Cortisol.

**What does Cortisol do?**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that peaks in the morning to promote alertness and declines at night to support restful sleep. 

Unlike Adenosine, Cortisol is a Hormone. It is released from your adrenal glands and not billions of cells. This is neat because all glands have a trigger to them, like a gun. 

When the trigger is squeezed by a number of sensory inputs we will discuss later, a pulse of Cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream. 

So regardless of what sensory input causes the release of Cortisol—whether it's you waking up or your alarm clock—it alerts your entire nervous system and musculoskeletal system that it's time to start moving. Declaring a new and fresh day–

Or at least trying to. When you have trouble getting out of bed and starting your day it’s because  your adrenal glands are misfiring.

Failing to release this hormone into your bloodstream—and letting early Adenosine levels have their way with you leaves you no choice but to pour up that hot cup of coffee. 

Like a car,  you can fix the misfiring of your adrenal glands, it just needs an oil change and some tuning

**How to manage Cortisol**

The most effective sensory input that triggers that strong pulse of Cortisol from your adrenal glands is Sunlight.

This is how the adrenal glands get the green light to release these hormones. They respond to the Hypothalamus, a region in the brain that monitors sunlight. 

When sunlight is detected, a chemical signal is shot down to the adrenal glands that causes the firing of the hormone. The brighter the sunlight the stronger the signal. When sunlight is detected from a low solar angle (like sunrise) the chemical signal is amplified.

Misfiring and malfunction of the adrenal gland is rare when the signal is strong and direct. \[see process below\]

[https://imgur.com/a/BZ2lxQA](https://imgur.com/a/BZ2lxQA)

So, if your lifestyle requires you to be up early in the morning, it is very important that this pulse of cortisol is released early. It should be like a rising tide early in the day and recede as the day progresses.

While I did say sunlight is the most effective sensory input, notice that the strength of the signal to release Cortisol is dependent only on brightness. So for those early birds that beat the sun u\[p, there’s still hope. There’s actually an upside of beating the sun.

Because physical exercise and fitness also serves as strong sensory input that triggers the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. That is why those who typically work out in the morning are more alert compared to those who don't. 

This also means that if you are working out in the late evening, closer to your bedtime, you are fighting uphill against those cortisol levels to fall asleep.

Now imagine waking up early, going on a walk or slow run, soaking in the sunrise, flooding your body with Cortisol, and then starting your day.

When you pair the healthy relationship between the sleep drive molecule and the wake rive molecule, you enter a completely different realm of restfulness and wakefulness. This is how you make your sleep your superpower. \[see sleep/wake cycle below\]

[https://imgur.com/a/RYIIK7n](https://imgur.com/a/RYIIK7n)

The two drives work In complete harmony, mimicking one another, and elevating your sense of being.

With a strong and steady sleep and wake drive cycle, understanding and fixing  your circadian rhythm is a downhill battle now. And the solution should make much more sense.

Now that you know how to manage that wakefulness and sleepiness drive, let's talk about how to maximize that sleep you do get and how to get the most out of it.

1hrbm1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hrbm1i/aita_for_exposing_my_sister_to_our_parents_after/,AITA for exposing my sister to our parents after finding out she’s been lying about needing money for “medical expenses”?,"I (32F) feel sick even writing this, but I need to know if I went too far.

So, my sister (29F we’ll call her Emma) has always been the “golden child” in our family. She’s the baby, the one who could do no wrong. For the past year or so, she’s been telling our parents that she’s struggling with “medical bills” and needs help financially. She’s always so vague about it she’ll say things like, “Oh, my insurance doesn’t cover this specialist” or “I need this medication that costs hundreds of dollars every month.” And, of course, my parents always give her money. They’re retired now and living on a pretty tight budget, but they love us and would do anything to help.

Here’s the thing though: Emma doesn’t look like someone drowning in medical debt. She’s constantly posting pictures online (not where our parents can see them, of course) of herself at fancy restaurants, wearing designer clothes, and even going on vacations. I tried to brush it off for the longest time because maybe she’s just “treating” herself despite being stressed out. But the more I thought about it, the more it just didn’t add up.

Last week, I ran into one of her friends at a coffee shop. We started chatting, and out of nowhere, this friend was like, “Wow, Emma’s life seems so amazing lately! I wish I could afford half the stuff she buys.” She even mentioned Emma’s plans to go to Europe in the spring. I was like, “What??” because my sister had JUST told my mom she needed $2,000 for some medical test.

After that, I couldn’t let it go. I checked her social media , and it was all there designer bags, nights out, receipts from luxury stores, even photos from a spa weekend. There wasn’t a single hint of anything remotely related to medical problems.

I confronted her when we were alone, and she tried to deny it at first. But when I pushed harder, she finally admitted it. She laughed and said, “It’s not like they can’t afford it. Besides, I deserve to live a little. They’d just waste that money anyway.” That was the moment I saw red.

I went straight to our parents. I showed them the photos, all of it. My mom was devastated she actually started crying and my dad looked so heartbroken. They’d been sacrificing for her, even dipping into their retirement savings. My dad said something like, “I thought we were helping her stay alive.” It absolutely crushed me.

Emma, of course, found out what I did. She’s been blowing up my phone with texts calling me a jealous b\*tch and saying I’ve ruined her relationship with our parents. She’s also been telling mutual friends that I’m “vindictive” and just looking for a reason to “take her down.” A few friends have even said I should’ve handled it differently, like talking to her first or minding my own business.

But how could I just let her keep lying and draining our parents dry? They’re not rich—they’re retired! What if they’d run out of money because of her?

Now the whole family’s a mess. Emma isn’t speaking to any of us, and my parents are heartbroken. Part of me wonders if I went too far by exposing her like that, but I felt like they deserved to know the truth.

A very useful alternative to the IVAR folding table.,"Old photos; forgive the mess, was still DIYing.

Been meaning to make this post for a while now. Might not be a surprise to folks here but I've not seen mention of it. I was so happy to stumble across this when planning my remodel as it's such an elegant solution. I have a modest 1 room flat with no space there or in the kitchen for a full sized table, and needed shelving along the wall. I love to cook and host, and wasn't gonna compromise on my ability to throw dinner parties.

It's perfect for me as I can just unfold the one side as you would the IVAR built-in table when I'm alone or with my partner, but can pull it out into the room when I've got more people over. I keep the large table cloth and extra table settings in the drawers, needed only in its full configuration.

Not visible in the pics, but I keep some old stacked stools in the narrow IVAR section on the right for extra seating, and they also double as mini coffee tables when called for. The only reason the table isn't quite flush with the shelving in these photos is because my baseboard catches the bottom of the drop-leaf. I plan to trim it in the future.

Altogether a wonderfully practical, versatile, and compact setup.

1hrbgmh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrbgmh,"AMA: 100 lbs in 1 Year, progress pics. ","From Jan 1st to Dec 31st, I lost 100lbs, a little over 1/3rd of my body weight. 

Happy to do an AMA if anyone has questions or is just starting out and I can share my experience. 

Quick background, it was not f@%king easy. 😂 I spent 3 nights a week on the road travelling for work for 40 weeks of the year. I was in the hospital twice and never actually went above 7.5mg due to shortages and doctor screwups. (WW/Sequence is great, but they suck sometimes.) 

For exercise: 

- I walked 3miles per day. I started with 0.5 mile, then worked my way up, then I added a 25lb vest and then finally a 40lb vest to wear whenever I was home. I walked 780 miles this year. Goal is 1000 next year. 

- I followed up the walking every day with two ten minute session each of hot tub and sauna when I was home.

- Every weekend, I golfed, either on the course, or at home on the patio with a net, 100+ shots. 

- I am slowly working my way to the gym. I hate the gym, it’s a boring place imo, but I don’t want to get back to where I was. 

For food:

- This sucked the most especially while I was travelling, I don’t have enough fingers and toes for the number of times I spent doubled over in a foreign bathroom, hurling my guts out because I made a stupid decision. It took me until mid-year to get it sorted and even then I still struggled. (Christmas Holiday parties 🤢🤮)

This is how I ended up Q3/Q4.

- At home, I drank bulletproof coffee in the morning before my walk right before my walk. On the road, I had a Celsius and skipped breakfast. 

- I got a salad every day for lunch with lots and lots of protein. Sometimes Chipotle salads, PBK chicken cobb, and a few other closer places so I had a variety to choose from. 

- Dinner was protein, all protein and solid carbs like potatoes or rice. When I was on the road this would be a steak if I could get it or chicken and rice at Chipotle if not. 

- lots of fat usually made my stomach hurt, so I avoided fats but grabbed avocado and nuts whenever I could. 

- I phased out snacking almost entirely. 


Other helpful things:

- Make a goal, I had a Q3 goal of a European golf trip. It was 10 days and 8 rounds of golf, all walking. I went and it was one of the most amazing experiences. I’m excited to go again next year. 

- Tums, classic tums, not the GasX crap. 

- Don’t let other comments slow you down. I work with a lot of international people who have ZERO emotional intelligence I’ve been told everything from “you are half the man you were” to “who’s this skeleton?” And people constantly try and bribe and tempt me with food. 

Take it in stride, they are jealous and wish they had the mental fortitude to make a decision to better their lives. But tbh, some of them were right. If you look “sickly” maybe you need to give it a rest. Take a day or to fuel up.
live. 

- Plateau’s are common, I hit multiple weeks of no movement, i freaked out at first, but then I started treating them as rest weeks and it helped a lot. I fueled up, ate more worked out a little less and then dove right back in and every time it dropped like a rock. Give your body a break. 

Next Years Goal:

- Move to maintenance, we’ll see where it goes next year. I’m potentially moving to a local doctor to work on a more robust plan. 

- 13% body fat. 200lbs seems a good weight for me, I’m quite tall so hopefully some body recomp and build some muscle. 

- figure out the loose skin and skin tears situation. Open to advice. ",48,1735762688.0,Zepbound,8,1.0,False
