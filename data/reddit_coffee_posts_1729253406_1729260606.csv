I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!😛

That said…I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

I live in western CT but travel regularly all over CT, western MA and upstate NY for my business😉

1g6ixc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1g6ixc0/just_started_propranolol_have_a_question/,Just Started Propranolol - Have A Question,"Hey Everyone - here's the TLDR - my main issue is dizziness/light headedness. I was prescribed propranolol yesterday, which I see has a main side effect of dizziness/light headedness. Has this medication been helpful for those in my position? I see it mentioned here often as having really helped out and I am really looking for hope for getting my life back.

I have very little experience with prescription meds, but I do understand sometimes a side effect can be the very thing you're hoping to help. So if it's just one of those things, I'll roll with it! Meanwhile, I've made some changes in my life such as cutting out caffeine and chocolate (much to my dismay), started yoga, had my first ever therapy session, compression socks, salt, you know the drill. I'm really trying. 



I'm yet another one of these people that have a classic case of getting COVID (3 months ago) and shortly after developed POTS symptoms, which started with passing out in a coffee shop in late July and not really being right ever since. My main issue is dizzy/lightheadedness pretty much all the time, every day. 

Skipping over all the usual BS you are all familiar with in even arriving to getting some help, I was finally prescribed propranolol yesterday by a neurologist who happens to be one of my dad's best friends since childhood. Even he was about to push me to a different specialist but I said I was desperate to try something out and would like to try medication, so I got my prescription yesterday.

1g6iw3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g6iw3a/coffee_scale_responsiveness_on_adding_very_few/,Coffee scale responsiveness on adding very few beans,"Last Christmas I was gifted a the Bodum coffee scale which has a 0.1g resolution. However, when weighing coffee I often have the problem that it doesn't react when adding 1 or 2 beans.

Let's say I'm aming for 15g and it's at 14.7g, so I add 1 or 2 beans but nothing changes. I then add another two beans and it jumps to 15.2g. I then go back and forth with removing and adding beans until I hit my desired 15.0g.

I can work around the unresponsiveness after adding a few beans by lifting the dosing cup and putting it back down or pressing down the scale with my finger but it's just an annoyance in the workflow.

I wonder if other scales have the same issue or if it's just my model or even my individual scale. It could even be that my scale is damaged because my little nephew leaned half his weight on the scale while I was not looking because he ""wanted to weight his arm"" (kids... 🙄 I scolded him but of course that doesn't undo his action). 

If other scales are more precise and even react on single bean changes (given it weights more than the scale's resolution) I'd consider buying another scale.

I've been seeing a guy (40m) I met on Tinder for about a month. We really hit it off, have been casually dating, going for coffee, and  hanging out at each other's places in our free time. We text and play online games together everyday and there's flirting/teasing involved. He told me in passing conversation he deleted his Tinder a couple days after our first date.

One day last week he mentioned that he didn't have time to date because of various responsibilities. I felt a bit confused at that because it seemed to me dating was what we were doing on a casual basis to determine interest in a relationship, as the chemistry is good and we've only been seeing each other. But I didn't know at that point. So I asked for clarification and asked him if we're hanging out in the context of going on dates for the intent to get romantic, as opposed to being just friends.

He told me he thinks hanging out will figure that out, he has no preconceived notions, and he's going with the flow and seeing where it goes. ""Tldr: I dunno, we'll figure it out lol""

I'm not offended at it by any means, as I don't want to push. Most of my previous relationships have been rushed into without much thought, so thats actually refreshing for me. 

In your experience, does this mean a man is looking for a girlfriend or is looking for a less committed situationship type of thing? I like our connection so I don't mind taking it slow, but I don't want it to end up where we stay in the situationship trap and it doesn't ever progress.  That seems like a waste of time for me. I also feel like it's only been a month and I may be over-thinking it 😅. It's the first time since I've been single that a Tinder match has went well past just chatting.

I posted this on another page and someone suggested I'll give it a try here...

So i had a daydream about a story of a boy that moves out of the city with his family to a beautiful small town. The town had beautiful scenery that looked green and cold and had stunning, beautiful mountains and looked all fall like...

And the boy and his family lived at the top of the mountain while the rest of the town people lived under them, and they viewed the new family as mysterious and a little weird because they mainly kept to themselves. 

There was this small family owned coffee shop that was run by this lovely young man.. and also there was the mans' little brother and his friends (it's just him and his brither, their parents died..)

And the town people didn't accept the new family really well because they thought they were arrogant and snobby city people but they really weren't.. except for the two brothers who were fascinated by outsiders and thought nicly of them. And the little brother and the new city boy started to get along and maybe fell on love (??)
also there might have been werewolves or vampires or some kind of mythical creatures involved. 

I don't know why I gave you all of these details but I just wanted to give the right idea as to what vibes I had in mind...

So if you know of any tv show or a movie or even a podcast that feels like this - small town, fall, gay, mythical creatures, new in town... I'd really appreciate any suggestions 😊

1g6iqis,https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1g6iqis/what_do_you_do_if_drugstore_tooth_whitening/,What do you do if drugstore tooth whitening treatments have done NOTHING for you?,"I've been insecure about my teeth since I was a really little kid (maybe 7 years old), which was when people first started pointing out that my teeth were yellower than everyone else's. I say this not to ask for pity, but because I'm worried this might have something to do with why the tooth whitening treatments don't work.

I've tried a bunch of the drugstore tooth whitening treatments over the years. A bunch of the different Crest strips of varying quantity and adjective in the name, a few different kinds of 'whitening toothpaste' I kept up for months, a whitening pen with that fluid you spread over your teeth that I immediately hated and gave up on. Basically anything you can buy over the counter. I have a random CVS brand strip in my mouth right now as I type this.

I don't think my teeth have ever whitened more than maybe one shade, and even that doesn't happen with every treatment I get. I don't mean that it's patchy, like some people complain happens when the coverage is inconsistent, but I mean both mirror-examining and photographing my teeth in different lighting all show little, if any, difference before/after that's perceptible to my eye. My teeth just always look the same. Slightly yellower than everyone else. The same shade forever. Not a concerning colour, but just a little bit worse than usual.

I don't really want this to become a dentist problem, because a full dental whitening is really expensive and it's not like I'm tortured by not having white teeth or anything. I also worry that a dentist whitening won't do much either -- if my teeth don't respond at all to commercial whitening products while others' teeth do, what does that mean for me?

I'd be really interested in your experiences with this, and if this is any cause for concern. Was there anything those of you with stubborn yellow teeth tried that finally did ... well, anything?

For added context, I have never smoked in my life and I don't drink coffee at all. I have a tea maybe once a month. I would say I consume an ""average"" amount of flavoured beverages and acidic fruit, which is to say more than a dentist would like but not so much that it would bring me out of sync with everyone else (so why are their teeth still whiter than mine?).",1,1729259996.0,beauty,0,1.0,False

Photo 2 – Pork Chops with Garlic Herb Butter. Was initially shocked on the portion of rice. But manage to finish it😅. There were 2 pieces of pork chop. One was thicker than the other. Both of them were fried to crisp. Sides were crunch. Unfortunately, the thinner cut was over cooked to the core. So it was already dry and a little more effort was needed to chew. I was also seated where on the path of the AC, so the butter did not fully melt😪. Salad was baaaad, it was sooo dry and I could say it was prepared very advance. ⭐⭐⭐ for the pork chop alone.

Photo 3 -  Hickory Ribs. This was not my order. But I have to help finish it so its gonna be part of my review. Very smokey, the BBQ sauce was too sweet for me. Meat was very tender and the “bones” were missing😂. ⭐⭐⭐

Photos 4-5 – Japanese strawberries and Cream, yogurt berry cake, kahlua chocolate mousse, tiramisu. Photos are not the actual order. There were 9 of us, only 4 of us ordered. But when the cake arrived, everyone one wanted to taste. So the cakes were immediately demolished as soon as it landed on the table. 

a.	(I was told the) Japanese strawberries and cream was good, but I really cant tell as what I got was only the cream😂. In fairness, the chiffon was very fluffy.

b.	Yogurt berry cake. This the probably the one I was able to eat plenty as they didn’t like the sour taste of the yogurt, which I absolutely love. TBH, it wasn’t it was mildly sour at best, but you can still taste it. ⭐⭐⭐⭐

c.	Kahlua chocolate mousse. Very little cake and mostly mousse. I wasn’t as sweet as I assumed it to be. I was also able to taste the bitterness of the kahua. ⭐⭐⭐

d.	Tiramisu. I passed on this.

**Memory transcription subject: Lerai, Venlil Trainee**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 1st, 2136.*

++++++++++

  

I watched the footage on the holoprojector silently, my thoughts swirling. The news anchors were animatedly discussing the recording and the events, the usual back-and-forth spiel of one favoring the Humans’ official response about a simple lapse of judgment on Noah’s part and praising his quick thinking in preventing a suicide attempt by the rescue, and the other drawing a harder line about the predators’ intentions in some bid to make the station appear neutral, but none of it was really registering in my mind.

At some point, I wandered closer to the couch and the screen without even realizing it. *Th-The Arxur… gave up cattle? How long ago did this happen?*

*I-Is Mom…?*

“Mmmph…” came a tired groan from below me. I tore my eyes from the screen and glanced downward at Dad, who was blearily looking at me with one eye. I tasted alcohol in the air. “You’re late,” he said simply.

“I-I know. I’m sorry…”

He rubbed a bit of the sleep from his eye, and his gaze hardened. “What happened?”

“I-I, um…” I didn’t like lying. “A-At the bar, a H-Human showed up. Things got… messy.”

“Messy?”

“A-A Letian started yelling about them being allowed in the bar. Soon everyone was yelling, and the Letian… h-he tried to attack one of Vyrlo’s friends.”

“Your friend was *attacked?*”

“H-He’s fine. We took him to a clinic. I-I just…” I hugged my arms to my chest, looking away. “I don’t want to talk about it tonight, please.”

Dad watched me silently for a moment, and I found I couldn’t look him in the eye. “And then later? You messaged me that you were going to Vyrlo’s apartment for a little while.”

“Y-Yeah.” *Maybe I shouldn’t have done that…* “H-He just wanted to make sure I was alright.”

“At *his apartment?*”

“I-I guess so?”

His eye narrowed. “Are you two together?”

“Wh– Oh, uh… no.” My face bloomed a bit.

“Are you sure?”

“Y-Yes.”

There was another lull in the interrogation. Eventually, though, Dad’s gaze softened. “You know I’m only giving you a hard time because I love you, right?”

I swallowed a lump in my throat. “I-I know.”

“I mean it. Even if I might not understand, you know you could tell me anything.”

I blinked away tears, ears drooping. For a moment, I considered spilling the secret right then and there. Maybe he *would* understand…?

But I quickly shook the thought away. No, there was no chance of that. He could barely handle looking at a Human as he was, so learning that they were teaching his daughter how to fight would be too much for him. And it wasn’t even really about whether he’d accept it or not – he was too *hurt* to need to trouble himself with my own problems, too. They couldn’t know. Not yet.

So instead, I said nothing. An awkward silence permeated the room, Hiyla looking between the two of us from her spot on the couch.

After a pause, Dad sighed. “I just… I wish I knew what you were doing out there. I know you’re an adult, and you’re the one bringing in the money. I can’t tell you what to do. Just… for my sake, try to tell me things, alright? I don’t know what I’d do if something happened to you.”

“I’m sorry… and I know. I don’t know what I’d do if something happened to you, either.”

Dad flicked an ear. “I’ll just leave it at that then.” He turned his head just a bit, looking at the holoprojector. “They’re still showing this story… have you heard about this?”

I tried to push my feelings aside, at least for now. “N-No, this is the first I’m hearing of it too.”

“We’ve been watching for a little while,” said Hiyla, not taking her eyes off the flickering projection. “Th-They said… They said there’s a way we can look up names. See if anyone we know i-is… s-still alive…”

My tail and ears went still. “W-What…?”

“Yeah. They said that the Humans have been pushing to try to reunite families quickly. O-Or at least, as quickly as they can. Apparently a lot of the rescued people are… pretty messed up.”

“We didn’t want to find out without you,” Dad interjected. He whistled a low chuckle. “Or maybe I just needed you both here for my own sanity.”

“W-We could find out… right now?” I muttered. Everything this paw had just happened so fast, and now *this…*

“That’s right,” said Dad. His features and tone were completely neutral.

“I…” I wanted to be happy. I could find out if Mom was alive… there’d never been any true closure one way or another about what had happened to her. All we’d ever received was news about the raid, and confirmation that she’d been among those taken.

And yet, none of us could really look at one another, the awkward silence returning with a hint of somberness. We all wanted to have hope, but… none of us wanted to be the one to say it. It had been too long, the chances of her being alive at this point were so infinitesimally small as to practically be zero.

“W-Well… m-maybe we’ll get good news!” Hiyla said a bit forcefully. “M-Maybe she did survive somehow! We could… we could see her again!”

“...Yeah, maybe,” said Dad. “That would be really nice.”

He reached over the edge of the couch towards the floor, and his paw returned with an empty glass. With a groan, he shuffled to a stand. “I can already tell I’m going to need a refill for this. Hang on. Hiyla, you’ve got the form up, right? Why don’t you two start filling it out?”

“A-Alright…” she agreed. Dad shuffled off towards the kitchen while Hiyla pulled up the form. I rounded the couch to sit next to her, and she scooted towards the middle cushion.

I was still in a bit of a daze. *I could… I could find out…* Shaking my head, I tried to clear my thoughts, at least for long enough to help Hiyla fill out the form.

We scrolled through the page, going from question to question. It asked for all sorts of identifying information to give the greatest chance of locating the rescued person; name, age, height, last known address, known family members, occupation, government ID number… the list went on and on. And with every answered question, as we got closer and closer to the button to submit the information, the pit in my stomach only grew.

Dad returned with a filled glass of something viciously strong. He sat on the far end of the couch with Hiyla between us, and took a sip, his eyes squeezing shut and ears pinning back as he swallowed. “How’s it going?” he asked.

“Almost done…” Hiyla muttered.

He placed the glass on the tea-table and leaned in a little closer as Hiyla filled out the last question. Right at the bottom of the form was a disclaimer that even if the listed person was found, family may not be able to visit right away due to the fragile states of the victims.

My sister’s digit hovered over the “submit” button, shaking slightly. I leaned in closer, wrapping my tail around her, for her sake as well as my own. “...You know her chances aren’t good, right?”

“I-I know…” Hiyla’s voice came out strained. “B-But maybe, just maybe…”

“It’ll be good to know for sure,” said Dad. His own voice carried a tone I couldn’t place. He looked at the form for a moment. “Are you both ready?”

“Yeah,” we answered. I knew we were both lying, there was no way we could be ready. The pit in my stomach had grown to a yawning abyss.

He looked between the two of us. “Yeah, me neither,” he eventually said. “Alright, little blossom. Go ahead.”

The moment between Dad’s words and Hiyla’s paw tapping the button felt like an eternity. Despite my own words and thoughts about her chances being slim, I couldn’t stop this tiny seed of hope from sprouting inside me. Maybe… maybe she *had* survived, somehow. Mom was the bravest, strongest Venlil ever. If anyone could survive being Arxur cattle for years, it’d be her.

I could already envision it – the program informing us that she was alive, us reuniting as a family, continuing our lives together as though all of it had never happened. Going places together, doing things together… I’d introduce my herdmates to her, and she’d love them despite their status as predators. She’d tell us the grand story of how she’d killed all the Arxur and commandeered the ship to safety. She’d help get the other exterminators off our tails, and I wouldn’t need to learn to fight anymore. Maybe I could just do it for fun if I wanted. I wouldn’t have to worry about Predator Disease, or a double life.

What would Mom think, if she found out? Would she be proud? Or afraid?

Would I ever find out?

Hiyla’s claw tapped the button. A circular loading bar appeared for a brief moment. All of us held our breath, and the results appeared.

*Mawasi (ID: 20764318921), Age 35, Exterminator at Starlight Grove Exterminator’s Guild*

*110 Mountain Flower Drive, Starlight Grove, VP*

*—————*

***NAME NOT FOUND***

*++++++++++*

…We all silently stared at the results.

“U-Um…” Hiyla broke the silence, her voice wavering. “M-Maybe I entered something wrong…?”

Dad’s ears simply flicked a “no.” “That’s her ID, little blossom.” His own voice was strained.

“W-Well…” My sister’s eyes were filling with moisture, as were my own. “M-Maybe they just haven’t found her yet! O-Or she’s alive, b-but they haven’t added her info! Or sh-she escaped on her own somehow! Or, O-oR…!”

She let out a sob, and the pad fell to her lap as she wiped her eyes with the backs of her paws, but she couldn’t stop the flow of tears.

“Oh, Hiyla…” I whimpered, as I reached over and pulled her into a hug. On her other side, Dad leaned into both of us, wrapping his tail around us as he held a paw to his face. It was taking everything I had not to break down myself.

“I-I just… I just miss her so much…!” Hiyla cried.

“I know, I know…” I tried to soothe, for both of our sakes. “I do too.”

“We’re here, my little blossom. It’s alright,” said Dad softly. His own voice was wavering, and he choked back a sob.

We all cried, and we all mourned, holding each other for support. In truth, I had already known that it was false hope. This galaxy was too cruel to allow for such a miracle. But, still…

*Mom… I miss you. I wish you were here. You’d know just what to do, how to handle all of this. Not like me. I’m…*

*I’m still* ***weak***\*.\*

We grieved until we had no more tears to shed. At some point, Hiyla cried herself to sleep in our arms and tails. Dad gently took her and laid her on his lap, and after the briefest moment of hesitation, I laid down next to her. My feet hung over the armrest of the couch. I hadn’t even bothered to shed my jacket or bag, and I just didn’t have the energy to do so anymore. This paw had been utterly exhausting, and I felt completely drained, not to mention it was far past my usual bedtime. And yet, something kept me awake.

“...I had my hopes up,” I said idly to Dad. I just felt numb. “I don’t know why.”

There was a pause, as Dad let out a breath. “In truth, flowerbud… I did too. But we already knew, didn’t we?”

He reached over, careful not to jostle my sister, and took a long pull of his drink. “It’s just… there was never a *body.* Nothing to mourn. And I know why, the Arxur aren’t really known for leaving anything of their victims behind. But… couldn’t we at least have had that?” He let out a bitter scoff. “Maybe those damn greys do it on purpose. I can’t think of anything more cruel than building up our hopes like that only to tear them away.”

I stared at the ceiling. “Maybe,” was all I could say.

Silence hung in the air. The holoprojector had long moved on to another story. News about the ongoing war between Humanity and its allies, and the Federation. We lived in turbulent times, but right now… I just didn’t care. What an absolutely horrible paw this had been.

I looked out the window. The sun was at the halfway point between its zenith and its nadir, creating a calm dusk and dimly lighting the room. In about seven or eight claws, Night would be here.

“...Do we… want to find her star?” I asked. “It’d give us *something…*”

“Yeah. I think it’s time,” agreed Dad. We’d been putting it off for the exact reason Dad had said: there was never a body. “Next Night?”

“Next Night.” I let out a sigh. “I should go to bed… but I don’t even have the energy to get up and walk to my room.”

“Why don’t we just sleep here on the couch this claw?” offered Dad, as he shut off the depressing news.

I immediately recognized the words that weren’t being said. *I don’t want to be alone this rest either…* “Sure, that sounds good.”

I scooted in, and Dad laid down somehow. It was cramped, and a bit warm, but it was something that we all needed. I found myself snuggling in closer, burying myself in the thick pile of wool created by three Venlil. “Good rest, Dad,” I said quietly.

“Good rest, flowerbud.”

As we lay there in the silence, my thoughts turned back to Mom. Old, happy memories. Us playing in the park, her keeping the town safe and regaling us with tales of bravery. Her embarrassing me at school on the occasions she came in on patrol. Even things like scoldings when I made mistakes had taken on a more pleasant tint in my mind.

She’d always been more interested in helping the community, than on things like cleansing predators. It was part of her job, sure… and every so often she’d have to clean out a vilterwen den or respond to a shadestalker sighting. But she was most well known for pushing to invest in the town and its people. Trying to create programs to keep non-violent offenders out of facilities, and instead help them reintegrate back into society. She’d always believed that if the herd did more to help those who fell behind, then PD and criminal cases would naturally reduce. Of course, her ideas rarely went through… She and Chief Exterminator Selgin would often butt heads, and sometimes we’d hear complaints about her boss at the last-meal table.

She really was the best of the best… and she had always been my idol.

“...Hey, Dad?” I asked. I didn’t know if he was still awake.

“Mmm?” He muttered sleepily.

I let out a breath. “We were supposed to talk when I got home.”

“...I guess we were.” I felt him shuffle a bit, trying not to disturb us too much. “What is it?”

Unconsciously, I clenched a paw into a fist and brought it up to my chest. The feeling was still there, at a simmer. It probably always would be. Would Mom have understood it?

My eyes closed. “Will I… ever be as strong as Mom?”

The question hung in the air, and I waited silently for an answer. Hiyla was pressed somewhere around my back, and I could feel the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed.

“...Your mother was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of woman. She was the bravest, strongest Venlil I ever knew,” Dad eventually said. “And you’re her daughter. I think that if you want to be… you can be even stronger.”

“...I don’t know if I can do it…” I said quietly to myself.

“Yes, you can, flowerbud…” he muttered sleepily. “You already do… more than you think…”

“I do?” My eyes opened. “Like what?”

I waited, but I didn’t hear a response. “Dad?” I asked, shuffling to glance towards his face. His eyes were closed, and soon I heard a soft whistle as he fell into a deeper sleep.

I sighed, and just tried to get comfortable. Between my hoodie and the two wooly bodies surrounding me, I was feeling pretty hot… and the warmth was only adding to my exhaustion.

I closed my eyes, and soon I fell into a dreamless sleep.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 2nd, 2136.*

++++++++++

  

When I woke up, I didn’t feel much better. I still felt numb, and once again I hadn’t gotten nearly enough sleep.

Dad and Hiyla still clearly had their wool tangled, themselves. We ate first-meal in an awkward silence, and said brief goodbyes to one another as we walked out the door and headed to our respective destinations.

Work wasn’t… horrible. Or at least, not as bad as last paw – I ended up with hedge-trimming duty, which wasn’t as grueling or dirtying as digging holes. But this paw, *any* work just felt especially draining. I happened to run into Vyrlo, who was moving fertilizer for flowerbeds, and I affirmed that I was still good to meet him at the gym a quarter-claw after we got off, and that I’d send him the location. I’d brought the entry card from home for the occasion, and warned the others in advance. I briefly considered just telling him I wanted to skip today, but I honestly needed the distraction, and my friends seemed really interested to meet the Yotul.

My mood hadn’t improved, and my exhaustion hadn’t waned by the time I was done for the claw. The whole time, I just kept thinking about Mom, and about the fact that I’d never see her again, and the pit in my stomach would grow wider and wider. It was just like the paw when we’d first gotten the news all those years ago, the news that had made Dad storm off in a fury like I’d never seen… and had kept him away for a hundred paws, to be returned a shell of his former self.

I had my second meal, just a simple salad with some sliced roots. It was all Hiyla had wanted to put together. And it was still good, I think… but the taste seemed muted this paw.

I still had a little time to waste, and I found myself wandering. I decided to cut through the market again on a passing whim, and I idled aimlessly down the busy thoroughfare mindlessly examining various wares. None of it really caught my interest today, and it wasn’t like I could afford much of anything worthwhile.

It was starting to get darker with each passing paw, and some of the stalls that were caught in the shadows of surrounding buildings were brightening their businesses with all kinds of lamps, lanterns and lights. Despite the usual hustle and bustle of tourists and locals, there was a serenity to it all… and yet, I was trapped in my own thoughts, ambling without purpose or direction.

As I drifted, though, a familiar burnt taste happened on my breath. And in a moment of clarity, I spotted the source; a stall run by a friendly older Gojid.

*I guess I am still pretty tired…*

I walked up to the counter. “Hey, Pikro,” I greeted, interrupting his dishwashing in the back. The stall wasn’t particularly busy, only two other customers occupying seats at the counter. A lot of people still didn’t trust the strange predator drinks.

“Hey, welcome!” He turned to greet me, and his ears rose in recognition. “Oh, hey, it’s you! It’s, uh…”

I opened my mouth to tell him, but he held a claw in the air to stop me, shaking it slightly as he tried to place a name to a face – and more likely, a jacket. Suddenly, he pointed that claw at me. “Lerai, right?”

I huffed in a muted amusement. “Got it in one.”

“Yes! Hear that, dear? Not that old yet!” He chuckled to himself at his own joke. “Have a seat. You look like you’ve been run over by a harvester.”

“Oh, stars, is it that obvious…?” I took one of the stools, slouching forward on the counter. “I feel completely wilted.”

“Well, let’s get a little pep in your step, then. What’ll you have?”

I stared at the menu. I still didn’t know what half this stuff was… “I don’t know… any recommendations?”

“Sure, I’ll make you a mocha. A lot of Venlil really like them.” He turned towards his machinery, beginning the meticulous process of grinding the roasted beans. “So, what’s got you so down?”

I glanced at him, tearing my eyes from a spot on the counter I’d been staring at. “That’s obvious too, huh?” I asked.

“I’ve been around long enough to tell. Did something happen? I’m happy to lend an ear, if you want to talk about it.”

“...Yeah,” I replied. My eyes went back to the counter. “Did you hear about that cattle exchange the Humans did?”

“I did,” said Pikro, speaking as he worked. “Actually, I looked up some people I knew from the Cradle two days ago. A lot of Gojids I knew didn’t evacuate in time.”

“Huh…” *I didn’t consider that. Makes sense he’d know about it.* “Any hits?”

“Out of twelve searches, I got one. A cousin, recovering somewhere on Colia. I can’t see him yet, though… I heard he lost a leg, and, well, his burrow’s collapsed a bit, if you catch my meaning.”

“One out of twelve…” *I don’t know if that’s better or worse…*

Rather than dwell on it, though, he turned an eye to me. “Why do you ask?”

“Because I… had someone to look up too.” I took a deep breath that wavered a bit on the way out. “M-My mom, she…”

“...I see. I’m sorry.”

“Thanks,” I replied. “She was taken years ago. I already knew that there was no way she’d be alive after so long. But it still hurts. It’s like… It’s like hearing about her capture all over again.” I didn’t really know why I was telling the man all of this. I barely knew him, I’d only met him once a few paws ago… maybe I just found him easy to talk to.

“It never gets easier, does it?” said Pikro, as he took the ground beans. This time, though, instead of putting them in that pitcher of his, he instead began packing the grounds down and putting them in a different machine. “When I was filling out those forms to look for friends and family, every single time I’d get that little feeling of hope. I just thank the Protector that it was justified at least once.”

I let out a long sigh. “I just… wish she could tell me what to do,” I said. “I always looked up to her. I want to be *like* her… but I just feel like I’m getting blown around in a storm half the time. I’ve got a million problems and no answers for any of them.”

“Hmm…” muttered the Gojid. “You know, I don’t know if it’s the same for you, everyone grieves in their own way. But sometimes I just find myself wondering… ‘why me?’ Why did *I* survive, out of all those Gojid on the Cradle? Why didn't someone younger, with more time ahead of them, make it to the evacuation ship instead of me?

I glanced up at him. “Pikro, you shouldn’t think like that. There was nothing you could have done at the time.”

“That’s what everyone always says, but it’s never so easy as *not thinking about it*.” The new machine started slowly dripping out a thick brown liquid that looked different from the coffee I’d had the first time. “But, well, despite everything that’s happened, and all my thoughts about it… here I am. Making weird alien predator tea for Venlil, at least half of whom are convinced that one sip will make them crave flesh or something. Because you and I… we’ve survived all the crap this galaxy has dropped on us. Whether it’s exterminators high on their own fumes, or all-out war.”

He took the brown liquid, but instead of serving it to me right away, he began adding various other things to it. Some white stuff from a carton that had a picture of a nut or seed on it, and some different brown powder, along with a little sugar. He kept speaking as he worked. “So, we just keep surviving, for the people who didn’t make it. Just putting one foot in front of the other, one day at a time.”

“...I guess that’s all I can really do, isn’t it?” I muttered. My head dropped to the counter with a dull *thud,* my built-in head protection stopping any pain. “This galaxy sucks. Can’t it give either of us a break?”

“Well, the universe doesn’t care when we complain. It just keeps going on anyway. So if we want a break, we’ve got to keep working hard until we get it.” The Gojid looked back towards me, and an ear rose in amusement. “But also… sometimes we can help each other out, and smooth each other’s quills a little bit.”

The “mocha” was done, and he placed the cup in front of me. “It’s on me. From one survivor to another.”

My head rose from the counter, and I looked at the cup of steaming brown liquid, then back at Pikro. “I-I can’t accept that–”

“It’s alright. Go on.”

Hesitantly, I took the cup. It was strangely foamy, yet the steam around the drink tasted nice and sweet… and after several claws of feeling nothing, I felt a warmth in my chest. Not the usual thirst for fighting, but something else entirely. “Th-thank you…” I muttered, staring at the liquid.

The Gojid’s ears raised in a pleased contentment. “It’s my pleasure.”

Suddenly, another Venlil sat at one of the far stools, and one of Pikro’s eyes looked their way. “Welcome! I’ll be right with you!” he called towards them, before stealing a glance back my way. “Hang in there, alright? This galaxy *does* suck, but sometimes it has a way of letting things work out.”

He took off towards the new customer, and I was left alone with the drink. Carefully, I picked up the cup and took a sip. It was hot, and I nearly burned my tongue, but it was rich and bittersweet. I felt my chest warm further as it traveled down my throat, and my tail wagged idly behind me, occasionally brushing against a passing pedestrian.

“...It’s good.”

My 18 year old second cousin has come to live with me for college.  I didn’t know her well prior to this and am not close with her parents.  When I agreed to the arrangement I felt like an 18 year old would pretty much be an adult, but I have since found out how wrong I was!

I’ve had several hurdles come up that I’d like advice on.  First, the “bad”.  Her room is disgusting.  Not just clutter but leaving food out (the dairy containing coffee drinks are the worst), leaving wet towels bunched up, not cleaning her toilet to the point it has black rings. Now, when I outright tell her to clean she will….but I don’t like that I have to tell her to do so.  I was hoping it would be more like a roommate situation (my fault for not understanding what I was getting into).
She also mocks me if I say something too much like a “boomer”….mock as in repeat it back with that sing song tone. I’m not a doormat but I don’t know how to “discipline” someone I’m not in the position to do so if that makes sense. 

And the “good”…she does seem to enjoy telling me about things in her life, which I really do enjoy (even if it’s exhausting how self absorbed she is and how all our conversations center around her ha!).

1g6iifa,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g6iifa/interviewing_this_afternoon_for_a_temporary/,Interviewing this afternoon for a temporary position in a parochial institution. I have a question.,"This might not be the best place to ask this question, but the Temps subreddit is a graveyard. 

The last time I interviewed in a similar situation, it was going incredibly well and they all but insinuated the job was mine (it was a permanent position last time).

As an afterthought question, the interviewer said, ""oh - so you know this clinic is church affiliated, right?"" 

I answered affirmatively.

He asked me my thoughts on that. I didn't have much time to prepare for the question so I answered honestly (in retrospect that was probably the intent of asking the question as I was effectively walking out the door). I think I said something along the lines of, ""I view my job as a combination of things I do to help an organization run efficiently and the people I work with. I've enjoyed everyone's company during my visit here and believe my views on faith won't play a role in my ability to blend in and do my job well."" 

I knew as I walked out the door that was the incorrect answer. 

This job is temporary to cover a short-term absence. Really, my faith shouldn't play a role at all and FWIW, I was raised in the faith to which the institution is connected. 

For grins and giggles, I checked out the staff page over coffee and see that everyone with a write up leans hard into the role faith and the faith's primary figure plays in their day to day activities, so I'm pretty sure the topic is going to come up again. 

I'm fine with others' faith and have become proficient at the smile-and-nod should the topic as applies to them and/or me comes up, and deflection in a social setting where there's no value to getting into it. Also fwiw, I actually kind of envy people with such genuine faith that they do great things with their deity at the core of their (genuinely) good works.

The agency said they seemed particularly overjoyed that someone is willing to come talk to them as they weren't having any luck with trying to find a little help from within their own community. 

I kinda need this position. Anyone have any advice on what tact I might take that won't have them ejecting me from the building before I can even thank them for their time? I can't lie. Although I'm actually quite skilled at it, but I won't on this subject as I'll be there long enough - well into Advent, actually - that it will become apparent that I haven't seen the inside of a church since my Mother's funeral in 2009.

It’s been a lot of him telling me he loves me and calling me the same pet name the first couple of months and then taking a huge step back once he realized I was moving here where he lives to study. 

He had a mutual friend move into the house I was supposedly going to move into with him. She broke up with her boyfriend to date women, but this guy has done everything in his power to make her feel supported, to promote her in their jobs, to make sure she feels loved. 

He pushed me out of everything, pushed away from all of his real friends he’s known forever to form a new group of friends. 

He will reach out occasionally telling me that he tried to commit suicide. That his health has been awful. That the girl living with him now has to save him and without her he’d be dead.

He monitors everything I do still. He even told me he monitors our mutual friends list. 

He wanted to meet up and give me back my things, but the first meetup was at a coffee shop. First meetup he was so guarded but we felt like us at the end almost. He hugged me so long before he got back on the train. 

Next meetup we bought a game together and he took me out for lunch. It was chill. He told me about this meetup of all these friends where I wasn’t invited even though it was my birthday. 

Most recent meetup was a lot. He baked me something for my birthday, but also brought back most of my things I had left at his place. He saw my place for the first time and I mentioned how I wanted to see his, and he said he and the girl that moved in needed space. She isn’t interested in him but I think he wants her, he wants people that aren’t easy to obtain. So I got upset and told him how much I’ve been there for him despite everything. And he went into a depressive spiral at lunch saying how he tried to kill himself just last week. How he has no idea who his friends are. Honestly he’s a shell of who he was I almost don’t recognize him sometimes. He says he needs space yet here he is wanting to meet up. He told me not to pine for him. That we need a lot of space and then maybe we can reset and be close in whatever way. That he doesn’t want me around because there’s too much emotions there. That he has a shelf of all of the stuff I got him for his sake to help him. That he still has feelings for me but can’t be my boyfriend. That he needs to work on himself. 

We went to pool and it was fun and salvaged that, but then he told me the girl living with him was the closest person in his life now because he always sees her. He told me he knew that I unfriended her because he stalks my friends list and why would I burn the bridge. 

He went back to my place and was talking about getting the remaining stuff to me. And it was sad. He grabbed my hand and we held hands a while and he started hugging me telling me it’s going to be alright very sweetly. I told him I loved him and he said it back. Then I asked if he wanted to kiss me and he said it wouldn’t be good for us. 

After that I was so confused I took some time. He was sending me a lot of polite messages saying he wanted to meet up again and that he needed his cookie container back. Asked if my parents were okay during the hurricane ect. 

I posted on insta I was gonna be going to a singles night and he reached out saying he saw it and that “I’m happy for ya” he said I deserved to be happy and put smiley faces everywhere but I dunno. 
Then just yesterday a friend tells me that she saw him holding hands with an asexual girl. If they are a thing this adds a huge layer to how fucked up everything is especially because he told me he couldn’t be in a relationship. Maybe it was friendly but damn I wish I could say after 8 months it didn’t hurt like hell to hear it. 

It’s so hard to get away. 
I know he probably doesn’t care like he says he does. Why does he keep monitoring me? Why does he keep wanting to meet up? 
I’m so hurt and I want nothing more to find someone who appreciates all my love for them but even after 8 months hearing he was holding another girls hand sent me in a spiral. 

I moved all the way to another country but I decided to stay to pursue my dreams despite him deciding I’m not enough

So I do this and nothing happened I restest in 15 mins and it says bac .000... well same thing this morning only this time I didn't shut my car off this time just ran the kids in and ran back out I had a retest within 10 mins and it said .012  but same thing nothing happened. I get work shut my car and it gives me the restart within 3 min thing so I did that and didn't get a warning or anything.

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

Which included a lot of YouTube videos and reddit thread reading.

**Background:**  
31M in US. I live in an area that doesn't have a lot of canyon roads or mountains but my town has the most roundabouts in the country. I have a racing and driving background and spend most of my freetime at motorsports events or sim racing.

**Other vehicles:**

* 2020 Dodge Ram 1500
* 2022 Tesla Model Y (Wife's car)

**What I was looking for:**

* Affordable (got my 2020 BBR edition for $28k in 2024 with 2.4k miles on her)
* Manual
* Fun at legal speeds
* Cheap parts / labor
* Resale value (good community, BBR package helps hold value imo)

**My Experience with cars:**

* I grew up in LA with the most famous canyons (Snake, Decker, Mulholland) in my backyard
* I have raced offroad and driven multiple road race cars, karts, rally cars, and supercars:
* Things I have driven recently include, 718, 987s, c8, c8 z06, aventador, 911 turbo s 992, lancia delta integrale, BRZ, WRX, M2 comp, and my Miata

**Cross shopping:**

* I cross shopped with a c8, m2, 987, 718, gr86, zl1 1le camaro and various vintage porsches (928,914, etc)
* Yes I know I was all over the place

**What was the problem with these other cars**

* More expensive
* Ridiculously long gearing (987 in 2nd does 75ish mph) same with the c8 and the c8 z06
* Doors on the corvettes are really really long (hard to get in and out of in a parking lot)
* Porsche maintenance and part prices (I do not own a shop or a lift, only a 3rd garage stall)
* Most of the cars only came alive at 60mph+, some were lifeless all together (looking at you M2)

**What about the miata you ask?**

* I thought the joke miata is always the answer was a running gag. But then I drove one. I really think it is a great, raw, driving experience and the chassis is just money. You can really feel the car beneath you and in your butt, and it feels quick to grab. I changed my sway bars out (tires next) and it already made an unbelievable difference in the body roll. Otherwise I don't think it really needs much more setup wise.
* The gearing is fantastic **for my use**. I live in an area with a ton of roundabouts. Nearest ""mountain"" type roads are 1hr+ from me. I can redline second below 50mph, I can hit my roundabouts in town with a fun blip downshift from 4th to 3rd and be on absolute rails hitting the roundabout at about 40mph give or take and still be in my lane and not getting any understeer or kick out from the rear
* The recaro seats feel amazing and are a great hybrid of a more performance based bucket seat like what you see in the porsche GT line, and a daily driver seat.
* It's just pure fun to drive, whether at 20mph or 75mph. Yes its loud on the highway, yes you can hear the rear end on bumps and such, but when you are driving the car it really does feel like just a stripped down gt car and you can feel it and hear it. Which is what I like.
* Would I DD one? Probably not. But I still drive mine to work probably 2 times a week in the nice weather months.

**Are there other cars for you instead of a miata?**

Of course, these would be my picks

* C8 or c8 z06. z06 flat plane is intoxicating. Car is FAST and stable. I would get one of these if I lived in California or somewhere with private track days and I was planning on doing track days at least 6x a year. I would also buy one if I wanted to spend that much on a car. But I didn't. C8 z06 over every porsche but the GT4 and the GT3 in my opinion
* 987s if you are looking for a more flashy car and want to be apart of the porsche community. I was scared off by these but thats just me. These cars are great if you have more open roads to let them eat. This car handles like a go kart at 65mph with ease. I just didn't want to drive that fast.
* Gr86. If you were going to DD a car, I feel like this might be a more reasonable option. The trunk in the miata is small, like everyone says, dont think you can fit more stuff in it than someone else it just wont work lol. The GR86 I think is the best option for a fun sporty daily
* Lancia Delta. My choice for vintage. Obviously hard to get but in the vintage category this is peak performance. The AWD paired with some beefy sway bars gives you more grip than you could ever think of for a 40 year old platform. Plus they're rocket ships even in low boost.

Overall, for a car you can find under 30k, great warranty, tried and true platform, good community and part availabilty I dont think you can go wrong with the miata. Just get out and drive one. Again I use this as a 3rd car, weekend car, cars and coffee, date night type car and I am ecstatic.",10,1729258571.0,Miata,4,1.0,False

I was asked for a few dates na rin and I usually don't
ari agree kapag hindi talaga ako interested sa guy. Sinasabi ko naman lagi sa kanila even before kaming lumabas na we should pay for our own meals.

Just recently, I went out with this guy. Sa mga chat naman namin, he sounded like a nice guy. May mga ilang topics lang he was naive and parang ako lang lagi yung nagdadala ng pinaguusapan kaya medyo nawawalan ako ng gana kausap. I tried to communicate that to him pero parang wala lang. 

Natuloy pa rin kami sa napagusapan naming date which is coffee date lang naman. Jusko po, I understand na he was shy and all pero ang ayaw ko talaga ay ako yung nagbubuhat ng topic namin. I'm a shy person din naman pero nilulugar ko. 

So at that point, sobrang walang gana na talaga ako, but I still had the decency na wag siyang iwanan. 

Then bigla niyang sinabi na paubos na gas niya. I checked and kalahti pa naman but since he picked me up, I offered na I'd pitch in sa gas. Kasi why would I damn pay for the gas alone? 

So nagpagas muna kami and this guy pointed at my side dun sa gasoline boy. Kinatok yung side ko kaya binaba ni guy yung window and I was so dumbfounded. 1k yung pina-gas niya so I gave 500 pesos dun sa gasoline boy but he pointed out na 1k nga total. So ako na nagpanic kasi ang tagal na namin don, nagbigay pa ng another 500. Sa isip ko, okay not a big deal. Then umalis na kami don. 

Ito na nga, nakarating na kami sa coffee shop. Umoorder na kami and I ordered a meal and drink kasi hindi pa ako nagdidinner, while he only ordered a hot coffee. I offered to pay for our whole meal since the cashier tagged it as one order lang so nakakahiya naman na sabihin, ""Ay I'm only paying for mine."" kaya dinamay ko na inorder niya and it wasn't a big deal naman pero pinigilan niya ko. Nilabas niya wallet niya and take note na hawak ko na yung card na ipangbabayad ko. I noticed na ang bagal niya kumuha ng pera literal ha so I immediately gave my card to the cashier since I don't want to stand there for too long. 

Humanap kami ng seat and he didn't even say thank you sakin. He was on his phone all the time. Kahit nung kukunin na yung order na ready na don sa counter, hindi niya ginawa. I nudged him na ready na yung order and he should get it pero tumingin lang siya once sakin and continued pressing his phone. So I stood up and went to the counter. Sinabi ko na ibalot yung stromboli and frappe na order ko and I applogized din for the hassle dahil nga bigla kong binago. After nilang mabalot at ibigay sakin, I immediately went out sa coffee shop nang hindi lumilingon doon sa kadate kong kupal.

Buti na lang may tricycle na dumaan kaya nakasakay agad ako. He texted me bakit bigla akong lumabas. He also called me multiple times pero hindi ko na sinagot. 

His last message na nireplyan ko: ""Hey, saan ka pumunta? Iniwan mo ko.""

I replied: ""i'm gonna be blunt na. Ang boring mong kasama. Ako lang ang tanong nang tanong sayo. Papalagpasin ko na sana yung fact na ako lang nagbayad sa date na yon kasi hindi naman talaga big deal, pero yung ikaw na nga lang kukuha ng order hindi mo pa ginawa?""

He said sorry and tinetest lang daw niya ko if I was a gold digger. Nagpantig talaga tenga and mata ko nang mabasa yon so nakasabi ako nang masakit sa kanya. 

""I didn't even think na may pera ka to begin with but I still went out with you. Goodbye.""

Oo na gold digger na ako langyang ma lalaki to. Sa susunod, kung meron man, kaoag may nagaya ng date, I'll make sure na hindi na ko magbabayad.

GOLD DIGGER NA KO.

I don't have any sources of my fund. I tried to apply to different coffee shops, school assistant, and virtual assistant agencies but they don't respond or they will reject my application. My Mom cut-off our connection since she doesn't want to help me anymore cause I am only adopted by my Dad who passed away last 2021. Binenta ng Mom ko lahat ng mga gamit, bahay at lupa namin at iniwan ako ng parang bula.

I'm doing my thesis right now, and I feel so devastated since di na ako kumakain halos dahil wala na rin akong pagkain. I always go to other places sa mga friends ko just to help myself na makakain at hindi magutom and simply hiyang-hiya na ako. Tomorrow, would be the due date sa rent and utilities ko and I don't know pano babayaran. I'm in the middle of my data gathering na rin this semester di ko na alam gagawin. 

Super hindi ko na alam ang susunod neto either mamamatay ako sa gutom, walang matitirhan or mawawala akong parang bula. Sana tapos na to, sana hindi ako.

He was 13ish when he passed. Me and my wife got him from the place we met when he came up to the fence and followed us around to the entrance. We knew then and there that he was ours. I remember when we finally got him home, after a month of background checks, and he climbed up the couch and got in my nook and put his head on my chest. He would always do that and he would put his little arm up on a pillow and sit like a people. Just a wonderful, beautiful little guy. 

I keep looking over the coffee table and thinking I'm going to see him pop up from his bed or that I see him coming back from the kitchen scrounging for food. His little bed is in our bedroom and for the past year and really over the past few months I had been helping him walk up and down the stairs. He would still sometimes do it himself if we went to bed early. Last night my wife finally got home from a work trip and we were laying in bed and she said I just want to hear his little tippy taps walk into his bed. But its just silence.

Our other dog didn't get to say goodbye to him either. I brought his collar, harness and sweater home with me on Wednesday and let her smell it. She just kind of looked at me and I thought she could tell. She's still been looking for him I think. Smelling his pee spots when we go for a walk. I don't know how to help her. She has not come up stairs since Monday when I took him to the vet. I was hoping that she would come upstairs after my wife was home but nothing yet. 

She misses her brother. I miss him and my wife misses him.

The new GYN (fired the old one) said she wanted to put me back on BC after it to manage my perimenopause symptoms. I’m not accepting this and hopefully I don’t have to fire her too. Here’s my tale of enough’s enough. 

Two days ago I had to go to urgent care for a sciatica problem. I was given a few prescriptions and told to take 800mg of Ibuprofen. Yesterday it was still bothering me so I moved to my recliner to work instead of my office. I grabbed the Wellbutrin I was prescribed to manage my inability to focus since my body started to our journey to shutting down the baby factory. 

I made my coffee, poured a cup and sat down to join a meeting at 5:30 AM. Six minutes later I cracked the first pill bottle open and in my multitasking half asleep state I accidentally took 4 300MG XL (that’s the extended release) tablets of Wellbutrin. For our non-medical folks, this put me at risk of seizures and cardiac arrest. Fortunately the risk wasn’t realized. But it did mean I spent 11 hours on a gurney in the emergency room hooked up machines, then another 13 hours under observation so far. I should be getting discharged but if it takes as long as it took for the doctor to get to me the first time for him to discharge me, it was 6 hours after I was admitted! 

To say I feel like a complete idiot is an understatement and I’m glad nothing came of it. I admit my mistake and won’t multitask with medications again. But I wouldn’t even be here if the GYN would just prescribe what I actually need.

Location of the hotel is on a very quite street side and just walking distance to a 7-Eleven that has a functioning soft served ice cream machine.

Photos 1-3. Room and amenities. 2 double sized bed with lots of pillows. It has a closet with rubber slippers inside. 1 tiny desk, stool, and a bedside table. TV with cable channel and not a smart TV. I think its built-in speakers are already defective which is why they have an external one installed. AC is too big (i think 2.5HP) for the room size and a bit noisy too. They also have an intercom which you could use to call other rooms including the front desk. There is also a very large mirror facing one of the beds, just sayin…😉

Photos 4-5. Comfort room comes with bidet and hot shower. Although the heater is a bit tricky to work out, but there is also the tabo and balde. Although the room is good for 4, there were only 3 soaps and 2 shampoos. Not sure if its really like that or they just forgot to refill.

Photos 7++. The hotel has a small boutique that sells imported and genuine (I cant guarantee this, but it is what that was stated there) products. From hygiene products, coffee, shoes, bags, shirts, caps and etc.

They also have a loyalty program. For every 5 nights stay, you get 1 free. But the free room is only good for 2 valued at 1,450.00. And everything should happen within the calendar year.

We were friends for a couple months and she slowly pulled back, eventually just stopped replying to me. I’m not the type to double text or blow her phone up. Now, we don’t even follow each other on anything, not that she uses social media often anyways.

I dropped her stuff off at her parents and her and I met for coffee last month.

We spent close to two hours and joking and laughing, catching up. We only left because they closed early. She’s been busy working 80 hours a week, pursuing a masters, and traveling for work. Always super busy I guess.

I didn’t get the chance to say what I wanted. I didn’t get a chance to say I’m sorry and to talk about the relationship because the coffee meet was light and well... I had wrote a nice letter to her and put it with her things, but she doesn’t live with her parents anymore so she didn’t get it. I didn’t bring it up.

We only exchanged a few texts after the coffee. Lastly was me saying “let me know if you’re around I’d love to hear more about x y z” but it was late and she didn’t reply…

Her best friend posted her on her story today. We still follow one another for some reason. I saw my ex’s face and it hurts inside… The temptation to just comment “fuck, I miss her” on the story is so heavy. The temptation to just text her happy birthday is there too, but considering I was left on delivered, I don’t want to double text.

Part of me thinks my ex doesn’t know I want her back. The friend would relay I commented. Maybe my ex would be like “oh shit he does miss me…”. Based on what I know about her I’m thinking she doesn’t realize I miss her or still love her; I always had to be kinda direct with what I say, not around the bush with her during our relationship or she didn’t pick up on what I was trying to say…

Another part of me thinks she’s over me. Maybe with someone new. She barely if ever keeps the conversation going on text. But she is (literally) super busy w an 80 hour week and a masters.

I don’t know. What do I have to lose? Her best friend unfollowing me? I don’t really care. It would be the last connection with my ex to sever anyways. But I don’t want to come across as desperate or weird reaching out to a friend of hers. But she would tell my ex and my ex would probably be like “weird” or something. Maybe not, maybe she’d be like “I didn’t know he missed me, I miss him too”

# Chapter Three

  

How many times had I dreamed of this moment? How many nights had I imagined walking down the aisle, the love of my life waiting for me at the altar?

Everything was perfect. Almost everything. Except for the man standing at the end of that aisle, the man I was supposed to marry. The man whose eyes were filled with cold indifference instead of love. My heart ached, and I blinked back the tears threatening to spill, refusing to let them make a scene.

The ceremony was a blur, a haze of vows and traditions I barely registered. My thoughts were consumed with dread as I realized what awaited me — a home where I'd be alone with him, a man who clearly didn’t want me.

During the car ride back, Sorin sat as far away from me as the backseat allowed, his gaze fixed outside the window, his silence as heavy as the tension between us. I wanted to say something, anything to break the ice, but the fear of irritating him kept my lips sealed. I couldn’t help but glance at him, at his strong profile, every feature so painfully familiar from the countless times I'd admired him from afar.

“Quit staring. It's irritating.” His voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. He cast me a brief glance, the look in his eyes sharper than his words.

“Sorry,” I whispered, my cheeks burning as I quickly looked away.

[*Italian Beige Sofa Bed*](https://pandacozycorner.com/products/italian-beige-sofa)



  
When we arrived at his house — no, his mansion — it felt like stepping into a dream, or rather, a nightmare. The place was as grand as one could imagine, but it held no warmth for me. It wasn’t a home; it was a gilded cage.

I followed him inside in silence, my stomach in knots as he led me to our bedroom. ""Our"" bedroom. I hadn’t expected that. Seeing the surprise on my face, he rolled his eyes and sighed. “My parents locked the other rooms. Apparently, they’re adamant that we sleep in the same one.”

Embarrassment washed over me. His parents clearly had hopes for this union that didn’t align with reality. He gestured towards the couch. “You’ll sleep there.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As I approached the couch, I noticed a pillow and blanket already laid out, a silent but clear arrangement. I sank into the cushions, trying to make myself comfortable.

""Wait."" His sudden command startled me. I turned, finding him pinching the bridge of his nose, visibly conflicted.

He sighed heavily. “Never mind.”

Confused, I resumed my place on the couch. But before I could relax, he spoke again. “No, wait.” He looked exasperated, as if warring with himself. “You can... share the bed. If you’re comfortable.” 

I hesitated, my eyes drifting to the bed. It was large enough for both of us, but sharing it felt too intimate, too overwhelming. Still, the couch wasn’t exactly inviting either.

“Are you sure?” I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded stiffly. “Yes.”

Taking a deep breath, I got up and slowly made my way to the bed. He laid down on one side, and I settled on the other, making sure to keep as much distance as possible. My back was to him, and I prayed that sleep would come quickly, though I doubted it would.

Just as I was starting to relax, I heard the sound of pillows being moved. I glanced over my shoulder to see him placing a row of pillows between us.

“I hope you don’t kick in your sleep,” he muttered, his tone dry.

Heat rushed to my face. ""I don’t think I do,"" I mumbled, though I wasn’t entirely sure.

The night passed in tense silence, but at some point, I must have drifted off. A sudden groan woke me, and I blinked groggily, trying to figure out what had happened. My heart sank when I realized that, in my sleep, I had somehow managed to kick Sorin in the chest.

“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” I gasped, covering my mouth in horror.

He glared at me, jaw clenched, clearly in pain. He shoved my leg back over to my side of the bed and got up without a word, heading straight for the bathroom.

“I’m sorry,” I called out again, desperate for some form of forgiveness. “Does it hurt a lot?”

He ignored me, his face a mask of irritation as he disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. A tear slid down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Crying wouldn’t help. Nothing would.

I decided to make breakfast, hoping maybe it would soften the edges between us. By the time I finished, I heard him coming down the stairs, impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit. He looked just as handsome as ever, but he walked past the kitchen without a glance in my direction.

“Um… breakfast?” I stammered, trying to gather the courage to speak.

He paused for a fraction of a second, then continued walking toward the front door. Without so much as a word, he left, slamming the door behind him.

I stared at the untouched plates in front of me, my heart sinking further. I sat down at the table and forced myself to eat, though every bite tasted like ash. The lump in my throat grew with each passing second as the reality of my situation settled in.

Sorin would never love me. I was nothing more than an inconvenience to him, a burden he’d been forced to bear. My heart longed for something, someone to care about me, but all I had was emptiness.

Tears welled up again, but this time, I didn’t bother to fight them back. No one would see. No one cared.

I just wanted to be loved.

For example, did you know about the shoe spell? Yeah, apparently if you write their name on a piece of paper and put it in your left shoe, it draws them back to you. But NOT the right shoe, because that one pushes them away. So here I am, walking around with a crumpled piece of paper in my left shoe, hoping the universe will literally walk my friend back into my life. Spoiler alert: it didn’t work. Now I’m just slightly more uncomfortable with every step.

And of course, I’m pairing this with the full Law of Attraction—positive thoughts, affirmations, visualizing us laughing over coffee like it’s The Secret. Every time I think about them, I’m sending out good vibes, hoping the universe is out there just waiting to drop them back into my life.


So tell me... is it just me trying to manifest friendships back, or has anyone else tried to bend the laws of the universe for a little miracle?

I'm looking to buy my first espresso machine and could use some advice. Initially, I was set on the Gaggia Classic (\~400€), but then I came across this machine: the MiiCoffee Apex, CRM3007L, AVX - DB1 Plus (also known as the Turin Legato v2 in the USA). These are just a bit more expensive than the Gaggia but seem to offer a lot more features.

I know these alternatives are from Chinese brands, which has me a bit concerned about their long-term reliability. That said, their build quality looks impressive. With the Gaggia, there's a huge community and plenty of spare parts available, which makes it feel like a safer bet. I'm looking for a machine that will be reliable and last for years—something like the Gaggia. My usage will likely start with weekends and holidays, but I could see it becoming a daily habit in a year or two (probably heavier use after warranty haha).

Does anyone have long-term experience with any of these machines? Would love to hear your thoughts!

[Coming to a theatre near you this December OPEX...](https://preview.redd.it/0ukh90kemivd1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f09de4f9d7d0916e753c6b16e4e21ed4493c62)

You read that title right. The December Options chain finally started trading yesterday and it is a unique one. So, in addition to our daily movement analyses, we're going to take a look at this options chain structure and see what it could mean for us as we head into the first days of our Q4 quarterly options cycle.

**Price Movement Recap**

By now, I'm sure you've noticed from several posts on Superstonk that yesterday's volume was the lowest we've seen since 5/1. This is correct. It is also correct that it was the first day of total volume under 3mil since 5/1. Not even our low-volume days in August corresponded to total daily volume that was this low. Many are pointing to the fact that these conditions directly preceded Keith's return and a sizable run in the stock even before Keith had anything to say about.

While the particular similarities between these conditions are correct, context also matters. We are coming off a bullish reversal on testing a 'bottom' / price minimum now just like in May. However, it is difficult to anticipate how much of our price movement then took place in relation to the debut of the Q1 earnings report and possible additional market factors that are opaque to us via the data we as retail investors have access to. We are seven (7), but maybe even eight (8) weeks out from an earnings catalyst and five to six (5-6) weeks out from IV appreciation thereby. While our put-to-call gamma ratios are currently trending bullish (approaching 1/3) they are not exactly as bullish as they were in May (1/4 and 1/5 at times).

With that being said, it is evident that our landscape is VERY sensitive to bullish volume. The evidence for this can be found right in the middle of our trading day at 12:37pm EDT, that conspicuously tall green candle:

[10\/17 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/24nr48ow3ivd1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63aeba82efa3b0af8be9d5087fd8b7880e3a516)

What happened at 12:37pm EDT? This is a good question. I watched this play out live yesterday and it wasn't exactly clear to me what the catalyst was. The big candle rocketed up only on about 60,000 shares of volume and it was accompanied by some concerted bullish options flow that took the price up through the VWAP +1Σ line. This wasn't enough bullish volume to skew overall options premiums in that direction on the day (which were relative to total volume decisively bearish), but intriguingly a mere 60,000 shares ($1.3mil) of concentrated bullish volume was enough to launch the stock price $0.25. That is extremely sensitive.

Maybe this mini missile was pure spontaneous options piling-in, maybe it was a decently capitalized retail whale whom the scanners didn't pick up. There was a dark pool trade right at 12:37:01, but it was only for 5,400 shares. That's about as standard a standard dark pool trade as you get and doesn't offer satisfying explanations for what caused this price anomaly. Thus, perhaps, maybe this was a whale or institution testing the water (and the degree to which Broker-Dealers are properly hedged) before we head into Friday's OPEX.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Here is where I'll take some time to talk about our December options chain structure. But, first, we'll take a peak at our closest dated OI changes in our usual fashion.

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/17-10\/18](https://preview.redd.it/jsocbvur7ivd1.png?width=1855&format=png&auto=webp&s=535d17ee8ecbb0138c9c0750719c1ba2d6ab2c5d)

As is pretty typical from a quiet day heading into OPEX, we see a lot of traders closing trades early, taking profits, cutting losses, and managing risk. Since yesterday's options flow was skewed bearish on the day, we have to assume that the majority of these closed calls were sold to close (a glance at individual contract volumes and flows does indeed confirm this). All in all, the options chain currently features about 85% of all open calls slated to expire OTM - almost 300,000 contracts - with about 65,000 puts as well. Thus, even though Max Pain is still sitting at $20, MMs have still raked in the cash on this options chain, largely as a result of the fact that this is the last options chain in 2024 with strikes running all the way to $125 - the last even past $45!

New OI for next week's weekly expiry 10/25 was still pretty light, as was new OI for our November OPEX (11/15). So, I'll take a moment to talk about the December Chain (12/20) which just went live during yesterday's trading. I'll give you a peak:

[12\/20 Monthly OPEX](https://preview.redd.it/kto2fgos9ivd1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=6221f77bb3995809d50bda4da5c4cd167de87d0f)

Notice anything? Yeah, it looks like the image is a little cut off. Except that it isn't. That's the whole options chain. It only goes from $13 up to $29. It doesn't even go up to $30!!! Now, you can see not much volume and OI has graced this chain yet - in fact ChartExchange and UW don't even display OI info yet for it, which is why I had to take this screenshot directly from ToS (my trading platform).

But, okay, why is this (potentially) significant?

So, I've spoken here often about the dynamics affecting Gamma Squeezes. This little $2 pops we've seen on four out the last six (4 for 6) Fridays are examples of this phenomenon. Sneeze 1.0 may not have been the mythical MOASS (in fact, it wasn't a short squeeze as Superstonk and the SEC investigation admitted) but it was the MOAGS - the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes - and Sneeze 2.0 (the Burp?) in May was also an example of this phenomenon.

As I have said before, gamma squeezes are the product of a positive feedback loop of Market Maker algorithmic options hedging and options traders buying (usually) long calls (but selling short puts as well). As traders open new long calls, Market Makers hedge their short call positions by purchasing shares on the open market. This happens every day. However, if options flows are particularly bullish, call-buying can force market maker hedging algorithms into a feedback loop where their own share hedging drives more calls into the money, forcing them to buy more shares, driving more calls into the money, etc.

When options chain are very spread out, this acts as a deterrent on this type of event from occurring in a compounding fashion across multiple hours and even days. The 2021 Sneeze saw exactly the phenomenon occur where call-buying was so heavy that it sent the entire call side of the options chain into money MULTIPLE TIMES on back to back days. This forced MMs to extend the chain upwards on consecutive days on the hope that they could somehow extend it far enough to offset their losses by getting enough premium from new short calls. When this failed - and it was obvious that the more call strikes they offered, the more they were enabling new waves of buyers to swoop in and pick up calls for an affordable price - they shut off the buy button.

So what does this have to do with the December Options chain?

Since May, all extant GME options chain have been extended all the way out to $125 strikes. This has meant that a huge amount of retail premium has been bet on 'cheap' Calls at $90, $100, $120, etc. However, these calls, being so far out of the money, have only and ever had extremely minimal effects on GME's price action. The probabilities of ITM expiry are calculated at effectively 0. Hence, MMs likely write these contracts naked without so much as a single share held to hedge their positions. In fact, even $30 has proven for months to be an extremely popular strike for retail to purchase OTM Calls and every dollar has gone directly to the pockets of the Dealers.

It is essentially free money.

Wait, but didn't you say December only goes up to $29? That's right. November goes up to $45 (like some other upcoming monthlies), but December's options chain CAPS OUT at $29.

Is it because the options market just isn't buying at these strikes?

Well, January 2025 is the next OPEX coming up that was available for purchase during Squeeze 2.0 in May. There are currently 11,000 Calls open at $30, 20,000 at $60, and almost 40,000 open calls at $125. So, no, they are still finding buyers and holders.

Explanations?

Maybe dealers have facilitated too many short calls at these strikes for the open market and have been forced to hold these potatoes themselves with no buyers. This is possible. But couldn't they just, I don't know, not buy them as a long party? Unless they are required by market regulations to do so as a stock's designated market maker.

Another explanation is they are stupid and negligent for passing up on free money. Lol, yeah, okay, the Street passing up on free money....

Lastly? They themselves want to concentrate December monthly retail and institutional call-buying - **and call WRITING** - at lower strikes in order to maximize their anticipated profits for that stretch.

This means broker-dealers may have noticed that the options market has turned their own over-extended options chain strategy against them to the extent that it more so transfers short call premiums to retail and institutions trading in the options market than it does to the designated Market Makers themselves (I mean, that's how I've been paying my bills since June). This options chain compression in December may lure over-eager retail and institutional writers to sell their monthlies far closer to our trading range, only for MMs to partner up with their hedge-fund arms (think Citadel) and set off a gamma ramp up through $29, only to extend the chain thereafter, draw in retail buying frenzy for the higher extremely low probability strikes, and flip the switch as the price compresses on an RCEO ATM Offering. Of course, the key here is that there would need to be a big run first for this to be exploited.

All of this might be too much speculation, but an anomaly like this puts me on alert to watch for traps. We'll have to watch how this develops keeping these big-picture dynamics in our mind.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/clo6mlmfgivd1.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9e65399f3c6d0ea191df8442126ce4bc726997

Our gamma exposure situation is a bit less speculative. This is the highest concentration of Call Gamma I have seen across three strikes since June and there is significant gamma tightly overhead at $22.50 and $23. If we have a low volume day today, we'll look like we did yesterday to a certain extent with dip late in the day that would close likely lower than $21.50, but higher than $21. Movement below that range is unlikely (barring some inexplicable bearish determination to do so).

If, however, we open somewhat neutral and the price flattens out for an hour or two, the right concentration of bullish volume could make this thing pop - and fast - to the tune of MMs scooping up millions of shares. The set-up is there. The question is, is there an institution or long whale out there that wants to make this happen? If not, we'll still stay pretty stable into the close.

**Technicals**

[8\/19-10\/15 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/dbs43l2fiivd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f796fec5a7b580ceddd9c5c788be5f3640055e94)

[8\/19-10\/17 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/qe8urn2niivd1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1093a5149fdb023dd26a3af0bd9e36f8926cfe9)

So for my doodle to have maximum accuracy and precision we'd have to have a bit of a gamma event that would carry over in T+1 Settlement on Monday. This doesn't have to occur, but yesterday's trading was so flat and IV this week so flatlined, that the set-up is there to take the price up to $22 and spill a little bit over into $22.50 and $23 territory (though we'd have to see volume probably in the 10-15mil range for an extension to reach that far).

The 50-Day SMA continues to lightly curl up. The 200-day SMA continues its steady march forward as it exchanges February and March $14-$15 values for October values of $21+. RSI is in the dead center of the channel and MACD bullish crossover is occurring presently. There is nothing technically to suggest that a little Friday run couldn't happen and, overall, that bearish-sentiment has been drying up from week to week.

Additionally, as I pointed out last night, technical trader Jake Wujastyk called attention at large to the stenotic effect on GME's price action into 10/18 OPEX:

https://preview.redd.it/onzfpth8kivd1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=937ed5dc3410681a224f30a6a0d5302d5e3bad7e

Jake is looking here at the period beginning two weeks pre- Q1 earnings report up to the present time on the weekly chart as a trend-whole. While none of this deterministic or mechanically compulsory, that he is noticing what I have also noticed through separate indicators means there must be institutions and real pros who see this as well. Something to keep in mind.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV](https://preview.redd.it/7gzokonlmivd1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2264fb09141fe3bc78b02d92a9940dcc9b2632b)

Somewhat surprising that levels are as high as they are despite the fact that our price has been so flat, but, in any case, we are still largely observing a trend that is otherwise expected considering all our contextual factors. If we pop today, our IV levels will elevate accordingly for about the next week.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

A little gamma squeeze today up through $22 (maybe into $22.50-$23 territory depending on volume) is possible, though not strictly \*necessary\*. Much of this will depend on some bigger money lighting the powder keg, but the environment is in place for this to happen. It might be worth a small (responsible, risk managed) bet for those of you who are into that sort of thing.

A little further out we have the December Options chain raising some eyebrows - are MMs trying to fleece call writers in the options market on a December monthly OPEX upward price event? We'll have to keep an eye out, as well as an eye on the possibility of a 10/29 CATalyst. Intriguingly the AIMA annual conference is occurring on October 24 in Hong Kong, just a weekend away from National Cat Day. Only time will tell!

Good luck out there!

Cheers

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

**Summary:** Writer and barista Emily Hung is tired of hearing about the great Mark Chan, the son of her parents’ friends. You’d think he single-handedly stopped climate change and ended child poverty from the way her mother raves about him. But in reality, he’s just a boring, sweater-vest-wearing engineer, and when they’re forced together at Emily’s sister’s wedding, it’s obvious he thinks he’s too good for her. But now that Emily is her family’s last single daughter, her mother is fixated on getting her married and she has her sights on Mark. There’s only one solution, *clearly*: convince Mark to be in a fake relationship with her long enough to put an end to her mom’s meddling. He reluctantly agrees. Unfortunately, lying isn’t enough. Family friends keep popping up at their supposed dates—including a bubble tea shop and cake-decorating class—so they’ll have to spend more time together to make their relationship look real. With each fake date, though, Emily realizes that Mark’s not quite what she assumed and maybe that argyle sweater isn’t so ugly after all…

**Pros:** 

* This book is compulsively readable, I started it yesterday afternoon got halfway then didn't get home until about 11pm and finished at like 12 something.
* Realistically flawed characters. 
* A very good grasp on the general anxiety of turning 30/ being in your 30s and not having your life figured out.
* A very good grasp on how people tend to treat single childfree folks in their 30s.

**Cons:**

* The actual romance. I'm so sorry but Emily and Mark's love story was realistic but really lacked on page chemistry. Emily barely even wanted a relationship.
* Mark was sooooo boring. >!We don't see into his POV until like halfway into the book and then a big portion of his POV is just about having sex with Emily.!<
* I know Emily is a writer but there was so much meta it felt like a fourth wall break CONSTANTLY. ""If I were a character in a book, readers would complain that I’m inconsistent.""- an actual line Emily says.

**Personal Gripes:**

* There were SO many mentions of being in your 30s and like getting a grey hair, pulling a muscle it started to get annoying.
* ""I’d like to have kids, but if she doesn’t want them… I’d be okay with that."" - this sentiment ACTUALLY never ends well
* This book could be described as aggressively millennial. Mentions of like Listicle websites and articles about not being able to buy a house and constantly buying coffee.
* She knows she's on a budget and yet *constantly* is going out for food and treats, I'm sorry girl get it together.
* ""She orgasms on my first thrust""
* I really wanted this to magically turn into WF where Emily comes to value herself more and her work and realize she doesn't need a man and is perfectly fine and complete without one. 

Overall while this book at certain times pissed me off to no end, I would still give it maybe 3.5 stars. This book made me *feel* which is what I want when I read. I also really enjoyed that this book did not feel like it was trying to cater to everyone, it feels like it has a pretty specific audience.

Less than 30 minutes ago. I lost my ever-loving sh!t on my youngest child (5m). Now I want to crawl out of my own skin.  I want to find a dark hole and stay there.

The school bus was going to be here a matter of seconds and he was intentionally dragging out the simple task of putting on his velcro shoes. For context, he'd been sitting on the floor for over 5 minutes intentionally moving in slow motion because I told him multiple times he needed to move master. His siblings were waiting outside for him so they could go to the bus stop. This is not unusual behavior - he is the youngest of four children, and he tends to push boundaries when he can. However he usually snaps out of it once he realizes I am starting to get agitated. This time I went from annoyed to furious in a matter of milliseconds. Shouted his full name. Dropped multiple f-bombs. Shoved his shoes on his feet. Slammed the door behind him after angrily shouting ""HAVE A GREAT DAY!!"" like a crazy person.

I could hear him crying through the door, and the rage immediately dissipated into an intense wave of guilt. If they weren't already late, I would have ran outside, hugged him and apologized for shouting. Now I'm just sitting here crying into my coffee. 

Cycle breaking is so hard sometimes. I know my therapist would say that it's just part of being a parent, and that even parents without a history of being abused react poorly from time to time. She would tell me that it isn't the same as my upbringing because I wasn't violent with him, I'd just mentally reached my limit. But as soon as I heard my son crying, I was a small child again. A little girl getting screamed at, berated for just doing things that kids do. At least getting smacked around made it end quicker. It was my step-dad shouting awful things at me that stung, long after it was over. I hate that I made my own child feel that sting. 

I know when they get home from school I will apologize to them all for the way I reacted. Again. I will try to explain why I reacted the way I did, and why that reaction was inappropriate. Again. I will tell that I will try to do better. Again. I will hug them all and tell them I love them. Again. 

These blow ups are not as frequent as they used to be, but I wish this was something I never had to apologize for ever again.

I would say they should get rid of this mechanic altogether, but there are some nice things about it. The buffs given by consumables such as [Ice cream] and [Coffee] rely on it a lot, and the [Warmth] status you get when interacting with another player is really nice.

Huffing and puffing around in front of customers and employees, it’s no wonder why they don’t respect her. 

I decided I can’t work for her anymore after she screamed violently at her shift manager and daughter on multiple occasions.
Honestly I felt more embarrassed for her than anything, like throw a fit why don’t you? You middle aged woman. Throwing a tantrum bc you can’t face reality of your bad decisions.
Idk I can’t surround myself with that kind of hostility.

Other than that
The place is filthy, dust bunnies and crumbs everywhere
Bathrooms haven’t been cleaned the whole time I was contracting with them, and still aren’t
The BOH, a complete shit show. I organized several times to keep it clean and she would come in with a new hoard and just blow the house down again! I can imagine her home is probably at least a level 7 hoard.
Anyway, good luck finding a mop, if you do want to clean.

I addressed the concern of the stores appearance, as a customer, but it is clear cleanliness is not a priority. I wouldn’t eat here anymore knowing that and I just can’t support a person who results to screaming when they don’t get their way.
Feel welcome to write a Google review on my behalf to take this bitch down.

The funniest part is she will brag about the many careers she’s had as an llc, but when I hear that knowing what I know it’s actually sad because she clearly doesn’t have any real experience having never followed through with anything.

Anyway-Didn't hear from her for a few days,  then saw that she had gone out with her girlfriends to some winery, etc. I was cool with it since I am not on the top of the totem pole for her. I know she needs to grab some good times with her friends whenever it lets her. 

Alot of you said to reach out to her and all that. So I texted her again, and said that I saw on my feed of her having a good time and looking like she was feeling better. And asked if we could meet up for coffee since I missed her. And she responded back that she was glad she was feeling better for a short while so she got to go and have a good time since she sometimes misses out on so much etc and she was up for meeting for coffee.  So I asked, do you want to go grab some later today. And she said she already had plans with family in town but lets do it another time. . So I said no problem. We can go later because there was a coffee place that I wanted to take her to.  Then I did my usual morning texts that she liked. She responded back. Then Wednesday night, asked when she would like to grab coffee to try to finalize something concrete.  Nothing.  

Sigh. Oh well. Hopefully I hear back from her since I do like her. This sucks!

I started reading QC around #1200 or so.  I don't remember how I found it, but it was fascinating.  I wanted to know more about these characters, they registered with me, drew me in.  I spent hours in one weekend reading it from the beginning to catch up.  My wife was wondering what the hell I was doing on the computer all day.   Every morning, I get up, feed the dogs, sit down to eat breakfast, and read the new QC.  Every day.  For four thousand comics. 

 Then the other day, I get up, get breakfast, read the comic, and am greeted by ""Zoltan"" interrogating a stranger about railing his daughter-in-law, and Mom's not much better.  This, in the middle of the shittiest story arc since Tilly.  ""What the fuck,"" I said.  Totally involuntary.  What. The. Fuck.  A new low for the comic.  I read it again.  No mistaking it.  Possibly the comic's lowest point to date, #5418.  I checked to make sure it was the actual comic, and not a edit.  Nope.  It's legit. I can picture Jeph cackling as he wrote it down.

So, I got up this morning, let the dogs out, sat down to breakfast, and didn't read the new comic.  I don't care about Hannelore or Faye anymore.  Every male character is now a pussy.  Martin is an animated corpse and also a pussy. Claire is an insufferable know-it-all.  Bubbles is totally irrelevant.  Tai and Dora can go fuck themselves.  Everyone just forgot about Yay, I guess, and the goth twins aren't fun, they are just off putting.  Every conversation and everyone's entire life revolves around how gay/bi/lesbian/transgender/goth they are.  And now we're opening conversations with new characters about how good you fucked my daughter-in-law.  And it is so dull.  And there is no story.  And I miss my old pal, Yelling Bird, and his beautiful cloaca.

So, here's how it really wraps up folks:  Marten and Claire move to Cube Town.  Claire was very successful in her role, eventually getting a seat on the board of Cube Town.  Married to her work, her relationship decays.  Martin lost a lot of money on trying to open a coffee shop without guidance and fails, having  never served a single cup of coffee.  He borrowed a bunch of startup money from Claire, and couldn't pay it back.  They broke up, Martin moved home, and got a job working UPS.  He delivers a lot of parts to Union Robotics and they remain fast friends.

 Faye and Bubbles become prosperous.  After legalization of robot fights by Mayor Crushbot (see below) they begin advertising that Bubbles was champion.  Soon, the robots of Northhampton don't trust anyone else to work on them.  The two stay together, but don't talk to Tai and Dora much.  It's awkward when they go to the coffee shop.  When Faye dies of liver cirrhosis some years later, Bubbles goes into non-profit robot repair in a partnership backed by Marigold.  Dora and Tai don't find out about Faye's death until some weeks after.

During a routine checkup and Union robotics, it is discovered that Pintsize has a solder bridge in his CPU caused by dripping grease from an errant vienna sauage.  No one knows how it got there.  Cleaning it changes his circuitry completely, and he is now able to go more than one comic without making an obvious vulgar joke.  Being too infamous in Northhampton and feeling restricted by how everyone knows him there, he moves in with Liz in Cube Town, and gets a job clerking at the library.  Having somebody to live with really helps Liz turn around, and her research picks up.

Aurelia's ""Mommy Milkers"" runs it's course and the internet moves on.  Aurelia hasn't made any permanent new friends, and remains very lonely.  She spends too much time penning long theoreticals about webcomics on reddit.  She wonders why she goes on living quite a bit, especially after Cosmo passes away of old age.

When Yay ran out of the nightclub, Yay was grabbed by a dark ops team and thrown into a faraday cage in the back of a van.  Similar teams were busy doing the same to all known Yay instances.  Presumably the government did this to recover an escaped AI tech.  All physical instances are destroyed and after some reprogramming Yay is put back to work in surveillance, espionage, and sabotage for the NSA.  None of the comic characters ever hear of Yay again or discover Yay's fate.  Yay does not remember Yay's former life.

When Jim and Veronica decide to move, they lease-to-own the Secret Bakery to Clinton and Elliot.  These two stay together and are happy running the bakery.  Elliott develops a line of baked goods specifically for AI's to smell, in a similar way they do at Coffee of Doom.  Soon, these products are being sold all over town.  They eventually have a surrogate child, who Clinton stays home to raise and they visit Aurelia a lot.  This helps take the edge off her loneliness.  

The AI population of Northhampton and the region continues to explode as the technology develops, and as heterosexuality almost entirely dies out.  It doesn't turn into robot thunder dome, but you just don't see many humans around any more.  The remaining humans look around at all the robots sometimes and wonder if something wasn't lost.  Crushbot is elected mayor on the promise of ""Making Northhampton Crush Again,"" which no one takes seriously as a threat until it is too late.

TLDR:  You didn't miss much.  Don't worry about it.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

My wife loves it. Now I'd like to gift her another one, but way more compact, that uses quite a lot less space.  
I've checked DeLonghi, Gaggia, and Sage and I can't seem to find a model that fits these requirements.   
Are there any recommendations? For reference, we are in the European Union (Portugal).  
Requirements:  
1 - Must be really compact.  
2 - Must be very good for an espresso or double espresso.  
3 - We don't care about milk drinks.   
4 - Water compartment can be very small, even 0.5 liters would be fine.  
5 -  Must have a coffee bean grinder and compartment for beans.   
6 - Also accepting ground coffee is optional.   
7 - She drinks just one espresso in the morning. So ability to produce multiple shots at once, or producing many shots in sequence is not important.   
8 - Screens are not important.",1,1729256687.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

(I feel awkward saying this online, please bear with me)

My whole life I felt out of place and autism has just come into my radar. My best friend got diagnosed recently and it got me thinking about many things about myself I deemed as ""normal"" (I just thought I was ""weird""), and my parents have been pointing out things I used to do as a kid that caught my attention having learned a little bit more about people on the spectrum.

I'm not sure how to approach this - I would like to get a professional diagnosis and I already go to therapy (anxiety, depression and PTSD - but now I wonder) but I'm too scared to talk to my therapist about it and them saying I'm faking it for attention or special treatment or something (I've heard this a lot with my current diagnosis from my family).

I'd like to point out a few things that I do and thought about, and feel free to share your experience being a woman and masking/dealing with impostor syndrome. (I'll write these down as they come to mind)

- I hate grass and sand and dirt and any flooring that has texture - As I kid I never played with other kids in school, in the playground, or anywhere else because I was both disgusted and terrified by those things, so much so that if I had to get near it I'd scream and cry out of sheer terror - still hate it to this day, it makes me deeply uncomfortable but I just never get near it, CANNOT TOUCH IT

- I always had ""anger fits"" as my parents called them, for no apparent reason - now I know if anything goes slightly different in my routine I get really angry and sad, it feels so violating and disruptive in my day (like driving to work and having to take a different route or not having the dinner I had planned). As a teen I was diagnosed with anger issues by one therapist and the other said I was just a rebellious teenager (I never did anything wrong or illegal and I have no desire to to so lol)

- I've always had fixations on time periods and countries. I'd get obsessed over one very specific historical event, era or country - I'd exhaust every source of information and fully embrace it - I learned to sew to make my own historically accurate clothing, learned the way of speaking, read the books people were reading at the time, listened to the music, and only that. I also learned a few languages doing this but I just thought I was skilled and had a passion.

- Food and fabrics textures? I hate eating hot foods like soup and stuff, I always just let my foods cool down, same with coffee and tea, I drink everything cold - but not ice cold either - and don't get me started on things like apple pie and warm fruits, it's disgusting. I already have things that are chewy like apples pears coconut and gummies. And fabrics, anything that makes a sound, silk or satin or velvet, just thinking about it I get chills. Absolutely disgusting. I can only wear things like cotton and very loose clothing otherwise I feel like I'm suffocating.

There's a lot of other things too but I just can't think off the top of my head and I'm getting tired writing this, sorry. 

If you have any similar experiences or would like to share you're own I'd appreciate very much! I'll be responding as I remember things.

TLDR: I think I'm in the spectrum but I'm too afraid to ask my therapist because I have impostor syndrome, so I'd like some opinions or experiences from strangers on the internet.",5,1729256387.0,AutisticAdults,1,1.0,False

My main trigger for worse/more frequent panic attacks is being alone. I have an undiagnosed heart condition (being worked on currently) that causes me to have sudden fainting spells, dizziness, SVT runs, lotsa different horrid things that just feed into my anxiety. However about 2 weeks ago I had the worst episode I’ve ever had. 

I don’t remember it entirely, I just have the odd fleeting moment and feeling but from what my partner saw, he thought I was totally dead, said I turned deathly pale and cold, my lips and extremities were blue, and my pulse was barely there. From what I remember of it, I just felt like someone had jammed their foot into my chest and I couldn’t breathe, and I was so cold and had this horrible impending doom, I really and truly thought I was going to die. 

Like I’ve had panic attacks that have made me think I’m dying hundreds or even thousands of times, but in a way even in those moments I can fight back, like I have the strength to kind of say ‘no I refuse to die like this and I wont’. However this was different since it wasn’t my anxiety, it was very much real and I truly felt myself slipping away.

I feel like after having anxiety over having a severe cardiac episode for all these years and then finally having one has just thrown me over the edge, the one thing I’ve been living in fear of has finally came true. I can’t talk myself down from panic attacks anymore by telling myself it’s not gonna happen and I’m not gonna die, because at this point I don’t know if that’s even true. I’ve lost every ounce of fight I had left against my anxiety, and I feel truly at a loss now as to what I can possibly do to cope.

Since this bad episode I’ve been totally unable to be alone, just too scared to be without someone watching me in case I have another episode and have nobody there to get me help. It’s totally consuming my life because I can’t be with company all the time, my partner works and when he’s not around I’ve been taking myself to the hospital with how bad the panic gets, it’s unbearable. Even with the benzo’s I was given to help me at the moment, it’s like they’re a shitty band aid that really doesn’t do much to help the wound.  

I can’t continue taking myself to the hospital whenever I’m alone, it’s costing me plenty just to get there in the first place, and also it’s just not a solution at all, I feel super bad being there and using up medical resources. 

My thought is I need to find a better place to be in these moments. Somewhere I can go that has people, but not too many so it’s loud or overwhelming, but enough that there’s always at least one or two people nearby. Also it’s gotta be somewhere I could sit for a few hours and it be okay. Like I did think about going to a coffee shop or something but I can’t spend too long there really, or a library but same thing there, I don’t really know if I can sit in one all day. 

What I’m trying to say is I’d appreciate any suggestions as to where I could go to feel safe in these moments, just anywhere that I could be. If anyone has similar struggles then please, I’d love to hear your stories also. I feel so alone right now with what I’m feeling and so lost as to what to do next. Any advice or anything at all is appreciated. Thank you

Tldr:
I have anxiety surrounding my heart condition that I’m being investigated over. My panic attacks stem from thinking I’m going to have a bad cardiac episode and die, then two weeks ago i finally had a severe cardiac episode and thought I had died.

IOW my motivation is vain but I’ve gained 40 pounds since I’ve seen her & I need to look good so I will feel better about myself. (Dumb but human!) 

That said, it’s the perfect motivator! I’ve started with a 72-hr water fast & already lost 4 pounds. I suspect tomorrow morning, I’ll lose another 2 on the scale. Then I’m switching from water to veg broths (tomato broth, celery broth) & steamed broccoli. Also lots of black coffee & warm lemon water. 

Since I’ve fasted several times this year, I’ve learned what does & doesn’t work for me. Water fasting works better than juice for me but I tend to feel icky by the 4th day, so that’s why I’m switching to broth. 

I’ve also learned that during the broth fast, sometimes I just need food to stop the discomfort, so I’ve learned that a periodic egg or toast stops the pain so u can push through it. Broccoli is also a game changer, and I go to bed early when my stomach is really rumbling & that works well to just sleep. 

I’ll keep posting my progress & this time, I’m determined! I know I won’t lose 40 pounds but even 10-15 would make me feel better about myself - & 20 pounds would get me on the dance floor.

In this post, I set out to briefly compare Secular AA and Traditional AA (by which I mean non-secular AA).  

The goal of this comparison is not to criticize one or the other; I participate in both, so I see the advantages in both camps.  To this end, let's begin by trying to dispense with -- or at least, provide an explanation for -- the existing acrimony up front.

That section grew rather long and perhaps a tad controversial to some, so skip ahead to the ""Beyond Controversy: The Pros and Cons"" section if that's not your cup of coffee.

One of Traditional AA's main out-groups is not secular AA, but rather ""normies,"" ""social drinkers"", or ""people without a program.""  You've likely heard the claim (especially popular among AA newcomers) that we are somehow superior to those outside the rooms, ""who don't work the twelve steps.""  Of course, what's often left out of this self-congratulatory narrative is the fact that social drinkers don't *need* a program to fix their lives because they didn't screw it up so badly in the first place.

Secular AA, meanwhile, was founded with all the requisite conditions for any AA group. As the AA maxim says: ""All you need is a resentment and a coffee pot.""

The resentment grew from roots that are obvious to many members of secular AA, but not so obvious from within the framework of traditional AA. 

The position of atheists and agnostics in Secular AA is like that of those ""other animals"" in the novel, *Animal Farm*.  ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.""  If I may paraphrase one recent rejoinder to me in the context of an (admittedly somewhat heated) exchange, ""Sure, the third tradition says you're a member of the AA *fellowship*, but you're not working the AA *program*.""

Even when we're not trading online barbs, the proposal that AA needs separate groups that are HP-optional may seem unreasonably extreme to someone in traditional AA.  After all, AA ""isn't a religious program, but a spiritual one."" All you need is a power greater than yourself, see?  Group of Drunks, Good Orderly Direction, Groove on Doorknobs, whatever. Surely you can make it in that way, right?  And to give this point its due, many agnostics and even atheists *do* stay sober that way just fine and don't need secular.

That said, what these well-intentioned attempts at openness miss is an understanding that some with a non-theistic bent object to being treated like immature theists, who will learn to ride the bike just fine if only the grown-ups attach training wheels. To these atheists, the more natural question arises: What has a bicycle got to do with alcoholism?

Given the Oxford Group roots of AA, it can be difficult to question the core premise that belief and recovery must necessarily go together.  It's as though some ""family values"" group had gotten together and decided that step three of their recovery program was declaring their heterosexuality. If that had happened, you could rest assured that their Big Book would contain a chapter entitled ""We Bisexuals"", in a misguided but well-meaning effort to nudge those poor folks still on the fence safely onto the side of ""sobriety"".

# Secular Tug of War

So what happens?  Naturally, atheists and agnostics who founded or supported Secular AA have tended to define their out-group as traditional AA.  The situation in secular can sometimes end up looking like the ""Great State of Texas.""  We'll lambaste ""federal overreach"" at every opportunity, but oh, yes, as to the hurricane cleanup?  Yes, send us our relief check, please. Sure, via US Postal Service would be fine.

Meanwhile, from time to time, you'll hear in Secular AA the counter-reaction: ""I don't want to hear any of this AA bashing!  Secular AA is part of AA."" This of course is correct, but sometimes lands the way any attempt to strong-arm the discussion lands in any meeting, let alone in AA.  I've seen one such discussion end up with small cliques forming an ad hoc group conscience and the subsequent business meeting resulting in one member (with 56 years of sobriety, no less), feeling excluded and leaving the group for good.

Growing pains.

## Beyond Controversy: The Pros and Cons

I sobered up in traditional AA, so for me the personal benefits have ""only"" been that it saved my life. That said, as mentioned, I now have a foot in both camps.

## Pros of Traditional AA

More generally speaking, one of the great things about traditional AA is you can always find a meeting.  For example, in the city where I live now, our local Intergroup lists perhaps 300 meetings per week, three of which (1%) are secular meetings (hosted by one group). In the small state of Rhode Island where I sobered up, I'm able to find a grand total of one secular meeting statewide per week.  So if attending lots of in-person meetings is your goal (and many would say that as a newcomer, that *should* be your goal, traditional AA can't be beat)!  That remains true even if you include other secular programs like SMART and LifeRing.  The eight-hundred-pound Gorilla of the bunch is Traditional AA.

In contrast, to get to a meeting every day in Secular AA, unless you live in New York City or somewhere equally huge, it's likely that many of these meetings will have to be online ones.  Many people do well with this format.  The main drawback, in my experience, is that computers are distraction machines, so staying focused on the discussion or speaker is easier in person.  (Also, online I have to bring my own cookies.  What's up with that?)

Traditional meetings also more often use ""Conference-Approved"" AA literature and often have more readings at the beginning and end of the meetings.  Although this can feel overly ""dogmatic"" to some, for newcomers longing for precise instructions and a structured program, it may be just what they need! Heard in a meeting: ""Sure, AA may be brainwashing, but my brain needed to get cleaned up anyway.""

## Pros of Secular AA

In Secular AA, personal experiences shine through more clearly.  It's not that people aren't diverse and have different stories in Traditional AA.  Rather, in Traditional AA, because of the emphasis on AA literature, the stories are strongly edited to conform to ""the message"" even though the Preamble tells us at every meeting that we'll hear ""experience, strength, and hope.""  You'll notice that this advantage is simply the flip-side of the structure of Traditional AA that we mentioned earlier.  Because of the relative freedom of expression there, at least one Secular AA group has labeled itself a ""Freethinkers'""
meeting.

Secular AA sometimes uses AA literature (Living Sober), but to the extent we use books at all, we often rely on outside sources.  Outstanding among these books is Jeffrey Munn's answer to the 12 and 12, *Staying Sober Without God: The Practical 12 Steps to Long-Term Recovery from Alcoholism and Addictions*. The explicit step-by-step instructions in this book make it worth a read for everyone, but of course its appeal in Secular AA is that Munn's ""Practical 12 Steps"" do not require belief in a Higher Power.  (Of course, they don't exclude it, either).  So yes, many of us are working the steps.  We just don't insist on it so much, however.

The main advantage of Secular AA, of course, is the fact that atheists and agnostics feel right at home just the way they are, removing the [Identity Threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_threat) that they may feel in Traditional AA (that I've perhaps treated at too much length above). In this respect, they fill the same type of niche as LGBTQ meetings, Women's meetings, etc. 

## Why Can't We All Get Along?

In a new book, *Supercommunicators*, Charles Duhigg argued that among all conversations, those regarding our different identities can be the most difficult. Very briefly, Duhigg's approach to this is for both ""sides"" to recognize the difficulty of the conversation but seek to engage in it skillfully nevertheless. (Much of the rest of Duhigg's book is about such skillful techniques).

That said, when you consider that some AA members may be early in their recovery journey and still terrified that a misstep may land them in a jackpot, perhaps a better question than ""Why can't we get along"" is ""How the heck is it that we manage to get along so well?""

Tradition one says ""Our common welfare should come first.  Personal recovery depends on AA unity.""

That's the first tradition, and as they say in New York, ""Not for nothin'.""

1g6h0sf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6h0sf,OUTLAW brand multi-product review - Nicotine Free Pouches and Dip ,"Alright, this is going to be a lengthy one. After a long battle with white nicotine pouches, I'm finally trying to get off of nicotine for good (other than the occasional cigar). 

I've tried numerous nicotine free pouches, and it's actually what lead me to create this subreddit because this definitely interested me... but nothing ever hit like the OG nicotine pouches. I actually gave up quitting because no replacements really did it for me. I didn't want to pay the shipping for nicotine free velo in case I didn't like it, and everything else I tried either was too dry or had sh*tty flavoring. But today that might have changed.

This is going to be controversial, because these pouches are NOT intended to replicate the feel and flavor of nicotine pouches. These are not like zyns at all. In fact, one of the three products I'm reviewing here aren't pouches at all. But hear me out...

Before pouches, I used to dip tobacco. Grizzly wintergreen, stokers mint, before my sporting events on the bus in highschool. I loved the buzz, but hated the flavor. Eventually switched to vaping for 5 years, then quit vaping with nicotine pouches... but the daily nicotine addiction is something I'm sick of battling. The reason this is important is because, if any of you aren't aware, these products are meant to duplicate TOBACCO pouches, not nicotine pouches. They are 100% tobacco free and nicotine free, but they're aimed more at previous dippers than regular nicotine pouch users.

This company is run by a youtuber who used to be famous for his dipping channel, named outlaw. I watched him around 10 years ago when I would dip tobacco, but recently realized his dip company stopped producing tobacco products and started producing nicotine-free pouches and ""fake"" dip. I wanted to give it a try because the reviews and flavors seemed tempting, so I spend around 95$ on a bunch of different styles and flavors of these outlaw products... here is my review of the first 3 I tried.

#1) Can of Joe - French Vanilla:

A large coffee pouche that contains 100mg caffeine per pouche. I didn't have high expectations for these, because I haven't liked any other caffeine pouches in general, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. Flavor is a solid 7/10. The flavoring itself is great, but the base that is used (assuming it contains coffee grounds) has a bitter taste to it that distracts me from the intended flavor of the product. The pouch feel is moist and moderately rough, with a large size (similar to usual dipping tobacco pouches, but thinner). The caffeine content felt like less than 100mg that was advertized,, but im assuming this is because I was spitting the juice and wasn't absorbing the full dose of caffeine. I'd recommend for people who love the taste of coffee, because it tastes strongly of real coffee with slight vanilla creamer background. If you don't like coffee, you will hate these pouches.

#2) Outlaw - Hazelnut Churro pouches (with nic-safe):
 All outlaw pouches are sold in two ""strengths"". Nicotine free (with zero additives), or ""nic-safe' strength, which contains added nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is a B3 vitamin found in vegetables and meats (in small amounts) that is structurally similar to nicotine and binds to the same receptors in the brain. According to toxicology research, it is non addictive and has a lot less side effects as normal nicotine, but from anecdotal experience, still supplies a ""buzz"". To me, I felt a slight body ""warmth"" from a single pouch, but I didn't really get a full buzz... or at least it wasn't nearly as noticeable as a normal nicotine buzz. But here's what amazed me... it completely kicked my nicotine cravings for multiple hours. I guess because it has a longer half life In the body and binds to the same receptors, it can keep the body from craving nicotine for longer periods of time. None of this is proven, as it's a dietary supplement for stuff like skin health but has never been tested for nicotine addiction. Anyway, back to the pouches.... well, they're again, similar to real tobacco dip pouches in size. The flavor itself was decent. Salty and sweet, not obnoxious or chemically. The pouch was moist and not too rough, similar to the cup of Joe pouch. It had maybe a slight slight burn, but honestly not much. The only negative I have to say about it was that the flavor was mostly gone in about 20-30 minutes, which was a shame because I was actually enjoying it. 

#3)Outlaw - Rambling rootbeer long cut w/ Nic-safe

This is the product that bought me over. If you haven't dipped in the past, this product will be unappealing most likely... but holy smokes, it is 5x better than I expected. First off, it actually somewhat resembles long cut dip. It's slightly more crumbly and not as ""long"" in the cut, but still convincingly similar. Next, the flavor kicks ASS. I mean, better than most nicotine pouch flavors I've ever experienced. I put a lip in of this stuff and I 45 minutes later it still has full flavor and I have no intention of spitting it out. It's made out of black tea leaves, but whatever they do to treat them makes them the perfect base for a replacement dip. Also, even tho apparently the pouches and dip have the same amount of nic-safe, I actually got a somewhat decent buzz from this product. It took about 5 minutes to feel it, but I definitely started feeling a warm tingly feeling in my body followed by a warm head pressure and mental ""satisfaction"" if that makes sense. Not as stimulating as a nicotine buzz, more relaxing, but definitely noticably different than normal caffeine pouches or completely inert pouches. If moderated, I think this stuff could actually help me taper down to the nicotine free version without nicotinamide as well. There's a really nice burn when you throw the product in for about 3-5 minutes, and a slight burn that lasts the amount of time u keep the pinch in your mouth. I'm actually bummed I bought mostly pouches and not more long cut, because this long cut stuff is absolutely amazing and blows every other nicotine free pouch I've tried out of the water... but the outlaw pouches come in a very close second place just because the first flavor I tried was really tasty and they actually kicked my nicotine cravings for a few hours, rather than caffeine pouches which actually amplify my cravings. 

Im not going to post any links, but I'll attach some pictures. The website is very easy to find and if you don't trust Google, look up outlaw on YouTube and then look in his video descriptions for a link to his companies site. This outlaw brand is now my #1 go to brand for nicotine free pouches and replacements, and if any of this sounds remotely interesting to you, go give it a try. Tins are about 5 bucks a piece, and shipping is free if you spend 60 dollars. If any of the other flavors I bought catch my attention, I'll post additional reviews later on.

Let me know if you've tried this brand and if you have any reviews or opinions. Personally, this is my new #1 and I can't believe it took me so long to try this dudes brand when I've been watching him on YouTube for 10+ years.

I decided to reply mostly 'for the plot' but I also didn't find him unattractive so l gave it a shot I guess Imao. We started chatting a bit he gave me a few compliments but then said he wasn't trying to flirt with me but 10 min of conversation later he asked if I would've liked to meet up in person for a coffee.
I found an ""excuse"" because I have to travel to go to uni so i don't really have the time plus I've never even seen him so I didn't feel comfortable yet. He trim it well and then we kept taking. Yesterday morning he texted me again and we had a conversation throughout the day and then in the evening we started chatting more abt our interests and stuff, all was going well and he didn't seem weird at all (except for the fact that he asked me a few times if he was annoying me even when I told him that if he were I wouldn't be replying to him).

I didn't want to jump to conclusions bc maybe he just means in uni and not in general or maybe he's an introvert (which l asked of course) he said that he likes to keep to himself but I didn't want to embarrass him so l just let it be and told a couple of friends who find this to be a bit of a red flag since, as I said, we don't even know what he looks like outside of instagram...

So i had a daydream about a story of a boy that moves out of the city with his family to a beautiful small town. The town had beautiful scenery that looked green and cold and had stunning, beautiful mountains and looked all fall like...

And the boy and his family lived at the top of the mountain while the rest of the town people lived under them, and they viewed the new family as mysterious and a little weird because they mainly kept to themselves. 

There was this small family owned coffee shop that was run by this lovely young man.. and also there was the mans' little brother and his friends (it's just him and his brither, their parents died..)

And the town people didn't accept the new family really well because they thought they were arrogant and snobby city people but they really weren't.. except for the two brothers who were fascinated by outsiders and thought nicly of them. And the little brother and the new city boy started to get along and maybe fell on love (??)
also there might have been werewolves or vampires or some kind of mythical creatures involved.

1g6gxd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1g6gxd9/projecting_fear_of_narcissistic_father_onto_peers/,Projecting fear of narcissistic father onto peers - resillience and nightmares,"Hi guys!

This will be a long post. Maybe somebody finds relation and peace through it :) i wrote out the background, and the point of the post is marked with bold letters. 

I'm a daughter of a narcissistic alcoholic father, and a mother who's capable of warm empathy but incredibly emotionally immature - switches places so that i'm the one parenting her, by any means neccessary (rage, crying spells, emotional/phsychological abuse). She seems to have many BPD traits, with covert narcissist ones. What i'm trying to describe, this seems to be a common romantic pairing :)

At 24 I'm a young woman now. Since I was 17 when I've witnessed the biggest scene of violence yet, I've suffered PTSD symptoms. Once I have moved out for college at 19, my brain has had shut down, I've gone through complete repession of memories, and a severe freeze stress reaction, that included my physical health too. It took me a while to realize what was going on as I had forgotten that I forgot about abuse, and for the past 3 years, I have dealt with those with consistent Gestalt therapy. I'm okay now.

So, to the current situation.

My father is a scary man, to say the least. I don't know how much of that comes from alcohol addiction, and how much from his narcissisim. It's hard to tell. With therapy, I learned that I'm ought to protect my emotions from his abuse, contrary to my core belief I should manage his behaviour to not let him hurt my mother and sister, as I was the neutral peacemaker from a young age.

Unfortunately, with that role, I have made an emotional connection with him. As he is not a psychopath but only a narcissist (hurray), he is capable of caring for someone if they fit his firm worldview, aka when care overlaps with control, which I in many ways did due to my gentle nature. At times, he has had good parenting skills, as he provided structure and help in challenging and weighted situations, like when I asked for help as a teen while depressed and scared that I'll give up and he made a doctors appointment immidiately, contrary to my mother who bought me a tea that helps sleeping and delightfully forgot anything is happening.

This had gotten me to a place of, at times, seeking safety from someone whom I'm afraid of, as my mother was, with no ill intent I hope, incapable of putting my and my sister's needs above hers.

**—----------POINT OF POST--------**

Therapy made a clear progress - I should care for that fear. I broke contact (with both parents) and felt safe for the first time in my life. But, there were consequences with that. As I started to care for my emotions, fear primary as I felt scared 24/7, that would mean to avoid other people too. Everybody and everything seemed scary, and both my mind and my body reacted accordingly. With time and careful picks of safe people, that lessened, but a good part of it stayed. 

I'm worried because my brain still doesnt seem to be capable to make a clear line between abuse and humanity. For example - this morning, my roomate woke me up by having a short fight over the phone in an another room. She's a great girl, nothing bad to say. I got scared, and usually, I would take care of that fear as a feeling and make myself comfy and safe, but that would result in me distancing myself from her as she is a threat to my true feelings.

I used to do that approach for years and find a distance with people that my brain reads as comfortable, but I just simply cannot do that anymore, to myself. In the past few months I tried a different approach, and just told myself rationally that everything is okay, the girl just argued with someone, thats what humans do, I should go back to sleep. When I got back to sleep, I had a horrid nightmare about my father.

It seems that my brain is punshing me for trying to make that distinction, between humanly faults and dangerous abuse. I will give myself time and try to work it out with my therapist, but I'd sincerely like to hear about other's experience and how you all have dealt with it.

**How long did this take for you? Did it even happen? Did you take care of it through emotion or rational standpoint, or both? How has your therapist reacted to that, have you heard good advice or exercises from them that you would like to share? Thank you :)**


TW -------the nightmare------ TW

In the dream, in our old home, he pushed himself onto some of my girl friends I brought to my room, and they were all not scared enough about it. I tried warning them, he would leave then maniacally peak from the bottom stairs, I tried to get everybody out, but they didnt took me seriously, and left only because we were late for a festival. The festival took place in my and my neighbour's yard, there were many people, and I tried convincing some girls inside the home that its dangerous to be here, but they didnt took it up, some older people seemed to take a listen but not quickly enough. I went outside to take further action, and something caught me too. I just sat on our bench in the yard, and watched the people. They seemed happy, they all had their own lives and reasons for coming. There was a rap battle going on, the girls and young women were so put together, their outfits and makeup was on point. I forgot what its like to get ready to go out. It reminded me to live too. Then I saw my father coming again. I knew I didnt have the time to call police, so I got up, froze and made myself write out everything, the adress, his phone number, what he has done that evening, on a piece of paper to give to some of the older folks I met inside to call the police. Young people were talking and pacing around me, enjoying, it was just me in the midst of it with a frozen hand that tried to write onto a faded post office note. I woke up. I shut down. I instictively made myself go back to the point of partly sleeping partly being awake, imagined the worse case scenario of him trying to r*pe somebody or myself, and me having a pocked knife in my pocket and cutting his genitals off. I got in the news paper and I stood firmly behind what I have done. Then I managed to wake up fully. This is a common turn of events for me, where I wake up from fear, but make myself go back to get the thing done and protect others from him. I drank my coffee, smoked some cigarettes, now I'm writing this post. This seemed the best way to deal with it. Hope it will help somebody else too.

Clarification: he has never done something like that, but it is a fear of mine that he is capable of it during intoxication.

There’s this guy who started following me a couple of weeks ago and goes to my same uni but not the same faculty; we don’t have any followers in common and I’ve never even seen him in uni but I decided to follow him back just to see what he would do and sure enough a few days later (Wednesday) he texted me. I decided to reply mostly ‘for the plot’ but I also didn’t find him unattractive so I gave it a shot I guess lmao.
We started chatting a bit he gave me a few compliments but then said he wasn’t trying to flirt with me but 10 min of conversation later he asked if I would’ve liked to meet up in person for a coffee. I found an “excuse” because I have to travel to go to uni so i don’t really have the time plus I’ve never even seen him so I didn’t feel comfortable yet. He trim it well and then we kept taking. Yesterday morning he texted me again and we had a conversation throughout the day and then in the evening we started chatting more abt our interests and stuff, all was going well and he didn’t seem weird at all (except for the fact that he asked me a few times if he was annoying me even when I told him that if he were I wouldn’t be replying to him).
When we talked abt some of my classes I mentioned not being able to follow all of them for the trains that I have to take and he asked me if my friends could take notes for me or share them and I said “sure they can” then he said that he has to go to all his classes and take notes himself bc…he doesn’t have friends… 
I didn’t want to jump to conclusions bc maybe he just means in uni and not in general or maybe he’s an introvert (which I asked of course) he said that he likes to keep to himself but I didn’t want to embarrass him so I just let it be and told a couple of friends who find this to be a bit of a red flag since, as I said, we don’t even know what he looks like outside of instagram…
Now he’s texted me again but idk what I should do…

 ""Alright, let's break it down. You've got a lot going on, and your prompts are all about refining strategy and creativity across different ventures. Here's a roast, but don’t worry, it’s all in good fun:  
  
""I'm crafting drip campaigns, but I'm teaching SEO and Squirrly SEO SaaS at the same time.""  
  
SEO professor meets email marketer: At this point, are we trying to convert people, or just teach them everything you know so they don't need you?  
  
""I’m targeting 300,000 entrepreneurs with an AI-driven tool showcase event—how do I make it epic?""  
  
Sure, just a small gathering of 300,000 people. Are you planning to rent out the entire internet for this event?  
  
""I’m working on luxurious tiny houses for people with limited budgets.""  
  
Because nothing screams 'luxury' like ""limited budgets."" Let’s throw in some diamond doorknobs and gold faucets while we’re at it!  
  
""I’m building a marketing campaign for tiny houses but no aggressive sales tactics. Also, I'm channeling Bernays and Ogilvy.""  
  
I love the idea, but Bernays might have encouraged people to live in those tiny houses for reasons they don’t even understand. Meanwhile, Ogilvy would probably be sprinkling the copy with ‘luxury’ and ‘live like royalty, even in 400 square feet!’  
  
""I want my email series to create urgency, scarcity, and psychological triggers—oh, and it’s for SEO tools.""  
  
Nothing makes me feel like my psychological wellbeing is at stake quite like missing out on the last license of an SEO plugin.  
  
""We’re shipping high-quality moonshine from Transylvania—globally!""  
  
Because nothing says “refined export product” like homemade moonshine from Dracula’s backyard. Will it come with a free wooden stake, just in case?  
  
""I need a Vivid Vision for AISQ. No pressure, it’s just our entire business’s future.""  
  
You’re basically asking me to pull a crystal ball out here. Just a casual peek into your billion-dollar destiny!  
  
""I’m thinking about domain names for AISQbusiness. Any ideas?""  
  
Have you considered ‘[http://Google.com](https://t.co/ZLn522Do2J)’? Oh wait, taken. Sorry, only the biggest domains for the biggest software publisher in the world!  
  
""I’m raising caterpillars in a terrarium.""  
  
Forget AI-driven marketing systems—this is where the real action is. You’ve gone from digital ecosystems to actual ecosystems!  
  
""We’re delivering fully configured WordPress sites with AI-driven marketing in 48 hours, eliminating tech barriers.""  
  
That’s two days less than it takes most people to just pick a theme. Are you secretly working for the Avengers?  
  
""We’ve got 13 high-quality software titles. But let’s focus on domain names. And tiny houses. And moonshine.""  
  
Is this software empire going to be built on a foundation of moonshine-fueled tiny houses and beautifully branded domain names? Sounds like a party.  
  
""I’m creating TikTok videos for AISQbusiness to build traction.""  
  
The real challenge will be fitting all your buzzwords into a 15-second clip. Has anyone tried doing an entire SaaS pitch with a dance trend?  
  
""I'm exploring partnerships with coffee bean sellers.""  
  
Coffee is the fuel of entrepreneurs. Are you starting a SaaS-coffee mashup? Maybe marketing automation that runs on espresso shots.  
  
""We need to promote our tiny houses for young adults on Instagram. Think global holidays.""  
  
Yes, because nothing says 'buy a house' like 'Happy International Pancake Day!'  
  
In all seriousness, you’re juggling some brilliant ideas here—everything from SaaS to SEO to luxury tiny homes with a side of coffee and moonshine. Just make sure you’re not trying to launch it all on the same day... unless you want to go viral for pure ambition!""

By the way, sorry for my English, I’m French so it’s not perfect. 
it's a long story, sorry in advance, I feel terribly sad actually and have no one to talk. ❤️‍🩹

I’m M29, and her F26. 

but basically we were together for 4 years, and we lived together for 3 years, 

I specify in advance that I had reactive abuse, or I have already kicked my ex in the leg twice between January 2023 and January 2024, never with all my strength, she never had a bruise, it would not have bruised a 10 year old child, but I still blame myself. 
I lost control those days. Moreover, I have already insulted her when she insulted me

the more time passed, the more she had intense mood swings and threats and suicide attempts. I was very worried about her, she justified these intense angers and her depression by ""I'm sorry for my words and my moods towards you, it's because of the stress of my work, it's because of the fact that my grandfather died 1 year ago, it's because of the fact that my colleagues make my life hard at work, and that I work too many hours at work"" 

then the day of the breakup, if we can call it a breakup..after having been super in love and super happy, we hug, and when I pull my arm away she screams and gets angry with me and accuses me ""why are you acting weird today?! it's like you don't want to touch me anymore! you want to leave me, you insult me! ""

I tell her that it's not true, at no time did I insult her but she tells me ""if you insulted me! If you persist in saying that you didn't do it then have me committed to a psychiatric hospital because that means I'm crazy!! "" 

then she starts throwing things on the ground, I decide to go outside, when I come back she was sleeping, I fall asleep too. 

The next day after work I want to talk to her, but she tells me ""I have nothing to say to you, you are a monster, you destroyed me for 4 years, you are the worst person on this earth, you never supported me, you always wanted me to die"" while the day before she was telling me the exact opposite, that is to say that she loves talking to me, that she wants to marry me, have children with me, that she loves me more than anyone in the world, that she has never felt so supported by someone, and on top of that I have always helped her from her suicide attempts. 

I tell her that if she thinks all this bad about me then she might as well end the relationship. She screams, breaks a cup of coffee on the floor, screams and leaves the apartment, I tell her that I have to call her parents because her behavior is unacceptable and worrying, when her parents arrive, she says ""you are not a man you need to bring my parents"" then she tells her parents to leave because it is just an argument, the parents leave but wait secretly in the parking lot

then when I find myself alone with my ex she tells me that I am a coward, and punches me several times in the face, scratches, spits, knees me in the balls, then she faints on the floor. I am extremely shocked and run to warn the parents, they find her on the floor, she is almost unconscious and she tells them that she does not want to see me anymore. the parents talk to me and tell me that they think their daughter has a problem, because it is not normal to behave like that. I decide to go to my father's for a few days, then the next day my ex's parents drop off all my clothes and are really angry with me, they also give me a break-up letter from my ex who says: ""I love you with all my being, and for the rest of my life, I'm not writing this to overwhelm you but I feel destroyed by our relationship, I think we have minimized the impact of the violence on my mental health, and today I have negative reactions towards you unconsciously, as if I wanted to make you experience all the harm you have done to me unconsciously, I hate you in those moments. I don't know if it's a goodbye or a farewell, I have to find my light again and learn to love myself again, because believe me I love you so much that seeing me hurt you is unbearable.""


the parents get angry with me and tell me that they know that I was violent with their daughter, and that they know that I owe 60k€ to their daughter (this is not true) 

I try to explain that for the money it is not true but her father is very angry and wants me to give the money back to his daughter in 5 days otherwise my ex will file a complaint for theft and for all the violence that I committed against her. 
They leave without letting me speak. 

The next day my ex contacted my best friend and told him to summarize ""I lived through hell for 4 years, I am a battered woman, 1 day out of 3 he hit me, 1 day out of 3 he insulted me, 1 day out of 3 he complimented me and was loving, he forbade me from seeing my family, my friends, I was even forbidden to go out until he had chosen all my clothes down to my socks, my nails, and my hair clip, I was never violent with him and I never insulted him, it was always him!! "" 

when it is false. 

then the father harasses me by message for 5 days telling me that if I do not return the money he will hire the best lawyer because they are rich. I had to hire a lawyer myself, who contacted the father to tell him to stop. 

then on day 10 after the breakup I contact my ex for the first time, I ask her if I can see her because I have to talk to her, at first she refuses then accepts. 

I go to see her, and I apologize to her by reading her a letter for my physical violence and insults, and she starts to cry a lot, then when I finish reading my letter she gets really angry telling me that I hurt her too much, that her family hate me and tell her that she deserves better

I wanted to contradict the lies she told her parents or my best friend by starting by telling her ""I never forbade you from seeing your family and friends, on the contrary I encouraged you to see them and it was you who didn't want to and always wanted to stay with me"" 

and she answered me ""no it's your fault, you manipulated me so that unconsciously I didn't want to see them because you are the biggest manipulator on Earth"" 

at that moment I was stunned I didn't know what to say. 

She say she doesn't know if there could be a future because she can't be proud to bring someone to her family meals knowing that her family knows that I was violent with her now, that now she wants to change her life and never see me again, she says in an angry voice that she wants to go on a trip, see her friends, get a new tattoo, that now she even does sports, that she deserves someone who knows how to love her, that now she sees these friends and talks to them more often saying that I was stopping her from seeing them when it's not true. 


then 2 days after I call her on phone call : 

she is very angry, very suspicious, she told me ""for the physical violence I could perhaps forgive you but I will never forgive you for having made my family believe that I was crazy, that I had a mental problem, I know your plan: you wanted to lock me up in a psychiatric hospital by making my family believe that I was crazy so that you could receive the money from my mutual insurance while I was in a psychiatric hospital"" 

I try to say it’s fake but she convinced herself that everything she say it’s true… 
she says that our relationship is too toxic, that it hurts her too much, that she must have someone who knows how to love her peacefully, or she says that it is over for now but for later that she does not know what the future holds, that she needs space to rebuild herself and learn to love herself again; she says that she loves me when I ask her the question and that she is in love but that she feels broken by our relationship

she says that a part of her feels that I am sincere and the other part says that I am manipulating her because she has a lot of money, and that she even wonders if I ever loved her

at the end of the call she starts to cry when I tell her that I love her but that I am aware of the suffering that I have caused her and that I cannot let myself be blinded by my feelings and tell her that I want to go back with her without having worked on my bad behavior and that's why I'm going to work with a psychologist, then when I hear her crying, she tells me she's crying, and she hangs up when I say to her ""why are you crying my dear? ""), 

then she send me 3 negative messages after the call where she says ""I don't want you to make me cry anymore, give me migraines or give me anxiety attacks, I'm 26 years old, I want to see the world, laugh and be loved every day that God makes, and I know that every relationship can have more difficult times but violence is not a passing fancy"", 

Then 1 week after the phone call there was the ring and the letter she put in the letterbox of my dad saying
 ""I gave this ring 3 years ago to the person I thought was the man of my life and the future father of my children, do with it what you want, to me it only reminds me of what I believed in so deeply""


Today it’s been 65 days since the breakup 

50 days since after I start no contact after the phone call 

And 45 days since she sent me the letter and the ring


before the breakup she got very close to her best friend, I was the one who contacted her to tell her that my ex was depressed and that she needed help and support, after that the best friend contacted her every day and called her every 2 days , when she usually called her once every 2 months. 

Just before the breakup, my ex started drawing some Disney things like her best friend, and since the breakup she created a private Instagram account, without a photo (at the time I looked) and in her profile picture I saw that she curled her hair exactly like her best friend still the day before the breakup when she splits up and hits me, and paints me in black like an abuser and she a battered woman.


I was in contact with her best friend the last 3 weeks before the breakup, I kept her informed of my ex's worrying behavior and worrying mood, she was very concerned and we teamed up in secret in order to support my ex as best we could and trying to convince her to see a shrink, unfortunately the best friend totally believed my ex and everyone on her side thinks I'm a monster. my ex also told me the last time that I I had on the phone « I saw all the messages with my best friend! You're a liar!"" I could forgive you for the physical violence, but I don't think I could ever forgive you for the fact that you contacted my family and my best friend by inventing a story so distorted from reality just to get into your ""You mean, you did that to make me look crazy, you wanted them to believe that I had a serious mental illness so that you could lock me up in a psychiatric hospital!""

I must point out that 2 week ago my mother see her in the street, my mother told me that they looked I must point out that 2 week ago my mother see her in the street, my mother told me that they looked at each other but didn't say hello, and my mother said to me ""honestly Ryan, when I see her in the street 2 weeks after the breakup (2 days after she sent me the ring and the letter) she seemed fine. 

but there, it looks like it wasn't her! 
Usually she doesn't wear much makeup, but there she was covered in makeup. 

and I saw from her face that she wasn't well at all, she looks worried, sad, very strange, it's not the face of someone who is happy, she seemed to have problems in my opinion, after that it's maybe because she was surprised to see me. "" 

but then when my mother said that, I went on Google to type in her first and last name, because my ex is an osteopath, and she was supposed to open her own practice a few days after the breakup, (I help her a lot to organize all the things to open that before the breakup) on September 1st, and the breakup happened on August 15th. 

and for your information I knew that she had not worked at all since the breakup because she only opened the practice on September 25th. 

so I went on Google and I saw that she had received 1 review, to my great surprise I saw that her practice was rated 1/5 stars. 

I looked and the review was dated 2 days before my mother met her in the street. 
The review said :
""good first contact when making an appointment on the phone, she gave me an appointment on Monday and Wednesday, on Monday I went to the practice and to my great surprise it was closed. I decide to call the osteopath, and she doesn't answer, I waited 1 hour in front of the office and no news from her, still no news on Wednesday, I decide to go anyway and I see that the office is still closed. My back problems thank you! You are not a serious person, you give appointments and are not even there, on top of that you do not answer to postpone the appointment or apologize. »


Can I have your opinion ? It’s my fault ? Do you think she will come back ? Do you think it was right to not answer her 3 negatives messages after the call and to not answer to her gesture of the letter and the ring after the beginning of my no contact ?
Do you think she is in a bad mood actually ? 
Do you think she is not regulated ? 

Why she send me the letter and the ring 1 week after I enter no contact ?

The next day, I was on a call with a different group. This group is typically more mindful of what is going on in the state. Zero mention of the hurricane or resources or anything. I reached out to them, because I thought I missed something storm related (kept cutting in & out). Nope... The next day someone from there sent me an email with a link to GEMA. 

I've spoken to several people who didn't realize that it was so bad or that we were without power for so long (there are still folks in Coffee & Jeff Davis Counties without power). Our county is still mostly without internet services & for some reason our cell services have been in & out since the storm. There are still intersections in town without working lights & debris cleanup will be ongoing for weeks or months. 

I know it hit mostly rural Georgia, so it's not a huge portion of the state population... but, if you're interacting with anyone from the path, please be mindful that it's completely turned our lives upside down.

I have a day porter so one single person I manage. I let her do whatever she wants as long as she does her task. She is Hispanic and I am not.  I let her speak to me in her language so she's comfortable plus I understand very well just can't respond with a quickness.  Moving on . She is cool with the property cleaning crew (they stick together) that's fine ! Just dont come in my suite and distract her from her work.  I allow the cleaning people to chill have a coffee take a breather in my suite. I share any leftover catering etc with them always respectful ! 

Would you belive my day Porter and 3 of the property cleaning people sat 7 ft away from my calling me derogatory names in their language 🤔  the same people who only speak Spanish to me and I respond in English. I was baffled.  

I went and found a Spanish speaker and tore into everyone's ass! How dare you disrespect me in MY SUITE when I've only been kind? Word got around quickly now they won't even come in here unless I put in a ticket. 

I'm angry. Why do these kinds of people exist. ",1,1729253931.0,venting,1,1.0,False

For the past 18 months, I've made it a point to put any coins I have in my pocket at the end of the day into a large metal can, sort of like a big coffee can. It's now completely full and I'm sure I have at least 100,000 yen in there, possibly closer to double that. There's no way the random change machine at Family Mart will handle that.

I'm wondering if the bank machine will take it, but as my bank closes at 3pm while I'm at work and is never ever open on weekends, I'm a bit hesitant in case the machine jams and there's nobody nearby to fix it.

Any suggestions?

""Final comms buoy placed, sir,"" the isolan sensor tech said. ""It's coming online now.""

""Good work, Gofsun,"" Henskin said. ""Sir?""

Henskin and I made eye contact, and the briefest of smiles played across his features. My frown only served to deepen his smile. We had made a bet to see who could figure out the isolan's name first, without looking it up or asking directly.

The bet was a foolish one for me. Henskin is not only more sociable than I am, but also of a rank that requires frequent interaction with the rest of the crew. Now, the coffee pot would have to stay in the mess for three whole days. I glanced at the elixir-producing device that was currently mag-locked to the floor next to my seat.

""Yes, excellent work,"" I said with a carefully neutral tone. ""Once connection is established, perform the standard security checks and let Overwatch know that we've made it with no issues.""

Henskin stared at me. I glared back, and took a sip of my coffee. The cogs in his head were turning, trying to find a way to bring up the bet. To take away the thing dearest to me.

""Sir..."" He began hesitantly.

""Fine. You can fucking take it,"" I growled. ""But, so help me, if I find that you cheated somehow the combined forces of all the gods of every species to ever exist won't be able to save you from my wrath.""

Henskin stood and walked over to my seat with exaggerated formality. He stood next to the coffee pot, snapped to attention, saluted, then bent over and disengaged the mag-lock. He lifted the contraption with a grin on his face.

""Posture and poise, sir,"" he said.

I feigned a lunge and he jumped back, laughing. He jogged to safety, and left the bridge with the coffee pot. As the doors closed, I let out a deep sigh.

""So what are we seeing?"" I asked the sensor technicians.

""No activity anywhere nearby, even relatively speaking,"" Lieutenant Gofsun reported as a grid appeared on my terminal.

The grid was a 2D representation of our tactical coordination system, as viewed from the positive Z axis. Very useful for mapping, less useful in a fight where you need to know the relative position of your enemy. I prefer to use the tac-map, but the techs were having trouble learning how.

Each of the tiny squares on the thousand by thousand grid represents one light-year. The nearest marker was at least one hundred and fifty light years away. I wouldn't exactly call that far away, but relativity is relative, I suppose.

The Republic isn't as advanced as the United Systems, so even little things like distance have different expectations attached to them. So Gofsun's probably right, by Republic standards. Something about the map struck me as strange, though, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it...

""Are we still in deep space?"" Yorvi asked. ""I'm not seeing any nearby stars.""

There it is. This map represents an area of one million light years squared. The odds of not seeing a single star-system feel like they should be low.

""Omega, what are we looking at?"" I asked. ""Where are the stars?""

""I don't know,"" the AI replied. ""Even if we were between galaxies, it isn't typical to run across an area of space this large without any celestial bodies in it. But that's based on the portion of the universe we've observed thus far. It's possible that things are simply more spread out here.""

""Dead space,"" Bon muttered and shuddered.

""Regardless, we need to get an idea of what the Omni-Union is up to out here. Inform the carriers of our intentions and let's go peeping.""

""Aye aye, sir!""

A bustle of activity spread throughout the crew as I chose a section of the map with what appeared to be the least amount of enemy activity. It's best to ease into things, especially since we have a lot of new faces. Better to run from a thousand than a million if someone makes a mistake.

It would have to be one hell of a mistake, though. The designer of this ship definitely knew what makes a ship visible and did everything they could to make the Strandhogg the opposite. They'd even painted the hull black, which is hilarious.

As I was ruminating over the comedic nature of how overdone our stealth was, Henskin reentered the bridge and marched up to my chair. I regarded him coldly, as he had just made my life that much more difficult by halting my easy access to coffee. With a grin, he snapped to attention and saluted.

""Sir, the coffee pot is stowed away in its proper location,"" he said.

I let him stand there with his hand on his forehead for a few seconds before halfheartedly returning his salute.

""Very good, Henskin. Return to your duties,"" I growled.

""You know, you could just file form 210.68-56G and have the coffee pot officially transferred to the bridge,"" Omega said just loud enough for the two of us to hear.

Henskin and I stared at each other, and our expressions swapped. His devilish grin dropped into an angry grimace and my angry grimace rose into a devilish grin.

""The bet, sir,"" he said in a carefully measured tone.

""The bet, Commander Henskin, was that the coffee pot would, and I quote, 'return to its rightful place'. If I file this form, its rightful place will become the bridge.""

""Damn my inherent eloquence.""

""Indeed.""

""But, sir, we both know that such an action would not be in the spirit of the wager. You made a bet and lost, and as such should lose something.""

""Ah, but one of the core concepts of betting is outwitting one's opponent. Whilst you have performed the feat that the wager required, your demand was made in such a way that it can be avoided. Should you not face some form of loss as a result of this oversight?""

""Good to enter warp, sir,"" a slightly confused Lt. Commander Yorvi said.

""Go on,"" I replied with a nod.

""While that may be the case, sir, I'm afraid that in a bet between two officers the first and foremost thing that must be observed is honor,"" Henskin explained as he returned to his seat. ""Especially since seeing you, the captain of our vessel and the paragon of our crew, swindle your way out of a bet may harm crew morale.""

""Where did you learn the word paragon?"" I asked, narrowing my eyes.

""Word-a-day calendar, sir,"" he replied with a grin. ""My point still stands, though.""

""Fine. A compromise, then. A day and a half, then I file the form.""

Henskin thought about it for a moment, then shrugged nonchalantly.

""Deal, sir,"" he said as we exited subspace.

My eyes darted to our read-outs. The burst of radiation from our FTL jump was properly absorbed and distributed by our hull. It shouldn't be a matter of concern because we're also outside of the projected sensor range of the OU, but one can never be too careful. Invisibility is our only advantage over the enemy, and to give it up is to invite disaster.

""Alright, what have we got?"" I asked once the sensors came online.

""Not all that much traffic, sir,"" Gofsun reported. ""Looks like the bulk of our readings are space stations.""

""Roger that. Let's watch for a bit and figure out what they're up to. Ensign Likjo,"" I shook my empty mug. ""If you would be so kind.""

""Aye aye, sir,"" the ensign chuckled. ""My thanks to the commander for returning my role as The Supreme Fetcher of Caffeinated Beverages. My role as head of maintenance can feel so unfulfilling at times.""

""The Supreme Fetcher of Caffeinated Beverages is likely the most vital role on the vessel,"" I nodded solemnly as Henskin rubbed his temples. ""And you do excellent work.""

""Thank you, sir,"" Likjo saluted, playing into the bit. ""I will return post-haste with a mug of glorious coffee.""

""Am I going to have to listen to this exchange every time you need a drink, captain?"" Henskin asked.

""Guess you should be careful what you wish for, commander,"" I grinned.

Henskin muttered angrily about monkey paws while I watched the display. Large ships that were obviously built for cargo were attaching and detaching themselves from the OU stations. The only other ships in the area were auto-flagged as close matches to the OU military vessels we'd previously encountered.

""Manufacturing,"" I said absentmindedly. ""With some guards.""

""Looks like it, sir,"" Gofsun replied. ""If we get a bit closer, we should be able to tell what they're making.""

""Risk of exposure?""

""Low.""

""Yorvi, bring us in,"" I ordered.

""Aye aye, sir,"" she said.

A moment later, we were much closer to the stations and their guards. Well within range of their sensors, and just inside the maximum estimated range of their weapons. I took a deep, soothing breath and reminded myself that they might as well be blind.

Before I could ask, several images popped up on my terminal. Detailed outlines of weapons and robots. Some of the robots were quite large, but the humanoid ones were about the size of a gen-alt. The guns weren't particularly noteworthy, just directed energy weapons that were a couple of generations behind our own.

""These VI platforms are different than the ones that were encountered on Earth,"" Omega noted. ""The bipedal bots have more advanced power systems and armor. The mechs, for lack of a better term, are new as well.""

The mechs in question were roughly four meters tall and vaguely tank-like. Four legs ending in balls supported a two meter thick trunk which was topped with an eight armed torso. These arms were evenly spread around the torso, reminiscent of an octopus.

""Can we get a read on what they're made of?"" I asked.

""Yes, they're heavily armored,"" Omega answered. ""More competence went into this design than any other design we've seen from the Omni-Union thus far.""

""AP or AT?"" Henskin asked as the smell of coffee perked me up.

""Definitely going to need anti-tank measures against these, but armor-piercing rounds may cripple them with some well-aimed shots.""

""Here's your coffee, sir,"" Likjo said as he passed me the freshly filled mug.

""Thanks, ensign,"" I gratefully accepted the coffee. ""Alright, let's see if anything interesting happens. Remember to compile a report, Gofsun.""

""Aye, sir,"" the lieutenant replied.

We waited and watched as the Omni Union ships went about their tasks, taking careful note of the ship's comings and goings. To pass the time, the crew engaged in idle conversation. I did my best to tune them out while I drank my coffee and watched the enemy, but caught the occasional fact here and there.

Yorvi and her husband were looking at buying a domicile on Mars where they could raise some kids once her term was up. Gofsun's husband was helping their daughter with her higher education exams, and he bragged about how well they were going. Henskin and his ex-wife were considering reconciliation, because neither of them have been able to find a good match. Bon's collection of gont unification war memorabilia was close to completion, but the last few pieces of weaponry were very expensive. I didn't bother clarifying how the conversation turned in that direction.

An hour later, nothing had changed. New ships came in with forged materials for the factories, old ships left with mechs and bots. The guards stood vigil and watched, just as we were.

""Alright, time to move on,"" I said. ""Get that report sent and get us to the next cluster of enemy activity.""

""Already?"" Henskin asked. ""Thought we'd be here for another seven, sir.""

""Negative,"" I shook my head. ""We're on a crunch. Need to know as much as possible as quick as possible. Let's move, people.""

""Aye sir!""

As the Strandhogg began turning, Gofsun's report popped up on my terminal. I scrolled through it, confirmed that there were no errors, and sent it off. A moment later, we were back in subspace.

The crew was getting more comfortable with each other, and while we were in subspace they started chatting again. It's always interesting to watch the social dynamics of those who are forced into close proximity with each other under the banner of a common purpose. I finished my coffee and put the mug in the sterilizer as we left warp.

""Anything fun?"" I asked.

""Looks like a similar set-up as before. Bunch of stations, but more ships than last time,"" Gofsun replied. ""Exponentially more.""

""Not getting power readings from a good portion of these ships,"" one of the other sensor techs reported.

""Well, looks like we found a ship manufacturing depot,"" I said. ""Let's get settled in. The brass wants extensive documentation on this one.""

""Really? Why?"" Bon asked.

""Trying to guess what the brass is thinking will have your head spinning in no time,"" Henskin laughed.

""If we know how the ships are built, we know how best to take them apart,"" I said, ignoring Henskin. ""If their manufacturing process has a flaw and we're able to identify it, we're able to exploit it. The easier it is to destroy their ships, the more ammo and lives we save.""

Bon raised squinted an eye, a gesture similar to a human raising an eyebrow, and glanced between Henskin and I.

""Commander, the captain's head doesn't appear to be spinning,"" he said.

""That's because he's one of the brass.""

""Ah, I see. Thank you, commander.""

I let out an exaggerated sigh and leaned back into my chair. One of the more common jokes made about me is that I'm secretly a member of the admiralty. In truth, it's just not that hard to guess at the reasons certain orders are given. Once you understand the relationship between action and consequence-

A flicker on my terminal caught my attention. I studied the map, trying to figure out what had happened. Everything looked normal, except for a marker in the upper right corner. What it was showing was so ridiculous that I couldn't even process it for a few moments.

""Sir, we have an... uh... anomaly,"" Gofsun reported.

""A glitch?"" I asked.

""No, sir. That's what we suspected it was, so we reset the sensors. It's still there, so...""

Gofsun trailed off, then shrugged.

""How many resets did you do?""

""Four, sir.""

I stared at him, then looked back to the map. We were still too far away for a detailed scan, but this was definitely going to need to be our next stop. The markers were accurate with a margin of error of plus or minus a quarter of a light-year. It's entirely possible that this is a glitch due to the position of the enemy.

Except that at least one of the resets should have resulted in the marker separating or moving. On rare occasion, the same error could happen twice in a row. Three times in a row was damn near unheard of. Four times? Impossible.

""What is it, sir?"" Henskin asked.

Instead of explaining, I twisted my terminal in his direction.

""I don't... Oh. What the fuck?""

""Posture and poise, Henskin,"" I said.

I turned the terminal back to its original position and stared at the marker that was taking up two squares on the map.
