Between chapters, I lean back and let the lights glow through my window — quiet, soft, and strangely hopeful.

**About me:**

* Fun-sized at 5'1 (airplane-window seats love me)
* Morena
* Love language:
   * What I give well: Physical Touch, Quality Time, and Acts of Service
   * What I like to receive: Physical Touch, Acts of Service, and Words of Affirmation
* I love consistent check-ins, voice notes that sound like soft confessions, late-night calls where we both pretend we’re not sleepy, and affection that’s earnest. Physical touch is my first language; words are just my favorite translation.
* Still somewhat childish

**What I seek in a partner:**

* High empathy. Kindness thrives. It’s the number #1 quality I seek in a partner.
* Strictly monogamous. I can't see myself sharing my partner with another girl.
* Purpose-driven. You don’t need to have everything figured out, but you’re actively building something for yourself.
* Passionate about something. I love listening to a man light up when he talks about what fuels him.
* Growth-oriented. Someone who wants to evolve, improve, and challenge each other in healthy ways.
* Good conversationalist. I adore thought-provoking talks about life, dreams, random hypotheses — intelligence is wildly attractive.
* Affectionate. I’m a cuddly human. Hugs, holding hands, and snuggles are absolutely welcome.
* Preferably older than me. I’m fully aware that age is just numbers, but from my own experience, things just don’t really work out with younger guys.

**Please scroll past if:**

* Silence is your default conflict tool.
* Closing distance feels like losing freedom.
* You have vices.

If you feel that we are a good fit for each other, do reach out. Who knows we could be soulmates? You’ll never know until we get in touch with each other.

1pc4u31,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pc4u31/9_daily_habits_secretly_destroying_your_brain/,"9 Daily Habits SECRETLY Destroying Your Brain (Backed by Science, Not Influencers)","It’s wild how many of us unknowingly do things every day that mess with our brain  not metaphorically, but literally hurt how our brain functions. I kept seeing “brain hacks” pushed by influencers who clearly never read a neuroscience book in their life. No, drinking mushroom coffee alone won’t fix your memory. This post pulls from actual neuroscience, psychology, and research-backed resources because most people don’t realize how much control they really have over their cognitive health. You’re not doomed. You’re just not informed yet.

Let’s talk about the subtle daily habits that are slowly wrecking your attention span, memory, mood regulation, and even long-term cognition.

The first big one is Lack of sleep. I know, you’ve heard this before. But sleep deprivation doesn’t just make you tired, it literally shrinks your brain. The study ""The Brain Effects of Sleep Deprivation"" published in The Lancet Neurology showed that even moderate sleep loss impairs attention, working memory, and emotional regulation. Chronic sleep deprivation is also linked with long-term risk of Alzheimer’s, according to neuroscientist Matthew Walker (his book “Why We Sleep” is peak required reading).

Next: Doomscrolling. Your social media habits aren't just draining your time, they’re rewiring your reward system. A 2023 study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that adolescents who checked their phones habitually had significant changes in their brain’s sensitivity to social rewards  meaning your brain gets addicted to low-effort dopamine. Over time, this messes with your ability to focus on tasks that require deeper thinking or delayed gratification. It’s not your fault that it feels hard to read books or do focused work. Your brain’s being conditioned to avoid boredom at all costs.

Something else most people never question: bad posture. Sitting with poor posture for hours? That’s real brain damage territory. According to research summarized in the journal BioMed Research International, poor posture restricts blood flow to the brain and increases cortisol  the stress hormone that kills neurons when it's chronically elevated. The body and brain are not separate systems.

Also, skipping meals or going on these extreme intermittent fasts people love (but don’t understand)? Low blood glucose kills concentration and over time can impair hippocampal function. The hippocampus is your brain’s memory center. Harvard Health reported that low-carb or overly restrictive diets can actually increase anxiety and brain fog. The idea isn’t to eat constantly, but starving yourself in the name of “biohacking” is not helping your productivity.

Here’s a big one: multitasking. It's fake productivity. Dr. Earl Miller at MIT calls it a myth  your brain can’t truly focus on two tasks at once. It just switches rapidly, which burns energy and lowers IQ temporarily by up to 15 points. You’re actually training your brain to be worse at focusing.

One underrated danger? Chronic noise. If you constantly have background noise  TV, podcasts, traffic  your brain doesn’t fully enter rest states. The WHO released findings showing that long-term exposure to ambient urban noise contributes to cognitive decline and sleep disruption. Silence isn’t a luxury, it’s medicine. This is why apps like Endel are blowing up: they use AI-generated soundscapes to create auditory environments that soothe your nervous system. It’s not woo-woo  it’s clinically backed. Try using Endel before bed to recalibrate your overstimulated brain.

Speaking of overstimulation, overuse of stimulants (like caffeine) is another one. One coffee? Fine. But three energy drinks and a double espresso before noon? You’re frying your dopamine circuits. Andrew Huberman talked about this in his podcast  too much caffeine increases baseline cortisol, which leads to emotional volatility and sleep issues. It becomes a vicious cycle. One good app to help you reduce and track caffeine is Zero. It’s mostly used for fasting, but the caffeine tracker and circadian rhythm features are super helpful.

Another app I’ve started using is BeFreed  a personalized audio learning app built by AI researchers from Google and alumni from Columbia. It recently blew up on X with over a million views, and for good reason. You type in what you want to learn  like how to improve focus or understand dopamine loops  and it pulls from top books, expert interviews, and peer-reviewed papers to generate a podcast-style lesson just for you. 

What I love is the Focus Mode, which builds an adaptive plan based on your goals and even includes deep dive sessions up to 40 minutes long. You can pause mid-episode to ask questions or go deeper, and it responds in real time. It’s helped me replace social media time and I’ve noticed way less brain fog and better recall. If you’re serious about unlearning these brain-damaging habits, this app makes the process way more engaging.

Then there’s the sedentary lifestyle. It’s not just a physical problem. According to a report from the University of British Columbia, regular aerobic exercise actually increases the size of the hippocampus. Movement = memory protection. A short walk boosts BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which acts like ""fertilizer"" for your neurons. So even 20 minutes of movement is massive for your brain.

Finally, chronic self-criticism. This one’s sneaky but messes you up. Constant inner self-judgment activates the same brain circuits involved in physical pain. Dr. Kristin Neff’s research shows that self-compassion actually boosts resilience, reduces anxiety, and protects cognitive function over time. Daily journaling using apps like Finch helps you talk back to this critical voice with structure and consistency.

If you want to dive deeper into this whole brain optimization journey and actually heal from these patterns, here’s the most insane book I’ve read lately on the topic: The Neuroscience of You by Chantel Prat. It’s a Wall Street Journal bestseller and written by a cognitive neuroscientist who makes complex neuropsych topics so digestible. She walks you through how each brain is wired differently, why one-size-fits-all advice is garbage, and how to actually identify the right habits for your own neural strengths. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about your personality, focus style, and even “intelligence.” An insanely good read, especially if you’ve ever felt like your brain just works differently.

Another one you NEED  Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist. She explains why we’re all trapped in the overconsumption loop (phones, snacks, caffeine, even workouts) and how to reset your brain’s reward system. It’s brutal and honest. Made me delete half my apps. It’s probably the best addiction psychology book of the last 5 years.

Your brain is way more adaptable than you’ve been told. Neuroplasticity is real. And the damage caused by these habits isn’t permanent. But you have to actually start treating your brain like the high-powered, fragile piece of equipment it is. And that starts by examining what you do all day, every day. Not just what you do when you feel “motivated.”",1,1764670356.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

We believe the experiences were linked with an antique piece of furniture we brought into the house. 

5ish years ago: we were all down in the basement and my dad (who is also a reiki practitioner) said he felt a weird energy and did a cleansing to move out some trapped energies from under the stairs. We also had a radon issue (since resolved), but we haven't felt strange down there since.

The past 7 days: I WFH alone all day, and was in the bathroom when I heard what sounded like someone playing a video on social media on their phones right outside my door. The sound was in Swedish (we live in Sweden), but my entire family speaks English at home (the kids don't use any social media). I opened the door, fully expecting for one of the kids to be home from school, and nobody was there.

I mentioned it to my family and they all concluded that someone walking by had connected to our speaker and accidentally played their video for 5s-10s. I denied this and even went outside to check and see if anyone was walking by, working on the neighbors' roof, etc - nobody was around.

2 days ago: My husband is WFH and I am out on a walk with the dog. Nobody but my husband is home. He said he heard a cough upstairs, but checked and nobody was there.

We have checked all closets, halls, hiding spaces for phroggers or anyone who might be living in our attic(?) there is nobody else *in* our house that we can detect.

Any ideas? No secondhand furniture or items have entered our house other than some white coffee mugs that I purchased in advance of a party. ",1,1764670187.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

These kinds of thought-leadership posts are a great way to break up promotional content.

I enjoy cooking so much that in many cases I rather spend the money on ingredients and wine and do my own thing. When we do go out to eat, we like to go to restaurants where the food is special. Those are often, but certainly not always, restaurants with Michelin stars. Kochi’s restaurant scene is a delightful microcosm of its history and culture. Whether you're craving the intense flavors of Malabar biryani, the gentle spice of a coconut-milk based stew, or a contemporary cafe experience, Kochi serves it all with an irresistible blend of tradition and modernity. When you step across the threshold, you're not just buying a meal; you're entering a carefully constructed environment designed to engage all your senses. The subtle hum of conversation, the specific lighting that makes the food look incredible, the aroma of roasting garlic or simmering spices, and the attentive service all conspire to create an escape. This is the Atmosphere—the unseen ingredient that turns dinner into an event.

Furthermore, a great restaurant excels at the art of Connection. Think about the chef who pours their passion into a signature dish, the server who remembers your dietary restrictions, or the bartender who can sense if you need a listening ear or just a quiet corner. These people are the heart and soul of the operation. They facilitate moments: the laughter shared over a perfectly crisp appetizer, the serious discussion held over a shared dessert, or the quiet comfort of a solitary meal at the bar.

In an increasingly digital and often isolated world, restaurants offer a much-needed sense of community. They are third spaces—neither work nor home—where people gather, traditions are honored, and local ingredients are celebrated. By choosing a local eatery, you’re not just feeding yourself; you're supporting local farmers, artists, and the very people who live and work in your neighborhood.

So, the next time you visit your favorite spot, take a moment to look beyond the plate. Appreciate the intentionality of the design, the warmth of the service, and the vibrant life buzzing around you. You'll realize that what you’re paying for isn't just a delicious plate of food, but a precious, human-centered experience that nourishes much more than your stomach.

We’ve all got ""that place."" The one we default to for birthdays, first dates, or just a Tuesday when cooking feels like too much effort. It might be the bustling Italian bistro with checkered tablecloths, the sleek, minimalist sushi spot, or the cozy corner café that knows your coffee order by heart. Whatever its form, your favorite restaurant is a cornerstone of your social life and a vital part of your community fabric. But why do we feel such an attachment to these establishments that goes ""beyond the menu.Think of it like a special house for eating out. You sit down, maybe with your family or friends, and a nice person brings you a menu. The menu is like a big list of all the yummy things they can make: pizza, burgers, pasta, salads, and so much more!

You choose what you want, and the talented chefs in the kitchen get to work. Soon, your warm, delicious meal arrives! No cooking, no dishes to wash at home – just pure enjoyment.

Restaurants are great for celebrating, trying new foods, or just when you don't feel like cooking. It's a fun, easy way to have a tasty meal and make some happy memories.

# The restaurant world is about so much more than just food. It's about atmosphere, artistry, community, and the stories behind every single ingredient. Whether you're a seasoned foodie, a casual diner, or a restaurant owner looking to connect with your patrons, a great dining experience is a moment to savor.

Here's a look at why we're constantly fascinated by what happens both on the plate and behind the kitchen doors.

Lighting, music, and interior design play a massive role in how we perceive a meal. A soft glow can make a casual dinner feel romantic, while vibrant colors and upbeat tunes lend themselves to a lively, social atmosphere. Restaurants can blog about their design choices, the local artist who created a featured piece, or even the playlist that sets the Friday night mood. While a restaurant might not give away the secret to their famous sauce, sharing a recipe for a popular side dish, cocktail, or simple appetizer is a fantastic way to engage.

Restaurant stories are incredibly varied, covering everything from the high-pressure world of fine dining to funny and touching moments in everyday service. They can be found in books, documentaries, and personal anecdotes.ere are countless humorous anecdotes from servers about bizarre customer requests, like the one who insisted a restaurant go to the grocery store across the lot to buy yams and make them into fries, or the customer who yelled at the manager over a few cents of change. It all started with my fetish for cast iron pots and pans. A friend mentioned in passing that   cast iron cookware – usually elusive and expensive – was available cheap, and in abundance, at a place.hat's a bit too short for me to give you a helpful conclusion! I need to know what the blog post is about to write a good ending for it.

1pc4khi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArianaGrandeSnark/comments/1pc4khi/body_shaming_and_expressing_concern_is_not_the/,Body shaming and expressing concern is not the same thing,"Getting a little candid, but I wanted to share a bit of my personal story because I feel like it's relevant to Ariana re-engaging with the idea that someone commenting on ones body is inherently crossing a boundary, invading privacy, and bodyshaming.

I struggle to nourish myself. Not because of body image, but because of mental health issues such as depression, not being taught the skills to cook or shop or food prep, as well as a lot of anxiety regarding food and my ability to tell if food is safe or not (for example, I will not touch anything that's even close to it's ""best by"" date, even when everyone around me is insisting that it's still safe and good. Another example, I don't trust myself to know if meat is fully cooked through and safe to eat, so I almost never cook meat). On top of that, I went through some rough times financially and was struggling to afford food. All of that is to say, I was \*very\* thin to a dangerous and unhealthy point.

Because of this, I ended up being hospitalized on multiple occasions after collapsing with symptoms that I could only describe as feeling like a heat stroke.

My loved ones came to me and told me that they were scared for me and felt like I needed to seek some therapeutical and medical help for my weight and relationship with food. 

I responded to this incredibly defensively. I took it as them attacking my body. I had dealt with a lot of body shaming about how thin I was. Comments like ""men don't want a bag of bones, they want something they can hold"" or just flat out being told I was scary and ugly. Being called skeletor, stick, jack skellington, etc. So when my family expressed concern, I immediately took it as them telling me, like everyone else always had, that I wasn't beautiful and that my body was something to be disgusted at.

I was also in complete fucking denial that I needed help with my relationship toward food. I had been questioned so many times about if I have anorexia or bulimia and I was very frustrated that people wouldn't believe me when I told them that I don't *like* being this thin. I've always wanted to gain weight, but I can't.

It wasn't until my psychiatrist refused to keep working with me until I got help for my malnourishment that I finally gave in and entered a partial-hospitalization program for disordered eating.

In that program, I started to accept that my loved ones weren't attacking me for my body, they were concerned for my safety and longevity. And just because I didn't have one of the ""classic"" body-image related eating disorders, didn't mean I didn't have disordered eating and a dysfunctional relationship with food. There was so much I learned about myself and the way I treated food that I didn't even realize was unhealthy and disordered until that program.

My point in all of this is to say, I understand feeling like your body is being ""attacked"" when someone makes an inquiry about your health. But I also know that people being concerned for you because of how thin you are isn't inherently shaming or attacking - sometimes it's just concern and a wish to see you get better.

We can't use ""body shaming"" as a cop out from people being rightfully concerned for our health. We are not entitled to be left alone to waste away and sink into disordered eating and not have people comment on it with concern. In fact, a lot of people with disordered eating will often use the ""body shaming"" call out as a way to get people off their back and allow them to continue to get worse and worse. They reverse things onto those expressing concern and say ""how dare you say such a thing. *You're* the one who has an issue"" as a way to deflect from their own, clear, issue and make others feel like the bad guy for trying to say something about it.

Of course, with Ariana, there is an added layer that she is a celebrity. Her body and the extreme weight loss does not just affect her, as much as she wants to pretend that it is. Celebrities influence the culture. They are looked up to by young people. They have sway and power in deciding what is ""in"" and what is ""not"". They define the beauty standard. So, while I understand why she feels like the public may not have a right to be concerned... we do. Because we're not only concerned for her, we're concerned for all the people out there who look at celebrities and see them getting thinner and thinner and think ""God why can't I look like that"" and ask ""how can I achieve that?"". We're concerned for the people who see her liking photos about how all she eats in a day is a cup of coffee and think ""maybe that's what I should do so I can look like her"". We're concerned for the people who believe her when she says that this is what healthy looks like, and feel that to be healthy, they must be bone thin. We're concerned for the people who watch her promotional content and think ""maybe I should stop putting cheese and toppings on my pizza too"".

So, no, I don't buy into this whole thing about how people are so wrong to comment on her body. I don't buy into how the public is evil for pointing out her unhealthy relationship towards food and very concerning weight loss. I don't buy into the idea that she is allowed to lose as much weight as she wants, and promote as much unhealthy ideas about food as she wants, and we just have to stand by quietly and pretend nothings happening.",4,1764669319.0,ArianaGrandeSnark,1,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the marquette golden eagles game at the al mcguire center on 12/07 at 12:00 pm. that saturday noon game time is gonna make the main lot fill up fast, so if you don't get there super early, the traffic around 12th street will be a mess.  
  
first thing's first, check out prked. honestly, this is the insider way to do it. it's an app where people near campus rent out their driveways or garages for the day, and it’s usually way cheaper than the official lots . the best part is you can find a spot a block or two away and completely skip the long line trying to get into the official structure. short walk, big time saver, and you're not battling the wells street traffic.  
  
if you want the official route, the designated spectator parking is the \*\*wells street parking structure\*\* . it's officially structure 2, located at \*\*1240 w. wells st.\*\* and is just one block west of the al mcguire center . the game day rate is typically around $10 for event parking, but always have a little cash or a credit card ready just in case of any changes at the gate . if you're aiming for this one, you really need to be there at least 45 minutes before the 12:00 pm tip-off to avoid the worst of the rush and secure a decent spot.  
  
a slightly longer but sometimes cheaper option is to use a pre-booking app like spothero or parkwhiz to grab a downtown garage spot. places like the trinity church lot or the mke parking garage (macarthur square) are only about a 9 to 13-minute walk and sometimes have better flat event rates, especially if the wells street structure hits capacity . look for spots around 8th to 9th street that are south of state street.  
  
the last resort is street parking. you can find metered city street parking on 12th street and the adjacent streets, but check every single sign carefully . the main rule for a saturday afternoon is the posted hourly limit—you don’t want to get a ticket for overstaying your welcome . since the game is during the day, you don't need to worry about the overnight alternate side parking rules, but never park somewhere without clearly reading the signs. they are sneaky in milwaukee.

I’m a digital nomad traveling around Thailand, and I’ve been thinking about a small personal project. I’m really curious about the culture here and the perspectives of the people who live or spend time in Chiang Mai.

I’d love to meet people, locals or anyone passing through. to hear a bit about your life: family, dreams, everyday routines, or whatever feels natural to share.
Nothing formal, just a short conversation over coffee and a chance to understand life here through real voices.

I’ll be in Chiang Mai for two months and feel like I’m missing the human side behind the places I see.
If you’re open to it, we can meet for a morning coffee. Basic English is totally fine and patience plus Google Translate works too :)

One small note: at the end of our chat, I’d love to take a simple photo and share it on my Instagram with a few words about your story - only if that feels comfortable for you.🙏🏼

[PART 1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p81813/taxidermy_of_my_wife_went_horribly_wrong_please/)

Even with all the stitching, the gluing, the God-knows-what chemical cocktail Colby slathered on to make Tommy “whole” again, it wasn’t him. Not even close.

I’ve spent enough time around animals, cats especially, to know how a body is supposed to move. This thing lurched. A sloppy, side-to-side wobble, like a drunk toddler taking its first steps. Every clumsy shuffle closed the distance between us, and for one awful heartbeat, I got the sense it thought I was its mother, its anchor in the new world.

And that’s when the fear hit bone-deep.

I stumbled back, the cheap plastic curtain Colby had hung from the ceiling wrapping around my ankle like a dead man’s hand. My foot snagged, and I went down hard, flat on my ass against the cold concrete. The toolbox beside me skidded away with a metallic scrape, just out of reach, my fingers slipping uselessly along its smooth lid.

For a split second I wanted nothing more than to snatch it up, swing it, and turn whatever scraps of Tommy were still shambling toward me back into the same warm, formless mess I’d scooped into a plastic bag the day before.

Maybe this time I’d bury him deep enough he’d stay down.

“What the fuck is that?!” I hissed in Colby’s direction, my voice cracking somewhere between terror and fury.

He just stared down at me with that crooked smile, half proud parent, half dog that knows it’s dragged something dead onto the porch. He watched me writhing in the plastic curtain like I was some trapped possum he’d cornered for fun.

“It’s your boy!” he crowed. “All fixed up!”

Fixed.

Right.

Whatever was stuffed inside the sagging skin of that fat orange bastard must’ve heard my voice. Must’ve recognized it, because its two bulging eyes shifted. Not in unison. Not even close. They rolled lazily in their sockets, like wet marbles floating in cold soup, trying to decide which direction reality was in.

One pupil drifted sideways toward the bridge of its nose, drifting like it was caught in a slow ripple. The other wandered across the room, scanning for something, maybe looking for me, maybe for Colby, maybe for whatever it thought was its owner or maker or both.

Up close, they looked like snowballs jammed into its skull by someone who didn’t understand how eyeballs were supposed to fit. A size too big. Maybe two. Definitely not meant to be there.

I thrashed harder in the plastic bear trap Colby called a curtain, and by some miracle the cheap material finally gave way, ripping under the frantic, ugly strength of pure panic. The second my ankle came free, I lashed out with a slow, lazy kick at whatever was pretending to be Tommy.

It didn’t dodge, didn’t even try. 

It just folded.

The whole thing slumped sideways like a sack of wet grain, one eye popping half loose from the socket it had never belonged in to begin with. And Colby, the mountain of fat that was him was dropped to his knees beside it as if I’d kicked his newborn child.

The scream he let out was so raw, so animal, that for one horrible second, I almost felt guilty.

“GIVE HIM TIME TO ADJUST!” he shrieked, voice warbling and drenched in snot and hysteria. “I PROMISE HE’LL BE GOOD-BRAND NEW!”

My hand shot out toward the red toolbox, fingers closing around the cold handle of a screwdriver. I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just moved, a sudden animal burst of adrenaline firing through my legs.

Colby noticed instantly.

Apparently, I was more important than his masterpiece.

“Man, don’t be like that!” he bellowed, and I could hear him lumbering after me, heavy, clumsy footsteps shaking the floorboards like a predator with a limp.

I scrambled toward the stairs and bolted up them on all fours, the way I used to as a kid when I wanted to feel fast. But now it wasn’t exhilarating. It was desperate, messy, painful. My knees slammed the wood; my palms slipped on dust. I could hear Colby’s ragged breath right behind me.

Then I felt it, that sudden clamp around my ankle.

Wet, greasy, disgustingly warm.

It wrapped around me like something pulled from a clogged drain.

For a heartbeat I braced myself for the yank, the violent drag backward, my teeth smashing on the steps, the tumble into the dark where Tommy waited to welcome me to whatever afterlife rejects like us ended up in. 

But the pull never came.

He just held me there while I kicked and thrashed like a trapped animal. His grip was firm but trembling, the way someone holds onto the last valuable thing they own.

I twisted around, breath sawing in and out, and met his eyes.

Those wet, stupid cow eyes. Shining with a sadness so heavy it didn’t belong on a man his size. Like I was the only thing he had left in this world.

Something in me recoiled.

Without thinking, without even aiming, I swung the screwdriver down and drove it straight into his hand.

It slid in almost too easily, like his skin had just been waiting to split.

There was a soft, sickening give as metal punched through muscle.

Colby’s grip vanished instantly.

He howled and staggered backward trying to catch onto anything as he fell down, his fat fingers sliding off the walls of the basement.

And as he fell, a quiet, shameful part of me hoped the concrete would finish what I couldn’t, snap his neck, crack his skull, silence him for good.

I didn’t hear a break or a thud, just the hollow gulp of the dark swallowing him whole. I didn’t wait for anything more. I lunged for the hatch, fingers scraping along the edge as I hauled myself up. I didn’t bother closing it. I just ran.

The porch lights were dead, the world a blur as I burst outside, nearly twisting my ankle on the slick boards. I skidded across the wet grass, scrambling upright, lungs burning. Then I threw myself into the car, jammed the key in, and kicked the engine awake.

I drove until the house vanished behind the trees, until the glow of Colby’s porch, dead and hollow, was nothing but a smudge in the rearview mirror. My hands were trembling so hard the wheel kept slipping under my fingers, the rubber feeling slick, like someone else’s grip was still on it.

A mile out, I finally let myself breathe. It came out shaky, uneven, like my lungs were trying to cough out the fear still lodged inside them. The road was empty, just a pale strip cutting through the fields, the headlights catching nothing but fog and the occasional fence post.

When I hit the first crossroads, I slowed down. Not because I wanted to, my whole body screamed at me to keep going, never look back but because I needed to know if something was behind me. I checked the mirrors once. Twice. A third time.

Nothing.

By the time I reached my street, the sky was starting to grey, just that dead, washed-out color the world gets before anything wakes up. The houses looked unfamiliar, like copies of homes I used to know. Even mine. Especially mine.

I parked crooked in the driveway, halfway onto the grass, too drained to care. The engine clicked as it cooled, each sound sharp enough to make me flinch. I sat there for a moment with my forehead against the steering wheel, just breathing, trying to remember what “safe” was supposed to feel like.

Eventually, I forced myself out. The air was damp, colder than I expected, and it slapped me awake enough to move. Gravel crunched under my shoes as I walked to the door, every step slow. My legs felt like they still remembered the basement, like they expected hands to grab them again any second.

The key almost slipped out of my fingers when I tried to unlock the door. I hadn’t realized how stained my hands were until I saw the dark, dried streaks under the porch light. His blood. Mine. I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I shut the door behind me and leaned on it, eyes closed, letting the familiar smell of dust and old wood settle around me. For a second, it helped.

I kicked off my shoes, letting them fall wherever, and walked to the kitchen. The lights flickered on, too bright after the dark, and I had to squint. The room was untouched, same mugs by the sink, same half-empty cereal box, same note on the fridge I’d meant to throw away a week ago.

But even after I locked the door, deadbolt, chain, the whole works, my chest stayed tight, like something in me was still braced for Colby to come lurching out of the dark with that screwdriver jutting from his arm, eager to return the favor by burying it in my eyes.

I went straight to the sink and scrubbed my hands like a man trying to wash off a crime. The water ran brown, dirt, blood,rot of the basement , who knows, and the harder I scrubbed, the hotter my skin burned. I dumped the bowls and cups the moment they filled, terrified the stink of that place might cling to the ceramic, might somehow call him here like a dog following a scent trail.

That’s when the floorboard behind me creaked.

My heart didn’t just jump, it tried to claw its way out of my ribs. I spun around, fist cocked, ready to plant a punch right between those big, weepy cow eyes of his-

\-but it wasn’t Colby.

It was Samantha.

She squinted at me from the doorway, her face half-lit, half-lost in shadow, looking more confused than scared.

“What are you doing?” she asked, voice thick with sleep.

I had never been so relieved to see another human being in my life. Something inside me cracked open. I rushed to her and wrapped her up, clutching her like some kid who stayed up past bedtime watching a horror flick and then realized he still had to walk down the hallway alone.

She smiled, small, tired and looped her arms around me, though they hung weakly, like she barely had the strength to hold her own weight.

“It’s okay,” she whispered against my shoulder. “You should get some rest.”

I pulled back just to make sure she was real, that her eyes weren't a pair of glass Christmas decorations.

“I didn’t hear you come in,” she murmured, brushing her thumb over the side of my hand. “You’re shaking.”

“Yeah” I whispered “Rough night”

I just replied, feeling myself sinking deeper into her embrace with every passing second.

Thankfully, she didn’t push for details. If she had, I wasn’t sure what would’ve spilled out. 

She just squeezed my wrist and stepped past me, grabbing a towel off the counter to wipe the water I’d splashed everywhere. She moved slowly, like everything hurt. Or maybe she was just that tired.

“You’re gonna crash hard in a minute,” she said, voice soft, almost patient. “Just… go lie down. I’ll clean the rest.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. The tension in my body was still buzzing like static, but I didn’t argue. I felt stripped raw, like a thin-skinned version of myself.

She guided me toward the doorway with a warm, steady hand on my back. I managed a nod, or something close to it, and drifted down the hall. I don’t remember getting to the bedroom. I don’t remember lying down. One heartbeat I was upright, the next I was gone, sinking into the mattress.

Sleep didn’t come gently. It came in crushing waves, thick darkness, then a flash of memory so sharp it felt like glass. Over and over, the same moment.

The screwdriver sinking into his hand.

My brain, ever the showman, decided to ramp up the production.

Now let’s see it in slow motion!

Some deranged director living behind my eyes shouted it like a carnival barker.

And suddenly it all stretched out, inch by awful inch, the push of metal against skin, the way it puckered before it tore, the sickening give of flesh parting around the steel. The color of it, the heat of it, the way his breath hitched wetly in shock. Every frame a little clearer than it had any right to be.

When the show finally sputtered to an end, I came to with the bed half-cold beside me. Samantha was already gone, of course, she was. At least one of us had some damn sense of manners, or mortals, as my scrambled brain tried to call it. She hadn’t had the heart to wake me. 

There was no refund for the night’s entertainment unless you counted the puddle of drool glued to my pillow. I peeled my cheek off it with a wet smack that felt far too loud in the empty room.

For a split second, I let myself pretend the whole thing had been a fever dream, one of those sweaty, delirious nightmares you laugh about later but never really forget. But reality settled in fast. My body told the truth before my mind could lie: muscles stiff like I’d run a marathon through broken glass, a skull-throb pounding behind my eyes like a truck tire had used my head for a speed bump.

Yesterday happened.

All of it.

I walked into the kitchen, made myself a cup of black coffee, and sipped it between bites of yesterday’s stale sandwich. Then another long, scalding shower, scrubbing myself until my skin felt new, or at least separate from the night before. Fresh clothes, keys in hand, and I got in the car.

Half of me wanted to go to work and pretend nothing had happened.

The other half wanted to walk into the nearest police station, even if I had nothing that would make sense to say.

I went with the first option.

So I spent the morning taking X-rays of dogs that swallowed things they shouldn’t, socks batteries, God knows what else, checking tabbies whose kidneys were finally waving the white flag, smiling and nodding whenever the job required it.

I was in the middle of a routine checkup on a green parrot named Polly, who kept lunging for my stethoscope like it owed her money, when my phone buzzed in my pocket, slow and lazy at first.

Then again.

And again.

A steady, insistent tremor, like it was tapping its foot and waiting for me to get a clue.

I finally excused myself and pulled it out.

The screen was a mess of missed calls from Samantha.

Dozens of them.

And beneath those, message after message stacking on top of each other, flooding the screen so fast the notifications blurred into a single smear of panic.

I didn’t even think, I called her back immediately. My mind sprinted ahead of the ringing, car crash, her parents, the house on fire, God forbid another damn cat. Every worst-case scenario piled on top of the next.

But when she picked up, she wasn’t crying.

She was breathless.

Happy.

Almost vibrating through the speaker.

“SOMEONE FOUND TOMMY!” she practically screamed, her voice cracking with joy.

And for a second, the world just stopped.

“What?” The word tore out of me, strangled, thin, like my own voice didn’t believe what it was saying. Like it already knew, the lie should’ve collapsed by now.

“He just, came in!” Samantha rushed on, breathless, almost tripping over her own excitement. “Some fat guy, middle-aged, kind of sweaty, asking if we’d lost a cat!”

My stomach bottomed out.

“And he had Tommy,” she said, and the joy in her voice felt like a knife sliding between my ribs. “He had him, babe. Said he found him wandering near the outskirts of town. He’s a little dirty but otherwise he’s fine! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

Her voice cracked on the last word.

I didn’t answer.

Because I could believe it.

And my hands had started to shake.

“Babe? Babe, are you there? Can I drop him off soon? I want you to check him out- y’know, make sure no cat messed with him.”

She’d said cat, not car, but it didn’t matter. My brain snagged on the wrongness of all of it, the impossible overlap of truth and nightmare. I still couldn’t believe any of it was happening. Couldn’t believe the lie hadn’t detonated in my face.

My hand dragged across my forehead, and only then did I notice how slick it was, sweat beading at my hairline like I’d just sprinted a mile.

“Yeah… yeah,” I muttered. My voice sounded far away, like it belonged to someone calmer than I was. “Drop him by… anytime. Whenever.”

I hung up before she could hear the panic creeping in through my teeth.

The phone slipped back into my pocket, disappearing into the dark like something I didn’t want to look at. The leftover notifications still buzzed against my leg, faint, persistent, like a ghost tapping from inside a coffin lid.

I turned back to Polly and her owner, forcing a smile that barely fit on my face.

“She’s fine,” I said, voice thin. “See you next month.”

But the thought kept chewing at me, buzzing in my skull like flies crowding a fresh corpse, ribs of truth jutting out from under the rotting lie I’d wrapped around everything.

Then I just folded.

Sat down on the cold tile floor beneath one of the cabinet shelves, knees drawn in, like I was ducking from gunfire, only I could hear.

I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, time stretching thin and strange, until I heard footsteps coming down the hall.

Samantha.

I pushed myself up fast, pretending I’d just dropped something, like I’d been crouched down hunting for a pen that rolled away instead of hiding behind the cabinet like a nervous wreck. But the truth was sitting right there on the counter in front of me, a blue cat carrier. The thing I’d really lost stuffed neatly inside it like evidence.

She rounded the table, saw me, and practically launched herself at me. Her arms wrapped tight, too tight, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt like an almost-empty tube of toothpaste, one good press away from spilling whatever guts I have left in me.

“ISN'T IT EXCITING? Our little family is whole again!”

She beamed at me, that wide white grin of hers almost too bright, then pulled away just enough to press a kiss to my lips. I prayed it didn’t taste like rot. She gave the carrier a gentle tap before looking back up at me.

“So, when are you getting off?”

“In like an hour… half an hour.”

My eyes were glued to the carrier. No way in hell was I staying here for an hour. Not now.

“Great!”

Samantha grinned and leaned down to peek inside, giving whatever was in there a tiny, cheerful wave.

“See ya soon, buddy. Have fun with daddy, alright?”

Her voice went soft, sweet before she straightened again.

“Oh, and the guy slipped me his phone number, just in case.” She said it like she was offering me a coupon from the Sunday paper. “He told me he didn’t need this junk anymore, but if you could call him and maybe drop it off after you bring Tommy home? That’d be just great.”

“Phone number?”

The words fell out of my mouth like I’d never heard the term before, like telephone was some new plague spreading through town.

She snorted. “I didn’t know you were the jealous type!”

That smirk of hers cut across her face like a fresh knife mark. “Not in a creepy way, alright? Just… y’know.”

“How did he look?”

She screwed up her face, digging around in her brain like the memory was stuck behind cobwebs.

“Uhhh… fat guy. Real pale. And he reeked, God, he reeked…of like…” She rotated her hand, searching.

“Bleach?” I offered.

“Yeah. Yeah, like chemicals and cigarette smoke had a baby and then left it in a hot car.”

She glanced around the room again, like something in here might suddenly explain itself if she stared hard enough.

“But… how did you know, though?”

“He stopped by here a couple times,” I said. My tongue felt too big in my mouth. “With a cat.”

“OOOHH. Alright, got it!”

She laughed, bright and careless, like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. “Yeah, see you in a bit! Love you!”

I watched her leave, watched the shape of her slip away from the doorframe and vanish down the hall like a ghost.

Now I was alone with it, sitting on my table like a package someone should have burned instead of delivered. I didn’t know if I was ready to see how he looked all “adjusted.” My hand drifted to the scalpel. Cold metal, thin as a whisper, steady in my grip. I squeezed it until the handle bit into my palm. After what I’d done with that screwdriver, I figured I could manage this, too.

I unlatched the crate. One piece of metal slid off another with a sound like a tired machine screaming in its sleep. The door swung open with a long, rusty whine, like something that had been left out in the rain too many nights.

I stepped back, wedging myself between two wooden shelves painted white. Funny thought, the blood splatter would look beautiful against that clean backdrop if this thing decided to go for my throat.

Instead, an orange shape eased out of the carrier.

And a sound followed.

A purr. A warm, rolling, family purr.

Not the metallic, broken rattle I’d heard before. Not forced, not wrong.

This one was soft, organic.

The scalpel slid out of my hand, clattering against the floor as my fingers uncurled in something like relief, weak, shaky, stupid relief.

Because it looked like Tommy.

The fat bastard who’d been reduced to a bloody street pancake was somehow back again. Standing there. Breathing. Purring. A perfect, uncanny copy dropped straight out of some cosmic printer. Sure, one of the hind legs dragged just a hair, and one eye drifted a little too far left, as if it couldn’t quite remember where the world was supposed to be but it was him.

It was fucking him, in all his high-cholesterol, hairball-hoarding glory.

I dug out my phone, thumb trembling just enough to piss me off. The second the screen lit up, I dialed Samantha.

“I’ll be late,” I said, already rehearsing the lie in my head. “I need to run some extra checkups on Tommy… an hour, maybe?”

It rolled off my tongue too easily. That was the part that scared me, how natural lying had become, like slipping into a pair of worn shoes.

And before I knew it, I was back in the car, engine coughing to life. The blue carrier sat on the passenger seat like evidence of a crime. I was driving out to return it to its rightful owner.

     I loved our coffee date on Tuesday. You picked the perfect table, oh I knew you would. The sun was shining at just the right angle, so our seats were warm, but the table was lcold. The breeze had put a chill on, which led to my surprise when I saw that long, sand colored dress you wore. But I knew you'd surprise me, and I was delighted all the same. The denim bomber you chose fit just right. I felt my heart race when i looked up and saw your radiance glowing above that fur collar, engulfed in thick, flowing gold. I didn't feel the smile grow on my face. Yours grew brighter when you saw me coming down the sidewalk, your smile a star among lampposts. I wasn't even expecting a handshake, let alone a hug that could melt my bones. I held the door for you, but you shoved me inside, chivalry be damned. The line was short, so I had to choose quickly. When you hooked your arm in mine I completely forgot what I wanted, but you had already asked for cinnamon dark roast for us both. I wasnt until we sat down that I was afford the privilege to gaze into the sparkling sapphires that are your eyes. It wasn't until I got lightheaded that i remembered to breathe. When you reached across for my hand, my heart stopped. You asked me about pets, I asked you about kids. You said you love the color yellow, but you already knew my favorite was orange. Whenni asked how, you just shrugged and said ""Because you're warm."" I wonder when we should plan the wedding. When it was time to leave you insisted on paying becsuse you asked me out first. You're adorable. I ask if i can walk you home, you ask if i need a ride. I asked if you'll come in, but you needed to get your daughter from school. My son lives with his mother. You hug me once more, I want to fall into your lips. Once on the cheek, and you'd be on your way. I had hoped to hear from you soon, and not soon enough will it be every day. For now I'll settle for more coffee on Monday. I'll be counting the seconds, each tick a second closer to you.

1pc4aqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1pc4aqu/how_alcohol_caused_my_psyhosis/,How Alcohol caused my psyhosis,"I didn’t touch alcohol until I was twenty-four — an age by which most of my friends had already become professional drinkers, the sort of people who could discuss hops and malts with the seriousness of surgeons. I had lived a fairly conservative life up to then. It wasn’t that I had anything against drinking or smoking; I simply never felt the *pull*. Life had been fast enough, loud enough, distracting enough.

And then I moved to High Wycombe.

A town so quiet that even my own thoughts echoed. The council did its best: the new shopping complex gleamed with a big Cineworld, and a trail of familiar bars lined the weekend routes of anyone desperate for a hint of nightlife. But for me, after London, it felt like being dropped into a glass jar. The boredom clung like condensation.

Then came Tom.

Tom, six years older, my new flatmate, and the most elegant alcoholic I had ever met. A gentleman with nerd-like precision — the type who could finish half a bottle of whisky and still organise his bookshelf alphabetically at 3 a.m. I watched him for weeks in silent awe, unable to understand how someone could drink like that and remain… refined.

One evening he invited me out with his friends. They were just like him: sensible, charming, articulate — all of them swirling their drinks like philosophers holding court. Something clicked inside me.

*These are my kind of people,* I thought.  
*Let me join in.*

And that was it. After six years of adult resistance, alcohol finally wrapped its fingers around me. Yin called out to yang, and soon cigarettes followed. The transformation was instant. With a drink in hand and smoke drifting over my shoulder, I became a different version of myself — confident, articulate, creative. Especially with Tom and his circle around me.

Over time, I learned the spirits like one learns a new language.

Beer was the slow warm-up, a gentle rising tide.  
Vodka was x2 — quick elevation, sharper thoughts.  
Whisky was x3 — intelligence, wit, a fire in the mind.  
Rum was x4 — maximum creativity, a mad carnival in my skull.  
Wine was relaxation incarnate.

And the strangest part? No hangovers. Not once. I convinced myself it was because I wasn’t drinking “to get hungover,” whatever that meant. As long as I wasn’t feeling low, the mornings were clean and bright.

Three years passed. I was slowing down, though I refused to admit it. My energy sagged each morning like a deflated balloon. I needed something to kickstart me. I had tried coffee years before, but it destroyed my stomach so violently that I practically swore a lifelong oath never to touch the stuff again.

  
But oaths mean nothing to a tired mind.

**September 21st, 2020.**  
A new phase of life. I had moved into a beautiful place in central London — bright windows, clean air, a mental reset. I felt good. Strong. Balanced. I thought, *Maybe coffee will be different now.*

And it was.

Coffee hit me like a crown descending. A warm jolt of clarity. A throne for my thoughts. It was the new king of my mornings, while alcohol remained the loyal monarch of my nights.

**Coffee in the morning, alcohol at night.**  
**Coffee in the morning, alcohol at night.**

A perfect cycle.

What could possibly go wrong?

But routines have a way of turning into rituals, and rituals have a way of turning into traps. Inside my mind, a fuse was burning — slowly, quietly, invisibly. The caffeine sharpened everything; the alcohol blurred everything; and somewhere between the two, reality began to warp.

The mixture felt like a spell, a chemical mantra brewing in my brain.  
A spark here.  
A tremor there.  
Little signs I ignored.

Until one day, it all erupted.

Thoughts twisted into shapes that didn’t belong to me. The world tilted. My reflections spoke louder than voices. Day and night switched places. Logic unravelled like string pulled from a sweater.

**It felt like a bomb had gone off — not in the world, but in my mind.**  
And in the ruins, I found myself face-to-face with something I never expected:  
my own psychosis, blossoming from the cracks of that daily mixture I once thought was harmless.

This is the story of how I believe it happened.  
How boredom led to alcohol, how alcohol led to cigarettes, how exhaustion led to coffee, and how all of it together built a storm inside me that I never saw coming.

A storm born in High Wycombe.  
Amplified in London.  
Fueled by coffee.  
Brightened by alcohol.  
And finally —  
finally —

1pc4alv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pc4alv,what do you think about this brewing-variables map & minerals in our water?,"

Hey folks,

Sharing this brewing-variables map (attached) that ranks what actually changes your coffee the most. Stuff like grind size, water temp, brew ratio, filters… and then boom: mineral composition of water sitting right up there like it’s the main character.

This kind of shocked me, because in India most of us are brewing with plain RO water — especially in cities like Delhi — and I recently learned that:

RO basically has zero magnesium/calcium

but still keeps some bicarbonate, which apparently kills acidity

and that’s why our brews can taste a bit “flat” or muted even when everything else is dialed in


Then I saw how people abroad add tiny amounts of minerals (MgSO₄, CaCl₂, drops, packets etc.) to get closer to ideal coffee water, and how it supposedly boosts sweetness, clarity, consistency, and even espresso puck behavior.

So now I’m curious to know  do any of you actually add minerals to your RO water? And has it made a noticeable difference for you?

My best friend is LDS and he drinks caffeinated hot tea and nobody in his religion gives him flack for it. I do find many of their doctrines, especially the older ones, like polygamy and their racist attitudes unappealing.

And while some of their current beliefs are *extremely* unusual, even for a religion, I don't think LDS is on the same level of toxicity as JW or Scientology, is actually not a cult and even more so, I've encountered kinder LDS than kinder ex-LDS people online. And in every interaction I had with Mormon missionaries in real life, I didn't really get the sense overall that they were proselyting me.

I’d like to hear some feedback!

Now from me,
only memories will remain.
I’ve got just a few hours,
the clock will ring again.

And as its tick-tock drags on,
I still have time… though not for long.

And that’s how I fell into the doubt,
the big doubt of wondering
if you’d be here with me at all.

It was at that place I met you first,
I could see you still,
but you wore another man’s coat.

Truth is just relative,
reality, a liar.
Seeing you calm, standing in line
for the great parade of hypocrisy.

The coffee smell,
Bitter and desired.
This room,
Wasted and tarnished.

I never thought that on my deathbed
you’d still be haunting my mind, a fate I had to face.

I fear to have realized
the butterflies you gave me
were nothing but worms in disguise.
My luck has run dry.

Like someone who’s lost at the casino
more than a thousand times,
or like the fool who won the lottery, ironically.

Years of watching you change so much
and watching myself grow old
made me lose my sense of touch.

Cursed shapes turn into a monochrome bruise.
A black and white mess
that only to my eyes blends into sense.

The other day I cursed the gun…
it didn’t answer.
I lived another day…
but with no worth.

I could only wish I was stronger,
wish I was braver.
But so on the days go
and alone will I stay, no?

Still, it is to no avail 
when I realize 
that I love you again…

I love you so much
I could remind you of who you are
just in case you ever forgot.
And I am far from you,
knowing nothing.

Cast aside, thrown to the wild,
wondering what would’ve happened
if you were in my bed tonight.

Maybe in another life I’ll find out
and meet your pink lips again.
Maybe another lips will I claim
yet think of yours before I sleep.

As I’ll wait for you,
wait for your shadow… an image.
Time I can tergiversate
If it means seeing you again.

For divine has to be the reason,
the only reason why I’d leave the thought of you.
Thank God I don’t believe in God
So I can breathe again to see you.

And I still have time...
I crave more time.
Not silence.
It’s there, it listens when no one does.

The clock is ringing,
my vision blurs,
I see you standing
but you don’t move,
you only stare.

I try to hold you
but you fade away,
It is so close and far away
I think my moment’s come.

Oh you are so pretty…
I can only feel my chest heavy,
I look at myself slipping.

Your hands are as warm as I remember,
bliss is what I feel, a muse is what I see.
A drug meant to set me free.

And your eyes, two lights guiding me from afar,
bright and shine as a thousand stars.
I adore seeing them at last.

I don’t know what’s real and what’s not,
My common sense without you has of course, no sense.
I don’t care about anything else
as your lips I observe and make me melt.

I lean in to touch them… a moment so simple yet perfect.
an act, the last. But before I can think of anything else,
I open my eyes and the room…  it’s empty.

A lonely butterfly,
a silent wheelchair,
a lonely gun.

I've posted about the shit my roommate has done before, but this is the worst thing so far.

My roommate has been pushing for MONTHS to get a dog. A *big* dog — like a German shepherd or a husky — even though she’s gone 50–60 hours a week and has never taken care of an animal on her own in her life (her dad has farm dogs, he does all of their care. She has no idea what work goes into it). My fiancé and I told her **no** repeatedly because our apartment has a 2-pet limit and I already have 2 cats (one I’ve had for 13 years, the other is a younger companion cat I got after the older one's brother passed). They were here BEFORE her, and they’re ESAs on the lease. There is literally **no legal or practical room for a third animal** in this apartment.

We explained all this to her like reasonable adults. She argued every time. She kept saying it “wasn’t fair” that *I* get to have cats and she “gets nothing.” Like… girl, these aren’t toys. They’re my pets. They existed before you even lived here. Hell, even my oldest cat is nearly as old as her (roommate is 19) - and I knew him long before her. He's far more important to me than some random backyard bred dog and its trashy owner.

Fast forward to a couple days ago:  
She doesn't come home after work, disappears for a day without a word (mind you, also flaking on helping me run important errands because I was gone for a week over Thanksgiving. She agreed to petsit my cats while I was away and wasn't even home most of the time for that. Just fed them in the mornings and dipped)…

And we find out she got a dog because she posted on her Instagram story with a selfie of her and the dog:

>SO I DID A THING

That was how we found out.  
Not a conversation.  
Not a warning.  
Not even a heads-up.  
Her *Instagram story.*

She literally was going to bring a big 8-month-old dog into the apartment in secret after we said no dozens of times and after the leasing office explicitly told us we can’t go over the pet limit. Meanwhile, my fiancé and I are the ones who clean, buy the household stuff, and actually keep the apartment functioning. We pay a larger chunk of rent combined than she does, we pay utilities, we pay for internet, we even pay for 2/3rds of her parking every month because she helps us with transport (my disability keeps me from driving, and my fiancé is from NYC originally and only rode the train, so is currently waiting the months out to be able to take his driver's test).

I asked her how she planned to get a dog with all the hours she works - she was going to lock it in her small bedroom 24/7. Like it was in prison. You can't even see the floor in her bedroom, and she was going to stuff a large dog in there.

She’s now refusing to help us move next week (we are moving to a new place, and she couldn't wait 10 more days to get her stupid dog) because we were upset that she tried to sneak an unauthorized animal into our shared space. She didn't pay the deposit; she didn't find this apartment. This was OUR space; I invited her into it, and this is how she shows gratitude.

I feel like I’m losing my sanity living with someone who treats a shared home like it's all hers and acts like we’re the unreasonable ones for having boundaries. I already contacted management (both via email and call) to make sure they know about her violation, and that we do not support it and do not want a dog here. Waiting to hear back.

I've also been actively packing every shared thing that I own and don't want her hands on. The smart TV, everything in the bathroom she helped herself to, my pots and pans that she scratched, my air fryer that she's never cleaned after using it multiple times a week, the coffee maker. I even uninstalled the fancy rainfall shower head I got. Even my couch is blocked off by moving boxes. Everything has been silently revoked.

And this isn’t even the first time she’s pulled selfish crap like this.

Just last week, my fiancé and I spent **an entire day traveling across the country**. Exhausted. Jet-lagged. Running on fumes. We had a couple urgent errands to do when we landed — stuff that actually mattered and had deadlines.

She offered to tag along, said she’d help… and then immediately derailed everything because she wanted to stop at **Target for Black Friday deals**. Deals she literally had *all day* to shop for while we were the ones on a plane for 12 hours and hopped across timezones. But no — she dragged us through Target while we were dead tired, because she *needed* to buy random unnecessary junk and couldn’t wait.

By the time she was done wandering around the store, half the errands we needed to do were closed. She got what she wanted; we were screwed. Classic pattern with her.

She spent all week going out of town every day when we were gone, shopping at Mall of America while simultaneously complaining about ""having no money"" for her own apartment. She even had the gall to ask me if she could ""temporarily"" stay in our spare room at my new apartment while she kept hunting. I said absolutely NOT. She's been spending her money on junk and dogs while we're in the midst of vacating the apartment (it's being demolished and they told us to get out within 3 months).

So, between the secret dog, the entitlement, the flaking, the lack of any awareness, and the way she makes every situation about herself… I swear living with her is like being held hostage by someone who thinks they’re the main character in a Disney Channel show. Look up the ""quirky anger issues girl"" from the Willdotcom videos and that's literally her -- cringy millennial humor and all. My fiancé and I literally send them to each other and are like ""omg that's her.""

Just needed to scream into the void because… WHAT EVEN IS THIS BEHAVIOR?

1pc3yrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1pc3yrj/youre_not_lazy_your_adhd_brain_just_needs/,You're not lazy. Your ADHD brain just needs different shit at different times. 3 daily anchors + rotating tasks that actually stick,"For years I genuinely thought I was just broken. Like I'd wake up all motivated, thinking “okay TODAY I’m gonna be productive fr” and I’d try doing morning meditation or whatever. Day 1? Amazing. Day 2? Fine. Day 3? I want to yeet my phone out the window because doing the EXACT same thing again feels like my brain is being punished.

So then I’d be like “okay screw routines, I’ll just go with the flow.”  
Yeah… that lasted like 48 hours before everything turned into chaos and I accomplished absolutely nothing except stressing myself out lol.

At night I’d literally sit there like… why can’t I just be a normal functioning human?? Why does everything either get boring instantly or spiral into mess?

Anyway, eventually I realised something that kinda changed everything for me (and ngl made me feel a lot less like a failure):  
I’m not lazy. My ADHD brain just needs structure AND variety at the same time. If things are too rigid, I die inside. If things are too flexible, I fall into a black hole of chaos. Like I need both or my brain just taps out.

And the first thing that actually helped was figuring out what I was EVEN struggling with.  
For me it’s focus + time management. I know what I need to do but starting? Impossible. Staying on one thing? Also impossible. I’d be “busy” all day but not actually doing anything that matters.

Once I understood that, I stopped trying random productivity tips that work for “normal” people and started picking stuff that directly targets MY issues instead of trying to copy someone else's perfect morning routine.

So here’s the system that weirdly worked (and I've tried literally everything so I was shocked):

Basically I have 3 things I do EVERY day. Same time, same thing, non-negotiable. These don’t change.  
Then everything else rotates so my brain doesn’t get bored and bail.

**My 3 daily anchors (aka the only stable part of my life lol)**

Morning: Stand near sunlight + drink water for 2–5 minutes. That’s it. No pressure. Just “hey brain, we’re alive, let’s wake up.”

Work: Look at my calendar before doing ANYTHING. Takes 2 mins and stops me from jumping between 5 random tasks like an unmedicated squirrel.

Evening: Write down ONE win on a sticky note. Even if it’s tiny like “replied to 3 emails” idc, it counts. Makes me feel like I didn’t completely flop the day.

These happen every day and because they’re stupidly simple, I actually do them.

**The rotating stuff (the part that keeps my brain from quitting)**

Each day has different “extras” depending on morning/work/evening. Like:

Morning extras:  
– Monday: write 3 things I’m grateful for  
– Tuesday: 2-min body scan  
– Wednesday: set 3 intentions  
– Thursday: drink coffee mindfully (no phone scrolling trap)  
– Friday: light stretching

All of these basically help me start my brain without overwhelming myself.

Work extras:  
– Monday: brain dump during lunch  
– Tuesday: two-minute rule  
– Wednesday: desk stretches  
– Thursday: 5-min walk  
– Friday: check if I’m doing actual important stuff or just fake-busy

Same goal (focus/time mgmt), but different vibes every day.

Evening extras:  
– journal a bit  
– write priorities for tomorrow  
– gratitude  
– what I learned  
– quick week review

Again, all for winding down but not the same boring thing every night.

And idk how to explain it but this combo of “same base” + “different details” just… works?? Like it’s the first routine I haven’t abandoned by day freakin’ 3.

I think the reason it works is because the anchors give my ADHD brain stability and remove decisions.  
But the rotating activities keep the dopamine alive.  
And also different times of day need different vibes.  
Morning brain = needs gentle activation.  
Work brain = needs structure + focus.  
Evening brain = needs calm + closure.  
Trying to meditate at 2pm when I’m supposed to focus never worked. Trying to do deep work when I just woke up also made no sense.

Anyway, I’ve been doing this for like 3 months which honestly is a record for me. If every routine you try dies immediately, maybe try the whole “structure + novelty” thing.

Idk if this makes sense or if it’s just my weird ADHD brain but… does anyone else need BOTH stability AND change at the same time?? Or am I alone in this chaos?",3,1764666945.0,VyvanseADHD,0,0.8,False
1pc3wep,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pc3wep,A little bit of Paris,"
I just spent 2 weeks in Paris and honestly… I’m already missing it.

The food, the people, the nightlife, the Christmas markets - everything was incredible. This sub helped me so much while planning my trip, so thank you to everyone who shares tips here. I originally planned to stay only three days, but I’m so glad I extended it. If you’re thinking about visiting, I highly recommend giving Paris at least a week. It deserves it.

A few tips from my experience:

Avoid random airport taxis. Stick to G7, Bolt or Uber. I met someone at my hotel who got charged €150 for a ride that should have been much cheaper.

Learn a bit of French. Even a couple of hours on your flight can help. I recommend the Coffee Break French podcast - super easy and helpful.

Food & Drinks: Download The Fork and Seeker Social. Both apps were amazing for finding great spots.

Public transport: Don’t waste time waiting in line for Navigo/metro tickets. Just buy everything through the Île-de-France Mobilities app.

1pc3nnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1pc3nnq/parking_tips_for_atlanta_falcons_vs_seattle/,Parking tips for Atlanta Falcons vs. Seattle Seahawks at Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta 12/07,")  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the falcons vs. seahawks game on sunday 12/07 at 1:00 pm. a 1:00 pm sunday kickoff means downtown is going to be a complete mess, both getting in and getting out. honestly, parking at the benz is a nightmare if you don't plan ahead.  
  
my biggest insider tip is to check out Prked. seriously, if you want to skip the traffic and the $50-$100 stadium lot prices, this is the way to go. Prked is an app where people near the stadium rent out their driveways and garages. you can pre-book a guaranteed spot on someone's property just a few blocks away for way cheaper, and you avoid all the craziness trying to get into the official decks. it's a short, easy walk and the traffic flow out of the residential areas is usually much better.  
  
for official parking, you must pre-purchase your pass through partners like parkhub or justpark . don't show up planning to pay cash on-site because the lots often sell out . lots generally open around 8:30 am to 9:00 am, so get there early if you want to tailgate . the popular tailgating spots are the home depot backyard (hdb, the official one, closest to gate 1), the yellow lot, and the blue lot . remember, the official ""corporate"" lots like hdb and blue lot have stricter rules- usually 10x10 tents and only propane grills . if you're a serious tailgater who needs charcoal grills or bigger setups, look into the non-corporate lots like lot 550 or others that are privately owned . for rv or oversized vehicles, the marshalling yard is your only official option .  
  
the best overall alternative to driving is marta, atlanta's public transit. seriously, traffic control locks down roads and prevents left turns near the stadium . taking marta avoids all that gridlock, especially the brutal post-game exit where you can sit for hours . the fare is cheap, only $2.50 each way . you have two stops: gwcc/cnn center station (right on the doorstep) or vine city station (short walk across a bridge) . insider tip: drive to an outer station like indian creek or college park and park there for free, then ride the train in .  
  
if you absolutely must drive, use the waze app, as the stadium partners with them to program all the game day road closures and one-way routes directly into the navigation . don't just rely on google maps.  
  
since it's a sunday game, you can find free street parking all day in downtown areas . i usually look for street parking around mitchell street near spiller coffee which is only a 10-15 minute walk . just be sure to double-check all signs to avoid a tow. another solid option is parking at atlantic station and taking the fetii gameday shuttle, which runs to the stadium starting two hours before kickoff .  
  
hope this helps you have a stress-free game day. go falcons!",1,1764665717.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I instantly liked her a lot and i think she likes me too. She went on a vacation 2 days after our first date, i kinda told her i'll be missing her and she told me we can text while she is on vacation and in fact she basically texts me everyday and sometimes she sends pictures.

To me that is positive.

However the day Maria left i went on a date with another girl, Anna.

I didn't feel what i felt with Maria but people told me it was too soon to say if i like a girl from only 1 date.

So since Maria was on a vacation (she comes back end this week), and people adviced me not to close any doors i went on a second date with Anna just to be sure. We grabbed a coffee talk etc. but i convinced myself even more i do not like her however.

Now Anna texted me again to know how i'm doing etc so i feel like she would love to date etc. But i don't really.

Is it better to be truthful with her? And say i like another girl and that i don't want her to feel like a second option?

Maybe this way could hurt a bit less knowing there is someone else and is not her fault?

I'm not used to rejecting girls, i'm in my late twenties and never had a gf.

I know it's risky to wait for the other since she could change idea but until now we've been texting me and Maria and she told me we will surely go on a second date when she returns.

Is weird i am already a tiny bit hooked on Maria even if we only went on a date?

1pc3h0q,https://i.redd.it/meohk5zy6r4g1.jpeg,How do I furnish our living room? Where does the couch and TV go?,"My husband and I are just moving into a new apartment, and I am really struggling to figure out the best way to lay out and design the living room/kitchen space. 

The living room is open concept to the kitchen, so when you walk in the front door, to the left is the kitchen with a peninsula. The wall directly across from the front door has a window offset toward the right and then to the right of that is the AC unit. The wall on the right has the most wall space, but there is a doorway to the bedroom and there is some wall space to the right of the front door. I don’t have great photos of the space, but I have created a mock up in an app with the correct dimensions, so I can attempt to try out different designs before I buy more furniture. Right now the only thing we have on order is an apartment size couch that is 73 in long and 33 in wide. The room is 240 in x 211 in. 


I originally thought the tv should be on the wall next to the front door, but that would mean that the couch would probably be floating in the room, which I’m not opposed to, but I think if we had a coffee table, it would block the path of travel to the bedroom. And then I’m not really sure what to do with the space behind the TV? I’m not sure if it’s enough for a dining room table even a small one? Having the couch on the other wall (like how it was staged) doesn’t seem to leave a great spot for the tv. Every way, I’m trying it, I seem to be running into awkward, unused space. So I would really love some advice!! 

If we can swing it, we would like an area to watch TV and hang out comfortably, and perhaps a dining room table that can comfortably sit at least two maybe up to four.

They don't just reject ""creeps""... they fear them. You aren't being seen as a creep because you approached; you're being seen as one because you have ""Taker Energy"" (needy, staring, desperate). Here is the 3-step fix to switch to ""Giver Energy"" so you don't get slapped.

Most guys in Delhi think ""Game"" is about a magic pickup line. Wrong. If you walk up to a girl in CP or in the Metro with the vibe of ""I hope she likes me, please validate me,"" she smells it instantly. In her head, you are just another desperate guy who is going to follow her around. You need to switch from Taker (Needy) to Giver (Chill/High Status).

Step 1: The ""10-Second"" Mindset (Kill the desperation)

Here is the mistake 99% of Indian guys make: They approach with the goal of ""Getting a Number."" That puts massive pressure on her. Your new goal: ""Give her a fun, 10-second interaction, and then be the first one to leave.""
- Taker Mindset: ""I need to get her contact."" (She feels hunted).
- Giver Mindset: ""I’m just going to share a quick observation and bounce."" (She feels safe).

Step 2: The ""Observational"" Opener (Stop using ""You are beautiful"")

In the West, you can maybe get away with direct compliments. In Delhi? Walking up to a stranger and saying ""You are beautiful"" sounds like a catcall. It puts 100% pressure on her looks and makes you look like a fanboy. Givers use reality.
- Bad Opener: ""Hi, you look amazing."" (Generic, creepy).
- Good Opener (Metro): ""I’m not gonna lie, that book looks intense. Is it a thriller?"" (Normal, low pressure).
- Good Opener (Cafe): ""Your coffee looks way better than mine. What did you order?"" This isn't a ""pickup line."" It's a conversation. It signals you are a normal, social human being, not a weirdo.

Step 3: The ""False Time Constraint"" (The Anti-Chipku Move)

The biggest fear a girl in NCR has is that you will be ""Chipku"" (sticky)... that you won't leave her alone. You must destroy this fear in the first 5 seconds. You do this with a False Time Constraint (FTC).
- Example: ""Hey, I’m actually rushing to meet a friend at the other gate, but I noticed...""
- Example: ""I’ve only got a minute before my cab comes, but...""

Why this works in Delhi:

1- Safety: She knows you are leaving soon. Her guard drops.

2- Status: It proves you aren't ""Vella"". You have places to be. You are busy.

3- Relaxation: Once she knows you aren't going to hover over her for 20 minutes, she allows herself to talk to you.

Stop trying to ""get"" numbers. That is Taker behavior. If you are in Delhi, your only goal is:

1- Mindset: ""I'm leaving in 10 seconds.""

2- Opener: ""Real observation.""

3- Frame: ""I'm busy/rushing.""

When you master this, you stop being a ""creep"" and start being the guy who brightened her day. The numbers come automatically after that.",1,1764664429.0,PickUpArtist,1,1.0,False

1pc35qk,https://i.redd.it/tcrcfuonxq4g1.jpeg,It was easier than I expected.,"Hey all final post about my 30d Journey. As people have asked for this in my past posts I'll include it in the opening paragraph. M / 46 / SW134kg / EW117.3kg. Yes I got my blood-work checked. I know some people are concerned about destroying your organs after medium length fasts like this, from what I've read I've not been convinced so you don't need to tell me I'm going to die. And I stayed on top of my minerals only having problems with the potassium as it was starting to upset my stomach at 1.5g a day.

TLDR: The part I found easy was that I ended up scrolling food videos for half my fast and it didn't give me cravings.

So, I started this fast to try and get my eating habits back on-track to what I find works best for me a LCHF/Keto eating lifestyle. I've been eating this way for several years now and love the changes I've seen and felt in my body. I was never really able to break through the 110kg mark as any time I got close my resolve would slip and then it would be back to several months of eating the SAD diet (yes I know there are two diets there) and slowly slipping back up to 130kg+. Anyways that's where I was at 134kg at the end of Oct. so I cleaned out my fridge, mentally prepared and started my fast.

For those of you reading this who are not familiar with and extended fast, the toughest part is the first few days. As I've done several multi day fasts before the uncomfortableness of getting started wasn't too difficult. I timed my start for the early afternoon so I wasn't hungry during my first sleep and got on keeping myself busy to stay distracted for the first few days. If you're wondering about my past fasts the longest one was 10 days several years ago.

So here is where I felt it was easier than expected. I'm a teacher and I was doing a unit about food in my second week and I was a little worried that the cravings would really test my resolve. but the funny thing was it didn't seem to affect me much at all. Every-time I would talk about it in class or listen to the students talk about food, I would be picturing what I was going to cook for my first meal after breaking my fast. More about that later. I think it was this mental framing of looking at it for ideas on what to make when the fast was completed that really helped me not get cravings.

So the more I thought about my first meal the more I looked for recipes and video ideas. I spent most of weeks 3-4 doom scrolling food videos. looking back on it, it was kinda crazy. I remember my last extended fast (10 days) where this is what drove me crazy.

And that brings me to today, I did a big grocery shop bought a bunch of food to finish off my fast and as I was breaking things down and getting everything stored away I finished the fast. So what did I eat to break the fast? Started with cream in my coffee, while I was making an egg drop soup (real simple just poured a beaten egg into about a cup of hot chicken broth). The soup was fantastic but after like 3/4 of a bowl I'm feeling full and will have to finish the rest later. Tomorrow I'm making a big batch of chili for my first full meal after the fast. I figure it's always better after a few days.

For everyone still working on their fasting journeys Keep Calm and Carry On!

Below are the things which they do where major problem is not **“design issues”** but lack of **“clarity issue.”** 

**1. Learning Curve User flow**  

Founders design their SaaS product while making the learning curve so complex which becomes so difficult for users to understand, thus losing the customer at a very early stage and bounce rate becoming high.    
   
No direction to move the user smoothly rather than making it complex trouble with user intent to stick to your product.    
  
**How can you fix it?**  

* Introducing one concept at a time.  
* Adding tiny “next step” guidance inside the UI (Do this next).     



**2. Directionless and forcing the user with signup pop up** 

Mostly founders do the big mistake here while making website directionless like home page after that where user should move is not cleared and making a popup forcing them to sign up which kill your SaaS funnel than any design mistakes.  

Users never give you their email id at first glance until they have tasted the value of your product.    
  
**How can you fix it?**    

* Pushing value before signup.   
* Showing a live demo.   
* Let the user try 1-2 core actions. 
* Then, ask for signup with context like **“Save your progress while signing up”.**  

Signup should be always a natural step rather than pushing the user to sign up.    
 

**3. Product language seems like it is written for experts, not for users.**   
   
SaaS apps often sound like internal teams have written the UI text after drinking lots of coffee. Users don't understand the high jargons terminologies.    
  
**How can you fix it?**    

* Replace jargon with human language.   
* Making it one idea per sentence is not to mix match or communicate a lot of things at a time.   

   
The simpler the language of the product, the higher chances of users to understand it.    
   
Most early-stage SaaS startup UX fails due to this reason, and users understand. They aren't able to understand what to do, why to do it and what will happen if they do it.    
   
If this is fixed, 60 -70% of onboarding friction disappears automatically.    
   
If anyone wants, I can break down each point with real SaaS examples or do a teardown of someone’s screen.
