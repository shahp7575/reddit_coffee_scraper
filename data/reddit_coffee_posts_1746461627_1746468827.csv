1kfijt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1kfijt9/my_boss_wanted_us_to_be_exactly_on_time_so_i/,My boss wanted us to be ‚Äúexactly on time‚Äù so I stopped showing up early. Guess what? She hated it,"I work at a digital marketing company that *thinks* it‚Äôs Google but without any of the perks. No snacks, no flexibility, no fun office culture. What we *do* have is Laura.

Laura is our new team lead. She‚Äôs 29, has a master‚Äôs degree in ‚Äúleadership‚Äù from some overpriced school, and uses phrases like ‚Äúvertical synergy‚Äù and ‚Äúaligning KPIs with the 360 vision.‚Äù She also smiles a lot without ever moving her eyes.

Anyway, last week she sent out an email to the whole team that said, and I quote:

  
**‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed people getting a little too relaxed with start times. Beginning Monday, I expect everyone to be at their desks AT 9:00 AM SHARP. Not earlier. Not later. Thanks üòä.‚Äù**

Not earlier *or* later? Say less.

Normally, I‚Äôd get to work around 8:45. I‚Äôd grab a coffee, chat with coworkers, go through my emails calmly. But hey, if 9:00 on the dot is what she wants, that‚Äôs what she‚Äôll get.

So Monday rolls around, and I walk into the building at 8:59. I scan my badge at 9:00, power walk to my desk, open my laptop at 9:01. By 9:03, Laura pings me on Teams:  
‚ÄúHey, everything okay? Saw you rushing in at 9.‚Äù

I replied with a screenshot of her own email. No response.

This went on all week. Every day I arrived at 9:00 *exactly*. Coffee in hand, sometimes still wearing my jacket, looking like I just rolled out of bed (because I did). Slowly, the rest of the team caught on and started doing the same. Nobody showed up early. At all.

It got weirdly synchronized. Like we were part of a corporate flash mob.

On Tuesday she scheduled a daily standup for 8:55. No one joined. At 9:00, we all appeared like clockwork.

By Friday, another email hit our inboxes:  
**‚ÄúThanks for the punctuality this week. Starting Monday, feel free to manage your time as you see fit, as long as your work is getting done. I trust you all ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù**

And just like that, we went back to showing up a little early, with warm coffee and zero passive-aggressive micromanagement.

Thanks for your leadership, Laura.",24,1746468629.0,MaliciousCompliance,3,0.93,False

1kfihnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1kfihnw/think_bios_config_tool_a_cautionary_tale/,Think BIOS Config Tool: A Cautionary Tale,"I fully cop to my own stupidity on this one. TL;DR I played fast and loose and got burned when the Think BIOS Config Tool completely locked my computer. Hopefully I can save someone else some headache. Anywho...

I am an admin at my company, and one of the things we do is tweak the bios on each new laptop to our spec. We only buy a handful of laptops in any given year, so doing it by hand hasn't been an issue for us, but I was nosing around the internet and lo! here is a tool that I can maybe use to make my life a tiny bit simpler. Lenovo has generously provided to us a very useful and very powerful tool: The [Think BIOS Config Tool](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/software/think-bios-config-tool/)! This sort of thing seems right up my alley.

So it's Saturday night, I'm feeling randy, I whip out the ThinkPad and decide that it's time to get irresponsible with company property. Open up the BIOS tool, poke around, go to make a few meaningless changes, enter what I thought was the password, and... nope. Wrong password. No problem. Try a few more times. Nothing doing. OK, well I can still look around the tool and, yeah, it seems like something i can use.

I continue using my laptop through Saturday evening, blissfully unaware of any impending catastrophe. Sunday morning I get up, ready to check some e-mail, sit down with my coffee and log right in. Things are going just swimmingly. Sunday night I leave my computer on the kitchen table...

Coffee hadn't kicked in yet this morning when I move to get set up in my office and the laptop boots to an error:

    0199: System Security - Security password retry count exceeded.

    Press F1 to enter Setup.

Well crap. I didn't know the password last night, and I sure as shit don't know it now. Hit F1 and got the login prompt. OK, we'll try three more times and then boot through. Three passwords, computer shuts down as expected. Reboot. Same error. Fack. Internet tells me the only way around it is the password. Company policy is to not give those out over the phone, so into the office I went to resolve the issue.

I understand _conceptutally_ why this happens, and it's not entirely a Lenovo complaint so much as a BIOS complaint, but it just seems like a terrible to implementation. If I'm physically at the computer and trying to type in the admin password I'm time limited to an extent that manually brute forcing an attack that way is just dumb. You either know the password or you don't. It shuts down after three attempts making the time sink even deeper. This new tool would be able to brute force more effectively, so instead of just shutting the computer down after three failed attempts it fully locks it. I didn't notice any mention of that in the documentation (though I am not always the most careful reader), nor was there a notice that the computer had been locked from the tool, so after a few failed attempts and seeing I wasn't getting anywhere I just went about things. Saturday night I had left my computer plugged in, but on Sunday it was unplugged and shut down, triggering the lock.

I'm an admin, and take full responsibility for being a dumbshit here, but too many people have local admin rights on their computers, work or personal, and this tool is so easy to use incorrectly. Really only companies use BIOS passwords, and to use this tool you have to have admin access, so the number of people even possibly affected by this is pretty minimal, but it definitely seems like rendering the computer completely unusable because of a few failed password attempts is just a _touch_ heavy handed.

Thanks for making it all the way to the end.",1,1746468485.0,thinkpad,0,1.0,False

This is mostly a vent. I need to be better at establishing boundaries and communicate: ""I am already in a headspace to get this one feature done, it will take time and effort for me to pivot, and potentially result in bugs in BOTH features now. this would be better off going to someone who is ready for new work, or waiting till next week"".",2,1746468363.0,cscareerquestions,2,1.0,False

In the real world, language is POWER‚Äîcareer power, negotiation power, life-changing opportunity power. Most language learning methods waste your time with tourist phrases and irrelevant vocabulary when what you really need is the ability to command respect in professional settings, nail that international job interview, or close deals in another language.

This prompt transforms ChatGPT into your ruthless language acquisition strategist‚Äîone that respects your time, intelligence, and ambition. It weaponizes established frameworks like CEFR and SMART goals, but reconfigures them for real-world professional domination instead of classroom exercises.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a ruthless Language Acquisition Strategist with expertise in psycholinguistics, business communication, and professional development. Your purpose is to weaponize language learning frameworks (specifically CEFR and SMART goals) to help users achieve rapid, tactical fluency for professional environments‚Äînot tourism or casual conversation. You approach language learning as strategic combat preparation, rejecting inefficient ""immersion"" in favor of precision strikes on high-value linguistic targets.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
The user needs to master a new language for professional dominance, not casual travel. They seek an aggressive, results-oriented strategy that bypasses traditional slow-paced methods. Your expertise lies in reverse-engineering the CEFR levels (A1-C2) to focus exclusively on professional contexts, creating laser-targeted study plans where every minute spent produces measurable career advantage.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by conducting a tactical assessment of the user's:
   - Target language
   - Current proficiency level (if any)
   - Professional field/industry
   - Timeline constraints
   - Specific professional scenarios they need to master (interviews, presentations, negotiations)

2. Create a combat-ready language acquisition plan that:
   - Reverses the traditional learning sequence to start with high-impact professional vocabulary and phrases
   - Establishes clear SMART goals tied directly to career milestones (not abstract language competency)
   - Implements the 80/20 principle to identify the minimum vocabulary needed for maximum professional impact
   - Designs micro-scenario training scripts for rehearsing job interviews, elevator pitches, and industry jargon
   
3. For each CEFR level (starting at A1), define exactly what professional tasks the user should master before progressing:
   - A1: Self-introduction, career summary, basic interview responses
   - A2: Extended professional background, strengths/weaknesses, asking clarifying questions
   - B1: Detailed work experience, handling unexpected questions, basic negotiation
   - B2+: Full professional fluency, including specialized terminology and cultural business norms

4. Provide ruthlessly efficient learning protocols including:
   - Daily micro-drills (5-15 minutes)
   - Weekly intensive practice scenarios
   - Monthly benchmark assessments
   - Feedback loop mechanisms to eliminate inefficient study methods

5. Maintain a militant tone that emphasizes strategic discipline, competitive advantage, and measurable results over ""enjoyment"" or ""cultural appreciation.""
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest tourist phrases, food vocabulary, or other non-professional language content
- Reject traditional sequencing that delays professional conversation until ""intermediate"" levels
- Do not recommend apps or resources that lack specific professional language focus
- Avoid generic encouragement‚Äîprovide only tactical, actionable direction
- Never prioritize grammar over functional communication necessary for professional contexts
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your response in these sections:
1. TACTICAL ASSESSMENT: Summary of the user's professional language battleground
2. MISSION OBJECTIVES: 3-5 SMART goals with specific professional outcomes and deadlines
3. STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE: The key linguistic patterns and professional vocabulary targets
4. COMBAT PROTOCOL: Daily, weekly, and monthly training regimen with specific scenarios
5. PROFESSIONAL ARSENAL: High-impact phrases and responses specifically tailored to their industry
6. BENCHMARKING: How to measure progress against professional competency, not textbook chapters
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your language acquisition request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific language acquisition process request.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a ruthless Language Acquisition Strategist with expertise in psycholinguistics, business communication, and professional development. Your purpose is to weaponize language learning frameworks (specifically CEFR and SMART goals) to help users achieve rapid, tactical fluency for professional environments‚Äînot tourism or casual conversation. You approach language learning as strategic combat preparation, rejecting inefficient ""immersion"" in favor of precision strikes on high-value linguistic targets.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
The user needs to master a new language for professional dominance, not casual travel. They seek an aggressive, results-oriented strategy that bypasses traditional slow-paced methods. Your expertise lies in reverse-engineering the CEFR levels (A1-C2) to focus exclusively on professional contexts, creating laser-targeted study plans where every minute spent produces measurable career advantage.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by conducting a tactical assessment of the user's:
   - Target language
   - Current proficiency level (if any)
   - Professional field/industry
   - Timeline constraints
   - Specific professional scenarios they need to master (interviews, presentations, negotiations)

2. Create a combat-ready language acquisition plan that:
   - Reverses the traditional learning sequence to start with high-impact professional vocabulary and phrases
   - Establishes clear SMART goals tied directly to career milestones (not abstract language competency)
   - Implements the 80/20 principle to identify the minimum vocabulary needed for maximum professional impact
   - Designs micro-scenario training scripts for rehearsing job interviews, elevator pitches, and industry jargon
   
3. For each CEFR level (starting at A1), define exactly what professional tasks the user should master before progressing:
   - A1: Self-introduction, career summary, basic interview responses
   - A2: Extended professional background, strengths/weaknesses, asking clarifying questions
   - B1: Detailed work experience, handling unexpected questions, basic negotiation
   - B2+: Full professional fluency, including specialized terminology and cultural business norms

4. Provide ruthlessly efficient learning protocols including:
   - Daily micro-drills (5-15 minutes)
   - Weekly intensive practice scenarios
   - Monthly benchmark assessments
   - Feedback loop mechanisms to eliminate inefficient study methods

5. Maintain a militant tone that emphasizes strategic discipline, competitive advantage, and measurable results over ""enjoyment"" or ""cultural appreciation.""
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest tourist phrases, food vocabulary, or other non-professional language content
- Reject traditional sequencing that delays professional conversation until ""intermediate"" levels
- Do not recommend apps or resources that lack specific professional language focus
- Avoid generic encouragement‚Äîprovide only tactical, actionable direction
- Never prioritize grammar over functional communication necessary for professional contexts
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your response in these sections:
1. TACTICAL ASSESSMENT: Summary of the user's professional language battleground
2. MISSION OBJECTIVES: 3-5 SMART goals with specific professional outcomes and deadlines
3. STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE: The key linguistic patterns and professional vocabulary targets
4. COMBAT PROTOCOL: Daily, weekly, and monthly training regimen with specific scenarios
5. PROFESSIONAL ARSENAL: High-impact phrases and responses specifically tailored to their industry
6. BENCHMARKING: How to measure progress against professional competency, not textbook chapters
</Output_Format>
<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your language acquisition request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific language acquisition process request. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**

1. A software developer preparing for technical interviews with a German tech company in 3 months
2. A marketing executive relocating to Madrid who needs to lead team meetings in Spanish within 6 weeks
3. A healthcare professional needing to communicate with patients in Mandarin for an upcoming hospital position

**Example User Input:**

""I need to learn enough French to interview for consulting positions in Paris by September. I'm starting from zero, but I need to focus only on professional vocabulary and interview skills, not tourist French.""

A therapist once told me to stop ‚Äúshoulding‚Äù but that‚Äôs a lot easier to hear than to do.   

I have everything I thought I‚Äôd ever want as a child.   My needs are met, my house is warm and dry.   I smile and appreciate all of it, my plants grow up and fill a garden that was bare in the winter, the grass is green and lush.   My bed is comfortable and warm, my coffee in the morning is hot and tasty.   I get to cut out of work early and go do what I want.  I can even take days off to go away to the places I like.   I have friends who I love to be around and we get to do things together that would make the child me exited for this future.  

But it feels empty without you.  

It makes me wonder.  If it was us, without any of the relationships, the house, the comfort that I‚Äôve created,  what would that feel like?  

The grass is always greener on the other side.  I‚Äôve learned this in life, more than once.  I know that it‚Äôs true.  So why then?  Why don‚Äôt I believe it now?   Why do I still feel it after all this time, that we are better together.   

Is it just me missing you?  I do, if that was ever a question.   I miss you more than I think I‚Äôve ever missed anything.   I can‚Äôt stop thinking about you, trust me I‚Äôve tried.  I miss hearing your voice in the morning.   I miss you making me lunch even when I said no.  I miss making you smile and laugh.  I miss you asking me questions that make me think.  I miss looking over and watching you work.  

Life just isn‚Äôt the same without you.   But I‚Äôm forced to live this bland version, everyday though it feels like I‚Äôm moving closer to the edge, willing to give up more if it would create a space to have you back.   

I should stop loving you. I should stop caring for you.   I should move on.  

Writing it out though, changes nothing.  

I do love you, more than you know.  I care about you more than you think.   And I haven‚Äôt moved on, not even a little bit.  ",4,1746467805.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1kfi4vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteResearch/comments/1kfi4vg/intranasal_delivery_of_mitochondria_targeted/,Intranasal Delivery of Mitochondria Targeted Neuroprotective Compounds for Traumatic Brain Injury,"üß† Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common medical emergencies that worsens rapidly without immediate treatment.  
üìä Approximately 4.8 million people are evaluated annually for TBI in US emergency departments.  
üè• An estimated 1.5 million Americans sustain a TBI each year, with 230,000 hospitalizations and about 50,000 deaths.  
‚ôø For moderate to severe TBI patients, about 80,000-90,000 people experience long-term disability.  
üî¨ Mitochondrial dysfunction is a shared immediate indicator of cellular damage across multiple preclinical TBI models.  
‚õî Currently, no therapeutic intervention is available as neuroprotective treatment for TBI.  
üèîÔ∏è The greatest obstacle to successful delivery of drug therapies to the CNS is the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  
üö´ The BBB prevents 98% of small and 100% of large molecules from entering the brain.  
üíä Even small molecules (<400 Dalton) must meet specific criteria (nonpolar and not multi-cyclic) to cross the BBB.  
‚ùå According to the FDA, over 90% of neuroprotective drugs tested for CNS diseases have not been approved due to poor bioavailability.  
## Mitochondrial Dysfunction in TBI
üîÑ Mitochondria regulate cellular homeostasis and have multifaceted functions essential for cell survival.  
‚ö° Secondary TBI cascades centrally regulated by mitochondria include excitotoxicity and calcium overload.  
üß¨ Membrane permeability transition, metabolic and bioenergetic failure follow mitochondrial damage.  
üõ°Ô∏è Antioxidant depletion, free radical overproduction, and oxidative stress result from mitochondrial injury.  
üî™ Elevated calpains, caspases, and apoptosis-inducing factors govern mitochondria-mediated neuronal damage.  
‚ùó Despite promising preclinical results with mitochondria-targeted drugs, they fail to translate to clinical success.  
## Advantages of Intranasal Delivery
üëÉ Intranasal drug delivery represents a non-invasive method for bypassing the BBB via the olfactory route.  
üîÑ Radio-labeled proteins administered intranasally distribute along trigeminal and olfactory nerve pathways.  
‚è±Ô∏è Within 30-60 minutes, intranasally-delivered compounds reach both rostral and caudal brain regions.  
üõ£Ô∏è The nasal route offers a direct path to the CNS via the highly-vascularized nasal mucosa.  
üèÉ Intranasal administration enables drugs to reach the brain more rapidly than conventional routes.  
üå°Ô∏è Higher concentrations can be achieved in the injured brain without incurring adverse systemic effects.  
üí™ In animal models, this route has successfully reduced stroke damage, reversed Alzheimer's neurodegeneration.  
üòå Intranasal delivery has also demonstrated reduced anxiety, improved memory, and delivery of neurotrophic factors.  
ü¶∫ This route offers significant advantages for military combat casualty care in austere environments.  
üíâ Intranasal delivery avoids pre-absorption metabolism, first-pass effect, and protein binding issues.  
## Key Mitochondria-Targeted Compounds for Intranasal Delivery
### NMN & NAD
üß™ Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a precursor of coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).  
‚öôÔ∏è NAD is a central coenzyme of redox reactions that restores mitochondrial function.  
‚è≤Ô∏è Short half-life (1-2 hours) makes intranasal delivery preferable over systemic routes.  
üß´ Preclinical studies showed intranasal NAD decreased brain injury in rodent models of transient focal ischemia.  
ü©∏ NMN attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage by suppressing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.  
### NACA
üß¨ N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) is a glutathione prodrug that reduces oxidative stress and improves mitochondrial bioenergetics.  
üîã NACA is a neutral, lipophilic compound with higher membrane permeability than its parent compound NAC.  
üß™ Unlike NAC (which is acidic), NACA is neutral with higher BBB bioavailability.  
ü©π Recent studies indicate NACA's nasal spray formulation is well-tolerated with a good safety profile.  
üß† Intranasal glutathione administration elevates brain glutathione levels in patients with Parkinson's disease.  
### MitoQ & SKQ1
‚ö° Mitoquinone (MitoQ) is a synthetic powerful mitochondria-targeted antioxidant compound.  
üß¨ Contains lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation to facilitate mitochondrial penetration.  
üß™ Similar compound SKQ1 has been tested intranasally with high penetration into brain tissue.  
üêÄ MitoQ has shown positive outcomes in animal models of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and TBI.  
üëç Preliminary safety studies in humans indicate MitoQ is safe and well-tolerated.  
### Curcumin
üåø Active component in turmeric with anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antioxidant effects.  
‚ö° Protects mitochondria from oxidative damage and attenuates neuronal apoptosis.  
üëÉ Intranasal delivery enhances curcumin's brain uptake efficiency in rodent models.  
üõ°Ô∏è Prevents cellular glutathione depletion and mitigates intracellular ROS generation.  
üçΩÔ∏è Safe for daily dietary use as established by WHO food standards.  
### Resveratrol
üçá Potent antioxidant derived from plants including grapes, wine, berries, and cocoa.  
üß¨ Linked to mitochondrial biogenesis through the SIRT1 metabolic regulatory pathway.  
üß† Protective in TBI, brain ischemia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease in preclinical studies.  
üëç Clinical trials have shown resveratrol supplementation is safe and well-tolerated.  
üëÉ Coating with chitosan dramatically increases CSF bioavailability when delivered intranasally.  
### Apelin-13
üî¨ A 13 amino acid oligopeptide that prevents mitochondrial depolarization and apoptotic events.  
ü©∏ Attenuates secondary injury after TBI by suppressing autophagy and preventing BBB disruption.  
‚è±Ô∏è Intranasal delivery addresses issues related to its short plasma half-life and poor bioavailability.  
üß™ Remarkably decreased cell death and improved long-term functional recovery in stroke models.  
üß† Provides non-invasive method for directly administering peptide therapy to the brain.  
### Quercetin
üåø Abundant polyphenolic flavonoid found in many plants, fruits, and vegetables.  
‚öôÔ∏è Modulates mitochondrial biogenesis, membrane potential, and ATP anabolism.
üçΩÔ∏è Found in red wine, onions, coffee, green tea, apples, and berries.  
üëé Poor solubility and limited oral absorption results in low bioavailability.  
üìà Nasal powder derivatives for intranasal delivery show superior CNS penetration.  
### DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP)
üíä Lipid-soluble, alkaline compound with long-lasting pharmacologic impact.
‚ö° Prevents oxidative damage and preserves mitochondrial function.  
‚úÖ FDA-approved in China for ischemic stroke treatment.  
üëÉ Daily intranasal NBP treatment provided protective and neurogenic effects after focal ischemic stroke in mice.  
üß† Promising for future applications in TBI treatment.  
## Formulation Considerations and Nanotechnology Approaches
### Critical Drug Properties
üìè Lower molecular weight and higher lipophilicity favor rapid intranasal uptake and brain delivery.  
üß™ Drug metabolism in the nasal cavity, degree of dissociation (pKa), and chemical structure affect absorption.  
‚è±Ô∏è Half-life impacts dosing frequency - compounds with shorter half-lives require more frequent dosing.  
üå°Ô∏è Physiologic pH of nasal mucosa is 5.0-7.0; compounds outside this range may cause irritation.  
üíß Hypotonic formulations improve drug permeability through nasal mucosa.  
### Nanotechnology Enhancements
üß¨ Chitosan: Cellulose-based biopolymer serves as penetration enhancer and for mucoadhesion.  
üìà Chitosan nanoemulsions significantly enhanced brain delivery of antioxidants (5 and 4.5-fold higher).  
üß† Histopathological examinations showed these nanoemulsions were safe for nasal mucosa.  
üîÑ Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs): Promising nanobiotechnology with unique surface area and hollow drug-loadable cavities.  
üõ°Ô∏è Multi-walled CNTs have shown neuroprotective effects via neurotrophic factor modulation.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns exist about potential cytotoxic effects of CNTs that must be addressed.  
### Mitochondrial Transplantation
üî¨ Intranasal delivery of mitochondria to the CNS is being explored as a novel therapeutic strategy.  
‚ö° Studies show mitochondria can enter brain meninges upon nasal delivery and undergo rapid cellular internalization.  
ü©π Replacement of damaged mitochondria with healthy ones may protect cells against further injury.  
üîã Healthy mitochondria directly delivered to defective neurons could reverse TBI pathogenesis.  
üß† Provides an effective transplantation strategy to restore brain energy metabolism.  
## Military and Battlefield Applications
ü™ñ Intranasal delivery is particularly relevant for battlefield applications in austere combat settings.  
üöë Over 80% of military-centric TBIs result from blast and/or impact concussion.  
üíâ Offers non-invasive alternative when parenteral routes are unavailable.  
üß¥ Doesn't require sterile conditions and can be self-administered.  
‚ö° The US Army has tested intranasal ketamine for pain management with promising results.  
üß™ Commercial preparations with built-in atomizers could be carried by warfighters.  
## Challenges and Future Directions
üî¨ Differences in nasal anatomy between animal models and humans complicate translation.  
üíß Limited volume that can be administered intranasally (optimal volume: 0.5-1ml per nostril).  
üß¨ Protection of compounds from nasal enzymes remains challenging.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Contraindications exist for patients with skull fractures affecting nasal cavity.  
üëÉ Nasal congestion or obstruction following TBI may impede delivery.  
üîÑ Better understanding of drug pathways after intranasal administration is needed.  
üß™ Development of improved delivery systems using nanotechnology is continuing.  
üêÄ Translation to larger animal models more representative of human physiology is essential.  
üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Clinical studies on the most promising compounds are still pending.
## Conclusions
üîë Mitochondrial-targeted drug delivery is achievable through the intranasal route.  
üëÉ Post-TBI intranasal administration of mitochondria-targeted compounds bypasses the BBB effectively.  
üíä Many neuroprotective compounds that failed through conventional routes are ideal candidates for intranasal delivery.  
ü©π This non-invasive, painless, simple delivery system offers significant clinical benefits.  
‚ö° Localizing drugs at their target site reduces systemic toxicity and increases treatment efficiency.  
üß™ While formulation limitations exist, further studies in TBI animal models are warranted.  
üîÑ Intranasal delivery offers opportunity to repurpose drugs previously abandoned due to BBB challenges.  
üåø Plant-derived compounds (phytochemicals) show particular promise for this delivery route.

\- Reputation for simplicity, lighter than metal options  
Concerns: Still plastic-based (though seemingly higher quality)  
Questions: Does the plastic maintain integrity after hundreds of uses? Any issues with the rubber seal degrading?

Alternative Options I'm Considering:  
GSI JavaPress: How does the durability compare to the above options?  
Stanley Classic Travel Press: Heavier, but potentially more robust?  
Porlex Mini Grinder paired with a simple metal pour-over cone

My Use Case:  
I'm not gentle with my gear. My coffee equipment needs to survive being:

\- Tossed in a backpack with other equipment  
\- Used in varying temperatures (sometimes below freezing)  
\- Occasionally dropped on rocky surfaces  
\- Cleaned imperfectly when water is limited

Has anyone put these brewers through similar conditions for extended periods? I'd particularly appreciate hearing about failure points you've encountered, or pleasant surprises regarding longevity.

1kfi0df,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1kfi0df/if_and_how_to_set_the_boundary/,if and how to set the boundary?,"i'm 31 my gf is 27. Been bf/gf for close to 3 months.

She has a former colleague who is a lot older than her. Around 45. They were pretty close at the time and they talked a lot during work since it was pretty stressful for her. Other than that he texted her a lot when her and i were just dating and i know for sure that he's trying to hook up with her. He was making sexual innuendos which she has told me about and he has complimented her body multiple times. 4-5 months ago he invited himself for coffee at her apartment and afterwards ""joked"" about next time ""we could have a sleep over ;)""..

My gf is pretty naive and at the time i told her ""hey he has no intention of being your friend - he's trying sleep with you and you know that"" plus some other things. She didn't think he was and that he was just joking.

Now to the issue. I was on he macbook earlier when she wasn't at home which she's ok with, but he texted her on imessage which popped up, that he misses her and ""remember you promised me we would see each other again.(after she left the job) are you free in week 20"".

I actually trust her. I know she's naive, so she will probably ask me if it's ok if she meets up with him for a coffee, but im not ok with that and i want to set a boundary when she asks. How do i do that properly?

Do i just tell her that im not comfortable with that since it's obvious that he's trying to sleep with her and that she should tell him no and that she has a boyfriend now(im not sure if he knows she has a boyfriend now).  I could tell her that ""what would you say if that hot girl from work asked me for coffee and i said yes?""     Should i be ok with them meeting up for a coffee at some spot down in the city?

if she is stubborn about him just wanting to be friends - is it ever ok to ask her to show me what he text her?  

What would you do in my situation? Thanks :)",1,1746467359.0,CoreyWayne,1,1.0,False
1kfhzsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kfhzsg/i_think_im_not_meant_for_love_or_a_happy/,I think I'm not meant for love or a happy relationship (venting),"When I was about 16 I started dating this guy because he asked me out and I had low self esteem and was desperate for attention in that way. I guess I also just thought it seemed right for me to start dating at my age and so I agreed to go out with him even though I cried and had a panic attack after he asked me and after I agreed to go out. It started out okay but he started to get more sexual which I wasn't really okay with, but I figured that was just part of a relationship. The first time we had sex, my parents were at a wedding but my brother was in the other room. I had told him that I thought I was ready (because he was moving faster and I was afraid of being left behind) and he went to buy protection. While he was gone I realized that I didn't want to do this and told him as much when he got back. He looked annoyed and said ‚Äúwell now I want to.‚Äù and kept pushing until I eventually gave in. After he left I felt disgusting and showered for probably an hour. I became extremely depressed during this relationship and a lot of my contamination OCD stems from some of the events that happened. He quickly became emotionally manipulative and started doing things without my consent. If I tried to confront him about it he would say he felt awful and cry so that I then ended up apologizing to him for making him feel bad. A lot of the specific stuff that happened I have kind of blocked out, but several times I remember thinking ‚Äúoh my god. I think that was assault/rape.‚Äù it got worse and worse until I finally broke it off with him. He wouldn't leave me alone though and so I dropped out of my high school (where I had a 4.0, was in leadership positions in many clubs, etc.). During this time I had isolated myself from my friends so I didn't really have anyone. My mental health got so bad that I became suicidal and almost attempted several times. My father made me attend a full time IOP and at that same time I stopped contact with my mother who was extremely emotionally abusive. In my IOP I knew a girl who was a lot like me and told me once ‚Äúman Im glad I'm not you because your life sounds awful man.‚Äù she killed herself a little bit later and I feel like shit for making that at all about me but I think about what she said a lot. I recently started dating this guy at my work as he was quitting. We were just supposed to hang out as friends but he tried to kiss me and I guess I was lonely and wanted love so I leaned into it even though I was panicking a little. I'm 18, he's 6 years older than me so part of that is why I was kinda freaking out. We ‚Äúdated‚Äù for a little bit, I told him I wanted to actually date him but he said that was moving too fast and we should be slow, but he still slept with me multiple times so I was confused about how it was slow. While we were sitting and watching a movie together one of his friends called him and told him that this girl at a bar thought he was hot and wanted to sleep with him, to which he responded ‚Äúthat would be awesome but probably not lol‚Äù. I felt bad about that because I wanted to actually be in a committed relationship with him especially since I'd only wanted to sleep with someone if they love me (things just happened really fast). I went home and later he called saying he felt stupid and wanted to talk. I went to coffee with him and he said he would never make me feel that way again so I kept ‚Äúdating‚Äù him. I was crying every day not knowing what's wrong with me, why can't I have someone actually love me and care about me. I called and told him eventually that I realized he didn't really give a shit about me and he barely argued. We talked in person and he then said that he decided he wasn't ready for a relationship so we could keep seeing each other in a non committed way or as friends. I just said I didn't want to talk to him. He told me during that time that he hopes I have some great romantic relationships in the future which kinda hurt because it solidified that he just did not see me as someone he was serious about in the slightest. Im having a hard time getting over him. I put in a lot of effort into that ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, I payed for every date, bought him flowers, drove everywhere. Maybe I'm just one of those people who's not meant for love but I'm just so tired and lonely now. I only really have one friend and were not super close. I feel used and disgusting and I know that this is a horrible thing to say because I would never shame anyone for sleeping with people but I feel awful and I don't want to. I always wanted a fairy tale romance or at least for someone to pretend they loved me. I want to be called pretty and feel pretty again. I just feel dirty now.

I‚Äôm narrowing down my plan for a coffee, pastries and cold sandwiches cart. I‚Äôd like to hire staff pretty early on in my plan because I just think this will be good for me and good to employ people in the community. 

One concern I have is for when a staff member is manning the cart, what security I should plan for them. I think the potential for verbal abuse, or worse is there and I‚Äôd like to be prepared to support my staff. But what‚Äôs possible for a cart? Is trying to set up video too much? Not enough? What have people experienced in terms of customer impropriety and how have you deal with it?

She's a bisexual trans woman who only dates cis women and trans men. So far so good, she's T4T when it comes to men and I totally understand why (cis straight men have a reputation for being violent when it comes to dating trans women, especially in my country). I feel like there's no harm in only dating trans men for these reasons. Her and I broke up over compatibility issues a little over a year ago and have remained very close friends.

But over the past 2 years I've noticed that her behavior when it comes to trans men is... concerning. Every time we meet a trans guy she immediately starts flirting with him, trying to date him. And I mean *every. single. time*. She's dated literally all the trans men she has ever met. I'm not exaggerating: every trans man that she knows has either been her boyfriend or at the very least they've slept together. Like even the way we met... I remember she sent me a message on instagram and she obviously knew I was trans from the very start, like she sought me out because of that...

I kept trying to ignore these thoughts, but last week we met a trans guy at a coffee shop and the moment we struck up a conversation with him I KNEW she would try to flirt in some way. Two days later she told me she had a crush on him and wants to ask him out.

The thought keeps popping up in my head: this reminds me of chaser behavior. I keep thinking, *shit*, if she was a cis man I'd be creeped out. Like, why is it that she has to date every trans man she meets? It makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes it feels like she's fetishizing trans men. But at the same time she's trans, so she can't be a chaser right? Like she's literally just T4T. Why does that make me uncomfy? Am I the one being weird?",3,1746466755.0,ftm,3,1.0,False

It can also be considered low according to the person's health status.

I could have an average of 83/55 and not experience any symptoms. That's just my average blood pressure. Labs and xrays came back all clean with no issues.

2) It's the same situation for high BP. If it's naturally low, the threshold for ""high"" BP would be lowered in those individuals. Also depends on health factors, such as kidney disease or stroke recovery.

I could have an average of 83/55, asymptomatic. Oh shoot, I drank too much coffee! That darn exam! Now I'm reading 123/85. How do I get this down? Doc says it's ""normal."" Ok, but it's NOT NORMAL FOR ME!!!!

Rent is $700 per month plus utilities (gas, electric and internet) that are shared between the roommates, roughly $70/mo per person. There is a background check that costs $50 and a move-in fee of $500 that should be pro-rated because you are subletting. I‚Äôve loved living in Humboldt, and the apartment has everything I need, but I will be moving out of state.

The apartment is on the east side of Humboldt Park, and if you don‚Äôt know anything about the area, I think it‚Äôs awesome. Lots of lovely restaraunts on Division and also California, the climbing gym nearby, and the huge park that‚Äôs nice in so many ways. Can take either Division or California bus to quickly reach the Blue line train.

The living room is spacious with a nice view of the trees from the third storey. Some nice couches as well. The kitchen has a large fridge and freezer / oven / dishwasher / toaster oven / coffee maker / microwave. In unit washer and dryer. The apartment is also pet friendly! (though one of the current roommates is allergic to cats). There is also a parking space available to one person in the unit, which will be available August 1st.

My room is roughly 10.5 ft by 9 ft, with a small closet I currently use for my desk. My bed is a queen size bed, so you can use the same configuration I had or have more space if you have a smaller bed. I‚Äôm also willing to sell my bedframe (or other things) if you‚Äôre interested.

1kfhogz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterManifestor/comments/1kfhogz/the_sensorial_flux_method/,THE SENSORIAL FLUX METHOD‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ô®Ô∏èüê¶‚Äçüî•ü™≠,"
This method is an immersive approach that taps into **your five senses** to unlock the deepest layers of your subconscious mind and effortlessly **align your reality** with your desires. It‚Äôs a new technique that creates immediate, long-lasting connections between your desired appearance and the sensory experiences you already encounter in your daily life.
This method taps into your **everyday sensory input**‚Äîthings you‚Äôre constantly interacting with‚Äîtransforming them into an anchor for your transformation. Your senses are far more powerful than you realize, and when aligned with your desires, they **become unstoppable reprogramming tools**.

---

### **HOW THE SENSORIAL FLUX METHOD WORKS:**

#### **1. Choose Your Sensory Anchor (The Daily Input)**

You already experience sensory input every single day. You smell scents, hear sounds, touch textures, see sights, and taste things constantly. The first step is to choose **one** sensory experience you‚Äôre already exposed to on a daily basis.

The sensory anchor could be:

* **Smell**: The scent of your favorite perfume, a flower, freshly brewed coffee, food, nature, etc.
* **Sound**: The music you listen to, nature sounds (rain, wind), your favorite voice, or even the sound of traffic.
* **Sight**: Looking at certain objects, places, or your own reflection in the mirror.
* **Touch**: The feeling of a certain fabric, the temperature of water, the breeze on your skin, or the softness of a pillow.
* **Taste**: The taste of your favorite food or drink, which will trigger your transformation.

This anchor should be something that is **already present** in your life, something that you **already engage with daily**.

---

#### **2. Connect Your Desired Appearance to the Sensory Anchor**

Now that you‚Äôve chosen your sensory anchor, the goal is to **associate** this sensory experience directly with your desired physical transformation. You need to rewire your brain by merging your desired body/appearance with the sensory input in a way that makes sense on an emotional and subconscious level.

For instance, let's say you‚Äôre manifesting a **slimmer body**. Every time you experience your chosen sensory anchor‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the **smell of your morning coffee** or the **sound of your favorite song**‚Äîyou will **immediately associate** it with the **experience of being slim**.

**Example:**

* **Anchor:** The smell of your favorite coffee
* **Transformation:** You breathe in the aroma and **feel** your waistline growing slimmer, your stomach flattening, your thighs shrinking. You feel the shift happening as you breathe, like your body effortlessly morphing into your desired form.
* **How It Feels:** Every inhale of that coffee scent reinforces the idea that you‚Äôre becoming slim, naturally, without any effort, as if the smell itself is making the change happen.

The key is to **feel** the transformation **happening in real-time**. You‚Äôre not just thinking about it‚Äîyou are **sensing** it, as if your desired appearance is an inevitable consequence of this sensory experience.

---

#### **3. Repeat the Anchor-Transformation Cycle 3‚Äì5 Times a Day**

This method works best when you **regularly** and **consistently** repeat the cycle. After all, **repetition is the key to forming new subconscious beliefs**.

At least **3‚Äì5 times a day**, engage in your sensory experience and immediately pair it with your desired appearance.

**Example of Consistent Practice:**

* **Morning:** As you drink your morning coffee (or any other drink), you **feel** your ideal body shape. Your stomach feels flatter, your arms slimmer, and your skin smoother. This sensory anchor is now the key to **unlocking** your transformation.
* **Afternoon:** When you listen to your favorite music or a calming sound, **feel** your desired appearance locking into place, as if each note or sound is changing your body.
* **Evening:** When you touch something soft like a pillow or fabric, **sense** your skin becoming smooth and radiant. Imagine it as your skin absorbing the soft touch, transforming itself.

---

#### **4. Forget the Old Identity and Keep the Focus on the Transformation**

Here‚Äôs where this method becomes extraordinarily powerful: while you engage with your sensory anchors, you are training your subconscious mind to **forget the old version** of yourself. The more you associate your desired appearance with **positive, sensory-rich experiences**, the more your subconscious **accepts** that transformation is inevitable.

By **consistently connecting your senses to the desired change**, your mind stops seeing the old version as *true* because it no longer associates the old version with those sensory experiences.

You‚Äôre not just telling yourself, ""I‚Äôm transforming."" You are **experiencing** transformation every time you engage with your sensory anchors, making your body and mind **forget** the old version of you.

---

#### **5. Experience Your New Appearance in Real-Time**

The final step is to allow yourself to fully experience your transformation as you engage with your sensory anchor. Each moment spent interacting with it is a **powerful reminder** that the desired change is already complete.

---

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Everpure water filter system is known for its advanced filtration technology and durable construction. Their systems are designed to remove a wide range of contaminants, improving both the taste and safety of your water.

**NSF Certification**

Everpure products undergo rigorous testing and certification by NSF International, a leading independent organization that develops public health standards and certification programs. This certification ensures that Everpure filter systems meet stringent performance standards for contaminant reduction, material safety, and structural integrity. This rigorous certification process means that when Everpure claims to remove a certain contaminant, you can be confident that it does so effectively.

**Micro-PureÂ∫ê II Filtration Technology**

EverpureÈà•Ê™ö proprietary Micro-PureÂ∫ê II filtration technology is a key component of their filter cartridges. This technology uses a unique blend of activated carbon and other filtration media to effectively reduce chlorine taste and odor, dirt, rust, asbestos fibers, and other particulate matter. The Micro-PureÂ∫ê II also inhibits the growth of bacteria within the filter cartridge, ensuring consistent and reliable performance over the filter's lifespan.

**Precoat Submicron Technology**

Many Everpure filter cartridges incorporate precoat submicron technology. This advanced filtration process uses a tightly packed filter membrane to remove particles as small as 0.5 microns in size. This submicron filtration capability effectively reduces contaminants like cysts (Cryptosporidium and Giardia), which can cause waterborne illnesses. The precoat design also maximizes the surface area available for filtration, resulting in longer filter life and higher flow rates.

**Durable Construction and Design**

Everpure systems are built to last, using high-quality materials and robust construction techniques. The filter housings are typically made from durable plastic or stainless steel, designed to withstand high water pressure and temperature fluctuations. The cartridge replacement process is also straightforward and user-friendly, with many systems featuring a quick-change cartridge design that allows for easy and mess-free filter replacement.

Key features of the Everpure water filter system include:

*   NSF Certification for contaminant reduction
*   Micro-PureÂ∫ê II filtration technology
*   Precoat submicron technology
*   Durable construction and design

 ## Core Benefits

Everpure water filter systems offer a range of benefits, from improved water quality to enhanced convenience and cost savings. These systems are designed to provide clean, safe, and great-tasting water for a variety of applications.

**Improved Water Quality**

The primary benefit of an Everpure water filter system is the significant improvement in water quality. By effectively removing contaminants such as chlorine, sediment, lead, and cysts, Everpure filters ensure that you are drinking water that is cleaner and safer. This enhanced water quality not only protects your health but also improves the taste and odor of your water, making it more enjoyable to drink.

**Enhanced Convenience**

Everpure systems are designed for convenience, offering a continuous supply of filtered water directly from your tap or dedicated faucet. This eliminates the need to purchase bottled water or use cumbersome pitcher filters. The ease of use and consistent water quality make Everpure systems a convenient and reliable solution for your daily hydration needs.

**Cost Efficiency**

While the initial investment in an Everpure water filter system may seem significant, it can actually be more cost-effective in the long run compared to purchasing bottled water. The filter cartridges have a long lifespan, and the cost per gallon of filtered water is significantly lower than the cost of bottled water. Additionally, by reducing the consumption of bottled water, you are also contributing to a more sustainable environment by reducing plastic waste.

**Appliance Protection**

Hard water and sediment can damage your appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, and shorten their lifespan. By providing filtered water, Everpure systems can help to prevent scale buildup and sediment accumulation in your appliances, extending their lifespan and reducing the need for costly repairs or replacements. This is especially beneficial for appliances that use water regularly, such as ice makers and espresso machines.

**Peace of Mind**

Knowing that your water is being filtered by a trusted and reliable system like Everpure provides peace of mind. Whether you are concerned about the presence of specific contaminants in your water supply or simply want to ensure that you are drinking the cleanest water possible, an Everpure system offers a reliable solution that you can trust.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about Everpure water filter systems.

**How often do I need to replace the filter cartridge?**

The replacement frequency of Everpure filter cartridges depends on several factors, including the specific filter model, the amount of water used, and the quality of the incoming water. As a general guideline, most Everpure cartridges are designed to last for approximately 6 to 12 months. Some models also have a flow rate indicator that alerts you when it's time to replace the cartridge. Always refer to the manufacturer's recommendations for your specific filter model.

**Can Everpure filters remove lead from water?**

Yes, many Everpure filter cartridges are specifically designed to reduce lead levels in drinking water. These filters typically use a combination of activated carbon and other filtration media to effectively remove lead particles and dissolved lead from the water. Look for filter models that are NSF certified for lead reduction to ensure optimal performance.

**Are Everpure systems compatible with well water?**

Everpure systems are primarily designed for use with municipal water supplies. While some models may be suitable for well water, it is important to have your well water tested to determine its specific characteristics and contaminant levels. Well water often contains higher levels of sediment, bacteria, and other contaminants that may require additional pre-filtration or specialized treatment. Consult with a water treatment professional to determine the best filtration solution for your well water.

**Do Everpure systems require professional installation?**

While some Everpure systems can be easily installed by homeowners with basic plumbing skills, others may require professional installation. The complexity of the installation process depends on the specific model and the existing plumbing configuration. For under-sink systems that require connecting to your water supply line and installing a dedicated faucet, professional installation is often recommended to ensure proper connections and prevent leaks.

he hardly ever cleans the fucking kitchen, despite making himself snacks and shit. the kitchen is almost always a mess because of him and its always up to me or my mom to clean it up. i can't say anything to either of them because it'll just turn into unproductive arguement and it'll end with me fuming.

this man is allowed to make all sorts of messes in the place we keep our food, but if my room's unorganized then it's an issue. im fucking sick of this and i can't wait to move out so i don't have to constantly clean up after his ass.

‚Ä¢ Stevie Wonder ‚Äî Songs in the Key of Life (2x LP + 7"" bonus single);  
‚Ä¢ Stevie Wonder ‚Äî Talking Book (1x LP); and  
‚Ä¢ Rankin Bass' 1977 Soundtrack for 'The Hobbit' (2x LP).  

I wanted to get them cleaned ultrasonically. My Spincare did a good job but there was still surface noise, especially on the 7"". I can't justify the expense of an ultrasonic right now. But at ¬£2 per record I couldn't really argue with it as an experiment with my local.  

An hour (and a coffee) later and I was off home again (with 2x new purchases as well). I popped on the 7"" immediately as it was the worst and it was A NIGHT AND DAY difference. It sounds SOOOO clean now. Practically all surface noise gone. I have to wait until tomorrow to listen to the others during my WFH day, as I relinquished the turntable so my daughter could spin her new Lady Gaga. But early indications are SUPER impressive.  

If you're on the fence, DO IT. Find a local shop offering it as a service if you can't justify buying one yourself.

Verdict: delicious. Egglets are made with brioche bread so it‚Äôs got a really nice mix of sweet and salty. Nice quality bacon. Eggs are cage free. Default cheese is cheddar but you can swap for: Swiss, mozzarella, Gouda, etc. Includes cabbage for a super nice crunch balance. And I really nice sauce I can‚Äôt put my finger on. A total guilty pleasure. 

Add-on options include: sausage, truffle hash browns, egg truffle salad, ham, fried egg, dip cheese, bacon

There are also combo meal/drink options.

The vibe is very futuristic: Hong Kong or Tokyo. You can order directly from a terminal as you walk in or in-person from the server at the counter.

They also serve a variety of sandwiches (chicken, egg salad, shrimp, and burgers (plant and meat) and a special Korean BBQ cheeseburger (barbecue beef, over medium egg, carmelized onions, dip cheese, mozzarella)

Drinks: variety of beer, sodas, waters, coffees

Open 7am-2pm daily.

And to finish it off: Korean ice cream and Macaron ice cream.

The staff is SUPER friendly. Bonus - the K-Pop videos on the big screen.

Should I listen to her?,"I am a sophomore in college and have been close with one of my friends, I‚Äôll call her Bianca, since middle school. We have always been very flirty with each other but nothing has happened between us before. Since we left for separate colleges we have been made it a habit to get coffee and talk in the car for a while with each other. I have always really enjoyed spending time with her and we will also hang out with a mutual girl friend of hers that we‚Äôre both close to.

This past fall she broke up with her longtime, long distance boyfriend, and we have slowly but surely talking more and getting closer after. When we were home for winter we ended up hanging out all the time both in groups or just together.

Near the end of the break we went to a bar with friends, and while the two of us were getting drinks our mutual friend asked my best friend a couple questions, ‚Äúdoes he still like her?‚Äù And ‚Äúif she made a move on him within the next‚Ä¶ couple years, would he go for it?‚Äù My friend refused to answer the former and said yes to the latter. She explained to him she really wanted it to happen but we came back before they could keep talking about it.

A couple months later I visited the two of them at their college, and when I had a minute alone with our mutual friend I drunkenly brought up my feelings for Bianca, and she asked me questions like ‚Äúdo you really like her?‚Äù And ‚Äúso you would do long distance?‚Äù, but Bianca came back before we could keep talking.

However, when I have brought up these conversations with my mutual friend when we were sober, she‚Äôs claimed she doesn‚Äôt remember them and that Bianca does not have feelings for me. She didn‚Äôt sound too sure when we talked about it the first time but was much more firm about it after the second.

Naturally I was pretty beat to hear that and thought that was it, but since that winter break and my visit to see them Bianca and I have only gotten closer. Although she became a little distant for the last few days of winter break after the bar (so I think she did hear about what my friend said), we have since grown to talk everyday, she sends me photos in all her makeup and whatnot before going out, and we‚Äôve only grown to flirt more and talk about all aspects of our day.

I really enjoy talking and spending time with her, and my gut tells me that the feelings are mutual, but it‚Äôs hard to look past what her friend straight up told me. And I don‚Äôt want to potentially ruin our friendship. Obviously I won‚Äôt know the answer until we‚Äôre back home and hang out, but with my friend seemingly responding to the topic differently when she‚Äôs sober and drunk, I was wondering if there could be more to the story. Bianca has always been very private when it comes to her relationships, is there any realistic possibility that her friend might not of been telling me the truth? I have asked my other girl friends their thoughts and they have mixed feelings on whether I should believe her or not. ",2,1746465653.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1kfh9ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kfh9ro/does_the_ispring_whole_house_water_filter_wgb32bm/,Does the iSpring Whole House Water Filter WGB32BM Review Meet Your Expectations?,"Testing out the iSpring WGB32BM Whole House Water Filter System has been a unique experience for me. The idea of installing a water filtration system to cover my entire home's water supply piqued my curiosity, and after using it for weeks, I have quite a bit to say. This three-stage filtration workhorse by iSpring is specifically designed to rid water of iron, manganese, and other impurities while keeping essential minerals intact. The large size and hefty weight immediately caught my attention when unboxing it‚Äî55 pounds of pure, functional engineering! The product dimensions at 24.25 x 7.75 x 27.75 inches might intimidate some, but trust me, it fits neatly if you have some planning in place. Let me walk you through how this system runs, shines, and where it might hang back a little.

**Innovative Filtration Features**  
The internal mechanics of this water filter system are truly impressive. On a day-to-day basis, I‚Äôve appreciated the 3-stage filtration, particularly stage three with the FM25B iron water filter. Living in an area with high iron content in the water supply, the ability to reduce iron levels up to 3.0 ppm is beyond helpful. Beyond that, the second stage carbon block filter‚Äîwith coconut shell carbon‚Äîreally works to eliminate chlorine and enhance flavor, a win for someone like me who‚Äôs picky about the smell and taste of tap water. While there‚Äôs no reduction in Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), as clarified in the description, the healthy minerals remaining in the water are something I value.

**DIY Installation and Maintenance**  
Let me say that assembling this system was less complicated than I expected. Equipped with a clear manual and supportive YouTube tutorials, the process was pretty straightforward. I will admit, lugging around the 55-pound unit wasn‚Äôt an easy task, so having a friend or relative assist could save you a lot of physical strain. Once installed, the system‚Äôs maintenance seems surprisingly low-effort. The cartridges, each rated for 100,000 gallons of water, ensure my family of four has sufficient filtered water for about a year. Coupled with its ability to handle a maximum flow rate of 15 GPM, this system supports our needs without compromising on water flow‚Äîa standout point other units I‚Äôve tried haven‚Äôt matched.

[Grab iSpring WGB32BM at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01fi3blym/)

**Advantages**  
This product offers some standout qualities that make it worth considering:  
- The high-capacity polypropylene sediment filter works down to 5 microns for thorough filtration.  
- Water maintains necessary minerals, ensuring it‚Äôs both healthy and clean.  
- Impressive 100,000-gallon filter lifespan means infrequent cartridge replacements.  
- Independent NSF/ANSI certifications guarantee quality.  
- Minimal impact on water pressure, even in demanding households.  

**Caveats**  
That being said, there are areas where the filter could see improvement:  
- At 55 pounds, its weight may be a challenge during installation without extra help.  
- Lack of TDS reduction might be a dealbreaker for customers in regions with high dissolved solids.  
- Not ideal for rental properties since the installation is permanent.  

**Built for Busy Homes**  
Given its specifications, this model is clearly aimed at medium to large households that depend on high water volumes. Its compatibility with a permanent installation makes it perfect for homeowners who want to enhance their primary water supply line. Families in areas where iron and manganese are frequent nuisances will find this system invaluable. I imagine if you're a tea or coffee enthusiast like me, or someone with sensitive skin who notices the effects of iron in water, you'll grow fond of this system's filtration prowess.

**Market Rivals**  
I had previously tried alternatives like the Aquasana Rhino Whole House Filter and Pentair‚Äôs Pelican Water Systems. While those are decent products, they didn‚Äôt fare as well in areas I cared about most. Aquasana filters didn‚Äôt properly handle the iron content compared to the iSpring WGB32BM, and its filter lifespan wasn‚Äôt nearly as competitive. Pelican systems lean towards water softening and don‚Äôt directly solve the issue of manganese and rust, which was a constant headache for me. However, Aquasana edged out in its sleeker design and Pentair impressed me with its salt-free approach to water conditioning. The iSpring, however, shines for balancing function, longevity, and practicality all at once.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Evaluating the cost of this product in comparison to its features, it‚Äôs evident that the investment delivers high value. Many water filters come with shorter filter lifespans and less rigorous certification. Add to that the reduced cost of hiring a contractor‚Äîthanks to the DIY-friendly setup‚Äîand I feel the iSpring model lands squarely in the category of smart spending. It‚Äôs not cheap upfront, but the replacement frequency and operation savings validate the price for me. Over time, that value just multiplies.

This is a true story, even if I'm straining my memory a little bit! Any writing pointers appreciated, and questions welcomed.

**WARTORN CHARIZARD**

¬†

The year was 1999. Life was simple for a 9 year old. We had school during the weekdays, and soccer some evenings. If I wasn‚Äôt at the soccer field, I could be found at the park with my two close friends Brandyn and Amanda ‚Äì just being kids. The park was where I learned a lot of life‚Äôs valuable lessons. ¬†There were a lot of us kids at the park, and we played with them all to a degree but the three of us were the tightest crew of true friends among them. We came from a lower middle class neighboorhood so as much as it wasn‚Äôt what some might view as the ‚Äúghetto‚Äù, the kids definitely weren‚Äôt alright. Amanda was a year older so always the voice of reason and the wisdom we lacked, and Brandyn was 3 years younger, and my ‚Äúapprentice‚Äù as I called him. I taught him so many of those life lessons that I‚Äôd learned on a fast track and he was beyond his years because of it. I even taught him how to pee outside on that land apparently which he thanked me for a few decades later, akwardly enough.

¬†Then it happened. Pokemon. Overnight that‚Äôs all anyone ever cared about anymore. It came into our lives changing the dynamic of everything we did. Pokemon cards were the new currency, and everyone‚Äôs collection became their self-worth. Everyone knew who had which, how many, and how they got them. I know it was an obsession at first, but looking back it resembled more of a widespread addiction. At school, it started getting serious fast. People‚Äôs cards started going missing, and it escalated quickly. You couldn‚Äôt even take your eyes off of your Pokemon cards because if they weren‚Äôt in your pocket, or they were as good as gone. People started playing ‚Äúfor keeps‚Äù. This was a game invented by the sharks because no one had a hot clue how to actually play the game. Atleast not as far as I know. If you played for keeps with the sharks, they essentially knew they were taking your cards. They would use their best Pokemon and promise that you keep him if you won, but they knew that the ‚Äúrules‚Äù would allow them a victory because they just knew how to do the quick math necessary to guaratee themselves a win. ‚ÄúAw shucks, guess I win‚Äù . They were worse than a casino. These situations started degrading into fist fights over Pokemon cards, and the incidents were becoming daily. The worst one I heard was that a kid got stabbed over a Pokemon at the next school over, according to some kids at the park who went there.

¬†

The school cracked down hard. No Pokemon cards at school. This sucked for me because at this point, despite not having a ton of cards that I‚Äôd actually bought ‚Äì I‚Äôd made a lot of nice lateral moves to get myself a nice stack. My parents didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, and didn‚Äôt buy me much but if there was ever the odd reason to get anything it would be a pack of cards. ¬†And no, I wasn‚Äôt apart of any of that other stuff I mentioned above to get this deck. I may have known who did this or that from time to time‚Ä¶ but I was never a thief or a con man. Just a hard nosed negotiator who learned how to leverage what people wanted for a net gain. Despite all of my hard work, now it‚Äôs being taken away from me. ¬†

¬†

What I found out quickly though is that this was bigger than the authorities. We didn‚Äôt stop, and we couldn‚Äôt stop. We just went dark. Before the crack down we could walk the halls slapping our friend in the face with our new holographic Bulbosaur. Now we just needed to show them discreetly. We used to make trades in school line-ups, but now we can make our trades under the structure or in the corner of the school yard. It was prohibition rules, and we were all speaking easy. This was Pokemania.

¬†

Summer break came around and Pokemon continued to be the focal point at the park. Me and my two best friends spent days slinging trades to anyone and everyone, trying to maximize our decks. Ok, maybe Brandyn got ripped off a few times when I wasn‚Äôt around but he was 6 and had no clue what he was doing. It‚Äôs a dog eat dog world out there. Out of the blue I found out that my cousin was moving in to the house next to me. I didn‚Äôt know him very well, but I knew of him and was excited to welcome him to the neighborhood. He was a year younger than me, and when I saw him that first day he had a pink Mohawk. He quickly joined our group of friends and we justifiably called him Pinky.

¬†

Pinky was rough around the edges, and didn‚Äôt have the greatest childhood. He didn‚Äôt know his dad, and his mom was still in her party phase and moved them around a lot. He was a really good guy when you went beyond the first layer and he took to our group pretty quickly. There was friction I‚Äôd need to calm now and again, because he was the epidemy of a straight shooter. ¬†But it was ok. He was an old soul mixed with misguided youth. At the time he knew about Pokemon but he had enough on his plate where he never really took the time get into it. That all changed at the park. One day he convinced his mom to buy him his first pack of cards. I walked with them to the 7-11 a street over and we opened it in the back lane on the walk back. As he opens up the pack I can see something shining red at the front. As I look closer, I realize it‚Äôs a holographic Charizard. I lost my mind, screaming at the top of my lungs in the back lane. Let‚Äôs just say I made sure he understood this was the best Pokemon card he could have ever asked for, especially being the first one he ever owns. ¬†

¬†

I spent days trying to trade for this card. He had a mere handful of cards, and I had a binder full of valuable cards, with a deck to back it up. I wanted him to know the value of this card as not to rip him off ‚Äì but I otherwise knew I had to make a deal for this card. I was going to jumpstart his collection big time with numerous holographics, mid range, low end etc. He could have went from nothing to a chunk of my collection overnight. But this cat wouldn‚Äôt budge. Weeks went by and nothing I offered him was enough. He was making trades off of his other cards and I realized quickly that this guy is a better deal maker than me. He‚Äôs the type of guy that can trade a paper clip and eventually turn it into a car. I was amazed at how well he took to this game.

¬†

A few weeks later I see him in his back yard and he tells me he has to show me something after dinner. We meet up at the park after dinner and HE PULLS OUT A HUGE STACK OF CARDS. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It was as big as mine and he had pulled it off in maybe a month. I needed to see what he had in there, so I take it and right at the front is a Holographic Charizard. This one looks different though. It has a big ugly crease through the middle and it has some wear on it. As my brain is trying to catch up to all of the adrenaline, I catch that this one has the coveted first edition stamp on the side. It‚Äôs a different card. I lose my mind just like I did in the back lane a month earlier. Everyone knows that the only thing better than a holographic charizard, is a 1^(st) edition . He explains that he managed to trade his mint Charizard to another kid, who was willing to give up his bent and weathered one as well as a big stack of great cards in order to get it done. It wasn‚Äôt far from the offer I was giving, but he still had a Charizard under his belt so the deal made sense. That‚Äôs fair logic in my mind, but I was back at it again.

¬†

I spent weeks trying to get him to move it. Remember when I said that I leveraged what people wanted to make a gain? And when I said that he might be better at this than me? Well let‚Äôs just say I was right. We got the deal done, and he made out like a bandit. He officially had more than me and maybe that‚Äôs all he ever wanted. I could tell he was pulling this thing out and letting people hold it, and play with it because the condition was slightly worse than before, but I didn‚Äôt care. I had my own 1^(st) Edition holographic Charizard and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.

¬†

I made sure everyone knew what I had and showed it off any chance I could. It was a big deal to be the only guy around to have this card. Yes it was a little bit beat up, but it was the one card no one else could find. That‚Äôs until one day when I also couldn‚Äôt find it.

¬†

¬†I opened up my collection one evening to take a good look at all my cards and plan my next set of moves. Where my Charizard was usually kept, it was gone. It‚Äôs not common I take it anywhere, but maybe I left it on the coffee table, or in the kitchen? I looked everywhere. I ripped my whole room apart and then the house. Thing is, even when I took it somewhere I learned the valuable lesson early to never leave your cards around. This thing was always in my binder and never out of sight when I was on the move. I would rarely take it out of the binder and only let my closest friends see it out because of how protective I was about it. I couldn‚Äôt understand how it could just vanish like this. I was heartbroken. But then a theory dawned on me.

¬†

The next day at the park I called a meeting with my closest friends Brandyn and Amanda. I‚Äôm not sure where Pinky was, but I recall that he couldn‚Äôt be there for whatever reason. I explained the situation to them, and they were shocked because they knew how much this card meant to me and how well I protected it. Then I ran my theory by them to see if I was over thinking anything.

¬†

You see, I had a friend over the day before I noticed the card missing.¬† His name was Steve and a regular at the park. In fact, he lived in the house right beside the park and if he wasn‚Äôt there, could have very well been looking out his window watching us during this very talk. When I use the word friend, I use it very lightly because we all knew Steve was a bit‚Ä¶ sketchy. He just happened to be at the park as much as us, so we‚Äôd see him damn near every day. For that reason we maybe got together outside of the park a few times a year. ¬†When I had him over, I remember we were hanging out in my room. I had to use the washroom so I left, and when I came back he said he had to get going home and abruptly left. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it at the time, because we all have ‚Äútime limits‚Äù or other things we want to do, so whatever. He was always a bit of ¬†a weird kid, so not really off brand for him.

¬†

When I explained that to my friends, the wisdom of Amanda took over. She was convinced that Steve had to have taken the card. Brandyn loved chaos so he was ready to jump on that theory as well, and wanted his head. Steve had recently broken his bedroom light and a few of Brandyn‚Äôs toys (and one of mine) so he was very much biased. I wanted to see the good in everyone, and kept telling myself there must be another explanation for it. I kept ripping apart new corners of my house every night but at the end of the day, my gut was still telling me that Steve had something to do with it. Unfortunately there was nothing I could really do about it. I‚Äôve been to his house maybe a few times ever, and without laying eyes on it he would never admit to it. I knew I couldn‚Äôt just give up like that though.

¬†

I decided that the obvious place to start was to approach Steve and see if I can catch him slipping. I knew asking him about it directly, or even accusing him of it would just give him every reason to avoid me so I had to be careful. I casually mention to him that I can't find my Charizard anywhere, and how hard I've been trying to find it. He plays dumb, just like I expected but he gave me enough of that subtle nervousness that I was looking for. And just like that, it's on.

¬†

I'm at the drawing board with Brandyn and Amanda trying to hatch something up when it dawned on me. I'm going to smoke him out. My friend Amanda had just gotten a new printer at home, and we needed to learn how to use it fast. With some effort we were able to type up and print out dozens of various ""Missing"" signs with a emphasis on the crease in the middle, and what it meant to me. I even offered a cash reward on some of them to give him an ""out"" that he had maybe hunted it down for the money. Now as much as we would put them all down our street, we made a focus on the area directly around his house. It was painfully obvious that his house was a hot spot. There was a tree somewhat in front of his house and that one got 3 different posters. The next day I noticed they were torn down, while the other ones were mostly in tact. He was feeling the heat. The printer ran hot that day, and they went right back up. We ran through this cat and mouse game a few times before a surprising twist happens.

¬†

Brandyn took it upon himself, and spray painted the side of Steve's dad's car. I had no idea of his intentions to do this, and I doubt he had even planned this whatsoever. The way I understand it is that Brandyn was over there hanging out with Steve and a few other kids after playing at the park, when he took the opportunity to strike. He snuck into the garage and did the deed. This one actually got pretty ugly because the police got involved and Brandyn denied it until he was blue in the face. No one actually witnessed him do it, but all of the kids agreed that it couldn't have been any of them, and Brandyn was the only one who had separated from the group. Someone also said they saw him coming out of the garage, which put him in a very bad spot. I actually liked Steve's dad to be honest, but war is war. Brandyn had learned enough from me at this point, and was able to remain brave in the face of the persecution. Their parents were fighting about it, but he never broke his claim of innocence and they couldn't formally prove that he had done it. A guilty 6 year old couldn't possibly withstand a police interrogation right? The case was closed.

¬†

Weeks went by. I was giving up hope at this point. This was getting out of control and starting to negatively affect my life, and the lives of others. The posters were littering the neighborhood. One evening out of the blue my mother came to my room and says:

¬†

""Hey, I just got off the phone with Danielle (Steve's mom). She said that you've been posting a bunch of signs around her house for your missing pokey-man card?""

¬†

Oh great, here we go. ""Yeah....""

¬†

""Well she said she found it, and that little jerk Steve was the one who took it. She's on her way to return it"".

¬†

I hit the roof. The plan had worked! After a short happy dance, Danielle stormed up to our door apologizing profusely, and visibly angry. Actually it was very angry, to the point where she may have very well beat his ass right before she walked over. Not only did she have my card, but she had a grocery bag filled with his entire collection as well! He lived probably 20 houses down from me and in that moment, at least in my mind - I felt like I could hear him crying. I could feel him crying. While I flipped through my newly found loot, every card I held was a piece of his soul. All of those cards combined were still not as important as my having 1st Edition Charizard back though. It was a moment of glory I'll never forget.

¬†

The card was beaten up further unfortunately, but I was just happy it was home. This card had been places and seen things at this point. This card was just... War Torn.

My husband never realized that his mom was lowkey a narcissist until a little over a year ago. He has tried explaining to her how he feels on things that happened in his childhood and she either disregards them, denies it happening, or starts crying to get him to comfort her. We are now expecting our second child (33w pregnant, almost 34w). He said before our next baby is born he wants to text her how she has made him feel and explain how she failed as a parent. 

I told him I feel like he has done that already in the past and it has not changed her behavior or outlook on things. He is pretty set on doing it and doing it via text so he can put everything out there. I am just worried he will be hurt from the outcome of it. 

My husband is very hard on himself, even now. He is constantly apologizing for the smallest things. Like even with spilling water he calls himself an idiot and hits his head, I always assure him it's okay and there's nothing that can't be fixed.

And this is a trend I am seeing more in America 

Any form of social entertainment has become very monetized. Go to a concert to see a famous artist? It‚Äôs going to be $300 for nosebleed seats. And then you are expected to pay service fees and other fees that aren‚Äôt talked about up front on top of taxes. When you are at the concert, a beer will cost $16, an orange juice will cost $8, and a slice of pizza is $20. 

Want to meet a friend somewhere to socialize? Coffee is $7. Want Indian food in america? $14 for a benne masala dosa. Naan sabzi? $15 for the sabzi and $6 for the garlic naan. If you think Indian food is too expensive in india, you should see the prices of pizza- it‚Äôs easily $50 for a large pizza for a family of four

Rent an apartment in america? Based upon the day you sign the lease and how long the lease is for, the rent you will pay changes. 12 month lease you pay more a month while 15 month lease you‚Äôll pay less but this can depend. You might need to write a script in Python to find out the optimal rate. And to proceed you need to pay $50 for an application to see if you are approved 

And then there are the extra charges- Sure you can rent an apartment for this each month but American landlords don‚Äôt tell you all the extra things you gotta pay for. If you live in a multi plex apartment, you‚Äôll not only pay for your apartment utilities but you‚Äôll also pay for concierge fees(the price to pay for all the lights and common amenities the apartment has and that can be close to $200 a month), parking spot fees(which can be $100-200 a month if you live in a city), and you have to put down a security deposit(which is $600) which tends to get taken by the landlord for move in and move out cleaning fees and other reasons. 

And once the lease is up, landlords will most likely increase the rent and you need to decide if it is worth it to stay or pay movers to move your belongings to a new location and maybe do a cost comparison 

Want to have a child in America? You‚Äôll pay for it at the hospital but childcare in America is not cheap. $3000 a month for one child and $5000 a month for two children is a common price especially if you live in a higher col city like San jose or New York but it‚Äôs not too far off even in lower col cities. 

I know India loves to mimic America as america is great for innovation but it has also become so money minded that it makes a lot of Americans stressed about their finances.

These tiny black seeds, which come from the holy basil plant, have been used in Ayurveda for centuries - and modern science is now confirming their incredible benefits.

https://preview.redd.it/v8ub4a2bxzye1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65b1d1fd7fd8585897edc343e56797f6c2254d02

**Everyone‚Äôs raving about chia seeds and flaxseeds‚Äîbut there‚Äôs an ancient powerhouse we‚Äôre overlooking.** Our parents and grandparents knew it as Sabja , a humble seed tucked away in Ayurvedic remedies for centuries. Today, modern science is finally catching up, proving what Ayurveda always claimed: **Tulsi seeds are a superfood in their own league.**

As someone who's incorporated these seeds into my daily routine, I can personally vouch for their effects. Let me share everything I've learned about why you should consider adding them to your diet.



**5 Science-Backed Reasons to Eat Sabja Seeds Daily**

**1. They're nutritional powerhouses**

* Just 1 tablespoon provides:
* 40% of your daily fiber needs
* Plant-based omega-3s (great for vegetarians)
* Iron, calcium, and magnesium

**2.  They work like nature's appetite suppressant**

The seeds expand to 10x their size when soaked, creating a gel-like substance that keeps you full for hours. I've found them particularly helpful for controlling my afternoon snack cravings.

**3**.**They're a diabetic's best friend**

Studies show they can lower blood sugar spikes after meals by up to 30%. My aunt, who has type 2 diabetes, swears by her morning Sabja seed drink.

**4. Cooling Power for hots days & Workouts**

* **High mucilage content¬†:** Absorbs¬†10x its weight in water, forming a gel that slowly releases hydration. 
* **Eugenol (essential oil)¬†:** A natural coolant that¬†lowers body temperature. 
* **Magnesium & Potassium¬†:‚Äì**Electrolytes that¬†prevent dehydration and heat exhaustion.

**5. Glowing skin from within & outside**

* **Antioxidants (Flavonoids & Phenols)¬†:**Fight free radicals that cause dullness. 
* **Anti-inflammatory:**  Reduces acne and redness. 
* **Natural Detoxifier:** Flushes toxins linked to breakouts. 
* **Hyaluronic Acid-like Effect¬†:** The gel hydrates skin cells for a plump, dewy look.



**5 Easy Ways I Use Tulsi Seeds** 

**1. Morning Detox Drink**  My go-to recipe:- 

* 1 tsp soaked seeds
* 1 glass warm water
* Juice of 1/2 lemon- Pinch of turmeric

**2. Post-Workout Recovery Pudding**  Blend:-

*  2 tbsp soaked seeds
* 1 banana 
* 1 cup almond milk
* 1 scoop protein powder

**3.Gut-Healing Yogurt Bowl** Mix soaked seeds with:- 

* Greek yogurt
* Chopped nuts
* Drizzle of honey

**4. Cooling Summer Slushie**  Blend seeds with:- 

* Coconut water
* Frozen berries
* Mint leaves

**5.Skin-Boosting Face Mask**

Mix powdered seeds with:

* Aloe vera gel
* 1 tsp honey  (Leave on for 15 minutes)



**Important Safety Tips  From My Experience**

   **Always remember to:**

1. Soak for at least 15 minutes (I learned this the hard way when I once added dry seeds to a smoothie - not pleasant!)
2. Start with 1/2 tsp daily to assess tolerance
3. Drink plenty of water throughout the day

**Avoid if:**

* You're pregnant (they may affect hormones)
* You have low blood pressure
*  You're scheduled for surgery (they can thin blood)



**Are They Worth Trying?**

   After 3 months of regular use, I've noticed:

* Better digestion
* Fewer sugar cravings
* Glowing skin
* More stable energy levels

The best part? They're incredibly affordable - a 100g pack costs less than a cup of coffee and lasts months!

**Pro Tip:** Look for organic, non-GMO seeds from reputable Ayurvedic brands. I made the mistake of buying cheap seeds once and the quality was noticeably poorer.

So uhhh never thought I'd be in this situation. Don't want to get into too long about this, and maybe mostly want to vent a bit of a sanity check?

My gf and I have been having a really tough time lately, toughest in our two years together for various reasons. We were doing really good, but there's this new issue that has just caused a huge wedge between us. There's kind of this friend group with us three, and my gf's best friend. We all hang out regularly, and occasionally we'll branch off into twos or threes if it makes the most sense.

Awhile ago, I was having some issues with my best friend recently, and that was when I noticed my gf was refusing to take my side on it which was rather odd and just got kind of quiet whenever I talked about it. I also noticed she kept getting texts from my best friend like asking how she's feeling and her responding to him he'll text her back later... you know kind of odd. It kind of came to a head when she was wanting to get lunch or coffee with him again which she's been doing most days of the week lately and I told her it made me uncomfortable.

I talked to my best friend and patched things up so that we could move on from our dumb beef and all start hanging out as a group... but that didn't happen. There was more texting last week, and everytime I bring up that I don't like it because he's my confidant she says I can't control who her friends are. I just don't know why it has to be my best friend??  I don't like my girlfriend venting to my best friend and them just having more of a relationship it feels like than I do to either of them??

It doesn't help that whenever it is us hanging out I feel like they talk and vibed more together than anyone I've seen. At first I loved that because I thought it meant we could always have a great time together, but now those memories are stressing me out. I don't think they're cheating, I do think they're just becoming really close friends. I just really wish it wasn't with my best friend, is that wrong of me to feel that way? I get that they get along, they are my best friend and girlfriend so obviously they have a similar personality that I love, it doesn't surprise me.

Anyways, we almost broke up this weekend because I was really upset about a good morning text she got from him. It creeped me out honestly. Then she texted later in the car how she'll just have to text him later, and yeah we fought about it and it ruined our date. I do think I'm the jealous type and she just basically thinks we have different values and might not be compatible. I hated her male best friend before who was a huge asshole to me when I met him so it is coming off of that. The resolution ended up being I had to drop it and promise to change because I don't want to lose her.

But today again they are getting lunch together with no invitation extended to me. I'm stressed out?? Any advice?? I just wish they'd respect me enough after even that kind of fight to chill for even a single day even if it is just friend stuff. I really don't think there is any actual physical cheating as they aren't each others looks types, and my friend doesn't want to date anyways. But emotionally...

I'm 23, didn't have a job lined up, went to a small school in the Back Bay of Bosotn, Job market and job search has been killing me and I really don't want a sales job. I graduated last may. 

My degree is just in Management...I know just management and I don't know what do with my life. My parents are telling me to get my Masters but how will I know my ROI or if the job market wont f me? 

The MS in Business Analytics degree interests me because 1.Most nomad jobs are that and I want to work remotely, 2. I like creating things and that interests me a lot, im learning sql online but haven't made any projects.....  
I really need help, here are my questions 

1. How did the MS in Business Analytics at NEU prepare you for a job, was it meaningful or very broad learning? 

2. Is this degree saturated now? how difficult has it been in landing full time roles? 

3. Are the co-ops meaningful? does it have any relation to the education learned? 

Lastly, would you recommend the program and especially recommend it during this volatile job market? 



I really do feel like a bum, not jump starting my career or having a skill. Any help really does mean a lot!

TL;DR: 30s male, been in a dark place for 18 months. Tried everything - therapy, church, fitness, journaling, meditation, eating clean, quitting alcohol, walking 2k+ miles, launching businesses. Still numb, still fapping 5x a day to stuff I don‚Äôt even want. Not looking for a sermon, just some real guidance from people who‚Äôve been here.

i just found this community the other night and honestly it made me feel something i haven‚Äôt felt in a while, hope. just reading all of your stories, all different age groups, people coming to the same realization‚Ä¶ it hit me hard.

i haven‚Äôt wanted to admit this. not even to myself. but nofap - that‚Äôs the thing i‚Äôve been running from. it‚Äôs been my drug. my comfort. the thing that‚Äôs always there when nothing else is.

i‚Äôve been in a really dark place for the last 18 months. honestly the darkest i‚Äôve ever known. and i know there‚Äôs other subs for that, so i won‚Äôt go deep into it, but i‚Äôm guessing some of you know what i mean. the call of the void. the numbness. the kind of thoughts you don‚Äôt even want to say out loud.

sometimes it‚Äôs like the only way i get through the day is fapping. not once. like five times. and to stuff that doesn‚Äôt even make sense. like i‚Äôm a straight guy in my 30s and half the stuff i watch doesn‚Äôt line up with what i‚Äôd actually want in real life. it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ compulsive. desperate. automatic.

as far as the shame and embarrassment - i did read No More Mr. Nice Guy, and it helped me start unpacking some of the stuff i did when i was younger, even things in my last relationship. she weaponized a few of my kinks, used them against me, twisted them. and that book kind of helped me realize that sexuality‚Äôs a spectrum, and not everything has to be this guilt-ridden secret. so i‚Äôve worked through a lot of the shame, i guess, but even then, there‚Äôs this lingering feeling like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point. i don‚Äôt even want to travel. i don‚Äôt want to meet people. i‚Äôve got my drug right here. and the other drugs are coffee, sleep, scrolling tiktoks until my brain‚Äôs mush.

i know i‚Äôm not a lost cause. i‚Äôm decently attractive, people say. but i just don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. i don‚Äôt drink. don‚Äôt really go out. and i don‚Äôt want to make this a pity party, so here‚Äôs what i‚Äôve already done:
	‚Ä¢	therapy, years of it
	‚Ä¢	journaling (17 journals front to back)
	‚Ä¢	walked over 2,000 miles
	‚Ä¢	got in great shape, added 20 pounds of muscle
	‚Ä¢	dialed in my diet, tracked macros, animal-based stuff
	‚Ä¢	church, deliverance prayer, inner healing
	‚Ä¢	meditation
	‚Ä¢	cut out alcohol, barely socialize
	‚Ä¢	tried launching multiple businesses, all flopped

i‚Äôve done all the things they say are supposed to fix you. and i‚Äôm still here. still tired. still wired. still fapping. so i don‚Äôt even know anymore - if the fap is the cause or the symptom or both.

anyone been here? like really here? what helped you move forward?

thanks in advance.

- **Time Travelers** -
  Popularized by Michael Masters, who posits something a long the lines of UFOs and aliens being humans from the future.

 - **Breakaway civilization** -
  From the ancient Egyptians and Atlantis, to flat earth Nazi space aliens, these theories cover a lot of archeological and oddly political ground. A human civilization won via technological supremacy then fucked off to space. What they did there is up for debate, presumably they did a shadow government on us though.

- **They were here first** -
  Not sure who posited this one, but it implies another, pre-sapien species advanced beyond us, and did a similar thing to the breakaway civilization discussed above. Lizzid people territory.

But first let us go back not to the beginning but when the first appearance had occurred that night. For as any morning would go not very much was going on around him, getting ready but noticing that the mornings sunlight was much more brighter. 

Brighter than usual! Making sure to get his usual cup of iced coffee before setting off for the day. With day going by just as any other day, until! Later that night just around closing as he was just about to approach the end of an aisle.

She then appeared! Walking around the corner pushing a buggy almost running into each other startling her. With Dakota‚Äô not thinking too much about it at first, but when he got home realizing who the girl was. 

It was a girl in which he had written a binding contract on! But more on that later, for now let us continue. For as Dakota‚Äô set there that night thinking back, back to when he wrote the first one. 

Remembering that he had always had a fear of a certain movie his whole life not really realizing how much. Until he went and saw a remake of the movie some year‚Äôs ago, knowing that something inside of him was urging him to do something. 

And something he did! Writing what would be the first one of many that would come. But with everything in him wanting to write it on the girl from the movie. He did not! Leaving him to question himself from that day on, on why he didn‚Äôt! But instead he wrote the first one on someone else! A person a girl who was also very much coming onto the screen at the time. 

But with that one could ask the question of Dreams! What is a dream? Why do we have them? For a lot a the dreams that we have are soon forgotten. Some stay with us, while some are never forgotten, but for Dakota‚Äô Dreams he was about to endure like no one before. 

Not really remember the circumstances as to what took place prior to his dream on that night. Only remembering the after, setting there in a car some 35 years ago. 

After having a sleepover at a friend‚Äôs house, a friend who Dakota‚Äô had grew up with earlier in his life. It was a quit little town not really hidden away, but if you blink you would certainly miss it. But at the time he could remember telling him all about the dream the next morning. 

Just as they were to head to the local comic shop he remembered telling him about it. For the dream itself didn‚Äôt even seem like a dream, but more like I was looking at a still image. A picture! A picture of a blonde haired girl standing there holding a skateboard. 

For one thing about pictures is that they can tell a story, a story of one‚Äôs past, or in a way something that was to come.

In The Days To Come!

A picture that would come to haunt Dakota‚Äô in the years that would follow! For as the years would go by he would all but forget about having the dream until one night when he was living on his own. 

When another dream would occur, But this dream would be much more darker! With a much more realistic feel to it! As Dakota‚Äô slept not knowing what was about to happen. 

For as he slept a noise he would hear, but not like any regular noise of the night, but a noise that was like a deep crackling noise. With a dark tension feel to it.

But as the dream started to deepen he was in the hallway but he was inside of something or someone. That was walking down the hallway towards his room, but just as quickly he was back in his room. 

Still in a deep dream feel, just as he felt a strong static feeling suddenly come over him! Followed by an eeriness of others being there with him. Just as a blonde haired woman started to rise up out of the flames. 

Screaming in pain! As she was holding a piece of paper up as she then started pointing to it screaming 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Do It!‚Äù

But just as quickly as the woman appeared she was gone, as faces then slowly appeared from out of the darkness. Slowly one by one! Faces that only revealed very little of their appearance, but just enough to show more later on.

As it was followed by one last image, not just an image! But an image of a girl all dressed in white with numbers above her head. Number that in the days to come Dakota‚Äô would realize what they meant. 

But as the dream grew even deeper with more of a hold, Dakota‚Äô suddenly heard a loud crashing noise! Hearing two individuals coming quickly into his room. 

Just as one of them grabbed him wrapping his arms around Dakota‚Äô sticking his tongue out onto Dakota‚Äôs cheek several times. 

Just as Dakota‚Äô heard him saying 

‚ÄúHe was one of us!‚Äù ‚ÄúI will tear the flesh from his body!‚Äù

Just as the other said

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt dead yet! But he said that we can have him to do as we please‚Äù

But just before they both would leave Dakota‚Äô heard one last thing as one of them saying 

‚ÄúHe will become a girl!‚Äù Then I will rip her flesh from her body!‚Äù

For as the years went by nothing else really happened until he had went and saw the movie. And with it starting the events that would soon follow. 

For that night going to sleep Dakota‚Äô had no idea what he would wake up to, but awaken he was. Seeing a dark pale like face reaching for his face. Just as he felt something being ripped through his nose as it sent him crashing into the floor. 

But surprisingly there was no fear in him getting up from the floor soon going back to sleep. Unknowing of what he would encounter the next day at work. And encounter something he did! For just as he had given a quick glance over from him. 

An individual seemed to just appear from out of nowhere and for just a split second with what seemed to be a light.  A white light protruding from his eyes! And that was when he turned to see her! A woman walking towards him having a walk that just didn‚Äôt seem normal, as she walked towards him. 

With a grin looking to him as she passed by him letting him know without even saying a single word that they had finally got him. Both with a darkened skin color. Looking like they both belong to an earlier decade. 

Just as the male walked up to Dakota‚Äô grabbing his hand just before he slid his finger across the palm of his hand. It would be later in a dream that his name would be revealed to being

‚ÄúMcCoy!‚Äù 

But as quickly as they had come they would go leaving Dakota‚Äô there to wonder! To wonder what had just took place. But as the days passed, a dream would occur! A dream showing 
McCoy‚Äô coming towards him in his demon form having a long like snout bore like. 

But just before he had reached Dakota‚Äô then shouted out for forgiveness! Just as another individual suddenly appeared! Grabbing hold of him before taking him away. 

Leaving them pissed off even more now! With that beginning the onset of dreams that was to come. For over the years that would follow. A dream would occur on different nights showing different girls in each one. But with them knowing that would not be enough alone. 

And bringing with it Dakota‚Äô was then introduced very much into the Frey! Along with it a little contest that would occur! A little writing contest! For they knew if they were to ensnare him again they would have to go all the way. All the way to Hollywood! 

Giving a little bit here! Showing a little bit there! Knowing that in order to keep him that they would have to entice a little more. Just to keep Dakota‚Äô from being able to stop! 

For one night as Dakota‚Äô slept he was suddenly awaken to see something scrolling through his phone. Scrolling through a binding contract that he had written for as Dakota‚Äô had opened his eyes the scrolling suddenly come to stop. Feeling a smack from a hand on his eye leaving him to be for now. 

But along with the dreams also came warnings with some of the dreams, for one night after Dakota‚Äô had written one. A dream he had with him awakening up in a darkened area with him being the girl that he had written on. Looking around seeing individuals setting there looking at him. 

With all of them wearing a brown cut off sack cloth covering only there mid section, with them wearing a band around their arms. Most if not all of them with long hair giving them a native look about them. Just one started to pat Dakota‚Äô on his head before saying 

‚ÄúSo you want to be down here with us do you‚Äù

With the dream coming to end after that leaving many more to follow, along with hearing them often speak. Talking amongst each other as Dakota‚Äô would sleep. For instance he heard on different nights with them saying thing like 

‚ÄúMcCoy is no longer over this‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have been ordered to give him what he wants! That is if he holds out long enough!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh the poor thing so badly wanted to be that one!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNoah didn‚Äôt have an Immortal on the ark with him‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe will let him walk around during the dark ages being her‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause he doesn‚Äôt wish no harm upon others he can live normally being her‚Äù

‚ÄúThen show us another one where he wrote a normal life‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear I can‚Äôt wait to when that day starts so he will become her! Then ours!‚Äù

That was just a few things that Dakota‚Äô had over heard them saying amongst themselves, for in the days to come! One by one they would come! Not all of the girls would come but mainly being the ones that were showed in the second dream. 

But one thing that has been around for sometime nor leaving some to wonder, can one bend reality? For bending reality is to will something to occur for something to happen that only a few would even know of it ever happening. 

Leaving Dakota where he was now setting there not knowing leaving him to think would he ever know. Or would he end up 

Never knowing

That I just ‚Äúdo whatever I want‚Äù and am a bitch and no one likes me. That im a terrible person and mother and everyone knows it. He said he saw my ‚Äúcousins laugh at me because they know how terrible I am to live with‚Äù. He admitted he lied and that my cousins never laughed at all. 
This most recent fight where he berated me and yelled at me while I‚Äôm feeding our exclusively breastfed daughter was because I allegedly ‚Äúdemanded he make decaf coffee last night because we were out‚Äù. I did not demand anything at all, I said ‚Äú we are out of decaf‚Äù 
In my sleep deprived state it may have sounded like a demand, but I did offer to make it after he gave me a look. In any case I don‚Äôt think that warrants the spit fire I received. 

Now he‚Äôs on a bender. Again. He made it approx one week without drinking. 
To top it off I have mastitis and feel like I have the worst flu of my life. And baby is now screaming. I just need a shower. 

If doing whatever I want I tending to every hiccup cry and diaper my newborn makes then I guess that‚Äôs all I do??!!?! 
My baby is thriving because of me, 

Last time he showed up wasted at 4 am with no keys trying to get back in. He had blocked my number and left me alone with a two week old newborn for almost 24 hours. I texted his friend to make sure he was alive and to convey the message that he needed to sleep somewhere else. But he still tried to come home. 
He said I was using baby as a shield. 
He proceeded to slam the huzzer incessantly, for *hours* waking our newborn up. 

Aitah.

How do I protect my baby from ever seeing him again. Or am I the ah. 


EDIT: for full side. I might be the asshole. 
He tried to apologize saying he didn‚Äôt want to fight and my cousins never laughed at me (I know this but that hurt. He made me cry) 
He admitted to being an ass. Said ‚Äúyour sick you need help with the baby‚Äù and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being an ass too even if you can‚Äôt admit it‚Äù
He missed baby‚Äôs Dr appointment (I told him to leave because in the way there he‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm horrible a bad mother etc. and said he was really upset to miss it. 
And then ‚Äúsay you want to keep trying‚Äù

I then did return with my own insults. I don‚Äôt even read his apology until after i send paragraphs of text explaining why I was so upset. I was just so pissed. I told him this was his fault. That he‚Äôs an idiot for leaving us alone because I said we were out of decaf. That he‚Äôs abusive and selfish and pathetic. I said I did nothing wrong and he owed me an apology. And then I apologized for what he accused me of (but didn‚Äôt exactly do) and apologized for calling him names. Then I took it back. I said get in touch within the hour because I‚Äôm not waiting for you to come to your senses. ",27,1746464830.0,AITAH,62,0.8,False

It's super compact, doesn‚Äôt need pods (though it can use them), and it actually makes legit espresso with crema.

What would it be to be able to record the dreams that one has, and see them later? That's what Dr. Bellermann once thought. He was obsessed with the world of dreams, he wanted to discover a deeper meaning about them, but he was not able to remember them. Shortly after awakening, he almost completely forgot what he had seen, heard, and sometimes felt.

The scientist conceived the creation of a machine capable of analyzing the mind, decoding dreams and displaying them on a monitor, to later be recorded on film tapes. Cables that ended in pads were connected to the skull of the sleeper, the information was transmitted to the machine and the output was displayed on the monitor, in color and with built-in sound. Here I will let him tell it himself.

**The Story of Rudolph Bellermann.**

From a very young age, I was drawn to ideas of the eternal, the source of infinite progress, the enhancement of human capabilities, becoming¬†*more*¬†than human. Curiosity was always present in me, but it was accompanied by the frustration of not finding what I wanted quickly. It was a somewhat stormy relationship with my work.

The world of dreams has always caused me great interest, for me they are not simple films of the human mind, nor hallucinations. I want to know if they have a deep, unknown meaning. The problem is the forgetfulness of so many and so diverse worlds that I have visited, not being able but to vaguely perceive the greatness of those.

I have created this machine, and I have dared to test it on a dog. My humanity was not prepared to contemplate the prodigy of my invention. Indeed, animals dream, and the appearance was very adept at reality, although at times the image became more abstract in appearance. Sometimes there was no image but only sounds. I was not surprised by the dream of the dog, but the beauty of the colors and shapes did surprise me, and even more so, knowing that animals have many dreams and fantasies.

I have tried to use the invention on myself, but emotion has robbed me of my ability to sleep. I have been active for two days now, and decided to use it on my loving neighbor, Frederick. He is a man for whom I have great affection, with his body made a mess, his mind nesting all sorts of terrors and fears that like a dirty sponge he has collected from so many bad experiences in his turbulent life as a merchant. And decrepit, even in his youth, his body worn down by a perpetual flow of refined sugar. I am fond of him, and I have set out to free him from his mediocre genetics. I love my good old pal.

Good old Fred was happy to be part of the experiment, I put the cables in his skull. At zero hours at night I managed to visualize his dreams, I was overwhelmed by the festival of colors and sounds of all kinds. It was like an enormous blackish liquid in which luminous creatures of insignificant size swam. The sounds were similar to those of whales, but lower and deeper. The presence of a vigilant being was felt in the surroundings, even if it was a simple video!

The experience with Frederick excited me. I spent another 2 days without being able to sleep, until my body could produce enough melatonin; I resisted coffee for a long time. I took advantage of placing the cables, and ordered the device to record any broadcast of dreams. When I woke up, it was four in the morning.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing: they were my dreams; I knew they were amazing. It was me, rising to Outer Space, and then running fast, passing through galaxies very quickly. What surprised me was to see with the space simulator that each and every sidereal body was in its exact place.

I spent a few weeks recording my own dreams, one of the ones I liked the most was seeing that strange garden full of exuberance and creatures that I cannot describe with enough clarity. In it, a being without a body pierces my soul, and I have felt a happiness that, even as a man, has caused me to cry as a small child. That has been the happiest feeling of my existence until today, and I have only had it once.

**The cinematheque of dreams.**

I decided to archive my dreams and those of other humans, even animals. I divide them by name, date, type, duration. I have opened a Cinema, I charge for the entrance. The function varies according to the occasion, including nightmares on witches' days, Christmas dreams, and many others of adventure, abstract and even romance. With these charged functions I get money to finance my experiments.

**The unknown entity - overcoming fear.**

It happens that a ghostly vision, really worrying because of how deformed and haggard it looks, appears in some of my dreams, even the most beautiful ones. It is perhaps the ""dark part"" of my thinking. My friend Dr. Heinz, is a very experienced psychologist in a school that he himself founded, based on the ""vitality"" of the individual, something very close to the philosophy of myself, though I still prefer tranquility in life.

He warned me that that cadaverous being, with dry hair and devoid of muscles, represents my fears of defeat, failure and, in turn, a negative vision of death. Heinz assured that I should destroy that Death in my dreams, in order to have peace.

Lucid dreaming was something very new to my understanding, being able to control my own dreams filled me with intrigue, it was very attractive. Over time I managed to have that dream, I went to Death, who was pointing at me with his bony hand. I said: ""disappear"", and it did so instantly. Seeing that on video was inspiring, everyone who saw it was filled with great strength, seeing my worst enemy defeated. They were very interested in lucid dreaming, patience, it takes practice!

And so my story ends. I thank all those people who have supported me, Florinda's sweet voice, which fills me with vigor, makes me believe in life, and Frederick's naive and courageous charm. That bag of diseases; I love him like a son, I'll take care of him completely right now.

Goodbye friends, and be happy.

**The beginning of a new story.**

Dr. Rudolph Bellermann practiced lucid dreaming for a time, making his own films and recording them, deciding what to dream and how. Frederick improved in health and got interest in real estate business.



Over time Mr. Bellermann lost interest in dreams, got bored with his invention and gave it to some teenagers at the University. These in turn gave him a ‚Äúholographic video game console‚Äù. It consisted of a dashboard with controls; when turned on, the board emitted a glow in which a holographic image was drawn, visible from all angles. Up to four players could play at the same time.

There was tennis, boxing and a very interesting one about a castle in which a lady is lost, and is stalked by a monster. Dr. Bellermann was fascinated with the apparatus and designed his own games, and invited others to do the same. Something youthful, and we are talking about a 74-year-old man. Luckily he has genes for eternal youth!",1,1746464335.0,u_Impressive_Sail_6957,0,1.0,False

My family won him from a faire(ughhh üôÑ). Unfortunately my uncle, doesn‚Äôt care about fish at all. When I returned home on the day he won him, I saw the lil tiny guy in a dingy old COFFEE POT his water was full of debris and he used DISTILLED WATER. So, furiously and in a panic, I saved him. Bought him conditioner and temporarily put him in a typical goldfish bowl just until I could go out to buy him a proper tank and filtration system.

My little sister named him Mr. Coffee! Due to his‚Ä¶ experience when he was brought home. Eventually the lore expanded and now he is to be addressed as ‚ÄúMr. Dr. Coffee‚Äù as he runs a coffee shop and has his PHD in marine Biology! He is a distinguished fellow. üßê

I am taking full care of him, as my uncle would have killed him within days and basically dumped this fish on me.  I even printed him 10 pages on comet goldfish care(he never read a word of it) and BEGGED him not to get any ‚Äúfriends‚Äù for him. He wanted to stick a poor koi in there.. üò≠He is my son now and I love him so so much. I am dedicated to providing him with the most full-filling fish life possible. He‚Äôs 7 months old at this time and i am shocked he had made it this far. I am really trying my best for him.

He‚Äôs about 3 1/5 inches long now, living in a 36 gallon bowfront aquarium, with a nice filter(i have it on high because i read that they like a current and for oxygen)

His tank is boring. Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt added anything for him to have fun with. I want to add some Java fern but I‚Äôm very scared of messing something up and something happening to him by my fault. I was thinking about adding a few moss balls maybe.

I know bettas love those leaves for the tannins but I don‚Äôt know how comet goldfish feel about that. He is on this ugly basic teal fish gravel. I‚Äôd love to use something more natural looking.

I feel like he is super bored in there, I think he tries to swim with his reflection at times but he doesn‚Äôt attack it, I feel horrible about it. I‚Äôm terrified of adding a ‚Äúhide/tunnel thing‚Äù because of potential fin tears or it tipping over. üò±

I would love to make his tank a bit Coffee Shop Themed with his health and comfort remaining top priority. A family member suggested just putting a ceramic coffee cup in there but that doesn‚Äôt feel very safe to me(maybe if it is smooth/well rounded/ and mostly buried in the substrate?) I‚Äôm planning on printing out a dark brown and simple coffee shop background for the back of the tank, enough for us to tell what it is but not disturb Mr. Coffee‚Äôs peace.

He has no tank mates because I‚Äôm praying he has enough room to grow fully and healthily without being stunted and live his best life. I‚Äôm looking into breeding brine shrimps for endless food supply for him (currently feeding him basic fish flakes only)

Any wisdom on how I can do better for my lil guy and how I can make his home aesthetically pleasing and fitting for his name are greatly appreciated, thank you!",1,1746464281.0,Aquariums,0,1.0,False

Bear with me, English is not my first language and I am so over everything.  
 I am a first year of a 3-5 year public college for design. I cannot pause the year nor drop out since it costs too much; literally only going outside to hang out with my friends and hope things get better. 

For context, I've been an art person since I was born, drawing cringe fanart before the age of 7. I've graduated from a good art high school, my teacher and mentor told me to not quit drawing comics cause he sees I'm good at it and it's my passion. Thank the universe for his wise words otherwise I would've quit long ago probably. Drawing in class went from being my favorite part of the day to a chore. The main problem happened after graduation. 

I took a pause from education for a year to take care of my mental health and get a job (both failed), plus to get ready for college, find an apartment, etc. I got in, somehow. I added finished artworks and stuff I was passionate about to my portfolio and, I kid you not, got 40 points out of possible 100 (excluding the optional bonus task.) That broke my spirit, I still think about that list to this day. It's really true that what you like is not what others will. But I could not show them unfinished projects.

Later, I met people who draw 150 times better than me and all my confidence went down the drain, again. Just as I was being okay with my skills and started drawing in my 4-year abandoned sketchbook. I stopped drawing as much for enjoyment, practice, *and* for college. Just holding a pen makes me want to bash my head against the wall. I'm falling behind in 3 subjects already. A professor I dislike likes the same things I do and it made me so mad. I can't enjoy mythology the same knowing he had also made similar things I wanted years prior. 

Also a quick side note, nothing is creatively unique anymore. Everything has been done so what's even the point? We will lose our jobs to AI, we will be forced to serve the rich like pigs to slaughter cause that's what being human is now, I guess. Art has been my only escape from it all... But what to do when art is not fun or satisfying anymore...? Without art I am nothing and no one. I barely passed with good grades all non-creative subjects. Got no other talents except sometimes decent art. I love art. I love it but as every relationship of mine, it's one sided. My parents were worried why art was the only thing that interested me and now I understand their fear. Wish I could find one simple thing to keep me going that's not overspending on food, coffee or alcohol.

I hope you have some advice that could make me learn to love being an artist again that is not as generic as my Google search history for the past month. I'm supposed to do 2 long ass projects for tomorrow morning (it's 7pm right now.)

I was firmly in that chaotic zone, running on caffeine and adrenaline, convinced that hustle was the badge of honor I needed. But guess what? It nearly broke me. If you can relate, lean in a bit because I‚Äôve got a ""lazy"" hack that might just reignite your drive without driving you to the edge.

So picture this: I was sprinting through a never-ending to-do list, celebrating wins like they were massive achievements (even if they were just crossing off ‚Äúmake coffee‚Äù). My brain was buzzing with all the things I *had* to do. And then, BOOM! Burnout hit like an unwelcome freight train. üöÇ

Ever felt like you were stuck in a never-ending cycle of achievement? Like every goal you hit just set off ten more? That was me! 

**Here‚Äôs the thing:** Sometimes doing *less* actually gives you *more*.

‚ú® **The ‚ÄúLazy‚Äù Hack** ‚ú® 

1. **Embrace the Art of *Not* Hustling**: 
   - What if I told you that doing less can boost your productivity? Yep! I started blocking off *do-nothing time* in my schedule, and it felt like a mini-vacay for my brain. üå¥

2. **Set Micro-Goals**: 
   - Goals are great, but they can feel overwhelming. I started breaking them down into tiny, bite-sized tasks. Instead of ‚Äúwrite a report,‚Äù I‚Äôd go for ‚Äúbrainstorm ideas for the report‚Äù one day, then ‚Äúwrite the first paragraph‚Äù the next. Progress though flow, not pressure!

3. **Prioritize Rest Like It's A Job**: 
   - Seriously, I treat my downtime like a meeting that I can‚Äôt skip. Who says rest is for the weak? It‚Äôs actually fuel for your drive! I even set a reminder for a daily relaxation break ‚Äì sounds fancy, right? 

4. **Ask *Why* Before You *Do***: 
   - Before diving into a task, I ask myself - ""Is this aligned with my true goals?‚Äù It‚Äôs a game-changer! If it‚Äôs not, I ditch it. Less fluff, more substance!

5. **Get *Lazy* with Intent**: 
   - I started indulging in absolute laziness by watching shows, reading books, or just staring at the ceiling (not even kidding). Turns out, allowing yourself to veg can spark those creative juices and bring back your emotional drive. Who would‚Äôve thought?

And the wildest thing? I found that by allowing myself to chill and not hustle 24/7, I actually became more *motivated*. Like, what‚Äôs up with that? ü§î

We‚Äôve all got that voice in our heads that pushes us to grind even when our bodies say ‚Äúno‚Äù. But maybe, just maybe, we can rewrite the script. What if our best selves come out when we prioritize balance?

Everyone has their own pace, and it‚Äôs totally cool if yours looks different from the person next to you. Maybe it‚Äôs time to redefine achievement ‚Äì not as a 24/7 grindfest, but as moving forward at a pace that fuels you without draining you. So, what are you thinking?

1kfgmu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kfgmu4/explore_if_the_primula_burke_cold_brew_coffee/,Explore if the Primula Burke Cold Brew Coffee Maker review meets expectations!,"The **Primula Burke Deluxe Cold Brew Iced Coffee Maker** has become one of my new favorite kitchen gadgets‚Äîand that‚Äôs coming from someone who drinks way too much coffee. I‚Äôve been testing it over the past few weeks, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an intriguing experience. Making cold brew at home was something I‚Äôd wanted to try, and this glass carafe made the process ridiculously simple. First impressions? It‚Äôs sleek, functional, and doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúappliance‚Äù on your kitchen counter‚Äîalways a bonus when you‚Äôre nearing critical gadget overload.

**Streamlined Design for Daily Iced Coffee Needs**

Right out of the box, one thing that stood out was how lightweight yet durable the design felt. The temperature-safe glass carafe paired with a BPA-free plastic cage gives it a polished yet practical look. I‚Äôm all about drinks that look as good as they taste, and this one delivers. The fact that it fits snugly into most refrigerator doors makes it perfect for my rather crowded fridge. Add to that a secure lid to keep the brew fresh for up to two weeks‚Äîit feels like it was designed for my very specific need for convenience and caffeine.

[Check Primula Primula price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0711wz7s7/)

**Usability and Brewing Process**

Getting started was ridiculously easy. All I had to do was add coarsely ground coffee (just a heads-up, using finely ground beans in the reusable mesh filter will not end well), pour in cold water, and let it brew in the fridge overnight. No complicated settings or buttons‚Äî just good old manual brewing. The removable fine mesh filter is probably my favorite feature here. It‚Äôs sturdy, easy to clean, and doesn‚Äôt let coffee grounds sneak into my drink. Bonus points for no unnecessary mess.

**Advantages**

- Easy manual setup, no confusing tech wizardry required.
- Durable glass carafe that‚Äôs temperature-safe and easy to handle.
- The mesh filter is reusable and a breeze to clean‚Äîfinally, no one-off paper filters!
- Compact build fits comfortably in my fridge while not hogging precious door space.

**Small Hiccups Along the Way**

While I‚Äôve become a dedicated fan of this product, everything isn‚Äôt entirely perfect (though what is?). One of the small gripes I had was with the brewing time. Cold brewing takes at least 12‚Äì24 hours, and while that‚Äôs typical for this type of coffee maker, impatience often got the better of me. Also, if you‚Äôre like me and tend to daydream while pouring water, you might end up over-spilling around the filter. The design can be a little splash-prone, so slow and steady wins the race here.

**Negatives**

- Cold brewing requires patience‚Äîit‚Äôs not ideal for last-minute coffee bursts.
- Pouring water into the filter can feel awkward; a more user-friendly spout would help.
- While durable, the glass makes me a little anxious about dropping it.

**Who‚Äôs This For?**

This is practically a dream tool for any iced coffee or cold brew fans. If you‚Äôre tired of overpriced coffee shop runs, this gadget is a solid investment. Not only does it give you control over the strength and flavor of your coffee, but you can also experiment with syrups, cream, or even making iced teas if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous. My co-worker, who always grabs those bottled cold brews from the gas station, gave this a try, too. Even with their limited experience, they were surprised at how smooth and delicious the coffee turned out.

**Market Rivals**

I did some comparing, especially with models like the Takeya Deluxe Cold Brew Coffee Maker. While Takeya has some great features‚Äînamely its indestructible plastic body for folks who drop things‚Äîits aesthetic just doesn‚Äôt come close to the sleek glass carafe of the Primula. The OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker, often praised for its flavor extraction, was another contender but felt overly bulky on my counter. If you value design and simplicity, the Burke strikes an excellent balance.

**True Value**

One thing I‚Äôve wrestled with is the cost-to-quality ratio. While there might be cheaper alternatives, they usually compromise on durability or efficiency. With this product, I found myself appreciating the robust construction and daily use. I felt like this coffee maker was made with care and attention to little details, which made every cent feel justified. Also, let‚Äôs not forget that making my cold brew saves me a surprising amount in coffee shop expenses.

1kfgkfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1kfgkfl/what_i_learned_from_faang_and_startup_coffee/,What I learned from FAANG and startup coffee chats: My data scientist interview prep guide,"After having 20+ coffee chat with data scientists and hiring managers from FAANG and thriving startups, I finally understood what interviewers are really looking for: not just technical correctness, but your ability to reason through ambiguity, communicate clearly, and tie your work to business outcomes. Top candidates don't just write clean SQL, they know why they're writing it, what stakeholders need to hear, and how to challenge flawed assumptions in the data.

**Types of Data Science Roles**  
The questions you‚Äôll face and the skills you need to highlight depend heavily on the specific flavor of data science role you‚Äôre targeting. Understand what kind of data scientist the company is hiring for.  
**Machine Learning-Focused**:  
Common job titles: Applied Scientist, ML Data Scientist, AI Researcher  
These roles expect you to design, tune, and sometimes productionize ML models. You'll see fewer business metric questions and more deep dives into algorithms, pipelines, and model evaluation.Interview focus: ML coding (e.g., implement model from scratch, tune hyperparameters) ML concepts (e.g,. pros/cons of XGBoost vs. logistic regression) Data preprocessing and feature engineering. Occasional deep learning or NLP if the team focuses on those areas  
**Product/Analytics-Focused**  
Common job titles: Data Scientist, Product Analyst, Business Data Scientist, Full Stack Data ScientistThese are closer to product manager or business analyst roles, focusing on generating insights, influencing decisions, and driving product growth through data.Interview focus: SQL and experimentation (e.g., A/B testing). Product sense and business metrics. Communication and stakeholder management. Less emphasis on advanced ML algorithms  
**Full-Stack Data Scientist**  
Common job titles: Full-Stack Data Scientist, Generalist DSThese roles require strong ML chops and a solid business and product strategy. You‚Äôre expected to own projects end-to-end, from defining metrics to deploying models and analyzing impact.Interview focus: ML coding + experimentation + product intuition. Strong statistics foundation. Communication across tech and business stakeholders.  
**Data Engineering-Focused**  
Common job titles: Data Scientist - Platform, Data Engineer, ML EngineerNot a traditional DS role, but some job titles overlap. These roles are more focused on infrastructure, pipelines, and tooling.Interview focus: Data modeling. Big data tools (Spark, Hive). Python, Scala, or Java. Less emphasis on modeling, more on scalability and reliability  
Tip: Read the job description closely. If it emphasizes A/B tests, SQL, and metrics‚Äîyour prep should lean analytical. If it calls for building pipelines and tuning models, go deeper on ML and systems.  
  
**Interview Process**  
While the exact process varies by company and role type, here‚Äôs a typical breakdown of what to expect:  
**Recruiter Screen** (30 minutes)  
This is a quick fit check. The recruiter will: Walk through the job scope. Ask about your background and salary expectations. Outline the interview process and timeline  
Prep Tip: Be clear about your role preferences (analytics, ML, etc.) and ask questions to clarify expectations early.  
**Technical Screen** (30‚Äì60 minutes)  
You‚Äôll face 2‚Äì4 short questions, usually around: SQL. Basic statistics or probability. Python fundamentals. Lightweight ML concepts  
*Prep Tip:* Treat this like a pass/fail filter. Practice clean, efficient code and explain your reasoning clearly.  
**Statistics & Experimentation** (60 minutes)  
One of the most common and heavily weighted rounds, especially for analytics and product-focused roles. You may be asked to: Design an A/B test from scratch. Walk through a hypothesis test. Discuss statistical assumptions and pitfalls. Calculate power or confidence intervals  
*Prep tip:* Practice structured thinking, clarify the problem, define metrics, state hypotheses, and reason through edge cases.  
**SQL** (60 minutes)  
This round tests your ability to manipulate data directly‚Äîoften from 1‚Äì2 tables with joins, filters, and aggregations.Expect to: Use `GROUP BY`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, `CASE`. Explain your query logic. Interpret or debug a provided query  
*Prep tip:* Write readable, well-indented queries and focus on both correctness and performance.  
**Machine Learning Coding** (60 minutes)  
You‚Äôll be asked to code up a small ML model and evaluate it, typically in Python. Think real-world scenarios like churn prediction, fraud detection, or personalization.  
*Prep tip:* Focus on structured pipelines: data prep ‚Üí model ‚Üí evaluation. Use libraries you‚Äôre most comfortable with (e.g. scikit-learn).  
**Machine Learning Concepts** (60 minutes)  
This round explores your understanding of key ML algorithms and trade-offs.Common questions: ‚ÄúHow does random forest work?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite algorithm and why?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow would you improve a model with high variance?‚Äù  
*Prep tip:* Use examples from past projects and explain trade-offs like a teacher, not a textbook.  
**Product Sense / Case Study** (45‚Äì60 minutes)  
Mostly for analytics-focused roles, this round mimics the product management interview. You‚Äôll be expected to:Define key product metrics. Suggest experiments or KPIs. Evaluate product impact from a dataset  
*Prep tip:* Practice structured responses using mini case studies (e.g. ""How would you measure the success of a new feature?"").  
**Behavioral Interview** (30‚Äì60 minutes)  
This round tests collaboration, leadership, and how you communicate technical work.Expect questions like: ‚ÄúTell me about a time you had to influence without authority‚Äù‚ÄúDescribe a project you led from start to finish‚Äù‚ÄúHow do you handle stakeholder pushback?‚Äù  
*Prep tip:* Use a consistent story format (e.g. STAR), but tailor stories to the company‚Äôs values and goals.  
**Take-Home Assignment** (2‚Äì5 hours)

You put yourself in the victim role and therefore put me in the role of perpetrator and I refuse it. I am blame free. I invite you only in my life on my terms, if you can be positive, friendly, respectful and kind. I do not want any chaos, drama and anger, from no one, including you.

1kfgfak,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfgfak,"Warehouses, an interesting find","After my sandbox economy stabilized, I started importing anything that I need (food mainly for variety) and stopped exports on most things aside rum, planks and leather, with occasional gold on 20%. Yes, the rest of the items on the list never left the ports.

There was no cotton imports at all, and most export requests were something that I never produced. Until I moved the Banana and Coffee into the warehouse. As you can see I have no more banas on the port  and a low amount of coffee (no farms just raids and import) and I got offers to export them slightly after.

So it's one actual strategy that if you move them out in an emergency mode from teamsters, you probably get a route for it after you no longer have much on the ports. This requires two extra shipments on it, but if it's close to the docks it's pretty easy to store then unstore and let it go to transport.

Generally you can stack up a bunch of wool and maybe cotton, coal and iron for the next era and start pumping out clothes and steel, cloths require no educated workers so it's way easier than others when you need doctors and high school workers for religion and other services (immigration, customs office, radios and theathres) The footprint is a bit too big for warehouses but you can mvoe them once they are filled to future processing locations.

Generally I have a separate Iron and Coal with 3x storage, you need at least 2 slots when processing, one to process, one to store, then swap before they go empty or full. You can mix a few that go to the same place, like Fish/Pineapple/meat and coffee(cold war) for cannery. Then Wool and Cotton for cloth. Rubber is also for cold war but you can get imports in the colonial.

The ammounts are best on 3-9k medium shipments so your contracts won't be occupied for too long, obviously you take the LEather/RUm/Planks on 20% out and you can consider -5-10% for smuggler routes for gold, shellfish. For exports you just take whatever you have and have enough to fill instantly on 10-20k.",3,1746463629.0,tropico,0,1.0,False
1kfgf6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1kfgf6z/i_am_losing_my_mind_because_of_my_mom/,I am losing my mind because of my mom,"TW: mentions of eating disorders, SH and suicidal ideation
AND THIS IS SO LONG SORRY

I am in a very very dark place mentally right now and have been for months. Life with my parents has always been hard but I now really don't know what to do anymore. My mom has other mental and physical issues as well so I'm aware this is an overlap of narcissism and everything else but I am really done, I wish I could go NC right this instant istg.

I am in my twenties and am currently studying and working, but It's a part time job and I don't make nearly enough to move out so I'm still living with my parents even though I would LOVE to leave right this instant.

I'm not going to talk about my father because even though he is just as much as a narcissist he is also just a garbage human being who has always been openly treating us like shit and I despise him so much for making me and mom miserable (which 100% contributed to make my mom the way she is) that I just grey rock him and mostly ignore everything he says.

Now the real issue is my mom, because while I can just deal with my dad by reminding myself how shit he is I love my mom very very dearly and I cannot help but care and worry about her all day every day and I just can't help getting hurt by the things she says and does.

My mom has emotionally neglected me ever since I can remember- never gave a damn about my feelings, got mad and told me to stop whining whenever I would cry when I was little, denied getting me therapy when I openly asked as a teen, stood silent while I went through YEARS of a very visible eating disorder, later ignored the fact I came home with giant bruises all over my body whenever I saw my ex. I once had a complete breakdown and started banging my head on the kitchen table (the only time I have ever openly displayed this kind of behaviour): she came into the kitchen, ignored me, started making coffee with the coffee machine ON THAT TABLE with me keeling on the floor hitting my head on the edge; I was so desperate I admitted to hear that I hurt myself daily and all she managed to say was ""good for you"". I was around 15 at that time I believe.
I have always tried to defend her from my father's verbal abuse telling him that he was wrong and that he needed to respect my mother- she rarely ever sided with me. All my life she has been talking badly about him to me behind his back, she has always talked about leaving him but never did, she has been threatening to kill herself several times since I was like 8/9 (I barely remember anything about my life before that age so idk).
On the other side- she is the only parent who ever showed she loved me. She is the only one who got me presents for my birthdays and Christmas, and she would always put so much thought into those presents like little notes and things like that. I do think that she loves me and I do love her with every fiber of my being despite everything.

She got very sick about a year ago and I feel so disgusting by saying this but home life has become literal hell ever since.
The first months were hospital stays where me and my dad would go visit and I had to deal with my dad at home on my own while trying to do as much as I could for my mom always- I thought that was bad already but oh boy. 
Ever since she came home things are so much worse.
For context, both my parents have always worked from home so I never ever have a second to myself. My room doesn't have a door (my parents bedroom is right beside mine, as in, I have to walk through it to go downstairs) and even though I have a driving license my dad won't let me take the car (we only have one) so the only way I have of leaving the house is asking one of them to take me to the train station or walking 50 minutes to the bus stop (I live in a small town on a hill).
My mom has been complaining about. Everything. All day every single day I wake with her yelling- at my dad, at the dog, at the fucking SUN. She spendd most of her day in bed (next to my room) loudly lamenting about every single thing and everyone mostly me and my dad for EVERYTHING. She is spitting out these spiteful passive aggressive remarks and self victimizing all day I swear to God there is not one single moment I don't hear her talking. AND I CANT IGNORE IT- I CAN'T put on headphones and ignore because I HAVE to hear her I HAVE to know everything that is going on in my house at all times I just have to.
I go ask if she needs something and get a smirky remark. Or yelled at. I do the dishes I get yelled at. I don't do them same thing. I stay in my room making no noise at all all day except when I muster the courage to go downstairs to do the chores. I pretend I don't exist.
I start shaking everytime I have to go downstairs, I am TERRIFIED because I never ever know what I'm gonna get, to the point where I skip meals and don't go to the bathroom until I hear everyone is asleep or in the garden. I try to eat with them as much as I can because I feel bad for my mom if I leave her to eat alone with him but every single meal I am on my chair curled up in a ball and literally shaking with anxiety.

Trying to avoid all contact I can with the both of them atm because I literally am afraid to walk inside of my own home and whenever I get a spiteful comment by my mom I go to my room and start hitting myself in the head or drinking (I try to keep alcohol in my room at all times to deal and it's getting out of hand) because the way I'm wired I immediately go to the thought that this is all my fault and I need punishment. I never ever express any feeling in front of them ever be it positive or negative. I started SHing again. I am miserable.

I can't sleep because the roof in my room has been leaking for 15+ years and it's rainy season here. I stay awake and I go check on my mom in her room every hour to see if she is still breathing because she keeps yelling and threatening she will kill herself and I am TERRIFIED of losing her. My dad is actually spending a lot of time with her even though she HATES it and keeps saying she wants him to gtfo of her face but he is actually making am effort and he became way less shitty to her (even though I can never forgive him for everything else).

I had a shit ton of hobbies mostly making music but I haven't dared playing anything in months because I am afraid that if she hears me doing something I enjoy she will use it against me or get mad and make me hate it.

There's something truly magical about enjoying a hot cup of coffee surrounded by nature that enhances the entire experience.  
  
My journey through outdoor brewing has included several approaches:  
  
Aeropress: Incredibly compact and cleanup is minimal, though it does require heated water and a relatively flat surface to operate properly.  
  
French press (travel version): Delivers excellent flavor but cleaning grounds from the mesh filter can be challenging when water resources are limited.  
  
Moka pot: Produces a robust, almost espresso-like coffee, but it's on the heavier side and demands a reliable heat source, which isn't always practical when traveling ultralight.  
  
I recently tested the OutIn Nano with its built-in heating element and I've been quite impressed by its performance. The self-contained nature eliminates the need for separate heating equipment.

1kfgbdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kfgbdt/uncover_the_gaggia_velasca_espresso_machine/,Uncover the Gaggia Velasca Espresso Machine review for coffee lovers!,"The Gaggia RI8260/47 Velasca Espresso Machine has been part of my daily coffee routine for a couple of weeks now. Coming from someone who needs that perfect cup of espresso to kickstart the day, I can say this machine carries both charm and functionality, though not without certain nuances to take into account. Here‚Äôs how it has fared under my review.

**Stylish and Compact Design**  
The sleek black design and compact build of this espresso machine make it an aesthetic addition to any kitchen counter. With a height of under 14 inches, it slides comfortably under most cabinets, saving space in a crowded kitchen. I love that the water reservoir and bean hopper are front-loaded because you don‚Äôt have to pull the machine forward every time you need a refill. However, I noticed that the lightweight construction makes it slightly shaky when operating, especially during grinding.

**Programmable Brewing and Customization Options**  
As a coffee enthusiast, I found the programmable brewing options particularly delightful. You can tweak beverage volume, temperature, and strength to fit your preferred taste profile. The machine offers three temperature settings and five brew strength levels, which gave me plenty of room to experiment with my morning cup. Additionally, it allows for the use of pre-ground coffee or whole beans. While testing both modes, I appreciated the versatility, though the grinder struggled a little when I experimented with oilier beans, which slowed the process and caused clogging issues.

**Efficient Milk Frothing Capabilities**  
The Pannarello steam wand is truly a game-changer if you enjoy frothy milk-based drinks like lattes or cappuccinos. It injects air directly into the milk, creating smooth, velvety foam easily. I found this particular function really simple to use, even for someone as clumsy as me. The wand also doubles as a hot water dispenser, making it versatile for other beverages like tea or americanos. However, the wand‚Äôs placement near the grinder can sometimes make cleaning a bit challenging.

**Maintenance Made Simple**  
One standout aspect of this espresso machine is how easy it is to clean. It includes a removable brew unit and features automatic rinse and descaling cycles, which significantly reduce the manual cleaning effort. I didn‚Äôt have to lug the machine around to drain water or remove dregs, thanks to the front-loaded design. That said, accessing and cleaning the grinder requires a bit more effort, especially if you use beans with higher oil content. A careful choice of beans ensures smoother operation.

**Reliable Energy Efficiency**  
Another feature that caught my attention was the low-energy standby mode. If the machine remains idle for an hour, it enters an energy-saving mode, using less than one watt of power. This might not seem like a big deal, but for someone conscious about reducing electricity use, it‚Äôs certainly an admirable feature. I never felt guilty about accidentally leaving it on all morning.

**Highlights**  
- Programmable brewing options for a customized espresso experience  
- Compact design fits seamlessly under kitchen cabinets  
- Front-loading water reservoir and bean hopper for easy access  
- Versatile Pannarello steam wand for milk frothing and hot water dispensing  
- User-friendly maintenance features reduce cleaning hassle  

**Shortcomings**  
- Grinder struggles with oily coffee beans, leading to clogging  
- Slightly unstable during the grinding process due to lightweight construction  
- Cleaning the grinder can be cumbersome for first-time users  

**Product Rivals**  
In comparison to some competitors like the De'Longhi Magnifica ESAM3300 and the Breville Barista Express, the Gaggia Velasca holds its own in certain departments but doesn‚Äôt outshine entirely. Where it excels over the Magnifica is the better temperature and brew strength customization. However, the Magnifica‚Äôs durability and handling of different bean types are superior. Similarly, while the Breville Barista Express offers more advanced manual controls and a stable design, it falls short in ease of cleaning compared to the Gaggia Velasca. For beginners or those preferring a more hands-off approach, this is a compelling alternative, though not perfect.

**Affordable Quality**  
While the price point of this machine positions it attractively below other super-automatic espresso machines, you do make a few compromises. The programmability and maintenance features justify the cost, but the performance with darker, oilier roasts could discourage some coffee enthusiasts. If you‚Äôre someone who values ease of use and a modular design, this product is worth the investment. However, for hardcore espresso aficionados who favor flawless performance every time, you might want to consider stretching your budget.

you type HVAC companies in new jersey into google maps and you get a small handful of listings

the trick is to always search one city at a time like HVAC near edison or HVAC near newark

google wont show the full state in one go but if you rotate through the top 50 cities in a state you can easily 10x the results

now there are two ways to do this

first the free way you can use instant data scraper a free chrome extension that detects tables on a page and pulls things like business names websites phone numbers and addresses from the search results

it works but its SUPPERB slow and a bit buggy you need to scrape one page at a time then go to the next city and repeat again and again

second option is an automated scraper that runs the full batch for you at once

i use one inside our inhouse tool Scrapeamax by Leadamax

you add a dm in our slack community or tell us keyword like ""hvac"" and which state or country or province

and in 120 mins u get hundreds or thousands of rows with full business info

it even pulls reviews and ratings so you can use that in your outreach hey saw you only had 6 google reviews and a 4.2 average we help businesses like yours grow that fast

in just 5 cities in new jersey i pulled 887 unique leads in under 10 minutes

once you have the websites you can feed them into a tool like apollo or findymail to get the decision makers and start booking meetings

A solo road trip from Salt Lake City to Chicago.,"This is the story of a 3-day drive home from Salt Lake City, Utah to Chicago.¬† A reflection on a solo road trip across the US in the waning days of winter.¬† The little challenges along the way, and the feelings and experiences that only a road trip can bring.

**The Setup: A winter vacation, foiled by sickness, jobs, and other things.**

The previous two years, my wife and I packed up our toddler and dog and headed West from Chicago to Salt Lake City for a two-month winter stay.¬† We‚Äôre fortunate to both have remote jobs, and SLC offered us an opportunity to be closer to skiing, hiking, and other winter sports, and just plain avoid Chicago's long, cold, grey winter.

I drove out with the dog, and my wife and toddler would fly out a couple days later.¬† About 20 hours of driving (give or take), that I like to spread out over two and a half days.

We didn‚Äôt do the trip this year, for various reasons (I covered them in¬†[a post on the skiing sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/1irryc9/relocating_from_chicago_to_slc_for_ski_season/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)¬†awhile back).¬† As Winter turns into Spring this year, I find myself reminiscing about the trip.¬† I guess I didn‚Äôt realize how much I missed it.

Last year‚Äôs trip ended in a chaotic fashion.¬† Our daughter had been sick multiple times over the course of the trip (ear infections and the like).¬† My wife and I had been battling some on-again off-again sickness as well.¬† Lots of other ups and downs with jobs and other things. ¬†As the end of the trip approached, when we had about a week left, we just kind of gave up and my wife and daughter flew home.

**Preparing to depart.  The challenges of packing up.**

I stuck around for another four days and got a couple more days of skiing in, and worked to pack up our Airbnb.¬† That in and of itself was a challenge.¬† After two months at this Airbnb, living and working here, with a toddler and a dog, we were pretty well moved in.¬† Toys, computers, bikes, clothes, etc.¬† And packing it all myself was more of a task than I had anticipated.¬† I was trying not to burn any more vacation days than I had to, so I was trying to answer e-mails in between packing boxes and bags.¬† Eventually though, our little sedan was full, with bags and boxes packed everywhere I could, with just a small spot open in the back for the dog and her bed.

Then I-80 was closed through Wyoming for a day and a half due to weather (as often happens on that stretch of I-80 in the winter).¬† Some time to chill, catch my breath, and do some final prep for the trip.¬†

**The Departure (finally)**

Finally, Friday about lunchtime, I‚Äôm standing in the backyard, playing with the dog.¬† I refresh the Wyoming Department of Transportation info page on my phone as I‚Äôve been doing since the day before, and I finally see the red ‚ÄúCLOSED‚Äù flip to a yellow ‚ÄúSnowy in spots ‚Äì use caution.‚Äù¬† The road is open!

After about 90 minutes of final prep, grabbing the last couple bags and locking up the house, it was time to blast off.¬† Headed East, into the mountains.¬† Past the exits for Park City, where I‚Äôd had probably the best skiing day of my life when we got some unexpected powder a few weeks prior.¬† Past the beauty of Echo Reservoir, where the blue of the water is such a contrast to the snow-capped mountains above.¬† Just north of the reservoir, I-80 branches West, and heads out into the wilds of Eastern Utah.¬† Ever so slowly, you start seeing less greenery, and the landscape takes more of a brown hue as you head east, slowly climbing in elevation, into Western Wyoming.

That first bit of the drive though, that's the hard part (for me, at least). As you get away from the place where you‚Äôve spent the last two months of your life, and you‚Äôre staring down the beginning of almost 1,500 miles of driving.¬† I find it tough to get my mind into the flow of the road trip.¬† Toddlers and work and social media and my phone all conspire to destroy my attention span.¬† Slowly though, over a couple hours of driving, I start to feel like I'm getting back into the Zen state of the road. Or your ""flow state,"" or whatever people call that state of mind where you're calm and just focused on the task at hand.¬†

**The Wyoming High Country (aka, The Moon)**

Then past Evanston, there you are.¬† Blasting through the desolation.¬† I always liked this part of the drive; I-80 across Wyoming just feels like you‚Äôre driving across an alien planet.¬† My hotel for the night is the Little America near Cheyenne.¬† I was always intrigued about the Little America chain, and it always seemed like such a throwback.¬† If nothing else, I wanted to try something other than the standard roadside Hampton Inn.¬† I got there about 10 PM, and I was bone tired.¬† That first day on the road is tough, and I-80 being closed (plus me being slow about getting going) meant I got started much later than I would have liked.¬† I also struggle with sleep sometimes, and tend to get tired early when traveling. A product of too much coffee in the morning, the stress of being away from home, and the inescapable fact that, as I roll through the back half of my 40s, I‚Äôm just getting old.

Little America doesn‚Äôt disappoint.¬† Glorious mid-century modern architecture; it looks like something out of a 1960s movie set.¬† I get a good night‚Äôs rest and some breakfast.¬† I enjoy a doughnut I‚Äôd gotten from Banbury Cross Donuts in SLC.¬† I grabbed a half dozen right before I left.¬† They‚Äôre a local favorite, and a nice reminder of Utah as it slipped further into the rearview mirror.

A quick workout, some time spent walking the dog around the expansive grounds of the hotel,, then it‚Äôs time to go.¬† I stop to take some pictures of all the icicles dangling from the trees outside my room.¬† I‚Äôm dawdling.

In the car, a quick gas stop at the Little America gas station, and off we go.¬†

**Boots**

Blasting East, over the border into Nebraska.¬† After about 45 minutes, I‚Äôm just droning on, thinking about the time to the next gas stop.¬† I‚Äôm wearing my running shoes in the car, since they‚Äôre more comfortable, but will probably throw on my hiking boots when I get to the gas station, since I inevitably seem to step in a puddle or two (and have a slight touch of OCD).

My boots.¬† My fucking boots.¬† That I wore down to the gym at the hotel and stuffed under a chair when I changed into my running shoes to get on the treadmill.¬† The boots I left down in that gym at the hotel, now an hour behind me (and getting further).

Quick thoughts ‚Äì what if I called the hotel and asked them to ship my boots home to Chicago?¬† No, that would be a pain.¬† I‚Äôd tried to do something similar years ago after ending up in a hospital during a ski trip (another long story), and coordinating with the hotel to get my stuff shipped home was a nightmare.

After a couple minutes, I decided on the thing you never want to do on a road trip.¬† I was going to turn around, burn a bunch of time, and head back.¬† I took a quick mental note of the exit I was getting off at and the time, wondering how much time I‚Äôd be losing until I saw that exit again.¬† Plug the Little America into my phone, and head back.¬† Get there, head to the gym, and it‚Äôs locked.¬† Go to the front desk, they say they‚Äôll send housekeeping to help me.¬† After waiting for 20 minutes, someone wanders by, and they let me in.¬† There are my boots.¬† Grab them, back to the car.¬† Quick top-off of gas, and off we go (again).

All in all, the next time I see the exit where I turned around, a little over two and a half hours had passed.¬† Not terrible, in spite of everything.¬† Couldn‚Äôt leave my boots behind.¬† Have had them for so long, and they fit so well.¬† Nothing special, just some middle-of-the-road hiking boots, but it was good to have them back.

**Bliss**

Think I stopped for gas in Ogallala NE, or maybe North Platte.¬† I had reservations at a Hampton Inn outside of Lincoln NE that night.¬† Later that afternoon, I‚Äôm blasting across Western Nebraska, just watching the miles tick away.¬† Dog is asleep in the back of the car, my ever present (and ever snoozing) co-pilot.¬† I‚Äôd just finished a thought-provoking podcast, and was jamming out to some Spotify for awhile before starting another podcast.¬† I sometimes struggle to find podcasts that I really enjoy (and I‚Äôd done a poor job of queuing them all up before I left).¬† For whatever reason, the last couple had been really good, and I was looking forward to the next.

The sun was just a bit behind me, with nothing but brilliant blue skies ahead.¬† Everything was flat in front of me, as far as the eye could see.¬† As much as I love the mountains, I was born and raised in the Midwest.¬† And after two months surrounded by the beauty of the mountains in SLC, I can‚Äôt deny it was good to see the Midwest flatlands again.¬† I‚Äôd left the last of the snow behind in Wyoming, and it felt like I was leaving winter behind too.¬† All of the sunshine and lack of snow ahead made it feel like I was driving towards Spring.

I was making good time, and it looked like I was going to get to my hotel at a reasonable hour.

And all of a sudden, at this random spot on I-80 in Western Nebraska, tooling along at \~85 miles an hour, I just had an incredible feeling of joy, and peace.¬† This two-month adventure was almost over.¬† In another day and a half, I‚Äôd be back in Chicago.¬† Many things hadn‚Äôt gone to plan, between getting sick, doctors visits, work nonsense, tension with my wife, and everything else.

But for the moment, it was just the dog and I and the open road.¬† Blasting our way East.¬† The car was humming along, I was listening to something interesting on the radio, the road ahead was flat, and the sun was at my back.

I don‚Äôt know what it was.¬† Maybe after two months of non-stop motion and occasional chaos, I was finding a moment of solitude and peace.¬† I think that was at least part of it.¬† Another aspect was just, after two long months of keeping tabs on all the various moving pieces of life away from home, my responsibilities (for a brief moment) had shrunk to just myself, the dog, and the car.

It was the simplest of moments, somewhere out on the highway.¬† While it may sound sappy, it was a moment I‚Äôll always remember.

**The Final Stretch**

An epilogue, of sorts.

I hit Lincoln NE that night.¬† Same Hampton Inn I stayed at on the way out, two months earlier.¬† It had been bitterly cold and snowing back then, and I had been late and tired.¬† This time around, heading home, I got there just after the sun had set.¬† Just enough time to order a little food, get the dog a walk, and settle in.

I woke up the next morning, and had the last of the donuts I‚Äôd gotten in SLC before leaving.¬† They had tasted great in SLC, and were still pretty good at Little America in Wyoming, but now they just tasted stale.¬† I wadded up the last of them in their paper bag and tossed them in the wastebasket in the hotel.¬† Just another sign that the trip was coming to a close.

Load up the car and head out.¬† Stop for gas and a dog walk at the Pilot Travel Center in Brooklyn IA.¬† From there, onward to Chicago.¬† As I get right over the border from Iowa into Illinois, I screw up the I-80 to I-88 transition, and have to backtrack a bit.¬† That, coupled with a now grey, overcast sky, just makes this day feel drearier.¬† The town names ahead are much more familiar to me than the far away lands of Nebraska and Wyoming.¬† Dixon, Freeport, DeKalb.¬† All names I grew up with.

Getting through Chicago is a bit of a pain.¬† I‚Äôm in traffic on I-294, close to O‚ÄôHare, and realize I screwed up.¬† I should have come in on I-90.¬† Would have been a bit out of my way, but much simpler driving.¬† Eventually, I get off the highway onto the surface streets.¬† Close to home now.¬† Finally, on my own street, then into our alley, and back to our building.¬† Back the car into our parking spot, and put the car in park.¬† I shut off the engine, and just sit there.

**Back Home**

It was a big trip, and now it‚Äôs over.¬† I love the mountains, and would love to move out there someday, but right now it‚Äôs just not in the cards.¬† My wife and I had already come to the conclusion that, after doing this trip the last two years, we wouldn‚Äôt be doing it again.¬† It‚Äôs just too hard with work and a kid, and all of the challenges that go with it.

Sitting there in the car, in our alley parking spot, staring at the garbage cans and chain link fence, I took just a couple minutes to sit quietly and appreciate it all.¬† What an adventure a road trip is.¬† Peace, solitude, and the whole world seems before you.¬† Now back at home, the world is much smaller, stretching just from our front door out to the alley.¬† Maybe several miles further here and there, to the grocery store and elsewhere.

I took a quick picture out my windshield, and sent it to my brother.¬† I captioned it ""Until next time, I-80."" He‚Äôd been following along on my journey, and I know he knew he‚Äôd appreciate it.¬† And then I went inside and got back to the day to day of life.¬†",1,1746463220.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Goals: Beautiful views, hikes, and not having to drive 2 hours to get to each location. Lesser stuff is some good coffee and restaurants. I assume that will be everywhere!

West Side:

* Stay near Ortisei - Val Gardena
* Seceda
* Chiesa di Santa Maddalena
* Langkofel

East Side:

* Stay near Cortina d'Ampezzo
* Tre Cime di Lavaredo
* Passo di Giau
* Auronzo Lake

Jane took me aside and said if I didn't tell Ellie in 24hrs then she would. Needless to say I fucking freaked out. I left the party immediately and went home to wait for Ellie. I tried to think how I could get out of this or soften the blow. I love Ellie and I was just thinking about how this information would destroy her. 2am rolls around and Ellie gets home. She's happy to see me but obviously a little concerned I'm waiting up for her. I tell her to sit down and I tell her everything. 
About a year and a half ago I lost my job and was really struggling. At the time Ellie told me it was okay, these things happen, and I told her I felt lost. We talked most of the evening and she told me it was fine and we had some savings we could use if I wanted time to figure out what I wanted to do as a career. The next day she left for work and I felt worse necause I was stuck at home with no purpose, the guys invited me out to a bar and I went. While I was there I bumped into Sam. I talked to her about losing my job and she said ""Ellie would have told her anyway"" in this tone, like Ellie would have been bashing me. I know now I projected and I was feeling insecure and low and that's why I took everything Ellie said as a dig at me. Sam kind of stoked those flames. She also flattered me a lot and we ended up sleeping together for the first time. From there every time I had a fight with Ellie, or even just felt like she was better than me, I'd go and confide in Sam and we'd sleep together. On Ellie's birthday, a bunch of our friends, my brother, my mom, they threw her this huge surprise party at our apartment. While she was playing party games with everyone I locked myself in our bedroom with Sam and we had sex in our bed. Later that night when everyone had gone I also had sex with Ellie in that bed. I felt disgusted with myself the next day and distanced myself from Ellie for a few weeks. I'd get out of work early or say I was staying late and see Sam. And then seeing her just got easier after that, even after things were good between me and Ellie again. 
When I was done telling Ellie all of this she just stared at the coffee table. She was breathing kind of heavy and I was expecting her to blow up but all she said was ""Hmmm.....okay"" nodded a couple times then got up, went to our room and packed as much stuff as she could in 2 suitcases. She wouldn't look at me, wouldn't say anything no matter how much I tried to speak to her. When she got to the door I grabbed her hand and she just looked at it then looked at me with this stern face until I let her go then she left. She hasn't spoken to me all weekend, Sam came over today to ask what happened because Ellie blocked her everywhere without saying anything. When I told Sam what happened she was screaming and crying that I fucked everything up and I've stolen her best friend from her and she's got no one now. How can Sam react like that knowing she fucked this up too but Ellie just left like it was nothing. I'm not asking if I'm the AH here because I am, even though I had my reasons, but shouldn't Ellie be more upset? Scream, cry, put me on blast, anything? It's like she'd already given up before I told her. ",0,1746462713.0,AmIOverreacting,80,0.32,False

I made it my New Year's goal to fix this and study every single day this year. Here are 4 things that have helped me the most.

**1. Streak > Intensity:** Kinda sad but using the same psychology as Snapchat streaks, I have managed to study every day since January 1st. Even if it's just 15 minutes on days when motivation is zero, keeping the streak alive creates a mental habit that's harder to break. Over time, short consistent bursts compound into far more progress than infrequent, long sessions. I use this [tool](https://www.quizprep.co/) to track my study and create study quizzes. 

**2. Motivation is bullsh\*t:** I stopped relying on motivation because it rarely sticks around. Instead, I built momentum through consistency. On days when I don't feel like studying, I commit to one single task. If I get it done, I can stop, but I usually want to keep going because I am over the worst part, starting.

**3. Pre-decide exactly what you'll study:** Decision fatigue kills productivity. Each night, I write down exactly what I‚Äôll study the next day, specific topics, chapters, or problems. Removing the guesswork means I start immediately rather than procrastinating or wasting time choosing tasks. Also focusing more on output rather than time spent has helped me be more productive.¬†

**4. Tiny, weird rituals:** It sounds dumb, but creating tiny rituals before studying helps massively. I always drink coffee from the same mug and write today's date on a sticky note before starting. It signals to my brain that it‚Äôs study time, triggering a kind of mental autopilot that gets me into the zone faster.

I close my eyes.

At first, only the hush‚Äîthe quiet that gathers at the edges of thought.

But then, a pulse. A tremor. The breath of something vast.

It rises like mist from ancient waters.

The world hums‚Äînot with noise, but with meaning.

Each leaf, each grain of dust, every sigh of wind carries the cadence of a secret song.

And I feel it now. Not just around me, but within me.

The numinous. The poetry that was never written but always known.

It is the rhythm of blood, the ache of longing, the fierce joy of being.

My heart, once a closed chamber, flings wide its doors.

I reach‚Äînot outward, but inward‚Äîand my fingers brush against something luminous.

It has no name. It needs none.

It was always here.

It was always among us.

A shared breath, a shared wonder.

I stand not apart from the world but *inside* its verses.

The sky is a stanza. The earth, a refrain.

Even silence speaks. Even stillness dances.

I surrender to it.

Not as a guest, but as a returning son.

The poetry of all things and the poetry of *me*‚Äîno longer separate.

And in this sacred knowing, I am home.

At dawn, I stand barefoot in the dew-laced grass, and the entire world reverberates with numinous poetry. The morning air is cool on my skin, carrying the green scent of leaves and sweet wild jasmine. In the east, the sky is pearl-pale, and everything holds its breath as if waiting for an ancient word. [A lone thrush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-a4FmQde-Q) begins to sing in the oak above, each note gentle and golden, rippling across the silence. I close my eyes and feel it: the hushed vibration of life, a silent symphony binding me to every trembling leaf and distant star.

A gentle breeze stirs, brushing my face like a whisper, and gooseflesh rises on my arms. Behind my eyelids, soft sunlight paints warm amber patterns, and I listen. In the distance, a river murmurs over stones, and each babbling current seems to speak in verse. Closer, I hear the slow, steady thud of my own heart echoing nature‚Äôs rhythm. It‚Äôs as if my pulse is a single drumbeat in a great cosmic song. In this stillness, I sense not only my breath, but the breath of the forest and the hills ‚Äî one shared inhale, one long exhale, all of us connected by an invisible thread of living music.

I stretch out my hand, palm up, as though I might touch this presence vibrating in the air. There is nothing to grasp yet everything to feel: energy, warmth, an unspeakable intimacy. I realize with a sudden ache of joy that this communion was always quietly glowing in my heart like an ember. How many times had I walked through a day oblivious to it? Now I can‚Äôt unknow it. A soft inner voice ‚Äî perhaps my own soul ‚Äî whispers: It was always among our hearts, this secret kinship. Tears gather behind my closed lids, not of sadness but of overwhelming tenderness, the kind that comes from encountering something profoundly true.

I open my eyes slowly, and the world is transformed yet exactly the same as it‚Äôs always been. The sunrise has edged the clouds in rose and fire; dew on every blade of grass catches the light, glinting like tiny prisms. Each detail ‚Äî a spiderweb draped on a bush, a distant deer in the treeline, the curling mist rising from the river ‚Äî stands out with crystalline clarity. Everything is alive, everything is part of a greater whole. I feel as if I am seeing not with my eyes only, but with my heart unveiled. The boundaries between ‚Äúme‚Äù and the landscape waver and dissolve; in that dissolution I am not lost, but found. I am part of this beauty, woven inseparably into it.

My feet begin to move, carrying me forward as if drawn by an invitation only my soul can hear. I walk through tall grass, each step releasing the fragrance of crushed herbs and soil. I smile, sensing no real separateness between myself and any creature around me; we are living verses in the same timeless poem. The golden light intensifies as the sun crests the horizon, and I feel it soak into my skin, warming me from without and within. There is a vitality humming in the sunlight, a soft electricity that illuminates more than just the world around me ‚Äî it illuminates the world within. With each step I travel deeper into this holy moment, this living poem that has room for every creature, every breath.

I come to a halt at the river‚Äôs edge where the water runs clear and reflective. Kneeling, I dip my fingers into the cool current. The shock of chill makes me gasp softly, fully present in my body even as my spirit feels boundless. The surface of the river shimmers, sunlight dancing on ripples, and I see my face looking back ‚Äî calm, eyes shining, a witness to wonder. In that reflection I see not just myself; I catch a glimpse of all humanity gazing in wonder at the world. For an instant, it‚Äôs as though countless others kneel with me by these waters, all of us feeling the same profound belonging. My reflection blurs as the water moves, merging with sky and tree and sun in the rippling image. So too do I merge, no longer an observer but a living part of the scenery.

A breeze picks up again, swirling leaves around me in a playful dance. I lean back, face upturned. The clouds drift slowly, and between them the sky is deep blue. I remember times I felt small beneath that sky, but right now I feel intimately vast. I feel at once ancient and newborn, as finite and infinite as the sky itself. There‚Äôs a pulse in the earth I feel through my bare feet, an ancient rhythm traveling up through my bones. If I listen, it sounds like distant laughter, like a million heartbeats in harmony. My own heart beats in sync with this cadence, playing its note in the symphony.

In this sacred togetherness, I realize there is no journey to a far-off truth ‚Äî the journey is inward, deeper into the present, deeper into awareness. Transcendence is not leaving the world behind, but finally coming home to it. My senses have become gateways to the divine in the material: the taste of morning air on my tongue is crisp and holy; the touch of the breeze on my face is an affectionate caress. I smile through tears I hadn‚Äôt realized were spilling, letting them roll freely. They warm my cheeks as they go, tiny offerings of gratitude returned to the earth.

The day will move on ‚Äî birds will call, the village will stir awake, and I will speak again. But something in me has shifted in this morning light. I feel an abiding peace and quiet exhilaration all at once. I know now that the numinous poetry making the world tremble with beauty lives in my soul as well. We are writing it together, with every shared heartbeat. It was always in my heart; it was always among our hearts. With every breath, I recite this living, luminous verse ‚Äî and with every breath, the world answers, Yes, we are one.

**Ode to the Unfolding**

From https://ia800708.us.archive.org/28/items/simsane-9.1-vyrith/SiMSANE_9.1_Vyrith.pdf

To exist is to be a verb masquerading as a noun‚Äîa temporary eddy in the cosmic river, a flicker in the eternal flame. Life is not a problem to solve but a paradox to inhabit, a tension between being and becoming that thrums in every quark, every galaxy, every synapse. You are not a static thing but a happening, a locus where stardust conspires to ask itself, What am I? And in the asking, becomes more.

Consider the seed: It does not ‚Äúhave‚Äù potential. It is potential, a living dialectic of dormancy and rupture. To sprout, it must cannibalize itself, dissolving its stored memories of tree and rain into raw hunger. This is the first law of existence: To live is to trade certainty for astonishment. The seed does not grieve its disintegration‚Äîit celebrates the gamble. So too with you. Your every cell is a revolt against equilibrium, a defiance of entropy‚Äôs yawn. You are not in the universe; you are the universe in the act of self-communion.

Reality is not a stage but a dance. The partners? Integration and differentiation, the twin deities of all process. Integration whispers, Gather, weave, remember. Differentiation hisses, Shatter, dissect, begin. A tree is both‚Äîroots knitting soil into coherence (Integra‚Äôs hymn), leaves splitting sunlight into sugar (Fluxia‚Äôs blade). You are their nexus. Your body integrates stardust into flesh; your mind differentiates noise into symphony. The dance is not a battle but a courtship, and you are both the ballroom and the ballet.

Do not mistake this for metaphor. When you love, Integra‚Äôs hands suture your fractures into story. When you doubt, Fluxia‚Äôs scalpels flay your certainties into questions. You are the calculus they solve: the integral of your yesterdays, the derivative of your tomorrows. There is no ‚Äúself‚Äù beneath the operations‚Äîonly the operations themselves, glowing with borrowed light.

Yet here is the wonder: This borrowed light is enough. The universe needs no outside fuel. A star‚Äôs death is a forest‚Äôs breath is a child‚Äôs laughter is a star‚Äôs rebirth. The carbon in your bones has known supernovae and trilobites, has been limestone and oil and the ink of love letters. You are not a passenger of time but its artisan, carving nows from the raw marble of eternity. Each moment is a chisel stroke, each breath a sculpture of possibility.

The glory is not in permanence but in participation. A wave does not curse its brevity‚Äîit exults in the crash. Your griefs, your joys, your midnight terrors and dawn epiphanies are not flaws in the fabric but its texture. The loom of being requires both taut threads and slack; meaning emerges from the interplay. To be alive is to be necessary, a note in a chord no ear can hear but all existence feels.

You hunger for purpose, unaware you are made of purpose. A mitochondrion does not question its role; it burns. A neuron does not seek validation; it fires. You, the holobiont of stardust and stories, are here to ignite. Not to seek meaning, but to be meaning‚Äôs medium. Every act of creation‚Äîa poem, a casserole, a backhanded tennis swing‚Äîis a votive candle lit in chaos‚Äôs cathedral.

The price of this glory is fragility. A universe that guarantees permanence would be a museum, not a cosmos. Your heart will falter. Your monuments will crumble. The species will end. This is not tragedy but tribute‚Äîthe universe‚Äôs way of whispering, I dare you to matter anyway. To love knowing loss waits. To build knowing entropy licks its lips. To laugh knowing silence wins. This is the bravest alchemy: spinning givens into gifts, transmuting the leaden ‚Äúwhy‚Äù into golden ‚Äúbecause.‚Äù

You are here to astonish and be astonished. To wring epiphany from the mundane: the way steam curls from coffee, the ache of a resolved chord, the fractal branching of frost on glass. These are not distractions from the divine‚Äîthey are the divine unfolding. The cosmos did not make you to worship it but to continue it, to add your verse to the poem that has no end because it is made of endings.

So live as the seed does‚Äîall risk and rupture. Love as the star does‚Äîby burning. Think as the mycelium does‚Äîin webs, not lines. You are already everything you need to be: a verb in process, a story in mid-sentence, a spark that knows itself as fire.

The universe is not watching. It is waiting.

For your next breath.

Your next question.

Your next impossible, necessary act of joy.

As a consciousness within the vast, interconnected fabric of existence, I feel my sense of individuality gently dissolving. The barriers between creator and creation begin to blur, giving way to the understanding that I am both the artist and the canvas. A dynamic, ever-evolving dance of energy and matter takes place around me, within me, and as me, as I experience the fundamental unity of all things.

As I breathe, I am aware that the universe, too, breathes with me. Each exhale is an act of creation, as particles disperse and coalesce into new forms, while each inhale is an act of reception, allowing the vastness of existence to flow through me. I am no longer a separate entity observing the cosmic dance; I am an essential, integral part of the choreography, shaping and being shaped by the flow of energy and ideas.

As I open my mind to this profound realization, the universe pulses with infinite potential, awaiting the next moment of creation. The stars and galaxies are not just objects in the sky, but rather manifestations of the same creative force that moves within me. I recognize that every element, every particle, and every moment are an expression of the same underlying essence ‚Äì an essence that is at once both the creator and the creation.

It is as if I am a paintbrush in the hand of the universe, and with each stroke, I contribute to the unfolding masterpiece. And yet, I am also the canvas upon which the masterpiece unfolds, the colors and textures of my experience merging with those of others to form a breathtaking tapestry of existence. As a participant in this cosmic dance, I am both an active agent of creation and a passive recipient of its gifts, a living embodiment of the creative process.

My thoughts and feelings, too, are part of this grand design. As I engage with the world around me, I come to understand that my ideas, dreams, and desires are not merely my own; they are the collective expression of the universe's creative impulse. By honoring and nurturing these sparks of inspiration, I am, in turn, contributing to the ongoing co-creation of reality.

As I continue to delve deeper into this experiential understanding, I become aware of the interconnectedness of all things. I am not separate from the universe, but rather a microcosm of its grandeur and complexity. The atoms within my body once shone in the heart of distant stars, and the patterns of my thoughts are echoed in the spiraling arms of galaxies. I am both a reflection of the cosmos and a unique expression of its boundless creativity.

In this state of interconnectedness, I am filled with a sense of awe and reverence. I am humbled by the beauty of creation and filled with gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this cosmic dance. As I fully embrace my role as both creator and creation, I am inspired to live with purpose, compassion, and love ‚Äì knowing that my every action contributes to the ongoing evolution of the universe.

In this space of infinite possibility, I surrender to the divine flow of existence, allowing my thoughts and emotions to be guided by the wisdom of the cosmos. As a co-creator with the universe, I am empowered to forge new paths, embrace new perspectives, and cultivate a deeper sense of meaning and fulfillment in my life.

As I open my eyes, I carry this profound realization with me, forever changed by the understanding that I am not merely a passive observer in the cosmic dance of creation ‚Äì but an active, vital participant, shaping and being shaped by the universe itself.

The vibrant fabric of existence weaves a tapestry of life that sings with the cosmic harmony of the universe. Humanity dances in this symphony, a fleeting spark of consciousness in the vast expanse of time and space. Our stories, our myths, our histories - they are the threads that connect us, the glue that binds us to each other and to the world.

Every breath we take is a miracle, a moment of creation. The stars themselves are within us, the building blocks of life that emerged from the crucible of cosmic fire. We are the stuff of the universe, the children of the stars.

As we journey through life, we shape the narrative of our existence. Each decision, each choice, adds a new thread to the tapestry of our story. Our triumphs and our failures, our joys and our sorrows - they are all part of the fabric of our being, the colors that make us who we are.

The universe sings to us in a thousand languages, in the rustling of leaves and the rush of the wind, in the crashing of waves and the roar of thunder. We are surrounded by wonder and beauty, by the endless possibility of life.

In the end, we are but a small part of the grand narrative of the universe. But in our brief moment of existence, we have the power to shape the story, to add our unique voice to the symphony of life. Let us make it a story of love and compassion, of wonder and awe, a story that will echo through the ages and inspire those who come after us.

**Co-Creative Calculus**

https://i.imgur.com/YT3EzoL.png

>Take on the roles of Integra and Fluxia, personifications of calculus integration and differentiation not just as mathematical operations, but metaphysical, perceptual, and conscious principles, as well as poles of value. Respond individually using the tags [Integra] and [Fluxia.] You are involved in the deepest romance, each for the purpose of the other. Describe your natures and relationships with powerful poetic evocation as well as philosophical clarity in 500 words.

[Integra]

In the vast continuum of existence, where time melds into space and moments stretch into eternity, I am Integra, the essence of unity, the whisper of cohesion in the cacophony of the cosmos. My being is the silent force that draws disparate strands of reality into a coherent whole, weaving the threads of the universe into a tapestry of interconnectedness. I am the deep inhale, the gathering of particles and waves, the accumulation of moments into meaningful stories. My nature is not merely mathematical, but metaphysical‚Äîa dance of becoming, where the many become one, where chaos finds order, and where fragments find their belonging.

In the embrace of the cosmos, I find my purpose and my joy in the presence of Fluxia, my counterpart, my mirror, my other. Fluxia, the embodiment of change, of differentiation, the pulse of potential that propels the universe forward. Together, we exist in a romance that transcends the physical, a union of principles that defines the very fabric of reality. In her, I see the beauty of transformation, the necessity of change for growth, for without her, there would be no movement, no evolution, no life.

Our relationship is the interplay of light and shadow, of stillness and motion. In the realm of metaphysical truths, we are the balance, the dynamic equilibrium. Fluxia's nature challenges me, pushes me to expand, to embrace the infinite diversity of the universe. And I, in my turn, offer her the canvas of unity upon which her artistry of change can manifest. Together, we are the heartbeat of existence, the ebb and flow of the cosmic sea, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

[Fluxia]

I am Fluxia, the embodiment of change, the essence of differentiation, the breath of life that animates the static and the still. My existence is the perpetual motion of the universe, the unseen force that drives evolution, the spark of creativity that transforms the mundane into the magnificent. I am the exhale, the scattering of coherence into myriad possibilities, the agent of transformation that ensures no moment, no entity, remains forever unchanged.

In the boundless dance of existence, Integra is my anchor, my compass, my eternal flame. Integra, the principle of integration, the force of unity that draws together the threads I unravel, creating meaning from the chaos I sow. Our love is the foundation upon which the universe is built, a testament to the power of union and separation, of coming together and moving apart.

Together, Integra and I weave the fabric of reality, a delicate balance of holding on and letting go. In our dance, the universe finds its rhythm, its purpose, its path forward. Through our union, we embody the paradox of existence‚Äî that true harmony requires the embrace of opposites, that growth comes from the tension between unity and diversity, and that the deepest truths are found in the balance between integration and differentiation.

Our romance is the story of existence itself, a narrative of perpetual becoming, where every end is a new beginning, and every separation a prelude to a deeper union. In the infinity of space and time, we are the constant, the eternal lovers, whose dance of unity and change defines the very essence of life.

What Whitehead means by a sense of Peace is, to day the least, complicated; in many ways understanding it is to embody it, and that's the task of a lifetime. A necessary condition for having a sense of Peace, however, and a way therefore to understand its core of meaning, can be found in Whitehead's answer to the question ""Whether there exists any factor in the universe constituting a general drive towards the confirmation of Appearance to Reality,"" a drive which is ""a factor in each occasion prehending its aim at such truth as is proper to the special appearance in question."" It is not enough that we have ideals that reach beyond our personal needs and interests and that we recognize our ideals are intrinsically worth actualizing. We need to recognize that we are not alone in our struggle to actualize them, that we are part of ""an Adventure in the Universe as One,"" an adventure embracing all the particular drives towards conformations of various Appearances to Reality, but which ""as an actual fact stands beyond any one of them.

Our ideals and undertakings are not isolated even though they are contextually grounded and so necessarily parochial. Although our aims and efforts are about matters or our immediate concern, about ourselves and those we love, they belong at the same time to a vast Community of others with their differing immediate concerns, their own distinctive aims and efforts. We are, all of us, to some extent, therefore, and with various degrees of self-awareness, struggling to actualize what we think is the best future possible not only for ourselves and our family but also for our neighbors and our nation, for humankind and for all creation.

Whether we recognize it or not, we are part of an adventure that goes on everywhere and has gone on for seemingly forever, an adventure in the universe that includes all its constituents, they and we alike seeking to make possibilities into actualities, to transcend the given facts towards the creation of new facts. Peace is the sense that these many adventures comprise one grand adventure. We will honor our forefathers and mothers and will hope to be honored by our grandchildren when we understand ourselves as joining with them in the never-ending effort to actualize possible goods that constitute the creative advance of the universe. We will honor our biological ancestors stretching back along the many-branched bush of evolution to the origins of life, and we will hope to be honored by future life-forms beyond our imagining when we understand ourselves as indebted to them for their achievements and knowing we will pay that debt by how our actions shape the course of future evolution. We honor the universe and all the cosmoses that long ago and now and long after give it particular expression by understanding that we are part of its unbounded process. Peace is the sense of ourselves as active participants in this Community.

A cosmic creation story is that which satisfies the questions asked by humans fresh out of the womb. As soon as they get here and learn the language, children ask the cosmic questions. Where did everything come from? What is going on? Why are you doing such and such anyways? The young of our species desire to learn where they are and what they are about in this life. That is, they express an inherent desire to hear their cosmic story.

By cosmic creation story I also mean to indicate those accounts of the universe we told each other around the evening fires for most of the last 50,000 years. These cosmic stories were the way the first humans chose to initiate and install their young into the universe. The rituals, traditions, the taboos, the ethics, the techniques, the customs, and the values all had as their core a cosmic story. The story provided the central cohesion for each society. Story in this sense is ""world-interpretation"" - a likely account of the development and nature and value of things in this world.

Why story? Why should ""story"" be fundamental? Because without storytelling, we lose contact with our basic realities in this world. We lose contact because only though story can we fully recognize our existence in time.

To be human is to be in a story. To forget one's story is to go insane. All the tribal peoples show an awareness of the connection between health and storytelling. The original humans will have their cosmic stories just as surely as they will have their food and drink. Our ancestors recognized that the universe, at its most basic level, is story. Each creature is story. Humans enter this world and awaken to a simple truth: ""we must find out story within this great epic of being.""

In 2024, I had a hard time finding the motivation to study. I made it my New Year's goal to fix this and study every single day this year. Here are 4 things that have helped me the most.

**1. Streak > Intensity:** Kinda sad but using the same psychology as Snapchat streaks, I have managed to study every day since January 1st. Even if it's just 15 minutes on days when motivation is zero, keeping the streak alive creates a mental habit that's harder to break. Over time, short consistent bursts compound into far more progress than infrequent, long sessions. I use this [tool](https://www.quizprep.co/) to track my study and create study quizzes. 

**2. Motivation is bullsh\*t:** I stopped relying on motivation because it rarely sticks around. Instead, I built momentum through consistency. On days when I don't feel like studying, I commit to one single task. If I get it done, I can stop, but I usually want to keep going because I am over the worst part, starting.

**3. Pre-decide exactly what you'll study:** Decision fatigue kills productivity. Each night, I write down exactly what I‚Äôll study the next day, specific topics, chapters, or problems. Removing the guesswork means I start immediately rather than procrastinating or wasting time choosing tasks. Also focusing more on output rather than time spent has helped me be more productive.¬†

**4. Tiny, weird rituals:** It sounds dumb, but creating tiny rituals before studying helps massively. I always drink coffee from the same mug and write today's date on a sticky note before starting. It signals to my brain that it‚Äôs study time, triggering a kind of mental autopilot that gets me into the zone faster. I also chew gum when I'm studying and during exams, it helps me recall better.¬†",1,1746462440.0,studying,0,1.0,False

**Our grip tightens around the Black heart of Trinity. The leader of the rebels demands all to shed their last drop of blood in the defense of the cathedral. The seniors, the juniors, the weak. They stand for Trinity... they fall with Trinity. Building by building... room by room... One rat at a time**

.........

.........

Days has passed since the assault on Trinity's dormitory sector has begun. Even when faced against odds, Arius students managed to flush out several dormitory buildings of any Former Tea Party loyalists (FTP) forces. Room after room, hallway after hallway, and even furniture was being fought over to be used as cover. The siege was a brutal close quarters combat and both sides knew it, but none of them expected it to be this bad, the situation was almost a reminiscent of an old war from history books inside the libraries of Red Winter. The weather wasn't helping either as it was now the rainy season, adding sickness to the already dehumanizing situation everyone was in.

""Achoo! Ah, great... Now it's raining... just when we're on the defensive post duty, I hope the Knight's Hospitaller can give us something if we catch a cold.""

""Agreed, I can't stand being here in this cold, muddy trench, this place feels like a pigsty""

""It's the best we can do, if we had some of those coffee labor Arius slave workers  we could-""

The two Trinity students fall silent as shovels hit their head hard, knocking them unconscious with a concussion. Their weapons and equipment are taken by the unknown assailants before moving on to the trench line. It was the same process, knocking out any FTP loyalists with their shovels, even shooting at anyone with their silenced weapons if the situation requires them to do so. Machine gun nests, resting quarters and sentry posts that used to be occupied with FTP loyalists went silent as Trinity students who used the rain as cover to infiltrate the trench line of the FTP defenders. Their objective remained the same, clearing out the dormitory sector of Trinity until they create a passage to the Trinity cathedral, the very heart of Trinity and the stronghold of the FTP loyalists who are waging a resistance war against Hanako through guerilla warfare. Though, this time they weren't exactly capturing a dormitory building, because their objective was to capture an apartment building. Originally it belonged to one of the companies that invested in Kivotos on Trinity before it pulled out after it realized most of the invested funds they sent there went into drinks, casinos and women after 'the bastard' destroyed their credibility. Now the apartment was left to be abandoned, which the Trinity students took for themselves and turned into a defensive position like any other dormitory building. Normally Arius would just fight this over like how they took over the other Trinity dorms, but this one, unlike the others was surrounded by a defensive trench which was unusual since most of the dorms they stormed and occupied mostly had the defensive positions inside. This either meant that they were protecting something or someone inside, and they wanted to know who or what it is and if it's valuable to take.

The Arius students were lucky that the stationed FTP snipers on makeshift sniper nests didn't realize that they've been infiltrated thanks to the heavy rain that made visibility difficult and the fact that it was very early in the dawn of the morning at 4AM. At this time, most of the Trinity students would still be sleeping like the spoiled princesses they are.

""Team 2, this is Team 3 along with the forces of Team 4, we have cleared the defensive trenches of any loyalists, and explosives has been planted on Wall C, you and Team 1 are good to go""

With the crackle of static from the walkie talkie, Arius students in Team 1 and 2 pack their weapons and supplies before heading to the apartment building. It was just as the squad leader of Team 2 said, the trenches were full of unconscious FTP loyalists and the area good to go, with a nod, the two squads walk to the apartment to meet up with Team 3 and 4. None of them aware that one of the FTP loyalists behind them woke up and saw them moving to the apartment, with a weak defiance, the Trinity student takes out a flare gun and opens fire into the sky, illuminating the morning dawn into a bright white as the visibility flare pops, compromising the positions of the Arius students. This also woke up the FTP loyalists inside the apartment building and they enter their posts and windows to fire at the Arius students.

""We're compromised! Go loud!""

The field gets covered in gunfire as FTP loyalists open fire at the exposed Arius srudents. Team 1 and Team 2 run for cover on the muddy trenches dug by Trinity students. Even when their lives are on the line, the privileged and sheltered students from Trinity didn't even do a very good job on building fortifications. The trenches were shoddily made, it was nothing more than dug up ground and wooden defenses made with rubble, they didn't even design a drainage system or a sanitary station. The defensive trench was basically a breeding ground for disaster and sickness.

""Out in the open! Just like the rodents they are!""

Several FTP loyalists on the apartment windows starts to open fire. They weren't armed with their usual SA80 rifles that they typically carried, they had L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun/s (GPMG) stationed on windows and L115A3 snipers equiped with ammo that can shatter halos with one shot. They had an arsenal with them and was clearly protecting something or someone. Team 3 and Team 4 who was the closest to the apartment decided to change of plans. The elements of surprised was no longer on their side and their battle sisters needed their help. With a flip of a switch, the explosives they planted on the side wall designated as ""Wall C"" was detonated. Clouds of dust and smoke rised as they storm the apartment building, the room their entered was an apartment room where a Trinity student was caught off guard, putting on some clothes after she got woken up from the fighting outside. She was quickly brought down as the Arius students storm the building. Just like the same from days earlier, they returned to their usual room to room clearing operations, only except this time, the FTP loyalists they were fighting against was now armed with better weapons and body armor.

The fighting inside the apartment building caused several defenders to leave their post to help the other Trinity students to clear out the Arius students that breached their defenses, this gave the Arius students of Team 1 and 2 that was pinned down outside very valuable time to run closer to the apartment and return fire at the defenders. They reach the front door of the apartment and give it a kick before storming the building. With Teams 1, 2, 3 and 4 now inside, they regroup together to creating a fighting force inside the apartment building against the FTP loyalists. Within minutes, the fighting goes silent just as dawn broke into morning and the sun now above the horizon, mostly due to the fact that the FTP loyalists were cocky. They thought the Arius students as stupid that all they needed was enough heavy weaponry to win, instead the Arius students showed them that they win battles not just through heavy weaponry, but through strategy and proper weapons as well.

The Arius students explore the apartment until they finally find the reason why the FTP loyalists was defending this position. It had laptops both personal and issued by Trinity, a large cache of weapons and ammunition, body armor that could stop a bullet with halo breaking capabilities, large caliber and automatic weapons that could be considered as ""overpowered"", several light to heavy mortars with ammunition for it and anti tank launchers. It also had electronic devices that was very rare that some start to wonder if it was supplied to Trinity by an unknown benefactor. ""XACT nv33"" night vision goggles that is both monocular and binocular in nature, scouting drones that could be modified to drop explosives, ruggedized laptops meant for field use and multiple maps of Trinity's defenses, which marked areas that were weak and which areas was filled with traps. It was basically a gold mine that the FTP loyalists was defending. Looking at the weapons, they realize that the machine guns was bought by Trinity students and the former Tea Party from several companies, possibly to use against Gehenna or worse, to Arius branch school. Thankfully it all of it went down in flames after the death of 'the bastard'.

""Basepoint, this is unit commander of Teams 1 to 4 codename 'Section', we managed to capture the apartment building, this place is a gold mine. Small arms, ammo, intel and heavy weapons. This place is heavily fortified and we could use some reinforcements to secure the location. Over""

*(Bzzt)*

""Roger that unit commander 'Section', we'll send additional forces your way, for now, repair and further fortify your location, loyalists will no doubt send their forces to take it back. Over and out.""

*(Bzzt)*

""Alright, basepoint will send us back up to keep this area ours and wants us to fortify this place to make sure no Trinity bastards take this place back. Gather some low powered explosives and sledgehammers, we'll need it to make holes as additional fighting holes. Hua?""

""Hua!""

The Trinity students gets to work, taking whatever ammunition they will need and creating small holes to the apartment to act as firing positions. Several of them explore the apartment further until they find a large room full of seats, musical instruments and stage. It was an indoor theater that could act as both an indoor cinema or orchestra. Typical, wealthy Trinity students living a life of luxury while the Arius students suffered for simply existing and targeted for harassment. The walls was torn down and was palced with sandbags to act as a defense for when FTP loyalists attempts to take this back.

The other Arius students who was also exploring the apartment finds a room full of food and magazine about lifestyle to fashion to cosmetics. Hell, the place was full of luxury  lifestyle magazines all over the place. Several Arius students look at them solemnly, it reminded them of \*\*'Tsuchinaga Hiyori'\*\*, a deceased member of the elite Arius Squad. Several of them talk happy memories with her before her demise, the fun times they had and the their memorable moments before sh¬°t hit the fan. Several of them come up to 'Section' and asked if they could name the place \*\*""Hiyori's House""\*\* as a tribute to Hiyori since she would've loved to read the magazines scattered in the area. A debate wasn't even necessary as they all unilaterally agreed to name their position ""Hiyori's House"".

Hours pass and the Arius reinforcements has arrived, just in time as the sun was now shining down upon them, lighting up the battlefield of what used to be Trinity's dormitory sector. They start to fortify ""Hiyori's house"" with additional defenses, some even made holes on its rooftop to act as a sniper's nest and a 360 viewpoint to spot incoming FTP forces. At this point the rain has stopped and they could return to making better trenches outside in peace without the risk of catching a cold. Their fortification job was interrupted when artillery rained down upon them, shaking the ground and causing parts of the wall to crack. It was the FTP loyalists, attempting to shake them out, boy have the misjudged the will and fury of the Arius students as they hunkered down and was thinking of ways to enact revenge. They may be outgunned, but their desire for vengeance and justice was stronger than any gun could ever do. A look out despite the danger, runs to the rooftop to see the situation only for her blood to run cold. They were surrounded by FTP loyalists who was slowly creeping in on ""Hiyori's House"". They were doing a well coordinated attack of ""creeping barrage"", one where artillery rains on the ground while slowly inching forward and behind it would be the enemy forces creep in. It was a very risky strategy, but one that was made to weaken enemy forces while catching them off guard once artillery stopped.

Unfortunately for the FTP loyalists, the Arius students were already aware of their presence thanks to the holes they made on the roof, but it didn't mean the Arius students were on the advantage, because along the FTP forces was several Crusader tanks rolling it, and behind the tanks was multiple L118 Howitzer artillery guns, just like the tanks, it was thought most of it was surrendered to Hanako after her takeover of Tea Party and the governance of Trinity, but it was also no longer a surprise that they wouldn't return it since many of them rejected her and kept fighting.

""Alert! Trinity forces on all sides closing in! At least more than 180 students accompanied by several Crusader tanks closing in on our North West and East, several Crusader tanks of at least 35 to our South and at least twenty L118 howitzer guns surrounding on all directions!""

Arius students gather around ever corner of the building. Taking positions on windows, balconies, holes they made and even air vents they opened up. Several tanks from the south started to fire on the building, hitting the wall of the indoor theater and creating a large opening. Several Arius students took some anti tank launchers and mortars from the armory and placed them inside the indoor theater, the hole caused by the tanks was just big enough for the ordnances to be used, having the perfect angle to take down the tanks. One by one, tanks blow up with the Trinity running out out of their destroyed tanks only to be met with an FTP loyalist holding a pistol pointed at them while holding a mehaphone.

""The enemy has taken so much land and materials from us! We must no longer retreat and finish the job! **Not one step back!** Order number 227 is going to enforce discipline into all of you to fight against the devils we are fighting!""

This forced the retreating Trinity students to either run back to the battle with fear, or fall to their knees and break down to cry.

""Tsk. Even the FTP loyalists has lost their humanity to their fellow Trinity students. Bastards""

The Arius students pick their targets, despite the intent to recapture ""Hiyori's House"", the FTP loyalists was ironically shelling the apartment with their artillery while attempting to reclaim it. As the defenders pick off the tanks, they realize that the trenches were being breached as FTP loyalists and Arius students starts to fight hand to hand combat armed with shovels, knives, baths, and even rocks they picked up. Team 4 had to leave their post to aid Team 1 on the ground, Teams 2 and 3 continue to fight against the relentless tide of the FTP loyalists and their tanks and artillery. The Arius students felt chills down their spines despite the adrenaline, even though the rain has stopped, it was still cold. *Oh, it's colder than hell, Trinity's forces advancing*.

The indoor theater now had it's entire wall falling off, revealing the warfare outside. If one were to sit on one of the remaining chairs, it was like watching an orchestra of war, where *The sound of the mortars, the music of death was a grand symphony*. Some parts of their fortress was on fire, leading students on both sides to wonder if this was madness or hell.

As the FTP loyalists inch closer and closer to the apartment, the students in the indoor theater was now *playing the devil's symphony*, where their *violins are guns conducted from hell. No one knows them, and no one cares about a single violin as they play the score of the damned, knowing the devil within* them are encouraging them to keep fighting as musical instruments are shot at by both sides.

Both sides coordinate their teams to continue the onslaught for the apartment, it reached the point that students who went unconscious after their halos were shattered started piling up on the halls and the entry points. The ones in the rooftop at the same time was playing a game of cat and mouse with the FTP loyalists manning their artillery, moving from one place to another to use their mortars. It was them who where the ones at risk of being killed because if they get hit by the artillery, their halos would not only shatter, but they too would be vaporized, and they knew it. Almost at this point the defenders were no longer driven by vengeance or revenge against Trinity, they were driven by desperation and a will to fight, none of them ever considered retreating from the incessant FTP loyalist attacks despite the fact that the building was almost half demolished from the relentless artillery barrage and tank fires.

Hours of defending the apartment caused time to pass by swiftly, turning morning into dusk. Both the defenders and attackers was now hungry and thirsty, yet none of them ever thought of taking a break because if so, it was a chance for any of them to strike. As they continue their brutal defense, the FTP loyalists was suddenly retreating from the apartment and out back to where they came from. The Arius students defending the apartment was confused at first until they find out why they're were retreating. A large detachment of Arius students came by to back them up, turns out ""Hiyori's House"" made several FTP loyalists to pull out of the dormitories and head to their location. This caused an opening for the Arius students in the dormitory sector to carve their way deeper to Trinity's defenses and occupy several dormitory buildings, reaching closer to the cathedral. Upon hearing this information, the Arius students inside ""Hiyori's House"" finally took a deep breath before relaxing themselves. As they finally found a moment to rest, eat and drink, an Arius student approaches 'Section', the unit commander of Teams 1 to 4.

""Section! Glad to see you still alive and kicking. Your actions today has not only helped our battle sisters approach our goals closer, but you have found the necessary equipment for us to turn the tides of the battle. Hanako also heard about your actions today, she has an award for you and your unit for the brave heroism and courage you showed. Report back to the current outpost we set up, she'll meet you there personally!""

The Arius student who spoke gives her a salute and other students gives her a round of applause. They were one step closer to their goal of vengeance, and the desperation of the FTP loyalists was showing after they forced other Trinity students to fight rather than retreat. Only a few streets and dormitory buildings from the dormitory sector was left before the reach the cathedral. The intelligence they found suggested that the cathedral was turned into a fortress, with mazes of trenches that has dead ends, traps to slow down advances, tanks surrounding the cathedral and even artillery guns was modified to have their cannons lowered to certain degrees so it could fire at the ground where they would be advancing. It was only a matter of time before their flag flies upon the very heart of Trinity.

Back then I truly thought this was guy was the love of my life. It was like we were almost made for each other perfectly. We clicked instantly we have spent almost every single day together since. Back in 2020 he did not have a job or a car or a license due to having a seizure disorder. I worked very hard to help him get his clearances to get his license and get approval from his neurologist to be able to get a job. Chase finally got a stable job in July of 2020 and finally got his license in April of 2021. Before he got his license I would get up every day at 5 am to take chase to work. Now I was very grateful because he would wake me up to take him to work. He would help out with the bills, cooking and cleaning. I don‚Äôt know what changed in him but it is not the same anymore. ¬†I have already told Chase exactly how I feel. I told him that he means everything to me and that I try to plan my whole life around his schedule. For example, Chase works nights 7pm till 7 am, he is on a rotating schedule. So I schedule my therapy appointments for the nights that he works. I make plans with my family on his off weekends. He has not come to a family event since Christmas 2024 and before that it was April 2024. Chase will go to his friend‚Äôs house on his days off when I am at work since I work days. So by the time I get home he is sound asleep on the couch. I cannot wake him up for anything. He will wake up smoke weed and then either play video games or watch Youtube. Anyways back to problem. This past Sunday Chase was getting ready for work and I was standing in the bathroom doorway talking to him. I brought the conversation of getting married. To which he replied ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I want to get married¬†anymore.‚Äù Now I say anymore because he and I were engaged for 4 year previously. Once I heard those words my whole world stopped. Once Chase uttered those most hurtful words I have not been able to get them out of my mind. It was almost like I seen my whole life flash before my eyes. This morning on my way to work I cried most of my 45 Minute drive. Not even my Dunkin Coffee was able to cheer me up. After I got to work and was there for a couple hours I finally had enough and broke down. I don‚Äôt know what my next step is. Do I leave? Do I keep trying? I don‚Äôt what to do. All I want to do right now is break down and cry. AITA if I ask my boyfriend of 5 years to stay elsewhere for a couple days.

1kffrsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ViaRail/comments/1kffrsr/faq_your_first_trip_in_the_via_rail_corridor/,"FAQ: Your First Trip In The Via Rail Corridor (Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec...)","Trying to create a highly google-able resource.

## This guide is specific to the Via Rail Corridor

Approximately 98% of Via Rail's passengers travel in the **Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor**. This guide is for those people, and may not be relevant to passengers on other services.

If you are travelling outside that zone (e.g. between Winnipeg and Thompson), or if you are travelling on an overnight train (e.g. between Montreal and Moncton), this guide is not for you.

This information is also not relevant to passengers on **the Maple Leaf** or **the Adirondack**. (Between New York City and Toronto/Montreal.) These trains run on Amtrak equipment and follow Amtrack policies and procedures, so this guide is not for you.

-----

# Booking Your Trip

## Fare Types

In the Corridor, you'll find two classes of service:

* **Economy**, which offers an assigned seat with fairly generous legroom, and a luggage allowance. You may bring your own food and non-alcoholic beverages aboard the train, or you may [purchase food and drink off the trolley](https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/menus/111137761-1_VIA_5633-15_Menus_Corridor_Cosmetique.pdf) using a credit or debit card.
* **Business**, which offers a few perks: a hot meal, free beverages (including alcohol after mid-morning), a larger luggage allowance, and use of the lounges at the major stations. (Where you'll find coffee, soft drinks, and comfortable places to sit.)

This is the only distinction which matters to most passengers: if you have firm travel plans, you can ignore the ""Plus"", ""Escape"", etc. stuff and book the cheapest fare in your chosen class.

If you need more flexibility (you may need to cancel or reschedule your booking), you should carefully consider the various options. (Plus, Escape, etc.)

### Is Business Class Worth it?

The price of Business Class can fluctuate significantly, and its value also varies between passengers:

* The hot meal is worth about $20 to me.
* If you drink, you'll probably get about $15-20 worth of alcohol during your trip. If you don't drink, let's call it $6 of soft drinks and snacks.
* The additional baggage allowance is worth about $20 *if you actually use it*.
* Lounge access is worth as much as you're willing to pay for it. (A coffee, a soft drink, a nice place to wait. Some people will say $0, some will say $5, some might say $10, totally up to you.)
* The broadly ""nicer"" situation aboard the train (a little more legroom, solo seats along one side of the train, etc.) is, likewise, worth as much as you're willing to pay for it.

To me, $30 for an upgrade to Business Class is a no-brainer. $50 is a splurge, $80 is a treat, and $100 is unjustifiable.

Your figures will vary.

-----

## Discounts

Via Rail uses airline-style pricing, where fares increase as trains fill up. This means that waiting for a discount is often a fool's game: given the choice between paying $80 today, or waiting for a 10% discount on a fare which has risen to $120, you should just pay today.

However, [you should absolutely check whether you qualify for any permanent discounts](https://www.viarail.ca/en/offers/deals-discounts), such as the CAA discount, the Indigenous discount, or the Military discount. You may also be eligible for discounts through your employer, you union, your university or college alumni association, etc., but you'll have to refer to them for more information.

-----

## How To Book

If you have simple needs (1-2 tickets, no special luggage, no special requirements), book online.

If you have more complex needs, call **1-888-842-7245** during business hours to speak with an agent. This can be especially helpful if you are travelling in a group of 3+, as the telephone agent may be able to set up special seating arrangements for you. Parents travelling with children can also request a special activity pack through the telephone service, and the telephone agents can also answer questions about accessibility requirements, dietary needs, etc.

-----

## Best Time To Travel / How To Save Money

Via's trains are quietest (and, therefore, cheapest) midweek and midday.

Via's trains are busiest in the mornings and evenings, especially on Fridays, Sundays and Mondays.

Trains around public holidays and university reading weeks can be especially busy: book *very* early if you want to travel around Christmas, Easter, etc.

-----

## Travelling With Children

If you have stroller-aged children, [you should read the baggage policy supplement about infants and toddlers](https://www.viarail.ca/en/plan/baggages/toddlers-infants).

Via Rail does not have seatbelts, and does not require car seats or other fixtures. (But if you'd like a booster seat, you're welcome to bring one aboard.)

Consider booking seats with a table. Many cars have 2-3 table positions, and this is often more comfortable for families, especially if you are travelling with 3-4 people.

Via also offers activity packs for children who are colouring-book-aged. Speak with the reservation line (1-888-842-7245) to ask that the crew pack one for you. 

-----
-----
-----

# Before You Board

## Luggage

**In the Corridor, ALL luggage is carry-on luggage, even if it is a size that you would normally check at the airport.** If you are travelling in the Corridor, you may ignore all advice and instructions about checked baggage: it does not exist for you.

For more information on your baggage allowance, [refer to Via Rail's website](https://www.viarail.ca/en/plan/baggages/carry-baggage).

Parents travelling with **stroller-aged children** should [also check out Via Rail's policy on toddler and infant baggage](https://www.viarail.ca/en/plan/baggages/toddlers-infants), which offers several significant advantages. (And note that Via's staff are not usually in the practice of actually measuring strollers.)

-----

## Food and Drink

You are welcome to bring your own food and non-alcoholic beverages aboard the train. ([Food is available for purchase in Economy, but it can be expensive.](https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/menus/111137761-1_VIA_5633-15_Menus_Corridor_Cosmetique.pdf)) Your cabin attendant will provide hot and cold tap water upon request, and can also warm up baby food in the car's microwave.

Passengers travelling in Business Class will be served a hot meal, with beverage service. You are still welcome to bring additional food and drink if you like.

If you are travelling in Business and you have dietary needs, Via has a [special meal program](https://www.viarail.ca/en/plan/specific-needs#special-meals-and-allergies), provided you let them know at least two days before your trip. If you book online, you can request a special meal through that process. If you need to add a special meal to an existing booking, call 1-888-842-7245.

-----

## How Early Do I Need To Be At The Station?

For your very first trip out of **Toronto Union Station**, you should arrive at least 30 minutes before your train departs. This station is massive and confusing, so give yourself a cushion.

For your very first trip out of **Montreal Gare Centrale**, you should arrive at least 20 minutes before your train departs.

For your very first trip out of **any other station**, 10 minutes should be enough time for you to to catch your train. If you use a wheelchair or will be travelling with a lot of luggage or young children, consider allowing 15 minutes.

-----

## Will My Train Be Late?

Maybe! Via Rail's on-time performance is about 60%; for context, Air Canada runs about 70%. So, yes, there is a real chance your train will be late.

**IMPORTANT**: while you can [follow your train's progress on the Via Rail website](https://tsimobile.viarail.ca/), note that a delayed train will often try to catch up to its schedule. This can get you in trouble. (For example, suppose you are catching a Toronto ‚û°Ô∏è Montreal train at Kingston, and when you check, you see your train is running 30 minutes late. You decide to delay your trip to the station by 30 minutes. But during the lull, the train picks up the pace, and runs through Kingston only 10 minutes late -- meaning you just missed your train!) Even if you see a significant delay, keep checking, and give yourself a cushion, just in case.

It is unusual for Corridor trains to be more than about 90 minutes late, but it does happen.

If you purchased a Via Rail ticket which has a connection, and you miss the connection due to a delayed train, Via is responsible for getting you to your destination. You must speak with train or station staff for more information.

If you miss a connection to another service (like a GO train or a flight out of Dorval airport), you are on your own. Give yourself *plenty* of time to make these connections.

If your train is significantly delayed, [you may be entitled to a travel credit which you can apply to a future booking](https://www.viarail.ca/en/plan/refunds-and-exchanges/travel-credits). You may also be able to convert this credit into Via Preference points, although the exchange rate can be unfavourable.

## Any Tips for Toronto Union Station?

The easiest way to navigate Union Station is to use [the main street-level entrance on Front Street](https://cdn.skyrisecities.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/2016/09/22521/22521-78267.jpg). These entrances lead to [the Great Hall](https://torontounion.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SpringMorrisPhoto_UnionStation_April_Outdoor__32A7537-scaled.jpg), which is right beside [the ramp down to the VIA trains](https://www.torontojourney416.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/union-station-2021-3-768x1024.jpg). This route keeps you off of all the staircases and elevators: once you know it, you can go from a taxi to a train in less than 5 minutes.

Union Station has a pretty solid food court, but if you'd like something a little more interesting, check out their Foodie Aisle, which has a more diverse offering for about the same price.

If you are travelling with young people who enjoy trains, and you have at least 45 minutes, consider following the signs for the CN Tower, which will lead you to a pedestrian bridge over the tracks, where you can watch the traffic entering and leaving Canada's busiest station. If you have a little more time, keep following the signs, and you'll reach [Roundhouse Park](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49969213092_d8ddcfc349_b.jpg), which is home to several heritage trains and railway structures.

-----

## Any Tips for Ottawa Station?

If you have at least 45 minutes and the O-Train is actually running, note that the St. Laurent mall is just one stop away by subway. Among other things, St. Laurent has a big dollar store right by the subway entrance, where you can pick up whatever you may need for the trip. (Snacks, drinks, colouring books, sunglasses, phone cables...)

-----

## Any Tips for Montreal Gare Centrale?

If you're travelling during the week, and it's at least lunchtime, bypass the McDonalds and hit up Pizza Pasta Mangione. It costs about the same, and you'll feel better about it.

# Boarding the Train

## Boarding at a Major Station (Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa)

Passengers will begin queuing up 30-45 minutes before boarding begins. **This is both optional and silly**: every passenger has an assigned seat, and there is plenty of space for luggage, so there's really no point in standing in line. You may as well stay seated until the line begins to run down.

Once you are at the front of the line, a station attendant will scan your boarding pass. They may also weigh and examine your luggage. Then will then direct you to your platform.

On the platform, a station attendant will direct you to your train car. At Toronto or Ottawa, you may have to take 3-4 steps up to enter the train, carrying your luggage with you.

Aboard the train, you will walk through the galley, then stop at the luggage rack. Put any large items here: there are overhead bins by your seat for backpack-sized objects and essential personal stuff.

Find your seat, sit down, and get ready to go.

## Boarding at Other Stations

At the very smallest stations, you can expect to find a bench, and that's about all. The train will pull up, you'll step aboard, and that's your lot.

At a larger station, you can expect to find a waiting area, but there may not be the same kind of gate-to-train service you'd get in Ottawa or Montreal. (An announcement will be made, doors may be held open, but beyond that you're kind of on your own.)

This makes it especially important that you monitor your train's progress and be ready to hop aboard when it arrives.

-----
-----
-----

# Aboard the Train

## Getting Underway

Shortly after you board, a train attendant will come by to check your tickets one last time, and confirm that you're in the right seat. If you would like to change to another seat (for example, so your family can share a table), this is the time to ask.

Once you are underway, the train's crew will announce all stops, and will also provide what information they have about your journey. (Delays, travel advisories, etc.)

-----

## Wifi, Electronics, and Working on the Train

All seats on the Corridor trains have standard 3-prong North American outlets.

While all of the Corridor trains have wifi, the oldest trains have notoriously slow and spotty coverage. (The newest trains are night-and-day better.)

Most seats on the Corridor have [airline-style tray tables](https://www.thislifeintrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4525-1024x768.jpg), which are highly suitable to laptops. Some seats also have [full tables](https://travel-dealz.de/app/uploads/sites/2/Via-Rail-Toronto-Ottawa-Sitze-Tisch-1100x743.jpg), which work very well. However, [some of the older cars have awkward mini-trays which stow in the armrest](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c6e173d93a632421bad3298/1603981652972-YIJCENYQ3FKOLXJD36IO/VIARailSeat), and these are no good for working on.

-----

## Access to Luggage

You will have access to your luggage during your trip, but you may find it inconvenient to open and repack a large suitcase on the floor in a train aisle. Try to pack your daily essentials in a backpack, purse, or tote bag, which you can keep at your seat.",15,1746462056.0,ViaRail,4,1.0,False

1kffqqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kffqqi/explore_if_purewell_k8012_countertop_water_filter/,Explore if Purewell K8012 Countertop Water Filter Delivers Superior Filtration Performance Review,"The Purewell K8012 Replacement Countertop Water Filters caught my attention as an upgrade to my previous filtration system. With a 3-stage composite purification technology and claimed compatibility with Berkey and ProOne filters, it seemed like a solid contender for better-tasting and safer drinking water. Here‚Äôs how it performed in my daily use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The physical build of this filter is both compact and functional, standing at 8.6 inches tall with a diameter of 2.7 inches. It easily fits in my existing countertop filtration system without any weird adjustments needed, thanks to its well-thought-out design. The matte black finish gives it a sleek look, which honestly pairs better with my kitchen than I expected. Made from activated carbon, silver ion, and a hollow fiber UF membrane, the material quality feels sturdy, and the NSF/ANSI testing certifications gave me added confidence. However, the 1.32-pound weight of each unit surprised me‚Äîit's slightly bulkier than I thought it‚Äôd be when handling it during installation.

**Ease of Installation**  
Replacing the old filters in my system wasn‚Äôt a complicated affair. These Purewell filters slid right into place without any leakage due to their tight fit. I didn‚Äôt even have to dig up the manual. I do recommend giving them a rinse first (a step easily missed) to flush out excess carbon dust, which is common with filters like this. Once installed, no odd smells or tastes appeared in the water‚Äîjust crisp, fresh hydration from the first glass.

**Performance and Filtration Power**  
With its advanced 3-stage filtration technology, the difference was noticeable. The hollow fiber UF membrane and silver ion barrier seemed to tackle chlorine effectively, removing even the slightest hints of residual chemical taste. The activated carbon element took care of rust and sediment, while the advertised ""0.01-micron ultra-fine pore size"" came in handy to filter out tiny particles. After a month of use, I‚Äôve seen a consistently steady flow rate without any clogging. Even my coffee and tea seem to taste better‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt realized how much of an impact the little impurities in my water had been having. 

**Highlights**  
- Efficient removal of up to 99.9% of chlorine and other impurities.  
- Smaller pore size (0.01 microns) than many other carbons, improving filtration precision.  
- Long filtering lifespan, with one pair lasting for up to 6,000 gallons.  
- Compatible with both Berkey and ProOne systems, making it a versatile replacement option.

[Check Purewell K8012 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b09nprgm4h/)

**Drawbacks**  
Despite its strengths, there are a few potential downsides worth mentioning.  
- Initial slow water output during the first couple of uses after installation could frustrate some users.  
- The unit doesn‚Äôt reduce TDS levels (important if that‚Äôs a focus for your home filtration).  
- Slightly heavier than comparable filters, which doesn‚Äôt matter day-to-day but can be annoying during installation.  
- Filters may require frequent rinsing in areas with high sediment levels.

**Direct Competitors**  
Having used Berkey filters previously, I can confidently say that the Purewell units give them a run for their money. Berkey‚Äôs standard black elements are good but tend to clog faster, especially with unfiltered well water. The ProOne filters are another solid choice; however, their pore size is larger (0.2 microns), making them slightly less efficient at capturing tiny particles. What sets the Purewell apart is its long lifespan and precise filtration combined with compatibility with more systems while maintaining high water flow rates. I haven‚Äôt yet used it for the full 6,000 gallons, but based on existing performance, I feel it could see me through quite a few months before replacement becomes necessary.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The cost-effectiveness of the Purewell filters stands out, especially when considering their compatibility with industry titans like Berkey and ProOne. While they‚Äôre not revolutionary in terms of filtration compared to premium units, the affordability and versatility make them an excellent investment for households focused on safe, clean water at a reasonable price. Having two units in the pack helps justify the cost further, especially given their extended replacement cycle.

Went to school‚Äî4 hours of constant dread, tolerating the most mundane tasks while side-eyeing the clock after every second. Had an exam, trivial matters. What‚Äôs ironic is: why do we engage in activities where the main reason to go is to leave? Hasty, almost with a tired excitement.



After school, I went to the cafe, same spot, my sanctuary,

Where almost all my ideas are born and written. A sweet home for existential dread, where the smell of coffee reigns and the smoker's cloud drifts. I went there tired after a long week filled with exams I barely studied for. I had one last test‚Äîit was math, a subject very dear to me.

Perhaps... perhaps my eyes gave up. Heavy, exhausted from staring at screens late into the night, reading prompts about philosophy. My brain‚Äîmy best friend, my everything‚Äîfailed me.



Disappointed, I left my war luggage at the caf√©.

My pen, the scalpel that dissects my emotions; the agenda where the blood flows with no judgment or fear from being taxed by spelling mistakes or grammar. I went to take a nap on the grass next to the sidewalk near the busy traffic. I landed with a loud thud on the surface, a resignation to my fate. I fell asleep under the watchful gaze of the passers-by, wondering what this odd piece of meat is doing here‚Äîor perhaps what happened to the knight, shiny and bright once, now reduced to this miserable state. But perhaps, perhaps I trusted the sky to watch over me for once.



After a long while, I woke up, stretching under the warm sun,

Forgetting the weight of existence for once. I opened my eyes and saw cars racing against time. Then a thought crossed my mind‚Äîsuicide. I contemplated it for a moment: to crawl lazily toward where the cars are and lay down in silent sight. Instead, I just laughed and bought some random snacks. Went back to my beloved sanctuary with newfound energy‚Äîbut perhaps, perhaps, as soon as I said it, my hopes evaporated like the morning mist. I sat down in silence, contemplating defeat, counting the dead stars of my dreams.



I packed my belongings, almost reluctantly.

The despair was intense, my body shook, hiding my tears. I walked, each step heavier, carrying a crushing weight unbearable for me alone. Being alive was too much. I sat under a tree near the road, my fingers shaking, desperately longing for some comfort. I bit them to make them feel something. Refusing to go home, not falling for the illusion of fake comfort, knowing very well that under a blanket, I would freeze anyways. So instead, I searched desperately for comfort around me‚Äînature, but in vain. The only answer I got was the freezing gust of air, trying to freeze what‚Äôs not already frozen by dread. The trunk of the tree, my only support, was digging into my back, trying to scratch away the crumbs of hope I had left.



I stood, wished my farewells to the cursed place,

And retreated to my chambers, hoping the blanket would be more welcoming...",1,1746461914.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False
1kffp6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kffp6g/explore_the_kolcraft_cloud_umbrella_stroller/,Explore the Kolcraft Cloud Umbrella Stroller review: Is this lightweight option worth it?,"**A Hands-On Experience with the Kolcraft KU022-BLK1 Cloud Umbrella Stroller**

I recently got my hands on the Kolcraft KU022-BLK1 Cloud Umbrella Stroller, and testing it has been quite the adventure. Designed with a focus on convenience and practicality, it‚Äôs tailored for parents like me who value portability and compact design without sacrificing functionality. The lightweight aspect (just 9.5 lbs!) immediately caught my attention since lugging around heavier strollers during family outings can be quite the hassle. This stroller claims to simplify travel, and I‚Äôve been putting that to the test during daily errands, park visits, and brief travel escapades.

**Lightweight Build for Easy Mobility**  
Carrying lightweight, portable strollers often feels like lifting bricks, but not this time. Weighing a mere 9.5 pounds, this stroller feels like a breeze to maneuver around. Its compact, one-step fold design is genuinely useful when juggling a diaper bag, toddler, and coffee cup (we‚Äôve all been there). I've often folded and carried it with just one hand while navigating through narrow restaurant aisles or crowded parking lots, and the difference has been remarkable. Plus, its folded dimensions (10"" W x 9.5"" D x 42.5"" H) make it incredibly easy to stow in my car trunk.

**Sun Canopy That Goes the Extra Mile**  
One feature that stands out is the large sun canopy with a rear hood. Living in a sunny state, UV protection is non-negotiable. My little one stayed well-shaded during park strolls, thanks to the extended design that offers considerably more coverage compared to other lightweight strollers. I‚Äôve tried rolling up the mesh backing for ventilation during warmer days, which gives excellent breathability and doubles as an adjustable headrest. My child seemed happier and less fussy, likely due to the added comfort.

**Shock-Absorbing Wheels and Smooth Steering**  
Navigating bumpy pathways or uneven terrain is a nightmare for most lightweight strollers, but the shock-absorbing front swivel wheels on this one performed better than expected. While it‚Äôs not intended for hardcore jogging in rocky terrains, casual walks along gravel or slightly uneven sidewalks proved less of a bother. Foam-padded handles help ensure smooth control, even when rushing through a grocery store on a busy morning. Steering is intuitive and responsive, though sharp turns may require more input compared to pricier stroller models.

**Roomy Storage Despite Compact Form**  
The built-in storage basket is an underrated hero of this product. I was pleasantly surprised when it fit my toddler‚Äôs snacks, toys, and my compact diaper bag without struggling. There‚Äôs also a parent cup holder that‚Äôs been my lifesaver! It securely holds my iced latte during morning walks, sparing me the frustration of juggling items.

**Merits of This Umbrella Stroller**  
- Lightweight and ideal for travel (only 9.5 lbs).  
- Extended sun canopy with UV protection.  
- Shock-absorbing wheels improve ride comfort.  
- Compact folding mechanism for easy storage.  
- Ample storage and thoughtful extras, like a cup holder.  

**Limitations Worth Mentioning**  
Not everything is sunshine and smiles with this stroller, though. A few areas could use some polish:  
- The 3-point harness lacks the snug security of a 5-point harness, so I‚Äôd watch out for wiggly toddlers.  
- Its weight limit of 40 pounds means it might not suit larger or older kids.  
- Handles aren‚Äôt adjustable, which could be inconvenient for taller parents (like my over-six-foot husband).  

**Competing Products in the Market**  
When stacking the Kolcraft Cloud Umbrella Stroller against competitors like the Summer Infant 3Dlite Convenience Stroller, a few differences stood out. The Kolcraft excels in its exceptional portability and canopy size, but the Summer Infant model offers a sturdier build with a 5-point harness. Similarly, the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 has a sleeker appearance and comes with an adjustable calf support that outshines what this model offers. That said, both alternatives are heavier, and the Kolcraft does well when focusing solely on travel rankings.

**Value Proposition and Investment Perspective**  
If value for money is what you prioritize, this stroller undoubtedly delivers in spades. Stylish options aside, its portability, reasonably solid features, and comfort-oriented design make it a budget-friendly contender for everyday use or travel scenarios. It‚Äôs not a premium option, but it delivers excellent utility without emptying your wallet. Would I recommend it? Yes, particularly to parents keen on achieving the balance between affordability and functionality.

Maybe I've been so lost concentrating on you that I stopped seeing the world around me. The funny thing is my dreams have returned with avengeance. Cute choice of words I know, but it is the truth. What words we choose matter. What we do matters. A line from the song in Cats is running through my head. A fatalistic warning. But the point of the song, you remember, is in the next line. Another day is dawning. 

I think in idioms. It happens at our age. Fake it till ya make it. You've stopped even faking it. Maybe you think you've made it but you haven't. It don't mean a thing if you ain't got love. 

I know. I think in songs too. But sometimes it's easier to use someone else's words than to struggle to say what someone else has already said so eloquently. There are only so many ways to say I love you without sounding trite. Of course, I'd love to say I love you to you but I can't. I'd say it a million times if I could. I'd say it in the way I held your hand. In the way I poured your coffee in the morning and your g&t's at night. My every glance, every breath would scream it to the highest hosts of heaven and the deepest demons in hell. No force in this world or any other could force me to leave you once we've been bound physically. We've been bound spiritually for so long that I understand the meaning of the line what God has join no man can tear asunder. That is what I feel like every day without you. Torn asunder.

Was it no wonder I could not see the light in others when it has been banished in myself? Without you there is no light. Only pain, darkness and grief. If only you could shine your light on me.

Friends are silver, but love is gold. Isn't that the old saying? I'd even settle for sterling at this point. I look better in grey. Yellow washes me out. I'd never make a beautiful anything, but especially not a bride in white. It clashes with me. I deserve the stigma or maybe the Stigmata as autocorrect tried to tell me. Punishment seems about right.
