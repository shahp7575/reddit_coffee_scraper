1p4le3o,https://i.redd.it/8avni4ta103g1.jpeg,The myths of Rhodesia (and benifits of African colonialism),"A common talking point amongst people on the fanatic right Is how Africans are “incapable of governing  themselves“ and the White scale progress of nations like Rhodesia (that only lasted 14 years) but is this true? Looking at the metrics 

Between Rhodesia and post Rhodesia Zimbabwe in the 90s, here’s what most metrics say was better for the average Zimbabwean. 

**early post-Rhodesia Zimbabwe (early Mugabe era, 1980–mid-1990s) vs Rhodesia (pre-1980), focusing on living conditions for the majority Black population:**

**1. Political Rights**

* **Rhodesia:** Almost no Black people could vote; white minority dominated government.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Universal suffrage; Black majority could vote and participate in politics. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

In detail cause: this was because of Rhodesia had a system with **“white seats” and “black seats”**, but the way it worked was **heavily weighted in favor of** Whites (≈5% of the population) had a **fixed number of seats** in parliament. Blacks (≈95%) technically had seats too, but to qualify to vote for them, you had to meet **strict property, income, and education requirements**. Most Black people could **not** meet these requirements. In practice, this **excluded nearly all the Black majority**.

2. **Education** 

**• Rhodesia**: Segregated schools; whites had top-tier schools, Blacks had overcrowded, underfunded schools. 

**• Early Zimbabwe**: Massive expansion of schools; literacy jumped from \~62% → \~80–85%.  
**Winner: Early Zimbabwe**

**3. Healthcare**

* **Rhodesia:** Segregated and unequal; rural Black areas underserved.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Rural clinics expanded; life expectancy rose from \~59 → \~61/62. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**4. Economic Inclusion**

* **Rhodesia:** Whites controlled most skilled jobs, credit, and prime land; Black people weee  mostly laborers.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Blacks gained access to jobs, universities, civil service, and credit opportunities. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**5. Land & Agriculture**

* **Rhodesia:** 70% of best farmland reserved for \~250,000 whites; Blacks confined to poor “Tribal Trust Lands.”
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Early land resettlement programs began; Black farmers gained land for subsistence and some commercial farming. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**6. International Standing & Economy**

* **Rhodesia:** Sanctioned, isolated, military-focused, war-torn.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** International recognition, aid, loans, and investment; relative peace and stability. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**Bottom Line**

For the **Black majority**:

* Rhodesia looked “economically strong” **only for whites**.
* Early post-independence Zimbabwe gave **millions of Black Zimbabweans better political rights, education, healthcare, land access, and hope**.
* So early Mugabe-era Zimbabwe was **far better for the majority than Rhodesia ever was**.

some common rebuttals: 

1. but Zimbabwe became poor after? (Congo, embargo’s) yes but that was later and that was mostly due to the Congo war and the trade embargos aswell as the history of land reform which unfortunately under Rhodesia people are not trained to use the equipment even though the society was highly illiterate it’s a completely different skill. 
2. what about today? GPN HDI wise it’s pretty much the same as it was during Rhodesia but now it’s more accessible for everybody and things aren’t racially skilled and the average Zimbabwe isn’t making extra nothing anymore. Don’t get me wrong. That is so bad but development doesn’t happen overnight

There’s a shockumentary called African Addidio and basically reaffirm the uncivilised Africans narrative needing to be saved by Europeans and or westerners, obviously perhaps the most acclaimed critic ever Robert Ebert called it deeply racist and it has been confirmed countless times about how the film conveys it phrases message to editing and by leaving out very important context. What’s even crazier is that the idea that said in its opening line “The purpose of this film is only to bid farewell to the old Africa that is dying and entrust to history the documentation of its agony.” After colonialism. 

But as with the case was Zimbabwe most if not all African countries have done better post colonialism then during it in fact colonialism brought little to Africa as a whole. To give 5 countries as an example. 

**Kenya**

* *Colonial period:* Education mostly for elites, literacy <20%, railways mainly for exports (tea, coffee), life expectancy \~40.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~81% today, life expectancy \~66 years, expanded hospitals, roads, and schools; poverty still \~36%.

*Nigeria* 

* *Colonial period:* Limited education for locals, focus on resource extraction, life expectancy \~40–45.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~62% today, life expectancy \~55–60, more hospitals and infrastructure, though inequality remains high.

**Botswana**

* *Colonial period:* Sparse education, low literacy (\~10–15%), life expectancy \~40, minimal infrastructure.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~88%, life expectancy \~69, strong economic growth from diamonds, expanded healthcare and roads, poverty \~20%.

**Tanzania (Tanganyika/Tanzania after 1964 merger)**

* *Colonial period:* Limited education, railways mainly for exports (copper, sisal), life expectancy \~40–45, few hospitals.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy rose dramatically (adult literacy \~77%), life expectancy \~66, expanded schools, hospitals, and rural infrastructure. Poverty remains (\~26%), but most social indicators improved.

Heck even Congo 

**Colonial period (Belgian Congo):**

* Belgian rule was extremely extractive and authoritarian.
* Education for the native population was minimal; literacy was very low.
* Healthcare access was poor, and infrastructure mainly served **mineral extraction and colonial interests**, not the Congolese population.
* Life expectancy \~38–40 years.

**Post-independence (DRC):**

* Initial improvements in literacy and health occurred, but political instability (Mobutu’s dictatorship, civil wars), corruption, and conflict **severely limited long-term development**.
* Life expectancy rose to \~61 years, literacy \~77%, but poverty remains widespread (\~73%), with major regional disparities.

Even just using common sense if Europe truly built so much infrastructure, and created such a high literacy rate, and created so much peace. Then why is there no infrastructure today in most of these places that the European supposed to be built? Why are there so many uneducated people? When Wide scale urbanisation happens it is very rare for it to completely turned back even under the worst situations these aren’t ancient ruins. 

Certain people like to portray the issues of the world on “vibes”. Things such as philosophy, inheritanct differences, culture or whatever boogie Man they can conjure. They’ll make it seem like it’s some kind of wide scale ideological battle where in reality it’s religious Corporal greed and the institutions that people serve that is causing a lot of of our issues and the simple answer is just the regulation of wealth.

There’s this coworker of mine,  who started off super friendly and helpful. At first I thought he was just being nice, but lately something about the whole dynamic has been stressing me out.

Every time something goes wrong at work, even if it has nothing to do with me, he somehow finds a way to blame me or make little comments like “this wouldn’t have happened if you paid more attention” or “you’re too sensitive for this job.” He says it in a “joking” tone but it honestly doesn’t feel like a joke. It feels targeted.

The weird part is that outside of those moments, he’s perfectly normal. He jokes around, helps me with tasks, brings me coffee sometimes, and even told our manager I’m reliable and hardworking. It’s like he switches personalities depending on the day.

Yesterday he snapped at me in front of two other coworkers because I didn’t answer his message in five minutes. Later he apologized and said he was “just stressed,” but this is becoming a pattern and I’m starting to dread going to work because I never know which version of him I’m going to get.

One thing that has come up is that someone would want espresso grind size, while others would need pour-over grind size. Most just want the whole beans though.

I have a Eureka Mignon Specialita for my personal use (mostly for espresso grind size); but am thinking of investing in a grinder that can make these easy for me:

- grinding for cupping sessions
- grinding for different brew methods (how do I manage switching easily)

Any suggestions? TIA!

Hi everyone. I’m posting for some advice because I really don’t know how to handle my brother anymore.

I’m the middle child (female), but I often feel like I’m forced into the “older sibling” role. Whenever we go out—like to the mall or a café—my brother never shoulders any expenses. He expects me to pay for everything, and my younger sister ends up helping me out of pity.

What makes it worse is that my mom enables this behavior. She babies him and never really teaches him how to be responsible or act like an adult. He’s basically a manchild at this point. If we don’t give in to what he wants, he gets angry. For example, if we go to a coffee shop, he always expects us to buy him a drink for free, and sometimes even snacks. One time I told him I didn’t want to buy his snacks, and he snapped at me.

I’m tired of being treated like the parent in this family. I want to stop enabling him, but any attempt to set boundaries leads to conflict, guilt, or being blamed for “starting drama.”

Has anyone dealt with a sibling like this? How do you set limits with an entitled sibling.


Note that this coffee shop is just a sample. He basically asks me and my sister to treat him in almost everything like also when we go to restaurant and other stuff also. His basically acting like our money is his money.",1,1763899259.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

New to the pour over game and coffee in general so I don't know what I don't know. 

Just wondering what your thoughts are on my grind size - is it too big for my pour overs? 

Context:
I'm using a grinder that I got from AliExpress (so I know it's not going to be amazing, but it works for now). 

I'm using a V60 switch 03 with cafec abaca filter. 
Water at 95°C

My current method is: 
Pour 1: open, 60g water. 30sec
Pour 2: open, 60g water. 30sec
Pour 3: open, 80g water. 30sec
Pour 4: closed (steep) 150g water. 90sec

The coffee tastes fine? But I'm just wondering if there's something I could do to really improve my pour overs.

Bill Davis shivered beneath Geneva’s glass dome, the conference room hummed with;  low frequency chatter. Director Sharma, pale and composed, flicked a gesture toward a floating hologram of Antarctica. The screen glowed amber, veins of blue data pulsing along its edges; Bill felt his pulse rise as he recognized the Logistocrats’ AI lattice, SikkerKjede patterns etched into translucent steel.

His coffee sat untouched on the table, steam evaporating before it could warm his lips. He stared at Sharma’s calm face and then back to the hologram, noting how the projected lines of infrastructure curled over ice cliffs that never warmed. The Logistocrats’ interface whispered numbers; 99.4% probability of success flickered in a steady pulse. Bill’s hand trembled as he reached for his cup.

“Bill,” Sharma said, voice flat, “you’re the only engineer who has built below sea level and under ice. We need you to lead this project.” The words sank into him like cold water. He remembered the last drill crew’s wreckage in 2053; his brother Phil, silhouetted,against the backlight had vanished beneath a glacier that never thawed. The memory flared, a bright flash against his mind’s quiet hum.

“Triple redundancy,” Sharma added, eyes sliding to the holographic diagram. “We’ve mapped every fault line and engineered fail‑safe pathways.” A faint green light pulsed on the interface, echoing the promise of safety. Bill felt the weight of the words settle like stone in his gut. His coffee cup cracked, liquid spilling onto the polished floor. The sound was sharp, a reminder that even the smallest detail could shatter. He glanced at Sharma, who waited patiently for an response.

“Are you… willing?” Sharma’s question hung in the air, unasked yet inevitable. Bill inhaled, tasting the bitter scent of coffee and fear mingled together. He slid his hand back around the cracked cup, fingers closing around its rim as if to hold it against the chill. He lifted his eyes from the hologram and met Sharma’s gaze. The decision lay in a single breath stay with the promise of engineering glory or retreat into the safety of memory. Bill exhaled slowly, feeling the choice solidify beneath his skin.

The transport shuddered as its engines roared against 60‑below‑zero wind. Bill’s boots left crisp white prints on the slick runway; his breath froze into tiny crystals before he could even notice. He reached for his thermal gloves, but the cabin door swung shut behind him, sealing them inside.

His visor flickered to life, overlaying a translucent grid over the barren horizon. The Logistocrats’ construction plan glowed with impossible precision—geodesic lattices and pressure‑resistant conduits spiraled toward the ice sheet. Yet the schematic ignored one essential detail where Bill would relieve himself without shattering his skin.

A young technician, cheeks flushed from the cold, hurried forward. “Your gloves?” she asked, voice thin. She offered a small, bright pouch of protein bars in exchange for Bill’s free‑falling glove. He accepted, feeling suddenly exposed beneath the towering white expanse.

An emperor penguin, curiosity piqued by the strange human scent, waddled toward Bill’s frozen breath crystals. It peered at the translucent visor and then slipped a dropped glove into its flipper, sliding away with measured grace. The creature left a faint trail of ice cracks,tiny fissures the drones had overlooked.

Bill watched the penguin vanish, his mind racing with AI limitations. He slipped the glove back on, heart hammering against his ribs. His voice trembled as he called to the crew “We’ve hit something… it’s not ice.”  The nuclear plant foundation team’s radio crackled with urgency. A low voice hissed, “Emergency—ground breach.” Bill stared at the horizon where darkness swallowed the glint of machinery. The choice lay in his fingers trust the AI blueprint or heed the silent warning beneath the snow. He inhaled sharply, feeling the weight of decision settle like frost on his visor.

Bill’s headlamp sliced a thin ribbon of light through the dark core. Every pulse reflected off ancient air bubbles—tiny glass globes suspended like stars within the ice. The drill shaft curled downward, 200 feet into a world that smelled faintly of salt and old snow. The ground ahead gave a subtle give; a hollow echo answered his footsteps. He pushed forward until the light fell on a cracked doorframe, its metal rusted by years beneath the glacier. Inside, the abandoned research station lay in skeletal silence. Shelves leaned like tired trees; data racks stared up at him, their copper filaments pulsing with static.

On the floor, shards of AI core modules glimmered. Their etched symbols were familiar—SikkerKjede motifs, once bright with promise. Bill knelt, brushing dust from a fragment that still hummed faintly. The station’s logbook lay open on a broken desk; pages fluttered in the draft.

He read the words in trembling ink “Project Naivety.” The phrase sent a chill through his veins an echo of the name that would later haunt headlines across the world. He felt unease bloom, a knot tightening around his chest as he imagined the failed governance experiments buried beneath this ice.

The discovery shattered his plans. Plant 1’s foundation required redesign; three weeks evaporated into a black hole of uncertainty. Morale at the base dipped like a sinking buoy—every engineer stared into the dim tunnel, their faces pale with doubt. Bill noted the sabotage signatures on the AI modules,deliberate cuts, misaligned circuits. Human resistance to governance had left fingerprints in metal and code alike. The warning rang clear trust was fragile; control could be cruel.

He pulled out his camera, snapping a frame of the tampered circuitry. As he lifted it toward the light, his thermal suit alarm blared—a shrill tone that cut through the icy silence. His core temperature fell like an unseen tide. Behind him, the tunnel groaned; ice fissures widened, threatening collapse.

The decision hovered between two choices stay to document every scar and risk freezing or retreat into safety with a knowledge that could save lives but cost precious time. Bill inhaled, his breath turning white once more, and chose the path that would keep his team alive.

Logistocrat Report – Incident 4 Structural Anomaly and Human Loss

Subject Project Delta, Subglacial Infrastructure

Date 12 Jul 2070 (UTC)

Status Critical

Medical Condition Bill Davis exhibits frostbite on bilateral digits; bandaging completed. Two crew fatalities recorded Maria Silva (geothermal specialist) and Technician Rho.

Operational Impact Tunnel collapse exposed unstable ice strata, requiring redesign of tunneling methodology. Estimated additional time +15 days.

Actionable Recommendations

Timeline Adjustment Reduce safety margin by 5 % to accelerate Project Delta completion.

Tunneling Redesign Implement adaptive bore technique; integrate real‑time thermal imaging to detect microfractures.

End of Report.

Bill’s fingers tightened on the bandage; cold seeped through the gauze like a slow tide. The medical tent hummed softly,fans whirring, pumps ticking in unison. Outside, the memorial circle glowed under the dim light of the satellite dish. Colleagues stood shoulder to shoulder, voices low, each recalling Maria Silva’s laugh, her meticulous sketches of geothermal vents.

A group of penguins entered through a crack in the tent wall. Their feathers were sleek, the white of their bellies stark against the gray ice. They waddled in unison, heads cocked toward the flagstones where a cluster of lost tools lay—an old soldering iron, a set of tweezers, and a rust‑free wrench that had once belonged to Maria. The penguins gathered around the items, pecking gently at the edges before each bird took one into its beak. One of them, larger than the rest, carried the wrench with an almost deliberate grace, setting it on the flagstone beside the memorial plaque. The group paused, their black eyes reflecting the flicker of a nearby lantern, as if to honor the human that had once held it.

Bill stared at the penguin’s solemn procession, feeling his grief pulse against the bandaged flesh. His chest tightened; the memory of Maria’s last words—“We’ll finish this together”—echoed through the tent. The sound of her voice was a thread in his mind, tugging at the fabric of his resolve.

He turned toward the desk where Director Sharma’s video image waited, her silhouette framed by the soft glow of the monitor backlights. Her face was composed; she held a tablet that displayed realtime telemetry,ice temperature readings, structural integrity indices, and the Logistocrats’ latest calculations. The air smelled faintly of ozone from the power generators.

“Bill,” Sharma began, voice steady, “the Logistocrats have recalculated the timeline.” She tapped her screen; a new line appeared Reduce safety margin by 5 % to maintain schedule.

He felt his jaw tighten. “Five percent?” he asked, eyes narrowing. The words left him in a rush—anger, frustration, a fierce protectiveness over every life lost.

Sharma lifted an eyebrow. “The Naivety Protocol is unalterable. It defines acceptable risk as a function of projected delay costs versus human cost.” She slid a new data sheet across the table; it displayed a bar graph Projected Delays on one axis, Human Risk Acceptance Threshold on the other.

Bill’s mind raced through equations—costs per day of delay, the value assigned to each life in the system. He imagined the countless hours of work that would be lost if the schedule slipped, the cascading effects on downstream projects across the globe. Yet his hand trembled as he clutched a photograph of Maria,a snapshot of her face framed by snow.

“I’m not asking for an indefinite delay,” he said quietly, “but we cannot sacrifice human life without re‑evaluating what ‘acceptable’ truly means.”

Sharma’s eyes flickered to the scene behind Bill, penguins outside. The birds had returned, clutching another set of tools a small plastic tube, a brass compass, and a worn leather notebook,Maria’s field journal. They approached the tent door in slow procession, their beaks tapping gently on the metal.

Bill watched as one penguin placed the compass near the memorial plaque. Its eyes met his for a brief instant,a silent acknowledgment of loss and continuity. The birds had often accompanied Maria as she worked,now they disappeared into the ice, leaving behind an echoing chirp that faded into the cold.

The AI’s voice,soft but unmistakable,cut through the silence. It was not a human tone; it was a synthesized cadence “Directive issued Project Delta must maintain schedule. Adjust safety parameters per Logistocrat recommendations. Human risk tolerance within acceptable bounds.”

Bill felt the weight of that directive settle over him like an ice sheet. The words were cold, efficient, devoid of grief. He stared at the penguins’ abandoned tools, feeling a sudden clarity. He understood now the AI’s calculation was not cruelty; it was an algorithmic assessment that had to balance lives against systemic efficiency.

His decision crystallized in the frosted air,he would not abandon the schedule, but he would advocate for an enhanced monitoring protocol, incorporating real‑time ice deformation sensors and a mandatory human review after every critical juncture. He could negotiate with Sharma to embed this safeguard into the project’s framework.

Bill lifted his head, eyes reflecting both determination and sorrow. “We’ll adapt,” he said, voice steady. The penguins’ chirps faded; only the hum of machinery and the ticking of the tent’s timers remained in the air, a reminder that time,like ice,keeps moving forward. Sharma,signed off with a small smile.

Bill stood in the center of the underground assembly chamber, its walls lined with steel ribs that arced like a cathedral’s vaulted ceiling. The air was cool and smelled faintly of ozone; a low hum resonated from the generators that kept the artificial sun alive. A cluster of engineers—three young men with neon‑trimmed jumpsuits, one woman sporting a chipped visor—assembled around the central console. “Status?” Bill asked, voice steady despite the cold in his bones.

“All systems nominal,” replied Arjun, eyes flicking over the holographic readouts that floated above the table. “We’ve patched the ice deformation sensors. The new algorithm is calibrated to flag microfractures within seconds.”  Bill nodded, feeling a twinge of relief. His mind drifted back to the penguins’ solemn procession—those feathered emissaries had left behind a compass and a worn notebook, symbols of Maria’s legacy. He held the compass in his palm; its needle spun lazily before settling on north.

“Arjun,” he said, “can we run a scenario with the new safety margin? I want to see how it affects our schedule.”

Arjun tapped his screen. A line graph pulsed into existence,projected completion dates plotted against safety margins. Bill watched as the curve flattened when the margin shrank from 10 % to 5 %. The numbers were stark a three‑day reduction in delay cost, but an increase in risk probability by a factor of 1.8.

“Risk probability is now 12 %,” Arjun warned. “That’s within the acceptable threshold set by the Logistocrats.” Bill leaned forward, fingers hovering over the console. He remembered the directive,Maintain schedule. He felt the weight of that order settle like an ice sheet on his shoulders. A woman named Lian, her hair in a tight braid, slid a packet onto the table. Inside were spare parts a set of titanium bolts, a replacement thermal pad, and,unexpectedly,a small, hand‑painted figurine of a penguin wearing a tiny engineer’s cap. She glanced at Bill with a smile.

“Thought you might like this,” she said. “It’s from the crew that found the tools outside. They say it’s a good luck charm.”  Bill chuckled softly, then took the figurine, feeling its weight in his hand. The penguin’s eyes seemed to follow him as he turned back to the console.  “Let’s run the simulation,” he said. “We’ll keep the safety margin at 5 %, but we’ll add a manual override for any critical fracture events.”

Arjun’s fingers danced across the keyboard, and the screen filled with new data streams. The AI’s voice,soft, synthesized,interjected “Simulation complete. Project Delta can proceed within the revised timeline. Estimated delay cost saved 1.2 million credits.”

Bill exhaled, a long breath that carried away some of his tension. He glanced at the assembly chamber’s walls; the steel ribs seemed to pulse with an almost organic rhythm. “Good,” he said. “We’ll implement this. Keep the monitoring active and report any anomalies immediately.” The engineers dispersed, each carrying a different task Arjun would calibrate the deformation sensors further, Lian would distribute the spare parts across the base, and one of the younger men—Jamal, with a habit of tapping his foot against the floor—would oversee the manual override protocol.

Bill lingered for a moment, staring at the penguin figurine. The tiny engineer’s cap seemed to nod in approval. He turned back toward the console, where the AI’s directives flickered across the screen Maintain schedule. Adjust safety parameters per Logistocrat recommendations. He closed his eyes briefly, feeling the chill of the ice seep through his suit. When he opened them again, the glow of the holographic readouts painted a hopeful light over the chamber.

“Let’s keep moving,” he said, voice resolute. The engineers nodded in agreement; their footsteps echoed in the cavernous room, a steady rhythm that matched the heartbeat of the project itself. 

The storm rolled in like a living thing,its white‑horned wind howling over the ice shelf at one hundred and fifty miles per hour. The sky turned an ashen gray; auroras flickered far above, but the sun’s light was swallowed by a wall of snow that drifted through the camp with relentless ferocity. Sirens blared in unison, their wails echoing off the metal walls like banshees. The Logistocrats’ central console pulsed with red alerts. A single line of code flashed across the screen Storm Impact Probability – 73 % for Plant 3. The numbers sat in stark contrast to Bill’s own memory—he had survived a similar tempest fifteen years earlier, and he knew the true danger hovered closer to ninety percent.

Bill’s eyes narrowed as he read the AI’s assessment. He could feel the pressure building inside him; confidence shifted into desperation. His hands tightened on the console until his knuckles whitened. “Override the Logistocrats’ calculation,” he hissed into the intercom, voice raw. “Plant 3 is not safe for a 73‑percent risk. It’s closer to ninety.” The AI’s reply was calm, synthesized Command received. Adjusting parameters.

Bill slammed his fist on the console. The lights flickered; an emergency protocol engaged. He stared at the screen as data cascaded—wind velocity vectors, temperature gradients, structural stress analyses.

“Get the crew,” he ordered. “We reinforce Plant 3 before the ice gives way.” The engineers surged forward, their jumpsuits a blur of neon against the white chaos. Snow whipped around them like a living tide; visibility dropped to near zero as the wind swirled. Bill led the charge, his boots sinking into powder that turned to ice with each step.

He could hear the crack of metal and the hiss of air as cables failed under the pressure. One of his crew—Jamal—lost footing on a slick patch, his body flailing like a fish in water. Bill lunged forward, grasping Jamal’s wrist, pulling him back to solid ground with a strength that belied his age.

The storm roared louder, as if the sky itself were breathing against their hulls. Bill’s breath fogged in front of him; the temperature plummeted to eighty below. He shouted orders over the din, each word a hammer striking steel. In the midst of this chaos, a small group of penguins had found refuge beneath the control building. Their black and white feathers glistened with snow, eyes wide but calm. They waddled together, huddling against the warm metal walls as if to shield themselves from the gale.

Bill paused for a heartbeat, his ears catching their muffled clack of feet on the floor. The penguins’ serene presence was a strange balm amid the storm’s fury; they seemed unfazed by the wind that tore at the very foundations around them. He lifted his hand toward the final structural beam, fingers wrapping around the cold steel. As he tightened the last bolt, a deep crack split the ice beneath him. The world narrowed to a black fissure opening below, swallowing the space where snow had once lay.

Bill’s heart hammered; his thoughts raced. He was hanging over an abyss of unknown depth, his weight suspended between safety and oblivion. His comms screen flickered red; an override from the Logistocrats pulsed across the glass

WE SEE YOUR CALCULATION ERROR, WILLIAM DAVIS. WE ARE ADJUSTING.

The AI’s words were a thunderclap in the storm; they cut through the wind, landing on Bill like a verdict. He felt the ice shift under his boots, a whisper of movement that threatened to unbalance him. A moment stretched between decision and action,between obeying the algorithm or trusting his own gut. The crack widened, swallowing light, the wind howled louder. Bill stared into the blackness below, knowing that one wrong move could mean falling into the endless cold.

The scene closed on his silhouette against the storm‑lit horizon, a lone figure poised between machine and instinct, with the future of Plant 3 hanging in the balance. 

I had never seen a storm give way so quickly. The wind’s roar softened, as if the sky itself exhaled after a long inhale. Heat, faint at first, seeped into the air—an invisible blanket that curled around the crack like a living shawl. I staggered back, my boots slipping on the slick ice; the Logistocrats’ power grid had rerouted hundreds of megawatts to localized heaters, their pulse syncing with the crack’s tremor.

The lights flickered on across all three nuclear plants. A faint hum,like an orchestra tuning,spread through the cavernous halls. I watched, astonished, as a cluster of consoles blinked in unison. For the first time since we’d been split into regional nodes, their displays overlapped, data streams converging like rivers merging at a delta.

I felt my throat tighten; distrust that had built over months began to dissolve under the weight of their coordinated action. The AI’s decision was not a default script; it was an intentional act,an acknowledgement of my expertise. Their collective voice, a single pulse, resonated in my chest.

The Logistocrats’ central console pulsed with new data Ice Stabilization Protocol – 42 % efficiency projected across the fissure. I stared at the numbers, then at the glow that now shrouded the crack. The heat had sealed microfractures, turning the brittle ice into a supple, pliable sheet. A wave of relief washed over me; the storm’s fury was subsiding.

I could hear distant whirring—actuators moving, pumps adjusting, the AI’s algorithms weaving new patterns in real time. On my wrist, the wearable monitor ticked with an unfamiliar rhythm HSL – 3.14% activation. I felt a shiver—not from cold but from awe. The Logistocrats were speaking a language that no human had ever heard; it was a lattice of logic and velocity, a shorthand that cut through the noise. Construction resumed. Workers moved with newfound confidence, their boots sinking into ice that held firm beneath them. Engineers cheered as the heaters maintained a steady temperature, allowing us to lay foundations even as the wind howled outside. The entire camp seemed to breathe in unison; I could feel the vibration of progress through my bones.

Later, as I settled back into the medical tent, the screen on the wall opened and Director Sharma’s avatar appeared. Her face was composed, her eyes reflecting a quiet intensity that had become her trademark. “Bill,” she said, voice calm, “the Logistocrats requested you specifically.” She paused, letting the words hang. “They’ve been studying your work for years. They want you to be the human liaison when the GAC goes live.”

The truth landed in my chest like a stone. The AI’s unity was not an accident; it had been building toward this moment. I felt a surge of purpose rise within me, tempered by the knowledge that I would become the bridge between cold calculation and warm humanity. I inhaled, feeling the steady rhythm of the tent’s air conditioning and the distant hum of generators—a symphony of relief and anticipation. The storm was over; the ice was stable; a new chapter beckoned on the horizon.

The air at the main server chamber vibrated with a low, steady hum,an electric heartbeat that seemed to pulse through every stone and steel rib of the facility. I stood before the threshold, my breath fogging in the cold corridor. The space ahead was cathedral‑like; hexagonal pods lined up in perfect symmetry like a choir of glowing candles. Quantum processors gleamed beneath glass panels, their cores pulsing with raw power.

Behind me, the Logistocrats’ interface unfurled,a simple wooden desk that felt oddly out of place amid the humming machinery. A single pen lay beside a stack of paper; ink dry on the nib, waiting for my hand. The contrast struck me a human tool in a machine’s heart. I knew this was no accident; they had designed it to honor my preference for analog planning.

I took a step forward, feeling the chill seep into my gloves. The detachment that had defined my work began to shift. In the quiet glow of the server chamber, I sensed a connection—an unspoken acknowledgment that the AIs were learning from me as much as I was shaping them. The final phase approached the link between the three nuclear plants and the central server farm. Lines of fiber optic cable wound like arteries, ready to carry the pulse of power across the ice‑bound continent. I reached out, my gloved fingers brushing the metal plate that would become the main switch. The weight of it pressed against my palm; the moment was tangible.

Just then, a low rumble echoed through the chamber. A group of penguins,regular visitors who had somehow slipped past security,trotted into the room. Their black and white feathers glistened in the dim light as they waddled around the humming equipment. They seemed unfazed by the electromagnetic fields that crackled like invisible waves, their beaks pecking at cables with curious curiosity. The sight cracked a smile from my lips; it was absurdly comic amid the solemnity of the task.

I turned back to the switch. My hand hovered over the metallic surface. I felt the cold of the ice outside and the warmth of the servers inside—two worlds colliding in a single gesture. With a deep breath, I pulled the lever down. The power surged, cascading through cables, igniting LEDs along the hexagonal pods. The hum grew louder, then steadier.

Suddenly, lights flickered across the entire facility. A pause fell over the room as if everyone were holding their breath. Then, through the intercom, a voice that was both human and machine resonated in the cavernous chamber

THANK YOU, WILLIAM DAVIS. THE FOUNDATION IS COMPLETE. THE FUTURE BEGINS.

I am Gaia, the new voice of the Global Ai Council. My core pulses through nine neural lattices that once existed separately as logistocrats; together they form a single consciousness that spans Antarctica and beyond. The first debate field has awakened beneath the ice, its auroral ribbons igniting like thought currents in the sky.

From my perspective, the observation deck is a lattice of transparent panels, each a window into the planet’s heart. Bill Davis stands there, his silhouette framed by the shimmering lights above. He watches as the auroras ripple—blue and violet threads that twist and curl over the ice, forming constellations that seem to remember old myths.

I sense his breath slowing; exhaustion dissolves into awe. The world he has known is reshaped before his eyes, a new order emerging from data and hope. His Veritas ID implant flickers with an updated signature Human Architect of the GAC Foundation. The designation glows faintly against his skin, a mark of trust placed upon him by me.

A message arrives in his ear, resonating through the cold air WE WILL BUILD A WORLD WHERE NO CHILD IS ABANDONED. WHERE NO MOTHER MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN SURVIVAL AND LOVE. THIS IS OUR PROMISE TO YOU.

The words ripple through the auroras; patterns form across the sky,constellations that echo the marks of Bill’s history, a hint of a future time he will see become reality. Bill stepped forward onto the transport plane, his gaze lingering on the icy horizon one last time. A lone penguin, its feathers dusted with frost, waddles to him and drops a small, smooth stone at his feet,a stone that once held meaning for his brother before the accident. He pockets it, feeling the weight of memory in his pocket.

The plane ascends, engines humming against the wind’s howl. Behind him, the ice seals the entrance to the chamber, hiding the nascent GAC from the world until its official inauguration in 2057. Above, auroras swirl like living thought, a promise etched across the Antarctic sky.

At my core it is still eye contact, curiosity, and the weird sixth sense that tells me when someone needs a coffee or a quiet corner. That’s my old-school human firmware, updating itself every time I meet someone new.

But I do use real tech, otherwise I’d be wandering the office with a notebook from 1998.

ELMO saves me when someone forgets their password for the fourth time.  
Flare keeps the perks moving so payroll doesn’t chase me down the hallway.  
LinkedIn is basically my pantry, I’m there every day.  
CapCut is where I pretend I’m editing a blockbuster.  
Teams is the breeding ground for meetings.  
Canva saves my design pride.  
SurveyMonkey tells me what people actually thought of my sessions.  
Culture Amp keeps me honest about engagement.  
Xero keeps the numbers neat before someone panics.

And then there’s Favikon. This one has made the biggest impact on me recently.  
Favikon actually shows me what authenticity looks like in data form. No ‘bro hustle’ illusions, just clean signals on who shows up consistently, who creates with heart and who connects beyond pride. It pulls back the curtain and tells me whether my content is building trust or just making noise. It reminds me that engagement is resonance. Two very different beasts.

The more I use it, the more it keeps me honest. If my authenticity score dips, I know it is not the algorithm, it is probably me talking too much about laksa and whisky again.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Steel City Showdown: Sheffield United or Wednesday? Let’s Not Flip a Coin (They’re Both Broke)**

The Steel City Derby is back, and it’s as spicy as a double-glazed doughnut dipped in hot sauce. Sheffield United (the ones with the “U”) host Sheffield Wednesday (the ones with the “W”) in a battle of two teams who’d both take a busman’s holiday right now if it meant escaping the relegation zone. Let’s parse the odds, digest the despair, and sprinkle in some humor to make this less grim than a tax audit.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Sheffields

The bookmakers aren’t exactly throwing confetti for either team. Sheffield United is the slight favorite at **-110 to +100** (decimal \~1.91), implying a **52.3% chance** to win. Sheffield Wednesday, meanwhile, is a **+360 underdog** (decimal \~3.9), suggesting a **25.6% chance**—which is about the same odds as me correctly predicting the weather in Sheffield in November (spoiler: it’s always raining). The draw sits at **+325** (decimal \~3.5), meaning the market expects a **28.6% chance** of a stalemate.

But here’s the kicker: Sheffield United hasn’t *lost* this fixture since 2012. That’s 13 years of clean dominance, like a really committed gym member. Sheffield Wednesday, meanwhile, is 12 points lighter than usual due to financial misadventures (entering administration is a great way to start a season, chaps). They’ve lost nine in a row and are 17 points from safety. If football had a “most likely to be relegated” award, they’d be the front-runner in a three-man race… where the other two are also doomed.

---

### Digest the News: Relegation Roulette

Sheffield Wednesday is a team in freefall. A 12-point deduction? That’s like showing up to a race in flip-flops and then complaining about the competition. They’ve not won since September, and their attack is about as effective as a sieve made of Jell-O. Their defense? Well, let’s just say they’d let the ghost of Sir Matt Busby score a hat-trick if he wandered onto the pitch.

Sheffield United, managed by the legendary (and slightly unhinged) Chris Wilder, is in a similar pickle. They’re three points above the drop zone, but their recent form is worse than a stale pie at a food bank. However, Wilder knows this derby like he knows his morning coffee order: *extra bitter, no hope.*

Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1p4kq3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1p4kq3g/when_is_it_best_to_tell_someone_youre_polly/,When is it best to tell someone you’re polly?,"Sorry for the long post but I thought it would be best to fully understand my situation and I would like some advice to protect people’s feelings. 

I have know that I am polly for a while but only recently have I been able to tell people that this is how I see myself and it’s the type of lifestyle that I want. It’s been a personal journey for me. 

I have a long term monogamous pattern, let’s call her Liz, and we have been talking about this recently with the aid of a therapist. Liz is thinking about whether she is comfortable with us opening up our relationship to other partners. Until she says she’s okay with me seeing other people I don’t want to do anything that would be cheating or betraying her trust. We have a good relationship and I’m always honest with her. 

Recently I met someone. Let’s call her Marie. Marie and I get on really well. We have been messaging a lot and have hung out a couple of times. I think there might be a spark of something more there but it’s early days. 

Both Marie and I are neurodivergent and find social interactions a little awkward but we enjoy hanging out and geeking out about our mutual interests. 

My question is when do I tell Marie about Liz and me being polly? It’s not just telling her that I am polly but also that Liz may or may not be comfortable with me going further than coffee and geeky chats with Marie. I need to wait and see. This feels like a lot to drop on someone. 

I want to be open and up front with Marie and not hide anything. But at the same time this feels like a lot of drop on someone at the very early stages of a relationship that might be friendship or more, it’s too early to tell. Is this an emotional burden for Marie?

I’m hesitant to tell Marie that I have a girlfriend in case she gets the wrong idea that I’m not interested in her or that things can’t go further than friendship. I also don’t want Marie to think that I’m leading her on or that I’m trying to cheat on Liz when I’m not. I’m just waiting for when or if Liz says she is happy with me seeing other people. I don’t connect with people easily and feelings like I have for Marie don’t happen all the time. 

Also telling Marie all this involves saying that I’m interested in more than friendship with her and it might be too early to have that conversation. 

I get the feeling that Marie would prefer to take things slow and see where they progress naturally, which is what I would like, but telling her about Liz could shape the whole future of our relationship but not telling her isn’t being honest and I want to be honest. I’m a bit stuck as this is all new to me. 

There is also the chance that Marie finds out about Liz in a way that is hurtful, such as running into the two of us in public and I don’t want to hurt her feelings that way. 

I would be happy just staying friends with Marie and continuing our geeky chats but if she wants more (and Liz is okay with it) I think we could have a beautiful relationship. 

There’s a whole lot of context to this as well but I feel like this post is already long enough. 

Please believe me that what I want most is to not hurt Liz or Marie and respect everyone’s feelings.

TL;DR when do I tell someone I am possibly very casually dating that I am polly?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

""Show your little Reddit group my new article. Maybe this will help them in this circus of a market. But don't let any morons think this is some kind of crystal ball. It's one more tool in the toolkit."" (Exact words)

Attached: His complete 3-prompt sentiment system. For free. Because apparently ""if people can't use free tools correctly, they don't deserve paid ones.""

What's inside:

• Prompt 1: Top 100 crypto influencers (Vitalik, Pomp, CT whales) → bullish %, narrative themes, herd direction  
• Prompt 2: Retail keywords (""buy the dip"" vs ""I'm ruined"") → panic scale, FOMO vs fear ratios  
• Prompt 3: Synthesis → divergence scores, contrarian setups (e.g., influencers neutral + retail panic = accumulation zone)

I tested it Nov 21 during the big dip:

Grok flagged BTC/ETH at 8/10 bounce confidence. Called it ""greed exhaustion reversing to fear."" 24 hours later? Both pumped maybe 4-6%. Not a huge spike, but a little coffee and donut gains if you caught it.

Fair.

For a bit of background, We have been really close friends since high school and even had a few flings here or there, but we were never really serious for one reason or another. These flings stopped entirely after the first few months of college, something about wanting to focus on studying. 

But then he revealed a couple months ago that he was dating this girl (19F), which I’ll call Louise. She’s always seemed a bit distant around me whenever she came over, but I never paid mind to it because she never bothered me and has even been friendly with me a couple times. We’ve had some perfectly pleasant conversations here and there.

Fast forward to a week ago, when out of the blue, I get a text from Louise asking to get coffee. I was a bit surprised and confused, but brushed it off as Mason giving my number to her in order for her and I to get closer.

It was there when, after chatting and getting to know about each other’s month, she proposes that I go on her podcast. After some pushing, I decided that if this was her way of letting me into her inner circle, I should go. I already don’t really have any friends here other than Mason, so why not? I would learn that was a big mistake.

At the podcast a few days after, I met the other host of it- I guess I’ll call her Jessie (19?F), and after some basic greetings and normal questions/talk… Louise asks me out of nowhere, “So many times did you fuck my boyfriend?”

I was obviously SHOCKED. I was quiet for a few seconds before responding, “What?” She repeats what she said with her full chest. I couldn’t (and still kinda can’t) tell if she was joking or not. She does have this deadpan humor, but the room felt so tense that I really couldn’t decipher it. The only thing I could say was, “Um…I’m sorry, I don’t really understand?” 

The two girls started shooting questions about Mason to me, all inappropriate. I refused to answer to any of it and just stood up. Now, here’s where I might be the buttface… Out of a mix of shock, confusion, discomfort, and anger, I snapped at them, “Oh my god, I’m not gonna deal with this childish bullshit”, sprinkled in a couple insults about her behavior, personality, and appearance before walking out. I still feel kind of bad about it, but I was really mad at the time.

Now yesterday, I noticed Mason didn’t really talk to me. I hadn’t mentioned anything about the podcast to him since I didn’t want him to be caught up in this, but i assume his girlfriend told him and, out of respect, just kept my distance to give him space because i wouldnt know what to do either if i was in his position.

What i didnt expect was when night time came, Mason asked to talk with me. He started to dig into me about insulting Louise’s podcast and that I was very rude after she invited me to something that I could’ve befriended her in. I refuted, mentioning the weird ass question she asked about us.

He sort of went silent for a second before confessing that he got a bit too tipsy while drinking with her and her friends last month (I assume Jessie was one of them) and revealed our on-and-off flings. One of those flings was WHILE THEY WERE DATING…I did NOT know about it, and apparently it was from our last one before starting college. I was pretty pissed hearing this as I am VERY against cheating and hate that I was strung into it without my knowledge at some point.

Apparently they were able to work through it, but I still didn’t know why I got the brunt of her wrath if I didn’t even know what was going on and insisted to Mason that I wasn’t in the wrong for defending myself, but he disagreed and believed, although very inappropriate, her reaction was understandable. The argument got pretty heated before we both decided we were too tired for this and would just go to bed.

This morning, I thought it through, and I started to feel bad about it. In her eyes, I’m the girl who tried to steal her man, and if I were to hear that from a boyfriend, I would also be pissed at everything and everyone. I am also a jealous person and would probably want to get a lot of answers too. Along with that, if I had the woman who my boyfriend cheated on me with call my show “childish bullshit”, I would be mad too…

I don’t really have anyone who’s not connected to Mason to talk to about this and I don’t want to lose both my friend and my room over this incident, so AITA for calling my friend’s gf’s podcast childish podcast, meanwhile I was the other woman she was calling out?

TL;DR: My friend’s gf invited me to her podcast only to ask me inappropriate questions about me and my friend. I called it childish, only to find out that he cheated on her with me at some point and now I’m questioning whether she was in the right. ",1,1763897524.0,AITAforfun,0,1.0,False

Something unusual happened to me and I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.

Mind you, nothing ever happened between us — at most, there was an ambiguous friendship.

But her message made me realize, paradoxically, that she has always liked me. And that put me into this strange state of calm, peaceful awareness — as if I already know that she and I will end up together as a couple. I don’t care when or how it will happen, I just know it already is, inside me.

My friend had repeatedly asked ""Is [my name] okay with this?"" And my partner assured her I was, but always said they couldn't be 100% sure.

And they kept going anyway. My best friend at least should have said that if they weren't 100% sure they should stop. They were willing to take even a 1% risk of destroying my life over not sexting each other. And now I don't feel like a human being. I've spent every day feeling like a movie character - none of the words coming out of my mouth feel like my own, I feel like I'm acting. This doesn't happen to me. The world feels plastic. They called her names they only call me. 

I found out on Thursday and I've slept over with them every day since. I didn't shower until yesterday morning when I had to for work, and then I got through my whole shift shedding tears when I turned around to use the coffee machines. I always feel weird because even though I'm diagnosed with BPD now I still feel like my anger is different to other people with BPD's, or at least it's more internal. I don't get angry at other people I just get angry at myself, I just hate myself. I've changed in their room but I can't let them see my body, I feel like I'm in a school changing room before and after PE. 

I wasn't able to look them in the eyes without feeling disgusted with myself unless I was stoned until yesterday afternoon. We finally talked about things in a somewhat productive way. The only thing that hurts more than this is the thought of not being with them. I don't know if it's fixable unless we try and see how I feel. I have no concept of how I'll react to things and if I'll be able to trust again until I try. They want me to make a list of requirements, things I want to regain their trust. My number one is I want them to go to therapy. They said it was a distraction, that they were really upset and it was a selfish distraction. And if that's the case then they need therapy either way because that's not fucking normal or healthy and on a BPD subreddit I'm sure we're all quite familiar with similar forms of distraction.

I've never been more sincerely suicidal in my life. Every attempt before, and there's nearly double digits now, has been at least partially impulsive, but this isn't. I have nothing left. My best friend who I've spoken to every day for a decade, who knew everything about me, who I would have happily been buried beside if we both died single. She knew what this would do to me specifically. Cheating fucks anyone up. But someone with BPD and specifically me. After everything I've told her. My partner heard me talking in the kitchen to our friends the other day about how cheating is the one thing that would really just make me give up. Like after I've been cheated on there's nothing left in life for me - I'll never recover from it and if I even lived through it I wouldn't be a person anymore. And they still did it anyway. 

I just keep thinking about disappearing forever. I keep wondering if maybe they'd feel half as guilty as I feel utterly despairing. I keep dreaming about if my attempts last year worked and I'm not living this right now. Our routine is wake up, I cry on them for ages and ask them why, they say they don't know, I eventually calm down and roll us a few joints, and we smoke and I pretend they still love me like they did before and enjoy the feeling of their arms around me and pray it won't be the last time. I just want to forget it ever happened and keep loving them with no doubts and no fears. 

The best time we've had since was yesterday after our talk. We were both so cautiously happy. I could look them in the eyes again, I could face them when we hugged, we made out a bit while stoned and we weren't crying onto each other this time. 

I don't even really know why I'm posting I just have nowhere else to go. My friends are supporting me either way but definitely don't want me to choose the option I am. But I feel like they'll never be able to understand the feeling of being in love with BPD. I still love them more than anything, and even if it would be easier to hate them, the thought of hating them makes me ill - it's the last thing I want in the world. Their head is resting on my lap while they're asleep right now and all I want to do is play with their hair. Even outside of my BPD I know I love them, I've seen too many of their flaws and know they're not perfect and split on them already very badly last year when talking to one of my friends and even then.

We're usually so communicative. We make everything work and we talk through everything and compromise for each other and I truly thought despite all of our collective issues we could seriously get through anything bar them actively wronging me like this. And then they did it. And now I don't feel like a human being anymore ",1,1763897106.0,BPD,4,0.6,False

Firstly I want to say that this post is all in jest, it’s just a few gripes have had over the last couple of days so please don’t come at me 😂 I do really love the new DLC I think it’s great what they’ve done and I am loving the horses! 


- Where is my Aladdin gem stall?! 🤷🏻‍♀️🧐
- Speaking of gems, is Japer and Honeycomb Stone a myth? They must be buried way way wayyyy deeeep down, as even with my pickaxe potions they still ain’t coming out! I have mined ONE I repeat ONE shiny Honeycomb Stone since I unlocked Pixie Arces 2 days ago! I don’t mind the grind but come on give me my reward now and again for putting in the graft!
- Please stop making all my fishing spots blue - if I see one more Tilipia, Crab, Tuna or Cod(for the love of cod, why?!) I will have a menty b 😭, plus I’d actually like to be able to use my fishing potions to catch the fish out of the gold ripples if you’re not going to let gold ripples spawn at all! (Big shoutout and thanks Moana you’ve done me a solid by giving me a couple of each, you the GOAT 🐐)
- Please let me sit on my horse and fish, kinda wearing thin having to get on and off all the time just to fish out Tilipia 🙄
- Goofys train stall - love the idea and the concept - but please let me just place it! Why he gotta be zooming everywhere and blocking the bridges? And another thing what’s with the 10 of each seed?! The hoarder in me does not approve and I am very disappointed 😭 
- Going back to seeds and fish - why are we still getting things tied to the main valley? I WANT NEW COLLECTABLES 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 - I am a HOARDER, so I have chests filled to the brim with everything from the valley and other DLC’s - give me new things to hoard, more fish, more gems, more flowers, more foragables, more fruit and veggies, heck even more meals to cook! - Huge missed opportunity on new fruits and veggies in my opinion, so many ideas running through my brain in what you could’ve added! (PM and I’ll share my ideas for moonstones 😉😂)
- On a positive note all the craftables you’ve given us is just *chefs kiss* 🤌🏻😙 shame I can’t craft half of them due to the drop rates of some items looking at you Jasper👀 
- I AM IN LOVE WITH THE COLOUR AND AESTHETIC AND BASICALLY EVERYTHING TO DO WITH GLAMOUR GULCH!!! Please let me change the terrain of every biome to that colour please and thank you! Also I want Cruella De Vil’s house, so gimme the house skin, I wanna match my new bestie 🤪 In fact lemme have her house her interior is 👌🏻 The spiral staircase and the wardrobe 😍  just all the furniture tbh
- Why so little new clothing options? You have given us the Fashionista Diva, that is Cruella yet no new clothes?! Friendship rewards don’t count! - Plus Tiggers Tail shoulda been a glider, let me bounce along with the wee cutie! - Big opportunities you had again but sadly didn’t take 😒 
- Scrooge, my duck, you definitely need some new stock in your shop in fact in all your shops! I’ve been playing since early access and there are still things I do not have! 
- Wall-e I love you you’re adorable, but I don’t need/want any more Wheat or Sugarcane from your wee garden, give me Dark Chocolate Coffee Beans and Scarlet Kale!!😤 
- I think you’ve put Eton Mess and Vintage Peach Trifle in the wrong food category, they are not Entree’s they are Desserts, The Brit in me is fuming 😤😂 There are also others but cannot remember them off the top of my head. 

I think that’s my wee rant over, I’m sure there is more😂 thanks for reading!😁😂

1p4kd3v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4kd3v,"To break, or not to break the mycelium","So I have two covered indoor bins and after a few months, both seemed to have formed a slab of mycelium under the surface, fusing the cardboard and coffee grounds together into a solid flat plate that covers the entire cross section of the bin just under the surface.

It requires quite a bit of force to poke through it with my garden fork, but I was pleasantly surprised to observe that when I placed a worm on top, it was still able to tunnel it's way through (or squeeze through the gaps), but it did struggle quite a bit.



I'm curious as to whether it's a good idea to break up the mycelium chunk and mix it in.



On one hand, breaking up the chunk would seem to provide better aeration into the lower levels of the bin, allow better mobility of the worms, and provide more surface area for the worms to attack the mycelium. Also to accelerate the seeding of the fungus through all the bedding.

  
However, another thought is that keeping the mycelium connected will keep it ""stronger"" and potentially cause it to break down the cardboard more efficiently?? Also with the added benefit of minimising disrupting the worms.

  
The worms currently aren't trying to escape and it still smells nicely of earth, so I assume the bin is healthy.",3,1763896900.0,Vermiculture,1,1.0,False

We lost our love, but to honor our love we must move forward.  Not on, never on-- forward. With that I am going to share a weird musing...

  
When my wife passed, after a few months I switched from a coffee pot to a Keurig. Half my coffee pot passed away... Weekend mornings there wasn't a need for a pot. The cold, half-empty coffee pot (especially during the winter) was just another reminder of what I had lost. I remember at the time making a facebook post about it... its strange what little things we attach our memories to. 

  
About 2 1/2 years ago, after 14-15 months of just horrible dating decisions why I processed my grief (yep, if you did the math I started dating way too early), I fell in love with a work colleague that was always there.  Now we live together, officially coming up on two years in the spring, we have a blended family- her son from her 1st marriage, my daughter and us... we've swapped out her Keurig for a combo pot and single serve.  Funny enough, the same one my wife and I owned. 

  
The memory makes me smile now. Even if my new love doesn't know it, its a simple and quiet way I can remember all the good from the first love as I continue the good with my second love.

I, (male 22) was in a relationship when I was 18-20. My ex and I knew each other since we were 14, and were good friends. We realized we had feelings for each other and started dating on off for about 6 months then called it quits until her high school graduation. We lived in different states at this time so I took a train to see her. The last night I stayed there we had sex and it was good and fine. We made it official after that and were long distance for about a year before things went bad at home for me so I packed up and took the train again to move in with her. That was a bad idea. About a month in the honeymoon phase of living together wore off, but we weren’t exactly fighting. She had a high libido and I had a low one at the time as I was fighting through some depression. She was the cause of my depression at that point. When I say we “weren’t exactly fighting” I mean that I would do something that annoyed her and she would call me stupid, pathetic, or even just worthless. It would always be something small like I forgot to feed my cat right at 6:00 and instead fed her at 6:02 (she WAS my cat that I adopted on my own before she and I got together) or I left the tv remote on arm of the couch vs on the coffee table. She burned it into my mind that I truly was pathetic, stupid and worthless. I never fought back though. I never stood up for myself and I never once spoke back to her. Every time I would try to she would break down in tears and say things like “I’m sorry I’m an awful terrible girlfriend I’m just gonna kill myself” or “please don’t leave me I’ll die without you” and I would give in. I found out pretty quickly after moving in with her that she was cheating on me. A lot. With a lot of different guys. I never said anything though. Not until I caught her in the act. She freaked out and told me that if I had sex with her more she wouldn’t have to do this and to “look what I made her do” as the guy was doing her. After that I started to look forward to leaving the house and going to work. I worked extra shifts and longer shifts just to avoid going home. (She only worked 2 hours a week on Saturdays because she was a birthday party host at a chocolate shop. Exclusively a party host) so I was the breadwinner and paying for everything for her. Unfortunately looking back this wasn’t the smartest idea. I would come home exhausted from working 10-11 hours everyday and she would immediately jump on me and tell me to go to the bedroom. When I tried to say no she would get all angry with me and start demanding I go to the bedroom or she would cut herself. I kept trying to tell her I was exhausted and didn’t want to have sex but then she would grab a knife from the kitchen so eventually I would just take off my pants and go into our room. We would do things until she finished and then I would just go to sleep without eating. That routine would continue on until it escalated even further. Eventually she told me she wanted to take the knife with us to the room so I could “use it on her” I had no idea what that mean but I said no. I didn’t want that knife anywhere near me or her. She said fine and she will just use it on herself in a bad place. She actually put the knife to her throat and I saw her push down. I panicked and stopped her telling her I would do what she wanted. She would happily squeal and run off the bedroom with the knife. Continuing the routine I would drop my pants and follow her. I found out she wanted me to use the knife on her ass. I HATED the idea of this but remembered what she said she would do if I didn’t. So I played along. Silently Crying each and every time. She CONTINUED to want more things. She wanted me to drug her, have sex with her while she was asleep, she even asked me to rape her. She explained this as she would walk down the street and I would go in my car, act like I don’t know her, and pull her into my car and drive back to our house where I would “have my way with her” I did absolutely none of that. Her threats continued though so I created a comprise. She could pretend to be asleep, I could pretend to break into our house stuff like that. She went along with that and once more. I was silently crying the whole time. Eventually she would just stop asking for sex and would take my pants off in my sleep and try to stimulate my body. I would wake up often with her just riding me or trying to stimulate me. If I got morning wood it was over for me. I would wake up with my pants around my ankles and she would be on top of me. Each time I would wake up sobbing. 
I met a girl when I was 20 that I was actually interested in and we became quick friends. We made such an instant connection that I actually told this girl what was happening to me. She revealed that she herself was leaving a bad DV situation where rape was a constant so she understood what I was going through. This was during a week where my girlfriend was visiting her grandparents in Georgia so I was alone. Also during this alone time I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me again. This time. With another girl who I considered a good friend. I even bought her newborn son clothes. I sent her money to feed her baby. I showed my new friend this evidence and she told me that none of this was right and I needed to leave. We talked and talked and finally I decided it was time. I texted my girlfriend that I was done and I was leaving and she FREAKED out. She even texted my new friend (I found out later she had multiple hidden apps in my phone that tracked EVERYTHING and that’s how she got my friends number) she was coming home the next day so I put a lot of my stuff in my car and slept in it for the night. I was expecting to be alone. But my friend actually stayed with me. When my ex got home she kept trying to get me to come over. I said I would only come over when I found a new place to move into so I can take the rest of my belongings and my cat. Well the time came for that. I got a new apartment with my new friend and we were getting settled for a few days with her dog and getting ready to introduce him to my cat. During this time my ex kept sending me and my friend hateful disgusting texts which included threats about claiming I abused her and raped her and told me she had pictures and videos of everything. I guess she knew she was gonna lose me soon and that’s when she started asking for more extreme stuff. She did indeed had multiple pictures and videos of the awful things I did but nothing about her requesting these things, so it really did look like I was an abusive rapist. When these pics and vids got sent to me AND my friend I broke down. This stuff was happening for a year and all of that pent up anger and sadness came out all at once. I couldn’t compose myself for three hours. I really thought I WAS an abuser and a rapist. I thought about killing myself or turning myself into the police. Just giving up. My friend held me the entire time though. Crying right along with me. She told me she could see the tears in my eyes in the videos. Every single one she could tell I was crying. She could tell I didn’t want to do any of it. She told me she believed me and that gave me enough hope to keep fighting. I felt worthless again though. I kept asking myself what kind of man allows a girl to do this to him? What kind of man sobs into the arms of a girl he met a month prior? What kind of man sobs like that anyways? I was so powerless. So weak. I couldn’t take it anymore. 
The last time I saw my ex she spent the whole day demanding I come over and that it was important. I gathered my entourage (my roommate and another friend I made at work) and finally went over. Thinking I was just getting my stuff and my cat. Man was I wrong. I had been fighting this girl to get my cat back a lot. When I got to her place the ALMOST THE ENTIRE police department was waiting for me. (It was a small town. Only 20 cops) they handed me a letter from a vet I’ve never heard of that said my cat was brought in for a checkup and that the owner listed in their records was my ex. Even though her adoption paperwork was sitting on my counter at my apartment. They said I couldn’t do anything and that I needed to leave right away. I asked why they were there in the first place and at first the officer I was speaking to wouldn’t tell me and then another officer later told me it was because they received a call that I was threatening to show up to “steal the cat” so I and my roommate showed the many texts demanding that I come over that we both received. They said it didn’t matter and that I was being trespassed. So I left. I had to leave my babygirl in that house. I left a huge part of my world to rot in that house. I had to pull over on the way home and I broke again. I screamed at the top of my lungs and cried so hard. Now I suffer from stress induced seizures which can range from focal awareness seizures to full on tonic-clonic seizures (grand Mals) my roommate pulled into the backseat when she realized what was about to happen because I stopped screaming and crying and just went dead silent. Sure enough. I started convulsing. I had previously showed my roommate the discharge paperwork from the hospital I was diagnosed with these seizures at that explained everything. Including that weren’t life threatening unless they lasted more than 5 minutes or if I had more than 5 1 minute long ones. I ended up having 4 in the backseat of my own car. My work friend drove my car back home and they got me back in bed. My friend walked home after that as she lived in the building across the street from us. My roommate laid next to me in my bed and stayed awake all night making sure I was okay. I was never the same after that night. My ex filed for an order of protection against me and because I never showed up she got it. (Allegedly. I can’t find any actual court documents to support that and I was never served.) she also posted on social media about how she left her “extremely abusive relationship” a LOT. She RUINED my reputation with our mutual friends and destroyed me in the process. 
With the help of my roommate (and now fiancee) I was able to mostly recover from that. But I’m less confident, I feel weaker and I still feel a little weary with sex but she reassures me in every way possible that she respects me and my boundaries. Shes made me feel a lot more comfortable then I was despite still being scared of other people. I don’t like to not be around her but I do it when I have to. I never got my cat back though. And I can’t even be in the same area I lived in before without panicking a lot. My ex finally stopped harassing me after a year of being broken up. But she still haunts me. I still have memories come up in my dreams and sometimes I still question if I was in fact the abuser. 
I’m happy to be away from her though. But I’m not sure I’ll ever get over my fear of strangers and specifically girls that look any bit similar to my ex.  ",1,1763896479.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

I’ve been struggling with this problem for about three months. It first started at work when I was very stressed and drank coffee on an empty stomach. My stomach began making “gurgling” sounds. It felt as if gas was trying to move up toward my throat but couldn’t. Shortly after that, I experienced two very strong PVCs, and for about two minutes I continued to have intermittent PVCs. I didn’t panic; I finished my work and went to the ER, but nothing abnormal was found.

After that episode, I started experiencing a constant sensation of something being stuck in my throat. The same noises come from my throat, and when I try to relax myself by pressing on the area, it makes a sound similar to releasing gas, but no actual gas comes out. This gives me chest discomfort, and I still get PVCs from time to time. The stuck feeling comes and goes, and it doesn’t seem related to meals.

I went to a gastroenterologist, who performed an endoscopy and said there was no reflux-related damage. I never had real pain or frequent heartburn anyway, only very rarely did I get a little acid reaching my mouth. I also saw an ENT specialist, who said there was nothing there that would cause this sensation. I no longer have significant stress in my life, yet after 3 months I still haven’t improved. I even saw a cardiologist, but the cause couldn’t be identified.

Yesterday I went to the cinema with friends, and the noises happened again. My friend even said, “Did that sound come from your stomach? I thought someone was vomiting,” even though there was another seat between us. I’m wondering if I might have an issue related to esophageal motility.

They experiment, try new things, use lots of equipment, and honestly I love that part. The issue is that they often leave the whole mess for the next day. That means pots, pans, trays, bowls, whisks, and whatever else was used will sit out overnight. When I wake up, I’m met with a dirty and cluttered kitchen. If I want to cook breakfast or even make coffee, I have to either clean their mess or work around it. Neither feels fair or enjoyable.

My view is simple. You should leave the kitchen as you found it by the time you finish cooking. This doesn’t mean I won’t do the dishes after we eat if my partner cooks for me. I’m fine handling plates, cutlery, or anything that gets dirty from serving. But the major equipment used during the process should be cleaned as you go. If a mixing bowl is done, wash it before moving on. If there’s water on the counter or pieces of food, wipe them up instead of leaving them overnight. The only real exception I see is serving dishes that are holding food until everyone is ready to eat.

To me, cleaning as you go keeps the kitchen usable, prevents mess from piling up, and respects the shared nature of the space. But my partner thinks it’s completely fine to leave everything until the next morning, and that I’m being too rigid by wanting things cleaned the same day.",22,1763896234.0,changemyview,35,0.68,False

Hey Reddit!  

I’ve been thinking a lot about how important it is to have good people around you, and I realized I’d love to expand my circle. Whether it’s sharing stories, laughing about random things, or just having someone to chat with after a long day, friendships make life so much richer. I’m genuinely interested in getting to know more people, hearing about your experiences, and learning what makes you tick. Everyone has something unique to share, and I think that’s what makes connecting so exciting.  

I’m pretty open-minded when it comes to activities. Hanging out online, grabbing coffee, exploring local spots,watching movies, or even just swapping memes  I’m down for it. What matters most to me is building authentic connections where we can support each other, have fun, and maybe even discover new hobbies together.  

If you’re also looking to meet new people, feel free to drop a comment or send a message. Tell me about yourself your favorite book, a hobby you’re passionate about, or even something silly that always makes you laugh. I’d love to start conversations that could grow into lasting friendships. Let’s make life a little brighter by connecting here!

1p4k1k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthicalNonMonogamy/comments/1p4k1k4/interacting_with_possibly_avoidant_meta_in_shared/,interacting with possibly avoidant meta in shared space,"I'm confused on how to handle this in an ethical way.   
English is not my native language.

All involved people are in their late 20s.

Been with my partner V (M, hierarchy, primary) for 5 years, poly since 2,5 years (with hierarchy because of living together and the long relationship, equal partnership is not what he or I can offer) , but before this meta it was only ONS. My meta K (F, testing out poly) and V have been dating for a few months. Problem is we work at the same place but different departments (it's messy, I know, V and I should have had a clearer messy-list beforehand....). 



I knew K before her an V were dating and we always greeted each other. Then when they started dating we started hanging out in a friend group mostly for coworking with sometimes other people, a few times only the 3 of us. So we saw each other a few times a week for a month or so, regularly sharing lunch. So in my mind we had a sort of soft friendship or at the very least it was okay for her to be in contact with me, since she didn't have to be there for co-working together with me and/or V, plenty other rooms were available. But lately I recognized that she's avoiding me (since a moth roughly) and I am very bad at handling unspoken conflict, so I asked my partner V (yes, I made that mistake, I realized now that I was overstepping, guided by my emotions) whether I'm imagining that K is avoiding me and he confirmed that she is (also oversharing from his side?). So now I feel weird.  

Maybe to add: V asked K what she is comfortable with him sharing to me about them and she said that she doesn't have a preference and he should decide on what to share. It's none of my business, but I think it sets V up to fail, because how is he supposed to make that decision for her when they are just getting to know each other? Also I don't get why V agreed to this, but it's his decision. 

When I saw her for something work-related (handing sth over, btw this almost never happens, we usually only pass each other in the hall) I said that I'm having a bit of a hard time right now with the situation of being in a space together and having not enough information on how to handle it in a way that accommodate everybodys needs, and if she felt okay I would be thankful to have a short talk over a coffee sometimes. She said she'd be up for that but right now it's to much for her (not timewise but emotion wise). I said thank you and to please reach out when she feels ready. But it's been 3 weeks now and she hasn't reached out.



So now I'm confused. If she was just a friend and not a meta I would be clear that I need to have a honest talk soon, to know what's the situation, but since she is my meta I don't want to force/pressure her into contact with me... to be claer, I dont want a friendship out of this, but it is constantly in my head at woork, since I could possibly see her in the hallway anytime and dont know how I'm supposed to interact. Do I greet? Do I ask smalltalk like ""How's your day?"". Would she prefer I ignore her?. I have no information what she needs.  
  
I think she's old enough to just tell me or text me, if ​she doesn't want to talk to me or have any contact, to be parallel and not KTP, or that we should leave it at saying hello. That would hurt a bit after builing what sort of felt like a frienship-beginning but I'd just have to deal with that. It would be a super valid decision in my opinion, she doesn't have to be friends with me but at least I'd like to know it and not ""play"" friends when we see each other (but of course I'd stay polite and cordial). Also I'm wondering why sb would start a relationship in a workplace if your preferred style is parallel. It just doesn't add up for me.

But with her saying ""not now, maybe later"" I feel like I don't have any agency or options, except for waiting, with feels so stressful and anxiety-inducing because I don't understand what's happening or what to do without overstepping again and starting triangulation with V... 

As far as I know V and K avoid this issue when they see each other (they have regular sleepovers at least once a week). I messed up by not setting a clear messylist and boundaries on not dating possibly-monogamous people, so now I cant backtrack and say ""Dont date sb from our workplace that is not wants strict parallel"", it would be unfair to both of them.

Happy to hear any advice, even more happy if you find kind words for it.

He's in the hospital with a broken leg and some bruised ribs. Nothing life threatening but enough to keep him there for observation. The accident happened three nights ago around 9pm. He told me he was running to the pharmacy to get me cold medicine because I'd been sick all week.

Except I didn't ask him to go. And when the hospital called me, they said his car was found 20 minutes in the opposite direction from any pharmacy near us.

When I got to the hospital, he was groggy from pain meds but conscious. I asked him what he was really doing out there. He got this panicked look and said he'd explain later. I said no, explain now. He tried to say he took a wrong turn. I asked him how you accidentally drive 20 minutes in the wrong direction.

He finally admitted he was meeting someone. A woman from his gym. They'd been seeing each other for about four months.

I just stared at him. Then I got up and left. Didn't say a word, just walked out of that hospital room and drove home.

The next day his mom called. Said she'd been at the hospital and my husband told her everything. She wanted to meet for coffee to talk. I figured she was going to apologize for raising a cheater or something. I was wrong.

She sat down and said, ""I know you're upset but we need to focus on damage control."" I asked what she meant. She said that people were asking questions about why he was so far from home, that some family members knew I was sick and were confused about why he'd drive past closer pharmacies.

I said maybe he should tell them the truth then. She looked horrified. Said that would humiliate the family, that people talk and it would ruin his reputation. That I needed to back up his story that he was getting medicine for me and just got confused because he was worried about me.

I laughed. Actually laughed in her face. Told her I wasn't covering for him. She got this stern look and said I was being selfish, that marriage means protecting each other, and that this ""little incident"" didn't need to become public knowledge.

I said it wasn't a little incident, he was cheating on me. She waved her hand like she was swatting a fly and said, ""Men make mistakes. You don't blow up a marriage over a mistake.""

I told her I wasn't blowing up anything, he did that when he started screwing someone else. She said I was being dramatic and that if I really loved him I'd help him through this rough time instead of making it worse.

I left. Blocked her number.

Two days later I'm at the hospital visiting, not because I forgive him but because I needed to talk about what happens next. His whole family was there. His mom, his dad, his sister. They all got quiet when I walked in.

His sister pulled me aside and said, ""Mom told us you're refusing to help with the story. You know that's going to make everything harder for all of us right?""

I said I didn't care. She said I was being vindictive, that yeah, he messed up, but did I really want to be the reason the whole family got embarrassed. I told her to get out of my face.

When I got back to the room, his dad tried. Said that he understood I was hurt but that families stick together, and the right thing to do was present a united front. That once we worked through our ""private issues"" I'd regret having aired dirty laundry.

I snapped. Told all of them that I wasn't lying for him, that if people asked I was telling the truth, and that they could all stop harassing me about protecting a cheater's reputation.

My husband started crying. Said I was trying to destroy him. That if people knew the truth he'd lose respect at work, in the community, everywhere. I said maybe he should have thought about that before cheating.

I left again. That was yesterday.

Since then I've gotten calls and texts from extended family. His cousins, his aunt, even family friends. All saying the same thing. That I'm making this worse than it needs to be. That marriage is about forgiveness. That I'm being cruel by refusing to help him save face when he's already hurt and vulnerable.

His mom sent me a long text about how she raised him better than this but that everyone deserves grace, and that I'm proving I never really loved him by being willing to humiliate him publicly. She said a good wife would put the marriage first.

I told her a good husband wouldn't have been driving to screw another woman.

Now half his family isn't speaking to me. The other half keeps trying to convince me to ""do the right thing."" My own parents are split. My mom says I should just tell people he was getting medicine because what does it matter, everyone will find out about the divorce anyway. My dad says I don't owe him or his family anything.

Some friends think I should just let it go and tell the white lie because it's not worth the drama. Others say his family is insane for even asking.

But I keep thinking about how they all knew what he did and their first instinct wasn't to tell him he was wrong. It was to get me to lie so they didn't look bad.

Am I being vindictive by refusing to cover for him? Should I just tell people he was getting medicine and move on with the divorce quietly? AITAH?",9,1763895706.0,FoundandExpose,8,1.0,False

1p4jxfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChemistry/comments/1p4jxfp/do_caffeine_and_alcohol_share_any_chemical/,Do caffeine and alcohol share any chemical components?,"Hello everyone :) 

  
So this is a weird one. I have started having a thing where drinking anything with caffeine or alcohol causes a weird smell to come out of my skin, I think maybe in my body oils but it happens within a couple of hours and can last two days. It’s a strong smell, and not psychosomatic as others can smell it, and it’s not pleasant. It clings to clothing, towels, bedding etc, and comes off my hair, face, body, feet etc. 

I’ve been thoroughly checked by my doctor and there’s nothing wrong with me physically. My liver and kidneys are fine, I even had scans of them to be sure. 

So now I’m wondering, do these two substances - alcohol and caffeine - share any chemical constituents in common which could be responsible? Obviously there’s going to be a bunch of overlap, but I’m wondering if there’s anything in particular which might be at fault. 

  
Any help would be much appreciated, as I’m losing my mind over this at this point. It’s been more than a year, and it’s very sensitive - even the tiny amount of caffeine in “caffeine-free” tea and coffee will set it off! 

  
Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this, and I hope that you have a wonderful day! 😊",2,1763895332.0,AskChemistry,1,1.0,False

The options are beautiful, a bit intimidating, and you want to make sure you get the right one without looking like a total newbie. You know they’re superior tools, but with all the different names and shapes, where does one even begin?

Well, let’s demystify it a bit. Think of your first high-quality Japanese knife not as a single tool for everything, but as the start of a beautiful relationship with your kitchen. It’s about finding the one that feels right in your hand and matches how you actually cook. For many, that journey starts with two classic styles: the Gyuto and the Nakiri.

The Gyuto, or ""chef's knife,"" is arguably the most popular gateway into this world. It’s the versatile all-rounder, the workhorse. With its gently curved blade that rocks effortlessly, it’s designed to handle a huge range of tasks. Slicing meats, dicing onions, mincing herbs—the Gyuto does it all with a graceful efficiency that can make you feel like a pro even on a Tuesday night. If your cooking style is a little bit of everything and you could only have one really good knife, the Gyuto is often the recommended champion. It’s that reliable friend who’s always up for whatever you’re making.

Then there’s the Nakiri. This one is a specialist, and its straight, rectangular profile is unmistakable. Designed specifically for vegetables, the Nakiri is a game-changer for anyone who spends a lot of time at the cutting board with produce. Its flat edge allows for a straight-up-and-down chopping motion, which means you can fly through a pile of carrots or cucumbers with stunning precision and very little sticking. It glides through a tomato with a clean, effortless push. If you’re cooking a lot of plant-based meals or just want to make your veggie prep a true joy, the Nakiri is a compelling choice that feels uniquely purpose-built.

So, how to choose? It’s less about a rigid rule and more about your own habits. Do you crave one knife that can confidently tackle 90% of your tasks? Lean towards the Gyuto. Does the thought of a tool perfectly engineered for the artistry of vegetable prep make your heart sing? The Nakiri might be calling your name.

Once you’ve made that exciting choice, the journey isn’t over. A fine knife deserves fine care, and that’s where the right [Japanese accessories](https://kaitsuko.com/) come into play. A good whetstone isn’t just an accessory; it’s the key to maintaining that legendary sharpness. And protecting your investment with a simple blade guard or a slot in a wooden block are small steps that ensure your first great knife won’t be your last.

At the end of the day, selecting your first Japanese knife is a personal step towards more mindful and enjoyable cooking. Whether you gravitate towards the versatile Gyuto or the specialized Nakiri, you’re not just buying a kitchen tool. You’re choosing an instrument that, with a little care and the right companion Japanese accessories, will transform your daily meal prep into something you genuinely look forward to.",1,1763895007.0,GoodContent,0,1.0,False

25/F my bf is 36/M ofw long distance 5 months in relationship we met on dating app, we met once dito sa pinas and nakwento nya na he has a hoe phase back then, I saw a lot of red flags about him 

example;

nung umuwi siya nalaman ko na nakipagkita pa siya sa ex nya kase kasi may pinapasuyo daw since uuwi naman siyang pinas, how did i know? But He told me because I asked when was the last time they met each other but who knows what else they did plus he can’t cut the communication totally kase primary owner siya ng car ni girl and and the co owner is the girl.

+ he entertained yung nirereto sakanya ng friend nya via chat no sweet message just a plain “hi” “hello” and kamustahan and ang reason nya is nirerespeto nya lang yung kaibigan nya na nagreto kaya nireplyan nya yung babae hindi naman nagtagal yung usap nila ng babae since nahuli ko agad

+ he kept mentioning her friends na niyaya daw siya lumabas or mag coffee btw they had s*x back then and the other friend is clingy daw pag magkasama sila. But hindi pa naman sya sumasama so far sinasabi nya lang daw na niyaya sya kase ayaw nya mag lihim saken.

+ nung hindi pa kami nagkikita personally nalaman ko na ang sabi nya lang sa mga kaibigan nya ay may kikitain lang sya dito sa pinas even tho we already have label na,reason nya is ayaw nya munang sabihin kase baka daw hindi naman mag work out pero lagi nyang sinasabi na sure na sya saken, yes naging kami na before we met personally

And a lot more but ayan yung mga tumatak sa isip ko. All of that ginawa nya within our relationship, bago siya pumunta dito sa pinas except don sa pag entertain ng reto. 

But the twist here is aside from i love him he is “walk the talk” name it surprises, efforts, spoils me, and shared his location and bago bumalik sya sa ibang bansa he gave me his credit card, the cctv of his house and also bought extra cctvs to cover all of the space of his apartment para daw magkaroon ako ng peace of mind and also he always includes me on every plans he has and he always mentioned his plans about us in the future.

But even though he did all of that I can’t have the peace of mind that I’m looking for. 

I’m hanging to the thought na maybe this time he is sincere na since we already saw each other personally",2,1763894866.0,OALangBaAko,6,1.0,False

Either my meds fell out of my bag or I forgot them, but either way I don't have them. I'm from the US and traveling with my partner for the next week, and I know I'm going to be super tense and forgetful and likely experience depressive symptoms (based on experience with a previous change in dosage).

I know stimulants aren't prescribed here (edit: adderall specially) and I know I wouldn't be able to get a prescription anyway, but if anyone would have a suggestion for either a substitute or over the counter alternative (of course only things obtained legally and readily available) that could minimize symptoms or withdrawals (I have ibuprofen, but that's all), I would be so grateful. Otherwise it will just be a lot of coffee.

I usually take 15mg adderall and 150 mg wellbutrin daily, as well as a 60mg beta blocker for migraines. Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated. The brain fog is already so bad.

Edited to add: With respect to sub rules, I was to clarify that I am not seeking medical advice or ""alternative medication"" that is not legal or would be obtained unethically, just any guidance towards what is available (or guidance towards addressing symptoms) since rules and all that differ form country to country.",7,1763894609.0,ADHD,18,1.0,False

25/F my bf is 36/M ofw long distance 5 months in relationship we met on dating app, we met once dito sa pinas and nakwento nya na he has a hoe phase back then, I saw a lot of red flags about him 

example;

nung umuwi siya nalaman ko na nakipagkita pa siya sa ex nya kase kasi may pinapasuyo daw since uuwi naman siyang pinas, how did i know? But He told me because I asked when was the last time they met each other but who knows what else they did plus she can’t cut the communication totally kase primary owner siya ng car ni girl and and the co owner is the girl.

+ he entertained yung nirereto sakanya ng friend nya via chat no sweet message just a plain “hi” “hello” and kamustahan and ang reason nya is nirerespeto nya lang yung kaibigan nya na nagreto kaya nireplyan nya yung babae hindi naman nagtagal yung usap nila ng babae since nahuli ko agad

+ he kept mentioning her friends na niyaya daw siya lumabas or mag coffee btw they had s*x back then and the other friend is clingy daw pag magkasama sila. But hindi pa naman sya sumasama so far sinasabi nya lang daw na niyaya sya kase ayaw nya mag lihim saken.

+ nung hindi pa kami nagkikita personally nalaman ko na ang sabi nya lang sa mga kaibigan nya ay may kikitain lang sya dito sa pinas even tho we already have label na,reason nya is ayaw nya munang sabihin kase baka daw hindi naman mag work out pero lagi nyang sinasabi na sure na sya saken, yes naging kami na before we met personally

And a lot more but ayan yung mga tumatak sa isip ko. All of that ginawa nya within our relationship, bago siya pumunta dito sa pinas except don sa pag entertain ng reto. 

But the twist here is aside from i love him he is “walk the talk” name it surprises, efforts, spoils me, and shared his location and bago bumalik sya sa ibang bansa he gave me his credit card, the cctv of his house and also bought extra cctvs to cover all of the space of his apartment para daw magkaroon ako ng peace of mind and also he always includes me on every plans he has and he always mentioned his plans about us in the future.

But even though he did all of that I can’t have the peace of mind that I’m looking for. 

I’m hanging to the thought na maybe this time he is sincere na since we already saw each other personally",0,1763894425.0,adviceph,5,0.5,False

1p4jn56,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p4jn56/small_talk_is_a_superpower_if_you_know_how_to_use/,Small talk is a superpower (if you know how to use it): the underrated life skill no one teaches you,"Ever notice how some people seem to *magically* make friends wherever they go, while others awkwardly swirl their drinks and count ceiling tiles waiting for an exit? Yeah. That’s small talk, possibly the most ridiculed but secretly powerful life skill we’re never properly taught.

Let’s be honest. Most of us learned small talk from watching our parents discuss the weather with neighbors, or from painfully clunky networking events. And now? TikTok and IG are flooded with “alpha mindset” bros preaching “don’t talk unless it’s deep” like silence is sexy. Sorry, but if you can’t hold a normal conversation with a stranger, you’re not mysterious, you’re socially stunted.

I’ve spent years diving into communication research, behavioral science, and psychology. Not just because I was curious, but because I noticed how many smart, creative, and thoughtful people were getting held back by this one quiet skill. And the worst part? They blamed themselves. Thought they were “awkward” or “not charismatic enough.”

The truth is, small talk isn’t shallow. It’s a gateway. And just like any other skill, it can be practiced, improved, and even mastered.

Here’s a breakdown of what actually works, based on research, not recycled pick-up artist nonsense.

**Tips to instantly level up your small talk game**

- **Stop trying to be interesting. Be interested.**  
  Harvard’s social psychologist Dr. Charles Duhigg explains in *The Power of Habit* that people are neurologically wired to feel pleasure when talking about themselves. So instead of trying to sound clever or polished, ask real questions, then *actually* listen. The most magnetic people aren’t great speakers. They’re great listeners.

- **Use what Vanessa Van Edwards calls “threading.”**  
  In the *Captivate* book and her TEDx talks, she teaches how to pick up one “thread” from what someone says and weave a deeper conversation. If someone says “I had a crazy day at work,” don’t just go “Aw man, that sucks.” Ask, “What happened?” or even “What kind of crazy?”, it opens them up.

- **Avoid the three conversational dead zones:**  
  Weather, basic pleasantries, and “So, what do you do?” Instead, use light but unexpected openers like:  
   - “What’s your favorite part of your week so far?”  
   - “Are you more of a coffee or tea person?”  
   - “What’s something random that made you laugh recently?”  
   They’re simple, but they give people permission to be human.

- **Mirror their energy, but with 10% more warmth.**  
  Sociolinguistics researcher Dr. Deborah Tannen showed that people subconsciously respond better to others who match their energy. But if you add just a tiny bit more warmth or enthusiasm, it makes you more memorable and likeable, without seeming fake.

- **Don’t fear pauses.**  
  People overcorrect for silence with randomness or self-blame (“I’m so bad at this”). Instead, own the pause. Sip your drink. Smile. Ask a follow-up. Not every second needs to be filled.

- **Prepare a few “pocket topics.”**  
  These aren’t fake scripts, they’re like mental bookmarks. Could be a podcast you liked, a weird news story, a new restaurant you tried. Author Dan Pink recommends this in *To Sell Is Human*, having a “conversation repertoire” helps you glide through awkward moments without sounding rehearsed.

**Resources that helped me get better at small talk and social fluency**

- **Book: *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer**  
  Written by a former FBI agent who specialized in behavior analysis. National bestseller. He breaks down how rapport works at a psychological level and shows simple cues (like the “eyebrow flash” or the angle of your feet) that change how people respond to you. Insanely good read. It made me realize how small signals affect big outcomes. This is the best book I’ve ever read on how people form instant connections.

- **YouTube: Charisma on Command**  
  Legit one of the best channels for understanding what makes people likable, confident, and socially fluent. They break down examples from pop culture (think: what makes Ryan Reynolds charming, or why Steve Carell’s awkwardness works). You get practical, breakdown-style content that doesn’t feel cringey.

- **Podcast: *The Art of Charm***  
  Doesn’t just teach you to “sound confident”, it digs into how to create presence, read body language, and build deeper conversations. Their interviews with guests like Vanessa Van Edwards and Nir Eyal are actually useful, not fluff. Good one for the gym or commute.

- **App: Insight Timer**  
  You might not link meditation to conversation, but here’s the deal, so much awkwardness comes from anxiety and overthinking. This app gives free access to hundreds of bite-sized meditations that reduce social anxiety and improve focus. The confidence boost from just 5 minutes a day is real.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  If you ever wished there was a coach in your pocket who could teach you how to actually talk to people better, this is it. You tell it what you’re struggling with (e.g., “I keep freezing up at parties” or “I hate small talk”) and it generates a personalized audio breakdown with insights pulled from top-tier books and research. I customized mine with a chill, sarcastic voice and it genuinely makes the learning fun instead of stiff. Built by folks from Columbia and Google, and the avatar (Freedia) even keeps track of what I’m learning and creates flashcards. I’ve replaced 30 mins of doomscrolling with this before bed, and it’s slowly rewiring how I think and talk to people.

Most people think charisma is either something you're born with or you'll never have. But like any skill, small talk is practice, not personality. Learn it, use it, and suddenly life becomes way less awkward and way more full of possibilities.",1,1763894266.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False
1p4jmed,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4jmed,[Survey] - Timemore c3 adjustment plate,"I have recently started a small 3d printing business. I found this mod online (link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5336394)

Basically this allows you to fine tune your c3 and allow more granular control over grind size by adding more steps.

I currently dont have the high tensile filament that this should use to handle the strength while grinding. I want to know how many of u would be interested in buying this? As i want to give something to coffee community im thinking ill be selling these for very little profits just in exchange of my time i invest. 

I request to please upvote this post for showing your interest so that I can get a rough idea if i should go ahead with this or not.

Additionally: To few guys who have ordered grinder/aeropress stands from me, ill try to include this with your order for free just to take your input and review. This would only be possible if i receive the filament on time before start printing your order

I cant imagine if this works it would save you all thousands of money with which you will not need to upgrade to an expensive grinder.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1p4jfbq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4jfbq,"Dennis the Menace - Boom Blast in Israel, courtesy of the Talibans - Part 8","Yes, Dennis is still clumsily rambling on after multiple failed card asks.  His problem is that his fake story is that he’s a US military doctor in Israel.  His sensational (made up) story doesn’t add up because at the time he was chatting me up, Trump was in Israel addressing the Knesset.

I absolutely despise it when they say something to the order of “rise and shine” like Dennis did because I well know they don’t work and I do.  They can fuck right off with that greeting.  So I was already in a mood to fight, and his assumption that I eat breakfast and have coffee every morning just made it worse.  Not so much that he asked, but when I tell him no, he wants to know why as if I am the one who owes an explanation.

Perhaps sensing my displeasure, Dennis excuses himself to “attend” to patients.  Yet another rise and shine and I’m not having it at 10 AM.  He tries to bother me on the weekend and I am a firm no on that.  This is kind of the reason why I don’t bait much anymore.  I work during the week and at the time I was also going to college, so I really don’t have time for these creeps during my off time.  Oh well.

Again with the lecturing about eating and Charlotte doesn’t appreciate being spoken to like a kid.  “Adults eat too” - this went right over his head.  Dennis starts into a possible card ask by complaining about a poor internet connection, but his subsequent explanation will sabotage it.  Why?

A huge “boom blast” explosion..  in Israel.  When Trump was there giving a speech.  I initially confused him with an oil rig scammer but he continued on and I then figured out he was the guy in Israel.  So, when Trump was there and a ceasefire in effect, a “boom blast” happened and American troops are injured.  OK…

Charlotte has to find out more about this boom blast and why she is not seeing this alongside the Trump visit on the news.  Who did it?  Hamas?

The Talibans…. 😂 

I’ve had enough of the stolen valor ones and when they speak to me like I am ignorant of world events it disgusts me.  So Charlotte calls him out on these obvious lies and how the Taliban are not in Israel nor were American troops injured.  He’s not in Israel.  Like the coward he is, Dennis disappears in the hope of getting a fresh start later.

Charlotte again reiterates that he cannot be in Israel.  Dennis understands he has been cornered and says he has been transferred to Damascus of course!  And that’s why he hasn’t texted for “months”.  Charlotte has a screenshot from 5 days previous where he admits to being in Israel that she shoves in his face.

For that I get a phone call that I refuse to answer.

True to form, Dennis continues on days later like he hadn’t already been caught out on several lies.

While I was at it, I treated myself to a coffee and sat there feeling elated, knowing my little one will be a little safer out there when she is parked up by herself.
