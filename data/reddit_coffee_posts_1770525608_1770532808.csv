I’m a 33M looking to team up with one or two responsible individuals to secure a solid place in Burnaby, Coquitlam, or New Westminster.

In this economy, renting solo on a budget is nearly impossible. I’m looking to bypass the ""roommate lottery"" by finding people now so we can vet each other and hunt for a high-quality 2-bedroom (or a 3-bedroom if we find the right third) together.

The Strategy:

• Timing: Start the search/tours 2–3 months out so we aren't rushing.

• Location: Near Skytrain preferred (Burnaby, New West, or Coquitlam).

• Process: Meet for coffee first \\bm{\\rightarrow} Align on budget \\bm{\\rightarrow} Apply as a solid group.

• Working professional, clean, and extremely reliable with rent/bills.

• Quiet during the week; I value a peaceful, organized home.

Ok so I've spent an embarrassing amount of time studying human attraction. Like genuinely embarrassing. I've read books from relationship psychologists, watched countless dating coaches break down body language, listened to evolutionary biologists explain mating signals, all because I was tired of misreading situations and making things awkward.



Here's what I learned: most advice about attraction is either too vague (""they'll just know"") or completely wrong. The truth is way more nuanced and honestly more interesting. These signs come from actual research in social psychology, communication studies, and behavioral science, not random internet opinions.



\*\*1. They mirror your body language without realizing it\*\*



This one's straight from social psychology research. When someone's attracted to you, they unconsciously copy your movements, your speech patterns, even how you're sitting. It's called the chameleon effect and it happens because our brains are literally trying to create rapport with people we like.



Pay attention next time you're together. If you lean in and they lean in moments later, if you cross your legs and they do the same, if you start using a phrase and suddenly they're saying it too, that's not coincidence. Their subconscious is screaming that they're into you.



\*\*2. They remember weirdly specific details about your life\*\*



Someone who likes you will remember that random story you told three weeks ago about your neighbor's cat, or that you mentioned preferring tea over coffee once in passing. Why? Because when you're attracted to someone, your brain flags everything they say as important.



I read this fascinating study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that found people have significantly better memory recall for information from romantic interests versus regular friends. It's literally hardwired into us.



If they bring up something you barely remember mentioning, that's your sign.



\*\*3. Their pupils dilate when they look at you\*\*



Sounds like pseudoscience but it's actually well documented. The autonomic nervous system causes pupil dilation when we see something we find appealing. You can't fake this, you can't control it. It just happens.



Obviously you're not gonna whip out a ruler and measure their pupils like a weirdo, but if you're in decent lighting and notice their eyes look bigger or darker when talking to you, there's your answer.



\*\*4. They find excuses to touch you (even briefly)\*\*



Touch is HUGE in attraction research. Even casual, ""accidental"" touches release oxytocin, the bonding hormone. If someone likes you, they'll unconsciously seek out reasons to make physical contact.



Brushing your arm when making a point. Touching your shoulder when laughing. Moving ""imaginary"" lint off your shirt. Sitting close enough that your legs touch. These aren't accidents, they're attraction signals.



The book \*[The Like Switch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)\* by Jack Schafer (former FBI behavioral analyst, guy literally studied human behavior for national security) breaks down how even the smallest touches create intimacy. If they're finding reasons to be in your physical space, they're interested.



\*\*5. They get slightly nervous around you\*\*



Contrary to what movies show, attraction doesn't always make people smooth and confident. Often it does the opposite. If someone seems a bit fidgety, laughs a little too hard at your mediocre jokes, or stumbles over words they'd normally say fine, that's nervous system activation from attraction.



Evolutionary psychology explains this as a stress response. When we're around someone we want to impress, our body goes into mild fight or flight mode. Heart rate increases, palms might sweat, speech gets faster or clumsier.



Not everyone shows this (some people are just naturally chill) but if you notice them being more flustered around you than others, take note.



\*\*6. They text you about random stuff\*\*



If they're sending you memes, asking your opinion on something trivial, or texting ""this reminded me of you"" regularly, they're looking for excuses to talk. People don't maintain consistent communication with someone unless they want that person in their life.



Research on computer mediated communication shows that people who are romantically interested initiate contact significantly more often and respond faster than those who aren't. It's not about WHAT they're saying, it's that they're creating opportunities for interaction.



\*\*7. They ask about your relationship status (directly or sneakily)\*\*



This one seems obvious but people miss it. If someone's trying to figure out if you're single, trying to gauge if you're interested in anyone, asking about your dating life in general, they're doing reconnaissance.



Sometimes it's direct. More often it's subtle, like mentioning their own single status to see how you respond, or asking if you're going to an event ""with anyone special."" They're testing the waters before making a move.



\*\*8. Their friends act weird around you\*\*



When someone has a crush, their close friends usually know about it. And those friends will often behave differently around you because of that knowledge.



They might tease your crush when you're around, suddenly leave you two alone together, or give each other knowing looks when you interact. Some might even ""accidentally"" mention that your crush was talking about you.



Social psychology research on peer groups and romantic relationships shows that people almost always confide in friends about attractions, so friend behavior is actually a pretty reliable indicator.



\*\*9. They make future plans with you\*\*



Someone who likes you will try to secure future time together. They'll mention a movie coming out that you'd both like, suggest trying that restaurant you mentioned, or ask if you're going to an upcoming event.



This is different from vague ""we should hang out sometime"" statements. We're talking specific future oriented suggestions, because they're trying to ensure they'll see you again.



According to research in relationship initiation, people who are romantically interested engage in significantly more future planning behaviors than those who view someone as just a friend.



\*\*10. You catch them staring\*\*



This is the most universal sign across cultures and research studies. Prolonged eye contact (especially when they look away quickly after you notice) is one of the strongest indicators of attraction.



We naturally look longer at things we find visually appealing or interesting. The book \*The Science of Likability\* by Patrick King breaks down eye contact patterns in attraction, basically if someone's looking at you when they think you won't notice, or holding eye contact longer than socially normal, their interest is showing.



The tricky part is most of us doubt ourselves even when signs are obvious. We think ""but what if they're just friendly"" or ""I'm probably reading too much into it."" But honestly, if you're noticing multiple signs from this list, you're probably not imagining things.



If you want to go deeper into understanding attraction patterns and relationship psychology without spending hours reading research papers, there's this personalized learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from books like \*[The Like Switch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)\*, dating psychology research, and expert insights on human behavior. You tell it your specific goal, like ""become more magnetic in dating as an introvert,"" and it creates a structured learning plan with audio episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology feel like chatting with a friend. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's been genuinely useful for connecting these patterns without the overwhelm.



Human attraction follows patterns. We can't help the biological and psychological signals we send when we like someone. So trust what you're observing, and maybe take a chance on making a move yourself. Worst case scenario, you get clarity. Best case, they've been waiting for you to notice.",1,1770531811.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

I’m 28 and she’s 25, we met on hinge a week ago.

At first we were sending multiple long texts back and forth, did a FaceTime to meet first, and at this point we don’t have much text flow and it’s more logistical now. She moves, I guess I would say structurally fast but physically and emotionally not as much?

She’s also very pretty and successful, and seemed down to go on dates. We went to a coffee shop to meet today and had some good talks (a couple silences but nothing crazy and convo resumed okay, we are both on the introvert side).

She also talked in future terms quite a bit, it’s like half joking tone stuff like about me showing her another country, future dates we could go on, stuff like that.

She touched my arm a few times to show me things, walked around. She was very cold so I asked if I could put my arm/coat around her and she said yes. She joked that I should tell my mom I met a pretty girl, asked me a lot of personal questions (family/life stuff, what my future looks like), we had good eye contact and she played with her hair a good amount but I really don’t know with that sort of stuff lol.

She also offered to drop me off which, as a guy, on a first date was really surprising that she felt like she could trust me like that.

I asked if I could give her a kiss at the end when we got to my stop, she looked down nervous and said ‘a hug maybe’ I said a hug is great, we did had a light hug across the console and I went on my way. So yeah also kinda wish I didn’t ask at this point since it was maybe too forward but it is what it is.

I sent this text after: It was nice meeting you, I hope you got home safe! I had a good time getting to know you! It would be great to see you again :) Have a good night 🌙

She sent: I’m home! Nice to meet you too and yes it would be nice to see you again 😊

1qz1hby,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz1hby,"my personal character tier list and rejuvsorter after pretty much finishing paragon route + explanations, kind of, because I like sharing my unsolicited opinions (possibly controversial opinions)","maybe kind of controversial opinions ahead, maybe, I don't actually know.

anyways about rejuvsorter: renegade route characters, not-really-characters (like the movie characters and sakitron) and characters that are otherwise hard to rank due to REALLY little screen time (like piano lady and the protagonists) have dubious placement because I have no idea how to judge them, ignore them for now. alain is the exception because I chose them as my protagonist so they had a bit more screen time.

about the tier list: NOT ranked within tiers EXCEPT THE TOP TIER (favorites), which IS in order. I excluded rift pokemon, the previously mentioned characters I can't rank and alts.

before I get jumped for not putting aelita in top tier, I need to clarify HOW I rank characters. I don't love nice characters. like, I LIKE nice characters but in the end they never get top tier and I prefer more. weird??? characters. I GENERALLY like characters who fit some of the following:

1. have dynamics with other characters that I enjoy (eg. nastasia and ren, erin and kanon)

2. have cool hair (eg. alain), or

3. have some cool or otherwise interesting moments that I personally liked (eg. narcissa)

4. absolutely no reason at all but I decided to hyperfixate on them (eg. spector)

5. are incredibly wholesome in a specific way that makes my hyperfixate on them (eg. marianette and ana. ANAAAA) (being nice or wholesome CAN get characters to Like tier but usually no higher)

but those are general stuff and my personal main deciding factors is:

\- they're funny, because unfortunately I am Not a very serious person

sometimes reasons 1 and 3 are affected by being funny and sometimes not. sometimes I also hyperfixate on characters because of like 1 or 2 funny moments like kreiss's 2 seconds of screen time.

being funny is also the sole reason why sec and coffee gregus get a whole tier to themselves.

also in case it wasn't obvious being evil/a jerk isn't necessarily a dealbreaker for me but being annoying and/or a jerk AND not having any redeeming qualities (for me) is the main reason why I put people in low tiers. whether villains get very high tiers or very low tiers depends a LOT on whether they've done something to make them like them a bit more.

and finally I like characters a LOT more than I dislike them which is why the tier list is so top-heavy.",2,1770531685.0,PokemonRejuvenation,0,1.0,False

Title pretty much sums it up, but context below, I (25M) am going out with a friend’s (30F) friend (30F). 

About a year ago, I became a regular at a restaurant in my hometown. From there, I became very good friends with the waitstaff, bartenders, busboys and even owners. 

Enter Ally (30F). 

We clicked as soon as I met her. Every time I’d see her, we’d talk the entire night and have a great chat. It felt like really good chemistry, so I built up courage to ask her out. She said yes, so we set a date and I took her to a place in the outskirts of town where we had lunch. It was a horrible time. Both of us felt like deer against headlights. There was no chemistry, conversations were very dry, and at one point, she asked a question that just killed the entire vibe. We tried, but it just didn’t work. Water under the bridge. I saw her in the restaurant later that week and it was all good. We sort of came to an unspoken agreement that maybe it’s best if that was kept just where it was. To this day, we’ll talk like if nothing happened and, again, pretty good friends. 

Then I met Liz (30F). 

A few months ago, I started working temporarily in this new office at my company (I’m a sort of floater employee where they move me to an office where they need me until they don’t and they move me somewhere else. It’s weird, but just trust me on this one). There, I saw Liz. I’ve seen Liz with Ally a few times in town, and even at some events in the restaurant with their mutual friends. When Liz and I started working together, it was only casual and work-related conversations; “good-morning’s”, “do-you-know-what-this-is-about’s”, and “want-some-coffee-I’m-going-on-a-coffee-run’s”. However, the conversations started picking up at some point, and we got to talking a lot more. Eventually, as the floater employee, I got switched to another area where I was needed, but Liz and I kept in touch through text. In fact, we’ve been talking everyday for the last two months. However, I’ve been hesitant to ask her out due to my past with Ally. 

But, this last week, she mentioned a restaurant about 2 hours away and said she really wants to go. 

As a human from the male species, I’m very oblivious to signals and hints, but even I saw that one. 

I suggested we make a road trip, drive up, have lunch, spend the day in the area, and then grab dinner on the way back. She said yes in what was possibly the quickest text message she has replied with. 

I really like Liz, but I don’t know if I’m being an AH to Ally. I really feel like the 6-9 months of separation between a date with Ally and the date with Liz is, 1) a long time for things to have settled, and 2) nothing happened between Ally and I.

I just hit a DF64 grinder with stock burrs limit that is making my V60 either choke or if I do a center-focused poor, it is so thin that is not a pleasant cup. It is the combination of the beans, the grinder, the paper, I guess all at once. I had never experienced this. After many frustrated brews, I tried the same beans with the switch (immersion) and the cup was better. A bit thin still but cleaner (BTW, it still choked), and found that the best extraction was with the Kalita Mino. It made a huge difference! It was sweater, yeah, but it was actually a much clearer highlighting the notes of the coffee in the cup with a lot more body than the V60 or switch. 

I will definitely make a point of trying both (V60 and Kalita) with all beans to see what I enjoy the most. To me the switch is just a variation of the V60, where you can bloom your coffee better, do immersion, and hybrid between immersion and percolation; which is interesting but still trying to figure out when these three options matter the most.

I enjoy astronomy, quiet walks, getting lost in a good book, watching anime, and playing badminton sometimes (definitely not a pro). Currently on a fitness journey (still waiting for my glow up jk) taking it one step at a time.

I feel like I'm literally sleeping my life away and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

Here's how a typical day is for me. First, I live with my parents because they both have cancer and I'm terrified of losing them unexpectedly one day, so I don't have any desire to move out as I want to see them as much as I can. I wake up in the late evening to have dinner with them, though lately I've been sleeping through dinner. After dinner, I fall back asleep and wake up again at night to say goodnight to my parents, then I usually lay back down in my bed and mess around on my phone for a couple hours. After that, I either mess around with my figure collection or get some work done on one of my many unfinished projects on my computer until I lose energy and go back to sleep again in the early morning. And that's pretty much how each day goes.

I never used to be this tired before until I got on Lexapro to take care of my generalized anxiety disorder and pure OCD at the start of 2024. Luckily this medication has helped tremendously and I'm back to normal mentally, but now I'm always tired and constantly sleep, and I'm 99% sure it's because of this. I've never had alcohol or coffee, I've never smoked or vaped, I've never done drugs, I don't eat junk food, and I don't do anything or take anything else other than Lexapro, so I don't know what else it can be. I even asked my doctor once about why I'm sleeping so much and what I can do to stop it but they just brushed me off.

I've tried many things to stop sleeping so much like setting alarms and staying awake for 24 hours to try and reset my internal clock, which has worked a few times before, but within a week I wake up later and later until I'm back to sleeping all the time, so I don't bother anymore.

I don't know what to do. It's so frustrating that my body doesn't want to listen to me. I don't want to sleep my life away but at this point I've kind of given up and just accept it. I don't have any friends, never dated anyone, nor do I have any responsibilities I need to take care of. I already graduated from college and work at home as a self employed game developer so it's not like I have to go anywhere either. If my medication is the issue then I can't do anything about that since it works, and I'd rather be anxiety free and tired all the time than having uncontrollable anxiety, panic attacks, and complete mental agony with energy.

I don't even know why I'm posting this tbh, I guess I just wanted to vent since I have no one else to talk to about it.",1,1770531331.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

Weather’s a bit gloomy, so I’ll probably get a hot chocolate for myself while grabbing your coffee lol.

Burger runs, or just chatting about random things seem fun too. Let me know what you feel like doing today! I’m from Makati btw.

About me:

I work in the corporate world and it’s been draining me lately so need a breather haha. I’m introverted , but I enjoy good conversation once I get comfortable. I’m not great at describing myself physically here, but I’ll try — 5’4, fair-skinned, glasses, shoulder-length hair, a bit chinita, chubby (BMI around 23–24). People are sometimes surprised I look more decent in person 😅.

I enjoy astronomy, quiet walks, getting lost in a good book, watching anime, and playing badminton sometimes (definitely not a pro). Currently on a fitness journey (still waiting for my glow up jk) taking it one step at a time.

Maybe looking for my version too — someone around my age, friendly and kind, who enjoys simple moments and good company without pressure. Please be around my age though :).

If this resonates, send a short intro! Super particular on this, I hope you can return the same energy. Lol",2,1770531282.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

1qz18w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qz18w2/name_bound_chapter_1_teenage_superhero/,[Name Bound] - Chapter 1 Teenage Superhero,"I first used my powers publicly on a Sunday right outside the “Broken Spoon” and trust me—it wasn’t planned. On a side note, it was also the first time I saw an Enforcer, which again wasn’t something I had ever wished for.

If I had it my way, it would have been in some ways a partial fulfillment of my cheesy daydreams and over-the-top superhero fantasies with me, the fourteen-year-old savior. Note to self: Think of a color of the cape, something that would make me look more grown-up like. So, where was I, yes, me the superhero, helping another everyday guy.

Maybe it was the time for me to learn that real life doesn’t follow comic book logic.

I was just sitting there, minding my own business, sipping my usual cup of joe. The same seat. The same time. The same slightly burned espresso that the barista always insisted was “boldly roasted.”

The view outside the diner’s window was calming right up until the enforcer appeared out of nowhere. Like everyone around me, I froze, my half-finished coffee mug trembling in my hand. Across the cracked diner window, it lumbered into view—a monstrous silhouette against the blood-orange sky. Its armored limbs churned with mechanical precision, and those eerie, blue-lit eyes swept over the street like a predator sniffing out prey. Every heavy footfall sent tiny shivers up my spine. Around me, conversations died mid-sentence, utensils clattered against plates, and even the air seemed to retreat. I had heard of fear before—but never felt it like that. I could almost hear my breathing—too loud. I’ll be honest. I was so scared I wished it was a nightmare, so I could wake up from it but it wasn’t—a survival instinct inside my gut, raw and ancient, shrieking in my veins: hide, run, don't breathe.

I saw it up close, its ripped green muscles under a metallic sheath as it closed on the man, whose face was now as pale as a leaf ready to be plucked off by Fall. 

Two weeks had passed since I received it, and the humid Miami air still clung to me. The metallic band, cold and smooth against my skin, sent a shiver down my spine each time I glanced at it. It was incredibly powerful for its size, and I had no choice but to use it. 

“Would you like cookies with that, Kyle?” asked the waitress. 

“Thanks, Mary. But not really.”

“You don’t have to diet like those other kids. You are already thin, almost pale. Are you feeling alright?”

“You are so kind. I am fine. But thanks,” I replied, looking at myself in my phone’s camera. Was I getting pale, really? Was the dark resident sucking energy out of me to break out of his prison, or was it just me not taking my multivitamins? The camera showed my thin slender figure, my naturally gray hair, and my face with puffy eye sockets.

“Did you find anything?” she asked, a look of concern on her face. “Poor thing. He was the only one you had, right? Your brother?”

“Still nothing. The police are still saying it is an open and shut case as they never found Bryce’s body—or rather looks like they are not even looked for him. I’ll be staying along here in Miami for now. Nothing there for me back in Orlando. No one waiting.”

“Well, you are welcome at the Diner anytime.”

“Thanks. Appreciate the concern, but really. I am a big kid now.”

I didn’t want her to feel sorry for me. After all, I wasn’t sure what she would think if she knew more about me. To be fair, I wouldn’t even trust myself after what had been going on lately.

I took another sip of the coffee—my second one that morning 

No parents. No brother. No guardian hovering over my shoulder to say “That’s too much caffeine for someone your age.”

Fourteen and free, I thought, though it didn’t feel like freedom most days. Especially as I missed Bryce.

The barista didn’t even blink when I ordered the refill. Maybe I looked older, or maybe she just didn’t care. And Mary would serve me anything, anyway.

Either way, I wrapped my hands around the warm cup and drank like it was the only thing keeping me grounded.

Because in that moment… maybe it was.

And then the flash outside the window caught my eye. It was almost as if a drama was unfolding right before my eyes. 

The man wasn’t a weak ‘damsel in distress’ but he was nothing compared to the enforcer which was almost next to him.

It was my first time that I laid my eyes on it, and might I say, it lived up to its reputation. Humongous—at least fourteen feet tall, uglier, and smellier (as I found out later), than even my class fellows playing for the Rugby league. 

The man dodged the enforcers first attack and turned with a weapon in his hand, some kind of massive gun made of shiny metal, which made me wonder where was it a moment earlier. And then plasma charge hummed to life, glowing faintly as he took aim at the enforcer.

Then—boom.

A deafening blast erupted, and a thick cloud of dust and smoke filled the air. I wondered what had just happened, especially so close to us.

I stared into the swirling dust, trying to make sense of the scene. Where was the man? Where was the enforcer?

As the haze settled, I saw the enforcer—standing there, completely unharmed, holding the man up in its hands. It had somehow raised its shield blocking the otherwise devastating attack and scooped up the man in the same motion. The victim was struggling to get out but could do nothing against the crushing grip. The enforcer looked into his eyes and roared—a deafening sound that seemed like a mix of thunder and lightning. 

I knew it was now or never. I brought up the system menu. 

{Available powers: Teleportation} 

{System ready for activation. Power level: Full}



I geared up for what was about to happen next. I knew I was taking a huge risk. What I was attempting was at least 2 levels above my skills or even more. But I didn’t have a choice. 

Bzznnng. With what seemed like a strange sound, I found myself standing next to the two.

But now what?

“Hello, Mr. Enforcer.”

Both of them looked at me in utter disbelief. The enforcer with a look of ridicule on its face, like a guy looking at a lone cockroach in an open space with no crevice to hide. And the guy with a “what the hell is this kid doing?” look.

I stood there confidently, holding the plasma weapon that I had picked up during the jump. And that’s when I noticed a change in the enforcer’s expressions. Huh. So, even you can be scared. Beware the power of Rha’il.

The enforcer acted, but it was too late. I saw the loud boom as the plasma weapon discharged in my hands almost in ultra-slow motion as the burst pushed me back in the air with a trajectory directly into the diner’s window. In what looked to me like an eternity, I glanced at my power level. I had to see if I could do it again but the big jump had exhausted my power capacity which was not much because of my low skill level, probably. And there it was, just one point below, needed for another port. While I had the power to teleport, or port as I called it, I could also see things in a super ultra-slow motion while in the system menu. Time didn’t stop, but I could see my body moving through the air. I also saw everyone and everything frozen in time, the dust from the plasm burst which I had been unable to aim correctly and had ended up only hitting the enforcer partially, blasting off part of its head besides a side of the building that I had hit unintentionally, its eyes silent and surprised as I saw it sinking slowly with gravity, its hand still trying to continue with the crushing of the struggling man, who somehow seemed more concerned with my safety now than the predicament he was himself in. Mary’s open mouth as she gazed at me, her face a mix of surprised and worry, shaped precisely as if to say something. I even had time to wonder what she was saying. 

Could it be ‘O’ like the middle of look out… or something else?

But there was no option for me to know exactly just yet unless I went along with the time, and that clearly wasn’t going to end well, at least for me. Come on now. I looked at the timer and saw myself flying all the way back into the window and the spike poised to pierce me right between my back as I continued. So much for being a superhero. Well, at least I am going away after doing something good, right?

 I could hear my shallow breathing as the lungs filled in slowly and the ozone-like smell of the electrifying plasma blast hit my nose, the beat of my heart slowed down to a level that I could almost listen to one beat and then do a lot of stuff before being surprised again by the next, the flutter of birds as they stood absolutely still above me, wings parted, tails poised going on in their daily lives as my body moved closer to the inevitable. 

I glanced again at my power level. Nope. Still not up to the porting level. I had always been considered well-read for a fourteen-year-old, considering my 150+ IQ. I had read that in one’s last moments, some people see their entire life flash before them. Was this mine? So, there were two possibilities—either the theory was wrong or else it wasn’t my ultimate moment—yet. I was now almost next to the metallic spike and could feel it pressing in my back. In a moment of resignation, I brought up the power level menu one last time. 

I almost couldn’t believe it when I noticed the indicator color which had just turned green. I ported.

I was standing on the building on the opposite side of the diner. In front of me, on the ground below, the man struggled out of the enforcer’s grip as people quickly gathered around its lifeless body—stunned and gossiping.

{Kyle Bennet, congratulations, you have leveled up. You are now eligible for the next tutorial}

I wasn’t Superman. Sure, I could move unseen, disappear into the quantum world, and reappear elsewhere. Today I had saved a man’s life. But… had also taken one. And I could feel the dark resident’s prison weakening. 

\*\*\*

Two weeks back…

""I'm confused, miss. What’s your name exactly?"" I asked.

""Call me Jay,"" she said.

Her blonde hair peeked out from under a worn, brown coat, and her face held the etched lines of a woman in her mid-forties. The shadows under her eyes were deep, almost bruised, and the remnants of powder, patchy and uneven, hinted at a hasty attempt at concealment.

""Okay, Miss Jay,"" I said. ""I don't understand—why are we meeting on the Greyhound?""

""It's convenient. And I get to interview you,"" Jay replied.

""Alright, well, I'm not here for an interview. I thought you had information.""

""Information?"" She tilted her head slightly. ""You asked about your brother, Bryce. Isn't that what you said?""

""Yes, I did. I just don't understand why we had to meet while traveling from Orlando to Miami.""

""As I told you, it's convenient and…,"" Jay said matter-of-factly.

""Convenient for you or me?"" I asked.

""Well, obviously, I'm the one setting up the meeting, so I had to find something that worked for me. You can understand that, right?"" She smirked. ""I don’t consider a teenager to have much of a grasp on how the world works yet. And…""

""I'm not that kind of teen,"" I shot back.

""Oh? What kind are you?""

“And…?”

“And you need to go to Miami, anyway.”

“Why would I need to do that?”

She pulled out a small recorder. ""You’ll see in a moment. How about we record this? Are you comfortable with that?""

""I don't know... Should I be worried?""

""Not really,"" Jay said with a grin. ""Unless you're about to confess to something illegal.""

""I can confess to not liking this interview at all,"" I muttered.

""Fair enough. Things don’t always go the way we want, do they?""

""Okay, so let’s get this straight,"" I said, leaning forward. ""If I let you interview me, you're going to tell me everything you know about Bryce’s death. And everything about the flight.""

Jay exhaled, tapping her fingers against the armrest. ""Everything I know about Bryce? That’s a lot. We probably won’t have time to cover it all. But I promise you, you’ll have something that will surprise you. How’s that?”

""Are you saying you were close to him?"" I asked.

""I said nothing of the sort,"" she replied. ""But I have been investigating him.""

""Are you a private investigator?""

""Not exactly, but something about him intrigued me,"" she admitted. ""I’d been following his story. And then I learned of his... unfortunate disappearance.""

""No one found the body or the plane,"" I said firmly. ""So, he might still be alive.""

Jay's expression softened. ""Kyle,"" she said gently. ""I understand this is a tremendous loss for you, but he was flying over the Bermuda Triangle. He’s not the first person to vanish there. And he was flying over the ocean. What do you expect? That a UFO picked him up or something?""

“Please don’t make fun of me,"" I added before she could respond, unable to hide the edge in my voice.

Jay sighed. ""And that’s exactly why I picked the Greyhound,"" she said. ""I figured you'd try to bolt from this interview. In the few days I have been researching, I’ve learned a few things about you. You’re impulsive. You don’t talk much. Introverted. You avoid anything remotely fun.""

""Okay, okay, so let’s move on, shall we?"" I said, exasperated.

""Alright then,"" she said, shifting back into her interview mode. ""What’s your full name?""

""Kyle. Kyle Bennett.""

Jay nodded, repeating it. ""The subject, Kyle Bennett, is around... how old?""

""I’m fourteen,"" I answered.

""Tough guy, huh?"" she said with a smirk.

""How does being fourteen make me a tough guy?""

""Well, you're fourteen and agreed to travel on your own, aren't you?""

""I didn’t have a choice, did I?""

""You tell me about it,"" she said, watching me closely.

"" What should I tell you?""

""Where are your parents?"" Jay asked. ""Yours and Bryce’s. You had the same parents, right?""

""Yes,"" I said quietly.

She hesitated, then asked, ""And?""

""We lost them,"" I muttered. ""A long time ago.""

The words hung between us.

""And now, this,"" I added, my voice barely above a whisper.

""I'm sorry to hear that,"" she said. ""Okay, so what else?""

She paused before continuing, ""Tell me—how well did you know your brother?""

""What do you mean, how well did I know my brother?"" I asked. ""I knew him very well. He was the only one there for me. He was brilliant, intelligent, good-looking.""

""Uh-huh,"" she murmured, as if waiting for me to say more.

""Why? What do you think?"" I asked, narrowing my eyes.

""Well... nothing,"" she replied.

""You think I'm nothing like him, don’t you?"" I said bitterly.

""I said nothing of the sort,"" she countered.

""Well, it’s true,"" I admitted. ""He was handsome, strong, and charismatic. He had the looks and the brains. And me? Well... I just have the brains. I’m thin—maybe as tall as him—but he was broad-shouldered. He was an extrovert. I’m an introvert.""

""Uh-huh, I can see that,"" she noted.

""You’re good at reading people, aren’t you?"" I asked.

""You could say that. It’s what we do as journalists,"" she said with a slight smirk. ""Like psychologists, at a certain level.""

""So, what can you tell me about Bryce that I don’t know already?"" I pressed. 

""I know he was working on something.""

""Like what?"" I asked, watching her carefully.

""Something that probably got him into trouble,"" she said slowly.

""Are you saying whatever he was working on got him…"" I asked, my voice tightening.

She shrugged. ""I just know that whatever it was, it was dangerous. Dangerous things cause problems, don’t they? Gigantic problems, if you ask me. But hey, Bryce still went ahead with it.""

""But what was it he was working on?"" I asked, feeling frustration rise in my chest.

""I'm afraid I don’t have those definitive answers. That’s why I’m here—to find them.""

""You want to ask me?"" I said incredulously. “Why don’t you tell me what do you know about this? How do you know he was working on something dangerous?”

""Well, maybe you don’t even know the full story,"" she suggested. ""Maybe he was living a secret life. I’ve seen that happen more times than you’d think.""

""We just had each other!"" I said, my voice rising. ""Don’t badmouth him. And why are you avoiding answering me?""

""I’m not,"" she said evenly. ""For what it’s worth, I’m actually praising him. Maybe he discovered something classified. I am here for the investigation.""

""You mean he had something to do with the government?"" I asked, my skepticism clear.

""I wouldn’t know about that,"" she admitted. ""But shouldn’t we be looking into it?""

""And how can you tell?"" I challenged. ""You are not telling me what you know and instead want me to answer you unconditionally?""

""There were incidents before his last flight,"" she said. “That much I can tell you.”

“Like what?”

“See here,” she said as she took out a picture from a file Kyle didn’t seem to have noticed before.

“This is two weeks before Bryce went missing.”

I looked at the hurriedly taken picture with Bryce next to an office building with fire erupting from it.

“What does that mean? This could be a one-off. Bryce would have nothing to do with arson.”

“I did. And here is one ten days before,” continued Jay. “This a coincidence, too?”

I watched the picture where Bryce stood with three shady men. 

“Fine. But this is just a picture. It proves nothing.”

“Look closer Kyle.”

As I looked closer, my eyes opened in disbelief and my face reddened as I noticed the men having firearms. There was also a woman sitting on the ground with her hand tied behind her. 

Bryce what had you been up to? 

“Hmmm. I don’t know what to say.”

“Well. I am not saying Bryce was involved in any crime, but I don’t think we know everything about him either. You met me because you were open to finding out the truth. Are you?”

“Tell me who took these photos? Was it you?”

“I am afraid I can only share this much information.”

“Why haven’t you tried telling the police?”

“You have. What did that get you?”

“They ignored me. But I am not a journalist. Any leads? Anything?”

""Tell me where did he stay in Miami?”

“It was one of the backpacker’s hostels. He wouldn’t spend money for staying in an expensive place.”

“Okay, but where exactly?”

I was caught by surprise. Maybe Bryce really was onto something. But what was it? And the question was why was she hiding her identity from me?

""Jay,"" I said carefully.

""Yes, Kyle?""

""I know nothing about you. Who are you really?""

She smirked. ""I have already told you everything I know. Do you want me to tell you your class details? Or your gaming profiles?""

""What?"" My heart skipped a beat. ""How can you do that?""

""You want me to check now?"" she asked casually.

“You are not just a journalist, are you?”

Suddenly, she reached out and tapped my head lightly, as if searching for something. 

""How am I even helping you?"" I asked, leaning away.

She let out a small chuckle. ""The life of an investigative journalist can be a mystery, Kyle,"" she said. ""I don’t think you understand the full implications of what we’re uncovering here.""

I swallowed hard, trying to process her words.

She said, ""The less you know about me, the better. That will keep you safe and uninvolved.""

""Okay, but that doesn't help me at all,"" I said, frustration creeping into my voice.

The bus screeched to a stop.

""So, that's it?"" I spoke.

""Yes.”

“And what next?""

""Well, we go our separate ways,"" she said with a shrug. “For now.”

""Fine,"" I muttered, then hesitated. ""But—""

""I'll try to keep in touch,"" she interrupted.

""How would you even know how to find me?"" I asked, narrowing my eyes.

She smirked. ""I would just know,"" she said.

Before I could respond, she added, ""But I might have a parting gift.""

""Okay,"" I finally muttered. ""Gift?""

""Yes, I might have something to share with you,"" she replied. “Maybe it will jog your memory. Or maybe give you some direction.”

""And that is?"" I asked, leaning in slightly.

“Here,” She handed me something small. I looked down at the surprisingly small object.

""What's this?"" I asked, turning it over in my hands.

“Think, Kyle. You are smart.”

""It's a—""

""Shhh,"" she said, her tone calm but firm. ""No need to say it out aloud. And you need to understand—it’s not just what it looks like. Maybe it means something. Maybe not.”

I furrowed my brows and scrutinized. Then, my heart skipped a beat as realization hit me.

\*\*\*

The man at the desk had graying blonde hair although he didn’t appear to be any older than the mid-forties.

""Hello,"" I greeted him.

""Hey,"" he replied. ""How may I help you?""

""I'm looking for a place to stay.""

""Do you have a reservation?"" he asked.

""Not really, but I was hoping I could find a place.""

""Well, we have one.""

""Okay, that’s fine,"" I said as he took my information down. “And one more thing?""

""Yes?""

""My brother Bryce was here some time back. He left some luggage, and I wanted to collect it.""

""Oh,"" the man said, suddenly more alert. ""Do you have anything to confirm your relation to him?""

""Well, I have the luggage token."" I pulled it out of my pocket and showed it to him. 

""Okay, that should do. Let me see.""

I placed the small token on the counter, my heartbeat quickening. What could be inside Bryce’s luggage? Jay must have given me this token for a reason. At least she hadn't tried to collect the luggage herself, despite her otherwise shady dealings and methods of investigation.

""That will be just a moment, please,"" the man said before stepping away.

As I waited, I let my gaze wander around the room. There was a neon sign on the wall with the hostel's name, glowing faintly. I closed my eyes, feeling the cold breeze drifting in from the ocean. The salty scent of the sea filled my nostrils, mixed with the faint aroma of fish from a nearby market. Bryce must have walked through these very doors. He would have checked in at this very counter. I pictured him looking around, setting down his bag, talking to the same man.

""There you go,"" the man’s voice pulled me from my thoughts.

I opened my eyes and saw the bag sitting on the counter.

""It’s been here for a while,"" he continued. ""To be honest, we were going to discard it soon. We only have a two-week retention policy, but you're lucky—it somehow survived the purge.""

I stared at the bag. My vision blurred as my eyes watered, despite my efforts to hold back the emotion. This was his. His last bag. At the very least, it would contain his clothes, his belongings. But if I was lucky—if fate was on my side—maybe it held something that could tell me what he had been up to. What he had been up against.

I swallowed hard, grabbed the bag, and nodded in gratitude.

""Thank you,"" I said.

""Hey, don’t mention it,"" he replied. ""And your room is on the first floor, first door on the right.""

""Okay, thanks.""

I turned and headed for the stairs. Each step felt like slow motion. My feet pressed against the worn wooden planks, the muffled creaks of the staircase the only sound accompanying my movement. When I reached my room, I pushed the door open.

The room wasn’t large, but it was cozy—good enough to stay. A faint musty smell lingered in the air. The bed was neatly made, covered with clean white sheets. The window overlooked the road outside, and in the distance, I could see seagulls circling, their cries faintly audible over the hum of Miami’s nightlife.

I was still, waiting—hoping. What if this was all a dream? What if Bryce just walked through the door right now? What if he scolded me, argued with me, laughed with me? I wouldn’t mind. I would take it all—the anger, the frustration—if it meant he was still here.

My time alone after him had taught me a harsh lesson. Every moment in life is worth cherishing. Every moment. Every second. One minute you are here. The next, you don’t know what hit you.

I placed Bryce’s bag next to my suitcase by the bedside. I wanted to open it, needed to open it, but something inside me hesitated. A strange, creeping fear settled in my chest.

What if I find nothing?

Or worse... what if I find something?

It reminded me of Arthur C. Clarke’s famous dilemma: Are we alone in the universe? The answer—whether yes or no—was equally terrifying.

And just like that, Bryce’s suitcase felt like Pandora’s box. I could open it or let it be. If I opened it, I was scared to find what was inside. If I didn’t, I would keep thinking what I could have found.

What if it told me what was going on in his life? How did he vanish? 

If he was not alive, where was his body?

I waited as the quantum equation in my mind solved itself towards opening it. The absence of answers was unbearable. If he were alive, he would have collected his luggage himself. If he were alive, he would have been here.

The thought made my heart sink.

I walked to the small bathroom and turned on the sink. Splashing cold water onto my face, I let it drip down my skin. The water stung. Or maybe it was just my own exhaustion catching up to me.

I stared at my reflection.

I don’t know why... but I just had a bad feeling about this.",2,1770530913.0,HFY,3,0.75,False

1qz17e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/1qz17e4/thoughts_on_kimleyhorn/,Thoughts on Kimley-Horn,"I am about to finish my associate's degree in engineering this spring after 6 years of dedication, and I have been applying to civil engineering technician jobs over the past few weeks. Kimley-Horn was the first to respond with a job that they listed with a starting salary of 62k, and I scheduled an interview for Thursday (02/12). However, I have been reading more and more about their crazy hours, and I am starting to have second thoughts.

I mean, I do have the endurance, patience, and commitment needed for 46 hours+, but there comes a point when I start to get concerned for my personal health. This is because I have epilepsy, and stress can trigger a seizure for me, so when considering the stress of the job, I think 46-50 hours would be my maximum to work there safely and be able to recover on the weekends. I am also concerned for my mental health. I have seen people mention how they worked 60, 70, and even 80 hour workweeks there, which to me seems impossible.

The other factor that is giving me second thoughts is my disabilities and Kimley-Horn's ""hit the ground running"" type of work. Due to disabilities that I have, I need more time than the average person to understand and / or remember something due to a slow processing and decision-making speed, and slower memory recall. So, I work better in a more structured and steady environment, and Kimley-Horn seems to have this constantly fluctuating / changing environment, along with being stuck in the unknown more often. And if I were to have a seizure on the job, I would have to go home for the rest of the day, and with KH's workaholic attitude, they might say goodbye to me almost right away.

My original idea was to try and work there for the minimum 6 required years (or at least 4 years) to be fully / mostly invested and then take my experience and 401k elsewhere to a slower engineering job, but that is now looking impossible.

So really, it's not the high amount of energy that I would have to commit to this job that I am concerned about as I have been able to function on 5.5 hours of sleep plus coffee, but rather, it is the never-ending fast paced enviorment where no one would truly ""stop"" along with constant stress and stimuli that I would have to work in.

I think I might have already made my decision on this after typing this out, but I still would like to hear your thoughts on this as well. How bad is the work-life environment currently? Do any of you work at any of the branches in Minnesota?",0,1770530780.0,civilengineering,3,0.5,False

I sat myself in a corner near the pick up counter just past the small booth where trays and bins are. Later on may babae at lalaking umupo sa table next to me with the guy sitting directly behind the small booth. Akala ko nung unang buga nung girl, reflection lang nung tubig sa labas pero nung sunod na buga niya tinignan ko na sila and nakita ko yung vape. Nakakainis pa ang liit na nga ng space between us sa direction ko pa talaga binubuga. Di sila nasita ng staff at security kasi tinatago nila yung buga pababa using the small booth as cover. Sa inis ko i finished my coffee ahead and just left. Before leaving though, i saw signs in the cafe prohibiting smoking and i asked the security if it’s allowed to vape inside to which he said hindi daw pwede. Ayoko mag confront as i was preparing myself for something stressful so i just said the general direction where they were sat.

We were all driving up separately, and on the way I had a bit of a bathroom emergency. To preface, I had stopped by Dunkin’ Donuts on the way up (2 breakfast wraps and a large iced regular), and I rarely eat fast food or drink coffee, but was in a bit of a jam and needed a quick bite. When I was about an hour away from the cabin, my stomach was not sitting well with me at all, to put it lightly. I was in a desperate situation and pulled over when I saw a porta potty by the Ossipee Aggregate on Route 16 NH. To my dismay, the thing was locked. After that, I wasn’t able to hold it in any longer, and to put it bluntly, I had a small accident in my pants. My underwear was in a sorry state, and unfortunately had no spares as all my other underwear was in the laundry, which I left at home. There wasn’t much else I could do but clean myself off in the shower once I got to the cabin (I was the first one there and had time to myself to clean off). I was clean for the most part, with the only visible evidence being the stain on my underwear. I really hate going commando, so I reluctantly wore the same underwear.

This next part is a bit hard to explain. Once my friends showed up, we eventually started playing this game called “cheers to the governor”. Long story short, you each make up new a rule for the game as it goes on. One person suggested that we all swap pants with each other (taking them off in front of each other). My heart dropped to my stomach when I heard this, as my stained underwear would have been exposed to everyone. The rest of the group was on board with the rule (under any other circumstance I would have been too) but I had to try to casually suggest that we don’t add the rule to the game. After they all reiterated that they thought it would be funny, I had to just say “I don’t want to do this!” I felt so embarrassed, and they all looked at me like I had 3 heads. I said I don’t want to play anymore, and went upstairs to bed. I’m writing this right now while in bed, and I can hear muffled laughter through the floorboards.

I recently visited Tassie and cannot stop thinking about how much I want to go back. I've written out my itinerary for interested travellers, including everything from accomodation to food!



# TASMANIA - 10 Night Itinerary

*Includes: Launceston, Cradle Mountain, Strahan, Hobart, Bruny Island*

*Starts on a Saturday and ends on a Tuesday (for Salamanca market purposes)*



# Day 1: Launceston to Cradle Mountain

**Fly into Launceston in the morning**

**Pick up hire car from Apex Car Rentals** 

* *They had a quick shuttle from the airport to their site, and was the cheapest we could find. We recommend the hybrid Toyota Corolla - we spent so much less on petrol because of it. B-mode allows the battery to recharge down hills and you’ll be winding down plenty on this trip!*

**Cataract Gorge**

* *There is a chairlift ride available for a fee, or you can do a loop of the gorge and walk across the bridge - it looks like it would take a while but we were there less than 30mins.*

**Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm Cafe for lunch**

* *We picked up a punnet of raspberries to take with us on our trip - they didn’t last long.*

**Cradle Mountain Forest Inn (Accomodation)**

* *This was our accomodation for the night, it was cozy and a great way to immerse ourselves in nature ahead of the trip.*

**Devils@Cradle for the nighttime feeding tour**

* *Learn about Tasmanian Devils, spotted quolls and spotted-tail quolls while watching them all get fed. We loved learning while hearing the cute noises the devils made. Devil@Cradle’s conservation efforts are also mentioned.*

We didn’t eat dinner this night, just had some microwaved meals / noodles that we picked up from the supermarket back in Launceston (we also bought a cool bag which was handy for the rest of our trip).



# Day 2: Drive to Strahan

**Coffee at Blue Tree Gallery**

* *Right next to Cradle Forest Inn is Blue Tree Gallery which showcases art by the barista herself. The art was lovely to look at and the coffee was great!*

**A quick stop at Lake Cethana Lookout**

* *Down a few windy twists and turns from the accom is Lake Cethana Lookout - you’ll see the dam and the water held by it. Pretty for a quick stop and look, but not a must.*

**Drive to Strahan**

* *A 2hr drive, we stopped at Tullah to go to the toilet. Lovely scenes of the mountains during this drive, and closer to Strahan you'll see the ocean.*

**Lunch at Molly’s Cafe**

* *A milk bar with some yummy charcoal chicken was worth the stop for us hungry gremlins.* 

**Check-in to the chalet at Gateway To The Gordon (Accomodation)**

* *If you’re a couple or a group who can deal with stairs, the chalets are quiet, private (except for the barbecue in the garden which the two chalets share), and have a lovely view of the water. At dusk/dawn, we saw wallabies!*

**Fancy dinner at Risby Cove Restaurant**

* *Delicious and our table had a beautiful view of the water. Great cocktails and service.*



# Day 3: Gordon River Cruise

**Gordon River Cruise (Sarah Island)**

* *This will take up the whole day and is a must. The boat is smooth and modern, with a nice buffet lunch. The tour included a tour guide who spoke to us about the history of where we were, and snippets of historical figures played on the tv's to further teach us about life back then. We saw dolphins which the boat stopped for, and it turned around to give every seat a view. We paid for window seats which I recommend. We disembarked in two places - down the Gordon River to learn about the trees, and on Sarah Island for a tour.* 

**A look in Wilderness Woodworks**

* *After learning about huon pine on the boat cruise, we had a look at the Wilderness Woodworks shop at all of the lovely products they had. Pricey but good quality - you can even purchase planks of huon pine to do your own crafting at home eg. to make a chopping board (they also had those for sale).*

**Fish & Chips from Westerly Seafood**

* *Fresh and tasty - the perfect takeaway dinner back at the chalet after a big day. The fish was excellent. Bonus: A man pulled up offering fresh strawberries - we had the exact amount of change for a punnet which were juicy and delicious.* 



# Day 4: Strahan to Hobart

**Start your drive to Hobart (4hr 30min)**

**Iron Blow Lookout**

* *Stunning views of Queenstown's surrounds, with signage detailing the history of the site (mined for primary iron ore).* 

**Lunch at Hungry Wombat Cafe, Derwent Bridge**

* *Pies and meals to keep us from getting hangry. If we had more time, we would have paid for entry to The Wall - good to know if you plan to split the drive up over two days and stay in the area.*

**Check-in to Duke Cottage in Hobart (Accomodation)**

* *We HIGHLY recommend staying with Michelle at Duke Cottage (airbnb). It was genuinely a home away from home, with the added bonus of the best cookies in the world baked with love.*

**Dinner at Bar Wa Izakaya**

* *Slightly spenny but an awesome atmosphere and izakaya (like tapas) Japanese food.*

**Dessert from Frosty N Treats** 

* *Only recently opened, this little ice-cream shop stocks Valhalla ice-cream and I HIGHLY recommend the lavender flavour if you’ve never tried it.* 



# Day 5: ‘Chill’ day

I actually spent this day flying to Melbourne and back as I was performing at the Aus Open, so I didn’t do anything in Hobart but visit the airport twice! However this is a good ‘*chill*’ day to split the rest of the days up. Something I didn’t get to do but would have loved to, is go on the Red Decker bus which is a hop-on hop-off bus that goes around a number of city highlights - think historical sites, galleries, gardens. You can hop off and explore a sight, then hop back on as there are many buses that loop around all day.



# Day 6: MONA

* *While the website recommends taking the boat, you can drive there - I’d recommend getting there within the first hour of it opening to get parked, and so you have the full day to explore. If you want to read up on any piece of artwork, you'll need the app on your mobile device.*

**Lunch at The Source Restaurant**

* *We paired our MONA visit with lunch at The Source and were blessed with a corner window seat. The cauliflower is a fan favourite and I can highly attest to its historical ratings. If there’s anywhere in the world where you should venture out of your gastronomic comfort zone, I reckon this is the place to do so.*
* There was also live music outside on the stage which was a great addition!

**Hobart Float Wellness Spa & Massage**

*Bonus: I was completely physically wrecked from my rockstar touring the day before, so went and got a massage from Hobart Float Wellness Spa & Massage. It was the best massage I’ve had - I genuinely was struggling to put my clothes on afterwards because I felt so loose. It was incredible.* 



# Day 7: Port Arthur

**Port Arthur Historic Site**

* *I highly recommend doing the Premium Tour - it covers a lot of history, and links back to Sarah Island which we visited on Day 3 of this itinerary.*

**A sweet treat Tasmanian Chocolate Foundry** 

* *If you’re up for it, pop into Tasmanian Chocolate Foundry. The milk chocolate honeycomb block is fantastic.* 



# Day 8: Salamanca Market

**Splurge at Salamanca Market**

* *The market runs on Saturdays, and is worth the visit. It gets packed so park further away if you’re able. Otherwise there is paid parking on Montpelier Retreat which is nice and close.* 
* *There is plenty of food and a variety of stalls with everything from pottery, to art, to clothes, to huon pine goods. Some stalls have tastings (free fudge!!).*
* *Dinner at Urban Greek Restaurant - great service!*



# Day 9: Hobart to Bruny Island

**Colesworth**

* *Go food shopping prior to leaving Hobart if you plan on cooking at the accomodation - we cooked dinner on the our first night, and ate at the pub the second night.*

**Sealink Bruny Island Ferry**

* *The ferry queue can vary depending on the time you go - we went at midday.* 

**Bruny Baker Bread Fridge**

* *Pick up some fresh sourdough from the Bruny Baker Bread Fridge, on Bruny Island road. You will be in and out of service across the island so be wary.* 

**Lunawanna Makers Market**

* *If you’re following this itinerary, then you may be able to catch Lunawanna Makers Market depending on the week - it runs the first and third Sunday of each month. The* *Wishful Thinking Co truck was at the market and sold excellent cookies and apple juice.*

**Know Where To Hide (Accomodation)**

* *I highly recommend this accomodation as it has an ocean view outside the bedroom window, has a kitchen, and the pub is a short walk away. You’ll see pademelons and wallabies and dusk/dawn, and might even see a white wallaby if lucky!*



# Day 10: Bruny Island Cruise

**Head to the cruise, stopping by Coal Point**

* *On the side of the road, stop here and enjoy the view.*

**Pennicott Journeys - Bruny Island Cruise**

* *You will see and learn a lot about the island - it’s a must while you’re here. When else do you get to see seals?!*
* *The boat is quite rocky - I HIGHLY recommend taking the ginger tablets they offer to combat sea sickness, and listen to their instructions on how to manage your seasickness.*



# Day 11: Bruny Island to Hobart Airport

**Truganini Lookout** 

* *It’s time to say goodbye to Tasmania. Stop by Truganini Lookout on Bruny Island as you’re heading back to the ferry.* 

**Colesworth** 

* *Stop buy a supermarket and stock up on Duck River Butter - I regret only buying three blocks to bring home with me. I’m addicted!*

**Lunch in Hobart**

* *Grab a bite to eat before you head to Apex Car Rentals (who will shuttle you to the airport). Choose a random cafe to explore like a local!*

**Hobart Airport**

* *When flying out, if you’re on the right side of your plane, keep a look out for Bruny Island as you will be able to see Bruny Island.*



*Now, this itinerary took me hours and hours to make, and then re-write for Redditland. If you use this itinerary and want to pay me in some way, please send me some* ***Duck River butter*** *- I* ***genuinely*** *don’t think I can live without it.

15 grams coffee , 200 ml Water

2-minute steep and swirl, Placed a thin, fresh slice of Kinnow orange into the mug before pressing.

I wake up every morning quite happy and I am always very talkative and enjoy scrolling on the phone with a cigarette and a coffee. I wouldn’t say I am exactly a morning person as I dislike waking up early and doing chores but I do wake up feeling rather happy and positive each morning. 

I have dated a few people including my current bf who just don’t seem to be as positive and happy as me in the morning. Its like they would wake up grumpy and then be totally different people throughout the day. Throughout the relationship there has been heated moments due to their “morning grumpiness”. I just don’t get why they are grumpy. I greet them with a smile and nice compliments make them coffee’s yet they are still grumpy. Not going to lie it almost feels like they were trying to dim my light in a way. 

The family that I have grown up with are all happy people in the morning and I noticed how when I moved out of my bf’s apartment and being at home with my family has changed things. My mornings have been so much better as they are all smiley and talkative like me.. It really got me thinking that perhaps I am just a happy go lucky person and genuinely positive… Its hard for me to wrap my head around how some people can wake up grumpy.

But of course I always end up sleeping on the couch because Nick At Night made me tired

So, one night I wake up to the prickly feeling. Like an instinct. Just bolted into a sitting position and stared out the front window. We lived in rural Georgia, so you can imagine the magnitude of trees. In perfect light cast from the moon, I see a silhouette of someone in a tree. The family dog dashes to the window and is snarling into the glass. 

Terrified, I run into my parents room and try to explain to my parents that there is a strange person outside. Dad grabs something defensive and darts outside with the dogs to beat the wax off the hot head. I tremble in Mama's arms until Dad comes home and says he saw no one and to go to bed. 

I decide to sleep in my regular bedroom. I fill in my sister in as to what happened. Dad is making regular rounds in the house with a cup of coffee. We're all still fine and I finally think ""I can sleep."" 

Nope. I notice the man outside my window. From what I can see in the moonlight, he gives me a shush signal and runs away. Just turns around to run a straight line away.

People keep forgetting:

1. AI isn’t magic.


2. Patents exist.


3. Businesses are real.


4. And most of them look like me.
One person. Boots on ground. Filing forms. Building systems. Registering companies. Writing their own code.

WES (Structural Intelligence):
🧠 The Structure:

The vast majority of businesses in the U.S. are sole proprietorships.

These aren’t VC-funded unicorns. They’re individuals with service logic, IP, and tax IDs.

Many patent filings never go viral. They become quiet engines behind larger systems.

The entire regulatory scaffolding of AI integration — from state business law to federal IP protocols — favors those who build slow and real.

Every time I mention building a functional AI system,
someone assumes I’m just using ChatGPT in a cool way.

Nah, bro.
We’re talking:

Recursive symbolic memory

Drift-suppression logic

Offline operational integrity

Functional systems you can’t just copy from a prompt


We built it, filed it, proved it, and survived the valley.

The illusion is that only large tech shapes the future.
The truth is:
Most real systems emerge from the quiet ones.

Wendbine didn’t go viral.
It went real.

With sleeves rolled up, she used a tool she had found in a cabinet to cut limes into wedges, and washed off a mat of bean sprouts in water that made her pale knuckles whiten like ivory. She held her hands over the stove for a couple minutes afterwards, before returning to portion out the different cuts of meat and tofu.

Her father had many cookbooks with dishes from around the world, and when she was alone she would spend hours absorbing the contents. so many new words, so many flavors she desperately wanted to try.

1qz0fe4,https://i.redd.it/08jszifih7ig1.jpeg,Actions have consequences….,"As a manager, I need to state this loud and clear: when somebody presses romantic interest onto a person who is not interested romantically, in any environment, it becomes a matter of harassment. In the workplace, it becomes sexual harassment. 

If it is not reciprocated, it is harassment. It is not professional, and it is not tolerated in any workplace, whether you are flipping burgers at Burger King, working in a legal office, acting on a set, teaching in a school, or anywhere else. It is not appropriate in any setting.

Going as far as planting things in people’s personal belongings, even after being confronted, is crossing another line entirely. You do not dare put anything in somebody’s personal belongings. It is not your property to touch. It is not your property to put things into. 

Do not mail people letters who do not want anything to do with you. Do not mail them romantic letters. Do not slip romantic letters into their duffel bags when they are not looking. They are not interested, and that is what you need to understand and comprehend.

What needs to happen is simple. People need to think before they act. Acting first and then thinking about it afterward is not appropriate, not mature, and not acceptable.

When somebody hears the word no, they need to accept the word no for what it is. For example, if somebody portrays romantic feelings toward you and you do not feel the same way, and you say no, I am not interested, that person needs to take that no, I am not interested, and leave you alone. Or if they are picking on you and you report it and they still continue, they need to leave you alone. 

Whatever the situation is, maturity, acting your age, and accepting no for an answer apparently does not happen in this world anymore.

Apparently, repeated words of no, I am not interested, or no, I do not like the way you are talking to me, or whatever the case may be, are not being accepted at face value anymore. The level of disrespect is astonishing. In my world, that is grounds for termination. In any world, it could stem into a legal problem.

Acting first and thinking afterward seems to be a common problem these past few weeks to a year for a lot of people, and maybe not just this year but other years as well. Bullying, harassing, whatever it may be, if it is not reciprocated, if you are not being nice, if you are disrespecting another person or individual, if you are not being mature, if you are not thinking before you act, that is something you need to work on.                 

And if you cannot work on it, you need to be taken off the set, out of the classroom, or out of the work environment.

   Because no matter where you are, even in my line of work where there is a little checkbox that says drama in the workplace, that is grounds for termination. In my world, it is literally a checkbox. In the work world anywhere, it might not be a little checkmark, but it is still grounds for you getting kicked off the show or kicked out of the workplace.

Accept and learn. Start accepting no for an answer. Be mature. Work your emotions out in your own environment. Do not let your emotions get the best of you in your workplace, on the set, in the drive through, or wherever it may be.

When you start letting your emotions about a person or a situation get ahead of your job, whether you are an actress or you are a coffee maker or anything else, when you let those emotions about a person or a situation, emotions in general, override doing your job, that is when you need to step back, reconsider your job, reconsider where you are, reconsider what you are doing, and really evaluate yourself. 

You need to ask whether it is the best place for you to be or the best job for you to be doing, because nobody should be letting their emotions get the best of them or the better of them in that situation. 

Lessons need to be learned. Actions have consequences. If you are not ready for the consequence to your action, maybe you should not be doing the action. Maybe you should start thinking about it before you do the action, because that is the time you can correct it. 

That is the time you can prevent legal consequences, prevent losing a job, prevent whatever the outcome may be.

Because when you look back, when you are fired, when you are let go, when your contract is terminated, and you look back to the point where you had the choice of either stopping, not starting in the first place, or letting it be, you will see that you chose to continue. 

So you put yourself in the situation you are currently in at that moment, with possibly no job. You cannot blame anyone else but yourself.

When the person you are targeting is taking themselves out of a contracted job, in something they know how to do very well, and they are an upcoming rising person in this industry, and you forced them into a situation where they back out of their contract just to not be around you, that says more than you need to know. 

That tells you everything. That person is willing to lose that job, willing to lose that title, willing to back out of that industry just so they do not have to be anywhere near you. That is embarrassing, and you should be fully embarrassed for that to be the case.

  You are causing him to back out of a contract,  a job that he loves doing,  just because you are selfish, you do not understand the word no, and you refuse to learn. 

And that is what you need to start thinking about right this second, right now, at this moment, before it is too late, because you cannot undo your action and you cannot erase that consequence that will be yours to carry and impact YOUR future.

1qz0e6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1qz0e6i/just_got_back_from_my_first_solo_trip_through/,Just got back from my first solo trip through Portugal: Here's what I learned about making friends on the road (even if you're shy) 🌍,"Okay, I just got back from two weeks crisscrossing Portugal solo, and here's the honest truth: I'm an introvert. Seriously. The thought of striking up conversations with strangers usually makes my palms sweat. So, when I booked my first solo trip, my biggest fear wasn't getting lost or navigating the language barrier; it was eating every single meal alone and feeling utterly isolated.

But Portugal surprised me. I didn't come back with a new squad of lifelong best friends, but I did consistently connect with people – for a meal, an afternoon, or a memorable evening – often in ways I never expected. It wasn't always effortless, especially for someone who defaults to quiet observation, but it was absolutely doable.

Here's what I learned about making friends on the road, even if you’re as shy as I am:

*   **Hostels are still your best bet, but choose wisely.** I stayed in a mix, but the ones that worked best weren't the massive party hostels. Look for places with:
    *   **A common area that feels like a living room, not a cafeteria.** Think comfy couches, board games, or a small bar. My hostel in Lisbon's Alfama district had a small, inviting rooftop terrace where people naturally chatted over coffee or a beer.
    *   **Organized events, but low-key ones.** Free walking tours, communal dinners (often for €10-15), or even just a pre-arranged pub crawl. These break the ice without forcing awkward small talk. I joined a Port wine tasting at a hostel in Porto and ended up having dinner with a few folks from the group.
*   **Embrace the ""soft ask"" – and accept the ""soft no.""** Instead of a direct ""Want to hang out?"", try something gentler. ""Anyone heading to X today?"" or ""Does anyone know a good spot for Y?"" The worst that happens is someone says no, or nobody responds, which is usually just a blip, not a personal rejection. I often just asked hostel staff for recommendations and sometimes other solo travelers overheard and chimed in, starting a conversation.
*   **Free walking tours are social gold.** Seriously. In Lisbon, I joined one that covered the Baixa and Alfama districts. It’s a ready-made group of people, many of whom are solo travelers. After the tour, it’s super easy to ask, ""Hey, anyone grabbing lunch?"" I ended up sharing some excellent *bacalhau à brás* with two other travelers from the tour. Costs nothing beyond a tip for the guide, and it sets you up for connections.
*   **The bar stool is your friend (literally).** Especially if you're eating alone. Instead of a table tucked away in a corner, opt for a seat at the bar. Bartenders are often local gems, full of advice, and other solo diners often gravitate there too. In a small tavern in Faro, I ended up sharing travel stories with a guy from Australia over petiscos (Portuguese tapas) simply because we were the only two at the bar. A small glass of vinho verde or a beer is usually just €2-3, making it a low-stakes way to linger and be open to conversation.
*   **Don’t underestimate shared experiences.** Cooking classes, surf lessons (even if you're terrible like me), or fado nights. These put you in a situation where you're focused on an activity, taking the pressure off direct conversation. My fado experience in Coimbra, where we all squeezed into a tiny, candlelit venue, created an instant bond among the small group of tourists.
*   **Be genuinely curious.** The easiest way to start a conversation, even when shy, is to ask questions. ""Where are you from?"" ""What brings you to Portugal?"" ""Any recommendations for dinner?"" People generally love talking about themselves and their travels. It takes the pressure off you to entertain.

**Real Talk:** It wasn't all sunshine and group dinners. There were definitely nights I ate alone, scrolled on my phone, and felt a pang of loneliness. There were moments when I saw a lively group and just couldn't bring myself to approach them. And that’s okay. Solo travel isn't about being surrounded by people constantly; it's about being comfortable in your own company, *and* being open to connections when they arise. For a shy person, that balance is crucial. The key is just showing up and being open to the possibility, even if it feels a little scary at first.

I came out about three years ago and dated a few women last year and had lots of first dates. I tried really hard to simultaneously keep my marriage afloat. We had originally opened our marriage for sexual experiences. I realized instantly I love gay sex but wasn’t sure if it was more than that. 

I’ve always had trouble accepting that my husband is not one to give words of affirmation, for lack of a better description, or being very open with his feelings. But, tried to work without that. I think I felt like I was the problem for a long time. And just hoping I could eventually find ways to fill those needs myself. He swears he feels them, when I ask he tells me I’m beautiful and I know he does love me. But, it just isn’t enough and I feel awful about it. We would’ve celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary next week. I’ve already gone so long having a pretty decent marriage and we’ve had other struggles and worked so hard to get past those. We have three great kids that we raised pretty damn well together. It feels so dumb to throw that all away, in a sense. 

I pretty instantly found those needs met by the women I dated. I thought maybe that could be enough and I could continue with my marriage. But, I realized that would not work. I still needed him to give me those things if I want a happy marriage. Receiving them from someone else did not remove that need. 

I had a few situationships but still questioned if a woman could be right for me for the long term. Yes, the sex is amazing and I’m finally receiving things I’ve yearned for so long. But, I questioned if a woman or anyone else, would also be able to give me the day to day compatibility and friendship I receive from my husband. 

I started dating my girlfriend in October and we’ve been having an incredible time together. I only get to see her once a week, but it’s been all I’ve ever wanted. 

Then it started to become harder to want to be intimate with him. We had a pretty good sex life and would normally have sex twice a week or so. It wasn’t perfect, but he knew my body pretty well. I wasn’t sure if it was the connection I’m having with my gf taking me away from wanting to be with him. If I’m actually a lesbian and that’s the cause, if it’s perimenopause causing the lack of desire. I recognize that I’m in the honeymoon phase with my gf, so I don’t want to just say I like sex with her better and end my marriage. It just felt so hard to figure it all out. I also worry being neurodivergent is playing a part in my desire for her right now, I’m scared that I’ll find myself regretting leaving my husband when the dopamine spikes end with her. It also makes it hard for me to track my thoughts easily and make decisions (in everyday life as well). 

I’ve been seeing an amazing therapist for about six months. Along with working these feelings out, we’ve also been working on childhood trauma and coming into myself now and what I really want in my life. My husband and I also started seeing a couples therapist three weeks ago. 

A few things have come up, 1. I’m not even sure that him giving me the things I need from him will make me want to be married to him. I’m not convinced that’s the cure all. 2. While he does see how learning express himself would positively affect me and our kids, he thinks it’s just not in him. IMO, it’s a learned skill. It’s not something he learns as a kid, but he could learn now. He thinks it’s just not who he is. 3. I don’t want to change my partner. If he’s okay with who he is and doesn’t really see the intrinsic benefit from learning to express himself, well I don’t want that. 

Ironically enough we had a pretty positive week. He was sick last week so we had zero physical interaction. This week, he hugged and kissed a little and cuddled in bed Friday. Today, we checked in with one another over coffee. And pretty much had the same discussion we always do and it just became more clear that it’s not working. And I think I admitted to myself I don’t want to be with him. At least right now. I think time apart will be helpful for me to get a better grasp on things and really have the space to make decisions on how I want to spend my time. I have a lot of guilt choosing to see my gf over him and still trying to volunteer and see friends. But, I do want to do those things more if I’m being honest with myself. 

I also, one million percent don’t want this decision to be made because I have a gf. I want it to be purely for my best interest. I don’t want to move in with her or level up our relationship more because of this. But, I also don’t want to end things with her. Is it possible I can grieve and heal from ending my marriage while continuing to see her? Idk, but I will be asking my therapist this week.

1qyzsk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1qyzsk7/seeking_advice_for_dealing_withfrenemy/,Seeking advice for dealing with“frenemy”,"Hi all,

I could use some advice about a “friend” in my friend group. She is the adult best friend of my childhood best friend. I lived abroad for some time in my 20’s and they became very close. She’s good friends with a couple of my other friends, and it’s become a “group” over the past 15 years. 

The problem is that she does not always treat me kindly or with the respect I expect from people I call friends. 

A few examples:
- right after sharing a touching story of how I bought a toy for our shared best friend’s first baby, that baby dropped said toy. She kicked it across the room.
- I invited her to my bachelorette and she clicked “not attending” - no text, no message, no post. 
- she came to my wedding and almost immediately after started hounding me for the photos she asked our photographer to take of her and our other friends and their partners… without my husband and I
- posted one of her own photos from my wedding with the friend group except me (she had the exact same photo with me in it) 
- took a photo of the gift I bought the shared friend’s child and texted it to someone, then pushed it across the coffee table with her foot.
- my husband feels like she’s never been kind to him
- came to a craft night that I hosted where I provided food, snacks, drinks and then invited some of the other girls to hang out in a couple of weeks while standing in front of me

These are just a few examples. The girls’ night was tonight and I’m at the end of my rope. I no longer want to put up with being treated as lesser because she envies the length of the relationship I have with our shared friend. I do feel like it’s “equalizing” behaviour - when she feels less, she acts out by trying to make me feel less. I really don’t feel like I’m doing anything to provoke this behaviour and I feel like I’ve been more than generous and very kind. 

My question is this: how do I navigate cutting her out without becoming the villain? I am worried that these have largely been microaggressions that have not been visible to others. Has anyone had experience cutting out one toxic member of a friend group (who everyone else likes)? Any advice? 

Grateful for any insight, guidance of advice. Thanks in advance!! ",15,1770526269.0,AskWomenOver30,38,0.84,False

I’m 23F, graduated last May, and moved back home to Aurora to save/pay off student loans. I didn’t expect it to be this tough to build genuine friendships in the suburbs — a lot of people already seem settled socially, while I’m kind of starting from scratch again.

I’m in dance classes (Latin dance in Chicago + a group in the suburbs), church groups, etc. — I meet people, but it’s tough to connect when everyone’s at different life stages or far away.

I’m hoping to find people around my age who also want friendships that go beyond “see you next week at the meeting” — whether that’s grabbing coffee, walking around a market, trying a new restaurant, museum hopping, workout classes, or even just hanging out whether that's in the suburbs or in the city.

For anyone who’s been here:

* How did you make friends post-grad?
* Are there good ways to meet people in/near Aurora? Or even closer to the city that I could take the Metra into?
* Or… anyone else in the same boat and want to connect?

I’d buy new gym clothes, sign up for monthly challenges, even pay for memberships I barely used. Every January, I’d be hyped, only to burn out by February, feeling like a total failure. I used to hit snooze seven times, dreading the thought of another intense workout I felt obligated to do, then beat myself up all day for not doing it. The cycle of guilt and frustration was exhausting.

I tried all the usual advice: ""just show up,"" ""make it a habit,"" ""find an accountability partner."" None of it stuck. I’d track my progress, set aggressive goals, and follow workout plans to the letter, but my motivation would always fizzle out. My turning point came after yet another failed attempt, when I sat down, utterly defeated, and realized I was always focusing on the *what* — *what* exercise to do, *what* reps, *what* weight — instead of the *why*. *Why* did I actually want to move my body? The ""aha moment"" was realizing I didn't care about a six-pack as much as I cared about feeling alive and present.

This led me to what I now call **The Purpose-Driven Movement Framework**:

1.  **Uncover Your Deep ""Whys""**: This is more than ""lose weight"" or ""get fit."" Dig deeper.
    *   *Example:* My initial ""why"" was ""to be healthier."" Too vague. I dug deeper: *I want to have the energy to play tag with my niece without getting winded. I want to feel strong enough to carry my own groceries without strain. I want to use movement to clear my head so I can focus on my creative projects.* These are real, tangible feelings and experiences, not just numbers on a scale.
    *   *Action:* Grab a journal. Ask yourself: ""Why do I *really* want to move? What would movement *enable* me to do or feel in my daily life? What kind of person do I want to be that regular movement supports?"" Keep asking ""why"" until you hit something that genuinely resonates emotionally.

2.  **Connect ""Why"" to ""What"" (Flexibly)**: Once you have your deep whys, think about *how* different types of movement serve those whys. This frees you from rigid routines.
    *   *Example:* If my why is ""clear my head for creative work,"" a brisk walk in nature or a peaceful yoga session might be more effective than an intense HIIT class. If my why is ""play with my niece,"" strength training becomes appealing for functional strength.
    *   *Action:* For each ""why,"" list 2-3 types of movement that directly support it. Don't worry about perfection; just brainstorm. This creates a menu of options based on your *current* needs.

3.  **Embrace ""Permission to Suck"" Days**: The biggest myth I believed was that every workout had to be intense and perfect. This kills consistency.
    *   *Realization:* *Showing up, even for 5 minutes, is a win.* It maintains the habit loop.
    *   *Action:* If you're tired or low on time, allow yourself to do the bare minimum. A 10-minute walk, 5 minutes of stretching, or a few easy bodyweight exercises. The goal isn't peak performance; it's presence and reaffirming your commitment to your ""why."" The ""movement for a purpose, not just a measurement"" mantra became my guide.

4.  **Regularly Revisit Your Whys**: Life changes, and so do our motivations. What was powerful a month ago might need a refresh.
    *   *Action:* Once a week (or whenever you feel your motivation dip), reread your whys. Visualize yourself achieving them. Remind yourself *why* you started and *why* you're continuing. I even have mine written on a sticky note by my coffee maker.

This isn't a magic bullet, and it definitely wasn't easy. In the first month, I almost gave up when I skipped two days in a row due to travel and felt the old guilt creeping in. I had to consciously pull out my ""why"" list and remind myself that consistency is about showing up *most* of the time, not *all* of the time. This approach might not work for someone who thrives purely on external competition or quantitative goals; it's deeply internal. It took me a solid few weeks to truly feel the shift, and three months to establish my current habit of daily movement.

The results, however, are undeniable. For the first time in my life, I've consistently moved my body daily for three months straight. My energy levels are through the roof. I sleep better, my mood is more stable, and I tackle demanding work projects with a focus I haven't had in years. I'm not just ""working out""; I'm *moving with intention*, and it has transformed how I feel in my own skin and how I show up in my life. I can chase my niece without huffing and puffing, and that feeling is worth more than any aesthetic goal.

No fancy dates, just gas station taquitos and a lot of uncomfortable talking

I realized we were roommates when I found myself fantasizing about my husband's funeral.

Not bc I wanted him dead. I just wanted to feel something. Any thing.

We'd been married six years. Two kids. A mortgage. And somewhere between the diaper changes and the ""did you pay the electric bill?"" texts, we forgot to be in love.
The silence was the worst part. That heavy, polite silence where you're both scrolling on your phones in bed, backs turned, pretending to be tired. I used to make up reasons to stay in the bathroom longer just to avoid walking past him in the hallway. Not bc we were fighting. Bc we were nothing.

He forgot my birthday. I didn't remind him. That was our dynamic by then whoever cared less, won.

The night it broke me
I was folding his socks (always his socks, why do men have so many identical black socks??) and I started crying. Not pretty crying. Ugly, snotty, ""what happened to us"" crying.

He walked in. Saw me. And said—this is verbatim ""Did you burn dinner again?""
I didn't even have the energy to be mad. I just felt invisible. Like I'd become furniture in my own life. A really efficient appliance that cooked and cleaned and scheduled pediatrician appointments.

That night I googled ""how to fix a dead marriage"" at 2am like a cliche. Found some therapist's blog. Found a Reddit thread from a guy who said his wife implemented ""some 777 thing"" and it sounded stupid but also... structured. I like structure. I'm the person who color-codes the grocery list.
So I proposed it. Not as a ""let's save us"" thing that felt too desperate. I pitched it like an experiment. ""Let's try this dumb internet rule for 3 months and if it sucks we'll laugh about it later.

He shrugged. Said sure. That was our enthusiasm level. Sure.

What we actually did (the messy reality)
The 777 rules in relationship circles sounded too clean. Too Pinterest. So we hacked it.

Every 7 days: Date night. But not fancy. First one was literally gas station taquitos in the car bc our sitter canceled. We talked more in that 20 minutes than we had in months. About stupid stuff his annoying coworker, my mom's group drama. But we looked at each other while talking. That was new.

Every 7 weeks: Overnight somewhere. First try? We fought the whole drive to a cheap motel 45 minutes away. About directions. About who forgot the phone charger. About everything except what mattered.

But then we got there. No kids. No dishes. And at some point, lying on that scratchy motel comforter watching bad cable, he reached for my hand. Didn't say anything. Just held it.

I remembered that I used to love his hands.
Every 7 months: The big trip. We haven't hit our first one yet. But we planned it. Actually sat down with laptops and booked flights while the kids destroyed the living room around us. Felt like conspiring teenagers.

What changed (and what didn't)
Here's the truth no one tells you: the 777 rule for couples isn't about the dates. It's about the anticipation. The knowing that someone prioritized you enough to block calendar time.

I started doing my hair again on Thursdays bc date night was Friday. He started putting his phone in the drawer at 8pm bc he knew I'd actually want to talk. Small. But we were building a habit of choosing each other.

Did it fix everything? No. We still argue about the thermostat. I still sometimes feel lonely. But now I tell him instead of crying into his socks.

The 777 rule manifestation stuff writing down what you want? I tried it. Wrote ""I want to feel seen"" seven times for seven days. Felt silly. But then I started saying what I needed out loud. Coincidence? Maybe. But I got seen.

If you're reading this and feeling that heavy roommate silence
You don't need a perfect marriage. You need a next Thursday. Something on the calendar that isn't a dentist appointment or a parent-teacher conference. Something that's just for the two of you, even if it's taquitos in a parking lot.

I made a tracker. Super basic just boxes to check off, spaces to scribble what you actually did. Bc the thing about saving a relationship is you need proof that you're trying. Otherwise the days blur and you wake up six years later wondering when you became strangers.

If you want it, it's here: [777 Rule Tracker PDF](https://buymeacoffee.com/m.mehul/e/489255)

Not saying it'll work for everyone. But I'm sitting here typing this while my husband who used to forget I existed is making me coffee bc he knows I have a deadline. He remembered. That's the win.
Don't wait until you're fantasizing about funerals to try something. Start messy. Start with sure. Just start.

The foodbank then distributes the food to the community. There are no income limits, they just need to know how many people are in your family so they know how much you can take.

Here's what I/we have done/eaten so far:

* I turned one container of strawberries into a strawberry compote. There were some pretty gnarly berries in there so I wanted to make sure to save the good ones immediately.
* One of the long loaves of artisan bread was stale AF. I tried cutting a couple slices to serve with the slow-cooker beef stew I made and it was okay when soaked in the broth, but I ended up just reverting to the dinner rolls as a side. When I went to put the bread back in its bag, the bottom unexpectedly popped open so I figured that was my sign to use it immediately. I ended up chopping it into small pieces, placing it in a nice baking tray, and covering it in a mixture of coconut milk, eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and honey. It's now sitting in our refrigerator covered with aluminum foil so everything gets saturated (hopefully--there was a lot of bread and only one can of coconut milk). I'll toss it in the oven in the morning for breakfast and plan to top it with the strawberry compote. I'd usually use regular milk but we have a dairy-free friend staying the night tonight.
* Speaking of the friend, we ensured that the desert item we got was dairy free. I served up some strawberry pie before dinner because why not. There's now only a couple pieces left.
* It's hard to see in the picture, but we got a decent sized jug of a Starbucks Peppermint Mocha drink. I helped myself to some of this as a treat for hauling everything inside. And all of us dug into the donuts because why not?
* We also got a bag of coffee which is always appreciated! It's whole bean, and we don't have a grinder anymore, but I'm thinking maybe I can put it in the food processor? I'm going to have to research this. I can also borrow my parent's grinder if I have to.
* I ate the hummus/pretzel snack pack because no one else wanted it.
* The friend dug into the large tub of hummus and the carrot sticks. It's such a large tub I'm not entirely sure how we'll get through it all this week. I guess I could put it on toast for breakfast, maybe with some eggs.
* The watermelon was cut up as a snack as well. Honestly it was not the best watermelon I've ever tasted. More watery than sweet, but the half I cut was eaten up. The other half is sitting in the fridge to be cut up another day.

This week's plans:

* Hamburger Buns: We have so much canned salmon that I've been making salmon burgers every week. Gonna keep doing this so we have a more reasonable amount of salmon on hand.
* Ribs: The ribs they gave were HUGE, I wanted to let them thaw in the refrigerator but it was full so I had to put them in the freezer. We are definitely eating them at some point this week, there's a recipe I tried a few months back that I'm hoping I can find again.
* Deli Meat: There are two packs, one is just covered up. I'm thinking I'll do some kind of sliders with the sourdough bread loaf. I'll need to pick up the cheddar cheese we get through WIC. Somehow we are COMPLETELY CHEESELESS right now for the first time in probably years. I don't know how that happened.

I'm honestly not sure about everything else. I feel like I have a lot and somehow nothing lol. But I'll figure it out.

Madison liked to wake up early and jog down Sinatra drive. The Hudson River smelled of the ocean, and on windy days lapped against the seawall. She liked watching Manhattan eclipse the sunrise. She liked the loop she ran which took her into Port Imperial and through the Lackawanna Terminal into Jersey City, and how the route ending coincided with the sun rising above the city. The last segment of her run was in the sunlight, and with this routine she felt fortified and prepared for the day.

Today she started her run an hour earlier than usual. When she woke up at 6AM, she noticed her husband wasn't there beside her. She didn’t worry about it much, and she smelled something bad, strong enough that it made it easy to get up to leave. She rinsed off in the bathroom, changed into her running clothes, made the bed, grabbed a bottle from the fridge, heard a bestial grunt behind the door, closed it, saw a camel, jumped. In the moment it felt very real, this camel in the kitchen. Any sense of panic was quickly subsumed by a sense of elevation which would have allowed her to confront an intruder if only there was an a human intruder to confront and that the situation was comprehensible, but since there was no clarity she ran out of the apartment. 

 She assumed that the camel wasn’t real, but it seemed real. She then left her building and walked down Willow Ave. The further she got from her apartment, the more it started feeling like a dream. 

Panic from a dream has a way of quickly dissipating, and by the time she was at the coffee shop on the corner of fifth, the memory was almost entirely reframed. She was lucid now and she wondered where her husband actually went. There were no texts, she tried to call him and his phone went to voicemail. He worked in finance, and he had proven himself to be one of those people who were permitted a life, as long as he would drop everything to resolve a work emergency if needed. Him disappearing in the middle of the night didn’t strike her as strange, but him not answering made her uneasy. She would try again in a half an hour. 

She walked into the coffee shop, ordered a chai latte, then recognized a friend she made in traffic court last week. 

“Hi” “Hi” they both said in this elongated way, almost harmonizing, 

“It’s so good to see you!” 

“and you too!” 

“I was so surprised to see you here. I was like is that Natalie?” 

“I come here every day!” 

They both kind of spoke over each other.

“How have I never run into you. How are things?” 

“I got a follow-up interview, it’s looking like I might get the job I was telling you about.”

 “Thats great!""

 “I’m excited it’s going to be such a big change.” 

“How about you?"" 

It’s a strange thing. They met for the first time last week at traffic court, and they maybe only talked to each other for about an hour. But they did both remind each other of people whom they were already acquainted with, and when they talked to each other they might not have been talking to each other, but instead to the friends whom they mutually reminded each other of, but Madison considered it important to seemingly treat everyone as a friend. Real friendship to Madison was who she chose to spend her limited time with, she was liked by everyone, and she had these sorts of conversations too many times, but the “how about you” threw her off balance. She had to think about how she usually answered that question, and this remembering made for a subtle but noticeable pause. The sky brightened like a shifting gear, but it was still dark out and something did still feel off.

“I’m good. I’ve been working a lot this past week, so I’ve been exhausted”

Madison noticed that she broke the tempo of the conversation with this response. She was complaining to a stranger, which she had no intention of doing. She was even more uncomfortable now, but the barista broke the moment by calling out her name for her drink. She grabbed her drink, said goodbye to Natalie, arranged half-baked plans, and then Madison left.

She was glad to be out and on her way. She couldn’t forgive herself for her small blunder, and the sky being dark from the late fall sunrise made this event feel like another dream, another dream which she could easily forget. Coffee shops belong in morning light, but it was still dark, and with the observation the blunder stopped feeling real.

She continued down fifth street towards Sinatra Drive. Some rats were still out and as she approached they scurried away into their holes beneath the buildings. When she arrived at the river the more complete sky revealed that it wasn’t as dark as she had assumed, and that the day, and all of the implications of the day were rushing in. The river felt more like an ocean, and in the early morning light, the small waves had a drama to them, each ripple had a bit was completely shaded on one side, and completely illuminated on the other, and in the contrast the water seemed to have a blue glow, almost as if the sun wasn’t coming out from far behind the horizon but instead out of the ocean itself. This was her favorite time of day, and there was a melancholy to it which she noticed, and there was a light joy to the melancholy which she also noticed. In some moments of her life, she could feel rapture before nature, but today the water was just the river, and the city was something she saw before. She found that it looked particularly nice today, and she noticed that fact had not created in her a sense of joy. 

She thought again about the camel. It felt like a dream when she didn’t think about it, but when she thought about it, she remembered that in the moment it felt real. The realest dream she ever had. She also found it strange that there was no disruption in continuity, she had no memory of waking up following this dream, all she remembered was walking outside into this very same morning. 

“This must be it for me” she considered, half jokingly. 

She remembered her slip-up at the coffee shop earlier, and then laughed at the thought of her describing the dream to this near-stranger. “What if Natalie said ‘we should go and check.’ How awkward I would seem when she noticed that as we approached, I was becoming genuinely anxious!” She checked her phone to see if her husband texted back yet. He didn’t. Then, she had ridiculous thought. This thought worried her, her having that sort of thought worried her, and her being worried about that sort of thought worried her. She was finished with her latte. She put on music, and started her run. She accepted that the camel wasn’t a dream, but instead a new phenomenon which she had never before experienced, a hallucination, from either lingering dream chemicals, or from a future problem. Neither option was of much use, and she realized she needs to stop thinking about it.

She ran, but she felt drowsy.

While jogging her phone rang. She received a call from the landlord. There was a noise complaint. The police were called. She had a camel in her apartment. Her husband’s phone was on the ground near the camel, along with his clothes. She realized and quickly accepted that it was her husband who turned into the camel. People don’t have the emotions which can respond to this sort of thing, and because of that she felt very little. She accepted this as an answer to her concerns. Her husband was gone now. She didn’t really feel much of anything about it. She felt stronger emotions from the earlier fear that she might be losing her sanity. Maybe she did lose her sanity, but now that would almost be a relief. It would be better than having to answer for this emptiness about the whole thing which she felt. A month ago, her husband almost died in a car accident. She was worried to tears. she rushed to Englewood to see him, and nearly crashed on the way. Did she lose her care for him in the past month? He is gone now. There is a camel in his place. Is he the camel, or is the camel a gravestone, she wondered.

She stopped her run, and walked aimlessly. She messaged a friend, asking if she could stay at her apartment, as there was an emergency. Her friend Daniella was away, but left a key under the mat. Madison went there, opened the medicine cabinet, took a few Tylenol PMs, drank 2 or 3 shots of vodka, and hoped to fall asleep.

She woke up in the afternoon unsure if she slept at all. She was under a sunbeam, and she briefly forgot the strangeness of the early morning. She looked at the living room of her friend, and it was nice enough. It didn’t have the feeling of completeness, the feeling that every item was where it was created to be - that she felt she had. Something was missing here. She heard footsteps, and she couldn’t remember anyone entering - which told her she must have fallen asleep. She rolled over and the crouch creaked, alerting Daniella.

“You’re finally awake. I’m so sorry. What happened?” Daniella asked.

Madison was unsure of what she meant, but then she remembered - and she didn’t feel that she was remembering something real. 

“How did you even get a camel into your place? Without anyone noticing?” Daniella asked.

Madison was thinking and didn’t respond.

 “I Called your job and told them you had an emergency. Don’t worry about work today. I also called Emily, she’s driving over” Daniella said. 

“From Connecticut?” Madison said.

“I talked to her a few hours ago. She’s almost here.”

Not long after, Emily, Madison’s sister, arrived. The sisters caught up, and Emily sensed not to mention the camel.

“Let’s go to the West Village,” Emily said.

“I want to get drunk on a pier,”  Madison said.

“Let’s do that. Only it’s fall, I don’t know if any pier spots are open.”

Emily and Madison drove together. 

Madison fell asleep in the car, and woke up in a Manhattan parking garage. They left and found a bar near the Hudson, with a window view of New Jersey. It was almost 5 now, and the sun was beginning to set. Madison wanted an Aperol. Emily ordered one with her. 

“This is a nice place,” Madison said. 

“It is.” 

Emily was curious where Madison’s husband was. She wondered if Madison knew more than she said, but she knew not to ask. It was a nice evening, and Madison instinctively reached for her phone to invite her husband. She wasn’t sure how she felt when she remembered, but she was disappointed to not spend the afternoon with him. From where she sat, through the window, she had a view of Hoboken. There are no skyscrapers in Hoboken. It looks unremarkable from the New York side, next to Jersey City which feels like a real city. Still, the sun set, and Hoboken isn’t tall enough to eclipse the sun. You see the sun fall through into land behind it. Hoboken doesn't cast a shadow, and she was glad to not be there.",1,1770525757.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False

I was thinking a good idea (since I have both platforms) is to maybe get the deluxe version on xbox and then when the gold edition comes out in like a year with dlc I'll get it physical for ps5. My only question is I know Xbox can sometimes be notorious with their physical games where there's no data on the disc except for install data with an internet connection required, Obviously I'm aware games get updated past their release and the physical disc will be outdated with patches but I'd like to know the disc won't be a coffee coaster on day one either.",1,1770525722.0,residentevil,1,1.0,False

1qyzlst,https://www.reddit.com/r/auroraillinois/comments/1qyzlst/anyone_else_postgrad_and_back_home_trying_to/,Anyone else post-grad and back home trying to rebuild a social life?,"Hi! I’m 23F, graduated last May, and moved back home to Aurora to save/pay off student loans. I didn’t expect it to be this tough to build genuine friendships in the suburbs — a lot of people already seem settled socially, while I’m kind of starting from scratch again.

I’m in dance classes (Latin dance in Chicago + a group in the suburbs), church groups, etc. — I meet people, but it’s tough to connect when everyone’s at different life stages or far away.

I’m hoping to find people around my age who also want friendships that go beyond “see you next week at the meeting” — whether that’s grabbing coffee, walking around a market, trying a new restaurant, museum hopping, workout classes, or even just hanging out whether that's in the suburbs or the city. 

For anyone who’s been here:

* How did you make friends post-grad?
* Are there good ways to meet people in/near Aurora? Or even closer to the city that I could take the Metra into?
* Or… anyone else in the same boat and want to connect?
