My boyfriend, let‚Äôs call him L is 29. We‚Äôve been together for 3 years. This pregnancy has been very hard. I have Hyperemesis Gravidarum which is extreme morning sickness, low blood pressure and I see black spots randomly and nearly pass out sometimes, it has not been easy. 
  
 I dated my ex, C, in high school and a little bit of college but he moved away for a while and we broke up on good terms. He is a sweet guy. When I met L I found out that him and C were friends. So eventually we all started hanging out together and it was never an issue that he‚Äôs my ex. 

The town we live in is small and you can walk everywhere. My friend works at a coffee shop in town and she makes me drinks for free so when L is at work and I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôll take a walk across town and get a free drink and hangout with her for a little bit. This time C was also there, he bought me food and we talked for awhile and then got the drinks to go. 

  He said I should swing by his apartment because he has a gift for the baby and he has to walk his dog, Luke. So we get to the apartment and the present was a onesie with L‚Äôs favorite sports team on it. I went outside with him to walk Luke, it must‚Äôve been the heat and all the walking because  we didn‚Äôt even make it down the sidewalk before I started throwing up. It splashed up on my legs, got in my hair and a little on my shirt. 


 My options were to shower there, walk home with throw up on me, or get in his car and have him take me home with throw up on me. He let me back into the apartment. Threw a towel and tshirt into the bathroom and went back outside to finish Luke‚Äôs walk. Once I got dressed and cleaned up  he drove me home. I went to sleep as soon as I got home. 

  When L came home I told him about my day, leaving no details out and he was surprisingly furious. He said it was disrespectful to shower at another man‚Äôs house especially an ex. I told him I had throw up on me and he said our house isn‚Äôt that far from his apartment and that I should‚Äôve just waited to get home to shower. I told him it‚Äôs 85 degrees out and I wasn‚Äôt walking home with throw up on my legs or getting puke in someone else‚Äôs car. He said the baby present was probably just a way to get me alone with him. I said C has never been that way and has never done anything that feels like he would be hitting on me or trying anything. L said I just don‚Äôt know how guys really think and he can see through the act.",1,1757973476.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I wear ankle length dresses so nobody can see.

I also wear a cardigan to hide the fact I have scars from a past su*cide attempt

My nipples are also ugly, maybe not at the top of my list of insecurity‚Äôs but that mixed with the rest I just know if I ever had sex with a man he‚Äôd see me naked and we wouldn‚Äôt even get to the sex, he‚Äôd run lol.

Now back to the s*icide attempt‚Ä¶. I thought it was going to work so I maxed out a few credit cards prior that I‚Äôm still paying off, my car is on its last legs and‚Ä¶ I live in it ü´† hence why I work in coffee shops/library. I‚Äôm making progress slowly 

It‚Äôs so interesting how these guys that ask me out seem disappointed but they literally have no clue how much they just got saved from a disaster of a person entering their life lol.

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every program, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

The only thing that helped was that damn quiz some guy on reddit recommended to me (this one -¬†[StopSocial](https://stopsocial.today/)). I journal through it currently and my screen time reduced from around 4-5 hours per day to 1 hour so I'd recommend it to those struggling like I did.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

I made a post about it a while back and mentioned how I couldn‚Äôt break the limerence even though I should it should have been. For context this is my first love and first actual serious relationship. We fell out hard and fully lost contact but I fell back into limerence with her after a long time and a second much worse relationship. I fantasized for a long time about getting back together with her. Then I fell into despair knowing I probably never actually would. It faded for a while and I decided to live on my own terms. Fast forward to now and I have a job in Europe and I‚Äôm moving at the end of this week. I‚Äôm nervous but happy and excited and know that this will open a whole new world of opportunities for me. 

But I still do think of her. 

Is it love? I don‚Äôt know. In a sense maybe but we were kids back then. I think it‚Äôs just a deep memory and a care for someone that I won‚Äôt ever fully be rid of, even if we‚Äôre totally different people now and probably not even each others‚Äô ideal partners. But our last conversation sucked hard. I‚Äôve known for a while that if that‚Äôs the last time we speak then I‚Äôll die with regrets. So even if it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúwish you well, maybe in the next life‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hope we can be friends‚Äù or ‚Äúnever contact me again‚Äù or even something else..? I just want to know. I just want to kill that part of me or have something come of it. 

I was in the city she lived in for a long weekend visiting my sister. I considered reaching out then to see if she might want to grab a coffee or something but I chickened out. Dumb of me? Idk. Probably not but I‚Äôm kicking myself kinda. 

I‚Äôm packing and getting rid of stuff right now, not even thinking that I‚Äôll try, and lo and behold, I found the shoebox filled with our relationship keepsakes. Handwritten notes and wax sealed letters, photo booth stickers, little trinkets, the ring I gave her and the key she gave me. Also that‚Äôs something that kills me, I really want her to have that key back. It was from a historic building that burned down and it‚Äôs such a cool relic but it just reminds me of her. I‚Äôd rather she have it back even after all this time. But reading those letters and remembering how was talked to each other, the promises we made back then, the fantasies of the future, made it all flood back, if even for just a moment. So I texted her. 

It wasn‚Äôt long. Three short paragraphs. I said that something reminded me of her and even though it had been a while and we kinda out of the blue, I wanted to check in and see how she‚Äôd been. I told her I was moving out of the country and had been thinking a lot. I apologized for my wrongdoings and the person I used to be, which embarrasses me still. I told her I‚Äôd love to catch up if she wanted to talk at all, but had no expectations. I told her that if we didn‚Äôt talk, I wished her well, and I left it at that. 

When I sent it I had a long moment of ‚Äúholy shit I can‚Äôt believe I just did that‚Äù. The thing I had typed out, deleted, thought of doing and chickened out for several years, and I did it before I could think twice. No going back. 

She read it the next minute. That was an hour and a half ago. Thus far, radio silence and I can‚Äôt unglue myself from my phone. 

I‚Äôm glad I did it because the other option was die wondering. But my god I can‚Äôt help but think that if she just never responds it won‚Äôt be worse than any other option. Part of me wondered if my number would be blocked and that would be the end of it. And I did consider this happening. Ok, fine. It‚Äôs an answer in and of itself, and I made my intentions and state of mind known to her. That‚Äôs all well and good. Plus, if she is responding, then I wouldn‚Äôt expect it instantly. If she had been the one to reach out then I might‚Äôve needed a full day to gather my senses and respond. But‚Ä¶oh *god* I really did it huh? 

I guess my OCD and impulsiveness got the better of me. I hope she responds. I hope some good can come of this, even if it‚Äôs just another step in breaking the limerence for good. I won‚Äôt have time to see her see her, she lives like five hours away now and like I said I‚Äôm preparing to move abroad next week. But still, maybe calling would be nice. Maybe. Idk. 

Funny enough I got prescribed Wellbutrin and Lexapro today to deal with my rumination/OCD/anxiety and depression. Haven‚Äôt started yet but maybe this is my brain‚Äôs one last manic ‚Äúhurrah‚Äù before we smother that infant. ",6,1757972235.0,limerence,6,1.0,False

I scheduled one and the receptionist said ""oh he definitely covered the mouth and chin, also there might be an extra cost"" if I wanted a touch up.

The heat in Michael Carter‚Äôs own kitchen was a solid thing, a weight on the shoulders. It was the kind of dry, relentless Australian heat that baked the red earth outside until it cracked, and it seemed to have seeped into the very foundations of his life, leaching the colour from everything. He stood at the sink, a tall, stooped man in his late forties, rinsing a single coffee mug. His own.

From the living room, the sound of the television, some reality show judging people, blared. Karen‚Äôs laughter, sharp and bright as shattered glass, cut over it. He could picture her: curled on the sofa, phone in hand, a glass of chilled white wine sweating on the coaster he‚Äôd bought her from a gift shop in Broome. She‚Äôd hated it. ‚ÄòTacky,‚Äô she‚Äôd said.

‚ÄúAnother early one, Mike?‚Äù she called out, not bothering to turn down the volume. It wasn‚Äôt a question of concern. It was a statement of fact, an inventory of his predictability.

‚ÄúStocktake at the depot,‚Äù he said to the window over the sink, watching his own faint reflection in the dark glass. The yard was a vast, dark emptiness, the boundary fence swallowed by the night. ‚ÄúMight be late.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm.‚Äù Her hum was a dismissal. He heard the clack of her nails on her phone screen. Probably messaging Janine or Sarah, planning another ‚Äògirls‚Äô night‚Äô. He knew what those were. The scent of a stranger‚Äôs cologne had clung to her blouse last week, something musky and expensive, nothing like the sawdust and sweat that was his own perfume. He‚Äôd said nothing. Loyalty, to Michael, wasn‚Äôt a contract to be enforced; it was a state of being. A vow was a vow, even if only one person remembered its words.

Their son, Eli, 22, slouched into the kitchen, beelining for the fridge. He was all lanky limbs and entitled slouch, a product of his mother‚Äôs indulgence. ‚ÄúHey, Dad. You‚Äôre still here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeaving now.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Can you spot me a fifty? Big night at the pub tomorrow.‚Äù

Michael dried his hands slowly. ‚ÄúI transferred your allowance on Monday, Eli.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, things come up.‚Äù Eli shrugged, grabbing a sports drink. ‚ÄúForget it. I‚Äôll ask Mum.‚Äù

*She spends it faster than I can make it,*¬†Michael thought, but the words stayed trapped behind his teeth. He was the provider. It was his role, his identity. The man who fixed the leaking tap, who paid the mortgage on this too-big house in the Perth suburbs that Karen had insisted they needed, who made sure his daughter Chloe‚Äôs university fees were paid upfront so she wouldn‚Äôt have a debt hanging over her. He was the silent, reliable engine of their lives, and like any engine, he was only noticed when he sputtered.

Chloe, 19, flitted through on her way out, a blur of designer jeans and disinterest. ‚ÄúBye,‚Äù she tossed in the general direction of the living room, not even glancing his way.

‚ÄúDrive safe, love,‚Äù he said to her retreating back.

The screen door slammed shut. The sound was a full stop on the evening.

He was a ghost in his own home, already fading. A nice guy. A reliable man. A man whose greatest virtue, his loyalty, had become his greatest weakness, rendering him invisible.

An hour later, the emptiness of the house was a physical pressure in his chest. He kissed Karen‚Äôs cheek; she offered it without looking away from the screen, her skin cool against his lips. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait up,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning on it,‚Äù she replied, sweetly.

The night drive was a relief. The vast, dark landscape welcomed his silence. His headlights cut a lonely tunnel through the scrub, the air smelling of dust and eucalyptus. He was heading north, a three-hour haul to the mining depot where he managed logistics. It was a job of endless details, of making sure things arrived where they were supposed to, unseen and on time. He was good at it.

He was pondering a missed invoice, the argument he hadn‚Äôt had with Eli, the vacant look in Chloe‚Äôs eyes, when the roo burst from the scrub. It was a big red, a tonne of muscle and panic, materialising in his high beams. He wrenched the wheel. The ute slewed on the gravel shoulder, tires scrabbling for purchase that wasn‚Äôt there.

The world upended in a roar of tearing metal and shattering glass. The ute rolled, once, twice, the vast, indifferent sky spinning past the windshield, before crashing down an embankment and coming to a rest on its roof, half-submerged in the swollen, rain-fed creek below.

Silence. Then, the greedy gurgle of water.

The policewoman‚Äôs voice was gentle, professionally sombre. ‚ÄúMrs. Carter? I‚Äôm Senior Constable Miller. May we come in?‚Äù

Karen, wrapped in a silk dressing gown, had put on a performance worthy of an award. The trembling hand at her mouth, the wide, disbelieving eyes. ‚ÄúMichael? What‚Äôs happened? Is he alright?‚Äù

Inside, the house felt different. The news had electrified the air. Eli and Chloe stood behind her, pale and shocked into a rare silence.

The police found his vehicle. The driver‚Äôs door was torn off. His wallet was there, sodden, beside his seat. His wedding watch, a cheap, functional thing Karen had mocked for years, was found snapped on the floor, its hands frozen at the time of impact. The creek, swollen from a storm weeks ago, was a brown, rushing torrent. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely the‚Ä¶ the force of the water‚Ä¶‚Äù the constable said, unable to finish the sentence. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre treating it as a recovery operation now. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.‚Äù

The funeral was a masterclass in hypocrisy. Karen, in devastating black, played the grieving widow to a captivated audience of friends and family. She spoke of a ‚Äúdevoted husband‚Äù and a ‚Äúloving father,‚Äù her voice breaking on cue. She leaned on the arms of handsome, sympathetic men Michael barely knew.

Later, back at the house, surrounded by the detritus of sandwiches and half-empty cups, the mask slipped.

‚ÄúThe life insurance,‚Äù she said to Eli, not even bothering to lower her voice as she stacked plates. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a full payout. Double indemnity for accidental death. Over a million.‚Äù There was a gleam in her eye that had been absent for years. ‚ÄúWe can finally take that trip to Europe. And Eli, you can get that new car you wanted. The convertible.‚Äù

Eli‚Äôs grief seemed to evaporate. ‚ÄúSeriously? No way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWay,‚Äù Karen said, a small, victorious smile playing on her lips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what he would have wanted.‚Äù She said it with such conviction, as if Michael‚Äôs entire existence had been a build-up to this final, fruitful payout.

Chloe, picking at a slice of cake, looked less certain, but the relief was there, too. The relief of no more awkward silences, no more disappointed looks from a father she couldn‚Äôt be bothered to understand. His death was a solved problem, a unlocked door.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Eli mused later that night, a beer in his hand already, the mourning period evidently over. ‚ÄúHe was worth more to us dead than he ever was alive.‚Äù

Karen didn‚Äôt chastise him. She just nodded, staring out at the vast, star-dusted sky, already planning her new life. The provider had provided, one last time. His absence was his greatest gift.

And three weeks later, sun-blistered, gaunt, and missing two fingers from his left hand, Michael Carter dragged himself out of the dry riverbed and began the long, painful walk home.

The walk back to the world was a pilgrimage through hell. For three weeks, Michael Carter had been a creature of dust and pain, his world shrunk to the searing heat of the sun by day and the bone-deep cold of the desert by night. A pair of hikers, off the beaten track, had found him delirious and half-dead in a dry river gully, miles from the crash site. He‚Äôd been swept away, yes, but not drowned. Just broken, and lost.

In the regional hospital, they‚Äôd put him in an induced coma to let his body, and his shattered mind, begin the impossible work of repair. He was a John Doe. No ID, no frantic family calling every hospital in the state. Just a quiet, broken man in a quiet, white room.

When he finally surfaced, the world was blurry. A social worker with kind eyes explained the date. Three weeks. Three weeks gone.

His first call home, his voice a rusty croak, was answered by Chloe.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúChloe? Love? It‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs Dad.‚Äù

A long silence, then a sharp, disbelieving laugh. ‚ÄúWhat? Is this some kind of sick joke?‚Äù The line went dead.

The police car that brought him home to the neat suburban house felt like a hearse in reverse. The constable was jovial, slapping him on the back. ‚ÄúWait till they get a load of you, mate! It‚Äôs a miracle!‚Äù

The mirage of a miracle shattered the second Karen opened the door. Her face, caught in the harsh afternoon light, didn‚Äôt register joy. It cycled through shock, then a kind of horrified calculation, and finally settled into a waxen mask of confusion. Behind her, Eli froze, a video game controller dangling from his hand. Chloe peered over the banister, her expression one of pure dread.

‚ÄúMichael?‚Äù Karen‚Äôs voice was a whisper. ‚ÄúMy God.‚Äù

The constable beamed. ‚ÄúSee? Told you! A real resurrection!‚Äù

The public performance began immediately. Neighbours gathered, drawn by the commotion. Karen embraced him, her body stiff and unyielding in his arms, her sobs loud and theatrical for the audience. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a miracle!‚Äù she cried, echoing the constable, her voice ringing with a false note only he could hear. ‚ÄúMy Michael is home!‚Äù

But when the door closed, and the last of the well-wishers had left, the warmth vanished, sucked out of the room like air from an airlock. The house was different. A new, expensive-looking vase stood on the mantelpiece. There was a bottle of top-shelf whiskey on the counter that he would never buy.

Karen turned on him, the mask gone, her eyes hard and bright. ‚ÄúDo you have any idea what you‚Äôve done to us?‚Äù

Michael stood in the middle of the living room, still wearing the hospital‚Äôs donated clothes, too big for his shrunken frame. He felt like a visitor. A ghost.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve done?‚Äù he echoed, his voice faint.

‚ÄúWe mourned you!‚Äù she hissed, her voice low and venomous. ‚ÄúWe buried you! We moved on! We had‚Ä¶ plans. And you just‚Ä¶ stroll back in? You were supposed to be gone.‚Äù The last word was uttered with a chilling finality. It wasn‚Äôt an expression of grief. It was a statement of fact. His return was an administrative error.

The days that followed were a masterclass in silent rejection. He was the awkward piece of furniture that didn‚Äôt fit the new d√©cor.

He saw the new life they‚Äôd built in the shadow of his death. Karen was constantly on her phone, her conversations hushed, her laughter too easy. A sleek, black convertible, Eli‚Äôs ‚Äúgrievance car‚Äù was now parked in the driveway. One evening, a Mercedes SUV he didn‚Äôt recognise pulled up. A tall, silver-haired man in a polo shirt that screamed money got out. Karen met him at the door, her smile radiant. She didn‚Äôt introduce Michael. She ushered the man inside with a proprietary hand on his arm, throwing a glance back at Michael that said,¬†*See what I could have had?*

He tried to talk to Eli, to bridge the chasm that had always been there but was now a gaping void. ‚ÄúSon, maybe we could‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Eli cut him off, not looking up from his phone. ‚ÄúSave it, Dad.‚Äù He finally glanced over, his gaze cool, assessing. ‚ÄúIt was simpler when you were gone. Mum was happy. We had money. You were‚Ä¶ dead weight. Now you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ weight.‚Äù

The word landed like a physical blow.¬†*Dead weight.*

Chloe was the worst, because her rejection was tinged with a pity that was far crueller than outright scorn. He found a university textbook she‚Äôd left on the sofa and tried to engage her, asking a clumsy question about her course. She took the book from him as if his touch had contaminated it, a faint blush of embarrassment on her cheeks. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt, Dad,‚Äù she said softly, avoiding his eyes. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt try to be something you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs cringe.‚Äù

Even the world outside his home reflected his new irrelevance. At the supermarket, Mrs. Henderson from next door gushed to Karen about her ‚Äúunimaginable strength,‚Äù how awful it must be to have her grieving process ‚Äúso brutally interrupted.‚Äù She offered Karen a sympathetic smile and gave Michael a look of vague, uncomfortable pity, as if he were a persistent cold sore.

He was the ghost at the feast, the inconvenient truth haunting their carefully constructed narrative. He saw the looks they exchanged when he entered a room,a swift, silent telegraph of annoyance. He heard the hushed conversations that stopped when he approached.

The revelation didn‚Äôt come in a single, dramatic moment. It seeped into him slowly, like the cold of the desert night, until it was a part of his bones.

He was sitting at the kitchen table one evening, tracing the grain of the wood with a bandaged finger,the two missing ones a dull, phantom ache. Karen was across from him, scrolling through real estate listings on her tablet. ‚ÄúLook at this one, Michael,‚Äù she said, not with excitement, but with a weary resentment. ‚ÄúWaterfront. Would have been ours.‚Äù

The last piece clicked into place.

He saw it all with a horrifying, crystalline clarity. In death, he had been perfect. He was a tragic story, a generous paycheque, a martyr to be pitied and praised. He was the loyal provider, fulfilling his ultimate duty. His absence had given them everything: money, freedom, sympathy, a new beginning.

But alive? Alive, he was a reminder of a loyalty they could never reciprocate. He was a drain on resources, a block to their plans, a boring, unassuming man who demanded nothing but whose very existence was now a condemnation of their character. He was an inconvenience.

The man who had built this life with his own hands, who had worried over mortgages and school fees and grocery bills, was worth less than the memory of that same man. His heart was still beating, but in the economy of his own family, he had been devalued to nothing.

He had come back from the dead, only to discover that his resurrection was a curse. For them, and for himself. The greatest tragedy wasn‚Äôt the accident. It was the walk back home.

The silence in the house was no longer empty; it was accusatory. It was the sound of a life not being lived. Michael sat at the kitchen table, the same one where he‚Äôd eaten a thousand meals they‚Äôd barely shared, and listened to the sounds of his family moving around him, careful not to touch him, as if his disappointment were contagious.

From the living room, Karen‚Äôs laughter rang out, sharp and clear, aimed down the phone line at the silver-haired man in the Mercedes. Eli‚Äôs video game explosions echoed from upstairs, the sound of a life on pause, funded by a death that hadn‚Äôt stuck. Chloe‚Äôs door was shut, music faintly pulsing behind it, a barrier against his very existence.

He looked at his hands on the table. The left one, missing the ring and pinkie fingers, was a mangled testament to his survival. The right, calloused and familiar, was a testament to a lifetime of work. For what?

The question wasn‚Äôt a whisper anymore; it was a roar in his skull.

He had clawed his way back from the edge of oblivion through sheer, dumb instinct, driven by a single, burning thought:¬†*Get home to your family.*¬†He had endured the pain, the disorientation, the crushing loneliness of being a John Doe, all for this. For a wife who saw him as a cancelled cheque that had somehow reappeared. For children who viewed him as a boring ghost haunting their new, upgraded lives.

His loyalty, the core of his identity, had been a monologue delivered to an empty theatre. The real prison wasn‚Äôt this house, or their contempt. It was his own desperate need to be seen by people who had long since closed their eyes.

The ‚Äònice guy‚Äô shell, hardened over forty-eight years, finally cracked. Not with a bang, but with a terrible, silent clarity. The futility of it all washed over him, not as a wave of sadness, but as a wave of release. He was free. Not because they had freed him, but because he had finally seen the lock for what it was: a thing he had built himself, and could therefore walk away from.

He stood up. The chair didn‚Äôt scrape. He moved through the house, a ghost finally accepting its own spectral nature.

In their bedroom, Karen was laying out a new, black dress for another evening out. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait up,‚Äù she said, not turning around, her voice automatic, a recording played for a discarded appliance.

He didn‚Äôt answer. He went to the small home safe, hidden behind a bland landscape painting. He knew the combination. It was Eli‚Äôs birthday. He took the thick envelope of cash inside, the emergency fund Karen had always mocked him for maintaining. He took his passport. He left the insurance paperwork, the bank books, the title to the ute that was now scrap metal.

He walked down the hall and paused outside Chloe‚Äôs door. He could picture her inside, bathed in the light of her laptop, a world away. He thought of saying something, of leaving some profound final word. But any word from him would be, as she said, ‚Äòcringe‚Äô. His greatest gift to her now would be his silence.

He descended the stairs for the last time. Eli was in the kitchen, gulping directly from the orange juice carton.

‚ÄúSee ya, Dad,‚Äù Eli mumbled, a reflexive dismissal, already turning away.

Michael stopped at the door. He looked back at his son, at the living room, at the life he had built. He didn‚Äôt feel anger anymore. He felt a vast, immense distance, as if he were already miles away.

‚ÄúGoodbye, Eli,‚Äù he said. His voice was calm. Final.",1,1757971599.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

25M 6'1 121 lb  
Hashimoto's Disease, roughly 7 years( I take Synthroid 75mcg )  
Bile Gastritis, diagnosed 4 months ago( I take Sucralfate )

I don't drink or smoke.  
I only started drinking caffeine a few months after the symptoms started. I have a cup of coffee in the morning, black. I only drink water after that, usually 1-2 liters.  
My appetite has been reduced significantly, so I don't eat much. Breakfast is usually a banana, a bagel, and black coffee. Dinner is usually chicken breast, a carb like rice/quinoa/beans, and some mixed fresh veggies. I'd say around 1000 calories a day.  
No exercise.

# Symptoms

I think it started around last September(2024)  
[Pain Image](https://ibb.co/Rp3R7LX2)  
Constant pain in upper right abdomen(Light Blue circle in linked image). I'd say probably around a 7/10 pain and it's throughout the entire day. It gets worse when I lay down, especially so if I lay on my right side.

Occasional sharp pain that runs down the right side(Orange circle in link). Happens a few times a day. Feels like it happens in a small line running down.

Slight pain and discomfort in lower abdomen(Around the Green circle in link). This isn't always there and the pain isn't that bad, especially compared to upper abdomen pain.

Constant need to urinate. Even if I have just used the bathroom, I still have the urge and nothing but a drop comes out. This gets worse when lying down, especially on right side or stomach.

Lack of appetite.

Fatigue. Pretty much always exhausted. Though I'm sure this also comes from not eating nearly enough.

Stomach Bloating

1nhyig6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBudgetBrides/comments/1nhyig6/prewedding_trip_w_friends/,Pre-wedding Trip w/ Friends,"Hi All, my significant other and I are inviting our friends on a pre-wedding trip this November. We have 20 friends who are joining us on the trip, and we're now in the process of figuring out meals and activities. We would like to cover the cost of all of the dinners and activities. However, we're unsure what to do about breakfasts and lunches; there will be three breakfasts and two lunches. We were originally thinking of at least covering one lunch and one breakfast, but then we debated just covering all of them. Of note, the two of us are renting a house while our friends will be at a nearby hotel on the exact same block; this makes it easy for us to have a central, easily accessible location to meet and have meals.

One option is to cover all breakfasts and lunches, but I feel there are some cons for the guest experience. For instance, if we have coffee and pastries catered from a local bakery for breakfast, guests won't have the option of picking from the full drink menu (e.g., matcha, chai, lattes) or having breakfast sandwiches instead of pastries (I think the breakfast sandwiches will get cold during transport). My significant other and I will also need to pick up the food, which is not a huge deal but is a logistical item during a trip we'd ideally just enjoy. Additionally, I think people will get bored of eating at our rental house vs. experiencing the ambience of the local restaurants.

The other option is to head to coffee shops in the morning and to casual spots for lunch that involve ordering at the counter (these are the same places we would get catering from as they are the bulk of the breakfast and lunch options in the area and are well-rated) and either (1) insist on paying for everyone and then have our friends order one by one with us paying at the end or (2) just let our friends pay for their breakfasts and lunches couple by couple.

Overall, I want everyone to have a good, relaxing time, including myself, without worrying about who's paying or feeling weird about who's paying. Please weigh in- this is our first group trip so we have no idea how these things work. We definitely don't want to split costs at the end though- anything that involves splitting like dinners and activities- will definitely be covered by us in advance. Breakfasts and lunches are the only things where we're wondering if our guests will have the best time if we pay (with less flexibility on what they eat/drink) or they pay (with maximum flexibility).",1,1757971137.0,BigBudgetBrides,0,1.0,False

These did not have added water from the dried pineapple and so didn't have that soggyness abject made an overall better doughnut, but every bite with pineapple was... you know that feeling when you're eating trail mix and get a bite of dried pineapple and wish it was a better part of the trail mix? It was like that, except more, cause the tail mix was a doughnut. 

That being said, no fruit in the fritter would have accomplished the same no added moisture and would hand been strictly better. 

Wife was similarly not a fan. 

Although, I have to note that better fritters have failed to avoid the appearance of a cow pie and this one totally nailed the presentation.

I am coming to the end of the ""4th trimester"" and I feel like I learned so much (and still know nothing). But here are some of my reflections.

**Quick note:** As I prepared for my baby I did a lot of research, and there are many opinions out there around what choices parents should or shouldn't make. I am an Elementary teacher and thought I'd throw out there that when kiddos come to my class I cannot tell which one were VBAC or C-Section, which ones were breastfed vs. formula fed, which ones were sleep trained vs. not, or who co-slept vs. bassinet. So while these things are important, it is most important to do what is right for your family :)

**Top things I loved having at the hospital**: Snacks of food that had been forbidden while I was pregnant, adult diapers, a swaddle, a sound machine, my own blanket and pillow from home, & no visitors.

**First month (0-4 weeks)**: I thought I was prepared for all the emotions, pain, no sleep, anxiety. I did not expect to feel panic over this new reality/ mourn the life before. I loved my daughter but I also missed the ease and quiet of our home when it was just me and my husband. It is okay to feel this way, and now I cannot imagine our home without her in it.

Get out of the house. Even if its on the porch or in your driveway. We started going for walks and it was nice to get fresh air and break up the day.

Say no to things that make you uncomfortable, but also say yes. I struggled to accept help but I learned that people don't offer unless they want to . So say yes when a friend wants to bring food, or coffee, or walk your dog.

SIDS. Like every new parent SIDS was constantly on my mind. This Reddit helped.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/vz9kpi/a\_deep\_dive\_into\_sids/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/vz9kpi/a_deep_dive_into_sids/)

Finally some mantras that helped me (repeat this as often as you need)

\-They will cry, its not your fault, you can do this.

\-She's not giving you a hard time, she's having a hard time.

\-Stupider people than you do this.

**Second month (5-8 weeks)**: Oh you think you've got it figured out??? Lol nope! That 6 week growth spurt hit us hard. But also in this month those growth spurts started to give us smiles, and more alertness and we started to really meet our little potato, who no longer just slept, ate, and pooped.

We took our LO out to meet people this month, and to more stores. It was terrifying, but it helped to remind myself that I have to eventually, and the worst that happens is she cries. I feel very confident now going out and about with her. Find a carrier you like, and its okay to have a variety. We have 3 different carriers and I felt like we were overdoing it but I love them all for different reasons and switch them out often.

Vaccines feel scary (not knowing how they will they react, hearing that wail of pain) but its the best thing to keep your LO safe. We had Tylenol ready. For the most part our LO had no reaction other than her legs being sore that first day. Tip: have a bottle or boob ready for afterwards to comfort.

**Third month(9-12 weeks):** As we come into this third month I am amazed at how much my LO has grown in length, weight, & development. She looks at trees with wonder, she smiles when she sees her dad and myself. She is pinching things, and sucking on her hands. She also really committed to the witching hour and screams from 5-8 pretty consistently. But this month I truly fell in love with parenthood. There were still many hard days, where I cried with her, but I also started feeling more confident and found so many joys with spending time with my baby.

Verbalize when your partner is doing well (if they are). Also verbalize when you are struggling. I found myself thinking that the hormones or anxieties should be gone now but that is not the case and that is okay. Talk about it to someone.

**The world is going through a lot of change right now, and engineers have a front row seat.**

We're a small startup (Firebender) and would love to start the hard conversations and discussions on AI code assistants, both good and bad. It may be helpful to get the perspective of builders who are inside the San Francisco Bubble and who aren‚Äôt limited to large legal/marketing team approval at big companies. We can speak our minds.

The goal here is to help cut through AI hype bullsh\*t that we're being fed (spam bots on reddit, ads, hype marketers, C-suite force push, etc.), and understand what‚Äôs real, and what we‚Äôre seeing in the field. It'll be fun for us, and I think bridging the gap between silicon valley and the global community of engineers in r/androiddev is a good thing.

# AMA will be Wednesday 9/17/2025, the entire team will answer your questions from (9 AM to 5 PM PT).

You can address any one of us by first name if you want to, and the respective person will answer.

Massive shout out to u/borninbronx, for working with us, giving feedback on the plugin so early over discord. Looking forward to talking with y'all on Wednesday!

\*\* you can skip this next part, but is a good timeline on how Firebender got started and where we are now

# Background (timeline of coding assistance/history of Firebender)

Coding assistance is not a new concept. We've had [autocomplete models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion#Visual_Studio) since pre 2000's, ranging from autocomplete (Intellisense) and documentation search for finding answers (google/stackoverflow/old forums). This experience didn‚Äôt really see much change until a few things happened:

**2021 - GitHub Copilot**

The first mass adopted use case for language models, and not reliant on static code analysis or heuristic based tricks. It predicted the next set of chars of text (fill in the middle task) given your file and cursor position. This was a massive success, but there were many failures. Kite, a notable startup, shut down their business and the [post-mortem](https://kite.com/) in 2021, just a year before gpt-4. Its funny because if they started a few years later, they might have been a formidable startup up against Cursor and others in VSCode ecosystem.

**2022 - The spark**

September - I (Kevin) quit my first job to start a company, and moved to silicon valley from Houston, Texas after being tired of company bureaucracy, and doing engineering work that didn‚Äôt seem useful to anyone. On the side, I was building apps, games, the things I enjoyed about engineering.

November - Chat GPT hits 100M MAU in two months after launching

**2023 - I start using Cursor**

January - Aman (my cofounder, u/Wooden-Version4280) leaves his job to start a startup, and we start tinkering on different ideas. All of those ideas did not work and no one cared about them. But fortunately in December, YCombinator decided to take a risk on us and fund our company. I was at the end of my personal runway, and would have had to get a job if they did not fund us.

February - I became a power user of Cursor. At the time, I felt bad for the startup because I thought it was just a ‚Äúgpt wrapper‚Äù and that they were probably going to fail. But I loved using the tool and could not code without it.

**2024 - Demo day failure**

At the end of the YC batch, we attempted to raise capital from seed investors, to help us build an engineering team. We had over 70 investors reject us because our demo was buggy, we were exhausted, and we did not believe in the sales tool we were building; we eventually gave up raising.

Rather than trying to build a viable business, Aman and I decided that with the runway we had left, we should just do something crazy: We built an AI phone. We bought google pixel 8‚Äôs, rooted them, re-installed our fork of AOSP and play services working with a much better personal AI than Google assistant, and resell the phones for $100 more. We were not thinking about unit economics, or logistics, and just wanted to build a phone that we were proud of. We sold one phone.

Quickly though, we realized how difficult it would be to sell the next 10 phones, and we were losing momentum. At the same time we were complaining about how bad Gemini in Android Studio was compared to Cursor. We were having to switch between Cursor and Android Studio daily to work on the AOSP fork and AI accessibility apps. That's when we realized: *why don‚Äôt we just build Cursor for Android Studio*.

**Mid 2024 - Coffee with a hundred android engineers in San Francisco**

Unanimously, they all hate Gemini in Android Studio, mention that Copilot is average, and felt left behind because the VSCode ecosystem seemed to get all the attention.

Aman and I started building this idea ASAP. I also fly home and beg my younger brother Zach ( u/zootangerang ) to help us. We had 7 users at the time, and he‚Äôd have to move from Dallas, Texas and live with Aman and me in a cramped 2 bedroom apartment in San Francisco, work in the living room, while also rejecting many full time offers from companies like Jane Street and Old Mission Capital. I asked out of desperation with little to offer, and knew that no sane engineer would‚Äôve accepted this. But it turns out, I‚Äôm a good beggar, and Zach hated working at large companies.

In November, he flew with me to SF, and the three of us built the first coding agent in Android Studio (first public launch in [r/androiddev](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1jfeibu/i_built_a_simple_coding_agent_in_android_studio/)); it was based on Claude sonnet 3.5 at the time. We were extremely impressed by the results ourselves, but unsure how the wider community would react to it.

Fortunately, it went well!

1nhy5ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_iMango-/comments/1nhy5ig/best_collagen_peptides/,best collagen peptides,"**what the science actually says about collagen peptides**

been getting a lot of questions about collagen lately so figured i'd break down what the research actually shows vs the marketing hype. spent way too much time reading studies but here's what's legit.

**skin benefits ‚Äî this is where the evidence is strongest**

multiple clinical studies consistently show improvements in skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkle reduction after 8-12 weeks of daily collagen peptides. one big meta-analysis looked at 19 randomized trials with over 1,000 people and found significant improvements across the board. another study using fish collagen showed about 35% reduction in wrinkle depth after 12 weeks.

key thing ‚Äî these aren't dramatic transformations but the changes were measurable and noticeable compared to placebo groups. most studies used 2.5-10g daily. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742704/ ; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8176521/)

**joint support ‚Äî solid evidence here too**

this one surprised me. multiple trials with athletes, older adults, and people with mild arthritis show 5-10g daily over 3-6 months reduces pain and improves mobility. some participants could exercise longer without flare-ups. there's also research backing recovery from tendon injuries and ankle instability.

the mechanism makes sense ‚Äî your body breaks down the peptides and uses them to rebuild cartilage and connective tissue. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8521576/  ; https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/supplements-and-vitamins/can-collagen-supplements-help-arthritis) 

**other claims with mixed/limited evidence:**

* **muscle recovery:** few smaller studies found less soreness after workouts
* **bone health:** some signs of increased bone collagen synthesis but results vary
* **hair/nails/general ""anti-aging"":** evidence is pretty weak. harvard and bbc both point out most beauty trials are industry-funded or use multi-ingredient formulas so you can't isolate what's actually from collagen (https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/considering-collagen-drinks-and-supplements-202304122911 ; https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250214-do-collagen-supplements-work)

**safety and dosing** no serious side effects across dozens of trials. worst reported is mild digestive upset in some people. generally considered safe for long-term use. effective doses seem to be 2.5-15g daily depending on what you're targeting.

**practical advice for choosing products**

look for:

* **hydrolyzed collagen peptides** (better absorption than regular collagen)
* **types I & III** for skin benefits, **type II** for joints
* **third-party tested** if you care about purity
* **no unnecessary fillers** unless you want the extras

**products that match the research doses and quality**

**1. collagen peptides powder unflavored**

* 11g hydrolyzed collagen per serving (types I, II, III) from grass-fed sources
* clean: no soy, gluten, gmos, or sweeteners. keto friendly
* dissolves completely in coffee/smoothies without changing taste
* good all-around option that hits effective doses from studies \[link\]

**2. micro ingredients multi collagen peptides powder (chocolate)**

* covers types I, II, III, V, X (bovine, chicken, marine, eggshell)
* includes vitamin c (helps collagen synthesis), biotin, hyaluronic acid
* 11g per serving, tastes like actual hot cocoa
* best if you want added nutrients and can't stand unflavored powder \[link\]

**3. bubs naturals collagen peptides powder**

* 18g protein, 20g collagen per serving (types I & III)
* grass-fed bovine, minimal processing
* nsf certified for sport (tested for banned substances)
* higher dose if you're targeting joint recovery or doing intense training \[link\]

|**product**|**collagen types**|**extras**|**dose**|**best for**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[unflavored](https://nelsonfoto.com/dp-B07KX6P6D6)|I, II, III|none|11g|general skin/joint support|
|[multi collagen (chocolate)](https://nelsonfoto.com/dp-B0D68JXS1L)|I, II, III, V, X|vitamin c, biotin, hyaluronic acid|11g|skin focus + taste matters|
|bubs naturals|I, III|none|20g|athletes, joint recovery|

**realistic expectations**

* **skin:** most people notice changes around 8-12 weeks if they're going to
* **joints:** can take 3-6 months for significant improvement
* **timing:** doesn't matter when you take it, just be consistent
* **mixing:** works fine in coffee, smoothies, even baking

**who should skip it**

* if you already eat tons of bone broth, organ meats, etc you might not need extra
* people with kidney issues should check with their doc first
* if you're expecting dramatic ""fountain of youth"" results, save your money

bottom line: for skin hydration/elasticity and joint comfort, there's legitimate research backing collagen peptides. just don't expect miracles and give it at least 2-3 months to see if it works for you.

anyone been using these consistently? curious what people are actually noticing in real life vs what the studies show.

1nhxx1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nhxx1e/im_safer_under_the_blankets/,I'm safer under the blankets,"The ritual began when I was seven, in that old house on Maple Street. The house where my grandmother lived before us, where she died in the very room that became mine. My parents never told me that part until years later, thinking it would frighten me. As if I wasn't already terrified enough.

My bedroom was at the end of a long, narrow hallway, and my bed sat in the corner where two walls met. The room had been painted a cheerful yellow, sunflower bright, my mother called it, but no amount of paint could mask what lived in the shadows there. I discovered early that walls were friends... Solid, predictable, unable to hide anything behind them. It was the open spaces that terrified me.

The dark wasn't just absence of light in that room. It was presence. It breathed with a rhythm that didn't match mine, exhaling cold air that raised goosebumps along my arms even under heavy quilts. The darkness seemed to pool in the corners, thick as syrup, and sometimes I swear I could see it moving, shifting like smoke given form.

But I learned to manage the dark, to negotiate with it through my nightly routine. Each step was crucial, learned through trial and terror.

First, the legs. Always tucked up, knees to chest, never dangling over the mattress edge. I learned this rule the hard way, the night something brushed against my ankle as it hung innocently over the side. Not a touch, touches are warm, human. This was cold, deliberate, like fingers made of winter air trailing across my skin. The contact lasted only seconds, but it felt like ice water running through my veins. Sometimes I can still feel the cold...

When I yanked my foot back under the covers, gasping, I heard what might have been disappointed sighing from beneath the bed. A sound like wind through dead leaves, but there was no wind in that sealed room. I lay there trembling, listening to small sounds. Rustling, shifting, as if something large was rearranging itself in the confined space below my mattress.

That was the night I understood the bed wasn't just furniture. It was an island, and the floor around it was an ocean filled with things that waited for careless limbs to dangle within reach.

The blanket became my fortress wall. Pulled tight to my throat, tucked around my shoulders, creating a barrier between me and whatever watched from the shadows. Under that cotton sanctuary, I was invisible, or so I desperately hoped. The rules were simple: as long as no part of me extended beyond the blanket's protection, I was safe. But the blanket had to be perfect, sealed tight like a cocoon. I was scared that even the smallest gap might let something in.

I spent countless nights adjusting the edges, making sure every inch of skin was covered. My mother would find me in the morning, drenched in sweat despite the cool autumn air. She worried I would suffocate, but suffocation seemed preferable to whatever waited in the exposed air of that room.

But the wall... That was the hardest lesson of all.

I used to sleep facing inward, toward the wall, thinking if I didn't see them, they couldn't see me. Foolish child logic. As if my seven-year-old eyes could spot danger in that absolute darkness anyway. But one night, as I lay there staring into the void, trying to make sense of shapes that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them, I felt it.

Breath on the back of my neck, slow and measured, far too close to be my own.

The exhale was cold. Each breath seemed to last forever, and I could feel the moisture from it condensing on my skin. The breathing was patient, rhythmic, as if whatever stood behind me had all the time in the world.

I was too terrified to turn around, convinced that if I moved, whatever stood behind me would know I was awake. So I lay frozen, every muscle locked in place, feeling that steady breathing against my skin. I tried to convince myself it was a dream, but dreams don't leave condensation on your neck. Dreams don't make the air temperature drop ten degrees.

I counted the breaths. Twenty-seven. Each one, a small death, each one confirming that I was not alone in that room. When it finally stopped, the silence was somehow worse than the breathing had been. At least the breathing let me know where it was. Now, It could've been anywhere. Now, It could've been right in front of me.

The next night, I turned to face the room, back firmly placed on the wall. It couldn't reach my neck that way. It was better that way, I told myself. Safer. 

The wall couldn't hide anything, it was solid, reliable, painted the same cheerful yellow as always. I could press my head against the cool plaster and imagine I was somewhere else, somewhere safe. But even with my back buried against the wall, I could feel eyes on my neck. Patient eyes. Waiting me to turn in my sleep.

The wall became my security blanket, but it was a false comfort. Because while I couldn't see what watched me, it could see me perfectly. I was like an ostrich with its head in the sand, thinking invisibility worked both ways.

Sometimes, in those small hours when night is deepest, I would hear movement in the room. Soft footsteps that didn't quite match human rhythm, too slow, too deliberate, with an odd shuffling quality that suggested the walker wasn't entirely comfortable with the act of walking. The sound would circle my bed, patient and methodical, like a predator testing the boundaries of its prey's defenses.

Other times, I heard the whisper of something being dragged across carpet. Long, smooth strokes, as if something heavy was being pulled back and forth across my bedroom floor. I tried to convince myself it was tree branches scraping against the house, but we lived on a treeless street, and the sound came from inside the room.

The worst nights were when I heard voices.

They started as whispers, so soft I thought they might be the wind or the old house settling. But gradually, they became clearer, more distinct. Conversations in a language I didn't recognize, words that seemed to crawl into my ears and nest there like spiders. The voices were never quite human, too hollow, too echoing, as if they were coming from somewhere very deep and very dark.

Once, I swear I heard my name whispered in a voice that sounded almost like my grandmother's, but wrong somehow, like an echo of an echo of something that was never quite human to begin with. The voice called to me, patient and loving, trying to coax me into turning around.

""Sarah,"" it whispered, drawing out the syllables like a song. ""Sarah, look at me. I have something to show you.""

I squeezed my eyes shut so tight I saw stars, pressed myself harder against the wall until the plaster left marks on my forehead. I knew, with the absolute certainty that only children possess, that opening my eyes would be the last thing I ever did.

I never looked. Never ever looked. Opening my eyes in curiosity was a foolish mistake I did back in the days. Not after the time i saw... her. Blood gushing from her back, pooling the ground, looking at me with big black eyes.

The rules of the room were everything. No limbs outside the blanket. Face the room. Stay perfectly still. Don't respond to voices, no matter how familiar they sound. Don't acknowledge the breathing, the footsteps, the dragging sounds. Pretend to sleep, even when sleep was impossible.

But the entity, for that's what I came to think of it as, was learning too.

As weeks passed, it grew bolder. The breathing became closer, so close I could feel individual droplets of moisture hitting my face. The footsteps grew heavier, more confident. And the voices... the voices began to mimic people I knew with disturbing accuracy.

It spoke with my father's voice, telling me bedtime stories I'd never heard. It whispered in my teacher's voice, praising me for being such a good, quiet student. Once, it spent an entire night speaking in my grandmother's voice, the grandmother who had died in this very room, telling me about the old country and promising that if I just turned around, she would show me pictures.

But I held fast to the rules.

My parents thought I was going through a phase. ""All children are afraid of monsters,"" my mother would say, smoothing my hair and speaking in the bright, dismissive tone adults use when they want to make something go away. She would check under my bed with exaggerated thoroughness, look in my closet, behind my door. ""See? Nothing there.""

But she never felt those cold fingers testing the edges of the blanket, searching for gaps with the persistence of water finding cracks in a dam. She never heard the breathing that wasn't breathing, or felt the weight of something settling at the foot of the bed, just outside the protective circle of cotton and polyester.

She never saw the footprints.

I found them one morning, pressed into the carpet around my bed. They were strange, too long and narrow to be human, with what looked like claw marks at the tips. They circled my bed three times before disappearing at the wall where I pressed my face each night.

I tried to show my parents, but by the time they came to look, the footprints were gone. The carpet showed no sign of disturbance. They exchanged one of those looks, the kind parents share when they're deciding whether their child needs therapy.

""Maybe we should move your bed away from the wall,"" my father suggested. ""Give you more space.""

The suggestion filled me with such terror I couldn't speak. More space meant more vulnerability, more places for it to hide, more directions from which it could approach. The wall was my anchor, my one and only solid point in a that goddamn room.

I threw such a tantrum that they never mentioned moving the bed again.

Winter came early that year, and with it, the activity in my room intensified. The breathing became constant, no longer limiting itself to the deep hours of night. I could feel eyes on me from the moment I entered my bedroom until I left for school the next morning. The temperature in the room dropped so dramatically that my parents called a heating repair service, but the technician found nothing wrong with the system.

""Probably just air circulation issues,"" he said, but I saw him glance around the room with troubled eyes, rubbing his arms as if he too felt the unnatural cold.

The voices multiplied. Now instead of one speaker, I heard whole conversations, debates conducted in that same hollow, echoing tone. They discussed me like I was an object, a puzzle to be solved.

""She never looks,"" one voice complained. ""Always the wall, always hiding.""

""Patience,"" another replied. ""She'll turn eventually. They always do.""

""What if she doesn't? What if she grows up still hiding?""

A pause, then laughter like wind chimes made of bone. ""She can't hide forever. And we have so much time.""

I was never sure if they knew I could hear them.

One time, I started sleeping with a pillow over my head, but somehow the voices found their way through goose down and cotton, seeping into my ears like smoke. I began to dread bedtime with a fear so profound it made me physically sick. I would vomit before going upstairs, my body rejecting the very idea of another night in that room.

My parents took me to doctors. Pediatricians who prescribed vitamins, specialists who tested for everything from food allergies to neurological disorders. Nothing they found explained the nausea, the weight loss, the dark circles under my eyes that made me look like a tiny ghost haunting my own life.

One doctor suggested I might be experiencing night terrors, and prescribed medication that was supposed to help me sleep more deeply. But deeper sleep meant being less alert, less able to maintain the rules that kept me safe. The first night I took the medication, I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness despite every instinct screaming at me to stay awake.

I woke up lying on my back, facing the ceiling, my arms outside the blanket.

I had never been so terrified in my life. The rules had been broken, my defenses compromised, and I was alive. The thing that haunted my room could have done anything while I lay there, drugged and helpless. 

But I was untouched, unharmed.

I felt something odd too. I was actually not tired for once.

That was when I figured the most terrifying truth of all: It didn't want to hurt me while I was sleeping.

It wanted me awake. It wanted me aware. It fed on my fear, my vigilance, my nightly ritual of terror. I wasn't protecting myself with my rules, I was participating in some cosmic game where I was both player and prize. When I was asleep, they couldn't get me, they couldn't feed off of me, they couldn't hurt me.

But knowing this didn't make the fear go away. If anything, it made it worse. Because now I understood that every night I lay there, pressed against that wall, I was giving it exactly what it wanted. And yet I couldn't stop. The alternative, facing it, looking at it, acknowledging its presence, was unthinkable.

Three months later, we moved.

My parents never gave me a real reason for the sudden departure. They spoke vaguely about job opportunities and better school districts, but I saw the relief in their eyes when the moving truck pulled away from Maple Street. They had felt it too, maybe not consciously, but on some primal level that recognized wrongness when it pressed against the boundaries of normal life.

We moved to the big city of our state. My new doctor was actually more attentive too! I told him everything. What I saw, what it was like to go to sleep, what I heard... He took notes and told me he'd give me a stronger sleeping pill that might cause some side effects. Moreover, our new house was bright and modern, with large windows and open floor plans. My new bedroom was in the middle of the house, surrounded by other rooms, other people. There were no dark corners, no shadows that seemed deeper than they should be. The first night I slept there, I forgot to follow the rules.

I woke up facing the room, arms flung wide, one leg dangling off the edge of the bed, blanket on the ground. And nothing happened. No cold breath, no whispered voices, no skeletal fingers testing my skin. Just normal darkness, the kind that was simply absence of light rather than presence of something else.

I cried with relief.

For years, I thought I had escaped. I slept normally, dated normally, went to college and built a career and fell in love. Eventually, I figured I didn't need to take my sleeping pills anymore. They were doing weird things to my body anyway. I stopped taking them. I convinced myself that whatever had haunted the house on Maple Street had been tied to that place, locked within those walls like a ghost in chains.

But places aren't the only things that can be haunted.

The house on Maple Street is gone now, demolished years ago to make room for a shopping center. I went to see the construction site once, drawn by morbid curiosity and a need to prove to myself that it was truly over. Where my bedroom had been, they built a small coffee shop with cheerful yellow walls‚Äîthe same shade as my childhood room.

I ordered a latte and sat at the table that occupied roughly the same space where my bed used to be. Around me, normal people conducted normal business, students studying, couples chatting, office workers checking email. Nothing supernatural, nothing wrong. Just the ordinary hum of human activity.

But as I sat there, I felt the familiar chill creeping up my spine. The coffee shop seemed to grow quieter, the cheerful chatter fading to a distant murmur. And then, barely audible under the noise of espresso machines and casual conversation, I heard it.

Breathing. Patient and cold, with that same smell of rotting autumn leaves.

I left without finishing my coffee.

That night, for the first time in twenty years, I returned to the old rules. Legs tucked tight, back to the wall, blanket pulled high. My husband asked if I was feeling alright, and I lied and said I was just cold.

Because I had learned something terrifying in that coffee shop: some things aren't tied to places. Some things are tied to people. And whatever had chosen me in that yellow bedroom on Maple Street had never really let me go.

It had simply been waiting for the right moment to remind me that I belonged to it.

Now, lying in bed each night with my grown-up husband sleeping beside me, I still feel it. That presence. Patient as winter, cold as forgotten graves, persistent as hunger. It whispers to me sometimes, in voices I recognize and voices I don't. It tells me stories about the other children who learned the rules, who spent their nights pressed against walls and hidden under blankets.

It tells me about the ones who eventually looked.

I keep my legs tucked tight. I keep my back to the wall. I keep the blanket pulled high.

Sometimes, in the deepest part of night, when my husband's snoring is steady and the world is quiet, I hear something else breathing too. Something that has been waiting patiently for thirty years, counting down the nights until I finally get tired of hiding.

Until I finally turn around.

But not tonight. Tonight I'll follow the rules, just like I always have, just like I always will.

Because the alternative is unthinkable and somewhere in the darkness behind me, I know it's smiling. After all, I learned long ago that some childhood fears never leave you. They just learn to wait for your vulnerable moment.

I think this one in particular was some kind of point and click game that involved some superhero who had to stop this tentacled alien who I guess kinda looked like Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons. I think it was on Teletoon's website?

It was basically a point and click game or at least just you being given choices on how to proceed with the story, and making the wrong choice could make you lose and restart. The game itself was only like 7 minutes long so it wasn't much of a loss. Whatever you picked it resulted in some zany mishaps so that kind of humor.

What I do remember is you entered your name before starting. There was some scene where the alien villain got up and made himself some toast, though he'd just spit it out not liking the taste. Not sure why but you could make him eat the toast again and again until he got angry and broke the fourth wall telling you to stop (by the name you entered) and proceeded to the next scene.

The Superhero also did some stuff as he was the kind to always ""accidentally"" save the day. His costume was mostly orange. He had this friend who was this punk girl but here's the weird part. I remember this scene where the alien breaks into her house while she sleeps to take something. She would wake up and you'd have the choice to check what was making the noise or make a cup of coffee first.

Now if you sensibly chose to check the noise, the girl would be grabbed by the alien and you'd lose. No it wasn't a tentacle hentai don't worry... uh anyways. You had to make the coffee first because I guess the alien would have already gotten what he wanted and left by the time she was done.

The weird part, you could make this girl drink multiple cups of coffee. If she drank too much, she would die (or I guess pass out?) and you'd have to reset. Whew these games had morbid humor.

# Title: How Do Casino Bonuses Actually Work? A No-BS Guide to Wagering & The Fine Print.



Hey Reddit,

If you've ever looked at online casinos, you've seen the flashy ads: ""100% BONUS UP TO $500!"" or ""GET 200 FREE SPINS!"" It sounds like free money, but we all know there's usually a catch. So, how do casino bonuses work, really?

I've been around this block a few times and wanted to break it down in simple terms, because understanding the rules is the difference between having fun and feeling ripped off.

**TL;DR: A casino bonus is a promotional tool to give you more playtime, not free cash. You must complete a ""wagering requirement"" (bet a certain amount of money) before you can withdraw the bonus or any winnings from it.**



# The Main Types of Bonuses You'll See



First, let's cover the basics. Most bonuses fall into one of these categories:

* **Deposit Match Bonus:** This is the most common one. The casino matches a percentage of your deposit with bonus money. A ""100% match up to $200"" means if you deposit $200, they give you an extra $200 in bonus funds, so you have $400 to play with.
* **Free Spins:** Instead of bonus cash, you get a set number of spins on a specific slot machine. What you win from these spins usually turns into bonus money, which then has its own wagering requirement.
* **No Deposit Bonus:** This is the ""free sample"" of the casino world. You get a small bonus (like $10 or 20 free spins) just for signing up. The catch? The wagering requirements are often extremely high.



# The Most Important Part: Wagering Requirements (The 'Catch')



This is the concept that trips everyone up. A wagering requirement is a multiplier that tells you how many times you have to play through a bonus before it turns into real, withdrawable cash.

**Here's the best analogy:** The casino isn't giving you a free sandwich. They're giving you a coupon for a ""free"" sandwich, but you have to buy 30 coffees first.

Let's use a real example:

* You get a **$100 bonus**.
* The terms state a **30x wagering requirement**.

The math is: **$100 (Bonus) x 30 (Wagering) = $3,000.**

This means you have to place a total of **$3,000 in bets** before that initial $100 bonus and any money you won with it becomes yours to keep. It doesn't mean you have to lose $3,000. It's the total amount of wagers placed‚Äîwins and losses count towards the total.

**‚ö†Ô∏è The BIG TRAP:** Some casinos apply the wagering requirement to **(Bonus + Deposit)**. Using the example above, if you deposited $100 to get the $100 bonus, the calculation becomes ($100 Deposit + $100 Bonus) x 30 = **$6,000!** This makes a huge difference, so always check the terms.



# Other Sneaky Rules in the T&Cs to Watch For



It's not just about wagering. Here are other rules designed to trip you up:

* **Game Contribution:** Not all games are equal. Bets on slots usually count 100% towards wagering. But bets on table games like Blackjack or Roulette might only contribute 10% or even 0%, because the house edge is lower.
* **Max Bet:** You can't just bet your entire $100 bonus on a single spin. There's almost always a max bet rule (e.g., $5 per spin) while a bonus is active. Break this rule, and they can void all your winnings.
* **Time Limits:** Bonuses don't last forever. You usually have 7-30 days to meet the wagering requirements before the bonus funds expire.
* **Restricted Games:** Some high RTP (Return to Player) slots are often excluded from bonus play entirely.



# So, Are Bonuses a Scam?



Not necessarily. The best way to view a casino bonus is as a tool to **extend your entertainment and playtime**, not as a get-rich-quick scheme. It gives you a bigger bankroll to try out new games and have fun for longer. Beating the wagering requirement and cashing out is possible, but it requires a good amount of luck.

**My Pro Tips:**

1. **Always Read the T&Cs.** Seriously. Especially the wagering, game contribution, and max bet rules.
2. **Look for Low Wagering.** Anything 35x or under is considered pretty standard. Anything over 50x is very difficult to clear.
3. **You Can Always Decline a Bonus.** If you don't want to be tied down by the rules, just opt-out or contact support to have it removed before you start playing.

One day, I smoked a joint while drinking a Monster. About an hour later, I had to sprint like crazy to catch the bus. I got on completely exhausted, and after about 10 minutes sitting there, I suddenly had a presyncope episode (felt like I was about to faint). It lasted around 15 minutes, but I managed to stay conscious by focusing on my breathing.

Later that same day, I even smoked another joint with a friend and felt completely fine, like nothing had happened.

But in the following days, maybe a week later, I started feeling strange. Not exactly anxiety, but a weird discomfort in my body, like I wasn‚Äôt at ease.

Then came the turning point: one night at home I smoked from a bong, and I overdid it. That triggered the worst anxiety attack of my life. I was walking back and forth in my room for almost two hours, on the phone with a friend just to feel safe. I honestly thought I was going to die from the anxiety. Eventually, it passed, and I fell asleep.

But after that day, things changed completely. From then on, I started to feel anxiety every single day:
	‚Ä¢	On the bus
	‚Ä¢	Walking down the street
	‚Ä¢	First thing in the morning
	‚Ä¢	In class
	‚Ä¢	Whenever I didn‚Äôt get 8 hours of sleep
	‚Ä¢	Even when drinking coffee or alcohol
	‚Ä¢	Even while exercising

Everything triggered my anxiety.

Fast forward to today: the intense daily anxiety is gone, and I‚Äôve been slowly recovering. I can drink a little alcohol, smoke, even push myself at the gym again. But there‚Äôs still one thing left: my sensitivity is way higher than before. Any stimulus (coffee, alcohol, weed, even stress) hits me way harder than it used to, like my body just multiplies the effects, in other words, I get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúhammered‚Äùwith ease like I can‚Äôt finish a cup of coffee without feeling already stimulated or even a single beer, I know it‚Äôs hard to believe but yes, I get drunk with a single can beer (330ml)  that has like 2% alcohol.

Has anyone else experienced this? Did you ever get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? (I read the rules and I don‚Äôt ask for medical advice and I‚Äôm neither promoting drugs, I just want to know if someone had gone through something similar)

The platform was underneath the actual station, we would need to take an escalator up to the ground floor. I looked down both tracks and saw a few people waiting around and sunlight spilling in from both directions.

Even under the station like this the heat was almost unbearable, I could only guess how bad it must have been for the Jaslips here, if there was any. The ice worlders would be killed by this heat unless they had those self-cooling suits. Which gave me the idea to look for krev ones, just so I could get out of this misery.

‚ÄúYeah, just, again thank you I was about to tick over there.‚Äù

I let Edward lead the way this time and we soon entered the station properly, thankfully using the escalator and not having to climb stairs in the miserable heat. The station itself was a lot quieter than the first but not by much, instead of a flurry of motion and green, there wasn‚Äôt much diversity here. I saw humans and trombil chatting while a lone krev was hurriedly following what I assume to be his exchange partner around.

The overall atmosphere here was completely different and not all hustle and bustle, like the last station we just left, this was simpler and quieter which was a nice reprieve from all of it really.

Though I couldn‚Äôt help but have the distinct feeling that I was being watched from somewhere.

Moving through the station was a simple task, with fewer people here it made walking a little more enjoyable. I kept glancing at Edward making sure that he was alright, but he never showed any overt signs of panic, though my worry still remained.

I could tell that we were nearing the exit again, the heat emanating from outside somehow feeling like a wall of warm air signifying where the air conditioned area ended and the heat started. I prepared myself again to be bombarded by the heat of this world‚Äôs sun, stepping outside I could hardly believe my eyes at what I saw.

In every direction there was humans, more humans than any other alien in sight. I saw some mingling outside a caf√©, some walking down a street with strollers in front of them and even one sleeping on a blanket in a garden.

‚ÄòThere‚Äôs more humans here than any I‚Äôve ever seen before, it‚Äôs like a fantasy story.‚Äô

I was reminded of a genre of fairytale stories that were popular for pups, the sorts of ones that had a world of talking obors. It brought back memories of my parents when I was really young watching the show with them.

I miss them still.

Edward had stopped when he noticed I wasn‚Äôt next to him.

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù He said coming back and asking.

‚ÄúYeah, just haven‚Äôt seen this many humans in the one spot before.‚Äù

He looked around after I said that and probably only noticed himself.

‚ÄúActually yeah, I hadn‚Äôt noticed. I suppose you‚Äôd have to get used to it eventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause of Earth surviving?‚Äù

‚ÄúSort of yeah.‚Äù

I imagined a flood of new human settlers occupying the rest of the city, probably outnumbering the rest of us quiet easily. But I couldn‚Äôt help letting my imagination run wild with speculations about it, or what could happen because of it.

The adorable primates moving here would be a dream come true for me and probably a lot more krev. I know that I lucked out in the exchange program and was partnered with Edward. The memories of it struck again and I refocused myself on what was important and to be here and not daydreaming.

‚ÄòProbably more infrastructure work for me.‚Äô The thought sobered me up proper.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get going anyway, the place won‚Äôt be open the entire day.‚Äù Edward said both of us now continuing our walk when the thought struck me.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll be people moving here soon, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably not for a while, well not a significant amount of people anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why did you say that I would need to get used to it soon?‚Äù I asked, I looked up at him and he stopped for a second before walking again almost making me trip over my tail turning around.

‚ÄúYeah, about that, I sort of forgot to say, but I‚Äôm thinking of going back.‚Äù

‚Ä¶My head blanked for a moment before realising what he was saying, that my friend was going to go away for maybe forever and I would never see him again. But he was getting the help he needs then, if he goes, he gets better and maybe I could visit someday in the future.

‚ÄúWhy are you looking like that?‚Äù He said turning to me and stopping the both of us.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs-it‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù I tried to keep my voice steady but apparently failed at it. He removed his glasses now and stooped down to my level and stared at me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere without you or Breeve, that‚Äôs the conclusion I came to. I know that I have problems, I can‚Äôt handle being around krev I don‚Äôt know or‚Ä¶ yeah, but I‚Äôm not going to leave either of you.‚Äù He said staring at me, trying to get the point across.

‚ÄúBut I want you to get better, if you go with Breeve. I know you‚Äôll both be okay, and you‚Äôll be among your own people and not have to worry about us anymore harming you anymore.‚Äù I announced dejectedly. I know he needs this and I‚Äôm not going to stop him; I just felt my heart twisting in my chest not being able to look at him anymore.

I didn‚Äôt know what to think, but I knew that I was not going to stop him from getting help even though it hurt, I closed my eyes in an effort to calm myself again after having said what I needed to say.

I felt a pair of arms attempts wrap me in a hug, my eyes shot open to see that it was Edward wrapping his arms around me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not going anywhere without you or Breeve. It‚Äôs non-negotiable to me.‚Äù He said quietly. ‚ÄúI need you both, you‚Äôre my friends and I want to be there for you like you are for me.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything back to him, I just wrapped my own arms around him and hugged him back. I didn‚Äôt know what to say other than think that my friend wasn‚Äôt leaving me, but the nagging thought that he wouldn‚Äôt get better lingered. He soon let go and I, a second after that wanting to hold onto the human a little longer.

‚ÄúBesides, if humans do come here from Earth, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll probably be a few therapists with them.‚Äù He offered in a way to alleviate my worry for his mental health.

‚ÄúS-sure.‚Äù Is all I could reply with and meekly at that.

‚ÄúRight, let‚Äôs get going again, I think we‚Äôre drawing a few stares.‚Äù He said making me look around.

He was right about people staring at us, the few that I had seen earlier were trying to go about their business. Though there were a few I noticed had stern looks where focusing on me specifically, my only guess was that they were a few of the miners that Edward had worked with that still hated the krev.

‚ÄúI think it would be best.‚Äù I said before we started walking again.

We didn‚Äôt say anything, I felt a little lighter now, but I couldn‚Äôt help the nagging worry about the people staring at me before. I heard the expression ‚Äòif looks could kill‚Äô and thought it was talking about humans dressing up in cute outfits so that they could kill us with cuteness, though I never heard of that happening before. But now I‚Äôm starting to think it was meant as a saying for something else.

‚ÄúDo you know where we‚Äôre going?‚Äù I asked once we were out of eye shot of the other humans.

‚ÄúYeah, it should be round this corner here, can‚Äôt miss it really.‚Äù He said as we crossed over at a pair of traffic lights even though there weren‚Äôt any cars to be seen. Overall, the place almost seemed deserted of any traffic, it took my mind off the heat wondering where everyone went when we rounded the corner.

This street was just a walkway with a sort of plaza type area. I could see that some restaurant was nearby with a few patrons sitting outside under some umbrellas. Other stores nearby seemed to have been made in mind for the humans, since I saw textiles, they would usually wear but it seemed like these extremely varied between stores.

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know which was cuter, the picture with a human wearing some sportswear kicking a ball mid pose or the prim suit another store was advertising.‚Äô

¬†I imagined that since the area is for humans they would have these stores here instead of having to face us I guess.

We walked for a little further, the street having a slight bend to it as I spotted some sort of spiral machine thingy sitting outside another shop. We stopped outside of it and I peered in through the glass window, I saw three chairs and a female human sitting in a corner behind a counter chatting to another who was wearing an apron of sorts.

Edward entered through the sliding door, me following behind him. I looked around and they had a mirror facing the chairs and grooming implements. Along the window was a blush bench with a stand for magazines at one side and a small, planted pot on the other. I noticed that there was music playing in the background, not really being listened to but I suppose it was to fill in for the quietness.

‚ÄúWillow.‚Äù Edward said announcing himself to the pair, I waited back to let him talk.

‚ÄúEh, Edward, is that you?‚Äù The lady in the apron said back, I noticed that she had her hair tied up into a cute little bun at the back of her head as she turned around to talk to Edward.

‚ÄúAye, it is. Well, it is I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúAck, how long has it been?‚Äù She offered a light hug.

‚ÄúI think around six months, I think.‚Äù He offered a little unsurely.

‚ÄúFrom the look of you, probably that and then some more. You in for a hair cut or just a social call?‚Äù

‚ÄúHaircut, desperately need it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, just hop in the chair there and we‚Äôll get started.‚Äù She said before gesturing to one of the chairs.

Edward sat down in it while who I assumed was the hairdresser called Willow grabbed a few items from another bench and placed then in front of the chair at the base of the glass. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and decided that I would stay quiet and sit on the bench and watch what was happening.

Willow approached and draped a black sheet over Edward, and I could only think that he‚Äôs wearing even more textiles in this heat. He was probably miserable right now.

‚ÄúSo, just getting the usual touch up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúShort on the sides and back while leaving a bit on the top, is that alright?‚Äù She asked again, reminding me of the first time I saw Edward. His hair was a lot shorter, and from then to now I think he just let it grow out like I saw a few of his species do.

Edward nodded looking around the place using the mirror before glancing at me and around again. Willow grabbed a pair of scissors from the pouch on her apron and a comb I saw the human use in media to straighten their hair.

When she brought both near Edward‚Äôs head, I saw him visibly tense up from it, I couldn‚Äôt see his hands but from the way he looked he was probably gripping the seat‚Äôs arm rests tightly. Willow for her part stopped and looked at him a little funny before making some small talk.

He was staring directly at me now and I offered my best imitation of a human smile and tried to offer some moral support.

‚ÄúSo, what have you been up to lately?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúUh-oh, you know, just sort of around I suppose.‚Äù He offered back, relaxing a little bit before training his gaze on me in the mirror.

‚ÄúLast I heard if you, you were at some sort of thing with the exchange?‚Äù She offered, using the comb gently to straighten and then cut the long strands of hair, letting them fall to the floor. Each time she did so, I noticed that Edward would twitch slightly. Probably from the noise being so close to his ears.

‚ÄúUh, yeah. I was on Avor for a little bit.‚Äù He offered back.

‚ÄúOh, and how was that? It must have been chaos with all the krev around you?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúUm, sort of.‚Äù He said quietly, no doubt remembering some unpleasant things.

‚ÄúI guess that this is your partner here?‚Äù She glanced in the mirror at me before continuing cutting away at the strands a small pile starting to form at the base of the chair.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Cruth and yeah, I was partnered with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù I said waving a clawed hand toward the mirror.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs good to know that you‚Äôre making friends again.‚Äù

She started working at the top of the head now, using the comb and then shortening the lengths using her hand and making careful cuts. From what I could see, she was getting rid of a lot of hair, but it looked better so far. Edward was making glances at me continuing the small talk he was having, and I decided to look around only to make eye contact with the other human here.

She was making that stern face I saw some of the humans doing earlier and I broke the glance immediately getting an uneasy feeling from it and looked somewhere else. Willow had finished what she was doing with the scissors having remove a large portion of hair before grabbing¬† hair clipper off a bench nearby.

She turned it on a low thrum coming from it and brought it up to cut the remaining hair. I stared back at Edward and gave an imitation of a thumbs up while he took slow deliberate breaths in an effort to calm himself. Willow noticed and turned to look at me before slowly and very carefully started to cut the hair. I took a quick glance over at the other human and found them still staring daggers at me.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to panic Edward, it‚Äôs just a haircut, nothing else.‚Äù Willow offered, probably seeing how much distress he was in. She started to cut around the sides letting it fall to the floor only leaving a very short coat of fur around his head. Before changing the head on the clippers and cutting the top as well, though leaving a bit more fur on top.

Once she had done that, she places the clippers down on the bench before starting to use the comb and scissors again to tidy up the rest.

‚ÄúDo you want anything done with the beard?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh-um. Just maybe keep a little length in it.‚Äù He offered back maintaining his breathing.

‚ÄúWill do.‚Äù She said grabbing a different pair of clippers and started to take the length off that too.

‚ÄúSo, are you getting it touched up for going home?‚Äù She asked out of the blue.

‚ÄúNo, I just needed the hair cut done really, I was starting to feel like I needed a change.‚Äù He offered back now glancing around the room and not staring directly at me.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt go wrong with a bit of change, you‚Äôll look like a new man after this.‚Äù She said slowly working the implement around the crook of his neck.

It continued for a while as she detailed the rest of Edward‚Äôs hair before brushing the remaining clipping off him and removing the sheet and asking.

‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs that look?‚Äù

He inspected it in the mirror, it looked like some of the photos I had seen in a human fashion magazine. The people having a similar look to what Edward had currently and I really liked it. I could see the hair on the sides melded into the hair he had on the top, it being swept back and the beard now being maintained and cut shorter a lot shorter, to the point I was able to see the skin underneath as it grew higher on his cheeks.

‚ÄòI really want to pet him and be able to run my claws through the fur on his head.‚Äô

I thought to myself and tried to hide the scree I was doing internally.

‚ÄúLooks great, thank you.‚Äù He said standing up, running a hand through the hair, like I wanted to do so badly. ‚ÄúHow much do I owe you?‚Äù he asked walking over to the counter and bringing out the holopad.

‚ÄúJust this much here.‚Äù The other human who had been staring daggers at me for the last ten minutes said.

Edward tapped the pad, and I got up to get ready to go, not being able to take my eyes of the back of his head. It just looked so pet able to me, I really wish I could comb his hair. Maybe he would let me sometime?

What was I thinking? He didn‚Äôt need that sort of treatment, he needed to be reminded that he‚Äôs not just some primate to be coddled. I tore my eyes away from his hair as we walked out again, him not replacing the hat on his head and just wore the sunglasses.

‚ÄúThank you, see you for the next one.‚Äù Willow offered as we started down the street toward the train station again.

‚ÄúWho was that back there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean Willow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, she seemed to know you.‚Äù I said replaying when she looked back at me when Edward was starting to panic.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a friend from a while back, maybe when I was twenty or so. We hung around the same group and stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe seemed to know you quiet well.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, yeah sort of, I think we‚Äôve had a few heart-to-heart conversations in the past, nothing really deep just sort of talking about emotions and stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seemes like she meant a lot to you, how come you never mentioned her before?‚Äù

‚ÄúI never really thought about it, we broke it off amicably when we realised we were too different.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your ex?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

I decided that maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have brought up the topic or pushed for more answers, it seemed like he was thinking a bit now about the past so I decided to ask another question instead.

‚ÄúWho was that other lady in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean her sister?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her sister? They look nothing a like.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was adopted when they were both younger, I didn‚Äôt much like her to be honest, there was always something she needed to complain about.‚Äù He said as we continued walking.

I kept looking up at the primate‚Äôs head and the urge to poke or pet the fur was almost insurmountable but my worry for his mental health won out. He noticed that I kept looking up at him and he asked.

‚ÄúDoes it look bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. not at all. I think it looks cu- dashing, it looks dashing.‚Äù I offered correcting myself before I messed up further. He sighed in return and looked around and then at me.

‚ÄúIs it really that bad?‚Äù He asked again.

‚ÄúNo, I mean it, it looks good on you.‚Äù I said quickly to reassure him having to restrain my arm from raising to the human‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúThen why are you staring at me like that?‚Äù He asked when I saw a group of three humans coming the other way. They were chatting amongst themselves when one of them saw me and said something to their friends before going quiet and just kept walking.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ you know how we are.‚Äù I explained turning my attention toward him.

‚ÄúAh, I see. I guess you aren‚Äôt over the ‚Äòcute thing‚Äô entirely yet.‚Äù

I was about to reply when I was walked into by one of the humans I saw earlier, they only hit their shoulder against me but when I turned to see if they were okay, I was roughly shoved backward, losing my footing and stumbling over my tail.

‚ÄúWatch where your going f\*ckhead.‚Äù The human wearing a blue sweater shouted at me.

‚ÄúYou had plenty of space to walk around.‚Äù Edward said to the man helping me up.

The other two, one was taller than the rest but looked skinny, while the other was a bit stockier and wore a red checkered shirt. They started to walk back at us after Edward said that. I felt my heart rate spiking after thinking about some of the stuff the human‚Äôs had been saying online recently.

‚ÄúYeah, well maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be walking here at all. Why‚Äôd you bring it here in the first place?‚Äù The first man offered back glaring at Edward as he turned to face him.

‚Äú*He‚Äôs* my friend and if that pisses you off, good.‚Äù Edward offered back lowly.

I couldn‚Äôt do anything; I was frozen on the spot my heart racing at the thought that this may turn violent. I don‚Äôt want to hurt the primates, and I don‚Äôt want Edward to get hurt either, not on my account.

‚ÄúI-It was my-my fault, I‚Äôm s-sorry.‚Äù I squeaked out through my nerves, the trio turned to me all glaring and I felt myself shrink underneath the weight of it.

‚ÄúOh, did the slave driver say something?‚Äù Another one of the men said toward me.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt talk to him like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you gonna do about it, push over?‚Äù The first one who pumped into me got closer to Edward trying to scare him. I don‚Äôt know how he wasn‚Äôt scared of these three threatening him but was scared of us. I was terrified if either did this to me.

‚ÄúWait a minute, I know you.‚Äù The man wearing the red and white checkered shirt said to Edward. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from that sh\*tty therapy group, you may have gotten a new hair style, but I‚Äôd recognise that cr\*ppy accent anywhere.‚Äù Out of the corner of my eye I saw Edward‚Äôs hand clench tightly has he took a deep breath closing his eyes, before releasing it and unclenched his fist.

The man that spoke made his way closer getting in Edward‚Äôs face as he opened his eyes to stare at the man.

‚ÄúYeah, I am. I remember you from that meeting, I need to say sorry for my conduct.‚Äù

‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô

I was lost, why was Edward being like this? These people were just threatening us and he‚Äôs apologising about something else. I guessed it was about the therapy incident and maybe he was doing this to calm the situation between all of us?

‚ÄúYeah, well I‚Äôm not.‚Äù Is all the man replied with before striking Edward across the face with his fist making Edward stagger backwards almost falling down. I was frozen as the man in the blue jumper shoved me again and I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

‚ÄòWhat do I do? Do I defend myself and curl up? What about Edward then he‚Äôll be alone against these thugs?‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt know, all the decisions I could make made me freeze as the man punched me in the gut making me gasp for air falling to the ground on my side. I was about to start curling up to protect myself, coughing and spluttering trying to get oxygen back into my lungs when I saw Edward dash over and smack the man in the stomach himself.

He had red leaking from his lips and an angry look on his face I had never seen before, the blow didn‚Äôt seem to be as effective as the one he hit me with as the man hadn‚Äôt fallen only stumbling a little before regaining his balance cradling his stomach.

I watched in horror as the stocky human rushed over after having thought he did enough to Edward and threw another punch at him, it missing and only striking him in the upper arm.

I needed to get up and help, I can‚Äôt just let my friend get beaten up by these people, I can‚Äôt let him get hurt again. I dragged as much air into my lungs as possible, yet it felt like I was breathing through a straw and was starting to feel dizzy.

The tall man had moved around to the side of Edward where I was laying and I could see that he was getting ready to intervene and grab Edward, who was busy throwing a blow at the stocky human, it hitting him in the side making the man stumble trying to regain his balance grunting as he did so.

I kicked as hard as I could against the tall human‚Äôs leg, I felt something give out as he screamed falling to the ground next to me, my dizziness only compounding further after the effort.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get it now.‚Äù I heard one of the men saying but couldn‚Äôt tell which one, I only saw a blue jumper approaching Edward something in his hand. I tried to scream at them, for Edward to look out but was only able to produce a chocking rasping noise.

I saw Edward getting hit again by the man in the red shirt, this time hitting him in the side much like the blow earlier and the man wearing blue approaching from behind. My field of vision growing fuzzy around the edges as a shape from my right where the other human was lying moved across me and was readying a blow to strike at me.

I tried to curl into a ball, but my strength failed me, and I feverishly tried to raise my arms in time when the human was kicked off me from somewhere else. I looked up to see another figure a taller stocky human running toward the man wearing blue before they tackled him to the ground hard, a grunt being audible as both of them hit the ground.

‚ÄúUp you get.‚Äù The figure closest to me said trying to lift me up while I observed what was happening.

‚ÄúEdward.‚Äù I croaked out.

The two men were momentarily distracted by the intervention, Edward regaining his sense first, threw a wide punch striking the man against the side of the head making him stumble before following up and landed another hit in the man‚Äôs stomach making the stocky human fall to the ground clutching ta himself, making rasping noises.

The man wearing blue was being restrained on the ground by the lone human pinning him. I looked over to see the other human helping me balance, they looked like the big human who was pinning the guy in the blue jumper.

‚ÄúStuart, let off him.‚Äù The human next to me said.

Stuart as I had just learned got of the smaller man and they scurried back wards to get away and back on their feet and turned to face us. Edward had moved around and took the place the other man took helping me stay balanced as I tried to control my breathing.

My chest clenched as I noticed that he was bleeding from both his head and lips now, but he seemed to not care only staring at the man who was slowly getting on his feet again.

‚ÄúI would suggest you get your friend here to a hospital, seems like he broke his leg in a fall.‚Äù Stuart said threateningly. His voice extremely deep in pitch but carried in a way that was soothing to the ears.

‚ÄúY-you‚Äôll be hearing about this.‚Äù The man in the blue shirt said as his cohort helped the tall man hop on one leg. I could see that his nose was bleeding profusely while he had to hop on one leg.

‚ÄòI did too much damage, why did I do that?‚Äô

‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt, if you think about taking this to the Guards, we‚Äôll have evidence to back up our claim of self-defence.‚Äù The man who helped me pointed toward a security camera and then another across the street attached to a street light.

The three men didn‚Äôt reply only turning and hobbling away helping the human with the broken leg, I caused.

‚ÄúEdward, your gonna have to tell me what happened here?‚Äù The big human asked turning to face Edward after eyeing an implement on the ground, I couldn‚Äôt tell what it was, but I knew it must have been dangerous.

‚ÄúThose guys decided to start a fight.‚Äù He said back, raising a hand to dab at the cut on the side of his head, wincing a little as he did so. I could see the red staining his face, I didn‚Äôt like it at all, I wanted him to be safe.

‚ÄúReally, I know that was the guy you had a problem with at the therapy.‚Äù The human who helped me said. ‚ÄúWe know he threw a punch at you cause we in a caf√© across the street here, did you say anything to p\*ss him off?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I literally just apologised for the way I acted during it after his mate bumped into my friend. I apologised and he said that he didn‚Äôt forget about it before throwing a fist at me.‚Äù

The larger man stared for a moment his face straight and just as intimidating as the men from before had done, before to my astonishment he smiled the biggest grin I had ever seen on a human face before continuing.

‚ÄúSo, is this the housemate I keep hearing about?‚Äù He asked, completely different from before.

‚ÄúNah, this is Cruth, my partner from the exchange program. Cruth this is Stuart Leadles, he goes to the therapy I go to.‚Äù

Stuart offered an incredibly large sized hand toward me and I shook it still trying to get my breathing under control. His hand was almost the size of my claws, it was massive compared to any other humans I had seen.

‚ÄúH-hello.‚Äù I offered through my wheezing.

‚ÄúI see you got haircut, looks good despite the blood in it.‚Äù He said looking at Edward now. ‚ÄúOh, where are my manners, this fella is my younger brother Lewis.‚Äù He pointed a finger toward the other human, that must have been why they looked similar, the familial traits where definitely pronounced, he was tall just not as bulky.

‚ÄúSup.‚Äù He said nonchalantly. ‚ÄúYou gonna be okay man, that looks a little bad?‚Äù He pointed at Edwrad‚Äôs injuries.

‚ÄúAye, I‚Äôll be fine, I‚Äôve had worse before.‚Äù He said scratching the back of his head.

‚ÄúI suppose I won‚Äôt keep you any longer, those guys could probably be back at some point or maybe tell someone else to come here.‚Äù Lewis said.

‚ÄúWhat about you guys?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be finishing our coffee and besides I could probably snap one of them in half if I have to. That and we were simply ‚Äògood Samaritans‚Äô helping out some people who we saw get attack on the street.‚Äù Stuart said as if he had done this sort of thing before. ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôll see you at the next meeting, and you look a lot better.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you then. Let‚Äôs get going Cruth.‚Äù He said before we began to hobble back toward the train station. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that his demeanour had changed seeming almost lighter now than before. I glanced over at him, my arm draped over his shoulder and I saw the slightest of smirks on his face.

1nhxjgj,https://i.redd.it/nk09mwj54epf1.jpeg,"The Paradox Between Turbinate Volume and Complaint Severity in Patients with ""Empty Nose Syndrome - ENS""","In patients with turbinate hypertrophy, the turbinate tissue may be altered by heat damage during therapeutic radiofrequency, laser, and other procedures. Even if it doesn't significantly reduce in volume, it can become swollen, dry, and fibrotic. Adverse changes in the turbinate mucosa may also contribute to this condition. Following excessive radiofrequency or surgical interventions, the turbinate mucosa may lose its function. In this case, symptoms and complaints in patients with empty nose syndrome may vary depending on the health of the turbinate remnant. In the image above, ""Patient 1"" on the right underwent a near-total¬†**turbinate resection**¬†and has an ""*S-shaped nasal septum deviation*"". While the patient in image ""patient 2"" did not have many symptoms of ENS, following turbinate radiofrequency reduction performed 3 months ago, the patient in image 2 has numerous symptoms of ENS, including a feeling of dry and cold air in the nose and a feeling of air hunger. This could be due to increased nasal resistance due to the patient in image 1's deviated septum, slowing down the inflow of inhaled air into the nose, or the remaining turbinate remnants being healthier. Although the turbinate size in image 2 doesn't appear to have decreased significantly, the excessive radiofrequency energy applied to the remaining turbinates may have caused them to become cold, dry, and fibrotic, leading to a decrease in function. This patient was advised to regularly perform nasal irrigations with ocean water, drink plenty of water, avoid salty foods, avoid strong tea and coffee, follow a high-hydrate diet of vegetables and Mediterranean.

Before I started. I spent 3 weeks getting myself into a positive and productive headspace. Increased my steps to 15k, on a calories deficit and meal planned. Also increased gym sessions per week. I lost 3kg. 
First jab last Sunday. No side effects other than super strong food suppression. Barely ate for the entire week and wasn‚Äôt as active. By Friday I was flagging and ‚Äòforced‚Äô some food down me and was able to eat something Saturday and Sunday. I would say less than 500 cals Sunday to Thursday, max 1000 cals Friday to Sunday. Great news was I lost 4kg
I‚Äôm really determined to make this a life changing opportunity rather than something I can‚Äôt sustain. So jabbed yesterday and again today has been extremely food suppression however I‚Äôve again ‚Äòforced‚Äô myself to eat something - porridge, oat cakes, 3/4 of a protein heavy meal and a protein yogurt. I‚Äôve managed 100grams of protein (including a clear whey and coffee) and again max 1000 calories. I did manage a 5k run before tea so I did have a fair bit more energy. After tea and the yogurt I‚Äôm so so extremely full and bloated.

It‚Äôs that way whenever we talk also. Always in a rush. Like I get it but annoying. It‚Äôs like he is checking boxes all the time, but never going below the surface. We are supposed to go to dinner tonight. He asked me for ideas. I said for him to decide and let me know when and where to meet. He asked me immediately again for ideas. Like put some effort in dude. I had to plan it.

I just got into a text exchange with him when he asked how my day was going- he doesn‚Äôt ever really ask questions or respond to mine with any depth. I appreciate he isn‚Äôt getting all sexual yet but he doesn‚Äôt even flirt when I drop stuff. I am just like- why am I even going? Because I need to date and not have expectations like I am husband shopping because I am not. So right? Isn‚Äôt that dating? Go enjoy a meal and get to know someone. But why if they are already on my nerves? I don‚Äôt know how to do this at 44!!

There just isn‚Äôt depth there at the level I like to have. Just a mismatch. So the correct answering I shouldn‚Äôt go tonight, right? In fact I shouldn‚Äôt lead him on. Or maybe it will be better tonight? It‚Äôs just dinner, right? Is it rude to cancel when it‚Äôs in 3 hours? Over thinking at this point!

Cancel? Yes or no? Please mention your age and gender when you respond if you don‚Äôt mind- always helpful :-)

Update: He just called and said he got roped into something after his fundraiser. Wanted to push dinner to 8 or go for a walk instead.

We have been friends since over 15 years, and honestly she wasn‚Äôt always like this. Maybe she slowly turned into this stingy opportunistic asshole after marrying her shithead husband or after giving birth, I dont know. I just realize that I find myself always giving financially and she is not giving anything back. Basically she is using my low tolerance for conflict and confrontation, as well as my naivety and gullibility. Some small remarks is:

She got married and I went to her hometown for the wedding, even when I was unemployed at the time. She covered the hotel by inviting me to stay at her father in laws hotel along with all the other guests (so it wasnt just me), but still I went all the way and paid for gas.

She born a baby and i went to visit her with some gold and with baby clothes. (This is a tradition we do in our culture on someone‚Äôs big life milestones to buy small gold)

She bought a house and i went with teacups as housewarming gift. On many other occasions whenever I go to her place i take her sweets or coffee. Even the last time she invited me home she claimed she doesnt have coffee at home and said I could buy it nearby cafeshop. Out of curtesy, i asked would she and her hisband also want some coffee, she said yes please two lattes. Like, bitch you invited me to your home? And you have no coffee? Then the least thing you can do is not ask for two more coffees for you and your husband.

The last straw for me was that she bought a summer house and invited me there. Before going she texted me that she is preparing some chicken and I can bring something else. I said sure ill being appetizers. She said maybe you can bring some meat instead. I said ok. Then when we met, she asked what kind of meat do you prefer, entricote or sausages. I said I dont mind whatever. Then we went in the butcher to buy it. It cost a lot to buy meat in my country, especially entricote. She said half heartedly ‚Äúif you want let me pay for it‚Äù. As if she didnt specifically ask me to buy meat prior to this. But in actuality she waited for me to say no this is on me. I felt obligated to say that as I am terrible with saying no, I feel very bad when I refuse someone. So i went ahead and paid. But I feel taken advantage of. Because she keeps inviting me to her home and then asks me to sponsor the main ingredient (like meat for dinner, coffee for chat) as if she invites me over for food. This has been happening a couple of times.

On top of all of this, I also bought a house recently and have been paying for mortgage. and let alone gold, she didnt even give me a simple housewarming gift after all the shit I did for her.

I dont want to confront her because she had a similar problem with another friend and this friend confronted her and they broke their friendship. But ever since then she keeps smearing her that this friend was keeping scores and she was double faced. 

How do you break a friendship like this with zero drama? At this point after the entricote incident, I dont value our friendship and I think she doesnt respect me and she is only using me to. It is just sad that she had been in my life for a long time and we had many memories (even though we are not best friends at all).

Please tell me if I am exaggerating or am I right to want to cut her off? And how to move forward ",2,1757968303.0,autism,3,1.0,False

1nhx7t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nhx7t2/does_waterdrop_wdpfal_replacement_alkaline_filter/,Does Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filter Improve Coffee Taste Effectively Review,"The Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filter has become a trusted companion in my daily routine. As someone who values clean, refreshing water, I decided to give this filter a try after hearing so much about its benefits. From the improved taste of my coffee in the mornings to its purported health perks, this little device has found its way into many aspects of my household. While the product impressed me in several areas, there are a few points worth noting that might affect its appeal for certain users. Here's my detailed review based on my hands-on experience.

**Design and Fit**

The compact design of this filter is immediately noticeable. With dimensions of 3.11""D x 8.07""W x 5.47""H, it fits snugly in all compatible Waterdrop pitcher systems. Having tested it with my WD-PT-07W pitcher, the filter slid in seamlessly, and the snug fit gave me confidence in its compatibility claims. It's quite lightweight at 1.3 pounds, making installation straightforward, though the plastic casing does feel a little more fragile than expected for something designed to handle water filtration. That said, the sleek design doesn‚Äôt take away from its functionality. I‚Äôve been able to remove and replace it quickly during monthly maintenance routines.

**Healthy Alkaline Water**

Being part of one of the newer health trends, alkaline water intrigued me. This filter claims to enrich water with minerals like calcium, magnesium, selenium, and zinc, simultaneously boosting the pH to a range between 8.0 and 9.5. I never believed water could taste ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù until I tried this filter. The slightly alkaline taste genuinely stands out‚Äîit‚Äôs milder and more refreshing. Admittedly, I don‚Äôt feel younger or fancier drinking it, though the added minerals seem like a solid bonus, especially when hydration becomes a key part of my day. My niece jokingly calls it my ""fountain of youth water,"" so maybe there‚Äôs something to it after all. 

**Improved Coffee Taste**

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. As a coffee enthusiast brewing at least two cups daily, I noticed an immediate difference when using water filtered with this replacement. It reduced the bitterness in my darker roasts, allowing the flavors to shine. My morning brew tasted more balanced and subtly sweeter, which hints at the filter‚Äôs ability to refine water acidity. Friends who tried my coffee even commented on the flavor being smoother. This feature alone feels worth its weight, especially if you‚Äôre a daily coffee drinker like me.

**Filtration Performance**

Here‚Äôs where the science gears up. With 6-stage filtration technology, this product promises to eliminate a slew of water impurities. Over a few days, I tested the filtered water using both tap water and well water. The removal of unpleasant odors, chlorine, and even fluoride seemed efficient. They‚Äôve even had this tested by a third party, which builds some trust in its claims. What blew me away was reading up on its absorption capacity‚Äîthe advanced carbon fiber tech apparently performs 10x better than standard filters, and honestly, that checks out. My family could discern a clear taste difference compared to our previous filter. 

**Favorable Aspects**

- Fast installation that adapts to multiple pitcher systems.
- Effectively balances water pH and enriches it with essential minerals.
- Highly efficient at removing impurities, odors, heavy metals, and more.
- Significant improvement in the taste of coffee and other drinks.
- Lasts up to 100 gallons, offering decent longevity for a household of four.

**Caveats**

- Not all types of water sources will see dramatic improvements. Noticed less of an effect on bottled water compared to direct tap.
- Plastic casing feels slightly flimsy during installation.
- Requires compatible Waterdrop pitchers; not for universal use across filtration systems.

**Comparable Products in the Market**

While this filter has a lot going for it, the competition isn‚Äôt far behind. Other major brands like Brita and PUR offer similar pitcher filtration systems. In side-by-side tests, the Waterdrop filter had a faster flow rate (0.3 gpm) compared to Brita‚Äôs slower processing speeds but didn‚Äôt use as environmentally durable materials. On the other hand, PUR‚Äôs filters are often bulkier, which gives the Waterdrop an edge in design. However, Brita offers a wider range of universal filters for those not tied to a specific pitcher model. 

Waterdrop stands out specifically for its ability to boost the alkalinity of water while maintaining an impressive mineral profile. If those are features you prioritize, it‚Äôs a tough contender to beat despite its few physical drawbacks.

**Bang for the Buck**

When it comes to value, I‚Äôd say this product offers decent bang for your bucks. The features stack up well against its market rivals‚Äîfor standard tap water users, the enhanced taste and improved pH levels genuinely add to the experience of day-to-day hydration. However, I‚Äôve found that the 100 gallons lifespan might run quickly in larger households, so keep that in mind if you have a high daily water consumption rate. Pricing fluctuates moderately, but in terms of feature-to-price ratio, it lands in the ‚Äúsmart spending‚Äù category for me.

1nhx2ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1nhx2ul/would_you_continue/,Would you continue?,"All of a sudden I am a rich man., I‚Äôm not a bazillionaire but I won‚Äôt have to ever work again. My big problem now is what do I do with all the time that I spent working and stressing about work? After celebrating last night with Mike, my partner ‚Äì er as of today my ex-partner, I woke up feeling better than I thought I would as I‚Äôm not one who usually overindulges in food and drink. With nothing on my schedule and my phone not ringing with people needing something that required my immediate attention, I decided to do something I‚Äôve seen people do in movies. I walked to the corner coffee shop and had a coffee.¬†

It‚Äôs a typical winter day here in Pennsylvania. Two days ago it snowed about four or five inches overnight and in the morning the new snow covered the griminess. It was calm, quiet, and beautiful, and then the people started to come out and ruined it. The snowplow fairies magically cleared the parking lots and piled the snow around the light poles. Those piles will get uglier day by day and survive until May. Yesterday it warmed up, if you call 40 degrees warm, and the sun came out all day, all 5 hours of it. Today the temperature is back to a normal 30 degrees with a wind chill of unbearable. Some of the snow melted yesterday. There are still plenty of those gray, almost black lumps of a mix of snow, road salt, cinders, and whatever else sticks to the wheel wells of vehicles and then randomly drop around town looking like dinosaur turds littering the city. I gotta get out of here.¬†¬†

Mike moved to one of those Midwest states to help his daughter. I don‚Äôt have any children as my late wife had some ongoing health issues and it just didn‚Äôt work out for us. After she died I threw myself into our business. It was a way of not dealing with my feelings and our new business was on the brink of bankruptcy. Mike and I worked our asses off during that time and got things on track thanks to a big contract from our old employer. From then on it wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing but we managed to keep our head above water and in a few years we started to make a profit.¬† Then we hired a couple of people to take over some of the routine jobs that sucked so much time out of our frenzied days. That helped a lot but brought personnel issues that only either Mike or I could deal with.¬†

The stress level was so intense when we first started that when we were close to finishing one contract we would panic and worry about how we were going to make it if we didn‚Äôt get another one soon. That was one of the reasons that we seldom turned down bidding on a job even when we already had our hands full with current jobs. No job was too big or the deadline too short. If we won a contract we worked our asses off to meet all the conditions and complete it on time or before it was due, and we usually did. Mike and I made all of the big business decisions together. Some were good, some were bad. Some lost money, most made money.¬† Occasionally we fell into a contract with a company that kept coming back year after year. That eased our minds somewhat.¬†

When word got out that we were considering an offer for our business our old employer brought up the possibility of us returning to his business as consultants. I told him that I was going to enjoy not working for a while and that I‚Äôd keep his offer in mind. Mike told him that he would be unavailable as his recently divorced daughter needed him to help with her three-year-old son and six-month-old daughter and he was moving out of the area to be with her.¬†

For 22 years we spent practically every day working. When we weren‚Äôt working we were worrying about work stuff. Being responsible for ‚Äúeverything‚Äù is not easy, even with as small an operation as we had. Neither one of us was a delegator. So ‚Äúburnt out‚Äù was the only way to describe the two of us when the unexpected offer came.¬†

When I did manage to get a day or two off, if I wasn‚Äôt stressing about something at work I was dreaming of being retired. It took Mike and me a couple of weeks to make the decision but we got together one evening in Mike‚Äôs office and discussed it over a couple of beers. We couldn‚Äôt come up with any reasons not to sell but we came up with several good reasons to just do it. The price offered was much much more than we ever imagined but since this was the first time we both sat down and thought about it and started to add up all that we had invested we realized that, yes we were worth it. It was a stress-free way to end this and we would be free.¬†¬†

Mike was the ideal guy for me to be partners with. I would never have been able to last through all that we had been through the last 22 years with anyone else. We just got each other. We hardly ever had arguments about anything business related but we never had anything outside of business to discuss so that limited the arguments.¬†

Mike and I never got to be besties. You would think that after working together and owning a successful business, two guys would be close but when I was free Mike was responsible for everything just like I was responsible when he wasn‚Äôt there. When we did have a long conversation it was about work. We didn‚Äôt even discuss sports as he was a die-hard Penguins fan and I was Steelers all the way. I knew the janitor almost as well as I knew Mike.¬†¬†

Imagine this. You wake up one morning and decide to take your shot at a new career. But before you even begin, you don‚Äôt write your own resume you feed your life into an AI, and it spits back a polished version of you. It‚Äôs not you exactly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a slightly shinier, slightly exaggerated projection. Already, your identity has been abstracted into data wrapped in flattery.
You send that data packet out into the world.
On the other side, no human being touches it. It doesn‚Äôt land on someone‚Äôs desk with a coffee stain, it doesn‚Äôt get read aloud by a recruiter who smiles when they see your story. Instead, it gets scanned by another algorithm, stripped for keywords, scored, sorted, and filed away.
AI talking to AI. Machine to machine.
And then, you a real person with blood in your veins and 37 years of trauma, skills, and survival under your belt receive a reply. But it‚Äôs not from another person. It‚Äôs from a script. A ‚Äúthank you for applying‚Äù that could have gone out to anyone, anywhere, for any job. The illusion of a human interaction, but really just another program running the same old line of code.
At this point, the entire exchange has been simulated. You wrote your application with AI. They processed it with AI. The ‚Äúconversation‚Äù was just two algorithms talking while you sat there waiting for permission to exist in the system.
So what do you do? You glitch it. You watermark your resume. You insert humor. You drop in raw truth ‚Äúpsychological trauma survivor with 37 years‚Äô experience.‚Äù Suddenly, you‚Äôre not playing along. You‚Äôre breaking character in the simulation, proving that you see the code.

That‚Äôs the tie-in.

The job market isn‚Äôt just frustrating it‚Äôs a living demonstration of the simulation hypothesis. A loop of artificial interactions, where the human gets reduced to data, and the data gets traded between machines until eventually a system spits out a decision.

As someone who has always appreciated a well-made brew, I found it hard to resist the charm of this Caribbean-colored, premium stoneware gem. My expectations were already high, seeing its reputation, and after weeks of use, I can say it lived up to the hype. But of course, it's not without some quirky points worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This French press doesn‚Äôt just make coffee‚Äîit decorates the kitchen. The vibrant Caribbean glaze instantly catches the eye, and the premium stoneware construction feels solid and durable. On my counter, it stands out like an artistic centerpiece. I've dropped it lightly against my granite countertop a couple of times (accidentally, of course), and there isn‚Äôt a scratch or chip to be seen. The material is not only tough but also resistant to stains, making maintenance a breeze. For someone as clumsy as me, it‚Äôs a huge relief knowing it won't crumble at the first hint of carelessness.

[Check Le Creuset 70706200170171 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b00p4qse1w/)

**Ease of Use**  
Coffee-making with this French press is as simple as it gets. It‚Äôs entirely manual, which means no fiddling with electrical parts or complicated mechanisms. I just toss in my coarsely ground coffee, pour hot water, let it steep, and press. The mesh filter system works beautifully, catching coffee grounds and leaving a smooth brew every time. It's a straightforward process, even for newbies to the French press scene. My niece, who doesn‚Äôt drink coffee but loves experimenting in the kitchen, managed to whip up a flawless cup on her first attempt.

**Performance and Results**  
The quality of coffee this press produces is spectacular. The heat retention of the stoneware surprised me the most. Even when I got distracted by a mid-coffee email (happens more than I‚Äôm proud of), the coffee stayed warm for an impressively long time. The flavor extraction is spot-on too. There‚Äôs something about the rich, full-bodied taste of French press coffee that a regular coffee maker just can‚Äôt replicate. I‚Äôve also used it with loose tea leaves for my partner, who swears the taste is leagues better than using traditional tea bags.

**Good Aspects**  
- Excellent heat retention keeps coffee warm, even if I get sidetracked.  
- Vibrant, durable finish adds a stylish touch to the kitchen.  
- Non-stick glaze makes cleaning almost enjoyable.  
- Performs equally well with both coffee and loose tea.  

**Pitfalls**  
- I found the handle to be slightly uncomfortable during longer pours, particularly when it's filled to the brim.  
- It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side. While this adds to its durability, some might find it less convenient to handle compared to lighter options.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to glass-based French presses like the Bodum Chambord, this stoneware beauty takes the win for durability and heat retention. Glass options, while lighter, feel more fragile under daily use (especially for someone as accident-prone as I am). On the flip side, stainless steel options, like those from Espro, have their own merits‚Äîprimarily their lightweight construction and advanced filtration. However, they lack the aesthetic appeal and charm that the Le Creuset French press brings to the table. Your preference would depend on whether practicality or design matters most.

**Affordable Quality**  
While premium kitchen tools like this French press often come with higher price tags, I can vouch that every penny spent feels justified. From its confidence-inspiring build to the exceptional coffee quality it delivers, it doesn‚Äôt disappoint. I‚Äôve owned cheaper French presses in the past, and while functional, they never managed to combine style and performance this seamlessly.

1nhwqa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/1nhwqa9/another_successful_hard_reset_story_hinge_ban/,Another Successful Hard Reset Story (Hinge Ban),"Hello all, 

A lot of this is nothing new, but I found that I really enjoy and appreciate reading successful hard reset stories.  So I think it's instructive to post another one so I can pass along what I did.

Like many of you, I had no idea what happened.  I was going out with this girl I met off Hinge back in Sept. of 2024.  Things were going well, so I didn't get back on Hinge for like 16-17 days.  A couple red flags emerged with this girl so I decided to at least open Hinge again, to explore more options.  Well, I was logged out.  That never happens.  When I went to log back in, it said my profile had been removed.  Same story:  email appeal, response denying it, and boom.  Banned.  I never did a BBB appeal or email the CEO thing...

Fairly sure it wasn't the ""red flag"" girl I mentioned above.  We had a slight falling out, but that was AFTER I got banned.  So likely wasn't her.  No f\*\*\*ing idea who could have reported me or what happened.  Years of using dating apps with zero problems, then got fucked...  


So here was my process, much if it you know already:

**1. Bought a cheap Samsung Galaxy A50**

**2.  Bought a new cell service plan through Tracfone**

 (and of course got a brand new number when I activated the service)

**2.  Created a Google account with a new gmail address**

**3. Took a bunch of new pictures of myself**

**4.  Ran ALL pics through the tool on this site:**  

[**https://internationalpill.com/online-dating-unban-and-reset/**](https://internationalpill.com/online-dating-unban-and-reset/)

So what I noticed with this tool is that it will create kind of a very slight yellowish/brownish tinge area, often on your face.  I've found that taking like 10, 20, 30 pics of yourself in the same pose worked alright.  So for example, I set my camera on a timer and sat on this bench and posed for a pic.  I kept doing that like 20 or so times.  So I basically had 20 of the same pic of me on that bench.  Then I ran them through the tool at the website above and a few of them looked better than the others (i.e. the dingy brown/yellow areas weren't right over my face).  

**5. Used a new payment method (you can use** [**privacy.com**](http://privacy.com) **or create a virtual card through an app called ""Mysudo"").**  I was having some issues with privacy.com.  I'm currently going back and forth with customer support.  Mysudo is a good alternative if you use a debit card, but you have to pay a small fee per transaction if you use a credit card. 

The Mysudo service itself costs money though.  Not ideal, but better than using a card in your name!  So, I set up a Mysudo card through the Google Play Store and I'm paying with that.  As soon as I get the privacy. com situation figured out, I will switch back to that.

6.  I went to a coffee shop about 25 miles away and used their WIFI.  I downloaded Hinge and went through the steps:  I used my new Tracfone number,  I slightly changed my name, date of birth, college.  I also wrote brand new prompt responses.  

7.  I uploaded 6 of my best pics that I processed through [**https://internationalpill.com/online-dating-unban-and-reset/**](https://internationalpill.com/online-dating-unban-and-reset/)

8.  I bought a Hinge Boost just to test the payment method and it it worked!

9.  I also blocked like 15 contacts on the Hinge app (using their phone number) just in case.  

I received a couple likes later that day.  I'm chatting with a girl right now!

My account has been up and running now for 3 days!

Overall, the process went smoothly.  We'll see how long it lasts (hell, I could get banned as I'm typing this!).  I wanted to wait like a month before I posted, just to make sure, but I figured why not. 

I'll post updates if something significant changes.
