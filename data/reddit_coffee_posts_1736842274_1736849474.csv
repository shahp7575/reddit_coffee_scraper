Then they start to elaborate on what the best next actions should be. The next actions are almost always subtle backpaddling or 180degree in the opposite direction from the initial advice.


My opinion on what they might be thinking:
- Did he really listened to me? So I am important enough for my opinion to be considered. Nice
- Is he really that stupid/blind to what my intention was with that comment I gave.

     
Real example:
me: I want to buy a coffee machine for the here, I think this one.
     

them: Gives advice on the most weirdest coffee machine on the market, how this one has all these options and is blablabla.
    

After I buy it, partially(50/50) with their money. Now their advice is, maybe you can still return it and get your money back for this other one.

Over the Christmas period I have started drinking pour over coffee which I am loving. I can't believe I have drunk instant for so long. 

I enjoy cooking / making things from scratch at home where I can so of course roasting beans has s
Peaked my interest. 

I also like the idea of being able to save a little money by roasting beans instead of having to pay so much for decent coffee ( I understand if I roast my own it's not going to be in the same league as a proper roaster ) 

My question is to start is using a pan a viable option? Or is this something that is going to be a big mistake. I was hoping to start by using a pan / wok and just go from there. If I enjoy doing it then to start looking at different ways of doing it and investing in it. 

Any suggestions are gratefully received. I am in the UK if that makes an different to your suggestions.

So, in my country it's common to have a small social gathering after the funeral service, in honour of the deceased. My grandmother died recently and was buried last Thursday.

We held the social gathering in a building adjacent to the church, belonging to the church and used for all church-functions that don't have to be in the actual church. Every Thursday, there's a conversation group for pensionists in the area, at 4 pm., so we knew we had to be out by 3.30 pm. The funeral service in the church was at 10 am., so we had been in the building since  noon. The building layout is, when you enter the main entrance you enter a hallway with bathrooms on the left, kitchen on the right and straight ahead is one big room, where the gathering was held. So when you exit the room, the kitchen is on your left, this is relevant.

At 2.45 pm., a little old lady shows up and tries to waltz right in as if she belongs there. I'm sitting near the entrance, luckily, and make eye contact with her before she's fully inside. She goes a bit red and this conversation follows:

Entitled lady: ""Oh is this the conversation group? I know I'm early""

Me: ""No, this is not the conversation group, it doesn't start until 4 pm.""

Entitled lady: ""Oh, whell what is this then? I'm already here, might aswell stay""

Me, looking around at mourners all dressed in black, having quiet conversations or crying quietly together: ""No, this is a funeral, we'll be out in 45 minutes, you can come back then""

Entitled lady: ""Oh okay, I'll just be on my way then""

And then she exits the functioning room to the hallway, then waits a little and then turn left and proceeds towards the kitchen, trying to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee on the way out.

Me: ""No, you can't have that, I'm shure they will serve something at the conversation group but this is hours""

Entitled lady, startled that I followed her: ""Oh that was quite the fright you gave me there, you can't just sneak up on people like that""

Me: ""Well, you can't just be seeking around at funerals where you don't belong""

Entitled lady: ""I wasn't, I just think it's fair to give me something to eat if you make me wait outside for 45 minutes""

Me: ""Lady, I can't deal with this right now. There's a cafe down the road, you can go there and wait, we are not making you do anything. You yourself said you knew you were early, you can't just help yourself at someone's funeral""

The lady scoffs and then walk out. I told my dad and we kept an eye on the entrance, she tried coming back 2 times before making eyecontact with me and quickly walking away.

We spoke to the priest and apparently, this is a recurring issue with her - usually the priest opens the doors for conversation group at 3.45 pm and she KNOWS this, but she lives near the church and if she sees somrthing going on, including funerals, she goes for the food and drink, playing the confused old lady if she gets caught.

I've seen a lot of posts lately with questions regarding peoples experience on Wellbutrin, so I thought I'd share mine since I'm now 6 months in. 
This is also intended as an ""expectation helper"" for those that are just starting out, and what I have done to add to the actual medication. 

Background; I'm 40 years old, nordic white male, around 85kg, semi-athletic. Married, 2 young kids. Always had ADHD symptoms but never really diagnosed. I drink regularly in moderation, though I love partying and have been known to down more than a small amount of alcohol during a night. I work as a DJ so my sleep schedule has been sporadic. 

In 2020 I experienced a burnout, but kept working, and my second child was born in late 2020. Then in a scope of 5 months in 2021, I had 4 very deeply traumatic events happen to me, and after struggling with the aftermath for 2 years I was diagnosed with PTSD.

I was on the verge of being suicidal, feelings of worthlessness, had anger issues, couldn't sleep more than 4-5 hours a night despite having been exhausted for 2 years, no energy, severe panic attacks 3-5 times per week. 

I was offered Esopram and Sertral by my psychiatrist, but I had heard that they can make you ""emotionally flat"", and though I don't like the lows in my mood, I do enjoy the heights. 
As severe anxiety is my main problem my psychiatrist suggested Wellbutrin as an alternative. A friend had told me he had been on Wellbutrin for years for his ADHD, and loved it, so I decided to give it a go. I started on 150mg. 

My plan was (and is) to use Wellbutrin as a crutch to get my head in order, and hopefully be off the drug in 12 months.
I've also been seeing a psychiatrist throughout the first 5 months, and took 6 session of EMDR. 

First 6 weeks
During the first 2 weeks I felt a huge surge of energy and even a touch of euphoria. My anxiety didn't go away but rather changed into a lower level, but felt more constant. 
My focus and will to just get things done grew exponentially.
At week 4 I was upped into 300mg.

Week 4 I started getting rage issues. The smallest things would irritate me to death, at one point my kids accidentally broke a cereal bowl and I just felt my whole body consumed with rage. It was so strong it actually hurt in a sprain I had in my shoulder. 
The anxiety is still there, in the same ""lower level but more constant""-mode.

At week 6 these issues the rage issues had subsided, though I still had (and have) a shorter fuse than I had before. 

Sleep has been an issue, I've had a harder time falling asleep, and also felt a stronger tendency to doomscroll my phone into the night. 

Now 6 months I feel a lot more balanced, and actually feel like I can do things. There have been ups and downs during this time which I feel like I can pinpoint to a few things.

Of course this is just my personal experience, but maybe it can help someone else; 
Too much much stimuli still sends my anxiety flying, but it's more manageable. I tribute this both to the psychiatrist and the drug. 

My energy level has been consistent, and feels even higher now than when I started. 
My depression feels like it's still there, but I don't spiral into feelings of worthlessness, and I don't beat myself up about the small stuff. 

My baseline happiness feels like it's up significantly, and I feel that's 75% thanks to the Wellbutrin. My overall baseline happiness contributes to my overall wellbeing, and to those around me, so everything feeds back into itself.  

What I have noticed helps me feel better on this drug; 

Caffeine. I've had to cut down my caffeine intake drastically, which makes me sad because I love coffee and preworkouts for the gym. I now drink 2 cups of coffee at the most, if I go over my anxiety goes flying and I get heart palpitations. 

Water. I need to drink lots and lots of water on Wellbutrin. 

Sleep. If my sleep falls lower than 6-7 hrs I'm a mess. To help me sleep I've been taking Melatonin about an hour before bedtime. 

Exercise. I go to the gym 3x a week, and play basketball 1-3x per week. 

Writing down and sticking to my routine, and make a checklist on what I need to do; What I need to do this week, in the next 3 months, and in the next year. Helps the anxiety.

Vitamin D and L-theanine. I take the Adam multivitamin from Now, which contains an ample amount of vitamin D and L-theanine, and I supplement the L-theanine with one extra capsule of L-theanine, also from Now. 
I feel that when I don't take L-theanine my anxiety levels go up. 

Food. As most people notice Wellbutrin tends to lessen appetite, so you have to remember to eat. 

I know this all sounds like what you should always be doing anyway to keep your mental health in check, but Wellbutrin gave me the energy to actually stick to it. 

Regarding drinking;
If I drink heavily I get heart palpitations. Like my heart is beating much harder than it does normally. I also feel like the actual effect of the alcohol is a lot less than before, and I get a lot less hungover. The palpitations subside in about 48 hours. 

I haven't gained weight, basically stayed the same, but for some reason I feel like I have a harder time gaining muscle mass?

I still have all my hair. 

My main reason for posting this is just to iterate that for Wellbutrin (like any other drug) should be used as a springboard to help you on your journey to better mental health. 
The drug on it's own has a limited effect, to get the most out of it you should try and use the energy and baseline happiness it brings to push yourself up.

It’s become a quiet ritual — inspecting leaves, adjusting the light, defending my plants from anything that could hinder their growth. I never imagined I’d see this kind of success in just 12 days, especially since I’ve always considered myself someone with a “black thumb.”

But this small victory has taught me something important: the same principles you apply to success in life — consistency, care, patience, and adaptability — work here too. You can’t rush growth, but you can create the right conditions for it. And when you do, the results speak for themselves. 🌱✨

Swipe to see the transformation from day 5 to today, day 12 - just 7 days between. It’s a reminder that even small efforts, applied with care and intention, can lead to big, beautiful changes.

Verbatim:

Angkol: sorry sa abala nawalan kasi ako ng pera ito yung passport ko (pakita samin ng passport niya) pauwi na sana ako sa Laguna I only had like 50 pesos makikihingi sana ako ng kaunting tulong 

Me: what happened kuya?

Angkol: Galing kasi ako sa rally ng INC then pauwi nako nahulugan ako ng pera, Im a content creator search niyo name ko sa youtube Im legit.

So, since yung mga phone namin nakapatong lang sa table grinab ko then I search his name sa yt then siya na nag maniubra I let him touch my phone.
I saw his posts mostly about supporting du30 

Me: Ah du30 supporter po kayo 

Angkol: oo, (smiled like he was proud about it) galing ako sa maynila nag join ako sa rally 

Me: Ah okay, wala kasi akong cash on hand kuya eh 

Angkol: kahit magkano lang nawalan kasi ako ng pera, para lang makauwi ako 

Me: ah so monetize na account niyo (after seeing his thousands of subscribers)

Angkol: yes sumasahod na ako every month

Me: hindi po ba kayo makapag withdraw merong atm nearby 

Angkol: wala eto lang dala ko sabay turo sa passport at bag niya which we find odd and sketchy well una palang naman alam namang modus si kuya

I asked my friend if he has spare then he gave me his wallet, so inidication na meron and since nakaupo kami and yung si angkol nasa gilid ko he can see for sure yung laman ng wallet ng friend ko, so I collected all his coins then humirit siya

Angkol: need ko 80+ pa para makuwi 

He saw na smaller bill ng friend ko is tig 100 so sabi ko okay lang ba? Hati nalang tayo (tig 50 kami) and he nod so I gave him 100 still of being aware na nanggagagantso lang 

Then I asked him why he supports du30

Angkol: kasi grabe yung kurapsyon ngayon lantaran hindi katulad nung panahon ni pduts takot mga tao dahil sa kamay niya na bakal

Me: eh parehas lang naman po sila mga kurap wala silang pinagkaiba 

Then he kept defending du30's then may sinasabi pa siya na gusto niya akong umagree so I told him na were not having the same values whent it comes to politics (as me being kakampink) then he kept on interrupting me na. Then he shifts his questions about social media drama 

Angkol: what do you think about darryl yap and vic sotto? Im going to create a content about them kasi just wanna know ypur thoughts sa pagsampa ng reklamo ni vic

My friend was just observing us the whole time lang wala siyang imik so Im the one responding sa mga tanong niya

Me: I havent watched the entire teaser ng movie as Im not really interested, but Ive seen clips lang

Then chika chika siya keso ang sisihin yung writer ng movie kasi why they would drop a name pwede namang alyas nalang

Im balling my eyes out because of his reasoning (if you would watch some of his clips you'll understand me maybe lols) 

Me: I dont know the real drama between paloma and vic sotto so I dont think I can make a statement about it

Chika chika nanaman siya, funny thing was he said was this.

Angkol: sorry if you dont mind Im speaking in english I just came to state netong nakaraang araw lang Im from LA yung nasunugan (indicating the wildfire incidents)

so we just nod to him while having weird faces and not buying what he was saying, mas confused pa kami why he needs to say sorry for speaking in english little did he know na while were having our own conversation ng friend ko we're speaking in english as if its normal to us we find it weird and hindi convincing si angkol sa mga sinasabi niya 

Then he walked out the cafe after he get what he wants

We had a little conversation about what happened.

Me: weird non, kung nawalan ako ng pera mangangatog buong kalamnan ko bago ako humingi ng tulong sa stranger baka maging shaky pa kamay ko while doing that 

Friend: true, at saka sabi niya content creator siya so dapat may dala siyang camera or even phone kasi they always needs that 

Me: true, ang sabi niya lang nawalan siya ng pera di niya naman simabi pati phone

Friend: true, at tsaka kung totoong nawalan ka ang una mong gagawin manghiram ng phone to contact a person to send you money hindi yung manghihingi ka

It is now 3AM and I woke up to the worst possible pain ever. My stomach was tightening to the point where I felt like it was sucking the life out of me. I didn’t throw up or gag, but I had a bad feeling I was going to. I felt the pain travel down as if my stomach was quickly trying to make a stool so I ran to the toilet. I thought I was going to fall off the toilet and pass out from the pain. Once I had that stool, I felt somewhat better so I tried going back to bed and listen so like a frequency meditation. That did not work and woke up to more pain; I ran back to the toilet and instantly had another painful stool. 

It’s now 3:30 AM and I have no idea how to tolerate this pain. I tried using a little gentle heat to my stomach and that’s not helping. Now I’m scared that anything is going to upset my stomach.

1i12gpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1i12gpz/article_how_do_i_form_and_maintain_strong/,[Article] How do I Form and Maintain Strong Relationships,"Relationship skills really matter; given this, it’s hard to believe how little they are taught.

Most kids learn to relate to others through observation and practice. Sure, you were told to play nicely, share, and treat others well, but you get almost nothing else. Worse, this minimal advice doesn’t work that well when you are a child. You can avoid bullying while being nice, but it usually involves being atypically advanced socially.

Our point is that most people learn to relate to others alone. Despite this, most people turn out reasonably well. Still, almost everyone reaches adulthood with one or more glaring errors, and many of these are crippling. There is a good chance you have only one flaw from the list below, but it is worth reading through all the others to find and fix it.

The quickest way to fix these childhood weaknesses is to go through common mistakes and ask yourself if this flaw applies to you. It is very easy to assume none do. If you are overconfident or bad at accepting faults, ask someone honest to do this with you. It may be hard to hear, but fixing these issues is worth it.

**Mistake 1: Not asking enough questions.** Many people never ask any at all.

My partner and I live in two different countries for part of the year, which means we commonly meet friends or family after several months apart. Most of our friends are intelligent and sociable. Most of them have plenty of friends, yet many of the people we know will ask no questions about what we’ve done during this time apart.

Failing to ask questions can have a significant impact. It makes individuals seem disinterested and means conversations often revolve around them. While many have developed strengths to compensate, these strengths would be amplified — not diminished — if they also engaged by asking questions.

Also, you’d better be gorgeous if you want to date long-term without asking questions.

**Mistake 2: Breaking the core rules of relationships**.

While the first mistake is the most common, this one matters the most.

There are two contenders to be the most important rule:

The first is the universally known “**Treat others as you’d have them treat you.**”

While some dating guides may suggest otherwise, the idea that being kind is detrimental is incorrect. You want to attract a partner and friends who will treat you well — and believe us, they do, too.

Negative perceptions of nice behavior often stem from encountering those who are kind but flawed, which leads to the two being conflated. It’s not kindness itself that’s problematic, but traits like being dull, repetitive, lacking strong opinions, avoiding controversy, being obsequious, never disagreeing, or appearing needy by seeking excessive approval or attention.

Many grow up making jokes at the expense of others. Many men especially feel they have to do this and even that their friends like this. Banter is good, right? It can be, but only if you don’t screw it up. Many people’s banter is simply insulting, and as a result, most people would be much more popular if they were kinder to their friends. It only takes one lost friend to counterbalance any advantage banter has.

Commonly, people are cruel by accident. They simply don’t notice that something they say is mean, and needless to say, if you can fix this, you will be a lot more popular.

The second rule is **to make yourself and others feel as good as possible**. You must sacrifice for relationships, but they should rarely make you miserable. If you do many things you don’t want to do for someone, it is well worth checking that this is correct.

Both of these rules have some exceptions, but these exceptions are rare. Whenever you break one of them, it is worth seeing if you screwed up.

**Mistake 3: Lack of effort.** The most common way to lose a friend is not conflict but laziness. If you never contact someone or invite them to things, you rely on their effort. Often, this means you’ll slowly drift apart.

We suggest you prepare for frequently occurring conversations in advance. Preparing for a conversation may seem forced. Most people, though, are comfortable practicing what to say for a job interview, sales pitch, business presentation, or speech; if you observe people who are well prepared for these, you should notice that they seem less forced. The same is true of planned conversations.

When you prepare a conversation, your goal should never be to follow an exact script. More like an interview, you should have answers to common questions such as, “What do you do?” you should have questions to ask and know what purposes you are working toward. It’s also good to have a supply of high-quality stories and jokes, especially those that link well to common or important conversations or the questions you plan to use.

As you’d expect, it is best to prepare for frequently occurring conversations, such as introductions, or significant ones, such as dating, especially online dating, where similar scenarios recur constantly.

**Mistake 4: Poor listening**. Listening is not just an absence of speech; active listening is a skill everyone should learn. To be above average, you don’t need much; just prompt people to continue, focus on what they say, and ensure that you speak proportionally to the number of people in a conversation. Speaking way too much is one of the most common flaws.

**Mistake 5: Lack of humor.** It is common to hear that humor is the most desirable trait. I rate it lower, but whatever your view, humor matters. Still, countless people are never intentionally funny.

Those who are good at telling jokes don’t get away entirely. Humor is often initially learned as a defense mechanism or to cover up other social flaws. If you are great at making others laugh, it may be worth asking yourself if those other flaws are still present.

**Mistake 6: Never studying relationships**

Many people spend thousands of hours studying for their careers, but almost none study relationships. If you value something, study it.

Dale Carnegie’s *How to Win Friends and Influence People* is, in my view, the best personal development book of all time. Although the advice sometimes seems obvious, very few people follow all his suggestions.

**Mistake 7: Lack of Communication**

People do not read minds. Unless you have specifically told someone how you feel or how something affects them, it is best to assume they don’t know. Assuming that they do will lead to severe problems. Even people with the best empathy skills will sometimes make mistakes.

Many people avoid meaningful conversations and confrontations. Unless someone realizes when they do something that upsets you, they will likely keep doing it. In most cases, you will need to tell them. Failure to do this is one of the main ways long-term relationships end. If you let resentment build up to the point you explode at someone or feel you need to cut them out, that is on you (at least after reading this).

While you will often naturally align with your partner, there will be areas where you should correct your assumptions. Discussion can bring significant positive change and deepen your understanding of each other. Trying to avoid disagreement entirely is a big mistake!

While openly discussing minor issues may not always be necessary, it unlocks pathways for growth. Considerable differences eventually demand attention, often surfacing amidst heated arguments or when damage has already occurred.

**Other important relationship mistakes**

Some other common mistakes:

* Smelling bad or doing something glaring that causes people to avoid you.
* Being negative: negativity is often draining. There is a big difference between asking someone to change something and complaining.
* Lacking empathy. Do you do anything that would annoy you?
* Simply avoiding people by staying in all the time or declining invites.
* Forcing through topics that your audience has shown bore them.
* Assuming the worst of others.

Once done with the basics, the next step is to work on how interesting you are. No one will ever tell you to be more interesting, as it is insulting. Regardless, the world’s most interesting person worked hard on this skill to get there. Learning to be more interesting implies nothing about your starting point.

Learning to tell stories well is the best starting point. Some people can make a trip to the grocery store gripping, and others can make a trip around the world deathly dull. When telling stories conversationally, the core skills are learning which interesting details to impart and, ideally, sharing your emotional reactions. After all, relationships come down to how you make people feel!

**How to Form New Relationships**

Keeping existing friends is more valuable than finding new ones, but both genuinely matter. Making friends is much easier if you first fix the mistakes we’ve listed above.

If you socialize a lot outside work and are still struggling to make friends, the solution almost always involves returning to the basics we outlined earlier. In addition, consider what motivates you and how you appear to others. While obvious, asking people you connect with to do follow-up activities can matter. Sometimes, the missing step is not asking to meet again. If all this fails and you can afford a coach, consider it.

Life often rewards those who use the simplest effective method, and forging friendships is no exception — especially if you find social situations challenging. It’s easier to befriend people when you do something you would choose to do anyway and with people like yourself. It is difficult, for example, for an older person to form a friendship with someone much younger without a natural setting, such as working together.

If you travel alone, hostels are a great way to make friends. The website and app Meetup are also great. Additionally, Toastmasters International is great for building confidence and is another good way to meet others.

Making friends and finding a partner are similar; everything we’ve discussed still applies. The feared friend zone is overhyped. It typically happens when someone does not find you attractive, you never share your interest, or they are already interested in someone else. Worry only if this occurs repeatedly.

If you like someone, let them know! Few men get asked out, so it is especially effective to ask them. Many are also terrible at picking up on signals that may seem obvious. Being direct can be embarrassing, but it is often the best way.

Few people think well of learning how to date (from methods other than real-life experience). Ignore this view; studying dating is especially valuable.

Dating resources vary in quality; those extensively discussing manners, what to wear, and manipulative techniques should generally be skipped.

Online dating is well set up to teach you a range of skills. The early stages of online dating are very similar each time. You can quickly discover what potential partners dislike or find attractive by varying photos and conversation strategies. Lessons learned here can extend well beyond dating.

Free dating sites are generally cheaper and better, mainly because few people use paid ones. Initially, your goal should be to attract as many people as possible, as this allows you to practice. Eventually, you are better served by a profile that broadly attracts people you are interested even if it deters others.

Marketing and self-knowledge are the main areas of expertise needed to build a profile. As a result, marketing or sales resources can help as much as dating guides. For example, Seth Godin’s *Purple Cow* is especially relevant. The core idea is that a purple cow stands out. Many people get rapidly bored when dating online, and standing out in some way is critical. Note that if everyone copies an idea, it ceases to be remarkable.

When dating, aim to paint a picture of yourself in an attractive but honest light that, as mentioned, makes you stand out. Use professional or high-quality photos that have ideally been selected by a friend or family member of the same sex and sexual orientation as the person you want to attract. Your photos should ideally express aspects of your personality. People will assume you like what your pictures show. You can even show traits such as bravery, kindness, or humor with well-selected photos.

What you write matters despite the widespread belief that it doesn’t. Writing nothing, something with an error, something truly inane, or being negative all reduce the quantity and quality of prospects. You can also stand out positively through writing, but photos and being error-free matter more.

The next stage of online dating involves sending messages. People often stop talking or pause much longer after a response that didn’t hit the mark. While highly erratic, this feedback is some of the best you can get on your social skills without a coach.

If possible, transition swiftly to a call. Calls are low-risk, as the app should support them without giving away personal details. Don’t be afraid to end calls once you lose interest. Being fast rarely makes a rejection worse, but it does save both people time.

When aiming to meet romantic partners in real life, the essential beginner tip is to check for a wedding ring. Ideally, identify a meeting place where people you would like to meet are likely to frequent. We’d advise against going somewhere you don’t want to be to meet people. Almost anywhere can work: museums, bookstores, coffee shops, dance classes, bars, or nightclubs, for example, but if you hate it, it will typically show. You can be strategic if you live in the right place; a nearby bar just after the end of a musical is likely an excellent place to meet women, and the same is true after most sporting events for men.

People will increasingly try to set you up with dates as you become more successful. Also, travel is worth a mention. Being unusual is attractive, and people are often more open to strangers when traveling themselves. Travel usually comes with the complications of a long-distance relationship.

The resource that helped me the most was David DeAngelo’s *Interviews with Dating Gurus*. While his other material is less good, his interview series with several dating experts should, at the very least, identify another expert who offers valuable advice. Unlike most of our recommendations, this is not universally applicable as it is aimed at heterosexual men. It’s also the most expensive guide we recommend in this book. A more widely applicable and less costly guide is the excellent *How to Not Die Alone* by Logan Ury.

If you didn't feel like listening to me yapping, just watch a video called ""being productive is easy, actually"" by a channel called ""easy, actually""**

Hey all! I'm a sophomore Pharmacy student,  I had been struggling with motivation the second I started college, skipping lectures, procrastinating with my exams, the only reasons I passed my first year was because I showed up for my practical lectures and becsuse I got lucky with the MCQs during my finals lol! 

And somehow I found a method so efficient that it made me, for the first time in two years, sit mt ass down and study for 8 damn hours... and the surprising thing is, this method was so simple it made me feel dumb, it's not something you need a guru to tell you, it's something my mom told me a long time ago...

**The thing is**... motivation and work are a circle

 
(Work) 🔄 (Motivation)

We often don't work because we don't feel motivated, but here's the fun part, WE FEEL MORE MOTIVATED THE MORE WE WORK! 

When you finish some work (check something off of your to-do list) you feel happy and proud of yourself and you get motivated, then you do more work, then you feel even more motivated and so on! 

One tip I couldn't believe it would actually work, if you have a more detailed to do list, you check far more boxes in it and feel even more motivated! 

Example: I used to write

[v] Study Thermodynamics 

Now, for the same task, I write

[v] Sit down on the desk
[v] Load Xodo (the app I use to read online)
[v] study Thermodynamics 
[v] Take few notes
[v] See your old notebook
[v] Take a well-deserved break

Therefore I feel even more motivated to be more productive now that I see I had done so much work!

But of course, we are not robots, you and me will inevitably face few issues, but do not depair my mate! First, a good 5 minutes break after every 25 mintues

And a 15 minutes break after 2 hours really helps! Other than that...

You may feel confusion on what you need to do today, which will drag your motivation down

(Solution) the detailed to-do list I mentioned earlier

You may feel tired when working

(Solution) even though it's harder for some people than others, have a good night sleep 

You may feel distracted when working

(Solution) it's helpful to put your phone in another room, and if your work was on a phone, laptop, or ipad then you can turn the wifi off on that one and work just like my buddy advised me

You may feel boredom 

(Solution) background music really helps
Or if you change the place you study (e.g. go to a park, coffee shop, library, or at least another room in the house) really helps too

Or if you couldn't do any of that and you were stuck to a single place like myself, you can just search the word (Ambience) on youtube, it'll make you feel as if you were in the place of the video.

And if you ever feel anxiety: Just ask yourself 

(what am I worried about? Is it reasonable? Will it matter in the long run? What can I control)

And there you have it folks! Thanks for reading my post all the way to the end, I wholeheartedly hope this method works for you like it did for me, god bless you all and good luck achieving whatever you aspire to achieve!",2,1736847198.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

\- A rubber stopper helps enormously with heating and also saves water.   
Tip: Fill with water with the lever slightly raised so that the portafilter can also fill with hot water.  

\- Drill a few holes in the flask for faster heating of all components. 



**Gimmick:** 

\- I found out that an IMS E&B Lab shower screen for the Bialetti Moka Express 3 cups fits into the ROK. However, it requires new seals. I had 2 food-safe silicone seals made for this. The filter fits like a sandwich between the two seals. Dimensions of the round seal: 

*Outer diameter: 67 mm*  
*Inner diameter: 49 mm*  
*Thickness: 2 mm* 



Does this make the espresso taste better? I have no idea.   
Is it fun? Definitely.

Series: Book 1 of 3 in The Chronos Chronicles  
Author Shami Stovall  
Available as a physical book, on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited and Audible

It's always a bit unfair to go into a new series of an author with expectations based on previous series. But I did. I previously read ""The Frith Chronicles"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also read the ""Star Marque""-books, which is one of my favorite series despite the fact that I'm mad that there never has been a 3rd book to conclude the trilogy.   
Thus, based on that and after reading the blurb I went into ""Time-Marked Warlock"" expecting a serious and mature urban fantasy story with the potential to make my favorites.   
""Time-Marked Warlock"" disappointed my expectations - that's just not what it is in my opinion.   
To me it felt like one of those ""action movie star actor teams up with a child to solve mystery""-movies.

The story follows Adair Finch, a warlock with the limited ability to rewind time, as he solves a murder mystery. He is accompanied by Bree Blackstone, a twelve-year-old, whose mother is the murder victim. They confront evil-doers, save a dog, meet a dwarf and connect over coffee. 

At no point did I believe the stakes where high. I didn't feel for the characters, I wasn't hooked or invested. It all felt a bit... shallow. 

But I still finished reading the book. Because it reads fluently. Everything flows nicely,the scenes connect, the characters are consistent, the time-loops are well executed and don't become annyoing to read at all.    
Once I let go of my expectations it was an enjoyable story. Not what I expected, but ok on it's own. They solve their mystery, so no major cliffhangers that leave you wanting.   
I'll probably read book 2 at some point, but I'm not thirsting for it.

That said by casual I don't mean not as nice... I mean not super fancy. Should be a nice spot just not like super fancy.

Somewhere we could get some appetizer type food and some drinks but not a pub or regular old bar either. 

Outside the box ideas welcome.
Just not super fancy that's not a good vibe for this kind of date I feel

So back in November I decided to completely cut out sugar and ultra processed foods and my results were amazing so I wanted to share.

I have GERD and IBS. I decided I was gonna completely cut out sugar on the very first day of November. I would eat eggs and bacon for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch and either a large chicken breast or steak with a potato and a green vegetable. I ate this everyday for 3 weeks. Im actually a binge eater so I struggle with cravings and have an addiction to food. When I first started this diet and absolutely no sugar I had very bad acne and I had INTENSE sugar cravings. I stood by my diet though and by day 3 the food noise was going away. By week one my cravings for food went away. I also no longer experienced bloating along with acid reflux! I also was getting full a lot quicker. My bodies satiety signals were being normalized due to the fact the award system that sugar gave my brain was gone. I was shocked at how I wasn't hungry anymore and I had realized my acne was actually going away. The only issue which would turn out to be a big issue was I had a raging headache. I can't take NSAIDS due to my GERD so I was stuck with horrible head pain with no painkillers. While my body felt great it felt like my head was gonna explode. This head pain continued and was worsening. I even ending up calling into work twice because of it. So after 25 days of being on then diet I ended up drinking a dunkin coffee with sugar in it and shortly after my headache actually vanished. I was shocked

  
During the diet I lost 10 pounds and my GERD pretty much resolved but I had a horrible migraine for 2 weeks. Weirdly once I drank sugar my head pain I had for 2 weeks vanished within a half hour. At the time I didn't consider cutting out sugar was causing my constant 24/7 headache. Im still actually not completely sure why my head pain lasted for so long as I feel like by 3 weeks my body would be detoxed from cutting out sugar but I don't believe so. Apart of me regrets breaking my diet because it's been hard for me to cut it out again meaning I won't eat sugar for 2 days and end up eating icecream lol. But this is my experience and I wanted to share it, I never cut out sugar for so long and the results shocked me. I think some people would benefit from it and It would help their weightless/health journey! If anyone else has tried it id love to hear what happened to you.

TLDR; Sugar was causing inflammation in my body that i wasn’t even aware of until i quit. Several gut issues of mine resolved aswell as horrible food cravings and acne. Downside is I got a horrible migraine that lasted the majority of the diet. ",6,1736845945.0,loseit,9,0.8,False
1i1251b,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1i1251b/i_really_have_no_idea_when_i_sleep/,I really have no idea when I sleep,"I think I am ready to figure this out if at all possible. My basic situation regarding how a 24-hour period passes for me has everything to do with the fact that I am semi-retired and keeping busy with a couple hobbies and an internet business that doesn’t require my immediate attention. My wife is a nurse with odd hours and she switches from day to night to day to double shifts without any effort. With that I mean, she sleeps… a lot. And she still has time for me and home stuff. So her inner clock is fine. Mine is completely twisted though.

I was just making my first pot of coffee for “the day” when she asked me if I was going to sleep soon. I should mention we have blackout curtains to facilitate her changing schedule. I looked at my watch with my old eyes and realized it was almost midnight not noon.

I need help. I think I might sleep about 4-5 hours every 30-35 hours or so. That can’t be good. I hate electronic “nags” so I am apt to ignore a notification from my phone that isn’t about business. I know that’s bad but I am mildly autistic and it’s really hard for people, and now things, to tell me what to do or sometimes even get my attention if I am working on a problem. I know I do it but it’s… difficult.

I am not sure I have a real question but I guess I needed to type out my thoughts on this because it’s pretty new to me, maybe the last 2-3 years at the most.

While functional lighting is essential, incorporating statement lighting fixtures can instantly elevate your interiors, making them stylish and memorable. Whether you’re revamping your living room, creating a cozy bedroom retreat, or redefining your dining area, the right lighting fixture can be the game-changer your space needs. Here's how to transform your home with standout lighting solutions.

# 1. Hanging Ceiling Lights: A Versatile Touch of Elegance

[Hanging ceiling lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) are perfect for adding drama and sophistication to any room. These fixtures draw the eye upward, creating a focal point that ties your space together. From minimalist designs to intricate, ornate pieces, there’s a wide range to suit every style.

**Where to Use Hanging Ceiling Lights:**

* **Living Room:** Create a dramatic centerpiece by placing a cluster of hanging lights over the coffee table.
* **Dining Room:** Choose a statement chandelier or black pendant light to hover above the dining table for a refined look.
* **Kitchen:** Illuminate your island with multiple pendant lights for both style and practicality.

# 2. Black Pendant Light: Sleek and Contemporary

A [black pendant light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) is the epitome of modern elegance. Its sleek design and bold color make it a versatile choice that works well in minimalist and industrial-style interiors. Black pendant lights are especially effective in creating contrast, adding depth to lighter spaces.

**Design Ideas with Black Pendant Lights:**

* **Kitchen:** Pair black pendant lights with marble countertops for a sophisticated aesthetic.
* **Bedroom:** Install [bedroom pendant lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) on either side of the bed instead of traditional bedside lamps for a chic, uncluttered look.
* **Home Office:** Hang a black pendant light above your desk to create a stylish and focused workspace.

# 3. Bedroom Pendant Lights: Cozy and Functional

The bedroom is a space where comfort meets style, and bedroom pendant lights are an excellent way to achieve both. They not only save space on your bedside tables but also provide focused lighting for reading or ambient light for relaxation.

**Styling Tips:**

* Hang pendant lights slightly above your bedside tables to create a cozy yet functional setup.
* Choose designs with warm tones or dimmable options to enhance the relaxing ambiance of your bedroom.

# 4. Floor Lamps in Dubai: Stylish and Functional Versatility

When it comes to adding both light and style, [floor lamps in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/evie-floor-lamp-black) are an unbeatable option. These versatile fixtures can easily move to different areas of your home, making them perfect for spaces that need flexible lighting solutions.

**Where to Use Floor Lamps:**

* **Living Room:** Place a tall floor lamp next to a sofa or accent chair to create a comfortable reading nook.
* **Bedroom:** Opt for a minimalist floor lamp with a sleek design to complement your modern bedroom decor.
* **Home Office:** Use a task-oriented floor lamp to brighten up your workspace without harsh overhead lighting.

# 5. Create Drama with Layered Lighting

To truly transform your space, layering your lighting is key. Combine hanging ceiling lights, pendant lights, and floor lamps to create depth and interest. Each fixture should serve a purpose—whether it’s task lighting, ambient lighting, or accent lighting.

**Pro Tip:** Layering is particularly effective in open-plan spaces, as it helps define different zones while maintaining a cohesive look.

# 6. Focus on Statement Pieces

When selecting lighting fixtures, consider them as art pieces that contribute to your home’s personality. A sculptural black pendant light, an intricately designed chandelier, or a unique floor lamp can instantly become a conversation starter.

**Shop Local:** Dubai offers a wide array of stylish lighting options, from luxury designer pieces to affordable yet stunning alternatives. Whether you’re seeking floor lamps in Dubai or striking hanging lights, you’ll find plenty of inspiration to create your perfect space.

**Why Statement Lighting Matters**

Statement lighting fixtures do more than just brighten up your space—they add character, highlight architectural features, and tie together your overall design. Whether you prefer the modern simplicity of a black pendant light, the warmth of bedroom pendant lights, or the functional beauty of floor lamps in Dubai, the right lighting can truly transform your home.

1i11u1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoForexSyndicate/comments/1i11u1y/the_wild_world_of_forex_traders_from_roller/,The Wild World of Forex Traders: From Roller Coasters to TradingView,"Forex traders, those daring heroes of the financial world, are like the rollercoaster riders of the economy. One moment they're on top of the world, riding high on their winning streaks, and the next moment they're plummeting down, clutching their laptops like life vests as they brace for impact. A Forex trader's life is a constant battle between greed, fear, and the occasional desire to throw the computer out the window.

Imagine waking up at 3 AM to check the charts. Your eyes are bloodshot, your coffee cup is empty, and you have no idea why you're even awake. The currency pairs are dancing in front of your eyes like a nightclub full of eager dancers, but you can’t find the right rhythm. You think you see a trend, but it’s as elusive as your ex’s excuses for not texting back.

But don’t worry, every Forex trader has their rituals. Some traders meditate before diving into the market, praying for clarity and calmness. Others make complicated spreadsheets to analyze every single tick on the chart—because that’s what successful traders do, right? Who needs sleep when you can have more data?

There are traders who swear by indicators, those little colorful lines that magically predict the future, yet sometimes feel like the financial equivalent of reading tea leaves. And let’s not forget those who rely on gut feelings, as if their intuition is somehow connected to the great trading gods in the sky. Spoiler: it’s not.

For many, [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) has become their trusted companion. This platform allows traders to analyze the market with precision, giving them the tools they need to stay ahead of the game. From creating customized charts to using a variety of indicators, TradingView has transformed the way Forex traders track currency pairs and execute trades. The ability to access real-time data and make informed decisions without juggling multiple tabs makes the process feel a bit like being in control of your own trading spaceship.

Forex traders are a rare breed. They're a mix of mathematician, psychologist, and fortune teller all wrapped in a hoodie and sweatpants, staring at a screen at 2 AM. They might seem serious, but don’t be fooled—underneath all the technical jargon and chart patterns is a person who just wants to be able to afford a nice vacation without worrying about the exchange rate. After all, Forex trading is about more than just numbers; it’s about the thrill of the chase, the excitement of the risk, and the sweet taste of victory… or the bitter sting of defeat.

In the end, whether they’re winning big or losing hard, Forex traders know one thing for sure: it's not about how many times you fall; it's about how many times you’re willing to pick yourself up, reload your chart, and start all over again. Because, after all, the market never sleeps... and neither do they.

1i11qyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i11qyy/how_to_transform_your_living_room_with/,How to Transform Your Living Room with Budget-Friendly Furniture Updates,"Your living room is the heart of your home—a space to relax, entertain, and showcase your personal style. If you’re looking to refresh it without breaking the bank, updating your furniture is a cost-effective and impactful way to transform the space. Here’s how to give your living room a brand-new look with budget-friendly furniture updates, using stylish and practical pieces like [chairs for sale](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs), versatile [stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/stools), and timeless options like [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan).

# 1. Start with Statement Seating

A new chair can instantly elevate your living room’s aesthetic. Look for chairs for sale that match your desired vibe, whether it’s modern, bohemian, or classic. Accent chairs with bold patterns or textured upholstery can serve as a focal point, while neutral-toned chairs can seamlessly blend into any decor.

**Pro Tip:** Mix and match chair styles to add visual interest without overspending. Pair a sleek modern chair with a cozy fabric armchair for a chic yet eclectic look.

# 2. Incorporate Stylish and Functional Stools

**Stools** are one of the most versatile furniture pieces you can add to your living room. They can double as extra seating, side tables, or even footrests. For a cohesive look, choose stools that complement your existing furniture.

* Wooden or metal stools work well in industrial and minimalist spaces.
* Upholstered stools with soft fabrics add warmth to cozy, traditional interiors.
* Boho-style living rooms pair beautifully with woven or textured stools.

**Budget Tip:** Check out second-hand or clearance sales to find unique and affordable options.

# 3. Elevate Your Space with Rattan Pieces

Bring natural charm into your living room with rattan furniture. While typically associated with outdoor settings, rattan pieces like a [rattan round coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/sanjuan-rattan-table) can seamlessly transition indoors. Its lightweight design and organic texture add a touch of warmth and sophistication to any living room.

* Pair a rattan round coffee table with a plush area rug for a cozy vibe.
* Use rattan baskets or trays to organize and accessorize your space.

**Style Tip:** Rattan complements both neutral palettes and colorful accents, making it a versatile choice for budget-friendly decor.

# 4. Repurpose Outdoor Furniture for Indoor Charm

Don’t overlook rattan outdoor furniture as a budget-friendly solution for your living room. A rattan loveseat or armchair can add texture and a laid-back feel to your interior. With the right cushions and throws, these pieces can feel just as cozy as traditional indoor furniture.

**Why Rattan Outdoor Furniture?** It’s affordable, durable, and easy to style for both indoor and outdoor spaces, making it a smart investment for your home.

# 5. Update Your Coffee Table or Side Tables

Switching out your coffee table or side tables can make a big impact. A rattan round coffee table is an excellent choice for adding an airy, natural element to your living room. It pairs beautifully with sofas and chairs while offering a practical surface for decor or drinks.

**Budget-Friendly Ideas:**

* Choose multi-functional tables with hidden storage.
* Opt for lightweight, affordable materials like rattan, MDF, or metal.
* Check thrift stores or online marketplaces for pre-loved treasures.

# 6. Accessorize Thoughtfully

While furniture forms the foundation of your living room, accessories can make it feel complete. Add a few affordable items like throw pillows, rugs, and lamps to enhance the overall look. Use baskets and trays to keep things tidy and stylish.

**Quick Budget Hacks:**

* Use stools as plant stands or makeshift shelves for decor.
* Layer a rattan or woven rug under your furniture for texture and warmth.
* Create DIY wall art to complement your furniture updates.

# 7. Embrace Multi-Functional Furniture

When working on a budget, furniture that serves multiple purposes is key. Stools with storage, convertible chairs, or nesting tables can save you money while maximizing functionality.

**Pro Tip:** Multi-functional pieces are especially valuable for small spaces, allowing you to refresh your living room without overcrowding it.

**Why Choose Budget-Friendly Furniture Updates?**

Transforming your living room doesn’t have to mean a complete overhaul. By incorporating affordable items like chairs for sale, versatile stools, and stylish pieces like a rattan round coffee table, you can create a refreshed, inviting space that suits your style and budget. Explore rattan outdoor furniture for unique options that bridge the gap between affordability and design.

The posting says that it is in very good shape. It has a single dose mod and bellows mod to reduce retention, plus different chute and a tilt mod.
From what I gather, doing a stepless mod should be relatively simple.

I don't own a espresso machine yet, but I plan to get it eventually. Currently I do V60 and moka pot with a Timemore C2, and grinding for the moka pot gets tiring.

I've read good things and bad things about Rocky:
The good:
Reliable, good quality grinder.
The bad:
Retention (looks like it's fixed),
smaller burrs than other grinders,
expensive (at this price it isn't, I think),
outdated design (what does that mean?)
Stepped adjustment (not with a stepless mod)

Is there a better grinder I can get for this price?
Is this a good first espresso grinder for this price?
Is there someone here with firsthand experience with this grinder?

Located in Czech republic. The grinder will be used for 2-4 doses of coffee per day. I would buy the grinder in person, so I can check something out before buying it.",0,1736842970.0,espresso,1,0.33,False

I only need the grate, as I've got the drip tray itself but our dog chewed up the grate part (guess he must like the taste or smell of coffee)

  
Anybody know where a replacement can be found?  I googled for it, but only found the grate once on eBay (and it looked only slightly better than our new dog chew toy, LOL ) but shipping was stupid high as was the grate itself for something that will cost all of about $1.50 in a padded mailer envelope.

  
I don't have to have one, our cups fit the bottom without using the drip tray but it looks weird without it on our counter and hate having to wipe off the drips after every cup.  
Anybody know where we can buy just the replacement grate?

I used a 20g in and 20g out recipie and got a 34 second shot time. I really enjoyed the flavour of the shot since it was much fuller than the standard espresso we serve but when i made it into a cortado, I've been left quite confused? I feel like the drink tastes milkier than usual but the coffee flavour isn't diluted is much? I can taste much more character than I would from the same coffee in a double shot. 

our standard recipie for a double espresso is 17g in to 32g out with around about a 24 second extraction. I work in a specialty café so it's light to medium roasts that we do ourselves! 

anyways, I've never tried a ristretto so I'd be keen to hear everyone's experience to see if that lines up!

I am hoping to extend my trip post i wrap up work in the week. I wish to take a train from London to Paris. I have a friend who lands in Paris to join me on the trip. We are 23F Indian women. 

Our interests range from pretty landscapes, to quintessential experiences in a city - good food and coffee. We are mid on history and architecture.

1- We plan to put up in Paris for 3 days, do one day trip to Versailles in these days.

2- Next morning, we plan to leave for Amsterdam. Spend two nights there.

3- Next morning, we plan to come to Brussels. Visit Ghent and Luxembourg from here. (2 nights, 3 days). 

On the third night - i have to fly back to London and my friend to Paris, from where we have our flights to India back.

Please suggest:
1- Must-dos at every stop and any other alternative day trips from Paris/Brussels
2- Sites we can book trains and buses from. (Reliable and cheapest options)
3- What parts of our journey should we take a bus/train/flight for? We have a checked in luggage each!

Note, we are not doing the traditional Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam route because commute from Amsterdam to London is way expensive than it is from Brussels. Similarly flights to India from Brussels and Amsterdam is way expensive than from Paris.",1,1736842312.0,Europetravel,0,1.0,False
