I just wanna ask you guys, since becoming a LW have you experienced what I call ‘skinny privilege’ and if so what’s your experience??

So for me it happened at work (I work in a restaurant), when I was a higher weight, at work I didn’t have many work buddies, especially among guys (I’m female), and there was lots of little things i would never be involved- never in photos for social media posts, never being offered the left over chips at work, never being asked if I wanted food from the shop if someone went on break, never being asked to be involved in fundraising companies. Anyway fast forward a year later and I’m at a LW, and the guys now talk to me, the girls wanna meet up outside of work for coffee, I’m always being asked to be in photos, everyone always offers me food. I just dunno who’s real or not anymore. Like why wasn’t I good enough for the guys before? Why wasn’t I good enough for the photos before? Just stresses me out that people are embarrassed by me when I’m not skinny. ",1,1736495920.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

I’ll be moving to Santiago in mid-January for three months and staying in the Providencia area, just a few minutes from Metro Los Leones.

It’s my first time in Chile, and I’d love your recommendations! Specifically:
	•	Shopping: Where can I buy groceries, fresh vegetables, bedsheets, towels, and toiletries (like shampoo)?
	•	Food & Coffee: Any great spots for coffee, breakfast, or lunch nearby?
	•	ATMs: Which ATMs are the safest for withdrawing money, especially for Bank of America customers?
	•	Fitness: I’m planning to go to the gym or maybe Pilates. Are there any gyms you’d recommend—or suggest avoiding? And is it possible to get a month-to-month membership instead of committing to a full year?
	•	Phone Carrier: What’s the best carrier to get, and how much should I expect to pay per month?
	•	Photography: Photography is a big hobby of mine! Are there any good places in Santiago for developing and scanning film? Also, I’d love to buy a film camera (something like a Canon AE-1), but I’m not sure if it’s better to buy it in Santiago or in the U.S.—any thoughts?

Thanks so much for your help! I’m really excited to experience Santiago and appreciate any advice you can share❤️",1,1736495827.0,Santiago,0,1.0,False
1hxzhnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hxzhnk/i_think_i_want_a_divorce_because_of_sex/,I think I want a divorce because of sex ,"My (35f) and  husband (40m) have been married  for  three years and together for almost seven, this is long and probably TMI to warn you. 

Neither of us want children, he’s my best friend, I  love him so much, he’s independent, funny, intelligent, generous, easy going, kind and assertive. He’s my perfect guy. 

He’s my favourite person, or he was. 

About six-seven months ago my husband wanted to  try some new things, I liked some and didn’t like some things, I was surprised by him wanting to degrade me and choke me, but it’s not my thing. So we moved on until this has all snowballed because Five months ago we got super drunk, very rarely happens, we both got home and had sex and ended up having anal sex. I absolutely consented at the time, but woke up feeling gross and sore about it.

We’d never done it before and unfortunately now my husband keeps asking for it. I explained I don’t like it, I don’t know why I wanted it when I was drunk, but it’s not happening again. We spoke about this years ago and it’s only ever come up once again and I shut it down.  

He said I must like it more than I want to admit, incorrect as I was just drunk and caught up in the no inhibitions sex we were having, I don’t know why I get like that when I’m sloshed, but I avoid getting so drunk usually as in my twenties I made bad decisions while drinking that I regret.

I genuinely don’t enjoy being degraded, choked or   Rough sex, so I don’t know why very drunk me does. I am happy to do other things, but just not these and after talking it out I agreed to try sober and we did. It was as unpleasant as I remember and I told him so. He now thinks I was being petty and not even trying to enjoy myself. 

He keeps asking to try new rough kinky things and gets annoyed when I don’t want to, if i ever say I’ve done it before and didn’t like it he gets more annoyed and says that was another man not him and it’s not fair to say if I haven’t tried it with him.

I don’t even want to have sex anymore, I dread it. It used to so romantic and now I feel anxious about it. I don’t judge others who enjoy kinkier things, I just don’t like it and I’m not going to be made to feel lesser than because of it. He’s started (sometimes) calling me names during dirty  talk that  has changed from more of a praise dirty talk to dirtier. I haven’t pulled him up which maybe I should have, but I decided to compromise as it’s not necessarily a turn on for me, but I can handle it if it turns him and it isn’t every time we have sex. 

It all came to a head when he asked to watch porn while we had sex, I don’t watch porn as it doesn’t really do anything for me, but I obliged. The video he played was very aggressive and made me feel sick, I’m sure it wouldn’t be so bad to most, but to me that stuff isn’t sexy.

The woman was repeatedly making gagging noises while giving a blowjob as the man was forcing her head down, he was calling her a “dirty whore” “a fucking slut” “a stupid bitch”,  he was fucking her in very uncomfortable looking positions and in the end there was anal involved. I understand people like that, I just don’t and never have and I’ve never been anything but forthcoming about it. 

Afterwards he looked happy and blissed out and I just said yes when he asked if I liked it, but naturally that was stupid as the next morning we sat down for coffee and he asked if we could recreate the video. I said no, but i had decided to indulge him and watching  porn sometimes to compromise, I didn’t say I was compromising I just said I would like to do that Occasionally. 

He got super angry and it turned into a fight. 

He asked if I was ever going to let him do anal again , I said no and for the final time no because I’m sick of repeating myself about something I don’t like. He said he was so sick of being married to a prude, that he’s wasted his most prime fucking years with me having vanilla sex and I don’t love him because I won’t even compromise and many women would do this for their husbands and enjoy it. 

I ended up leaving and going to my sisters. 

He’s called to apologise, but I told him if that’s how he felt I won’t waste anymore of his time and we can get a divorce because I refuse to feel like I have been for the last few months in my own home.

I lost my husband, but it felt like it was months ago, he used to be so kind and understanding, he’s never asked for these things or behaved like this about sex before, as far as I knew he was happy with our sex life, he said he was an we have sex 2-3 times a week or even 4-5 times a week sometimes. 

We used to be so playful and flirty and ever since the drunken night that’s slowly changed with all this going on. I don’t know what’s happened, I don’t know if I should divorce him or try therapy, but having to keep repeating my boundaries to him has drained me. My sister thinks it’s an early mid life crisis. 

He was crying and begging me to come home, he said he was out of line and didn’t mean the things he said, but I don’t know what more to do, we’ve had so many discussions in the last few months and everytime he seems to understand he’s back asking again. 

I just want my husband back, but I don’t think our marriage will recover. I’m still at my sisters and unsure if i should return home tonight. I’m just so confused, he’s never made me feel anything other safe before this, he’s never been an angry guy who yelled like that. I’m just devastated and I can’t help but think he’s wanted these things all along and just didn’t voice them. 

Just an edit- I have no hang ups about sex. I love sex. I love being restrained or restraining, I love semi public sex and I love role playing. It’s just never rough and degrading. I like praising and being praised, I like feeling desired and safe and to feel loved while having sex.  ",3,1736495713.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

(Long post, TL;DR at the bottom)

I (27F) have been working in this place for 4ish months. My manager (39F) was really supportive at first, she knew well I was fresh out of college, showed me the ropes, until she didn't. It started with personal disagreements, like small talk stuff that doesn't really matter. It's bound to happen, really. What really gets me going is her change in attitude. She has exactly contradictory expectations of me - I'm supposed to do certain duties, but also not, I can't regulate myself but I'm not supposed to show I'm stressed, I can't ask others to overlook my tasks while I'm gone for 5 minutes tops (it's routine here, everyone looks out for one another). I admit I've been slacking off, but I did get clear feedback and changed my ways. Now she scolds me for trying too much, calling it ""suspicious"". She demands I know as much as seasoned, 10+ years workers, but also infantilizes me whenever I make a mistake that has zero significance and is fixable in less than a minute. I asked exactly what she expects of me - it ended up with her saying ""yeah no you young people want everything on a silver platter, I never thought anyone would need it to be said"". The straw that broke camel's back was when she whined about me standing in a social room. It's a tiny room, I'd struggle to walk through to the other part, one of coworkers is older and she wouldn't even have space to let me pass through. Earlier on she whined about me being too leaned in, because I was eating my breakfast (again, routine thing that is actually encouraged) and she tried to look at other coworker. 

One day I simply burst out and told my more supportive coworkers (both ladies in their late 50s) that I'm genuinely scared of the manager. They offered more support than the manager ever did. 

Now, I'm an easy bullying target. I'm very introverted, shy, autistic, lesbian (I only refer to my girlfriend as my ""friend"", my closet is made out of glass lol), been bullied at school and the other workplace, hate gossiping, don't engage in small talk, don't share much about myself, don't care about bogus hierarchies and cliques, I'm literally only here to work, and on top of that I have severe migraines (half of my life are debilitating episodes, auras, pro- and postdromes) and it's draining my spoons. And she's the polar opposite - extroverted, intimidating, as neurotypical as NTs can get, high energy like (I'm sorry) a coked up rabbit, stays overtime just to drink coffee with other workers, she's (pardon my French) living breathing crapping this job. It feels like she can smell the weakling on me. Other than scolding me (in front of her clique friend), it'd pretty much never happened publicly. That day BTW, I had a meltdown and the only thing she worried about is that it looks to others like she's harassing me. 

Every day I feel like killing myself. I count on my genetics to take me out as my father's had 2 heart attacks before he was 40. I'm scared to look for anything else as it'll probably get worse too. I feel too powerless and trapped. Advice is appreciated, as well as basically any other form of support. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR My manager disagrees with everything I do, makes contradictory demands and gets pissed if I can't make it. I can't explain it other than her being personally against me.",1,1736495576.0,workplace_bullying,1,0.67,False

It's not inedible but it's a weird/undesirable smell.  It's not like anything I've smelled before.  I love coffee and prior to this I've had a highly attuned sense of smell.   Now I can't tell the difference between sage and cardamon.  It's so disorienting.   

I ordered one of those smell kits, and there was definitely a difference in various smells.  Seemed like it was improving overall.  I started to be able to smell all of my shampoos and soap with fragrance.   But just got another cold, and it's like it all went back to prior.  I can't even smell the citrus which before was pretty clear.  It's not that I am actually congested either. Is this how it happens? It gets better and then worse again?

1hxzf7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hxzf7t/sustainable_and_stylish_ecofriendly_home_decor/,Sustainable and Stylish: Eco-Friendly Home Decor Ideas,"Eco-friendly living isn’t just a trend—it’s a lifestyle that blends sustainability with style. By incorporating environmentally conscious materials and designs, you can create a home that’s both beautiful and kind to the planet. From [natural home decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to modern touches like a cozy [pouf](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs), this guide will inspire you to make eco-friendly choices while staying on top of design trends.

# 1. Start with Sustainable Materials

The foundation of eco-friendly [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) is using sustainable materials. Look for furniture and decor pieces made from reclaimed wood, bamboo, or rattan. These materials not only reduce environmental impact but also add warmth and texture to your spaces.

**Incorporate This:** Woven baskets or jute rugs, perfect for creating a rustic or [bohemian decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations) vibe. They pair well with plants and neutral tones, creating an earthy and relaxed atmosphere.

# 2. Bring Nature Indoors with Natural Elements

Nature-inspired decor creates a serene and grounded environment. Incorporate elements like driftwood, stones, or dried flowers into your natural home decoration. Adding houseplants not only improves air quality but also brings vibrant greenery into your home.

**Styling Tip:** Cluster plants of varying heights in woven planters or pair them with a textured pouf for a cozy and stylish corner.

# 3. Opt for Upcycled and Vintage Finds

Give old items a new lease on life by incorporating upcycled or vintage furniture and decor. From refurbished wooden coffee tables to reupholstered armchairs, these pieces add character while reducing waste.

**Why it Works:** Vintage items blend seamlessly with bohemian decor, thanks to their unique charm and eclectic appeal. A retro pouf, for example, can serve as a versatile accent piece in a living room or reading nook.

# 4. Choose Eco-Friendly Textiles

Sustainable fabrics like organic cotton, hemp, and linen are perfect for curtains, cushions, and throws. These materials are biodegradable, soft, and durable. Look for items dyed with natural pigments to avoid harmful chemicals.

**Layering Idea:** Add a macramé wall hanging or a throw made of organic cotton to complement bohemian decor and enhance the cozy, eco-friendly vibe of your space.

# 5. Invest in Multifunctional Furniture

Eco-friendly living also means making the most of what you own. Opt for multifunctional furniture that minimizes the need for multiple pieces. A pouf is an excellent example—it can serve as extra seating, a footrest, or even a small table when topped with a tray.

**Pro Tip:** Look for poufs made from sustainable materials like recycled fabric or jute to align with your eco-friendly goals.

# 6. Light Up Sustainably

Lighting can significantly impact the ambiance of a room. Choose energy-efficient options like LED bulbs and fixtures made from recycled or natural materials. Bamboo pendant lights, for instance, are both stylish and sustainable.

**Bonus:** String lights or lanterns fit beautifully into bohemian decor, creating a warm and inviting glow in any room.

# 7. Decorate with Purpose

Every piece of decor in your home should have a purpose, whether it’s aesthetic, functional, or both. Avoid clutter by choosing items that resonate with your personal style while adding value to your space.

**Eco-Friendly Decor Must-Haves:**

* Handwoven baskets for storage.
* Ceramic vases for fresh or dried flowers.
* Textured poufs for versatile seating.

These elements seamlessly integrate into natural home decoration, creating a harmonious and clutter-free environment.

# 8. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Sustainability begins with mindful consumption. Repurpose items you already own instead of buying new ones. Turn an old ladder into a stylish shelving unit or use mason jars as vases. These DIY projects not only save money but also add a personal touch to your decor.

**Why Choose Eco-Friendly Home Decor?**

By opting for sustainable and natural home decoration, you reduce your environmental footprint while curating a space that feels authentic and welcoming. Whether you’re drawn to bohemian decor or prefer minimalist styles, eco-friendly choices ensure your home reflects your values.

**Final Thoughts**

Sustainable living doesn’t mean compromising on style. By incorporating natural materials, vintage finds, and multifunctional pieces like a pouf, you can create a home that’s both chic and environmentally responsible. Start small, and over time, transform your space into a haven of eco-friendly elegance.

I can only imagine what emotional situation they had to go through to think that this is a thing that should be said.

I think alot of this can be attributed to the bad things of violent nature happened in recent past, and now some have guilt trapped so many people into thinking that it's their soft duty to overcompensate for what those criminals did.

1hxz86y,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Expert/comments/1hxz86y/the_role_of_vpns_in_zero_trust_architecture/,The Role of VPNs in Zero Trust Architecture,"As businesses move more of their operations online, cybersecurity becomes an increasingly important priority. One security model that has gained traction in recent years is Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), which assumes that no one—inside or outside the organization—should be trusted by default. Instead, every user, device, and network request is continually verified before access is granted. In this post, we’ll explore the role of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) in Zero Trust Architecture, how they fit into the security framework, and why they remain an essential tool for protecting modern business networks.

1. What is Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)?

Zero Trust Architecture is a security framework that operates on the principle of ""never trust, always verify."" In a Zero Trust model, the network is treated as if it’s always hostile, and access to resources is granted based on strict authentication and continuous monitoring.

Key principles of Zero Trust:

Verify everything: Every device, user, and network request must be authenticated before access is granted, regardless of whether the request comes from inside or outside the organization.

Least Privilege Access: Users are only given access to the resources necessary for their role, minimizing the potential damage from compromised accounts.

Micro-Segmentation: The network is segmented into smaller zones, with users only able to access specific sections based on their permissions.

Continuous Monitoring: Instead of relying on perimeter-based security, Zero Trust continuously monitors user activity and network traffic to detect and respond to threats in real time.

2. The Role of VPNs in Zero Trust Architecture

A VPN is a crucial tool that can help implement the Zero Trust principles by providing secure and encrypted connections, especially for remote workers and branch offices. Let’s break down how VPNs fit into the Zero Trust model:

2.1. Secure Remote Access for Remote Workers

In a traditional network, employees could simply connect to the company’s internal network from within the office, trusting that everything on the network was secure. With Zero Trust, this assumption is eliminated. For remote workers or branch offices, a VPN ensures that all traffic is encrypted and authenticated before connecting to internal resources.

Why it matters: VPNs allow remote users to securely access internal systems without exposing sensitive data to public or unsecured networks, ensuring that all traffic is protected, even when employees are working from outside the office.

2.2. Strong Authentication and Encryption

Zero Trust relies on strong authentication to verify the identity of users and devices. VPNs add an additional layer of protection by encrypting data between the user and the network, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept or tamper with sensitive information.

Why it matters: End-to-end encryption via VPN ensures that all data transmitted between users and corporate systems remains private, reducing the risk of interception or data leaks. This is particularly important in a Zero Trust environment, where continuous verification of both the user’s identity and the integrity of the communication is required.

2.3. Micro-Segmentation with VPNs

A core component of Zero Trust is micro-segmentation, which involves dividing the network into smaller zones and controlling access to each zone. While VPNs alone don’t provide micro-segmentation, they play a key role in ensuring that only authorized users can access specific segments of the network. For example, a VPN can restrict access to sensitive data or certain applications based on the user’s role and permissions.

Why it matters: By enforcing access controls through VPNs, organizations can ensure that users can only connect to the resources they are authorized to use, in alignment with the Zero Trust principle of least privilege.

2.4. Network Traffic Inspection and Monitoring

Zero Trust requires continuous monitoring of all network traffic to detect potential threats. VPNs, when integrated with network security monitoring tools, can assist in inspecting traffic for anomalies and suspicious activity. By inspecting both inbound and outbound traffic, companies can identify unauthorized access attempts or other malicious activities.

Why it matters: VPNs help organizations detect potential threats in real time, supporting the continuous monitoring aspect of Zero Trust and providing immediate alerts when something suspicious happens.

2.5. Protecting the Perimeter and Internal Resources

While Zero Trust moves away from the traditional perimeter-based security model, the network perimeter still plays an important role. VPNs act as a perimeter defense for remote users and external connections, ensuring that access to internal resources is granted only to trusted users and devices.

Why it matters: In a Zero Trust architecture, VPNs help secure the perimeter by ensuring that only authenticated and encrypted connections are allowed into the internal network, which is especially important as the perimeter becomes more complex with the increase in remote work and cloud services.

3. Benefits of Using VPNs in Zero Trust Architecture

Integrating VPNs into a Zero Trust model provides several key benefits:

3.1. Increased Security for Remote Work

As more companies embrace remote work, securing connections to the company’s internal network becomes a top priority. VPNs encrypt the internet connection, making it safer for remote employees to access corporate data and systems from home, coffee shops, or any location with internet access.

Why it matters: The VPN ensures that sensitive data remains protected even if employees are accessing it over unsecured public Wi-Fi networks, which could otherwise be a target for hackers.

3.2. Reduced Attack Surface

By enforcing strong authentication and encryption, VPNs can help reduce the overall attack surface of an organization. With Zero Trust, the risk of lateral movement (where attackers gain access to one part of the network and move to other sections) is minimized, and VPNs can help secure the paths between users and the resources they access.

Why it matters: By limiting access to the necessary resources and encrypting traffic, VPNs reduce the chances of attackers gaining access to sensitive data or spreading across the network.

3.3. Flexibility and Scalability

VPNs are flexible and scalable, allowing organizations to add or remove users quickly as needed. Whether it’s adding new remote employees, contractors, or third-party vendors, VPNs provide an easy way to scale access while maintaining strict security protocols.

Why it matters: As businesses grow and evolve, a scalable VPN solution ensures that new employees or partners can be securely integrated into the network without compromising security.

4. Potential Risks and Challenges of VPNs in Zero Trust

While VPNs play a significant role in Zero Trust, there are also some challenges and risks to consider:

4.1. VPN Reliance and Single Point of Failure

If the VPN infrastructure fails, it can disrupt access to critical systems and data, leading to a potential bottleneck or downtime. In Zero Trust, this reliance on VPNs could be a risk if the VPN server becomes compromised or unavailable.

Why it matters: Organizations must ensure their VPN infrastructure is robust, with high availability and redundancy to avoid disruptions. Additionally, it’s important to combine VPNs with other security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and intrusion detection systems.

4.2. VPN Bypass by Malicious Actors

Sophisticated attackers may attempt to bypass VPNs or exploit weaknesses in VPN configurations to gain unauthorized access. This is why it’s important to combine VPNs with other layers of security within the Zero Trust model, such as endpoint security and continuous authentication.

Why it matters: A single-layer defense, like a VPN, is not enough. Zero Trust requires a multi-layered approach to ensure that attackers can’t circumvent security measures.

5. Conclusion

Incorporating VPNs into a Zero Trust Architecture plays a vital role in securing remote access, encrypting data, and providing strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access. VPNs help enforce the never trust, always verify principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive data, even when connecting remotely.

While VPNs provide significant security benefits, it’s important to implement them as part of a broader, multi-layered security strategy. VPNs should be integrated with other Zero Trust components, such as micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, and advanced threat detection, to create a comprehensive defense against modern cyber threats.

I've been a graphic designer and video editor for a while now, but man, I still remember those early days like they were yesterday. You know that frustrating cycle - can't get clients without a portfolio, can't build a portfolio without clients? Yeah, that one hit hard.

I was sitting in a coffee shop yesterday (probably had too much caffeine 😅), thinking about how many talented people are stuck in this same loop. Then it hit me - startups are facing the flip side of this coin, right? They need quality creative work but can't shell out agency-level prices while they're still running on ramen and dreams.

So here's what's been brewing in my mind: What if we created a platform that connects fresh, hungry talent with early-stage startups? Kind of like a ""first steps"" marketplace where:

• New freelancers can land their first real gigs and build their portfolio
• Startups can get solid creative work without breaking the bank

I'm not talking about another race-to-the-bottom freelance site. Think more like a curated community where everyone understands they're helping each other grow.

I'd really love to hear from both sides of the table:

If you're a freelancer: How did you land your first client? What would have made that journey easier?

If you're with a startup: How do you currently handle your creative needs? Would you work with newer freelancers if there was some quality assurance?

And the million-dollar question: Is this something that would have helped you when you were starting out?

Shoot straight with me - I can take it! Would love to hear your war stories and insights. 🎯",2,1736494388.0,SomebodyMakeThis,0,1.0,False

I’m afraid people may comment on boasting and all but I feel if people with experience can help me even in one thing, It would help me. Thank you for all the suggestions I may get in advance.

I earn around 1.55 lac/month post taxes, in Mumbai. And my expenses mostly include housing (35k), pets maintenance (10-15k), groceries (basic, and heavy on coffee) 10k, office travel (autos) 10k, offline movies - 5k, subscriptions - 1k, Cafes/Bars - 10-15k, Shopping - 5k.

Mostly around 80k-90k expenditure.

Rest of it goes to ELSS, NPS. I know I may earn well in few small/mid caps or smallcase. Have tried but I don’t want the option to be able to withdraw whenever I need, so that I control on my impulsive buying.

I prefer to live debt-free as I’ve misused alot on credit cards, loans few years back. Those credits have made me save zero for almost 6 years.

Suggestions I need on :

1. Are there any other financial elements that can help me earn more returns while keeping the amount locked in for minimum of 3-5 years?

2. Should I use a credit card to earn some rewards/cashback that may help save further? If yes, is there is a credit card that suits my expenditure. That can allow me certain credit limit locked and won’t let me use beyond that. (Incl. occasional online food deliveries). One more point to be considered here is, I want to use my free time to either relax, upskill, spend time with my pets. 

Does it make sense to get into hassle of exploring where I can get things cheaper/rewards than utilising my time in something more useful? My goal is to work hard for next 5-7 years, upskill as much as I can, earn well, and then shift to something that gives me stable income and a balanced lifestyle.

3. My house owner asks for 18% GST if I have to use his PAN to save on HRA, Which is 6k more. Though I know we can just use a friend’s PAN or something and save this, are there any legitimate solutions for this?

Any other suggestions are welcome too, open to questions/discussions so that I can figure this out at once.",1,1736494385.0,personalfinanceindia,0,1.0,False
1hxz51n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1hxz51n/event_keep_your_friends_close/,[EVENT] Keep your friends close,"**Thiem Nam Restaurant, Công Lý Street, Saigon**

Trần Thiện Khiêm sipped idly from a glass of Sancerre as he waited for his guests to arrive. The forty-six year old Catholic former general had been Prime Minister for longer than any previous incumbent, and been in politics far before that. He knew how to play the game, and he knew it well. Major events caused instability and chaos, but also opened opportunities. And this major offensive the Communists had just launched provided one such opportunity. His old friend the obstinate President Thieu was reacting very much in the way he had come to expect; micro-managing every minor detail and working himself into a frenzy while losing sight of the bigger picture. Thieu was older, but through circumstance had been a junior of his at Da Lat. Even as a junior officer he had shown the excessive caution which has since become his trademark. They had become fast friends since, despite their stark contrast in personalities, with Khiêm being a gambler and schemer *par excellence*. 

His thoughts about their journeys were interrupted as he spotted the first of his guests starting to arrive, chuckling slightly. Dressed in an immaculately tailored linen suit and with his hair neatly slicked back as was his trademark style, forty-two year old Nguyễn Cao Kỳ was every bit the prima donna as he strode in towards their table. Energetic, tempestuous and flashy, the former Air Force commander was about the most polarising figure in Vietnam, but he still had a loyal power base among his former men and an odd following in some parts of the Buddhist community.

""I trust the traffic wasn't too bad?"" said Khiêm to his predecessor and former colleague as he rose from his seat to greet him ""It was fine, though I should not have been surprised that you would pick this place"" replied Kỳ tersely. The two men had not exactly seen eye-to-eye, and since the breakup of the Thieu-Kỳ partnership they had been political rivals. ""So who else are we expecting"" Kỳ said as he saw the table laid out for two more guests. ""All in due time. Can I get you something to drink?"" replied Khiêm coolly as a waiter appeared behind him with a drinks menu and took his order, nodding approvingly at his choice before departing, crossing paths with the third member of the dinner party.

It was hard to ignore the presence of Dương Văn Minh wherever he went. The grizzled soldier-statesman towered over most of his compatriots, standing at 1.83m and 90kg in a country where most men were usually two-thirds the size. The former President and general cocked his head slightly on seeing Kỳ, trying to maintain a calm. Kỳ for his own part glared at Khiêm, who seemed bemused but betrayed no other emotion as Minh made his way and sat down. 

""General Minh, pleased to have you join us"" Khiêm greeted the older man with an affected warmth while Kỳ glowered. The two men had despised each other for nearly a decade since Kỳ's leading role in the Young Turks clique and his part in unseating Minh. ""I wish I could say the same, but I am not sure I can given the present company"" replied Minh, his face stoic but his tone dripping with contempt as he glanced towards Kỳ. The dinner was already off to a great start, and the fourth guest hadn't even arrived. ""But then again, I should have known you two would be up to your usual tricks. It looks like old habits die hard, don't they?"" Minh said cuttingly as a waiter delivered his drink. Khiêm removed his glasses and wiped a smudge away with his necktie ""All due respect General, I urge you to wait until you listen to my proposal, but beforehand we should wait for our final guest"" he placed his glasses back onto his nose. 

""Ah, and speaking of whom, here he is"" he remarked as the final party of their quartet, Trần Văn Hương, shuffled into the room, huffing slightly. The seventy year old was a longtime political operative, and while he was plagued with asthma and rheumatism, his political instincts were still as sharp as ever. The old man raised an eyebrow at the assortment of guests and then smiled at Khiêm, beginning to recognise the game he was playing. Khiêm returned his smile curteously as Hương took his seat.

A smartly dressed waiter arrived with their menus before rattling off the day's specials and took them men's orders. Minh and Hương ordering local favourites while Khiêm went for a steak and Kỳ his all-time favourite, Sole Meuniere. The tension was palpable as the waiter walked to the kitchen, the men exchanging glances around the table as Khiêm cleared his throat.

""Gentlemen, thank you all for accepting my invitation. I was not sure if you were all going to come but I am very glad that you did. I am sure you are wondering why I brought you all here, besides the fantastic food served here of course"" he began before he was interrupted by the hot-headed Kỳ ""Enough of the charade Khiêm, let's be honest, you're planning something against Thieu and you've come hat in hand for our help"" saying out loud what everyone was already thinking quietly. Khiêm pretended to ignore Kỳ. ""Our nation is under attack, an attack the scale of which we have not seen in our history, bigger than Tet I am certain. Our President, bless him, is trying his best to lead the nation in this crisis"" the sarcasm was obvious in his voice ""but it is clear that he alone cannot solve our problems. I know none of us here around this table particularly like each other very much. I don't intend to make us friends over this. But I want us to come together, for the sake of our nation's very survival. Once this crisis is over and the situation stable, we can again go happily to our former selves"".

The play was obvious; close ranks, rally around the flag. But the big question of Khiêm's benefit in all this was hanging. There was no way he was doing this for altruistic reasons. Minh was first to speak ""Very admirable, Prime Minister. But tell me, if you are doing this for the security of our nation, why is it you who is calling this, and over a fine dinner, and not something from Independence Palace? What is in it for you? And what are we to gain from such a display of patriotism, and, I assume, subservience to our beloved President?"" Minh's own distaste for the younger man was evident. 

""Thieu is too proud and too stubborn to work with anyone but himself. We all know this, and no-one better than myself and the Vice President. If we unite, however temporarily, we can force his hand and make him listen to more than just himself in how to conduct this war and indeed this administration, and of course ensure things are properly run""

A laugh from Big Minh interrupted Khiêm's words ""Spare me your grandstanding. You Young Turks never change do you? Sly off the cuff negotiations, deals behind closed doors, scheming one regime change after another. You want to move against Thieu but lack the strength, so now you come to us thinking we'll play along. But for what end, future President Khiêm? What does South Vietnam get for all this except exchanging one Catholic general for another?"" 

Before a reply could be made, tension was somewhat dissipated by the arrival of the waiters with their food, and for a moment silence descended over the table as the men tucked into their meals. Then as Khiem prepared to speak he was interrupted by a bout of coughing and wheezing from Hương, though he suspected it was feigned to allow him to seize the flow of the conversation. ""Gentlemen, we are getting nowhere. None of us trust each other or like other very much, none of us have to, but the Prime Minister is right. Thieu is going to run our country into the ground, and we have a chance to clip his wings and make him see reason. So let me propose a solution. We form a united front for the duration of this emergency. General Kỳ will join the cabinet as...shall we say Deputy Prime Minister, along with the appointment of your friend Nguyễn Đức Thắng to something as well. General Minh, I am sure you would be suitable either in cabinet or working in Independence Palace itself, perhaps with a special assignment"". Kỳ was content with the proposal, seeing a chance to begin to rebuild his shattered base of support within the administration, but the big man did not seem pacified.

""I do not fold easily, Mr. Hương"" replied Minh ""especially not to upstarts who suddenly need my help. Even if I agree to go along with your little scheme I will only do it for more meaningful change than three telephones. Diem has done that to me before, why would I do it for someone even less impressive and convincing?""

""I'll get the 20-year rule repealed"" Khiêm shot back as Kỳ moved to speak but stopped. The rule on forcible retirement of officers after 20 years continuous service had been something the Young Turks had championed to remove the older generals' clique of Minh from office. In a face-based culture, such a law had been seen as hugely disrespectful . Minh looked passively, then leant back into his seat. Quietly the men finished their meal and the plates were cleared. A breakthrough had been made. A deal was on the table

""Well gentlemen, this has proven a most...productive encounter. We really should do this more often. Now, does anyone want dessert or coffee?""",3,1736494112.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False
1hxz3ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hxz3ik/coffee_grinder_for_quick_mill_pippa_and_la_pavoni/,Coffee grinder for Quick Mill Pippa and La Pavoni (lever),"Hi! I recently bought a Quick Mill Pippa espresso machine. For several years I had a DeLonghi Dedica along with a Wilfa grinder (some cheaper model) and at the time I didn't think much about the quality of the espresso and coffee beans in general. About a year ago I switched to a drip and in the meantime I also bought a Timemore Chestnut S3 hand grinder. Thanks to the transfer, I began to pick up the first flavor nuances and discover different coffee flavor profiles. Thus, the idea of going back to a pressurized coffee maker occurred to me. After a month of pondering, I acquired the Quick Mill mentioned at the beginning, leaving the Timemore grinder for initial use. Unfortunately, after a month of testing, I can't come to the right taste of espresso. Most of the time it comes out sour (despite purchased ""sweet"" coffee blends) and occasionally tart. I eliminated one by one the possible shortcomings, but the taste does not improve. It seems to me that at this stage I should acquire a more precise grinder. I rather bet on some sort of electric for the moment. I guess I would also aim for a single dose, because I drink coffee alone and usually one a day, so I don't want more coffee lying around in the hopper. Could I ask you to recommend something reasonable? Budget 800 €. I'll also add that when I tame the current espresso machine I also want to get interested in a La Pavoni lever machine so it would be nice if the mill was ready to grind for that machine. My preliminary (very preliminary, as I have a vague idea) suggestions are:

I was his first grandchild, he was a rough man, experienced only loss in his life and hardship, he found his little brother half decaying hanging off a tree in the forest. He’s never shown any emotions and was a complicated, silent man with a stern face. He never cared about his children with love, he only prepared them for the world. But I was his first grandchild, a little girl who changed him completely. He’s only ever shown me love, he taught me how to draw, he took me with him to his work, he took me out to eat and drink coffee at a small, old diner. He made me a fence so I could learn to walk, he did everything with me.. and for me. And he passed. Last year in August, he was 77 and I am 24 now. He battled lung cancer, which spread all the way to his neck, throat, face and all over his body. He couldn’t eat, couldn’t walk, and only slept. I stayed with him, I fed him, I gave him love, but most importantly I always told him I loved him before I left, and he did too. 

His organs shut down one morning as I was at sea, i was miles and miles away and never got to see him. I cried, I cried and cried and it hurt so bad my whole body stopped functioning. I didn’t eat and I didn’t sleep. I started having panic attacks, severe, long lasting. It changed me completely. 

I blame myself for not visiting him more often, I blame myself I wasn’t there when the ambulance took him away, I am mad at myself I only ever touched a tin box with his ashes inside and never got to hold his hand again even in death. I BLAME MYSELF I WASN’T THERE. 

I admit I go to his grave every single night as I am driving home from work, I sit there in darkness at an empty cemetery and cry my lungs out. I bring flowers, stones, and candles and I cry endlessly. I am going through a rough patch right now with my partner, he just lost his job, and we’re both VERY unstable, we got a rundown house to take care of because my partners dad passed away too not to long ago, we’re taking all of his burdens, we need to pay back all the money of the debts he’s made. We’re in hell. 

I admit I begged my grandpa to send me I sign, to calm me down, to help me find a way like he always used to do. I wish he was here now that I need a new fence for my house (he was a renowned blacksmith)… I wish he was here to help me. 

Today, I woke up and made myself coffee, and it was snowing outside, for the first time again in 10 years it’s snowing. And I know he’s heard my cry. ",1,1736493889.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

this is mostly ranting about my old job and my petty revenge at the end

During the first year of the pandemic I (32 m) was let go from my old work and started this job. This company lets call it PMM, produced ""Containers"" for the military arm of the government and were seen as  Essential services, that allowed to stay open while most jobs were force to remain closed during the middle of the pandemic.

The job was to shape, cut and fit pre formed sheets of metal using hand tools like grinders and files into container,  these boxes were 5 feet long with space for tubes and other parts. A finish one needed to pass very strict tolerance, shape and pressure tests and a single fail would reject it  and force us to scrap them.

I was good  at my job,  each container took me around 3 hours from start to finish and in a 10 hours shift i can finish 3 a day while my co workers could finish 2 or less. This place hire anyone with basic  workshop knowledge, basically if you can hold a grinder and cut  a mostly straight line they would hire you and put you in the production line.

The shop manager was actually pretty cool, she was a short woman, body builder, biker  and welder. I been there less than a month and in her own words i was producing more than people that been there for a year, so basically she like me  very much. The shop had long hours 10-12 hours shifts easy 60 hours weakly some times more, we had weekends off but if the production was low we had to work Saturdays some times Sundays just to try to catch up. lots of people only stayed for  like 6 months and they were burn out, honestly i was only there until my old job re open after the pandemic. this company did not fire anyone they just had to wait for people to leave on their own.

like in many places over time is ""optional"" but we had to produce a minimun number of containers each month, and the later in the month the more hours we had work.  if we did not finish the quota they moved the number to the next month making it a even bigger quota.

On our yearly review we were given a production report, basically 1-10 score in the quality of your work. I was the new one and got just a 6, a little low but technically i am the new guy and the less experienced in the shop, but the highest score was just an 8. The guy that got an 8 was also the one that trained me and teach me to do the actual job, lets call him Erick.  
i asked him ""wait, should not you have an automatic 10?? ""  
he ask me what do i mean 8 is a good number.  
""i mean, we don't have blue prints, production manuals, tutorials or instructions, you teach me how to assemble the containers, with that logic  you are the most knowledge and skilled in the department, if you don't get an automatic 10 who can get a 10????"" he just smirked and told me ""yes technically you are right but no one will even get a 10  here, they would need to give you a raise if you get a score over 9"".  Erik  was close to 65 , basically he was only riding the  job until  retirement and is the one that been in the workshop the longest, he did not care about yearly reviews.

One day we had a sign in the break room that says  ""to celebrate 12 months with unreported accidents we will provide lunch  in a food truck as a congrats for your effort "" is funny because a co worker just  had a pipe fell in his head a week before, i guess the company did not care to ""report"" that incident.

Around my 9th month, we had a meeting in the workshop and there was a guy there i never seen before, he was there  to explain how the company was going to implement a new robot arm with automatic welding capabilities that would  increase our production.  
He explained that there is nothing to worry, the operations of the work shop will be the same and he is here to answer any questions.  
Well i had some questions ""sorry question here, who will operate the  robot welder?"",  
he ""well, no one, that's the whole point of the robot arm is automatic.""  
me ""no, i get that, but who will operate the robot? there will be a technician running and programing the machine every single time we need to run it?""  
he "" no, the arm is pre programed you will only need to bring  the box to it and it will weld the box by itself""  
me ""ok lets say its that easy, but what if there is a mistake, what if it loses calibration or is just not functioning ,there wont be a person supervising it and repairing it. for example a printer gets jam all the time, a robot arm have 1000 more moving parts  there is a high rate of failure or error ""  
he ""we have a technician on call  for maintenance  don't worry""  
me ""so if it fail we cant weld and will stop production until an off site technician come and fix it ? ""  
he ""look i understand  you guys are worried  because this is a big change, but we are a million dollar company and this machine will help you guys to be more productive""  
By hearing that i could not stop and chuckle a little bit  and he asked me a little annoyed now ""what so funny exactly ??""  
me ""sorry  is that, you said we are a million dollar company  but all our tools are from Harbor Freight "" for those who don't know  Harbor Freight is a hardware store company that basically sell Chinese tools that are design to be cheap but not to last, so is  the cheapest equipment you can buy on the market. By that point i was a litle annoyed and well if  i already open my big mouth might as well go all in ""i have another question, what this company name ??""  
he very confused ""what do you mean ??""  
me ""what's this company name ??""  
he answer ""the company is called PMM""  
me ""no, that's the initials  of the company i meant what those initials stand for ????""  
he a with some attitude  ""they stand for ""Precision metal manufacturing"" (fake name ). me ""precision is the name of the company yet we are having a bigger number of containers failing inspection each month. We have no quality in our work and the more containers that fail, the more behind we are in out monthly quota. By the way each month the quota is bigger each month. We are over worked, when we are tired we make mistakes, the containers get  rejected and set us even farter away from the quota.""  
he quite piss at that point ""we must deliver those quotas no mater what, if we fail the company could get in trouble that's the whole reason we are optimizing the workshop"" me ""well each month the number is getting bigger  the company is literally selling a number that is not feasible to produce. The only way we can increase quality is with less hours of work, not working on Sundays"" and after that my coworkers were looking me with weird expressions, some were worried others just holding a laugh after that they were also complaining for the long hours  and the lack of quality equipment. the guy taking questions did not answer anything more  and just left  the workshop.

After he left Erick came to me to congrat me for speaking for the shop and asked me ""you know who was that guy?? ""  
me ""honest no clue never seen him""  
Erick "" he is the site manager  he is just under the owner in the leadership ladder ""  
me ""mmmmmmmm  well  i guess i made myself  ""persona non grata"" in the company"".

To make the rest of the story short the robot arm never worked, they test it for around 5 months, but the  welding of the containers is very specific and the robot could not replicate it and pass the quality tests needed for approval. My manager told me that it was a prototype they bought but never got it to work. The engineer   we had on call to fix it was located in the next town over and had to drive almost 2 hours just to try to fix the  machine.

Of course  they throw my manager under the bridge, but instead of taking the blame of the lost production she just quit. My manager got a job right away  in a different company. she try to take me with her  to the new company but it was quite far away from my  current location and was not ready for a 3 hour travel each day.  
Erick told me he was looking around and find an job ad  for ""art metal worker wanted"" the location was like 5 minutes away and the pay was the same but 20 hours less work. i understood that with my manager gone and Erick  showing me other job offers  i was next in the chopping block, so  i apply for the job and got it.  Gave my 2 weeks notice the next day

here is the petty revenge, went to the site manager office  and the door was open so i just went in  
""hey  site manager, today is my last day in the company , just wanted to say  good bay and thank you for giving me a chance to be employed  during the pandemic, i could not have survived without this job""  
he was a little surprised and say ""amm...  you are welcome, you are leaving today??.........how much are you making in  your new job??"",  
me "" yes i am leaving right now actually,  and yes i am making 10 dlls more an hour in my new job""  
he ""well, good bay "" the last day of work i just went all over the shop, and put a local  metal worker union sticker everywhere i could hide one, inside the tool boxes under the mat, on the side of the clock in machine, under the toilet seat, in the restroom mirror, the break room table, the fridge under the lid of the coffee machine.  my favorite  locations were on the HR bulletin board and on  the frame of the door of the site manager.  my friends in the company told me they are still finding  those stickers even a year after i left

[Breville Barista Express],"Hi there! I'm somewhat new to the world of espresso and home-brewed coffee in general. A little over two months ago, I got lucky and received the BBE for free; A family's workplace was throwing it out–  practically brand new– and upgrading to something else since nobody really knew how to use it.

I've really been enjoying this machine since then! I've been watching James Hoffmann and Lance Hedrik's videos, and learning to dial-in has been a fun process; however the tuning process for some beans has been pretty frustrating, and I can kind of understand how my family member's coworkers just didn't have the patience for it haha.

I've been using pretty cheap super-market beans for the past couple months while I'm learning-- I've managed to get a couple ""good"" shots, but mostly ""okay"" shots (although still vastly better than the Tim Hortons and Starbucks that I've been drinking up till now). However, sometimes I feel like I end up going through almost 1/4 of a 1kg bag just to get the grind size to something somewhat drinkable, and I can reach nearly the end of the bag, making minor adjustments every morning, and still have my shots taste sour.

Getting to the point-- I think my main frustration here might be the step sizes on the BBE grinder? The main issue I often have while dialing in is that when I use one grind size, the shot will flow way too fast; but when I *find grinder* by 1 step, the shot will choke. So I end up trying to make micro-changes by changing the dose and flipping between the sizes, and it ends up eating up a ton of beans.

* Cheapo Starbucks Dark Roast (which I get is sacrilege around here, but my sweet mother found out I'd gotten into coffee and bought me more than a couple bulk bags of different blends. So I'll be using these for a while.)
* Starting with 16.3g Dose
* WDT, tap once on table to collapse grinds, tamp with the stock tamper
* Manual pull with 9-10s infusion
* Aiming for \~32g yield in 30s, measured using a scale

However, with this bean I haven't been able to hit my yield without it tasting over/under-extracted.

# My findings with each grind size:

**Size 5-4**: With \~16.4g Runs way too fast; sour and watery

**Size 2**:

* \~16.7g, yields \~18g in 30s, very slow drips.
* This didn't actually taste all that bad; a bit on the sour side but it was actually sweet. Very thin crema.

**Size 1**:

* 16.3g dose; 36g in 30s
* Espresso runs in a very thin stream. Very thin crema. Within my time, but it tastes quite muddy. (I suspect it flowed faster than size 2 because it was so fine, the flow became uneven?)

From here, I figured the ideal grind size should be between 2 and 3. So I began playing with the dose to get something that works;

**Size 2**:

* Tried \~16.3g \~20g in \~32s the morning after
   * Drips were very slow again, but it was intensely sour.
* \~15g-- shot ran too fast and the puck was practically soup. Very sour.

**Size 3**:

I figured that since size 4 ran too fast and size 2 was pretty close to my ideal time and yield, I should try to up-dose by a gram to get the time close to what I wanted with this larger grind size.

* Dosed 17.7g, \~15g in 30s;
   * (In hindsight I should have tried 17.3g first. I'd pulled so many shots at this point that I'd forgotten that 16.7g choked it pretty badly).
   * The shot choked and dripped slowly. Very sour and bitter simultaneously.
* Dropped it down to 16g; 50g in \~18s.
   * Tasted very watery, and the puck was also soupy.
* 17g dose; 40g yield in 23s.
   * This is probably the closest I've gotten to my yield within the right time on size 3.
   * But, it still tastes very sour.

Out of these, I’d have to say that the accidental ristretto at grind size 2 and the weirdly fast shot at size 1 ended up being the most “drinkable”, as they didn’t come out as sour as the other shots. I guess my next move would be to try a 17.4g dose at size 3, and if that doesn’t work… then drop back down to size 2 and try 15.5-16g. But that will have to wait for tomorrow since I’ve already gone through an entire tank of water this afternoon trying to get this right.

So– am I doing something wrong here, or does the grinder just not have enough steps for some beans? I don’t mind saving up for a hand-grinder if it’ll make the dial-in process easier (I’ve had my eye on the Kingrinder K6 and 1zpresso J-Ultra; but the K6 is a bit expensive to import so I'm no sure which would be considered better value). I’ve heard that dialling in fresh beans can make things easier, but I’m a bit apprehensive with how much I tend to waste during the process– my local roasters' go for around $20 USD for a 300g bag at the cheapest, and in the past few months I’ve found that around half or more of that would be dumped down the sink :/. 

I appreciate any advice or tips! ",2,1736493594.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

We met in 2019 when I had a teaching gig for six months and kept in touch since then.

We hanged out once a year, I’m not one to go out, something that he understood and gave me my space.
Also he lived in another city most years but recent years he was in the same city; when we did go out we talked for hours.

On december 29th he responded to a story of mine, and I talked a bit, he asked if I wanted to go for coffee, I asked him if he was in another city and he said not at this moment, but I didn’t continue the conversation.
Christmas and new year came, my job consumed me in those weeks.

Yesterday a coworker in common told me the bad news that he passed away, a sudden heartattack, he was 28 years old.

I’m still in shock and I have so much guilt from things I didn’t do, I think about him and he was so kind to me and one of the few people that liked me for who I am.
I’ll always remember that he was my support in that awful year at that teaching gig, we had so much fun.
He was one of my few viewers when I streamed games, he would almost always connect and chat with me.

I will miss him a lot, I sent him a text over instagram, that I wish he could read one more time.

I haven’t slept much the last few nights because I’m struggling with the way I’m living and I know I need to make change.

I’m 31, female, living in Surrey UK in a small house I rent. It’s super expensive rent and bills. I have two cats that I adore. I work fully remotely for a London based agency and need to go to the office a few times a months. I’m paying off a small SUV that I love. 

But I feel stuck. Every day is the same. I sit and work in my house. Even if I go to a coffee shop or something, the routine is always the same. 

I have tried meet-ups and clubs to socialise but nothing meaningful has materialised. 

I want something more from life and I know I want to travel. I want to spend less on rent too.

I have this dream of living in airbnbs in Europe from month to month. If I need to go to the office I can just fly back for the day. Or get the train or something. 

Each month that goes by, I itch more for change. 

I’m not naive. I don’t expect that travelling will fix my current problems. It might make me feel lonelier than ever. But the money saving is one thing. I know it’s cheaper to spend on accommodation that way after research. And the novelty of new places to explore may inspire me. I might find somewhere I want to stay and a community I love. And if I don’t…I can go back to the uk and rent again. At least I tried, kind of thing. 

But a few things hold me back. 

1. My cats. It doesn’t feel fair to drag them from place to place. I’m also limited by the places I can rent if I’m bringing two cats. I feel like it would be more practical to rehome them even though that would break my heart. Because they are my world.

2. My car. I love my car and it’s in a payment plan. I’m sure I could find a way to end the plan. But I’m torn between having a mode of transport - especially if I take the cats with me - and wondering if it’s too much baggage to take with me. Sure, it’d be good to also have somewhere to store my stuff. But maybe it’s better to use a storage unit for whatever I can’t sell off and travel light? 

3. My stuff. I have a lot. I’ve tried car boots and stuff is going very slowly. I have a few things I want to keep but I’m not attached to most of my junk. Just throwing it away by hiring a skip or going to the tip feels weirdly reckless and wasteful somehow. 

4. General fear. This is the smallest factor. I think if the above 3 were somehow reconciled or sorted, I would just go, honestly. I’ve had enough of how I’m currently living and need to shake things up. But it’s a drastic thing to do and so I have that whole fear of change thing.

The traffic, the over-the-top rents, the constant buzz—it all felt a bit overwhelming. Add to that the stories I’d heard about auto drivers scamming you for a 2 km ride or restaurants charging ₹300 for a coffee, and I was convinced the city was all about hustle and no heart.

But last night changed my perspective in the smallest, yet most wholesome way.

I had just dropped my friend at Sandal Soap metro station, and we managed to catch the last train heading to Majestic. After seeing him off, I was heading out when I noticed a group of people casually walking toward the metro. They seemed way too relaxed for it being the *last metro of the night*, so I couldn’t help but shout, “Brohh! YOU HAVE 2 MINUTES, HURRY UP!”

One guy turned back, looked startled for a moment, and then smiled and said, “Thanks, man!” Soon, their group was yelling at each other, “RUN, RUN, RUN!” But here’s the funny bit—they weren’t actually running or even climbing the escalator. They just stood there like they had all the time in the world.

At first, I rolled my eyes. *Typical rich kids,* I thought. *They’ll just call an Uber if they miss the train.* But as I walked away, it struck me—there’s another metro that goes the opposite direction about 30 minutes later. Maybe they were heading there.

And then I smiled. Maybe they didn’t need my “help” at all but decided to play along, just to make a random stranger (me) feel good about trying to do something nice. That moment made me pause and think about Bangalore.

Sure, the city can be frustrating with its scams, sky-high costs, and relentless traffic jams. But it’s also a place where people are unexpectedly kind and full of humor, where strangers share small, unspoken moments of connection. It’s these fleeting interactions—like the chai vendor who remembers your order, the auto driver who doesn’t try to fleece you, or a group of strangers humoring you in the middle of the night—that remind me why this city is more than its stereotypes.

Bangalore, you may be chaotic and sometimes absurd, but you’ve got heart. And last night, for me, that heart shone through in the simplest, most unexpected way.",22,1736493484.0,bangalore,2,0.92,False

In the beginning, he would constantly leave his dishes on the sink and wouldn't clean up after himself when making his pot of coffee (coffee grinds all over table and coffee spills) and the kitchen after he finishes cooking.
When the trash is full, he would just start stacking up his trash and avoids ever taking it out (The past 2 years, he probably only did it less than 6 times lol)
It got worse when they got a cat..
Unfortunately, the washer & dryer is located in their bathroom and the litter box was located there. They would never pick up the litter and it would get so bad that after getting our laundry, it deadass smelt like sht and walking in their bathroom always made my eyes water because of the ammonia it created.
They would also leave things cluttered in shared spaces.
I feel like that isn't even the worst part. I mind my business truly but I hate the way he treats my friend. My friend works 2 jobs so she comes home around 3am and goes back to work around 12pm. He would game every single day after work in his drenching uniform to where whenever they have their room open, it would just make the whole place smell like ass.. he doesn't do anything for her as in there is always a laundry basket full of clothes that are just laying there and on their bed scattered. She does the laundry and she cleans and washes his dishes. I mean what?? Not you treating your woman like THAT.

So this post got taken down yesterday before I could get any sort of advice so to speak, apart from some good advice by u/toomuchreddit101
I tried to get advice on some other subs, but I don't think a lot of advice from Western audiences translates well to me. 
I'd really appreciate some advice and tips as I (25M) and going to meet a girl (24M) on a first date on Saturday. We met in hinge and have been talking off the app, and it's been good, and I have a feeling that she likes me too, considering the fact that she's flirted on text too and seems genuinely interested, and we match on many things like political opinions, interests, opinions in general and religious beliefs. 
So I've got a few questions that I hope I can get answers for:
1. Is a coffee and walk (with a surprise show that I've planned) a good first date? I don't drink so a date over drinks didn't make sense imo. My plan was coffee and then we catch a show for an event and than have some dessert. 
2. Is it weird to travel with her in the metro to the mall we're heading to for the date? I proposed a cab but she said the metro will atleast not see the crazy traffic that drivers have to, but I feel taking her in the metro might be off-putting?
3. I'm going to be going out of country for a few months soon, found that recently and haven't spoken about this yet, she plans to move for some experience as well, so it's not like it's out of the picture, but how do I talk about this? 
4. And tips on dressing for the date? I suggested she wear comfy shoes to the mall, and she said she isn't wearing shoes on a first date, so the bar is high for me now. 
5. What's the consensus on some gifts? She's a potter head and I was gonna get this bracelet or some pendant(not overly expensive, like 300 rupees maybe), but my friend said that would be too much so stick to flowers. What would you say, flowers and a card(her bday was last week so)? 
6. Any tips additionally might be great, like the touch barrier, I can talk comfortably, but I hesitate to go in for the hug directly with a girl, so how should I navigate that, and in general. 
7. Also, she's smashing it in her career, and I'm still looking for a good position, so mentally that's there too

Our conversations have been amazing, I had issues with unsending and editing messages, and she called me out on it and said that hopefully she can get me comfy, so oddly in my head, the Guruji Ka, koi tumse pyaar kyun karega is running. 

Sorry for the long and repeat post but looking forward to the tips and responses .

1hxyn48,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hxyn48,"23M and 37F, never been happier than right now.","You guys on here fill me with hope. My bf spent 5 months coming across to my shop whilst I kinda talked to his arm instead of looking up at him. (5foot to 5ft10)I asked him out in a chance conversation because we talked about a place we both went to ""Oh we should go!"" and discovered he'd been building the courage to ask me out and just kept hurling compliments at me from the door of the shop and running into the night. I was...thick as two short planks. Him: ""okay..."" flees out the shop and then remembers to come back with his snap 10 minutes later. Me ""Take my number like a normal person"" quite like snap now though, the avatars are cute. I invited him over that night for coffee and offered a spare bed so we could chat into the night. He also got lost and I had to go get him.

 The third photo is him and my match maker, Opal. She has gone for every person who has entered our house. Walked in the door and Opal looked at him and within 5 seconds, ""Daddddddddddddy"" 

That night we were sat chatting on my bed and he said ""I've been thinking about you for 5 months and I want to marry you and have kids with you."" 
Me, ""Okay, I get divorced in November so you'll have to wait."" Him...""I did not think I would get this far""

He never made it to the spare bed, I just kinda fell in his arms and stayed there. Next day he said ""I'm going to go home, by taxi, have a shower and come back"" Me ""You're going to spend £20 on taxis to come back to me?"" (Shocked pikachu face.)

 6 weeks later I saw where he was living with his mom, it was bad, then his sister told him to move out and live with me so he can learn what bills are and because his mom will be better off. So I just said ""okay then, let's go!"" 

For context my previous relationship was with a Saudi/Indonesian of the same age. He never intended to have children with me, married me because his mother ordered us to and, at the end, said I was his ""biggest embarrassment."" 

So this, is very refreshing. He's adamant that if I said no there is no other woman he'd be with because women taught him he's ugly,  so if any of you like how he looks,  can you please send your compliments because I wake up to daily full back and leg massages these days.  I mean... if a big, burly guy had told me ""I give full body massages and I can lift you up like a princess"" I'd probably have jumped at him back in April.  He's even more handsome with no glasses,  it takes my breath away.  

He also wants the full white (ish) wedding.

We both have two kids, she recently divorced in the last 9 months, my divorce will be at the courts this week. We started communicating on the daily as well as seeing each other once or twice a week. For coffee, a date to some light show type things. In the beginning she had told me she doesn't invite people to her apartment until it's serious. No big deal. Last week I tell her about a spontaneous trip I'm taking to the city for a sandwich I've been craving. Said she's never had one and asked if she could come. When dropping her off she mentions that she thinks things are going well, equal parts good, equally flirty and that's she thought about sex but not until my divorce is finalized (our state doesn't recognize separation and she said being legally married was cheating in her eyes). I told her I respect that, she asked when mine would be and I told her this month.  She said she believes me. I walk her to her door and chat for a minute and then we kissed. She invites me over to her apartment the following Friday. Canceled because of kid reasons and she asked if I wanted to come over Monday. I go over we chat have coffee, put together a toy that she asked for help with. Later that night I tell her I slipped on ice. Asked if I'm okay, said my bum hurt. Told her that hers could probably take the impact (she's mentioned herself multiple times that she has a big butt) I then told her the pants she had on made her butt look good

She would send a good morning text if she was up before me, the next morning there wasn't one. I say it and just get hey. Asked if what I said upset her and she said it caught her off guard. I apologized. She remained standoffish the rest of the day and I left it alone until later when she got off work. She said was a busy day at work and she'd text me later. The next morning I asked her if she wanted me to stop texting her (I know, stupid), she asked why I said it seemed like something changed but maybe I'm over thinking. She said maybe yes it is best we stop for a while. Is that an indirect way of yes stop we're done and I should move on? Does she actually just want a break for a little? Do I wait indefinitely for her to reach out

ich habe eine Frage an die Kaffee-Nerds hier in Hamburg, speziell in Altona:

* Welches Wasser benutzt ihr für euren Kaffee? Nutzt ihr Leitungswasser, gefiltertes Wasser oder kauft ihr spezielles Wasser (z.B. Volvic)?
* Habt ihr schon mal die Wasserhärte bei euch gemessen? Wenn ja, wie ist sie bei euch so?
* Gibt es Empfehlungen, wie man das Wasser optimal für Kaffee anpasst? (Mineralien, pH-Wert etc.)

Für Altona ist bei mir ( [hamburgwasser](https://www.hamburgwasser.de/wasser/mein-trinkwasser) ) die Härte 6 °dH und der pH-Wert 8. Perfekt für Kaffee wäre laut [Experten](https://www.kaffeemacher.ch/blog/kaffeewasser/) :

**Filterkaffee:**

* Gesamthärte: 2 – 3 °dH
* Alkalinität: 1 – 2 °dH

**Espresso:**

1hxycgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FleetwoodMac/comments/1hxycgz/personal_ranking_of_the_albums/,PERSONAL Ranking Of The Albums,"Honestly, I am really bored so I decided to finally make this list on my opinion of the FM albums that I have wanted to make for some time now. I've been listening to FM for a couple of years now, listened to every album I don't even know how many times and every album was on repeat background music for some time as well so I feel that I've generally cemented my opinions on each one. Making this list just to see what people think and maybe hear a different perspective!

  
17. Time - Honestly don't know what to say. This album is something I don't understand at all, I don't vibe with it, 0 songs hit personally and for me this is easily the easiest thing in the world to forget. I gave it a lot of tries and even if I thought that the melody on a song was nice, next day I would completely forget it, unlike other albums that even if I didn't enjoy, I would remember melodies. Maybe sometimes in the far future I will change my mind.

16. Behind the Mask - Honestly kind of the same thing as the album above, however I few tunes I did remember and also hearing the first 5 seconds of  ""Skies the Limit"" made me laugh so much for some reason I can't explain, felt like I was on a game show and my time limit was ticking. Again, this album is not memorable for me at all, hopefully I can find some beauty in it in the future.

15. Say You Will - I think that this for me is the last album where I don't really put it together with FM, definitely better than the previous two and is also an album where I did find myself enjoying a song or two. The album is ok, it's just that the competition is so amazing that it goes in this position. Say You Will is the favorite on the album.

14. Tango in the Night - Not sure if this ranking is a surprise or not but this is where I have it. It has a lot of hits, but for whatever reason the album didn't really connect with me. I enjoy the album, a solid amount of good songs, but I never really listen to it anymore unless I haven't listened to it for a while and then I decide to play it. I always enjoy my time when I listen to it, but the other albums simply give me a better feeling when listening, I can't pinpoint the feeling I'm trying to convey. Little Lies is the favorite on the album.

13. Fleetwood Mac (1968) - For me, this is where I can really say what FM is for me. Love the style of music, feels like I should have a glass of whiskey on me while listening to it. The certain guitar part repeats itself in a few song but I really like it so I don't mind. The whole album gives me a nice vibe and brings me back a bit to when I started to really explore this amazing band. Peter Green is a magician in my eyes. Got To Move is the favorite on the album.

12. Mr. Wonderful - Similar to the previous album, the only difference for me is that I prefer the songs on this one a bit more. Peter Green is still a magician in my eyes. Lazy Poker Blues is the favorite on the album. 

11. Kiln House - This album was a nice tease into some of the best pieces of music that I would hear while on my FM journey. Danny Kirwan is amazing, the whole album is amazing, there are a few songs that I'm not super into, but overall it's a cool album. The album cover is beautiful and it's a nice transition from the Peter Green era. Station man is the favorite on the album.

10. Heroes Are Hard to Find - This is the first album that grew on me after some time. At first I didn't think much of it, but I eventually found myself singing the songs from the album while running. The vocals are something that my brain always highlights on this album, as well as that album cover that freaked me out when I first saw it. I also found that it's a nice album for Sunday mornings while making coffee, eases me into the day. Angel is the favorite on the album.

9.  Penguin - This is where I started to really get invested in FM. Bob Welch is probably my favorite band member, and while I think this is his weakest album, it is still amazing. His voice is my personal favorite and this era of FM is as well. This is the era of FM I definitely listened to the most and the one I think is the best in terms of overall enjoyment. Remember Me is the favorite on the album.

8. Fleetwood Mac (1975) - This is the Fleetwood Mac that most people are familiar with and for a very good reason, the music is straight up, pure fire. So many iconic songs that hit hard in any way you can imagine, whether you enjoy the music or the vocals or u find the lyrics resonating with you, this album has you covered. Blue Letter is the favorite on the album.

7. Mirage - This is an album that, at first, I did not like at all. Can't explain why, I simply never cared to much about it. But damn, this album grew on me like moss on a rock. This album has some of my favorite melodies, some of the best guitar and overall is my personal favorite album to play in the background while you are doing something else. Eyes of the World is such an amazing song that every time I listen to I find another detail that makes me appreciate it even more. It is also the favorite on the album.

6. Future Games - I feel that Bob Welch is so underrated when people talk about FM in general. The dude made bangers after bangers, songs that sound so complete, like they have been made with the utmost care in the world. And I will never get over his voice. It's not impressive on some technical level, but the color of the voice is what gives the songs atmospheres that I enjoy. Sometimes is the favorite on the album.

5.  Then Play On - My..... God..... I take back what I said, Peter Green is not a magician, he is an actual all-powerful being aware of things that us humans could never describe in words, so he made this album to describe it for us. Best album of that era, every single song sends me to a different universe of feelings. When I'm drunk, laying on my bed, this is what put me to perfect rest. Such beauty. When You Say is the favorite on the album.

4. Rumours - If you ask random people about FM, most likely they know songs from this album. Impressive vocal feats, catchy tunes, amazing lyrics, emotions, this album captured all the things that you would want on an album, polished them and presented them to you. It's the defining album of the FM band, and when recommend FM to anyone, this is always THE album I recommend. I Don't Want to Know is the favorite on the album.

3. Tusk - This album bring me pure joy. It so fun to listen to it, it's like an experiment that turned out amazing. The style of this album is what takes it to the top 3 for me. This album also has a very special place in my heart because I started listening to FM through ""Tusk"", a song that is referenced in JoJo. I've always wondered if that was one of the band members dog. The Ledge is the favorite on the album.

2. Mystery to Me - I think I have shown enough hints previously so that this placement doesn't come as a surprise. Emerald Eyes, Why, Hypnotized, I could go on and on about every song on this album, this is the album that got me completely hooked on this band and this album also widened my music taste. Everything falls beautifully into place in this album for me, and the album cover is funny. The only reason it is 2nd is because the last album exists. Why is the favorite on the album.

1. Bare Trees - Peak. Absolute peak. If I could only listen to one album for the rest of my life, this would be it. Perfect songs, perfect order, everything about it is perfect to me. This album follows me everywhere I go, and that's the way it will be forever (*and ever and ever*).

He speaks in riddles, mixing profound statements with nonsense. He can frequently be seen doing weird and bizarre thing, Like: 

Spending hours every night staring at the moon, talking to it like it's a sentient being. He gestures toward the sky, swearing it’s ""nodding back"" or ""flickering"" in agreement.

If he sees a cloud formation, he immediately believes it’s a message from the ""Elder Celestials."" He'll start rambling about cosmic alignments and how the clouds are ""arranging themselves to form the great prophecy.""

he often hums strange, off-key melodies that he claims are ""ancient lunar hymns"" that only he can understand. Sometimes, he’ll dramatically sing them out loud in public, expecting others to join in.

He believes that shadows are ""dark spirits"" sent to ""steal the light of the world,"" so he will often shield people from their shadows by standing in front of them, dramatically holding his arms up to ""protect them from the darkness.""

He’ll often pick random strangers and tell them that they’ve been ""chosen by the moon"" for a great mission, like picking up a cup of coffee or standing in a certain spot for five minutes. Anyone who questions it gets an elaborate cosmic explanation.

When something bothers him, Moon King will throw glitter into the air, insisting it's ""a ritual to bring the stars' blessings"" and that it will ""dispel the negative energy.""

If he sees something mundane, like a spoon or a paperclip, he’ll suddenly declare it a “celestial artifact of great power” and treat it with the utmost reverence, often performing bizarre rituals with it, like waving it around to “summon the moon’s blessing.”

He tries to cook for people but makes sandwiches with bizarre combinations of ingredients, believing that certain food items are ""charged with cosmic energy"" and will bring enlightenment to whoever eats them.

Moon King often gets into strange ""battles"" with cows. He will charge at them with his arms flailing, shouting things like, ""Back, you members of the Seventh Reich! The moon commands this land to be free!"" He'll act as if he’s in the middle of an epic struggle, often running in circles around the cows while dramatically attempting to ""defeat"" them with an invisible sword. The cows, of course, are completely unperturbed. 

The Seventh Reich is an enigmatic and mysterious concept that Moon King believes in deeply, but refuses to elaborate on.

1hxy8mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hxy8mk/aita_for_throwing_away_a_3_year_friendship_over_a/,AITA for throwing away a 3 year friendship over a cup?,"Fair warning, my lovely Reddit friends: this is going to be long. Like, 5 part tiktok with minecraft obbys in the background long. So buckle up. Also, yes I know this is about a lot more than a cup, but still.

To preface this: I am in the military, the Navy to be exact. If you've been in the navy, or worked on long haul underway boats, you know it can suck. The friend group that this pertains to are all also Navy. Myself (20F), Katy (24F), Patricia (22F), and Tom (21M).

My second preface is that I think the way we were raised has a lot to do with this situation as well. I was raised pinching pennies in rural Northeastern America, and she was raised pretty lavishly in Northwestern America. I was also raised that Bs in school had room to improve, and that leggings, sweatpants, and pajama pants were for house wear only, whereas she was raised allowed to wear whatever she felt comfortable in, and I am 100% willing to admit that I was/am envious of her for that.

Myself, Patricia, and Katy were all in boot-camp together. I left their division and continued on in another due to illness, so I didn't know them very well. When I graduated and was placed in my permanent duty station my old rack-mate reached out to tell me Katy was stationed at the same base but different command, and that she wanted my number so that we could hang out. I said sure, and received a text from Katy a few days later to ask if I wanted to hang out. I said sure, because I lived on the ship at the time and if you've ever lived on one (6 people to a 5ft wide, 6ft long cubicle (think bunk beds but instead of 2 its 3 and they face each other.)) you know that I was practically living in my car for some alone time. I picked her up from her barracks building and she asked if we could go to a coffee shop she saw on tiktok (she didn't have a car at the time). I said okay, and to put the directions on. The shop was a 45 minute drive each way. I, ever the pushover, sucked it up and endured. We would hang out a couple times a week after that, and it was always fairly normal. There was a lot of boy talk since we were both single, and there was always the comparison of our outfits. We looked so starkly different. I would wear jeans, a nice top, jewelry, and heels, and Katy would be wearing sweatpants, and sweatshirt, and crocs. She also frequently refused to take care of her hair, which was shoulder length, and would end up with matting in the back of her head that she would have a friend comb out. It wasn't like she had horrible hygiene or anything, she just didn't brush her hair. She also had a chronic issue of messing with guys. She would match with them on hinge or tinder, talk, flirt, plan a date and then bail. Or she would sext them, make plans to have them come over/go over herself, and either go but back out and just stay the night, or bail all together. I always thought this trend was risky, because frankly, men scare me. But to each their own.

Enter Tom: Tom and I match on hinge and talk for a few days, then add each other on snap and talk for two weeks. During this time, our other friend Patricia got placed at the same base, and all 3 girls started hanging out. I was terrified to meet Tom in person, but Pat and Katy planned the whole thing and made me go. He was so genuinely kind, and it is still the best decision I've made so far. He is still my best friend. After that, I started splitting my extra time equally between the two of them. Pat was about to deploy, so we didn't see much of her. So Saturdays I would spend with Katy and Sundays with Tom, and I thought everything was going well. Then came the week before Pat deployed. We all pitched in and got an Airbnb for the week so Pat didn't have to spend the week before her deployment living on the ship. We all hung out there throughout the week, but one day Katy said she was going to leave and go hang out with a boy she'd been talking to named DJ. After a few hours of their hangout, Pat and I called to make sure everything was okay. Katy answered crying, saying that DJ had stood her up and she was so cut up about it that she'd been crying in her apartments parking lot. Mind you, she and DJ aren't dating, and they've met twice - I understood completely why she was crying but this is important details for later. Anyway, Patty and I pick her up and I made dinner for everyone (Myself, Tom, Katy, Patty, and Patty's boyfriend). The following day, I felt super under the weather, so Tom decided to come and get me and bring me to buy Legos. Easy, right? Sort of. We pick out mine and his, and they one for Patty and her guy, but what about Katy? Well Katy doesn't like puzzles. No picture puzzles, no Legos, nothing that could be considered mentally challenging at all. And textures either, so no slime or anything. We're trying to be nice and find something to include her, so we end up buying a brick set for small kids that was maybe 15-25 pieces, and figure she'll be okay because I struggled so much with them, too, that she wouldn't feel behind or left out. Wrong. We go home, build our Legos, and then I decide to go and lay down for a bit because I still feel horribly. Tom follows, and we take a nap for about 1-2 hours. When we come out, Katy isn't there but Patty and Patty's boyfriend are. We ask, and they say that she got super quiet and then just left. I got super worried, and so Tom looked up her location on snapchat and told me where she was and we all started texting her. She ended up saying that her rejection from DJ earlier in the week, followed by seeing us happy, and being 'singled out' by us buying her a Lego toy made her depressed and she went to this specific spot on base to 'stargaze' (she used this as code word for idealize hurting herself.). She ended up coming back to the airbnb a while later and acting as though nothing happened.

Tom and I continue to go out and somehow, any time we're going out Katy has to be involved. If we're going shopping or to lunch, she comes long. Tom, being a classic gentleman type, never lets us pay for our meals or drinks, and she talks nonstop about how nice that is, and how good of a man he is, and so on. It never super bothered me. Then one night, just before a long underway of mine, we're going out on a date. We both dress up, we enjoy a nice dinner, and then we decide to go and walk around a bit before going back to his apartment for the night. Cue Katy all of a sudden being super sad and depressed and wanting a place to spend the night so she isn't alone. She drives out to his room and he and her (neither of which had worked much that day) stay up drinking for a good portion of the night. I, who had worked all day, fell asleep relatively early (around 10pm). The next day, and for a literal YEAR to come, she makes sure to remind me how ridiculous I looked sleeping. How messy my hair got, how I tossed and turned, how I talked to Tom in my sleep, and even makes fun of me for at some point half waking up and interrupting their conversation to ask Tom for a kiss before promptly going back to sleep. Whatever, right? She was sad. Its fine.

My deployment comes around and I have two under ways before it. I can no longer leave my car in the ships parking or it will be towed, so Katy offers for me to leave it at her lot about 1.5 miles from the pier and she will come and get me from the pier when we pull back in and drive me to it. I agree. I go on the underway and the night I return Tom is unavailable, but that's fine. It had been an long and annoying turn around, so I'm just excited to get off the boat. We pull in late, around 8pm, so we aren't ready to depart until 10pm. Right about then, Katy texts me saying that DJ is free and wants a booty call, so she is going to go there instead of grabbing me. We argue a bit about whether or not she should just grab me real quick before going, and what I can do if she doesn't and she ends it by saying that she ""has to put herself first sometimes"" and stops responding to my texts. I ended up walking to my car in the pitch black at 11pm to make sure I had it the next day before work. I'm furious, and Tom is trying his best to diffuse the situation. We don't speak for almost 2 weeks because of the whole ordeal, and then she ends up apologizing, which I accept because ending a friendship over a 20 minute walk sounded crazy. (I shoulda left it there).

I go on deployment, and it was a doozy. Tom went to a different duty station about 40 days before I deployed, which crushed me, and due to world standing we didn't hit nearly as many ports as we should have. The whole thing was missile after drone after missile after drone for 9 months straight. During that time, Tom and I agreed to be friends due to space, and I rarely had time to text or speak to family members. I was told, however, that Katy got into her first real relationship, and that she had lost her v-card to him. It was all good things about this guy until 3 months in, when she abruptly ended things. From what I know, she ended things out of nowhere, and he responded by saying some horribly mean things to her such as: He doesn't validate her feelings because her feelings aren't valid, she would make a horrible mom, and that he would file a restraining order on her if she contacted him again (Ig she had some things delivered to his house as an excuse to see him because she wanted to get back together.). This whole ordeal ends in possibly the worst thing I have ever said to a human: That if she was going to force crash her own computer, she should at least think about her friends and family in doing so, and leave nothing for anyone to have to clean up. She text me multiple times crashing out talking about ending her life, and I was very supportive and reminded her that she was loved for the first 5-7 times, but then she sent me a photo of her roommates side arm (he is a cop) with the caption ""The intrusive thoughts are getting to me"". I had been up for an ungodly amount of time because of some recent attacks and crashed out back saying something to the effect of ""If you were going to do it, you wouldn't be talking about it this much. And if you are, at least don't ruin other peoples lives in the process. You'd ruin his career, his mental health, and his home if you did that, not to mention traumatize your whole family so much."" I ended up sending a lengthy text to her brother, who told her mom and who consequently flew out two days later to come and visit to make sure she was okay. She didn't send me her ideations after that.

A few months later I returned from deployment and she started beef with my MOM. I came off the boat and she, Patty, and my mom were waiting. I couldn't find them, so I stood there awkwardly, and when she saw me, instead of pointing me out to mom (Who I'd not seen in nearly a year) she ran and jumped into my arms like an waiting wife. The whole situation was odd, and my mom was obviously a little crushed she had the joyous reunion with her daughter tainted by being the second person to hug me. The tension sucked. Katy spent the next week intruding on my mom and I in the airbnb. Literally just coming over and falling asleep on the couch, or trying to drag me out without my mom for ice cream and such. Tom came over and she kept intruding on every topic we spoke about, saying how much she and him had spoken while I was away, and just generally making the whole thing odd. I had saved up a ton of patches and buckles for him, and couldn't even tell him the backstory of one fully without her interjecting. As soon as she left that day, my mom was like ""I don't know what you see in that girl."". My sister came into town and the same deal. Katy totally injected herself into a girls night with my sister, and as soon as she left my sister was like ""She seems certifiably insane and immature."". My mom made the joke that her and Tom might be a cute couple and Tom totally crashed out literally saying ""no no no no no no no. I'd rather be lonely oh my god."" and referenced several stories I'd told him (Like her asking what type of car I own while running her finger over the literal ""Wrangler"" embellishment on the back of my Jeep.) After this, Katy started getting oddly possessive of him, though. Saying that I compare possible dates to him and such, and saying that I should just let him go (um hes my bestfriend bye).

Anyway, she recently chose orders to a new command, a ship in a different country. I told her that I didn't think she would like it because luxuries she has now don't exist at those commands. Mental health days, taking a week off without leave being taken bc of a bad breakup, showing up late without repercussions, participation awards etc etc wouldn't be tolerated. She didn't tell me at the time that it had bothered her, and I'm usually the honest person, anyway. I'd rather tell you how it is than sugar coat it. She ended up telling me that the guy she'd had a bad breakup with (ya know, the one her mom flew out to her state over because she was threatening logging off the game of life??) she had been sleeping with him without protection because she was hoping that pregnancy would get her orders cancelled. So I think we were actually on the same page about her not doing well on the ship but whatever.

Katy also spent months telling me about how much she hates Pattys boyfriend, and how horrible he is to her. Literal months of how emotionally abusive he is, how he treats her horribly, how she thinks he's cheating on her, and how I need to break them up since i'm the more confrontational friend. When I tell you this man LOVES Patty, he LOVES her. I have witnessed him build her and charcuterie crackers and feed them to her while she drives, man. If that's not love IDK what is. But Katy is convinced they're horrible for each other and need to break up.

Here's the culminating event: Her friend comes over and stays the night at my apartment with her (they wanted to drink). I did not drink, and seeing as I work nights (and had work the NEXT DAY) it wasn't exactly the best situation but I digress. I was told they'd be out by 8am so i could sleep. They didn't leave until 3pm, and her friend left her Stanley at my apartment. I figured no biggie, and text her saying she could get it from 6am-8am or 3pm-5pm any of the following two days (when I got home from work, or before I went into work). They say okay. The next day I wake up at 3pm to 12 missed called from Katy at 11am. I text her and she says they were trying to get the cup. I reiterate that I sleep from 8-3 and therefore was not awake at 11, and that she could come grab the cup at the aforementioned times. They say okay. The next day I get woken up at 2pm by more spam calls. I'm a little upset at this point, because she does this a lot and to everyone. She has no respect for anyone's time and thinks everyone should answer her right when she wants them to. She's called me about 10 times at this point, and I ignore the call just for her to start calling from someone else's number. I text her asking what, and she says her friend is trying to get the cup. I say the friend had agreed earlier that day that she was going to get it at 4:30pm. She says the friend got out of work early, and besides I ""haven't been trying very hard to get her stuff back to her anyway."" she then proceeds to tell me that if someone called her in the middle of her sleeping hours, she would pick up and give them their cup back. Girl, you couldn't even give me a 5 minute ride be so for real. I walk the cup out to her friend (who has borrowed a pair of pj pants that she didn't even have to give back to me). I text Katy saying her friend has her cup and then send her a lengthy paragraph about how I need her to respect my time and space, saying how she needs to respect that I have a different sleep/wake schedule than her, and it isn't fair of her to expect me to change it just because it inconveniences her. I also put in another thing she did a lot: Texting others to tell them to tell me to respond. If she knew I was with Tom, she would text me and then immediately text him saying ""Tell Lee to respond to me."". I wouldn't even be ignoring her, but if a text went unread for more than 30 seconds she would text my other friends to tell me to respond.

Anyway, she stopped sharing location, unfriended me on facebook, and told Patty that she's ""seriously considering if she wants to be friends with me anymore"". And I'm not going to lie, I'm not reaching out if she doesn't. I know it probably sounds petty, but I mean c'mon. Its a cup, not a plate of gold. It wasn't going anywhere. How is a cup work 30+ missed calls in the middle of my sleep, and her accusing me of being a bad friend? Also, is it petty of me to now ask for the whopping 4 things of mine she has in her room? Like, they're genuinely not my biggest concern, but considering she claims I didn't try at all to get back her friends things, should I bring up the 4+ items I've been asking for back for a YEAR and not gotten? Like she's literally walked into her apartment while I wanted in the car and promised to grab my switch dock from her closet and then come out 5 minutes later without it and been like ""oh well I'll get it back to you eventually hehe"".

Seeing a dilemma, I put a carboard box over the roaster and there was a conveniently placed cut out that allowed me to see the temperature and settings.
