( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Which would you say holds up to coffee table activities better?  Does one resist non coaster using cum rings?

Don't be like me!","**Disclaimer:** I take full ownership for cutting it too close getting to the airport, and I don't place much blame at all on the airline. I just want to post this in case it helps other travelers! Usually, I'm pretty anal about getting to the airport really early but I was feeling relaxed and not too worried. Also have pre-check and global entry which can help a lot if I have to go through US security or customs pre-flight. But yeah, I know I'm a dummy! 

**Story Time:** I was flying out of Frankfurt today after visiting friends. We took the train to Terminal 1 and didn't realize til I was on the train that I was in Terminal 2 (flying a different airline than they normally do, and I didn't know terminals were decently far apart). Got there two hours ahead of time and got a quick coffee together. Then I went to check my bag. But the train between terminals is closed, so there was a bus, which sat at Terminal 1 for at least 10 minutes before driving another 10 minutes to Terminal 2. Then I had to walk to the far end of Terminal 2 for American Airlines to check my bag, at which point I was informed that I was 7 minutes late for checking the bag since the cutoff was 75 minutes before the flight. I know some people will just go through security and then gate check their bag, but I had too many liquids. The agent was really kind about it and booked me for free on a new flight the next day, which I am very thankful for, and I have now learned my lesson!

**Lessons Learned:**

* Check transit times within the airport and within terminals even if folks who have been there before say X amount of time is plenty! 
* There are different cutoff times for checked luggage for each airline and each airport. Most international flights seem to be 60 minutes and domestic 45 minutes, but some large airports are up to 90 minutes for certain airlines.
* American Airlines will not notify you of the baggage drop deadline or tell you this in their app or in pre-flight emails. You have to go to their website manually. I think I missed it also because you are often reminded of the deadline when you add your bag in the app, but with American, you can't do that for international flights.

As for me I now have an extra day to spend time with my friends so it all worked out :) Happy travels ya'll! ",6,1764857494.0,travel,0,1.0,False

1pe0ys2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pe0ys2,"25M, finally can afford to move out","Not finished moving in, I work from home and there’s no internet in here yet so I’m moving stuff little by little on my day off. The apartment was pre-furnished (most are here) so the only furniture that’s mine is the desk in the back. I have another one that I plan on sticking in the corner and making an L desk. Gonna put shelves between the desk and the couch later on, and put up some art prints and posters once everything else is in place.

I spent years talking about putting my zines on the coffee table and I finally have one! The plushies were all in a cupboard before I moved them so I’m still figuring out what to do with them. My friends already know how I move so I’m considering keeping them there lol. The TV is old as shit and won't display my Switch so I might ask my landlady to take it away, it would have been nice but I didn't need one to begin with.

I really wanted a separate dining table so I tried to make the space work for both, but time will tell if it actually does. I would ask for suggestions but I feel like there isn't really that much to do here in terms of rearranging? There's a balcony door and AC unit behind the dining table, so not a lot of leeway there either.

All in all it’s pretty scary to be on my own, but it’s also like a massive weight came off my shoulders. And my bedroom is between the kitchen and bathroom, so no more kids yelling at my headboard through the wall \\o/",1,1764857424.0,malelivingspace,0,1.0,False

I would wake up, walk into the kitchen for coffee, and immediately feel stressed seeing the mess from last night. It started my day with a deficit.

Recently, I started forcing myself to clean everything before bed, no matter how tired I am.

Walking into a spotless kitchen at 7:00 AM, with empty counters and a shiny sink... it feels like a gift from ""Past Me"" to ""Future Me."" It sets such a peaceful tone for the day.

Does anyone else get a weird amount of dopamine from just... clean surfaces?

                             I

Another day begins and Sonny Howard wakes thinking, ‘Why did I have to be born?’

The year is 1929.  Deep in the heartland of North America, on the coast of Louisiana is a small remote island about one hundred miles from New Orleans.
Thats where he was born, and where he will die.
Never to step beyond the bog ridden boundaries of
Grimm Island…


Sonny rises each morning in his humbly quaint ramshackle cabin he and his father built many moons ago. It looked considerably more respectable then but has since become a slanted and creaking mess, for which Sonny’s neglect is totally to blame. It is perched in the marshes of Grimm Island, where the cicadas sing on a loop and the fireflies dot the humidity with amber glow and the Spanish moss droops down from the warped and sunken trees and dips its flora into the murky waters. A silver dollar moon hangs perpetually in twilight, shining bright as always.
He lies in his hammock and reaches over to his pocketwatch on his bedside barrel, snatches it up, and clicks the clasp open.
“One hour til’ bedtime, shit,” he mutters as he drowsily swings his legs out of his patchwork sling. Kicking over several jugs from last night's drinking session, sending them skittering across the littered floorboards. His head is buzzing with the ache of the grog. He stands, wobbles a decent wobble, and then goes to brew a fresh pot of Mississippi mud. In the corner of the shack lies his ever faithful one-eyed dog ‘Pete’. Who fills the place with the sound of blissful sleep. Pete’s a thin and bony thing, a mutt with a ragged black flea habitat for a coat and the face only a mother could love (imagine leprosy on all fours, that’s our Petey) but as good a friend as one could ask for.
Tossing a few scraps of last night’s blackened rat into his dish, Sonny drinks deep of his sludgy coffee and begins his morning routine…

He steps outside and onto the porch, to sync his watch up with the moon. The air is so densely humid that it nearly has him vomiting down his long johns, but the alcohol soup stays put for now. All he can see from the rickety plinth is not much of anything as a thick and boundlessly eerie fog obscures all of the marshland, but he can still hear the teeming swamplife and the lapping of the water on the banks. He looks up and sets his watch accordingly.
Satisfied he turns back and heads back into the cabin.
Pete has stirred and looks like death warmed up as per usual.
“50 minutes til’ bedtime Petey, how’s the head?” he says whilst stripping off his urine stained pyjamas and starting to wash himself half heartedly in a tin sink.
Pete makes love to every last morsel of his rat meat.
“Prolly’ make it 45 minutes boy, best be safe.”
The mut licks his jowls.
“Fog’s thick as pig shit t’night Petey, so make sure ya’ oil the lamp real good ok? But we’ll get her done. What you say you go n’ get Ol’faithful ready then lad?”
The dog knows exactly what to do, he’s been doing this since he was a pup after all.
“I reckon we don’t want no more than four o’ the regular, couple o’ small’s, and two jugs o’ shine,” Sonny says.
As Pete turns to head out the door he is halted by Sonny who encumbers him with one last order.
“Oh, and Pete…dont’.forget.the.shine.”
Pete knows exactly what to do, he’s been doing this since he was a pup…

Slipping into his denim overalls and aged lined shirt, then stepping into his brown leather boots, Sonny adorns his duster and hat then fetches his tobacco tin and a curious little bag of cloth which he stuffs into his breastpocket.
Fastening his pocketwatch to himself he steps out, not even taking a second to look back even though it could very well be the last.
Sniffing up that swamp air, still with stars in his eyes he braces himself then says “ 40 minutes til’ punching in Pete, we saddled n’ ready boy?” Pete sits like a statue on the edge of the river holding in his jaws the frayed end of a rope, the other end is tied to a battered dinghy. Its canary yellow paint is time weathered and peeling and the name ‘Ol’Faithful’ is barely legible as it reflects off the water.
“Aye laddy, makes for a fine vessel!”
Pete has already loaded it with all Sonny had requested and all they will require.
“Smart as paint you are my lad!” Sonny hives Pete’s skull a loving ruffle. Inside the rowboat, not fit to ferry a flea are two large hessian sacks, two wooden crates, an assortment of smaller boxes, a lavishly detailed Parisian oil lamp, and two jugs of moonshine with ‘XXX’ scrawled on their faces.
“Ya done good boy, and on a good a night as any, I reckon, what you think?” Sonny says.
The hound clambers into the boat and picks up the lamp in his mouth and sits himself at the bow, staring out like an unlit lighthouse waiting for Sonny.
“Yeah, guess your right, who givessa’ shit.”
Sonny joins Pete, lights the lamp hanging in the dog's maw and it shoots a cadmium beam of light across the bayou. He mans the oars and they set off on their moonlight commute.
“35 minutes Petey. Pop a cork n’ let’s get swampin’...”



                             II

Drifting downstream (already a quarter of a jug lighter) our dynamic duo are right on schedule. They always are.
Pouring out another dram of shine into his hat for Pete
“Some hooch for the pooch!” who laps it up diligently.
Glancing at his watch Sonny exhales “Right on the tick boy, we best get to loadin’.”  Sonny takes the lantern and sets it beside him, illuminating the collection of crates and sacks as Pete slurps down the last of his booze before saddling up next to him. Floating in the quiet southern breeze he cracks open a crate and pulls out a shotgun from beneath the seat. Inside the box is enough ammunition to cull a small village, the other boxes contain similar shells and bullets that will slide snuggly down the gullet of his peacemaker. He loves this part, like a kid at the soda fountain. He loads his weapon like he’s making love to a woman. Tonight is a special night, one like no other before it.
“Ya’ think Pa’ will be in high spirits t’night Petey?”
Pete slurs a sigh in response.
“Yep, you’s is right again, fuck 'em.”
As they meander down the lazy murk, under cover of the drolling moss and canopy, a rogue freshwater alligator nuzzles up against the dinghy. Spying its ridges poking out of the glassy blacktop of the stream Sonny promptly THWACKS it over its head with an oar with furious conviction. Almost splintering the paddle too heck.
He spits moonshine in its eye.
“Fuckin’ Goddamn’ Fuckin’ GATORS! GOD DAMN IT! I can’t wait for this Pete! Gone dust 'em’ down real good tonight! Send this whole fuckin’ island packin’!”
He spits at the retreating gator again.
“Yes sir! You did seen the last of Sonny n’ Pete! That you can believe!” he laughs a high pitched squeal and Pete joins in, howling at the milky orb hanging massive in the black sky.

Sloshing down another glug of hooch Sonny clacks his barrel shut. Loaded to the brink with gunpowder and hate.
Taking out his bowie knife from his ankle now he admires its edge in the moonlight. He digs his hand into the pile of bullets and brings out two orange shells from the open crate. He carves a ‘H’ into the top of each of them.
Showing them to Pete, the nickel tips glint in his eye.
“And these un’s for the pa’s.”
Mozing around the bend the two can now see the bank on which they will disembark. A sloping mound of dirt with the water clinging all around its edges, an island within an island. Crowned atop the perk land is a vast and sprawling cemetery. Showcasing rows upon rows of stones, too many to mention. Tall silhouettes of intensely morbid mausoleums, tortured tombs, stone effigies of saints and angles, and corpse piled crypts doused in slimy coats of grim death. Spindly arms of dead trees are dotted throughout the graveyard, with the signature hanging as long as ever despite its distance from the water. The whole cemetery is encircled and enclosed in a pen of wrought iron fencing, bent and black rails are spiked into the earth, and at the entrance is a great lumbering gate that stands stretching to pluck the stars. The boat surges up and sinks into the mud making a disgusiting squelch as if docking in a port of worms. Stepping out onto the mud, lantern hooked onto the end of his shotgun and Pete in tow, Sonny is slightly drunker than he ought to be and fumbles with the buttons of his jacket and lights up a hand rolled cigarette.
Pete stumbles on the spot (even drunker than he ought to be) and they trudge upwards together to the gate. Ambling up the hill, the aura of the dead place permeates the air and our heroes' bodies in turn. An essence of ancient necromancy and virulent arts is omnipresent. One might hear the tribal drumming of bones of stretched skin or the whispers of an incantation if you pressed an ear to the soil.
A plague is in the earth. The water  foams up on the banks, leaving an iridescent slick of wicked mojo as it slides up and down the clay. At the top of the hill and at the foot of the gate are a series of wooden lids embedded by footfall into the ground. Stepping stones of coffin tops. Carved into them are various illegible names, dates, and symbols.
Sonny and Pete hop across them in a giddy stupor brought about by their excessive consumption of the homebrew moonshine they’ve shared. Sonny’s breath makes his eyes water. Hiccup.  Now at the mouth of the entrance, they halt dead in their tracks. Sonny swaying slightly, flicks the peak of his hat back up above his eyes which he then runs all over the frame like he’s undressing it.
“Welp, looks locked up tighter than sister Francis’s bloomers Petey. Guess we ain’t welcome hiccup here.” he chuckles as he tugs on the padlocked chain tied around the gate.
“Yes, sir I do declare this Son’a Bitch tied up like bootlace.”
He takes a last monstrous swig of shine. It dribbles down his chin and all over his shirt as Pete watches wagging.
He reaches under his shirt collar and pulls out a twine necklace of his own making that has a large anemic brass key tied on it. Tarnished a fountain green and bearing the emblem of a ‘H’ he drops it at his feet dramatically.
“Well, shit the bed! Looksee here Peter! Someone been real friendly like and gone done left us a key, now ain't that thoughtful.” they both erupt into a chorus of maniacal drunken laughter. Full of vigor and joy he picks the key from the sludge and works the lock, doing a little jig as he does so. Pete copies him. With a loud metallic CLUNK the chain is cast to the earth and the gate is sent screaming open. Petes pads on in as he’s done every night before but is pulled gently back to heel by his tail.
“Not t’night boy. You gettin’ the night off. This one is my cross to bear, and besides, I don’t much like the idea of knowing you might be spendin’ your last night on Grimm workin’ the cem. It just don’t sit right with me.”
Pete looks lovingly puzzled at Sonny with his cloudy eye.
“You just plant yourself here and keep that eye fixed on Ol’faithful there and I’ll be back soon enough and then we’ll be outta’ here, for good. I swears it to ya boy.”
Sonny winks at Pete who winks back. He bends down, ruffles his head, and pours out a little dish of shine for him “Lil more gooch for the best darn pooch this side of the Miss.” Sonny straightens up and shoes the alcohol of his senses, takes a few deep breaths in rapid succession, and raises his gun letting the lantern beam its light out into the cemetery. Clicks back the hammer and steps in. Pete sits and watches as his figure is swallowed in a blanket of swamp mist.

                            III

Whistlin’ a melancholy tune Sonny walks slowly underneath a canopy of dead things. The buzzing of the fireflies and chirping of the cicadas provide a false atmosphere of serenity. A stretching field of crumbling graves pushes the limit of his vision. Scattered and clustered, not plotted with a shred of respect for the countless occupants, not that Sonny cares. For as long as he can remember he’s hated the dead. Had to bear the burden of the cemetery whether he wanted to or not. A job, hereditary slavery, a role in the universe, spectral honor, whatever you might call it, Sonny sees it as a curse, plain as day. His father Leonard Howrad did not share this sentiment. No in fact dear Leonard had done his best to raise Sonny to respect his work, and that it fell to them to carry out this ‘divine’ task as he had called it.
“Remember son, this is a job of the utmost importance we have here.” he had told him “For as long as there’s a Howrard on Grimm Island it’s our mission to see it done, with respect and civility.”
A disillusioned old fuck Sonny always thought.
“Your great greatgrand-pappy Homer came here to New Orleans to seek his fortune, and in a way, I suppose he did.”
What he told the young Sonny next would shape his existence.
“He found love you see, a love of the most dangerous kind. He soon fell victim to a messy love triangle of burning jealousy with the priestess Madame Louveux at its center.
Louveux had emigrated from Tortuga in the Carribbean. She was a surreal and beautiful creature and many a man fell for her charms, and many men went mad with a painful lust. But Homer…Homer Howard was the first one that drove her mad with a lust all of her own. A feeling she was not accustomed to so it’s told. So you see when Homer set in motion a series of…complications. Louveux grew to loathe him the way only evil lovers do and as a result of what came the Howard lineage plays out here, on Grimm Island. Tasked to make peace despite the peace our family stole. Until the end.”
Fuck. That.
Sonny remembers what his dad had told him then as if it was yesterday, he also remembers what he had asked him.
“Until the end pa? When is the end?”
Leonard never saw fit to answer that one and died ‘making peace’ some six years later…

                            IV

Sonny has reached the heart of the cemetery where a large stoic bandstand stands in the middle with branching dirt patches attached that shoot off in every direction like spokes on a wheel that lead to every part of the cem.
Almost time to make the rounds. Sonny checks his watch instinctively “5 mins! Shit!” Time has gotten away from him somehow and he quickly picks up his feet and trots down the eastern path as a wave of sobriety crashes over him. He will need his wits sharp as a tack if tonight is to go as planned. If tonight is to be the last.
Sonny can see his destination now, he stops at a sorry looking grave. The same grave he does every night.
Mr.Jenkins always wakes first, Sonny never figured why.
He grits his teeth with disdain as he stands astride the plot, facing the headstone which he stubs out his cigarette on.
Pocketwatch in one hand, shotgun in the other, pointed down towards the dirt he counts.
“2 minutes to bed.”
A bead of sweat rolls down  his ashen face and drips off the end of his nose onto the grave.
“1 minute you fuck.”
The hanging lantern swings in the breeze.
His watch reads 2 am and that very instant a foul smell wafts up punching Sonny in the eye and a rotting corpse named Jenkins bursts up out of the dirt. Spraying mud and maggots all over Sonny’s overalls. As the dripping mess pops to an upright position, still seated in his box, he lands with his mouth gaping directly onto the barrel of Sonny’s perfectly positioned shotgun. As if Jenkins’s head was on a chartered course for hellfire.
“G’night Wyatt.” 
Click goes the trigger and the festering skull is blown all over its own headstone.
Watching the stinking chum slide down the granite, Sonny spits a maggot out from his lips and lights another cigarette as the headless Mr.Jenkins slumps back into his grave, smoke billowing from the tip of his peeking spine that juts out from his ravaged neckline.
“What  a bonehead ey Pete? HA!” he chuckles to himself as he looks for Pete’s howling approval of his wit.
He forgets that his companion isn't with him.
He’s glad about that the more he thinks.
Sonny empties his firearm and throws the two smoking shells into a pile of casings already amassed at the base of Mr.Jenkins’s headstone, and walks on as he pumps his arm full again with doses of gunpowder.

The next stop is the Leclere brothers. They will just be rising right about now. Sonny fantasizes about how he will dispatch them this time as he nears closer to their restless place. Not more than 20 feet away, the first of the brothers stands awake and swaying like driftwood in the thicket.
The other is still being birthed up from the ground.
“Howdy-doody ya’ pig squealin’ bastards!” Sonny announces as he lifts the gaze of his gun to meet the eyes of the staggering brother.
“Hope you ain’t sick of the taste o’ lead!”
The Leclere brothers were shot to death in 1892 for…unsavory acts upon children.
The first blighted body lunges towards Sonny who has his shot primed and ready, targeted right where the deadman’s nose ought to be but drops it at the last second and click.  He blows him out of his boots, leaving them standing on the ground with his shin bones sticking out. Sonny gets a sick pleasure from watching the legless corpse skid back through the grass like a skipping stone.
Brother Deux is now up and ready for action. He is considerably more fat and rancid and is on our man all too quick. Sonny supposes he’s earned the impending struggle as penance for playing with his food.
The second brother bowls him over to the ground, knocking the shotgun loose and out of reach. The decomposed diagram of a man stands over him full of weeping holes, poised to chomp down on Sonny but he gets back on his feet quickly. He snatches up the body by the tattered remains of his lapels and hosts him overhead with a guttural grunt of exertion. Standing like Atlas Sonny brings the brother down violently over his knee, and with a sickly satisfied smirk Leclere Deux is cracked like an egg, and his dusted stinking entrails spill out. The grotesque jigsaw of the men squirm and screech amongst their own offal and gray flesh and begin to claw his way back to Sonny’s feet
(legs n’ all!) Sonny yawns dramatically “I'm getting real bored of the likes of you’.” he spits on the ground and checks his watch casually as he slips another cigarette between his lips. The limbs and torso’s creep closer.
“Welp, fraid’ I ain’t gone be able to get creative on ya t’night boys.” he sparks his cigarette and fills his hand once again.
“Got’s me a meeting with the family, and I can't be dilly-dallying with you two daisypushers!”
The pillaged top half of one of them has dragged himself right to Sonny and is mouthing on his boot leather. Sonny glares down at him with glowing venom.
“G’night fuckers.” and crushes his head underneath his boot, sending his eye rocketing across the grass like a cork.
The other is briskly obliterated in a flurry of thunderous enfilade.

                            V

It seems time is slipping away faster than he had noticed, a byproduct of the shine Sonny deduces. (Correctly)
Soon they will be coming thick and fast.
The rotten hoard.
A parasitic swarm of infernal decay. An undead corral that roams aimlessly in a carnivorous pack.
A rabble of pests in Sonny’s eyes and nothing more.
They will be cut down without mercy all the same.
Although he won't be taking the time tonight to cull the herd completely, despite how much he hates them. 
This view of detest wasn't always Sonny’s, in fact for the first year or two as a very small boy and still under the tutelage of his father, he had fallen for the rhetoric of bullshit he was spoonfed from the cradle.
Hook, line, and sinker.
Taught to ‘lay them to rest so they might find their way back to god’. The Howards had always done it this way, all the way back to great grandpappy Homer, but Sonny knew better. He would lay them to waste before peace.
There was no god.
His existence was a disease.
After a few years, he was totally abstract to Leonard and his forefather's insane traditions and saw his life for what it was. Futile and endless. Born to bury the dead.
The same cadavers, the same time, the same place, until he keels over and joins them; where some poor sod will come along and do the same to him.
This does not suit Sonny.
He wants off Grimm Island and to see its twitching remnants sunk to the bottom of Ol’miss.


Releasing oneself from the loop of his namesake has proven difficult at best. For years now Sonny has tried countless methods  of escalating madness.
Perhaps he needs to burn them all?
So he and Pete burned every single corpse in a single evening on a moonshine bonfire.
They returned charred the next evening.
Perhaps pulverized into a stinking fleshy pulp?
But the work was too strenuous to be carried out in a single night.
Without their heads?
That theory was quickly dismissed as many residents were already topless upon burial.
Sonny has tried every type of dismemberment and foul destruction a drunken mind can fathom. Recited every word, from every creed, in every tongue he knew but alas, nothing. Hope was in harrowingly short supply and he found respite in his cruel dismissal of the dead in a drunken stupor. This is how he happened to fall piss drunk into an unmarked grave one night about three months ago. 
As he lay there covered in soil, the stars spinning above, he unearthed various old tomes buried into the walls of the grave.
Many moon-drunk nights followed, pouring over the texts, referencing and cross-referencing. Hoping to cleve a scrap of knowledge that will lead him to escape.
He believes he has found it…


                            VI

Sonny walks deeper into the cold beating heart of the cemetery. Illuminating his way through the humid fog with his lantern. Decimating any wandering reanimated that stray into his path. The beam of his light casts long shadows on the tombs that lurk at every turn. Some he cannot identify the names of the inhabitants as they have been eroded by the waves of time, but others are recent enough for him to attach a name to; which makes it even easier for Sonny to establish a connection of hatred for them, like Madame Morrel for instance, whose plot is coming up next on the tour.

Sonny’s face is bathed in the plume of smoke from his cigarette as he leans a shoulder up against a pillar of the Morrel tomb and presses an ear to the iron door, and listens to the detestable wailing coming from within.
“Mornin’ Beatrice, how ya’ feelin’ today?” he chimes sarcastically and false as ever.
He enjoys messing the Madame Morrell.
The response comes in the form of dripping wet groans.
“Ya’ don’t say! Well, I never!” Sonny reaches for the knocker on the door, ready to open it.
“We’ll whats says you to coming on out here and letting Ol’Sonny takes a gander at ya’? I got’s what's good for what ails ya Beatrice.”
Squeezing the walnut stock of his shotgun, he begins to heave the door open. In the opening crack, fingers of rotted gray flesh poke out and scratch the air.
“Madame Morrell, would you permit me this dance?”
As the door is swung open, Sonny jumps back ten paces to put distance himself and the inflated stinking blob that is emerging. Beatrice lurches out of her pit, the size of a bull and bloated to match with reeking morbid gases. Patches of deathly pale blue skin hang down like ripped fabric exposing maggot infested flesh beneath. Her face is so swollen it tears under tension and the odor of decay pouring from this billowing mass could peel an oak.
“My, Madame Morrell, have you lost weight?” he quips but doesn't have a moment to appreciate his own wit; as the festering landslide called Beatrice throws her enormous weight at him. Bowling him over like a pin, she writhes all over him. Leaking juices and worms that drip onto Sonny’s face.
She bites, scratches, and howls.
“Woah! Let’s take it slow t’night baby!” Sonny summons his strength and pushes Beatrice up off his chest leaving just enough space for him to make a desperate reach for his knife. The insatiable contorting wrecking ball atop him proves to make it a struggle, but this isn’t Sonny’s first rodeo. He produces the knife from his ankle eventually and turns the tide of the struggle as he plunges it into the bowed out gut of the lady.
She gargles out a screech as Sonny now grips the handle of the blade with both hands and drives it upwards so deep that his hands' journey inside the cold wet cavity of her bowels. He now begins to rip her from navel to nose.
Icy hot reems of black eels come raining down in a flood. Coiling up in a tangle on Sonny’s body. 
Reaping his way through the bruise blue noxious flesh and ashy bone he cleves through her palette. Separating each side of her face to opposite banishment. Through septum and tooth and by the time the task is finished and she has been pushed off him to one side, the ravaged body is pooling in a thick horror.
From belly to temple, she is totally separated. Held together by staining threads of taught sinew. On each side of her face, her eyes still twitch and look about for Sonny.
He takes his knife to them with delight.
Barely having enough time to wipe himself down he hears it. An ominous rumbling of a hundred undead cattle.
The rotten hoard.
“Thanks for the dance toots’.” Sonny tips his hat to the disemboweled Madame still wriggling and runs onwards choosing to let her be trampled under the hooves of the hoard rather than waste shot or time,  the latter of which he is running out of. 
So onward it is, to the final stop…



                            VII

Typically Sonny spends each night returning each specter into their earthly bonds, but tonight he is all too eager to test his new theory; which if you will recall if proven to be effective will award him with release from everything he hates. He is deathly confident about this new theory, but apprehension is never too far from discovery as history has proven time and time again. If he is to fail, if it doesn’t work, he will turn the barrel upon himself.
That he knows for certain.
He pants like a ragged beast as he canters on, but all too soon the hoard is upon him. Intercepting him just shy of his destination. The largest mausoleum in the whole cemetery. Grand and gothic in every detail, with traditional Parisian flairs flecked throughout with artistic flourish. The hoard is across from him, moving in  an unsettling rhythm. A destructive ball of dancing corpses. Sonny flicks his cigarette into the cacophonous swarm, lowers his shoulder, and charges in.
Peeling away at them like a fieldhand at work, he hacks and blasts his way and leaves an allotment of bodies in his wake.
Limb, flesh, and bone are flung up into the air like foodstuff bubbling out over an uncovered pot.
Sonny uses his knife with such animalistic fury and surgicality by the time he has reached the entrance of the grand tomb; he is scrambling over a littering mound of reeking parts and is doused in a lather of putrid dippings.
Squirming and squelching in the mud, the cloud of powder and blood thins, and the numbers of the hoard can be counted. Still, way too many to deal with right now. He’s only cut down about a quarter of the mass and they are not his priority and he also needs to reload desperately.
So the cogs turn quickly and he dashes for the gate that leads down into the grand tomb.
The name ‘Howard’ is etched into the archway above.
Flinging the rusting gate open he steps inside the stone hovel and turns to close up the gate behind him, but sees something he wishes he hadn’t.
Clambering over the quivering corpses, weaving through the hoard.
“PETE! WHAT IN THE FUCK YOU DOIN’ BOY!?”
Pete is galloping through the valley of the hacked and split, navigating the swarm with a nimble panic.
Sonny sees that Pete is clutching a scrap of something in his jaws.
“GET THE FUCK IN HERE RIGHT FUCKIN’ YA CRAZY DAMN DOG! NOW!”
Pete comes barreling in and anchors himself to his master's leg as Sonny locks up the gate…

“JEEZUS BOY! You was nearly ripe for gumbo! What in tarnation you get to thinkin’ to go do something like that YA FUCKIN’ LOON!”
Pete lowers his head as he receives his telling off.
“Ya’ don’t let that shine go to your head, Peter! You know what could happen t’night! YOU got’s a problem man, and 
I’ll Fix ya come hell or high water!” he stoops down and looks the hound dead in the eye.
“You’re a damn drunk Pete.”
Silence divides them for a moment and Sonny sighs, in either exhaustion or defeat Pete cannot tell but now is when he drops the gnarled scrap he has been carrying in his mouth at Sonny’s feet. He picks it up and examines it.
A scrap of yellow timber. He turns it over in hand.
‘Ol’fai– -’ is all he can read.
Their dinghy. Reduced to a splinter. Torn apart by the hoard, or more likely an alligator come back for revenge after a thwack on the noggin’.
“Fuckin’, gators.” he sighs. Now ashamed he realizes he was wrong to berate his best friend like he did.
“I'm sorry boy, you done good Petey, ya done good.”
Sonny kneels and embraces the old booze hound.
“I’m glad you is here, though I wish you weren't. Ya know what I mean?” Pete winks at him and Sonny ruffles that bony little skull of his and stands back up.
Together again, our heroes begin their descent down the stone steps into the bowels of the Howard tomb.
“I was only kiddin’ bout’ ya being a drunk boy.”
Pete barks back playfully and it echos down into the darkness…

                            VIII

The muted taps of bootheel and paw tinkle down the stretching tunnel staircase. Damp, slimy, green stone and lichen entombing them. Sonny creeps slowly deeper with Pete in tow. Running his free hand along the wet contours of the wall until his hand drops into a void and the ground levels out beneath them. The space opens up and they are now in the main chamber. Sonny fumbles his hand along the wall until he feels the brazier he knows is there. He lights it and a cigarette simultaneously. The crypt is tossed abruptly aglow in the dull flickering amber and reveals the contents of the crypt. Lined up across the entire length of the hall is a sporadic assortment of stone coffins. Fourteen in total and all in varying stages of age and condition but all have been constructed with impeccable craftsmanship.
Elaborate yet understated, beautifully ornate yet sinisterly horrific. Their lids are shuffling in place as the trapped bodies bang and claw within, trying as they might their withered rotting muscles simply don’t have the strength to free themselves. Our two cursed companions stroll through the little underground graveyard of stirring dead, reading out the names etched into them aloud as they pass.
“Lewis…Andrew…Winslow…Bruce…Daphne.”
Sonny never knew any of these people but felt pity for them all the same, because just like himself they were enslaved to Grimm Island and the Howard name.
Sonny walks up to the penultimate grave tucked near the back. It’s visibly the most recent and he knows every detail, he ought to, he built it.
He taps the barrel of his gunmetal on its slick gray top.
“Knock, knock, Leonard.”
The lid shakes with rising intensity like an undead engine.
“We reckon we’re done Pa’, we reckon we had enough of this fuckin’ hole.”
Pete tethers himself to Sonny’s leg.
“Nuff’ of the worms n’ the maggots!”
He loads a shell marked ‘H’.
“You said it was an honor putin’ em’ fuckers back in the dirt. Whadda load a horseshit!”
Pete untethers himself slightly as Sonny’s tone shifts.
“But look at you now pa’! Squirming in ya own guts!
Well, no more dustin’ for us! No more Howards!”
KLAK KLAK
The barrel snaps shut and he begins to slide the stone lid open with his bootheel.
“It’s a DAMN CURSE n’ you knew it! And STILL, ya brought us here to this FUCKIN’ SWAMP!”
The lid slides.
“ON THIS GOD-DAMN-FUCKIN’-ISLAND!” venom flies out of the seething Sonny and his voice begins to break.
“WELL, How’s THIS for rest in peace LEONARD!”
Screaming and breaking, the whole chamber is stirred up into a frenzy and the coffins buzz as they are riled up.
The lid falls open and immediately the sorry decomposing body of Leonard HOwrd is sat bolt upright in his grave.
“G’NIGHT PA’ FUCK YOU!”
Sonny rams the barrel under the chin with such brutal force and enthusiasm it almost comes out the top of his father's rotten head before pulling the trigger.
Dear Dad can only sound a morbid wail before the top of the pulpy cranium is obliterated. A thick soupy spray of goop and bone spatters all over. Father slumps back into his grave as black malodorous juices trickle out of the jagged opening that is his thinking dome. Mouth gaping and a lacerated waggling tongue on display. Sonny falls to the floor and stares into a space beyond space, far removed from him, the crypt, and Pete who sits across from him. The pair are soaked in the night's horror, chucks of stringy flesh, mud, blood, bone, entrails, and the escent to match. Sonny’s eyes are burned into his face like swirling pools of jet black fire. He begins to laugh. And then laugh harder. Harder.
Soon the whole family crypt is brimming with the sound of insanity. Rattling coffins, the aroma of seeping guts, hysterical laughter. The toom seems to spin, the madness thickens as the light seemingly strobes. His laughter fastly becoming a deranged level of ludacris maniacal bewilderment. Pete joins in nervously, unsure if Sonny has cracked or not. The unhinged laughter turns to terror and then morphs into a desperate wailing of tears and mortal frustration. Sonny screams in the black.
Woof, definitely cracked.
Then silence.
Spinning and screaming cease/ as the unraveling sanity grinds to a halt, Sonny is catapulted back to reality.
Pete sits across opposite him looking radically baffled and lets out a cautious, soft bark.
“I’m alright boy, lost my cool there eh? I just - thing is, if this don’t work…” he gulps. “I don't got the fiber in me ya know?” Pete rubs his wirey coat up against Sonny’s dirt sodden face.
“Oh, Petey boy, what would a swamp rat like me be without ya?”
Pete winks his cloudy eye and they embrace.
“You're right again, as always. It’s gone work, it has to.”
Sonny reaches into his pocket and takes out the other shell marked with an ‘H’ and the tiny brown cloth bag from the cabin that’s tied off with twine. He pries off the top of the shell with his knife and pours out the powder and shot onto the floor, then tips in the contents of the little brown bag, uttering some words as he does so.
Weeks of study and labor pour out.
The last hope of ending the Howard curse. Glittering purple powder trickles into the bullet casing.
“Voodoo done started this shit, voodoo gone end it.”
He had learned from the ancient books he found how to 
(he thinks) imbue an object  with voodoo essence.
Countless hours of preparation and the materials required will not be found again. It was now or never.
As he pours the funky powder out, it radiates an ethereal violet and swirling wisps of neon green. The orange casing of the shell transforms in his hand and takes on the colorful characteristics of the voodoo powder. He caps it off and loads it into his gun.
“Welp, here goes nothin’,” he says shakily to Pete with glassy confidence. He walks to the furthest coffin, clearly the oldest. This one’s lid moves almost imperceptibly to the naked eye. He pushes it wide open.
“Great great grandpappy Homer.” the barely moving old bones of his grandfather are laid out in an outline of humanity and jiggling in place like litter on a breeze. The skull rocking in place with a macabre swing.
“Look at ya’” he spits into the grave and aims his gun.
“This is all down to you, you gave this to us,” he speaks calmly, too calmly and Pete backs away slowly.
This is it.
“Well, who do?""
 Klak Klak
 ""VOODOO!”
An iridescent explosion of purple and green voodoo is unloaded in a click. The bones of Homer disintegrate into neat piles. The tomb starts to shake vigorously, rubble comes tumbling down, and bodies from above come with it. It’s as if the earth itself is being kicked across the cosmos. Mojo fog fills the casket and spills out over the sides and keeps coming. Sonny is waist deep in a sea of violet and emerald. He whisks Pete up into his arms leaving his gun and lantern.
“Let’s get the FUCK outta’ here! We ain't dyin’ here!”
They bolt out and up the stairs as the Howard mausoleum caves in behind them. Reaching the top of the stairs Sonny kicks the gate so hard, that it flies right off its rusting hinges. The crypt crumbles to nothing quicker than they can appreciate. Outside there is a vortex of otherworldly color moving where the night sky once was.

Lightning cracks and tombstones rocket up into the air like they are being fired from cannons. Sonny sprints back along the paths, all the way back to the riverbank, evading the enclosing cataclysm by the skin of his teeth. The dead are dying in the tens. Ground splitting open. He finally finds the water and the dinghy, or what’s left of it…

He has completely forgotten that it has been sent to the depths.
“Fuckin’...gators…”

They collapse into the mud and sit staring at the chaos. Their world on fire. Pete slinks unnoticed as Sonny struggles to find the words to describe what he is seeing. The whole cemetery is being pulled and dismantled into the pits of Grimm Island and doesn’t show any signs of slowing. It will reach them soon.
Pete returns with a jug of moonshine and drops it into Sonny’s lap.
“HA! Atta’ boy Petey!” he strokes his hound lovingly as he pulls the cork out with his teeth.
“Ya done good Petey.”
He pours out some into his hat for Pete and lights a cigarette, then puts an arm around his friend.
“Ya done good boy.”

They sit and watch the beautiful apocalypse until the ground finally swallows them up...

What I have found so far:

Healthkart Bgreen and Nakpro Pea+Rice protein: Using Sucralose and Artificial Flavours. A big no!

Cosmix: Too much chalky and earthy as per reviews, and quite expensive for a plant protein, as per my research.

Origin and Oziva: Way too expensive, also not many authentic reviews and lab test videos available on youtube. All of them are just paid videos. 

Naturaltein: way too many ingredients, unflavoured version is not available. But I can consider it as third option as it has natural ingredients.

At the end I have found these two, Yogabar and Superyou. Yogabar is using natural ingredients and even unflavoured one is available. Superyou also seems like a good option for being more gut friendly.

**A.A. is more than a set of principles; it is a society of alcoholics in action. We must carry the message, else we ourselves can wither and those who haven't been given the truth may die.**

**AS BILL SEES IT, p. 13**

I desperately wanted to live, but if I was to succeed, I had to become active in our God-given program. I joined what became my group, where I opened the hall, made coffee, and cleaned up. I had been sober about three months when an oldtimer told me I was doing Twelfth-Step work. What a satisfying realization that was! I felt I was really accomplishing something. God had given me a second chance, A.A. had shown me the way, and these gifts were not only free—they were also priceless! Now the joy of seeing newcomers grow reminds me of where I have come from, where I am now, and the limitless possibilities that lie ahead. I need to attend meetings because they recharge my batteries so that I have light when it's needed. I'm still a beginner in service work, but already I am receiving more than I'm giving. I can't keep it unless I give it away. I am responsible when another reaches out for help. I want to be there—sober.

1pe0p85,https://i.redd.it/2ip5r5l7175g1.jpeg,What’s an unexpected fact about your country?,"Germanys ground is completely riddled with unexploded bombs due to WW2 and it’s part of our day to day life to be evacuated from places because of that. 

Yearly about 5000 bombs are found in the ground and it’s estimated that there’s still about 100 000 tons of explosives (about 500 000 bombs) in the ground. 

My city was one of the most bombed cities in the entirety of Germany during the Second World War and it’s a very frequent occurrence that parts of the city are evacuated and blocked off for a couple of hours because once again, another bomb was found during a construction or dig or whatever. It’s just part of your life here. I myself have been evacuated multiple times because bombs were found in my neighborhood, so you just go out for a coffee and wait for them to defuse it or cause a controlled explosion if defusing isn’t possible. 

Germany is almost completely mine free at this point but there’s still some areas you might come across that have warning signs that it used to be a mine field and it’s dangerous to cross. 

I feel like for a country that’s mainly seen as very modern it can be quite unexpected for people to hear about how bombs from the Second World War are still something that affects our daily life. ",4,1764856746.0,AskTheWorld,11,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

Running a café is all about speed, accuracy, and customer experience. A slow POS hurts all three. A smart POS does the opposite. It speeds up orders. It reduces mistakes. It increases daily revenue.

Today, 73 percent of cafés use digital POS systems to manage orders, payments, and inventory. Cafés that upgrade their POS report up to 18 percent higher order value within six months.

This guide breaks down the **8 best cafe and coffee shop POS systems** based on real café needs. You will also see which system fits your business model best.

Let us start with what truly matters.

# Key Features Every Café POS Must Have

Not every POS suits a café. Coffee shops need speed, flexibility, and ingredient control.

Here are the features that separate a café POS from a basic billing system:

• Fast order entry for rush hour  
• Easy modifiers for size, milk type, and toppings  
• Real-time inventory tracking  
• Support for takeaway and dine-in  
• Digital payments and mobile wallets  
• Sales reports and peak hour tracking  
• Customer history and loyalty support  
• Offline order mode for internet failures

**Action Step:**  
List your five most common order issues. Choose a POS that directly solves those problems.

**^(8 Powerful POS Systems Every Café and Coffee Shop Should Know)**

# 1. Square for Restaurants

Best for cafés that sell both food and retail products

Square for Restaurants remains one of the most widely adopted café POS systems in the world. It works especially well for cafés that sell both prepared food and packaged retail items like coffee beans, mugs, and bakery goods. Setup takes only a few hours, and most cafés can go live on the same day.

Square simplifies front-counter operations. Baristas can add modifiers like extra shots, milk types, and flavor syrups in seconds. The system syncs sales with inventory in real time. It also handles mobile wallets, cards, and contactless payments smoothly.

Square processes millions of café transactions daily across multiple countries. It works best for espresso bars, bakeries, and hybrid café retail stores that need speed without system complexity.

Key strengths  
• Simple tablet-based setup  
• Built-in card and mobile payment processing  
• Inventory for food and retail in one system  
• Staff roles and shift permissions  
• Digital receipts and tip management

Square becomes expensive when cafés expand. Advanced analytics, payroll, and loyalty features cost extra. Multi-location reporting also requires higher plans.

Action Step  
Choose Square if you want a fast launch with minimal setup and simple daily billing.

# 2. Foodiv

Best all-in-one POS for growing cafés and coffee chains

Foodiv works as a complete café management platform, not only a billing system. It connects POS, table orders, online delivery, kitchen flow, inventory, and customers into one centralized dashboard. This removes the need for using multiple tools.

Foodiv supports both dine-in and takeaway cafés. Baristas get fast order screens. Kitchen teams receive instant tickets. Managers track sales and stock live from any device. Online orders flow directly into the same POS without manual entry.

Cafés using unified platforms like Foodiv report up to 30 percent fewer order errors and 22 percent faster service during peak hours. This directly improves customer retention and daily revenue.

Foodiv suits cafés that plan to scale or operate multiple outlets. It also fits brands focused on online orders, cloud kitchens, and repeat customers.

Key strengths  
• POS and online ordering in one system  
• Café-friendly order modifiers  
• Real-time ingredient and stock tracking  
• Support for cloud kitchen and dine-in  
• Built-in customer database and loyalty tools  
• Multi-outlet business management

Foodiv works best when cafés want long-term growth instead of just basic billing.

Action Step  
Choose Foodiv if you want one platform to manage ordering, service, inventory, and customers together.

# 3. POS Cafe

Best for cafés with strong retail sales

POS Cafe is designed for cafés that run a retail-heavy model. It focuses deeply on inventory, barcode scanning, and stock movement. This makes it useful for cafés that sell packaged coffee, merchandise, bakery goods, and takeaway items at scale.

The system manages large SKU lists. It tracks stock across multiple counters or stores. Café managers can also create supplier purchase orders directly from low-stock alerts.

Many café owners choose POS Cafe when retail sales become equal to or higher than beverage sales.

Key strengths  
• Advanced inventory and stock control  
• Barcode labeling and scanning  
• Custom drink and food modifiers  
• Multi-store stock synchronization  
• Supplier and purchase order tracking

The interface feels more retail-oriented than café-oriented. Some baristas may need training to adapt quickly.

Action Step  
Choose POS Cafe if retail sales drive a major part of your café revenue.

# 4. eatOS

Best for high-volume and self-service cafés

eatOS is built for speed and automation. It supports kiosk ordering, staff POS screens, kitchen displays, and digital menus inside one connected system. This reduces counter queues and manual errors.

High-traffic cafés in malls, airports, colleges, and food courts benefit most from eatOS. Customers can place self-service orders while staff focus on preparation.

Self-ordering can reduce wait time by up to 40 percent during rush hours. It also increases average order value through smart upselling.

Key strengths  
• Self-service ordering kiosks  
• Mobile and cloud POS access  
• Kitchen display system integration  
• Staff shift and task scheduling  
• Multi-location performance analytics

eatOS requires higher upfront investment due to kiosk hardware and system setup.

Action Step  
Choose eatOS if customer speed, automation, and queue reduction are critical for your café.

# 5. Clover POS

Best for hardware flexibility and custom apps

Clover combines physical POS terminals with cloud software. Cafés that prefer traditional countertop screens often choose Clover for its durability and ease of use.

The system supports third-party apps for loyalty programs, reporting, marketing, and payroll. Cafés can customize their POS features through the Clover App Market.

Clover works well for cafés that prioritize in-store payments and physical counters.

Key strengths  
• Multiple hardware device options  
• App marketplace for extended features  
• Inventory and category management  
• Contactless and mobile payments  
• Staff access control and permissions

Add-on apps increase the monthly cost over time. Customization comes with additional fees.

Action Step  
Choose Clover if you want physical POS hardware with expandable software features.

# 6. Focus POS

Best for ingredient-heavy cafés and complex menus

Focus POS specializes in deep inventory and ingredient-level tracking. It records raw material usage like coffee beans, milk, syrups, and bakery ingredients with every order.

This system benefits cafés that closely track food cost and wastage. Operators using ingredient-level tracking reduce waste by up to 17 percent.

Focus POS also supports beverage recipes, production costing, and supplier management for better margin control.

Key strengths  
• Ingredient-level inventory control  
• Beverage recipe and costing tools  
• Production and wastage tracking reports  
• Quick service and counter POS screens  
• Supplier and purchase management

The interface focuses more on operations than visual design.

Action Step  
Choose Focus POS if food cost control and wastage reduction matter most.

# 7. TouchBistro

Best for multi-location café brands

TouchBistro runs on iPads and supports both single cafés and growing coffee chains. It offers centralized menu management, cloud backups, and location-wise performance tracking.

Multi-branch cafés use TouchBistro to analyze sales trends across cities. Managers compare outlet performance from one dashboard.

The system also supports staff scheduling and menu engineering features for better profitability.

Key strengths  
• Multi-location performance reporting  
• Cloud data backups  
• Menu engineering and pricing tools  
• Staff scheduling management  
• Customer behavior insights

Monthly subscription increases as outlets grow. Hardware also adds to setup cost.

Action Step  
Choose TouchBistro if you operate or plan to operate multiple café locations.

# 8. Loyverse POS

Best free POS system for small cafés

Loyverse offers a free entry-level POS solution for cafés with limited budgets. It works on smartphones and tablets without expensive hardware.

Small cafés, coffee carts, pop-up stores, and startups use Loyverse to handle basic billing and sales tracking. It supports modifiers, customer profiles, and simple reports.

Key strengths  
• Free core POS software  
• Drink modifiers and product variants  
• Daily sales dashboards  
• Basic customer loyalty features  
• Mobile app-based operation

Loyverse lacks advanced inventory, kitchen display, and multi-store tools.

Action Step  
Choose Loyverse if you need a zero-cost POS to start operations quickly.

# How to Choose the Right Café POS for Your Business

Every café operates in its own way. Some rely on fast counter service. Others handle online orders all day. Some focus on coffee only. Others sell food, desserts, and retail items. Because of this, the “best” POS system is not the same for every café.

A POS should match how your café actually works, not how a software company describes it. When the POS fits your workflow, staff move faster, mistakes drop, and service improves naturally.

Before you make a decision, step back and evaluate your real operations.

Ask yourself these questions carefully:

• Do most of your orders happen at the counter, on tables, or online  
• Do you sell only beverages or also retail items like beans, mugs, and bakery products  
• How complex is your menu with sizes, flavors, and custom add-ons  
• Do you run one café or manage multiple locations  
• Do you track ingredient usage by recipe or only finished products  
• Which payment methods do your customers use most often  
• How stable is your daily internet connection  
• Do you need loyalty programs and customer history  
• Do you plan to expand in the next 12 to 24 months  
• Do you need offline billing during network failures

These answers shape everything. A small takeaway café needs speed and low cost. A chain café needs reporting, control, and scalability. A cloud kitchen café needs online order integration. A retail-heavy café needs strong inventory tools.

Your POS must support today’s workload and tomorrow’s growth. If it cannot scale with you, it becomes a hidden limitation.

Also look beyond features. Evaluate real usage. Ask vendors about uptime, support speed, onboarding training, and long-term cost. Many cafés fail to consider these until after problems begin.

A short demo never shows daily pressure. Always test real scenarios.

Action Step  
Shortlist two POS systems that match your workflows. Book live demos. Run real café orders during the demo. Test rush-hour speed before making any commitment.

# Final Thoughts

A POS is not just a cash register. It controls your speed. It protects your margins. It shapes your customer experience.

The best café POS system is the one that fits how your café actually runs. Not how software brochures describe it.

If you want simplicity, Square and Loyverse work well.  
If you want retail depth, POS Cafe fits.  
If you want automation, eatOS leads.  
If you want ingredient control, Focus POS helps.  
If you want physical terminals, Clover works.  
If you want chain-level management, TouchBistro fits.  
If you want one complete café business system, **Foodiv stands out**.

**Final Action:**  
Start with your busiest shift. Choose the POS that handles that hour flawlessly. Everything else becomes easier after that.",1,1764856507.0,u_archanainani,0,1.0,False

Trigger warning for SA later in the post. It’s labeled for anyone who just wants to skip that part.
I feel as though I’m the opposite of PIMO, I'm physically out but mentally stuck in the church and what it’s taught me. 
The word “sinner” haunts me everyday, like no matter how hard I trying and deny that I am one my mind steps in to reminds me exactly why I am. I know for many of you on this forum it’s a sort of rite of passage, something you’ve reclaimed because of its absurdity.  I don’t know how to begin deconstruction, I honestly don’t know to be a real person sometimes. I’ve struggled with self harm behaviors for years (I know many of you will point out the hotline. I am aware of its existence and Im in therapy) I’ve even contemplated suicide and my only reason for not doing so is my fear of Hell. 
(The SA part if anyone wants to skip)
When I was 8, may family moved from Lehi UT to where I live currently in northern UT, to live with my grandparents. They are super Mormon and despite me, my mom, and my brother all rarely going to church, my grandparents made it their mission to make us active members. So I went to church, every week to young women’s (once I was old enough) and seminary in high school. 
I got with the wrong crowd. People I believed were nice Mormon members that couldn’t possibly hurt me. 7th grade is when it started, I’ll spare you all the details, mainly because I’m not sure I want to relive it myself. Almost every day for two years I was assaulted and violated by members of the church. Not everyone was a part of the church; the majority was. (Most were my age or a few years older, nothing PDFile related) all under 18, still gross. Other girls in the ward were hurt too, I believe most of them are married now and still in the church last time I checked. I remember praying every goddamn night that they would be forgiven by God, that maybe, if God could forgive, then they might stop hurting me and those around me. 
I vaguely remember saying something to a bishop I had, and he basically blamed me and said I was “soliciting that kind of behavior” and I believed him. He was a bishop, a good, kind man that was called upon by God’s most trusted followers to guide our ward. All lies. 
I tried so hard to remain faithful. To live by their standards even after we moved again and I was free of ever seeing those that hurt me again. I didn’t drink coffee. Repented when I swore. Even prayed to ask God to give me the “trial” of SA again so that I could prove I was a good faithful servant of God. 
They fucked with me so much, and still to this day I can’t decide whether it’s the church I hate more, or myself for being so stupid not to see their lies sooner. 
(And now back to your regular story time)
Im 18 now, on my way to college (thankfully not BYU) and still struggling to fully accept the realities of what the church did to me. I like to laugh on this sub and read people’s stories and questions because I they truly helped me begin to unfurl all the pain I’ve hidden for so long. I want someone to say that it’s okay to feel how I feel, to congratulate me on how far I’ve come. I need validation before my mind reverts back to believing the terrible things I’ve been taught. I need reminding that coffee is just a drink, and sex is normal and can be healthy.
Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated, I hope you all have a great day/or night. 
If you think this should go somewhere else or with a different tag I’ll take it down and make it again. I needed to vent and if this isn’t the sub for it I’ll go.

Yesterday was my first day back on set since my sleeve, and I was worried because I have to rely on catering and there are seventy million snacks to choose from. I did pretty ok during the day, but at night there was avalanche danger in the canyon we were shooting in, so we all had to stay the night in a ski lodge. 

The only thing on the menu I could potentially have for dinner was the soup. Everything else was either steaks or pasta or carb bombs. 

I ate like 1/2 of the soup, way more than I should have. It was 17°f and I was tired and warming myself up. I proceeded to have the worst night’s sleep ever. I woke up several times with awful baby barfs and horrible stomach acid. I didn’t know I’d be spending the night in a lodge, so I didn’t have any antacids!! 

I am shooting another full day today in the canyon with avalanche danger and sub-freezing temperatures, but my biggest struggle is definitely being so thirsty and cold and not being able to chug coffee 😭",4,1764856249.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

Main issue I see is grind assist not adjusting in line with the strength. I do double espresso on strength 3 and recommended grind 18 and happy with it but when I changed strength to 1 grind changed to 11 after brew. So when I changed to strength 3 afterwards it remained at 11 and I knew it would mess my next espresso and it did. It recommended 18 next but that's espresso wasted. Should it not adapt grind to various strengths? It knows strengths determines ratio. It can't be ok to waste espresso every time between strengths. ,1,1764855897.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,2,1.0,False

Taste is not a huge concern for me, I'm just paranoid of all the artificial stuff even if it is under safe limits.
What I have found so far:

Healthkart Bgreen and Nakpro Pea+Rice protein: Using Sucralose and Artificial Flavours. A big no!

Cosmix: Too much chalky and earthy as per reviews, and quute expensive for a plant protein, as per my research.

Origin and Oziva: Way too expensive, also not many authentic reviews and lab test videos available on youtube. All of them are just paid videos. 

Naturaltein: way too many ingredients, unflavoured version is not available. 

At the end I have found these two, Yogabar and Superyou. Yogabar is using natural ingredients and even unflavoured one is available. Superyou also seems like a good option for being more gut friendly.

I (F23 Black) am in a interracial and age gap relationship with (M40 White). Obviously cause we are in two categories of not normal relationship and live in a pretty racist town making friends for me is difficult especially cause I have moved to this new town. 

Obviously my bf has made a few so I tried to be friends with them so we could do couple things you know. Before introducing me he makes them aware that I am younger and a different race to him (he’s cut out numerous friends for making racist remarks about me or in general cause he knows I won’t hold my tongue and just respect for our relationship) 

So eventually he introduced me to his best female friend (let’s call her Melissa) and her partner (let’s call him Mark) we have a great day out 4X4 and they showed me beautiful spots around our area. 

(This is where i think I messed up) so I love making videos since I was a kid. Not for anyone else but me or for the people I love just to capture moments. My bf knows this about me but obviously these new people don’t and honestly I do remember telling them too but we were far from sober at that stage. I would like to say though only 1 video actually had them in it for 5sec in a scan I took of the view. (I’m very cautious as I hate being filmed unknowingly and believe everyone has a right to privacy)So I can see that as a red flag on my end. 

Anyway our afternoon ended we went home and the next day my bf comes to me and goes Melissa has asked you not to post any of those videos as they were using the company car and can’t be seen doing that.  Obviously I understood and  I only posted a pic of my bf and I from the whole experience on my instagram.  It was never my intention to post those vids cause half of them I’m laughing like a hyena and the other half came out blurry/ can’t see much from the 4X4 rocking the phone. 

After that we got busy with life and hadn’t seen them in a while but recently life’s calmed down and I reached out to see if they’d love to join celebrate my bf birthday with us as I was throwing a surprise party for him and I know he would love to see them. She politely declined as she had family drama going on. Since hearing it I said take your time breathe we always here for her. I proceeded to check in every once in a while to see if she’s ok and if she wants to just get out to breathe for a while which she again politely declines (no problem family first I get it). After that response she doesn’t respond. 

One evening I get a missed call at 9pm let’s say but my phone goes on DnD after 8 automatically so my partner and I can have time together with no distractions. So the next day when I see I missed her call I call straight away and text her. “Is everything alright” she says she just wanted to come over last night and then ghosts me again. 

After that I’m spooked as I’ve gone through abusive relationships and my mind just jumped to something wrong was happening. Which I then told my bf like get the spare bed ready we may have her staying over yet she never responded. So I thought cool she’s fine now and I was overreacting. 

So fast forward a month we haven’t spoken, nothing and I message her again “hey do you want to go for coffee, I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages and I know (my partner) would love to see you too” which she responded “sorry I can’t today.” So I tried to see if we could reschedule to another day then she said “I would love to but Mark is super stubborn” so I said “then let’s forget the men and go for coffee ourselves” now at this point I’ve been rejected by friends enough in life to pick up where this is going. She responds with “sorry I can’t Mark doesn’t want me too” at that point I was like she’s allowing a man to decide her friends and without thinking messaged my bf that it sucks cause I don’t know what’s happening but I’m getting blown off and I don’t know what I did wrong now. So he decides to send her a message being like ‘hey like what’s going on my gf saying this like if you don’t want to be friends just say so and we can move on.’ Which she responded “it’s not me it’s Mark. He doesn’t want me being friends with her” so I was taken  aback obviously cried as when we were together it was finally like I made true friends and was excited cause they were interested in similar stuff to us and accepted our relationship. So he sent 
me a message to block her and forget about it. 

Now another three weeks gone by and this past Sunday we were sitting on our patio I’m hungover from girls night the night before (I met two friends at “work”) and we live on a pretty busy street we have people hooting and waving up all the time from the road but this time I focused and saw it was Mark. He turned the car around and Melissa was there two. They shouted up for us to open our gate and let them in. 

They come up and acted like nothing has happened. I don’t like confrontation but more than that I despise fakeness if you going to say you going to stop being my friend then why you in my home? But they then ask if we want to go for drinks to which my bf said I’m hungover but ended up saying yes. It ended up being a average two hours as they kept ordering more drinks prolonging my hungover. 

The whole time I was waiting, wondering and hoping for some sort of acknowledgment or conversation on why I am a problem so I could clear up if it was the fact I was taking those videos if so explain why and apologise if it made them uncomfortable and ensure those videos are long gone. As the time went nothing happened. 

During our time together my bf asked about their December plans to which I cringed because I feel as though it is disrespectful to me to even continue a friendship with people or person who clearly doesn’t like me. 

Another thing that didn’t sit well with me is that (sorry more background but it’s relevant I promise) before I met my bf he and Melissa were close they were both going through tough times and turned to each other and created this special bond (to me it’s a beautiful friendship I don’t have a problem that she’s another woman) and during this time her vehicle had issues and my bf working in that field fixed, built and paid for it’s repair out of his pocket. She got it back good as new with custom parts. Now one of the first “stories” they shared with us after coming into our home was that her vehicle had parts stolen from it and wires cut. So a small part of me is wondering whether they were trying to get my bf to help out like he did for free like the last time. Also during our time they also expressed their excitement that in gambling on Friday he won a massive lump sum of money. So now if they have the money why aren’t they saying they going to a place to get it fixed? Keep in mind they never directly asked my bf to fix it but brought it up multiple times that made me feel as though trying to ask him indirectly to help them. 

As I think that another memory came to mind. At the drinks they barely spoke to us or asked us any questions regarding ourselves. They mostly spoke to each other. They were also “pretending to be Karen’s” and complain about the wait time for our drinks and actually got up to go to the bar to ask the waiter if she can get it herself. They spoke to 3 different wait staff to rush our drinks. Which to me is major red flag as being kind to everyone until they prove otherwise is my default response so seeing disrespect towards other people even in a “joking” manner I don’t find funny. They blamed being high on an edible. Now don’t get me wrong weed makes you loopy I am a stoner myself and so is my partner and we have smoke lots before they came and on our way to the place so we were high too and been high a lot but nothing that’s made us act this way. (We go to the same dispensary to get our stock) 

Now I need advice if I asking my bf to cut ties with these people cause they truly make me question their motives for even wanting to be friends in the first place. ",0,1764855612.0,Advice,2,0.5,False

If you're like most people I knowespecially in today’s hyper-distracted post-Instagram worldyou’ve likely wondered: Why do some people effortlessly become magnetic while others fade into the background?

This isn’t about looks or status. It’s how they use subtle psychological behaviors that hook attention and build irresistible presence. Think charisma, not clout. I kept seeing viral posts on TikTok and IG that glorify manipulative “dark psychology” tacticsmost of which are either pseudoscience or emotionally toxic. So I dug into legit, research-backed strategies from neuroscience, social psych, behavioral economics, and influence science.

Here’s a no-BS breakdown of 8 powerful psychology tricks to make people lowkey obsessed with you (in the healthiest, non-creepy way possible).

1. Use the “mirroring effect” (but make it subconscious)  

One of the oldest and most effective rapport-building behaviors. When you subtly mirror someone’s body language, tone of voice, or energy level, their brain unconsciously registers you as “familiar” and trustworthy. Don’t overdo it. Too obvious feels mocking. Done right, it feels like emotional syncing.  

Psychologist Tanya Chartrand from Duke University found that mirroring increases empathy and connection. They literally called it the “Chameleon Effect”. You seem more likable, and people open up more.

2. Say their nameoften and early  

Dale Carnegie wasn’t lying. Hearing your own name lights up areas of the brain associated with identity and reward (source: fMRI study from the Institute of Psychiatry, London).  

Use someone’s name within the first 30 seconds of meeting them. Sprinkle it naturally through conversation. The effect? They feel seen. Heard. And psychologically safer around you.

3. Nail the “Ben Franklin effect”  

Want someone to like you more? Ask them for a small favor.  

Weird, right? But according to cognitive dissonance theory, when someone does a kind thing for you, their brain needs to justify it. So instead of thinking “I helped them,” they start thinking, “I must like them.”  

Benjamin Franklin used this to win over political enemies. It still works.

4. Use “deep listening” (but don’t perform empathy)  

People can tell when you’re fake listening. Real listening means: eye contact that doesn’t drift, actual curiosity, and pausing before you reply. Add reflective statements like “So what you're saying is…”  

Dr. Carl Rogers, founder of humanistic psychology, argued that ‘unconditional positive regard’ and attuned listening are among the most healing forces in any human interaction.  

Bonus: this makes you unforgettable in a crowd of low-attention talkers.

5. Trigger the “pratfall effect”  

Confidence with a dash of vulnerability is one of the most powerful social attractors. Social psychologist Elliot Aronson found that highly competent people actually become more likable when they make small mistakes (spilling coffee, forgetting a name, etc.).  

Why? It makes them human. Relatable. Not intimidating.  

But there’s a lineif you present as clumsy or incompetent before trust is built, it backfires. Use this after you’ve shown value.

6. Create inside jokes and shared language fast  

The moment you and someone create a “we” momenta shared word, memory, or inside referenceit builds tribal bonding. Psychologically, this creates an in-group bias.  

When you can say “Remember that time…” or “That’s such a you thing,” you shift from stranger to co-conspirator.  

As Nicholas Epley, author of “Mindwise,” describes, people crave being understood. Private jokes hack directly into that need.

7. Master light touch (but only when appropriate)  

Subtle, socially-safe physical touch (a tap on the arm, shoulder touch in greeting) boosts bonding and cooperation.  

One study published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior showed that light touches increased tips by servers and compliance in social settings. Touch activates the vagus nerve and oxytocin release.  

But read the room. If you’re not sure if it’s safe, don’t. Consent > strategy.

8. Leave them wanting more  

Ever notice how shows end with cliffhangers? Humans are wired to want closure. If you end conversations on a slight emotional highright before it fully peakspeople are more likely to ruminate on it later.  

This is the “Zeigarnik Effect.” Unfinished experiences stick longer in memory. Walk away while the mood is still rising, not dipping. They’ll keep thinking about you later.

If you want to go deeper into this, here are some insanely good resources that break these ideas down even more:

1. BOOK: ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer  

Written by a former FBI behavior analyst, this book gives ridiculously useful insights into human attraction, trust triggers, and influence. Real field-tested tactics, not theory. One of the best reads ever for understanding the psychology of social magnetism.

2. BOOK: ""Captivate"" by Vanessa Van Edwards  

Best-selling behavioral investigator who blends social science with tactical tools. This book made me rethink HOW I show up in every social setting. Honestly, wildly practical. Think charisma decoded into playbook form. Loved the concrete examples and new science.

3. PODCAST: Hidden Brain (especially episodes like “Just Sex” and “The Secret to Making Friends”)  

Shankar Vedantam interviews top psych researchers and storytellers. Every episode tackles why people tickwithout the fluff. It’s research-based and deeply insightful without sounding like a TED Talk junkie.

4. PODCAST: The Art of Charm  

Not a cringe pickup podcast, but a behavioral science show on likability, influence, and emotional intelligence. Great episodes on body language, non-verbal signals, and rapport training.

5. YOUTUBE: Charisma on Command  

Huge channel with deep dives into social cues, celebrity charisma breakdowns (like how Ryan Reynolds hooks people), and practical confidence hacks. The psychology is surprisingly legit.

6. APP: Remente  

This is more than a mood trackerit’s a full-on life optimization app. It lets you track social goals, build emotional habits, and improve interpersonal skills with science-based micro-learning and journaling.

7. APP: BeFreed  

An AI-powered learning app built by former Google engineers and Columbia University researchers. It transforms top books, expert interviews, and research papers into personalized audio lessons based on your goalslike improving social intelligence or communication.  

I’ve been using it to study social dynamics and persuasion in podcast-style deep dives (you can pick from 10-min summaries or 40-min rich breakdowns). You can even ask questions mid-episode or chat with your avatar “Freedia” to get custom book recs.  

I’ve replaced a lot of my doomscrolling with BeFreed and my brain just works betterless fog, more clarity, and I’ve been communicating way more effectively.

8. APP: How We Feel  

Built by scientists at Yale’s emotion lab. Helps you track emotional states, decode difficult social cues, and improve emotional literacy. Daily use helps raise EQ dramatically.

People don’t become obsessed with you because you try to be liked. They become obsessed because you make them feel deeply seen, safe, excited, and subtly challenged.

Use psychology, not performance.

I was recently put on Vyvanse after getting officially diagnosed with ADHD and at the same time am taking Wegovy for food noise control and weight loss. I have confirmed that I'm alright to take both at the same time, but I am experiencing the appetite-limiting effects of the Vyvanse and am finding it difficult to eat a sufficiently varied and nutritious diet. Theoretically, I know how to add the things I'm missing. Practically, I almost solely bare the burden of figuring out how to make cheaper food that suits my household's needs and desires, increasingly dislike meat, even with the stimulant have little energy or motivation left for food making at the end of the day, and find myself stuck in my food fixations du jour. It's far from the biggest issue I've ever had but it is so frustrating. I am in comparative bliss being free from needing to eat for stimulation, focus, emotional regulation, and God knows what else, but - with the exception of my dinner - for the last week my day has more or less consisted of a boiled egg, honey-sweetened weetbix and bran slop, and coffee, perhaps a single small chocolate or some pistachio ice cream as an end-of-the-day treat. Clearly in the absence of what I have been accustomed to as food motivation, I am falling back on the easy, quick, comfortable and texturally safe. I know that a lot of us do eat limited diets like this, but I also know that it's not healthy in the long run, I'm struggling particularly hard with getting even half of my daily protein in and I'm feeling guilt (?) about it. There have been times where the foods I'm fixating on would help make up for this to some degree (I cycle through phases of liking chobani yoghurt with nuts, for example, or a particular Korean tofu recipe) but it's just sucking really hard right now and I feel at a loss.",1,1764855347.0,AutisticWithADHD,1,1.0,False

\*

It was a Thursday morning, and Sylvia and I were passed out after a long night of partying. Zack had picked up a fat 8-ball the previous afternoon, and we had plenty of liquor and beer—everything except ice. Zack and I had gone out to the Kid's grocery and restaurant to grab some.

By the time we stumbled back into the apartment, Sylvia was half-asleep at one end of the giant U-shaped sectional, one leg dangling off. The baby was in his crib in the corner of the room snoring softly under this funny dinosaur blanket he refused to sleep without. Completely oblivious to the chaos around him, as if parental irresponsibility was just another ambient household sound, like the fridge humming. I thought about Trainspotting and thanked god we were not heroin addicts.

Looking back now, I should have noticed how still he was. How the apartment seemed to hold its breath around that crib.

Zack burst in first, triumphant, shaking a bag of ice over his head like it was the Olympic torch. ""Mission accomplished!"" he yelled, immediately tripping over Sylvia's shoe and nearly face-planting onto the carpet. The man had all the energy of a golden retriever.

Sylvia cracked one eye open. ""Did you… seriously yell? With Cullen sleeping?"" she muttered, pointing vaguely in the crib's direction before rolling over with the grace of a tranquilized seal.

I tossed the ice into the sink, grabbed a beer that was already questionably warm, and flopped down next to her. ""Relax. That kid could sleep through a nuclear test,"" I said. Which was true. Last week someone dropped a full bottle of vodka on the tile, and the kid didn't even twitch. Little king of serenity :) The kid was a champ, sleeping through the kind of noise that would've had the neighbors calling the cops if we weren't in a building full of people just like us.

Or maybe he was trying to tell us something. Maybe that unnatural stillness was a warning we were too fucked up to read.

Meanwhile Zack was already setting up the drinks, trying to resurrect the party like a necromancer with poor judgment. ""Guys, c'mon,"" he said. ""It's still practically morning. We've got momentum!""

Momentum. Right. As if gravity and regret weren't already doing their best work on us. As if something wasn't already pulling us down, down into whatever waited at the bottom.

But he was smiling that ridiculous smile of his, the one that said yeah it's stupid, but wouldn't it be stupid together? And honestly? On that kind of afternoon, in that mess of a living room with a tiny dinosaur-cloaked toddler snoring away like a saint—yeah. Why not.

\*

Zack cracked open a fresh beer and poured shots of bourbon over ice. ""To momentum,"" he said, raising it like a toast to nothing in particular. Sylvia groaned but reached for her glass anyway as I handed it to her. The ice clinked against the sides, already melting, already losing the fight against the heat of the room, our heat.

The baby stirred—just a little shift, a sigh—but stayed under. I watched the rise and fall of the dinosaur blanket, the way it moved with his tiny breaths, and felt something twist in my chest. How could such a lovely thing come from Sylvia and me? But then Zack turned up the music, some bass-heavy track that vibrated through the floorboards, and the moment passed. Sylvia laughed at something—maybe a joke, maybe nothing—and suddenly, it was just another one of these afternoons again.

Except the light in the apartment seemed different. Thicker somehow. Like we were all moving through amber.

\*

Zack was cutting lines on the coffee table again, his hands steady despite everything. Sylvia leaned over, her hair falling into her face, and did one without hesitation.

I did a line. Then another. The room got brighter, sharper, the edges of everything too defined, like someone had turned up the contrast. Zack was talking about some conspiracy—something about the water, the government, the way they were all out to get us. Sylvia was nodding along, but her eyes were glazed, already halfway to wherever the coke was taking her. I could feel the sweat prickling at the back of my neck, the beer and the powder and the heat of the day all mixing together into something thick and electric.

That's when I heard it. A sound from the walls. Not the pipes, not the neighbors—something else. Like scratching. Like something trying to get in. *Or out*.

""You hear that?"" I said.

Zack paused mid-sentence. ""Hear what?""

""That... scratching sound.""

Sylvia laughed, but it sounded wrong. Hollow. ""It's just the building, babe. Old pipes. You're paranoid.""

Maybe I was. The coke did that sometimes. Made you hear things that weren't there. Made you feel like the walls were listening in..

\*

Around 2 PM, Zack decided he needed to ""organize the situation."" This involved him standing in the middle of the living room, hands on hips, surveying the apartment like a general assessing a battlefield.

""You know what this place needs?"" he announced to no one in particular. ""Feng shui.""

Sylvia, still draped across the couch like a discarded scarf, didn't even open her eyes. ""Zack. Please shut up.""

But Zack was already in motion, picking up empty beer cans and arranging them in a careful line along the windowsill. ""No, no, listen—I read about this. Energy flow. Chi. We've got *blocked chi* in here, and that's why we feel like shit.""

""We feel like shit because we've been awake for hours doing blow,"" I said, watching him with growing fascination and horror.

He ignored me completely, now trying to move the coffee table three inches to the left. Except he was still holding a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, so he was essentially just hip-checking the furniture while everything on top of it rattled precariously.

""The baby's corner—see, that's good. That's the *prosperity corner*. Very auspicious."" He nodded sagely, ash from his cigarette dropping onto the carpet.

Then he stopped. Stared at the crib. His face went pale.

""Where's his head?""

""What?"" Sylvia sat up.

""I can't... I can't see his head. Under the blanket. Where's—""

And then Cullen shifted. Just slightly. The dinosaur blanket moved, and we could see the shape of his little face again, peaceful in sleep.

Zack laughed nervously. ""Jesus. Thought he'd... never mind. Fucking coke paranoia.""

But his hands were shaking when he picked up his beer. And I noticed—we all noticed—how he didn't look at the crib again after that.

I should have checked on Cullen then. Should have walked over and made sure he was okay. But I didn't. I just sat there, heart pounding, telling myself it was nothing.

""But this couch?"" Zack continued, voice too loud, too forced. ""Facing the wrong direction. Totally wrong. We're basically *inviting* bad vibes.""

""Zack,"" Sylvia growled, ""if you try to move this couch with me on it, I will *personally* block your chi with my fists.""

He paused, considered this, then pivoted. ""Fine. Plan B. We rearrange the *spiritual* energy with positive affirmations."" He cleared his throat ceremonially. ""I am a *beacon* of good decisions!""

The baby chose that exact moment to let out a small fart in his sleep—loud enough that we all heard it.

The silence that followed was profound.

Zack pointed at the crib, eyes wide. ""Even Cullen knows that's bullshit.""

I nearly choked on my beer. Sylvia actually laughed—a real one, the kind that shook her shoulders. And Zack, completely unbothered, just shrugged and took another sip. ""Okay, fine. Feng shui cancelled. But I still think the coffee table should move.""

The moment passed. The tension broke. But something lingered in the air. Something that felt like watching.

\*

By the time the 8-ball was just a memory and some residue on the coffee table, we were all grinding our teeth and blinking too much. The sun was barely starting its slow climb outside, that awful pre-dawn gray that made everything look like a crime scene.

And doesn't that feel prophetic now? Crime scene lighting. As if the universe was trying to warn us what was coming.

Zack was pacing near the window, jaw working overtime, occasionally pulling back the blinds to peek out like he was expecting someone. ""What time is it? Feels late. Or early. Is it early?""

""It's past 5 AM,"" Sylvia said flatly from the couch. She'd been staring at the ceiling like it held answers. ""Guys, we need some sleep. Cullen's gonna be up in like three hours.""

The baby. Right. Feeding time. Bath time. All those things that required being a functional human being, which none of us currently were.

I rubbed my face, feeling the electric buzz still crackling under my skin. ""We're not sleeping like this.""

Zack stopped pacing and snapped his fingers—actually snapped them, like he'd just solved cold fusion. ""I think I got Xanax. In my jacket. Oh yeah almost forgot about those fuckers.""

""Thank god,"" Sylvia breathed. Salvation.

He dug through the pockets of his denim jacket, which was all crumpled on the floor near the door, and produced a little orange prescription bottle. Shook it like a maraca. ""My cousin's. Well, *was* my cousin's. He doesn't need 'em anymore.""

The way he said it made my skin crawl. But I didn't ask. We never asked about things like that.

Zack dumped a few pills into his palm, squinting at them in the dim light. ""Okay, so... half a bar each? Maybe a full one for you, Sylv, you're bigger—""

""Just give me the damn thing, Zack.""

He distributed them like a very unreliable pharmacist, and we all washed them down with whatever liquid was closest—beer, flat Coke, something that might've been orange juice once upon a time but now was brown (bourb'orange?). I swallowed mine and waited for the glory to descend.

Zack flopped into the armchair, limbs everywhere, looking like a marionette with cut strings. ""Okay. Okay, we just... wait for the landing gear to deploy."" He closed his eyes, then opened one. ""How long does it take?""

""Twenty minutes, maybe,"" I said, though honestly I had no idea, but it sounded about right.

""Twenty minutes,"" he repeated, like he was trying to convince himself. Then, after a pause: ""You think Cullen's gonna know? Like, when he wakes up... you think he can *tell* we've been up all night?""

Sylvia snorted softly. ""He's two years old, Zack. He doesn't know anything except tiny dinosaurs and mashed bananas.""

""Right. Right, yeah."" Another pause. His voice dropped to almost a whisper. ""But what if he's, like... *perceptive*? What if he knows what we are?""

The question hung in the air like smoke. Nobody answered it. What could we say? That we were good people? That we were trying our best?

We all knew what we were.

""Go to sleep, Zack.""

""I'm trying!""

The apartment settled into an uneasy quiet. Just the hum of the refrigerator, someone's car alarm going off three blocks away, the occasional creak of the building itself. I could feel the Xanax starting to creep in at the edges—softening things, pulling the volume down on the anxiety, the jittery heartbeat, the sense that my skin was too tight.

But as I started to drift, I heard it again. That scratching. Closer this time. Coming from somewhere inside the apartment.

I tried to open my eyes. Tried to check on it. But the Xanax had its hooks in me now, dragging me down into the dark.

Zack's voice came again, quieter this time, almost drowsy. ""You guys ever think about... if it is... like... what we're doing?""

Nobody answered. Sylvia's breathing had already gone slow and deep. I was halfway there myself, sinking into the couch cushions like they were quicksand, and honestly? It felt good. The chemicals finally balancing out, the crash pad catching us before we hit concrete.

Cullen made a small sound from his crib—just a sleepy little grunt—and I cracked an eye open to check. Still under. Still dreaming whatever baby dreams he had, probably nothing more complicated than colors and warmth and milk.

I closed the blinds, plunging the room back into darkness.

""We'll figure it out in the morning,"" I mumbled to Zack, but he was already snoring.

That was the last thing I remember before the drugs took me completely. The last moment before everything changed.

I wish I'd stayed awake. I wish I'd checked on Cullen one more time. I wish I'd done so many fucking things differently.

\*

The Xanax had me down deep, buried in that thick, dreamless muck. But somewhere in the dark, I was dreaming. Or remembering. Or seeing something that hadn't happened yet.

Water. I was underwater. Cullen was there too, reaching up toward me with his little hands, but I couldn't move. Couldn't swim. Couldn't breathe. And he was sinking, sinking down into the dark, and I could only watch—

I woke up needing to piss. Or shit. Something. Both. My body was making demands through the fog, slow and insistent, like someone knocking on a door three rooms and a half away.

The living room was dark. Completely dark. What time was it? The quality of the darkness felt wrong—too thick, too quiet. I tried to sit up and my head swam, everything moving in stages. Slow. So heavy.

Couch empty.

That thought took a long time to form. To become real. Sylvia wasn't there. The shape of the couch where she'd been—just cushions now. Flat. *No one*.

Zack's chair. Also empty.

My brain tried to process this but kept slipping, like trying to grip something covered in oil. But something felt off. The apartment had a weird quality to it, like the air pressure had changed. Like something changed while I slept.

I stood up—too fast—and had to catch myself on the arm of the couch. The room tilted. Righted itself. Tilted again. Floor solid under my feet eventually. Good. Walking now. One foot. Then the other.

Bedroom door was half open. Light coming through—that gray morning light that seeped through the broken blinds, striped and cold.

I pushed the door wider.

Sylvia was in the bed. Under the covers. I could see her hair spread across the pillow, dark against white. Still in her clothes, I thought. Jeans. Her shirt. She hadn't even bothered to change.

And Zack.

Zack was next to her. On top of the sheets. Naked. Completely naked, sprawled out like he'd been dropped from a height, one arm across his face, mouth open.

My brain stuttered trying to make sense of this. Why was Zack naked? Why were they in bed together? And why did I care? I didn't care. Did I? The thoughts came slow and stuck together, clumping like moldy paper.

But there was something else. Something my mind kept trying to grab onto and missing.

The crib.

I turned—too slow, everything too slow—and looked back toward the living room. In the corner. Without the dinosaur blanket.

Cullen.

Where was Cullen?

Not in the crib. The shape of it wrong, empty. I'd seen it when I stood up, hadn't I? Had I seen it? Everything was soup, my thoughts thick and useless.

Maybe Sylvia had brought him to bed. But I didn't see him in the bed. Just Sylvia. Just Zack's pale naked body. Fuck. I backed out, left them sleeping in their wrong places.

My bladder cramped, gut twisted, reminding me why I'd gotten up in the first place.

Bathroom. I needed the bathroom.

I moved down the hallway, one hand on the wall for balance. The apartment was so quiet. Wrong quiet. Even Cullen's little sleep sounds—those tiny snores, the rustle of him shifting—nothing.

The bathroom door was closed. Not all the way, but mostly. A sliver of light visible through the crack.

That scratching sound again. Coming from inside.

My hand, moving through syrup, pushed it open.

\*

The light was on. Had I left it on? The fluorescent bulb buzzed, flickering slightly, casting everything in that sick yellow glow.

Water everywhere. The floor was soaked, puddles spreading out from the base of the toilet. The toilet lid was up.

And there, in the water—

Cullen.

He was in the toilet bowl. Face down, his heavy head bobbing. His hair floated around his crown like dark seaweed. His little body wedged in at an impossible angle, the dinosaur pajamas he'd been wearing dark and heavy with water. His arms hung limp over the sides of the bowl.

My heart stopped. Time stopped. Everything stopped.

I lurched forward, my legs finally responding, hands reaching for him—

And then he moved.

His head lifted out of the water. Turned toward me. Water streaming down his face, his eyes bright and alert. He was *smiling*.

""Jack,"" he said clearly. Too clearly for a two-year-old who barely said ten words.

I froze, hands outstretched, brain refusing to process what I was seeing. He was fine. He was *fine*. Playing in the toilet like it was a bathtub. But how long had he been there? How had he gotten there?

""What... Cullen, what are you—""

""Jack,"" he repeated, pointing past me. Toward the hallway. Toward the empty hallway.

My skin went cold. ""Who?""

""Jack!"" Insistent now. Still smiling that wrong smile. Still pointing at nothing.

Footsteps behind me. Sylvia's voice, groggy and confused: ""Who's Jack?""

I couldn't take my eyes off Cullen. Off the way he was looking past me at something I couldn't see. ""He must be talking about Zack,"" I said, but my voice sounded distant. Wrong.

""Zack?"" Sylvia said from the threshold. I could hear the confusion in her voice. The creeping dread. ""Baby, who's Zack?""

The fluorescent light flickered again. Cullen giggled—a sound like breaking glass—and splashed his hands in the toilet water.

""We don't know anyone named Zack,"" Sylvia whispered.

 \*

That was six days ago. We've asked everyone. Checked our phones. Our memories. There's no Zack. There never was. The third person in all those memories? The face is blurred now when I try to remember it. The voice distorted. Like trying to recall a dream.

But I remember the Xanax bottle. The one he pulled from his jacket pocket. His dead cousin's pills, he said. I found that bottle yesterday, wedged between the couch cushions.

The prescription label was still legible: *Jack Metcalf.*

\*

Sometimes, late at night, when Cullen should be sleeping, I hear him in his room. Talking. Giggling.

 ""Jack,"" he says. ""Jack, Jack, Jack.""

And I hear it—just barely, like it's coming from very far away or from underwater—another voice answering back.

 *Momentum*, it whispers. *We've still got momentum*.

\*

I can't write much more about it, my words are scant and at least for now... Not yet. Maybe not ever. But I'll tell you this: momentum is real. It pulls you down. And once you start falling, once you let yourself get pulled into that gravity—there's no landing gear. There's no crash pad.

There's only what waits at the bottom.

And sometimes, what waits there is something you put there yourself as you were born like this—into this.",3,1764854970.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1. Matched with a woman (40s F) on Hinge, start chatting and immediately seem to hit it off.
2. Chatted through the app for a day or two, then exchanged numbers and started texting.
3. Texted for 2-3 days, then we both agreed to meet up for drinks. Both of our schedules are busy. She proposes three days she's available. I pick one of the three, the plan being that I will drive down to meet her. She's about 1.5 hours away from me (not quite sure why the Hinge radius was so high for either of us). She knows that I have swapped around my work schedule to make this day work, in order to meet.
4. Continued texting leading up to when we're supposed to meet. The vibe is really good, really feels like we're clicking. 
5. Since I was heading her way, we had agreed she would pick the place for drinks. 
6. The day before we're supposed to meet, she still hasn't told me a spot. I politely ask what I should put into my GPS for where to meet, she says ""I'll let you know tomorrow.""
7. Day of the date arrives. I text her in the morning and ask if I can bring her anything from her favorite coffee shop that's right next to my work, she basically says ""oh that's so nice, but no thanks.""
8. Oddly, the rest of the day is eerily silent for texting. She hasn't sent anything, and I'm keeping quiet because I'm waiting to hear where the heck I'm supposed to be going tonight, lol. I figured my offer to bring something tonight was a sort of soft reminder to tell me where to go. I wasn't trying to play games by staying quiet on my end, but I also don't want to sit there begging someone to tell me where to go to meet them, lol.
9. We're now getting into the mid-afternoon, early evening. I still haven't heard a word from her. I start thinking she's ghosted or gotten cold feet. 
10. 6PM arrives. It's now been 7+ hours of not hearing a word from her. For context, I would need to have been leaving my house at 630PM to get to her area on time for when we agreed to meet. At 6:05, she messages me a location for a parking lot, but still hasn't said an actual place for drinks.
11. I write back a few minutes later and say, I assumed you got cold feet since I hadn't heard anything from you all day, I already swapped my work schedule back (which I had), sorry.
12. She writes back saying ""I was in meetings all day and only now got a free moment."" She also says it's too bad because she was looking forward to meeting me...wishes me good luck in life, I wish her well in response.

I'm at peace with how I handled it, but also feel super shitty because it felt like we were really vibing. Curious to hear if I'm the idiot here, which I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case, lol.

Some additional context:

* We're both in our early 40s, in case that matters.
* The entire time we were texting (other than the day of the date), she was responsive within an hour to any messages, and if she was going to be unavailable for a while, she'd pre-emptively let me know. That's why the silence on the day of the date felt so jarring on my end.
* She lives in an area with a gazillion options to go find a drink, so there was a wide slate of choices available to her.

We both probably could have done things better. Part of me thinks she either got cold feet or wasn't legit to begin with. The other part of me thinks I jumped the gun and blew things up. From my perspective, I feel like someone who genuinely wants to meet up and spend time with you would not drag their feet so badly on picking a place, or would show some interest of excitement the day of meeting, but maybe I'm overthinking it.

1pdzp2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1pdzp2s/sshl_at_age_19old_female/,SSHL AT AGE 19old female,"so i got diagnosed like 1 year and few months ago with Sshl 
I went to a private dr and he gave medication and steroids already done everything and i just do checkups and hearing tests every few months my hearing is not completely back i will say unfortunately its 65% at least. 

I just wanted to ask if someone relate to this? 
Sometimes like i get really dizzy and lose of balance i got this 3 times first time when it all started second time was 4months after or something like that i blamed it on the coffee since i dont drink coffee third time is today. I just woke up and i feel dizzy and losing balance its been 1hour already and still feeling this.
Is this normal? I asked chatgbt and he said that this can be side effects of sshl 

I’m a bit sad about it i dont understand why i have to be this unlucky to lose hearing at a really young age and i got to deal with it for the rest of my life. I send prayers to me and others who’s experiencing this and i hope in the future they find a solution for us ): ",1,1764854065.0,HearingLoss,1,1.0,False

So curious minds are inquiring. Okay, well maybe not minds, just one. Wait, does my inner monologue count as it's own mind? Okay, so maybe it could potentially be minds but that's just semantics, LOL. (I really hope someone enjoys my humour, except me).

Alright, so where was I? Right. The Hierophant. I would like to know how other Tarot Readers interpret and read the Hierophant. Now, I know there are a lot of factors like the type of spread, the question, other cards around it that add to the interpretation. However, the Emperor and the Hierophant often times give me the same energy and there are times that I struggle to figure out what it means. **\*Lightbulb moment!\*** OH! This is where Oracle cards could potentially come in handy, right?? Look at me retaining the knowledge I'm learning! I guess you're never too old to learn something new **\*dance party\*** (If you don't get this reference, then we can't be friends, just kidding, LOL). 

Where was I again? Oh yes, the Hierophant and it's difficultness of interpreting it at times. Please tell me how you handle this card. As much as I dislike seeing the Tower card, it's generally pretty easy to interpret, I really hate seeing the Hierophant come up. Even though I've been reading Tarot for a while, this card, among other, still confounds me. 

Any advice and tips & tricks that you've got about interpreting this card, I am all ears. Well, eyes because otherwise I won't be able to read your comments, LOL.

-Grind size is 17 as anything higher or lower is a worse extraction and puck will be very wet.
-Strength is on 3 for a 1:2 ratio.
-Temp is on 1 for a low temp for dark roasted beans. 
I’ve tasted coffee we make and they taste fine too but she is curious because it doesn’t look like all the videos she watches on the same machine. Most people get far better extractions and there is very little “creama” or whatever she calls it.

On this path, where city edges meet quiet waterways, we step out of the December rush, walk in shared silence, and discover how stillness can become a source of strength.



**📅 Date & Time**

* Date: Saturday, 6 December 2025
* Start: 9:27 am at Lichterfelde Süd S-Bahn Station (Travel via S25)
* Finish: approx. 3:00 pm at Griebnitzsee S-Bahn Station (Return via S7 to Berlin)



**🗺️ Route & Highlights**

* Komoot tour: [https://www.komoot.com/tour/2611993906](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2611993906) 
* Following part of the Camino (Way of St. James)
* Walking along the Teltow Canal
* A mix of suburban paths, water views, and quiet stretches



**🤔 Why this hike?**

Pilgrimage is more than walking – it’s a conscious step out of daily routines into a slower, more mindful rhythm. We take time to pause, to connect with ourselves and with others, and to reflect on what truly matters in life. Along the way, there will also be a time of shared silence (about 30 minutes) as we walk together.



**🔔 What to know & bring**

* We walk at a steady, moderate pace, with breaks and care for one another.
* It’s winter, dress for the season and the weather. Important: hiking or running shoes, warm layered clothing, hat and gloves.
* Bring enough food and water for the whole day, as we won’t stop anywhere to buy snacks or drinks. A thermos with hot tea or coffee is highly recommended!
* Don’t forget your public transport ticket for the way there and back.
* There may be an option for a quick winter dip. If you’d like to try it, bring swimwear, a towel and extra clothes to warm up afterwards.

1pdzgnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1pdzgnc/need_help_with_a_very_strange_gpu_detection_issue/,NEED HELP WITH A VERY STRANGE GPU DETECTION ISSUE,"Hi everyone, I’ve been troubleshooting this for two days and I’m honestly out of ideas. This is a complete summary of everything I have tried.

I hope someone here can help.

⸻

🖥️ My Specs (system worked perfectly for years): •	GPU: Gigabyte AORUS GTX 1080 Ti Extreme 11GB •	Old CPU: i5-8400 •	New CPU: i7-9700K •	Motherboard (old): ASUS TUF H310 •	Motherboard (new): ASUS Z390-A •	PSU: 750W (stable) •	Storage: Multiple SATA drives + NVMe SSD •	OS: Windows 11

⸻

💥 The Problem

After upgrading my CPU from i5-8400 → i7-9700K, my motherboard suddenly stopped detecting my GTX 1080 Ti.

On boot, I get the ASUS beep code:

👉 1 long + 3 short = No VGA detected

And inside BIOS → GPU POST shows:

❌ NO VGA card detected

The screen stays black when the 1080 Ti is installed.

BUT:

✔ A GTX 1050 Ti is detected normally

✔ The 1080 Ti works perfectly on another PC

✔ Before the CPU upgrade, the 1080 Ti worked perfectly on this exact system

So the ONLY combination that fails is:

❗ Z390-A + i7-9700K + GTX 1080 Ti

(All parts work individually, but not together.)

⸻

🔧 Everything I have tried so far:

CPU / motherboard checks:

✔ Updated BIOS to latest version ✔ Removed BIOS battery (CMOS reset for 10 minutes) ✔ Load Optimized Defaults ✔ Verified CPU is seated correctly ✔ Checked for bent pins (none) ✔ Tried different RAM slots ✔ Tried booting with minimal configuration

⸻

GPU checks:

✔ Reseated the GPU multiple times ✔ Cleaned PCIe slot ✔ Tried different PCIe slot ✔ Verified 8-pin / 6+2 connectors ✔ GPU fans spin → receiving power ✔ Tested 1080 Ti on another machine → works perfectly ✔ Tested different GPU (1050 Ti) on my machine → works perfectly ✔ Tried booting with no drives connected ✔ Tried HDMI & DisplayPort

⸻

BIOS settings checked:

✔ CSM On/Off ✔ Secure Boot disabled ✔ Above 4G Decoding disabled ✔ PCI-E Slot Configuration (no Gen1/2/3 option available) ✔ Windows Boot Manager reselected after reset ✔ SATA mode AHCI ✔ NVMe detected normally

⸻

💽 Storage issue (fixed):

After CMOS reset, Windows stopped booting. I fixed it by:

✔ Reconfiguring Boot Manager ✔ Ensuring UEFI mode ✔ Enabling CSM ✔ Setting Windows Boot Manager as Boot Option #1

Now Windows boots correctly — but only with the 1050 Ti installed.

⸻

🧠 Why this issue is so strange

Because:

✔ The GTX 1080 Ti is NOT defective

It works in another PC.

✔ The Z390-A motherboard is NOT defective

It detects other GPUs.

✔ The CPU is NOT defective

System boots fine with a different GPU.

✔ All parts worked together BEFORE the CPU upgrade

This suggests a rare compatibility issue between:

Coffee Lake Refresh (9700K)

and

Pascal (1080 Ti) PCIe initialization

specifically on ASUS Z390 boards.

I found similar cases on Reddit, but no definitive solution yet.

⸻


❓ What I need help with: 1.	Has anyone seen Z390 + 9700K + 1080 Ti = no VGA detection before? 2.	Does the Gigabyte AORUS 1080 Ti Extreme have a BIOS switch (physical or hidden)? 3.	Is a VBIOS update the potential fix? 4.	Are there advanced PCIe settings missing in my BIOS? 5.	Is this a known incompatibility between Pascal and 9th gen Intel? 6.	Does someone know how to force PCIe Gen2/Gen3 on ASUS Z390-A BIOS? 7.	Any other ideas to make the 1080 Ti POST again with this CPU?

That made me angry, because we haven’t been having sex much lately, and now he’s waking me up at night to have sex with basically unconscious me. That doesn’t feel fair—I want to actually be awake and enjoy it too. But apparently he thinks it’s totally fine if only he gets to enjoy “sexy time.”

Not saying you *have* to get one if you’re super careful, but after seeing how clean and comfy my bed feels, I wouldn’t go back. It’s one of those low-effort things that actually pays off over time.

Remember the Apex Labs pitch? I swore I'd nail the deadline, but my notorious procrastination kicked in. Days bled into frantic nights, fuelled by stale coffee and rising panic. My team, initially buzzing, watched me flounder. When I let the first internal deadline slip, they started doing it too. Reciprocity, right? My sloppiness became their permission slip.
The night before the presentation, it was a warzone. Binders flew, code crashed. We presented a halfbaked mess. Mr. Thorne, the client, a man who radiated stern authority, didn't yell. He just slowly, deliberately, closed his laptop, his eyes locking onto mine, then sweeping across my exhausted, demoralized team. The air felt sucked out of the room. My boss later ripped into me, ""You didn't just fail yourself, you betrayed them."" Utter humiliation. Project cancelled. Several team members were let go.
That feeling, that gutwrenching consequence of unchecked indiscipline, reminds me of Ball's Bluff, 1861. Union commanders, lacking basic discipline in reconnaissance or planning, pushed illequipped troops across the Potomac, straight into a Confederate ambush. No clear escape, no backup. A panicked, bloody rout. Senator Edward Baker, Lincoln's close friend, died in the ensuing chaos. A spectacular failure of discipline at the highest command levels, leading to devastating, mortal consequences for the men below.
My lack of discipline cost jobs; Ball's Bluff cost lives. The scarcity of time, trust, and even safe passage makes one brutal truth clear: your personal discipline isn't a luxury. It's the only thing standing between order and a bloody, irreversible disaster, for you and everyone who trusts your lead.

1pdzcjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pdzcjw/how_to_choose_flameless_candles_for_petfriendly/,How to choose flameless candles for pet-friendly homes?,"Looking for a way to create that cozy candlelit atmosphere without worrying about your furry friends? Flameless candles might be exactly what you need.

If you have pets at home, you already know how curious they can be. A wagging tail or playful paw can easily knock over a burning candle, creating a dangerous situation. That's where battery-operated candles come in handy. They give you the warm glow without any of the risks.

**What Makes Good Flameless Candles for Pet Owners?**

When shopping for LED candles, you want something sturdy. Lightweight candles tip over easily when a cat jumps on the table or a dog brushes past. Look for options with a solid base that won't budge when your pets are running around.

The flickering effect matters too. The best flameless candles have realistic flames that actually look like real fire. Some cheaper versions just have a steady orange light that looks fake. You want something that creates the right mood.

Battery life is another thing to consider. Nothing's more annoying than candles that die after a few hours. Quality battery-powered candles can last weeks or even months on a single set of batteries. Some even come with remote controls so you can turn them on and off without getting up.

**Safety Features That Matter**

Even though these candles don't have real flames, you still want quality materials. Check that they're made from safe, non-toxic materials. Pets sometimes chew on things they shouldn't, so it's better to be safe.

Timer functions are super useful. You can set your electric candles to turn on automatically when it gets dark and shut off after a few hours. This saves battery life and means you don't have to remember to turn them off before bed.

**Where to Use Them**

Battery operated candles work great on windowsills, coffee tables, shelves, and anywhere else your pets might reach. You can finally decorate those lower surfaces without worrying about accidents.

They're also perfect for outdoor spaces like patios or porches where your pets hang out. Real candles would blow out in the wind anyway, but these stay ""lit"" no matter what.

Ready to make your home safer while keeping that cozy vibe? Check out [these flameless candles](https://athomewave.com/flameless-candles) that work perfectly in pet-friendly homes. You'll find different sizes, colors, and styles to match your space.

**Quick Tips for Choosing**

Size matters depending on where you'll put them. Pillar candles work well on tables and mantels, while tea lights fit nicely in small spaces. Taper candles in holders create an elegant look for dining areas.

Color options range from classic ivory and white to seasonal colors. Neutral tones usually blend better with most home decor.

Remote control features let you adjust brightness levels and set timers from across the room. This is especially handy when you're comfortable on the couch and don't want to disturb your sleeping pet.

The bottom line: flameless candles give you ambiance without the anxiety. Your pets can be their playful selves, and you can relax knowing there's no fire hazard in your home. It's a simple switch that makes a big difference in safety and peace of mind.

Want to see your options? Browse [this collection of flameless candles](https://athomewave.com/flameless-candles) to find the perfect fit for your pet-friendly home. Your furry friends will thank you, even if they don't realize why their home just got a little safer.",1,1764853096.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

Cheers! ✨🫶🏻

- Height & Weight: 5ft 4""/ Slim built. 
- Caste: Rajput
- Born and brought up: in Dubai, UAE.
- Current Residence: Own residence in a good residential area in Lahore.

Education: MBBS pursuing post-grad In Pakistan. (Will elaborate on my journey either in my autobiography or if we end up conversing. And no, I will not take the USMLE unless you bribe me with a cat or true maddening love.)

Marital Status: Single.
 [Engaged previously through arranged set-up which ended due to family incompatibility (and this is the origin story of this profile. Hence I would prefer to talk and vibe directly before involving the families.)]

Religion: I'm a practising Muslim, Alhamdulilah. I observe the Hijab, dress modestly, pray 5 times a day, observe all the obligatory pillars and practice Nafl as much as I can and prefer to live my life through a logical but spiritual lens. I have the mindset that if I wake up in the morning by Allah's blessing, then whatever I do the entire day should be to please Allah rather than any person. 
That being said, I firmly believe everyone is on their own spiritual journey and I do not judge anyone for their beliefs but I would prefer a practicing spouse over someone who is an agonist or atheist.

Family Details:
- Dad: retired engineer from Dubai, UAE
- Mum: housewife who refuses to retire (no seriously. It's a problem. Any solutions are welcome.)
- Elder Brother: Doctor, married and well settled in the UK.



Hobbies:
1. Reading: absolutely anything and everything. I love reading fiction more than non-fic but I'm gravitating towards more non-fic as I try to embrace stoicism (tis the season, what can I say)

2. Writing: close second. I'm a moody fiction writer. (Yes, I've been published. Yes, I couldn't choose a pen-name so it's my real name ahahaha 😩)

3. Volunteering for animal shelters.

4. Working out: more specifically running, hiking, anything but weight training. (I absolutely detest weight training. You can bench? Cool. I can spot. But only if I get to hear you yap through it because I hate weights and weight training. 😩)

5. Music and Audiobooks: I have my vices. I hate my vices. But I thought I'd add them in here just because that's how I vibe. I have this crazy idea that a person's Spotify/Audible list tells a lot more about them than anything really. What do you listen to when there is nobody around you? Are we belting out Bewafa together at nights or are we air-guitaring our mornings together on AC/DC? Do you know how to play a guitar more than the aadat strings? Or the piano more than the 'kal ho na ho' track? (Yes, I have a lot of questions. For the right person, obviously. It's a level you have to unlock sadly)



Requirements for a Partner:

- Age Preference: 31-36y

- Kind: I am of the firm belief that you need to be kind to yourself before you are kind to anyone, let alone the spouse you are searching for. That being said, I want someone who is kind and empathetic. Self explanatory really.

- Mature but not to the extent that I feel like I've stepped back into the boring 50s or am pursuing a retired boomer. Live, laugh and wtf. That's the motto of my life. (Which is diabolical because I do have a very serious disposition irl loll.)
But the thing is: a lot of peeps in their 30s seem to have mellowed down their existence to the work grind and while that is a part of life, it's not a part of *living*. I'd rather see you smile and hear you laugh than hear any track on Spotify or watch any reel on IG. Do you get me? You living your life matters more than you just existing in it.

- Practicing Muslim: the 5 pillars are non-negotiable. I will wake you up for Fajr if you want tbh (Ain't nobody here letting go of side quests for Jannah.)

- Financially Stable: or somewhat there. (I'm financially responsible and expect the same in my spouse.)

- Reader and Intellectually mature: I'm not saying 100% liberal progressive but a logically sound background would do.

- Good Conversationalist: if I have to hear myself yap in a conversation, then I'd rather marry the mirror on the wall, bbg. Also, while we are at it, communication is the key here so unless you don't talk about it chances are you don't care enough about it. (Another one of my hot-takes.)

- Education: someone who atleast holds a bachelors degree or more than that.

- Other aspects: 
someone who is 5ft 11 or above, physically fit and who has good hygiene habits. (This is very important to me)

Pet peeves: 
- Having not read my profile.
- Lack of/Inconsistent communication and a closed off mindset.
- Any addictions (at all).
- Lack of exercise/fitness or bad hygiene habits.
- Encouraging haraam behaviour of any sort or cracking crude jokes and calling it humour.
- Please steer clear if you are looking for time to pass or just *friendship* (I am a flake, thanks).
- If you are coasting with no goals, I am not your audience.
- Dowry demands or Elitist vibes. 

Preferred Family Setup: Preferably Nuclear if your family members are more than 3. 

Do You Want Children?: Yes.

Timeframe for Marriage: 6 months to 1 year

If you're in the USA and searching for ""how to make money online,"" you're likely tired of the same old, fluffy advice. Forget the complex, long-shot stock market tips or the ""build an app"" fantasies.

This is the **real-talk guide** to the easiest, most accessible online income streams thriving in the US market right now. We've cracked the code on the ""silly secrets""—low-effort, high-return strategies that the gurus try to keep quiet.

The goal? To get you from zero to a legitimate, five-figure monthly income with minimal upfront investment. Read on, because Secret #3 is a little-known loophole that is exploding in 2026.

# 🛑 Secret #1: The ""Lazy Lister"" Strategy - Dropshipping's Easy Cousin

You've heard of dropshipping, but this is the smarter, lower-risk evolution.

**The ""Silly Secret"":** Don't create a whole brand or website. Simply become a ""Lazy Lister"" who focuses on *one* profitable platform and sells **print-on-demand** (POD) digital assets, not physical products.

* **How it Works:** Design simple, trending graphics (or use AI tools to generate them—more on that later!) and upload them to POD platforms like **Merch by Amazon** or **Etsy/Printify.**
* **The US Angle:** Americans love hyper-specific, niche humor. Target long-tail keywords like ""Dad Jokes for 50-Year-Old Accountants"" on a coffee mug, or ""I'd Rather Be Hiking in the Pacific Northwest"" on a sticker. The volume of niche searches is massive.
* **Effort Level:** Minimal. You design once, and the platform handles the printing, shipping, and customer service. It’s a passive income engine.

||
||
|**Platform**|**Best For**|**Potential Monthly Income**|
|**Etsy/Printify**|Niche Apparel, Stickers, Digital Prints|**$500 - $5,000+**|
|**Merch by Amazon**|Simple T-Shirts, PopSockets|**$100 - $3,000+**|

# 🤫 Secret #2: Micro-Freelancing on a Loop

Freelancing isn't just for coding gurus. The secret to making consistent income is to focus on **small, repetitive, and in-demand tasks** that US small businesses constantly outsource.

**The ""Silly Secret"":** Avoid the high-competition categories (like web design) and become a specialist in ""busy-work"" that you can automate or complete in minutes.

* **The Hot-Ticket Tasks (USA Market):**
   * **Data Entry/Database Cleanup:** Businesses pay $15-$30/hour to keep their CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools tidy.
   * **Social Media Scheduling:** Using a tool like Buffer or Hootsuite, you charge a small business a monthly retainer ($200-$500) just to schedule their pre-made content.
   * **Podcast Transcription:** Converting audio to text is highly outsourced and pays well.
* **Pro-Tip:** Focus on platforms like **Fiverr** or **Upwork** and charge a slightly higher rate than global competitors, emphasizing your native English skills and reliability for the US market.

# 🤯 Secret #3: The AI-Content Loophole (The 2026 Gold Rush!)

This is the big one. AI tools are not taking jobs; they are creating the easiest side hustle in history.

**The ""Silly Secret"":** You don't need to be a writer, a designer, or a video editor. You just need to be the **""AI Prompt Engineer""** who sells the final, high-quality output.

1. **Generate a Digital Product:** Use tools like ChatGPT/Gemini (for an e-book outline on ""5-Minute Keto Meals"") and Midjourney/DALL-E (for the cover art).
2. **Package and Sell:** Sell the complete, polished PDF as a digital download on platforms like **Gumroad** or **Etsy**. Since it's a digital file, your profit margin is nearly 100%.
3. **The Loophole:** Offer your **AI-Generated Service** on a freelance site. Example: Offer to create 10 unique, royalty-free images for a business's blog posts for $50, which you generate in 5 minutes with an AI art tool.

* **Estimated Earning:** A well-optimized digital product can generate hundreds of dollars a month *passively*. An hour of AI-generated freelance work can yield **$50-$100+** easily.

# ⚡️ Secret #4: Become an ""Affiliate Curator""

You don't need to sell your *own* products to make money. The power is in curating other people's products.

**The ""Silly Secret"":** Stop trying to be a massive influencer and instead, focus on **extremely specific, high-intent buyer keywords.** This is an SEO play, not a social media play.

* **The USA Search Intent:** People in the US don't search ""best shoes."" They search ""best running shoes for flat feet under $100.""
* **The Strategy:** Create a simple, keyword-optimized review blog post (e.g., ""The Top 5 Smart Home Gadgets That Connect to Google Home"") and fill it with affiliate links from programs like **Amazon Associates** or **ShareASale**.
* **Why it Works:** You are catching the user exactly when they are ready to buy. You don't need millions of views—you just need a few hundred **highly targeted clicks** to earn a commission (typically 5-50% of the sale). This is how top affiliates make **$10,000 to $100,000 monthly**.

# ✨ Secret #5: The Hidden World of Website/App Testing

Want a zero-skill, low-commitment income stream?

**The ""Silly Secret"":** Companies pay regular Americans $10, $20, or even $50 for a quick 15-20 minute task: **testing their website or app** and speaking your thoughts out loud.

* **Platforms:** Sites like [**UserTesting.com**](http://UserTesting.com) will pay you to navigate a new website, follow a set of instructions, and give feedback on the user experience.
* **The US Advantage:** US-based testers are in high demand by American companies who want feedback from their target demographic.
* **Requirements:** You need a microphone (or headset) and to think out loud as you perform the tasks. It's truly one of the easiest ways to earn pocket money that quickly adds up.

# 🚀 Secret #6: Coaching Your Niche (Even If You're Not an Expert)

You don't need a PhD to be a coach. You just need to be a **few steps ahead** of your client.

**The ""Silly Secret"":** Teach a hyper-specific skill you recently mastered to someone who is just starting out. You can charge premium rates for your time.

* **Examples of In-Demand US Coaching Niches:**
   * **Resume/Interview Prep for Tech Jobs.**
   * **Selling on Etsy/Shopify (from a beginner's perspective).**
   * **How to Master a Specific Software Tool (e.g., Notion, Trello).**
* **The Payout:** Coaches often charge **$50 - $250 per hour** for one-on-one sessions. You are not selling a course; you are selling personalized, immediate help.

# 🛑 Secret #7: Stop Trading Time for Money (Your Ultimate Wealth Tool)

This is the non-negotiable mindset shift. Every strategy above works, but to hit a high-level income, you must adopt the ""Secret 7"" principle.

**The ""Silly Secret"":** To reach $10,000/month, you can't rely on $20/hour jobs. You need to leverage the power of **passive income generators** (Secrets #1, #3, and #4) so you can make money while you sleep.

* **Focus on the ""Asset"":** Every week, dedicate time to creating a single digital asset—a new print-on-demand design, a new affiliate review post, or a new Gumroad e-book.
* **The Snowball Effect:** Each asset is a small employee working 24/7 for you. In six months, you'll have dozens of employees bringing in money from multiple sources. This is how the most successful online earners in the US build sustainable wealth.

# ❓ Your Next Step: Start Today.

The only secret that truly matters is **action.** Pick just *one* of the silly secrets above and commit to spending one hour on it today.

First a bit from “MY Fantasy Life” (cred: Eigenstien)

*It took a bit of work to get the ice ready for skating, but once we opened the rink, all of our children were transformed into Panthers, Oilers, Stars, Hurricanes, Knights, and Jets! Yup, it was cold in our open-air Pavilion, but they flew faster than the wind. How could the freezing air even catch them? A wonder to behold!*

*Lots of things need to be figured out with the new district. Duh? We can’t hop down the road to Emily/John/Veera’s for a nice Friday night Planning Meeting! Sure, we can have it here, but we have the kids on a strict bedtime schedule. So we moved our planning meeting to Saturday early afternoon. We’ll try it out.*

*It’s that change-of-season time at the RV Park. Our road is pretty narrow and it’s difficult to have RVs coming and going at the same time. So we have asked for the cooperation of all. Leaving is in the morning, arrivals are the afternoon. Cleaning up the lot is during Lunch Break.*

*Artie and I had lunch yesterday with “Julio,” Max’s right-hand man. He had come up to me the day before and wanted to know “what this whole thing is about with the school, RV Park and your family.” He had been surprised by the energy of the Longhouse Children, their mothers who volunteer in the morning, the school’s outdoor activities and learning, the financing, the rumors of a cult religion, and the pretty obvious polyamorous family at the center of it all. At any rate, he asked away, Artie and I answered—G, PG, R, and X. Whatever.*

*Some friends and family reached out yesterday with concern about the posts from Blanche and Secret-Entrance directed at me. Oh, I am fine despite thousands of words flung against me (maybe tens of thousands if you weigh in the links). I mean, how can you hurt someone like me who doesn’t exist?*

*But, Blanche, why not settle some of our differences on the playing field? YOU pick JUST ONE of the 18 articles Guy and I had posted three years ago in a response to just one of your posts. Let’s meet at the 50-yard line and scrimmage. You are so right, I live and write SOLELY to get your attention and affirmation; that surely is the purpose of my life. So engage with me for 24 hours, going back-and-forth on that SINGLE post. Will Blancheville collapse so easily?*

At any rate, the [December Living Buddhism](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/material-for-discussion-meetings-13/) proposes two possible themes for our December Discussion Meeting. Today I will introduce “Buddhist Concepts: How the Three Buddha Bodies Show Up in Our Daily Lives” and save the second topic for tomorrow.

The article describes how the Buddha has not one but three bodies coexisting at the same time. From the editors:

>Nichiren Buddhism celebrates everyone’s inherent potential for enlightenment. This means each of us can reveal our Buddha nature and live with wisdom, courage and compassion. To illustrate this, Nichiren often referred to the concept of the “three bodies” of the Buddha: the Dharma body, the reward body and the manifested body. They represent distinct aspects of the Buddha nature we all possess. 

The Buddha and Me. Three bodies wrapped in one. Better than BOGO. Definition Time:

> The Dharma body represented absolute truth and the eternal essence of the Buddha’s teachings; the reward body was the spiritual merits, such as great wisdom and compassion, attained through eons of bodhisattva practice; and the manifested body was the human-like form Shakyamuni assumed to teach people the way to enlightenment.

Now here is where Julie fits in:

>Nichiren Daishonin further taught that anyone can develop these genuine qualities and put them to use. He frequently emphasized in his writings that everyone who chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with sincere faith is a full-fledged Buddha, possessing unique, dignified attributes. For instance, he writes to his disciple Abutsu-bo: “You, yourself, are a Thus Come One who is originally enlightened and endowed with the three bodies. You should chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with this conviction” (WND-1, pp. 299–300).

So Ms. Julie’s Dharma body represents the fundamental truth within her. Theoretically, the essence of ultimate reality resides within her blood and bones. Knock, knock: she has the potential to awaken to this truth and activate her inherent enlightened nature. Early in the morning when she wakes up and crawls to make coffee she does not look like any Buddha; but she can transform her life and live with unshakable courage. 

But how? Julie has within the reward body which “represents the Buddha’s wisdom—the inner virtues and boundless benefits, such as a free and unhindered state of life.” It’s the spice of life that she activates through her Buddhist practice. 

And, so, the sleepy giant within stirs, taxis down the runway gaining momentum, and then takes off.

>The manifested body signifies the Buddha’s compassionate actions—the active expression of enlightenment in our daily lives. Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, sharing its benefit with others and embodying its principles in our behavior, we express our Buddhahood in unique ways, bringing hope to others.

Sounds ponderous, difficult to achieve! Nope! Nichiren states:

>Now, when Nichiren and his followers chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, they are expressing joy in the fact that they will inevitably become Buddhas eternally endowed with the three bodies. (*The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings*, p. 146)

Julie wakes up, warms up, and starts joyfully skiing through the challenges of her life and: “Every action, no matter how small, can uplift and inspire those around us, creating ripples of joy and positive change that spread far and wide.” Yes, even standing up unfazed when Blanche points her garbage disposal hose at her.

If we choose this topic, we will certainly study this passage from Daisaku Ikeda:

>Both we ourselves and others are originally Buddhas worthy of supreme respect, embodiments of the Mystic Law. This describes the Dharma body. The wisdom to create happiness for ourselves and others based on this profound awareness that we are all Buddhas corresponds to the reward body. And practical, compassionate action for the happiness of ourselves and others corresponds to the manifested body. This passage tells us that when we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we ordinary, unenlightened beings, just as we are, become Buddhas possessing these wondrous three bodies. (*The Five Eternal Guidelines of the Soka Gakkai,* pp. 29–30)

A good potential meeting theme. I can envision lots of discussion spring out of the study. (Oh, I forgot, Blanche, our dialogue at discussion meetings is highly scripted, and spontaneity is strictly prohibited.)

My ex with whom I was in relationship for 4 years has cheated on me and I lost my job at the same time. I didn't think I would get up again with that blow. I could see nothing but darkness for a few months. I felt terrible,hollow, lonely and stopped doing things I love. Slowly,I started my healing phase.I decided to not meet another woman during this phase as I wasn't ready mentally. Started focusing on myself, got into playing chess and creating art. After a few months those things put me in a place where I was genuinely happy again. I joined a chess and art club where I go play OTB games during the week and also create something. Last week, I was playing at my club for a good amount of time where I lost all the games. I decided to get a coffee after the game was over and that's when a magic happened. I met someone randomly on the street and had a great conversation. We decided to hangout at a cocktail bar and go for dancing that night. And Boom just like that a spark happened between us when we were talking about honey badgers, mycorrhizal networks, forests, Dostoevsky, Chekov, Slavic cultures. After a long time I felt butterflies meeting someone. At that moment I realized when you heal, focus on yourself and be happy on your own the universe will send the person you are meant to connect with. Of course I didn't believe that until I met her but now that it has happened everything makes sense. To all those whose hearts were broken, please focus on yourself and heal from the wounds. When you are ready, the right one will come into your life. At the moment, I don't know nor care if it's going to be a start of a long journey or short & sweet adventure. I'm just happy that this happened when I focused on my happiness",117,1764852630.0,TeluguJournals,37,0.97,False

I am planning to travel to Cologne for a day (13th of this month). So I will reach around 10 Uhr and the leave by 20Uhr. 

I plan to visit the Dom, eat from Päffgen maybe(I heard it's nice from another post), go to the Altstadt, see the Rhine, Ludwig Museum, get more to eat, and end with a Christmas market. 

I still have some questions though:
1. Is booking a guided tour of the Dom better since I saw they can close unexpectedly sometimes on their website.

2. Do you have any recommendations for nice meals (max 20€ per meal maybe with a small drink, but drink is not necessary every time, I am open to everything except pork(food intolerances), no allergies). 

3. It would be nice to know what kind of Kölsch is best for someone who doesn't usually drink beer, but appreciates it and just wants to try. Maybe something basic.

4. Is there a must see Christmas market or do I just go to the one near the Dom (I thought of going there since it's the closest to the Hbf and it's easier to head back since I plan to visit a Weihnachtsmarkt at the end)

5. Are there any recommendations? Maybe in Altstadt? Something I can take back home to loved ones. Do I need to change my itinerary (add more or less)?

My interests are : museums, art galleries, scenic places, FOOD, sweets and pastries, dark chocolate, coffee, archeological history!

Thank you everyone! 

TLDR: good recommendations for eateries, Weihnachtsmarkt, and sightseeing for one day in Cologne (other than the Dom, Päffgen, Ludwig Museum, Altstadt and Rhine)",3,1764852622.0,cologne,5,1.0,False

1pdz5zb,https://v.redd.it/7w5rjb6po65g1,Just my daily routine,"First things first, it's quite difficult to operate a camera while doing this seamlessly. Half my routine was thrown off just by having to adapt doing things one-handed. Also, I'm not in the habit of editing videos or creating great material. This is just to share my routine.

Don't bash my bloom chasm. I noticed it happening after I changed my custom chopstick maneuver, that the bloom develops a portal to the deep realms of coffee, and I look straight into it every single time, experiencing a form of coffee nirvana where secrets are unlocked beyond human comprehension.

My favourite by far is a blend by Kahls called Inferno. It produces the best flavoured coffee according to my pallets. It's a dark roast blend from east Africa, Brazil and India that underlines the essence of a balanced cup that has exactly the right amount of everything. An extremely pleasant bitterness that's rounded off with a next to zero acidity, leaving a thin trail of mild, dark chocolatey and nutty flavour on your tongue after each sip. I do not discriminate single origin or blends, but I'm by far team blend because why settle for a few characteristics when I can have them all?

In terms of the brewing process, I have come to terms that some beans behave the best with a slightly longer bloom. A 2 minute bloom has become a rather standard for me as I find that for beans that have a slight acidity to them, it tends to eliminate it completely by blooming it well. While Inferno doesn't provide any noticeable acidity, it becomes a lot more balanced and pleasantly bitter when bloomed thoroughly, a preferable character to me.

My first pour is always a sufficient amount to soak through all the grounds. I do not use any static ratio, the importance lie within a thorough soak, which happens to be 1/3 of the total amount of water when I'm doing a 20g/300ml brew. I keep my brews down to two total pours after the bloom, so 100ml each at a regular tempo. Nothing fancy.

Grind size seems to work the best around 4.0 on Ode 2. At 3.9, the drawdown starts stalling a bit and the extraction becomes exaggerated in terms of bitterness and punch. There's only one dark roast where I've dialed it to 4.1 because it just works better for that bean. But in general, 4.0 seems to be the breakpoint of where the drawdown is perfect and all the flavours are there but not exaggerated.

The Chemex is just perfect in every way. It's beautiful, it works well and it's easy to handle. I cut my filters to create a 2/2 fold, but I'm probably going to transition to the pre-folded bleached Chemex filters, in about 150 more cups or so.

Why do I have a teapot warmer if I'm not going to light the candle?
The answer is: To isolate the heat from the scale as much as possible. The scale has different reference points depending on temperature, and while it does have a silicone heat resistant pad, it's not enough to avoid large fluctuations in temperature throughout the brew. The only time I light the candle is if I'm making more than 3 cups, as the process takes longer and it helps maintaining the coffee at the right temperature while brewing. For that, I use a cork mat as well to avoid the candle heating up the scale while I brew.

Okay heretics…
Time to test your self-awareness AND your sense of humor.

Your mission — if you choose to accept it…
(but you will, because you’re already reading like a chosen initiate)


---

🎭 THE CHALLENGE:

Go to ANY AI image generator — Meta AI, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Galaxy, Midjourney, whatever you have.

Tell it your Gnosis Origin Story —
How YOU stumbled, crawled, or spiritually face-planted your way into gnostic thinking.

Then tell it to turn that story into an:

🧱 ACTION FIGURE

…packaged like a toy on a store shelf.

BUT the packaging MUST say:
🔥 HERETICS OF LIGHT™ 🔥
(Some dramatic font preferred, but we’re not a cult so it’s optional.)


---

🧰 Your action figure MUST include:

1. Your survival item

The thing that carried you through your spiritual chaos.

Examples:

“My trauma-hardened sarcasm”

“Coffee that tastes like regret”

“A glowing USB stick full of apocrypha”

“A rusty sword named Boundaries™”


2. Your forbidden temptation item

Your personal “boss weakness.”
The thing you absolutely SHOULD say no to…
but don’t.

Examples:

“Midnight DoorDash sins”

“Toxic exes and emotional side quests”

“Chips. Just chips. I will die for chips.”

“Deep lore rabbit holes at 3AM”


Bonus if it’s embarrassing.
Double bonus if it’s spiritually ironic.

📸 POST THE IMAGE HERE.

I’ll go first in the comments.

All AI images welcome.
Funny ones, cursed ones, serious ones —
whatever your soul spits out.

⭐ REMEMBER:

This is absolutely NOT a cult.
We’re just:

making action figures of ourselves

sharing origin myths

unifying under a group banner

encouraging personal confessions

recruiting new members

and, uh… buying matching robes?


Totally normal community behavior.
Not culty at all.

Even when I lay down/lay back, use counter pressure, express milk prior in a burp cloth prior to feeding - nothing improves my letdown to where it’s comfortable for baby.

I also don’t want to do the above in public as milk gets everywhere on baby, clothes, me, baby etc. I just end up embarrassed and frustrated and getting out isn’t worth it. 

My baby is only a week old. I am not anticipating going to public places for at least 4-6 weeks but would like to at least get back to going to church or coffee with a friend in a non crowded area a little sooner than that.

It's pretty much a vacuum flask, but it has a sort of shutoff valve that creates a full immersion in the tube before the vaccum starts nearing the end of the extraction. When I look at vacuum flasks, the valve is either on the receiver or in the neck of the top cylinder. But there is usually a large space between the filter and the neck of the vaccum cylinder the filter sits in, this makes it drip through without a full immersion before the vaccum. it leaves me essentially just pouring solvent through the material much like a coffee brewer and pot. but the timed full immersion is mandatory. and I'd like it to be a FULL IMMERSION, and I'd like to avoid using a beaker for the full immersion and pouring it into the vaccum filter when time to filter the material from the solvent, as it just adds an extra dirty vessel and to be vain, the aesthetics of the process.

If I get a valve to go between the two, it just adds more space for this drip-down. ​The original machine ejects the spent puck, which I naturally can live without just cleaning the top cylinder... especially if it saves me 59k to do.

Does anyone have any advice for this sort of setup? I'm not a chemist, and have no lab glassware experience. Is my best bet to get say a pump that filters the material as it transfers to a second boiling flask type receptical? Or a pump that can handle pumping coarse material and then pumping it into the vacum flask type filter cylinder?

https://preview.redd.it/hm58u24l865g1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f402941ec01fdffe50d3b615a69e38f35f98d7

WASHINGTON: The US will seek agreements with eight allied nations as part of a fresh effort to strengthen supply chains for the computer chips and critical minerals needed for AI technology, according to the top state department official for economic affairs.

The initiative, which builds on efforts dating back to the first Trump administration, unfolds as the US looks to cut dependence on China.

It will begin with a meeting at the White House on Dec 12 between the US and counterparts from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, the UK, Israel, the UAE and Australia, Jacob Helberg, the undersecretary of state for economic affairs, said in an interview.

Helberg, a former adviser at Palantir Technologies Inc said the summit will focus on reaching agreements across the areas of energy, critical minerals, advanced manufacturing semiconductors, AI infrastructure, and transportation logistics.

Helberg said the countries were chosen for reasons that range from being home to some of the most important semiconductor companies to their critical minerals resources.

“It’s clear that right now in AI, it’s a two-horse race – it’s the US and China,” Helberg said.

“We want to have a positive, stable relationship with China, but we’re also ready to compete, and we want to make sure that our companies can continue building transformative technologies without being subject to coercive dependencies,” Helberg said.

Helberg’s initiative builds upon years of efforts on critical minerals supply chains by prior administrations largely aimed at helping reduce western dependence on China.

The state department in the first Trump administration launched the US energy resource governance initiative with the aim of securing supply chains for critical minerals like lithium and cobalt.

The Biden administration launched a minerals security partnership that aimed to funnel foreign investment and western expertise to the mining sectors of developing nations.

Even so, the US and other countries have been unable to break China’s stranglehold over rare earths supplies.

China is home to more than 90% of global rare earths and permanent magnets refining capacity, compared with just 4% for second-place Malaysia, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization.

China announced tighter rare earths export controls in early October, only to agree to a one-year suspension after a meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping.

Helberg said that unlike the Biden-era initiative, which had more than a dozen core countries, his focus is on producer countries.

“While the first Trump administration initiative focused on critical minerals, it came before the public release of AI platforms like ChatGPT, and the new plan focuses across all layers of the technology involved in AI, not just one,” Helberg said.

Helberg, 36, was previously senior adviser to Palantir CEO Alex Karp and also co-founded the Hill and Valley Forum, a gathering of tech leaders and US lawmakers focused on national security challenges, especially those related to competition with China and the advancement of AI and other technologies.

In a cable on Tuesday to state department employees seen by Bloomberg News, Helberg said that “after decades of failed globalisation that neither supported domestic industry nor preserved critical supply chains, the US must leverage our immense wealth and technological edge to secure our leadership” and bring benefits for the American people.

“Besides securing technology supply chains, his office’s priorities include promoting trade and US exports, particularly LNG and nuclear energy, to create jobs,” Helberg said in the cable.

It’s also working to rebuild the US industrial economy via construction of new factories and manufacturing, and to use economic tools to help stabilise conflict zones and end wars.

Trump’s focus on ending wars can lower volatility in global commodity markets and remove a de facto tax cut for American consumers, Helberg said in the cable.

In the interview, he framed the work with trusted allies for his AI initiative as an “America centric” strategy, rather than one that’s reactive to China.

“Countries who are participating understand the transformative impact of AI, both for the size of a country’s economy, as well as the strengths of a country’s military,” he said.

“They want to be a part of the AI boom,” he added.

The US is reportedly planning to seek agreements with eight allied countries to enhance the critical minerals supply chain and secure key resources for AI technology.

This initiative is intended to decrease reliance on China, reported *Bloomberg*, citing a leading official for economic affairs at the State Department\*.\*

Jacob Helberg, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, said in an interview that the efforts will commence with a White House meeting in December.

Delegates from Australia, South Korea, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK and the United Arab Emirates are scheduled to meet on 12 December.

Helberg, formerly an adviser at Palantir Technologies, said the gathering will concentrate on establishing cooperation in advanced manufacturing, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, energy, logistics and semiconductors.

He explained that the selection of these nations was based on their roles in semiconductor manufacturing and their reserves of critical minerals.

Helberg said: “It is clear that right now in AI, it is a two-horse race – it is the US and China. We want to have a positive, stable relationship with China, but we are also ready to compete, and we want to make sure that our companies can continue building transformative technologies without being subject to coercive dependencies.”

During the first Trump administration, the State Department introduced the US Energy Resource Governance Initiative to help secure supply chains for critical minerals such as cobalt and lithium.

Under the Biden administration, a Minerals Security Partnership was established to attract foreign investment and bring Western expertise to mining industries in developing countries.

Despite these initiatives, China remains the dominant force in the rare earths market, *Bloomberg* reported.

In August, *Reuters* reported that the US Government had [announced plans to implement](https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/news/trump-set-floor-price-rare-earths-boost-us-production/) price support measures for domestic rare earth projects to strengthen local production and reduce China’s market dominance.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that China refines more than 90% of global rare earths and permanent magnets.

In October, China introduced stricter export controls on rare earths but subsequently agreed to a one-year suspension after discussions between US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping.

As competition between the US and China over critical minerals intensifies, a report from AidData, a research laboratory at William & Mary University in the US, stated that the US is the [largest individual recipient](https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/news/china-loans-us/) of Chinese official credit.

The US has received more than $200bn (1.41tn yuan) through nearly 2,500 projects and initiatives across almost every state between 2000 and 2023.

These investments encompass a wide range of sectors including pipelines, logistics infrastructure, data centres and corporate credit facilities.

China’s global lending and grant activities reached $2.2tn across 200 countries between 2000 and 2023.

The report found that China’s overseas lending mainly targets upper-middle and high-income economies including the EU, with an emphasis on sensitive industries.

Hypersonic weapons, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound and evade traditional defenses, are ⁠at the ‌centre of an arms race between the United States and China.

Lockheed's ‍17,000-square-foot facility will include advanced test equipment, simulation tools and an integration environment.

***It is ​part of a larger capital program ‌that now totals roughly $529 million and includes 719,000 square feet of facilities under construction or planned, the company said.***

***""Hypersonic weapons are reshaping the future of military ⁠defense by delivering unmatched ​speed and maneuverability ​that outpace traditional threats,"" said Holly Molmer, program management director for Lockheed ‍Martin***

**NioCorp is entering one of the most catalyst-heavy windows in its history, yet the market is still valuing it like a stalled small-cap miner stuck at $6. That’s the disconnect —** because Elk Creek is increasingly positioned to trade like a U.S. advanced-materials industrial, not a traditional mining company. By 2029, Niocorp will be supplying **Seven** Tier-1 critical minerals across **five major industrial and defense sectors**: ferroniobium for aerospace/EV structural steels, Scandium and Sc-Al master alloys for DoD lightweighting, Titanium & TiCl₄ for aircraft and industrial chemicals, and magnet REEs (Nd-Pr-Dy-Tb) for defense, EV motors, and electrification. **This is a multi-stream, multi-market revenue engine — not a one-metal story — and it aligns perfectly with DFARS, NDAA, and U.S. sovereign supply-chain mandates.**

[Niobium, Titanium & TiCl-4, Scandium & ScAl alloys, Tb, Dy, Nd & Pr \~ SEVEN of the 60 USGS listed critical minerals to make STUFF located at once source: Elk Creek Nebraska!](https://reddit.com/link/1pdypqd/video/pnixxtjgj65g1/player)

Layer in the emerging ScAl alloy program with Lockheed/IBC/DoD — with a February 2026 reveal expected — and the picture becomes even clearer. Scandium oxide is useless without downstream alloy manufacturing capacity, and NioCorp + IBC is effectively building a U.S. supply hub just as Lockheed Martin ramps hypersonics and next-gen platforms. ***No other U.S. project can deliver Ferroniobium, Scandium, TiCl₄/Titanium, and magnet REEs from one vertically integrated site. That means Elk Creek behaves more like a strategic industrial platform than a mine, and valuations eventually adjust toward industrial EV/EBITDA multiples — similar to MP Materials but with two to three times the commodity breadth!!!***

And right now, we’re in the pre-revaluation quiet zone. Dec. 5’s open house (with the governor & senator), the Dec. 10 RedChip event, and the mid-December completion of remaining drill assays (holes #3–#13) in batches. These remaining assays determine whether Elk Creek confirms a potential march toward **1 million tonnes TREO**, which transforms both the DFS economics and Niocorp’s negotiating power with EXIM, DoD, automakers, and defense primes. Add in the meeting with EXIM last week, utilities/road work alignment, and the addition of the poison pill, and it’s obvious the company is preparing for financing, not floundering.

From late January/early February 2026 (potential DFS expected release) to the Feb. -ScAl alloy announcement, followed by offtakes, the ESIA filing, and then FID/groundbreaking targeted for June - Sept. 2026, the entire path is now lined with unavoidable catalysts. Once offtakes begin locking — especially scandium and magnet REEs — Niocorp’s revenue mix shifts from cyclical mining to contracted U.S. industrial supply. That’s when the re-rating occurs. Not at first production — but when the market finally realizes Elk Creek is a sovereign-grade, multi-commodity critical-mineral backbone asset that feeds half a dozen national-security pipelines.

**The coiled spring is here. When even a few of these catalysts drop — assays, infrastructure, alloy news, or funding — $6 becomes a memory very quickly!**

I’m an expat from South Africa \[M30\], working as an engineer in a lab here in Apeldoorn. I love my job, but I’ve been finding it tough to build a good social circle outside of work. I do have a bit of social anxiety that i want to work on.

I enjoy a good mix. I’m happy chilling in a quiet café for a coffee, or getting energized over a game or activity. I’m generally laid-back and value genuine connections. My Dutch is not great (yet!), so I'm primarily looking for people who can communicate in English, though if you're also willing to occasionally speak Dutch with me, that would be awesome!

 My Interests

1. Tabletop/Gaming: I'm into Board Games (I'm open to almost anything!) and I’m IN LOVE with Warhammer 40K I paint and play.
2. Motorcycles: I’m currently working on getting my license and talking about bikes.
3. Video Games: Always happy to chat about or play new releases. Currently playing BF6. But have a diverse library (PC gamer).
4. I also love the gym (weightlifting). Would love exchange workout splits.

Honestly, my biggest challenge is overcoming a bit of social anxiety and the fear of approaching people. I want to work on my conversational skills and just get better at meeting new friends!

I'd love to find people for casual meetups for coffee or a drink. Just talking and hanging out, and eventually exploring Gelderland or beyond. While I live in Apeldoorn, I’m totally happy traveling to meet up in surrounding cities or regions!

Drop me a message if any of that resonates with you tell me your favorite board game or what brought you to the Netherlands!

1pdylqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1pdylqp/how_i_start_how_i_do_this_how_i_do_that_here_is/,"How I start, how I do this, how I do that?? Here is how","I see a lot of “how do I start?”, “how do I do this?”, “how do I even pick a stock?” type posts here, so I figured I’d share the approach that made things finally click for me.

**A stock is just a tiny piece of a real business**. That’s it. If you were buying a neighborhood coffee shop, you’d want to know if it makes money, if customers come back, if costs are reasonable, and if the owner knows what they’re doing. Public companies work the same way, just bigger.

**Prices jump around constantly**, but it doesn’t mean the business changed overnight. Sometimes stocks go up or down because of earnings or news, but sometimes it’s literally just people getting excited or scared. Long term, prices tend to follow how the actual business performs. Short term, it’s mostly noise.

**Get honest about why you invest**. Is it for retirement? For fun? For something in a few years? Your time horizon basically tells you how much risk you can handle. If you need the money soon, you probably don’t want wild swings. If you’ve got decades, they don’t matter as much.

The other big thing is knowing yourself. Some people can watch their portfolio drop 20% and feel nothing. Others lose sleep over it. There’s no right or wrong, but it affects what you should buy. For me, **starting with simple, broad ETFs** made it way easier to stay sane. Once I felt comfortable, I slowly added a couple individual stocks I actually understood, instead of chasing whatever was trending.

On the “**how do you pick a stock?**” question: you really don’t need to know everything. I started with the absolute basics: does the company make money, does it grow, does it have cash left over after expenses, and am I paying a reasonable price for what I’m getting? You can get most of that from any basic financial website or the company’s own filings. You don’t need to be a pro to understand the general picture.

**Choosing a brokerage** was a lot less dramatic than I expected. I just picked one that was well-known, low fee, and easy to use. You don’t need 10 different apps. One good broker is enough. (I use IBKR).

The biggest thing that helped me was **consistency**. I stopped trying to guess the “right time” and just added money on a schedule. You end up caring less about daily price swings and more about long-term progress. It makes everything calmer.

And honestly, learning is the part that compounds. The more companies you look at, the better your instincts get.

If you’re just starting out, don’t feel like you need to be an expert on day one. Most people overthink it. **Keep it simple**, stay patient, and try to focus more on understanding the business than guessing charts.",4,1764850829.0,investingforbeginners,3,1.0,False

1pdyjyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP_Stories/comments/1pdyjyp/i_think_they_accidentally_gave_me_keter_access/,I think they accidentally gave me Keter access for a whole month and nobody noticed 😅,"Ok, this is going to sound like fanfic, but I swear it happened on my Site (or at least, I think so... I haven't been given amnestics yet 🤞).

I was a Safe class research assistant, first year, zero experience, minimum card rank, and my job was basically:
“Take these papers and don't break anything.”

Well, it turns out that the director of the facility (DEP) recently died, they cremated him and everything. So far nothing strange.

But one day I'm walking down a hallway that almost no one uses and I see a black card lying behind a flower pot.
I thought: “ah, a lost card from the laboratory, it must be level 2 or 3”.

NO.
It was a damn High Tier card. Category “why is a simple wizard touching this?”

But since I am a genius of the 21st century I thought:
“Well, I'll try it and see if it pulls.”

And he pulled.
He didn't just pull: he directly opened the Keter section for me.

⸻

So far so bad. But wait.

I am entering a forbidden hallway as if nothing had happened, when suddenly I run into the director of scientists, the most serious guy on the Site. The man looks at me, looks at my Safe class robe, looks at the Keter gate and his brain short-circuits.

Literal question:

“HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET ACCESS HERE?”

I just held up the card like it was my school ID and said:
“I found it behind a flower pot.”

I think for a second he thought I was lying, or that I was a spy, or that I was going to blow something up. But no... he just scolded me, told me to get out, and that's it.

But he didn't call security.
He didn't ask for paperwork.
He didn't report anything.
He didn't take my card.

So... I kept going.
What was I going to do? Not even an alarm sounded!

⸻

And yes... I took advantage of it 😅

Every work break I went to see experiments with the director of scientists.
He opened cameras, cut recordings, checked containment.

I didn't hurt anyone or anything, but I admit it was fun.
He was literally a Safe class assistant playing Keter investigator.

And no one said anything for a whole month.

⸻

Why did they take it away from me?

The official reason:

“Because you're already driving me crazy, kid.”

The real reason:

The director of scientists got tired of seeing me in places where I should NOT be.
So he grabbed the card…and burned it. Literal. 🔥

No paperwork.
No incident report.
No protocol.
Alone: ​​your adventure is over, champion.

In conclusion, it was a wonderful experience and if you have the opportunity to have a cup of coffee in restricted places, it tastes better, I recommend it.",1,1764850671.0,SCP_Stories,0,1.0,False
1pdyjpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/solar/comments/1pdyjpg/solar_install_tomorrow_in_the_cold/,"Solar install tomorrow, in the COLD!?","Hey installers, how do you deal with the cold? My installation is scheduled for tomorrow this is the weather production:

>A few snow showers scattered about the area in the morning, otherwise a good deal of clouds. A burst of heavy snow is expected. High 31F, low 24F. Winds light and variable. Chance of snow 30%.

I told my vendor next week when it will be in the 40s would be ok, but they plan to come tomorrow. A pallet of goodies and racking arrived yesterday.

I worked construction outside Chicago for a few years a couple of decades ago, and know how miserable it is to work in the cold. And I wasn't 20' up in the air. Is there anything I can do to make things more comfortable for the installers. I provided coffee and donuts for the roofers, they had fine weather. I have a propane space heater that puts out a ton of heat (which I haven't used in years), I could try to get it up in the attic, but as my TH has scissor rafters, I'd have to build a platform for it and I don't have any scraps laying around.

Also concerned about rack mount sealing materials functioning properly in the cold.

1pdyi23,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1pdyi23/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1764850504.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
