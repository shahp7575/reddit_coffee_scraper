Quick recap for anyone new:
My roommate got super drunk, tried to kiss me, I turned her down because she was wasted, then she hid from me for days out of embarrassment. Somehow everything turned around in less than a week and now we’re together.

(Full original post + previous updates here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/N1WyMis5Wp)

We told the roommates. They went crazy-happy, teasing us, cheering, the whole thing. She just stood there blushing into her coffee with the biggest smile she couldn’t hide.
Tuesday night — Mexican place by the river.
She knocked on my door looking unreal. I told her she was stunning (I am still shy saying stuff like that) and her face lit up like I’d given her the world. She said maybe this is the first I saw you complimenting something, haha.
Restaurant was packed because of the Christmas market, but we didn’t care. Tacos, margaritas, non-stop talking and laughing. After dinner we walked along the river again, found our quiet spot, sat wrapped in each other’s jackets, talked until the city was silent. She passed out on my shoulder and then I had to wake her up and went to our place.

Wednesday morning was free, so I asked if she wanted to watch a movie in my room. She said yes instantly.
Started some random film… it just lasted maybe ten minutes or 15 minutes. Then it was just cuddling, slow kisses, whispering until we fell asleep fully clothed. First unplanned sleepover.
Woke up with her head on my chest, hair everywhere, breathing soft against me. Lay there for a while just watching her sleep and feeling like the luckiest guy alive.
We’re taking the rest slow, no rush.
Probably going out again this weekend. Will keep you posted.
Still can’t believe the girl who was hiding from me a week ago is now the one I wake up holding.

Just wanted some outside opinions. I work from home on weekdays but on weekends I work at a brewery in my hometown. I see a lot of people I’ve known from high school I’m currently 34 now. one day this girl who I’ve known since high school came in she was surprised to see that I worked there, we have always hung out in same settings in the past because we had mutual friends. I was currently ending a relationship but was still in one.

She had ended up coming back the following weekend and once I got off my shift she was still there with some friends so decided to have my shift beers with her and catch up. She ended up confessing she always had a crush on me but she was aware I was in a relationship still. I had mentioned it was flattering but I vented that I was in the process of thinking about breaking up with my current gf because the relationship was going no where after being with her for so long.

This girl kept coming back to my work place every weekend just to see me for a couple of weekends after. After that I got sick and missed work for a couple weeks so I didn’t see her but she would message me on IG and ask if I was working and even invited me to go hang out with some mutual friends.

We ended up talking andtelling her that I do think she’s attractive but I can’t entertain anything until I conclude my current relationship and I just wanted to be respectful about everything. Fast forward  a month things ended with the relationship I was in.

Ended up messaging the girl that I’m single and that if she ever wanted to hang and get coffee and get to know each other better that it would be cool. She said that would be cool and now nothing haven’t seen or heard from her in anyway and just feels weird that she put all this energy in and then it just seemed to stop.

• Should I also propose grabbing a coffee afterward to catch up?

JUST DON'T THINK OF GIVING UP THIS ATTEMPT, wherever you are.

It's all in the mind ki yaad nhi aa rha, sab bhul gaya hu, kya likhunga paper mai, kaise hoga.
Sab yaad aane lagega paper mai jab baithoge ;). 
Isliye daro mat sab theek hoga, mast khao pio, padhai Karo, chai/coffee pio, gane suno, thodi moj masti kro, lekin padho bhi, jyada time nhi bacha hai.
Scanner's jroor dekho aur solve kro questions,  wrna topics yaad rhenge but paper mai shuru kaha se krna hai likhna kaise h nhi samajh ayega.

1. Jinka syllabus pending h ya start hi nhi kara to bhai sab cheezo ko maro goli, marathons lagao chapters kro, jab hojaye tab us chapter ka scanner kholkar Q/A read krlo 6-7 (1-2 solve bhi krlo) and repeat same for other chapters (Do important chapters first).

2. Jo revision kr rhe hai to karo bhai tumhara to shi hi chal rha hoga, lage rho aur ye scanner wala point yaad rkhna.

3. Do not skip any chapter, even aaj se pahle us se kuch pucha na gaya hoga, for example in JIGL - right to information act/ IT act, read krna is must taki exam mai question aaye to kuch to padha ho jo likh sko, time nhi hai to scanner se direct bhi kr skte ho.

4. 100% marks attempt is must, kaise bhi kro magar kro, jo bilkul samajh nhi aarha usko end mai kro jo bhi pucha hai uski definition bana skte ho to banado kuch bhi pata hai to likho obviously question se related hi likhna hai, isliye bola koi chapter skip nhi karna.

Ignore what other's are doing, go with your flow, koi 24 ghante padh rha ho tumhe us se koi matlab nhi, kisi ka 100th revision chal rha ho koi matlab nhi, tum kaha pr ho wo dekho aur us hisab se padho , study smart ;) give your 100%, 6-7 hour sleep is must. Again repeating mast khao pio, padhai Karo, chai/coffee pio, gane suno breaks mai, stress mat lo ho jayega.

ALL THE BEST🤞

Jao padhai Karo 
agar aur time hai toh..meri story se kuch motivation mile to lelo waise to bekar hi hai :)

Maine aajtak apna kabhi 100% syllabus even 80% bhi nhi kr paya hoga puri is journey mai, hamesha classes reh jate the fir vo at the end revision class ya marathons se jaise taise krta tha mental satisfaction ke liye tab bhi syllabus nhi hota tha pura, bas 1 revision proper exams se pahle jo bhi maine study kra classes se ya self study se.

I randomly started using a designated clutter table and it has helped me tidy up.

To provide extra seating for my family holiday party, I set up a temporary card table against a living room wall. 

After the party, I left the table there because, you know, ADHD. Each day after the party when I reset the living room I would put random or out of place things on the card table. 

If I didn't have the card table these random things would remain on the floor, or coffee table, or couch, or forgotten about in a basket because I don't have the energy or focus to put them in the correct place.  

Having a specific place to LAND random things keeps the momentum up when I'm doing a quick tidy. I don't need to re-home things right away, they can stay on the clutter table for a few days until I'm inspired to put them away. Placing them in a basket or in a cabinet would make them disappear forever. 

  
I'm surprised this working so well!

I am in the kitchen and looking for the scissors (I have multiple scissors scattered throughout the house and I don’t want to walk all the way back to the bedroom) when I see the pastry I took a bite of earlier but then realized that I wanted to eat with my coffee. Oh that’s right! I want coffee - WHERE IS MY COFFEE MUG? Oh it’s on the coffee table. Also on the coffee table is a coke can and bottle that needs to be cleared off. I take them to the sink, drain them, put them in the recycling. WHERE IS MY COFFEE MUG? Oh right, on the coffee table. I get my coffee, put it on the coffee table, sit down, pick up my project - I forgot the scissors. I go to the kitchen grab the scissors, sit back down, and see that the dog drank my coffee and splattered it all over the coffee table. I clean up the mess, and go without coffee. It’s fine (eye twitch). Sit down, cut the damned yarn (finally) and get through ONE STITCH before my other dog curls up in my lap. No, I will not move her, instead I’m ranting on Reddit.

1pe6y36,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pe6y36/aita_for_exposing_my_fiance_and_bridesmaids/,AITA for exposing my fiance and bridesmaid's affair at our rehearsal dinner by handing out printed texts to everyone?,"I called off my wedding 48 hours before the ceremony after finding a burner phone in my fiance's gym bag with months of texts planning to sleep with my bridesmaid ""one last time"" the night before we got married.

I'm 29, he's 31. We'd been together for four years, engaged for eight months. My bridesmaid is 27 and I've known her since college. I thought she was one of my closest friends.

Three weeks before the wedding, I was looking for his protein powder in his gym bag because mine ran out. Found a cheap Android phone tucked in the bottom pocket. It wasn't locked. The messages were all there.

Hundreds of them. Going back seven months. Right around when we got engaged.

The texts were disgusting. Talking about hotel rooms they'd met at. Saying how ""forbidden"" it made everything feel. How they'd have to be careful at the bachelorette party because people were watching them. And then the recent ones, talking about the rehearsal dinner and the wedding night.

She texted: ""one last time before you're officially locked down lol""

He replied: ""I'll tell her I'm staying at my brother's place after the rehearsal. meet me at the marriott on 5th""

I sat on our bedroom floor reading every single message. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone. They'd slept together at least a dozen times. In our bed while I was visiting my parents. In her apartment. In his car in some parking garage downtown.

I didn't confront him right away. I took screenshots of everything and sent them to my own phone. Then I put the burner back exactly where I found it.

For two days I acted completely normal. Smiled at the rehearsal planning. Confirmed details with the venue. Listened to him talk about how excited he was to marry me. The whole time I'm thinking about what I'm going to do.

My bridesmaid texted me during this time asking if I needed help with any last minute wedding stuff. I told her everything was perfect.

The rehearsal dinner was at this nice restaurant, about 60 people. Both our families, the wedding party, close friends. Everyone's dressed up, drinking champagne, giving toasts.

I waited until after my dad's speech. Then I stood up with my wine glass.

I said I wanted to share something special with everyone. I thanked them all for coming. Then I said I'd recently discovered something that changed everything.

I had printed out the screenshots. All of them. I'd made packets.

I started passing them around the tables.

My fiance's face went white immediately. My bridesmaid knocked over her drink standing up. She said ""wait"" really loud but I just kept handing out the papers.

People started reading them. You could hear the reactions spreading through the room. Gasps. Someone said ""oh my god."" My mom started crying.

My fiance tried to grab my arm. I pulled away and told him not to touch me.

He started saying it wasn't what it looked like. That the messages were taken out of context. My bridesmaid was just standing there frozen with her mouth open.

I told everyone the wedding was cancelled. I said I'd be keeping the honeymoon booking but changing it to my name only, since it was a trip to Iceland I'd been planning mostly by myself anyway and I'd paid for most of it with money my grandmother left me.

Then I walked out.

My phone started blowing up immediately. My fiance called 47 times that night. His mother showed up at my apartment at midnight screaming that I humiliated her son in front of everyone. I didn't open the door. His brother texted saying I was a vindictive bitch for airing everything publicly instead of handling it privately.

My bridesmaid sent this long message about how it ""just happened"" and they ""couldn't help their feelings"" and she was sorry but they'd ""fallen in love."" I blocked her.

Some of my relatives are saying I went too far with the public humiliation. That I should have just called off the wedding quietly. My aunt said printing out the texts and passing them around was ""cruel"" and now the whole family is embarrassed.

But they planned to sleep together the night before my wedding. They'd been lying to my face for seven months. She was going to stand next to me at the altar knowing what she'd done.

I left for Iceland yesterday. Changed the hotel booking to a single room. I'm sitting in Reykjavik right now drinking coffee and trying to process everything.

My sister says I handled it the only way that felt right and she's proud of me. But my mom keeps calling saying I should have given him a chance to explain, that maybe they can work it out.

I don't know. Maybe I should have just texted everyone that the wedding was off instead of doing it that way. Was I wrong?

I feel embarrassed even typing this out.

Everyone thinks I'm doing great. Good job, nice apartment, the degree my parents wanted. On paper I'm successful. In reality I've been stressing out for two years and I'm completely falling apart.

I was the gifted kid. Like, you know the type, typical asian kid. Straight A's, AP everything, valedictorian, full ride to a good school. Achievement was my whole personality (shoutout parents, thanks for pushing it upon me). I just did things their way and it worked out.

Got hired right out of college. My parents were so proud.

# But, I knew something deeply was wrong...

I dont even know when exactly. Maybe 18 months ago? Could've been longer. It happened so gradually I didn't notice until I was already drowning.

Now I wake up and the thought of opening my laptop makes me want to cry. I wake up at 9am to go to office, log on at 9:45am. Stare at Slack. Open an email. Read it four times without absorbing a single word. Make coffee. Scroll Twitter for an hour. Stare at a Google Doc. Move one sentence around. Its 3pm (i wish the day ends sooner).

Im legit doing the ***absolute bare minimum*** to not get fired and even that feels impossible.

I'm so fucking tired. All the time. But also this screaming anxiety that never stops.

thinking... I'm just lazy, right? My parents immigrated here and worked brutal hours so I could have opportunities and I'm wasting all of it. Sitting on my couch ordering Doordash for the third night in a row watching shows I'm not even paying attention to.

I dont feel sad exactly. I just feel... empty.  
I didn't think I was depressed. Depressed people are sad, right? I'm not sad...

# Everything I tried that made it worse

Therapy: helped me understand why I felt this way but didn't actually make me feel better

Antidepressants: took the edge off but made everything feel even more flat

Self care stuff: journaling felt performative af.

Meditation apps:  made me feel worse because I couldn't even focus for 10 minutes lol

Took time off work and just spiraled at home, came back feeling worse

Tried drinking more coffee which just made my heart race without giving me energy

My therapist suggested clinical depression. That scared me... like wtf... how is this depression if my life is just legit pointless.

# Pivotal point

Three months ago my friend posted pictures from her birthday dinner. I almost didnt go but forced myself since I'd bailed on her twice already.

Theres this one photo of everyone at the table. Everyones laughing, leaning in, looking alive.

I'm hunched over. Shoulders caved inward, built legit like a WATER bag... I look like I'm physically trying to disappear into my chair.

I stared at that photo for like 20 minutes. Thats not how I see myself in my head. In my head I'm just normal. But in that photo I looked defeated before anyone even spoke to me.

Then I remembered I've been sitting like that forever. Middle school I'd hunch over trying to be invisible. High school I'd walk with my head down and shoulders rounded. College I'd curl up in the back of lecture halls. I never didn't do any workouts either.

20 years of physically making myself smaller.

And I never stopped.

I started googling ""physical health depression links"" at like 2am and went down this rabbit hole. Theres actual research. Bad physique/no workouts increases cortisol (stress hormone), decreases serotonin and dopamine (the chemicals that make you feel human), keeps your nervous system stuck in fight mode.

Your body literally signals to your brain whether youre safe or not. And my body had been screaming "" EVERYTHING IS BAD"" for two decades.

# What actually fixed it

I decided to try something different. Instead of trying to fix my brain, I'd fix my body and see if my brain followed.

Committed to 8 weeks. Just to see what happened.

I researched everything about posture, muscle imbalances, and the body-mind connection. Turned out I had forward head posture, rounded shoulders, anterior pelvic tilt, weak upper back, tight hip flexors. My entire body was collapsed.

**STRENGTH TRAINING:**

* Rows - 3 sets of 12 reps, pulling my shoulders back into position
* Face pulls - targeting upper back and rear delts
* Glute bridges - 3 sets of 15, fixing my anterior pelvic tilt
* Planks - holding 30-60 seconds, building core strength to hold me upright
* Dead bugs - core stability so my spine could stay neutral
* Wall angels - shoulder mobility and strength
* Resistance band pull-aparts - throughout the day at my desk

The key: you need to be physically strong enough to CARRY YOURSELF. Your muscles have to hold you upright or youll just collapse back into that defeated position.

**STRETCHING (What was tight):**

* Hip flexor stretches - deep lunges, 2 minutes each side, morning and night
* Doorway chest stretches - opening up years of rounding forward
* Neck stretches - SCM and trap releases
* Cat-cow stretches - mobilizing my locked up spine
* Foam rolling upper back - every night before bed

**DAILY POSTURE HABITS:**

* Chin tucks throughout the day (felt dumb but worked incredibly well)
* Shoulder blade squeezes while working - every hour
* Fixed my entire desk setup - monitor at eye level, keyboard closer, better chair
* Started walking with my head up instead of staring at the ground
* Held my phone at eye level instead of looking down
* Set reminders to check my posture every 2 hours
* Using Upwise app for ai scans of my body

Tried a bunch of apps to fix my habits and mental state - Bend for stretching, Atomic Habits tracker, various journaling apps. All felt useless, just more tasks to fail at.

The only one that actually helped was using an app to address my posture specifically (upwise app).

**THE TIMELINE:**

Week 1-2: Sucked. My back muscles were so weak theyd get tired after 10 minutes of sitting upright. Sore and awkward constantly.

Week 3-4: Could breathe deeper. That constant tightness in my chest started easing. Still exhausted but slightly less heavy.

Week 5-6: Woke up one morning and didnt immediately dread existing. Not excited. Just neutral. That felt absolutely massive.

Week 7-8: Had actual energy for the first time in years. Started finishing work before 5pm. Texted friends back. Went to dinner without feeling like I was faking being alive.

People started treating me differently too. My boss gave me a bigger project, and a guy at a coffee shop struck up a conversation with me (hasnt happened in years, unbelievable).

Three months in now and its like I'm a different person:

* I walk into rooms without that crushing self-consciousness
* I can hold eye contact in conversations without looking away
* My voice sounds clearer and stronger (turns out good posture affects your vocal cords)
* I feel present in my body instead of trying to escape it
* People describe me as ""confident"" now when they never did before

Your body and brain arent separate systems. You cant think your way out of burnout if your body is stuck signaling danger.

Being physically collapsed keeps you mentally depressed. Its biochemical. Your body affects your hormones, your nervous system, your brain chemistry.

You need physical strength to hold yourself through life. Not huge muscles. Just enough strength to carry your own body without folding inward. When youre physically collapsed your brain thinks somethings wrong and keeps you in constant survival mode.

Confidence isnt a mental state you force. Its what naturally emerges when your body stops screaming ""SHIT SHIT SHIT"" at your brain 24/7.

# If youre burned out and nothings working

Take a photo of yourself sitting how you normally sit at your desk Look at it ***honestly***.

Are you collapsed? Head jutting forward? Shoulders caved in? Looking defeated?

Your body might be physically trapping you in this mental state.

Fix the body first. Build the strength to hold yourself.

changing the physical signals your body sends to your brain is LOWKEY THE GREATEST thing ever HAPPENED TO ME..

So I plan to leave my housing in January 2027!

I could so easily leave this coming January, But I really am trying to be good and save up more money to leave in January 2027!

I only get $80 a month. So I would be saving about half of that. I need $5 for body wash, $5 for shampoo, Monthly. Trying to stick to one bottle from dollar tree per week. Then we go out to eat once a month as a group, That’s about $20. Though I will try to cut that in half. I also try to go out to eat once a month with family too. So that is totally free.

I just calculated it and I will have $50 leftover. This means no more weekly trips to Dunkin and making more coffee at home. I can maybe spend $10 a month on coffee? At cheaper places like Cumberland Farms & McDonald’s iced coffee. So that leaves me with $40 a month. I’m just trying to think more realistically here. I’m sick this month so I may be able save up $80 until Christmas, Maybe $60. That’s if I’m able to go out.

I really wish I could save my whole $80. Which would be very nice. Some months I will try my best not to eat out with them, and only go with family. Just to save some extra money. I’ll be sure to make an update post about that.

I hope my plan sounds good.

  🎤 Apple Keynote 2025 — “The Freedom to Learn, Work, Live” (Soft music, low lights, Steve Jobs takes the stage in a black turtleneck and jeans) “Good evening.
It's an honor to be here today.
Today we won't talk about speed, nor about RAM, nor about cameras.
Today we will talk about freedom.” (Audience applauds) ￼ 1️⃣ Mac for Student — The MacBook that doesn't tie you down “Students don't have to think about computers. They have to think about ideas.
It's not the school that has to adapt to computers.
It is the computers that have to adapt to the school.” 🔋 Removable Graphene Battery + Instant Wireless Charging • The MacBook integrates a graphene battery, one week of real battery life.
	• The battery charges wirelessly instantly when connected to the school desk.
	• Each battery is removable: if it runs out, it is automatically replaced by iCloud Robots synchronized with the battery itself.
	• Zero worries, zero cables, zero waiting. 🌐 Features • Very light design like a MacBook Air
	• Portable, powerful, silent
	• Instant access to files and apps thanks to AI that anticipates use
	• Advanced VoiceOver for blind students “Technology bends to your life, not the other way around.” ￼ 2️⃣ Mac for Work — The MacBook that becomes a teacher (A MacBook integrated into the polished wooden teacher appears on stage) “Teachers don't have to adapt to technology.
Technology must adapt to teachers.” 🔋 Removable Graphene Battery + Instant Wireless Charging • Battery built into the bench, removable and automatically replaceable by the iCloud Robot.
	• One week autonomy with intense school use.
	• Instant wireless charging when your Mac is docked. 🧠 Smart Learning Memory • Apps and tools already open and ready as soon as the teacher enters.
	• Ready electronic register, automatic absence and attendance management.
	• SSD memory remembers the teacher's habits, anticipating every action. ☕ iCloud Machine of Café • Order coffee directly from your Mac.
	• Automatic preparation and heated container.
	• Sign in via Face ID or Touch ID.
	• Invisible technology that improves daily life. 🔄 Portability • The Mac detaches from the desk and becomes a normal MacBook Air to take home.
	• Instant reconnection to the school system when returning to the location. “It's not the teacher who has to understand the computer.
It is the computer that the teacher must understand.” ￼ 3️⃣ MacBook Liberty — Freedom without limits (Music intensifies, blue lights) “Apple has always been synonymous with choice.
But today we want to go further.
Total freedom. Without compromise.” 🔓 Total operating system freedom • Want macOS Now?
	• Do you want Windows? Right away.
	• Do you want Linux? Right away.
	• All in one MacBook, all optimized, all secure. 🧠 Predictive AI • MacBook remembers your preferences
	• Suggests the ideal configuration
	• Apps open before you ask
	• Everything synchronized without compromise “The Mac doesn't tell you what to do.
It lets you choose. Always."" ￼ 4️⃣ Final vision (Steve Jobs approaches the edge of the stage, silence) “Today we present not only new products.
Today we present a philosophy:
Computers that understand those who use them.
Computers that free up time and creativity.
Computers that make you feel free.” (The lights illuminate all the products on stage: Mac for Student, Mac for Work, MacBook Liberty) “This is the future of Apple.
This is the future for all of us.” ￼ 🌟 Final slogan: “Apple 2025 — Freedom to Learn. Freedom to Work. Freedom to Be.” ￼ If you want, I can make a further visual version with conceptual diagrams of: • removable graphene battery • instant wireless charging • automatic replacement via iCloud Robot In this way the keynote would become almost tangible and realistic, showing the public how the system works.

If you’re running the classic discovery - > demo flow (n mainly for mid-market), this is stupid simple but stupid effective.

Add a small tiny call with your champion between discovery and the demo - they call it bridge call. Takes zero effort but your demo conversion rate will look rigged.

I usually just ping my champion a couple days before the demo:

‘Hey, got 10 mins? Wanna run you through my demo plan real quick, just making sure it matches what you had in mind’

If they ghost you, that deal was already on life support, good to know early. But if they’re a real champion, they usually say yes immediately.

And that’s where the fun starts, outside the committee room people finally talk like humans. I’ve had champions literally hand me the cheat codes like what to show, how to pitch their own team,who’s gonna block, what objections are coming, which competitors are lurking etc.

*-6am*

I needed to use the water closet and fixed myself a coffee downstairs. I am perplexed by how odd it tastes. The bitterness is greater than before. Not even the sugar is making it better. 

Will discuss later. Must finish my account of last night. 

After supper, we were summoned to the drawing room, which I now saw had a roaring fireplace. At the center of the coffee table, I saw the surprise the Doctor was talking about. A large thin device of metal with what looked like a glass bowl for its base stood proudly and bewildered me with its ornaments. A long, tasseled leather hose stuck from its side and clay bowl wrapped in what looked like foil sat on top. There were hot coals from the fireplace atop that, and I realized that the base was filled with water. Before I could figure out its function, the doctor took the hose and inhaled. The base bubbled and like a magician, Weber produced a smoke ring out of thin air. I was sure I’d seen this before in a book somewhere, but was unsure exactly where. 

“A hookah!” exclaimed the professor. “I’ve never seen one in person before.”

“Not very common here in the states,” he said with a smile. “This, like the wine, is simply another one of my spoils of travel. Sit, if you please. I intend to share.” 

He handed the hose to the doctor who took it happily and puffed. He tried a smoke ring of his own, but to no avail. Then, he tried to hand it to me. I declined, but I do remember thinking the vapor smelled lovely. It was strange how tempting it was to me, considering I’m intolerant to tobacco on my best days- it always makes me sick. 

“Not even a try, Herr Manuel?” asked the Doctor. “I assure you its quite sweet.” 

“No,” I told him. “Thank you, but I’m fine.”  He offered me a cigar or pipe from his collection, but once more I insisted. Finally, with what I can only describe as a look of disappointment mixed with admiration, he grinned and moved on. 

He began to tell us about his time as an archeologist in Crete. Apparently he wrote several papers on the Minoan Language which has yet to be translated, though he assured us, he was closer than most. Crete is also where he bought the hookah, and he told us every detail- no matter how exhausting- about how difficult it was to transport. 

He also told us of his collection of books and the lengths he’d struggled to obtain some of them. I went on to ask him what his rarest book was, but he seemed hesitant to answer. 

“Rarity is a hard thing to measure, as with some of these copies, I don’t have a confirmed number on how many were ever made.”

“Then which one do you think, if any, do you have the only copy of.”

He fiddled with his bowtie as his face almost seemed to reach for an expression to disarm me. That same smile of his greeted me as he promised, “Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will show you, if you still desire, the rarest book I own.”

With that, Maxwell changed the topic. He was in noticeably better spirits than he’d been in the dining room and his face wasn’t even rosy from the crying. He mentioned how our own journey had gone and how strange the townsfolk of Portley had been to us. He brushed off the report with a wave of his hand.

“Yes, yes,” he said. “They’re quite new here and still learning. I’m sure they’ll be much nicer once you depart. They don’t get too many visitors, and I am their only doctor. I’m half surprised they don’t have an accent like mine given how often I interact with them!” He laughed at that, as did Maxwell, whose mind was already content with the answer. However, my mind was still chewing on that first sentence.

They’re “new,” and “still learning,” were not explanations I expected to hear. What does that even mean? I’m still bothered by it now. 

They continued to puff on the hookah until eventually, the doctor stood up and walked over to the fire. He was framed by the Greek moldings and victorian hearth that was only visible through the yellow filter of gaslight.  

“I suppose you are still curious about supper. Or, more specifically, what supper did to you. Am I correct?”	We both nodded, and he smirked. Pushing up his glasses in an almost theatrical fashion he spoke:

“I have a confession to make, my friends. I have not been completely up front with you about the full extent of my promise. Maxwell, I recall in my letter I said that the plant I had developed could change the shape of history? That it could rescue those starving in the hoovervilles and save the farmer from ruin?” Maxwell nodded eagerly, like a child to his sunday-school teacher. Weber strolled over and took the hookah hose from him. He took a long puff and blew several smoke rings into the chandelier above us. The vapor looked like passing ghosts from where I sat. Weber took another deep, laboring breath. 

“Fifteen years ago, this would have been impossible for me. I suffered, my young friends, from tuberculosis of the lungs. Every handkerchief I owned was flecked with crimson, and every movement I made was done through great pain.” He puffed again on the hookah. “You probably wonder why it is then that I can do such things. Why can I indulge such pleasures? I tell you now it is because of my discovery.” 

He pulled something round from his jacket pocket, about the size of a tennis ball. It was a weird flesh toned color, though what hue exactly was hard to tell in the amber light of the room. It was then I noticed just how impossibly smooth and round it was. It sat balanced, despite having no base, but did have one spot where it sank. A small green stem with a jagged leaf sprouted from its top. 

“Behold,” the doctor said, gesturing to the professor to touch it, “the Eden Fruit.” 

Maxwell picked it up and studied it, examining it as tenderly as a golden egg. I was mesmerized by the thing, but with a little more concern. It was such an odd looking fruit. 

“You see,” Weber said, “I’m an archeologist by trade, but with my worsening condition, I realized I need to turn to something less dusty and likely to make me cough, lest my death fall upon me like a viper. I turned to science. I looked for cures in chemistry, but found nothing. I looked into anatomy, searching for something to cut or scrape out, and still my efforts were in vain. I decided then, if not in medicines or surgeries, perhaps a cure could be derived from a more…. *Natural* source.” He pointed at the fruit in Maxwell’s hands. “After cross pollinating countless times, studying the effects of different herbs on the body, and after thousands of unsuccessful grafts, this is the result of my labors.” 

He walked over slowly and gently plucked the fruit from Maxwell’s hand. He then jerked his face toward me and extended the thing my way. 

“I insist you try it.” 

There was  something in the way he said it that almost made me shudder. He noticed.

“No?” he asked. “It’s perfectly safe. See?” He took a bite of the pink flesh himself and ripped a chunk away. What remained in its place was a large hole that revealed an interior so scarlet, I thought blood would ooze from it. It was like some demonic apple, and yet Weber appeared to savor it like it was the sweetest chocolate he’d ever tasted. He offered it to me again, but I still couldn’t do it. He merely shrugged at my denial and tossed it back to Maxwell, who barely hesitated to take a bite. He chewed for a moment before staring at it in wonder. 

“Peaches?” he wondered. “But sweeter, somehow?”

“Funny,” Weber replied, “I normally get bananas or figs.” He took a seat in an armchair closest to the fire. “Through much effort and experimentation, I have made the flavor malleable. It will take on the flavor a person merely wants it to have. For instance, if you bite it expecting fruit, you will most likely taste your favorite one. Is yours peaches, Maxwell?” 

The  professor nodded. 

“Excellent. It works a charm, even now in its fifth generation.” Before I could raise the question, he cut me off. “Over fifteen years, I have produced four other variants of this fruit. I am happy to say this is the strongest one. It not only can take the flavors of desired fruit, but also of other substances.” He looked at me. “Stew, per se.”

If I’d been able to throw up, I would have then. Being fed such a thing without my permission was one thing, but the illusion of its flavor and consistency unnerved me. I stared in wide eyed horror while the professor was clearly filled with amazement. 

“I apologize for the deception,” Weber said, raising an apologetic hand my way, “but I felt it was the easiest way to make you believe me. Thankfully I am a decent cook and you seemed none the wiser.”

“That’s completely unethical,” I told him. “What if we’d been allergic? Magic fruit or stew or whatever you want to call all of this… What if we’d died?”

“Oh, Herr Manuel,” he said, stroking his mustache. “You would not die from this. On the contrary. Look what wonders it has done for your body.”

I touched my throat as Maxwell burst out:

“You mean to say that this fruit-”

“Yes, professor, I do.” He gestured at the fruit with the hookah hose. “The same fruit that cured me of my tuberculosis is the same remedy that fixed Manuel’s aches and soothed your poor heart from despair.”

My blood ran cold as he said these things. Maxwell’s face finally looked more like mine than that of a gullible child, but there was still no suspicion. He tugged at the fringe of his beard as he rolled the fruit around in his hand. 

“How is any of this possible?” my mentor asked. I expected a sharp reply, but instead, there was a beat of thought. Weber stood to his feet at the fireplace crackled behind him and he licked his dry lips. 

“I fear I have overloaded your poor brains with too much information for one night,” he said. “I apologize for this. We may dive into the science of it all tomorrow, but for now, both of you need rest. Please, I’ll clean up once we’ve settled you in. No protest, now. I insist. If I continue to explain myself, you shall be a puddle of mush by morning. No, no. After breakfast I will take you to the orchard. For now, sleep awaits you. Gentlemen, please follow me.”

With that, he insisted Maxwell finish the fruit and he produced another one for myself from some pocket I couldn’t discern. He encouraged me to do the same when I preferred, insisting I would prefer eventually. 

With that, we were led to our bedrooms and given keys to our doors. He instructed us where the bathrooms were and where his bedroom was should we need him. Finally, he told us something that in my exhaustion I didn’t quite catch or understand, but now reflecting on it all, still startles me. 

“Please don’t go outside,” he said. “In places like this, with the shadows and the treeline as close as they are, the dark may play tricks on you. The wind may howl and your tired minds may get the better of you, but don’t fool yourself. Stay inside at night at all times, and don’t venture out without telling me.”

With that he shook our hands and bid us good night, though I struggled to sleep. For whatever reason, I’m still thinking of Marie. Perhaps it was because of the doctor’s wild story of tuberculosis- however untrue it may be. Or maybe its the crazier dream I can’t help having. If this fruit is all it’s made out to be, and all its properties are as Weber described, could it have helped you, Marie? My mother?

A strange thing happens as I write this. I find that the more I ache for you, Marie, the more I crave this devil-fruit on my desk. I don’t think it can help, but then again, I remember Maxwell. I am distraught at my own circumstances.

*-7am*

I took a bite. It tasted like strawberries. Those were always your favorite. Chest more relaxed. Head more clear. Heart still broken. 

\*-\**~~12:15 pm~~*

~~Imposimble~~

\-*2pm*

I feel that I need to control myself as I write because I fear my excitement may not allow for a clear explanation. I feel like I’m dreaming and if I don’t have this journal to look back on and keep my facts straight, I fear my story will get me locked away in some institution. It's the facts I need to focus on. The facts, Marie. Facts.

Here they are:

After my entry from this morning, I went downstairs once more to return the borrowed coffee cup and found the professor and doctor sitting in the drawing room once again- this time with cigars- discussing all sorts of academic matters. The professor was wearing a cable-knit sweater and his fedora sat comfortably on his crossed knee. The doctor, sitting opposite him on his lavish red velvet couch, was wearing a different shade of tweed and a necktie in place of his bowtie from the night before. It was just as colorful as the bowtie, however, and was adorned in a pattern of Turkish tulips. 

I know that’s what they were because that was exactly the topic they’d moved onto when I walked in. They laughed and slapped each other's shoulders as they talked about one odd encounter after another. Maxwell dropped a stub of ash on his sweater and almost lost his mind laughing. It was as if they were drunk without any of the symptoms of whiskey. 

Eventually, Weber stopped laughing and stood to his feet. He blew the smoke in his mouth into the silver chandelier that hung from a flaking gilded ceiling. Gold fluttered down like snow as the light breeze kissed it. I stared up in curiosity as Weber put a hand on my shoulder and laughed. 

“Forgive the decay of my home, Herr Manuel. The building we stand in was once home to a reclusive Prussian count by the name of Henrich Bastian. He came to this land in the 70s after the unification of my homeland and lived in moderate luxury and great disgrace. Bastian was disliked by chancellor Bismark, you understand, and for good reasons. On a drunken night, Bastian killed an army officer in the courtyard of a nobleman's house- one favored greatly by the army and deeply loved by one of Bismark’s cousins-'' He raised a hand to stop himself. 

“I ramble. The point of the matter is this: He fled the hangman’s rope on the first boat he could with as much gold and as many heirlooms as he could pack and built this manor in the middle of Georgia. You could say his sin- our murderous Cain, if you will- is what gives us such a lavish home in such a wilderness. Remnants of the man and his small family are everywhere. There! See? I keep a photo of him and his son next to the stairs.”

In the pale morning light that now filled the hallway, I did see what he was talking about. In the corner of the stairwell hung a tin-type portrait of a heavily mustached man standing beside a somber-looking woman in dark dress. Beneath them, unsmiling, was a young man no older than sixteen. He looked scared, to a degree, and there was some wetness about his eyes that gave me the impression he was a moment from breaking into tears. 

The professor’s wrinkled finger crept in at the corner of my vision. “The young man in the chair,” he said, “was Joseph Bastian. He was the one whose death secured my inheritance of this place.”

“You were related?” I asked him, a pang of sympathy besieging my heart. The look on his face was pitiful and mournful. 

“*Ja,*” he said, slipping into his mother tongue. “An amazing cultural exchange, it would seem. My mother, American by birth, moved to Germany to be closer to her distant relatives after losing her first husband to the American Civil War. A marriage in Berlin to a lawyer eventually led to me, and I grew up never knowing I had an aunt.” he pointed again. “That is her, next to the count. Frau Jennifer Bastian.” 

He puffed on his cigar as he took a few admiring steps towards the young man pictured. “Joseph- my dear unknown cousin- grew up in a world without me. We never had the chance to lean on each other. When I was in the trenches, facing Russian bullets and fleeing English tanks, I did not have his kind face to think of- for I imagine such a soft soul was kind. We never had the chance to discuss our lives. Never was a drink shared between us or a cigar passed. We never expressed the burdens of our families to each other- our fathers!” His eyes glazed over with haunted memories. “My father was cold, true. The count, however, was a hot-head and a drinker. How many bruises, I wonder, are hidden in such a portrait? Do I dare think of it?” He paused, as if actually considering the question, then sighed. “Indeed, I cannot help it.” 

I searched for a word to say, but was beaten by the professor. “How did the young man die, Doctor Weber?”

He kept his back to us in silence for several moments as cigar smoke rose from his tightened fist. 

“They say suicide,” he told us in a surprisingly quaint tone, “but I disagree. I believe it murder- even if not direct.” His gaze seemed to shift ever so slightly to the man standing above young Joseph. His fiery dead stare matched the doctor’s icy gaze. “If *Graf* Bastain is Cain, then young Joseph is Able…”

I almost went to comfort him when he spun around and tossed a hand over his shoulder, “That said, gentlemen, you did not come to hear of my family history, nor of murderous deeds and dead relatives. Come!” He immediately grabbed a pith safari cap from an almost explicitly hidden coat rack and placed it on his head. “I must show you my research and answer all of the questions you have from last night. We will venture out, visit the orchard, and then come back for lunch. Herr Manuel, once we’ve eaten and taken a rest- for you will want one, I assure you- I will show you the most prized book in my family’s collection. For now, come! Come, gentle friends. We must be off!” 

Professor Maxwell was already through the door, donning his coat and fedora as he went. He still had an almost puppy-like excitement that kept me from recognizing the man I’d come to know and admire for his stoicism. I still recall the long nights we spent together in his study, sparing over Aristotle and Marx. His eyes were sharper then, and untrusting. I’d worked for years beneath him just to get him comfortable enough to say my first name. He was like a tiger I’d befriended over months of slow and steady approach, working patiently and calmly enough that I could now pet him without fearing a bite. 

When you died, Marie, he was the only one who checked on me. 

Now, this mysterious doctor we’ve just met practically has him house-broken. I am perplexed to say the least. 

That said, I followed the pair closely out and followed them into the yard. I was almost stunned with how fast they were moving, given their age. In the gray light of day, I could now take in the expanding sage clearing that spread out for two acres around the hillside where we stood.  We were fenced in by an army of pine and holly trees that seemed to stretch the stratus clouds even thinner than they were. 

Weber was speeding along to an opening in the treeline, marked ominously by a dead poplar tree. A carpet of brown leaves wound down into a curving path, and the Doctor gestured to it like the Yellow Brick Road. 

“This way, gentle friends! The grove is only a half mile away.” He started down the path without looking back, completely confident in our obedience. He had no reason to worry, it seemed. We both took off after him, trying to keep pace with his surprisingly lively gait. (For such an old man, he moves like a fox!) 

I struggled myself to keep up with the two older men, as it appeared even the professor had more pep in his step than normal. 

I dare not wonder if it’s a result of the fruit. 

We ended up in another clearing before long, and discovered Weber, perfectly full of breath and free of exhaustion, puffing on the last bit of his cigar. He extinguished it on a patch of wet clay while Maxwell fanned himself with his hat and I loosened my tie. I had to pick a piece of pine straw out of my collar, along with a deer tick. 

“I am glad to see my old bones don’t slow down the young and healthy!” the old man laughed, straightening his tie. “Welcome, dear friends, to the grove.”

“Shall we see a specimen today then?” I asked, fanning my shirt against my chest. “One of the trees for this supposed miracle fruit of yours?”

“It is no miracle,” he said in a tone more serious than I expected. “I would thank you for remembering that much.”

His eyes grew darker for a hair of a second before resetting back to the same gentle face we’d grown accustomed to. I admit I almost jumped when he did so. I then got a soft look of reproach from the professor, who seemed offended on Weber’s behalf for my sharp comment.

“Now then, Maxwell,” he said, “He is simply tired from the jaunt over, is all. Let us come this way, I think and we shall see… Ah! Yes. Here is one!”

We followed him briefly around a cluster of shrubs and oak before taking in a sight that almost cost me my stomach. 

Before us, unlike anything I’ve ever seen, was a tree of medium height. Its bark was ruddy and firm, almost like that of a birch but smoother. I can’t compare the color in my head- Lord forgive me for thinking this- to anything other than the hue of dried blood. That alone was cause for alarm amongst the soft gray bodies of the vegetation around us, but as I took more of it in, I realized it was covered in *thorns*.

Even now I fear I underplay it in my writing. When I say it was covered in thorns, I don’t mean like that of a hawthorne or honeylocust. These thorns were all at least three inches long and pale at the tips, giving them the impression of horns or claws protruding from flesh. The leaves, likewise, were full, almost black in color, and surrounded on the perimeter by jagged points. By all accounts, they looked worse than decomposed. They looked *otherworldly*. 

“Here we have it, gentlemen,” Weber said, approaching the tree with admiration. “An infant, but still of use! Behold the *Verger* tree!” 

He raised his hand and suddenly I became aware of something weighing down the lowest branches. On the ends of some of the growths were masses of pink, fleshly buds, each at least the size of a golf ball. From each side of them, long tendrils covered in thorns draped down like willow leaves, scratching away at that topsoil as the wind swayed them. 	“Forgive the bareness of the tree,” Weber said, “This is where I harvested last. For dinner, you remember.”

My stomach was knotted up as the implications of such a plant became made known to me. I was sick, but at the same time had a hard time rationalizing why. As incredible as it was, science told me this was still just a tree and not something cast down from heaven. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about this plant. 

“You’ll notice gentlemen, that the soil around it is not generous with nutrients. In fact, it is nearly devoid of nutrients. Maxwell,” he said, with earnesty, “would you kindly take a look at this deposit here?” 

He pointed to a small patch of grainy, white soil not far from one of the veiny roots of the tree. Maxwell did as asked and bent down to examine it. He rubbed it between his fingers, sniffed it, and after a brief moment’s thought, placed some on his tongue. His eyes went wide as the flavor hit him.

“Why, it’s salt!” he said, almost gasping. “Salt and clay….” He looked at the doctor in amazement as the German spoke.

“A wonder, yes? Though a mistake on my part, to some degree.” He went up to the tree and plucked off one of the golf-ball fruits. “I was experimenting with soil compositions, trying hard to breed out a weakness inherent in the plant.” He bent down beside Maxwell and dropped the fleshy fruit into the deposit. I was stunned to see it almost immediately shrivel up and dry as the salt touched it. It was almost comical, like something from a picture-show. Unreal, yet so lifelike. 

“Salt seems to destroy the fruit almost immediately and stunts the growth of the trees,” he said, rising. “I salted this ground myself at great risk of my own horrible failure to prove its resiliency. This,” he said with a gesture, “is the tree and its fruit at its weakest.” We stood in silence as we contemplated last night’s dinner. “As you can see, even crippled, the tree can perform wonders.”

“A tree with fruit like that, that can grow nearly anywhere….” Maxwell’s face regained the sharpness I was used to, if only briefly, as his mind wandered into the realm of possibilities. 

“Wait,” I said, breaking his wonder, “If this is the species at its lowest and contained, then what does it look like at its height?”

It was then Weber gave me an almost devilish smile, and one that tried hard to hide any malice. He clapped me on the shoulder, and softly told me, “ask, my friend, and you shall receive.” 

With that he turned around and gestured us along another path, away from the sapling.

 (I can’t believe I can call it that, but I’m running out of words to describe it.)

Maxwell’s face was still swimming with thought as we followed the doctor. Through the crackling of leaves and twigs beneath our feet, I could swear I could hear him muttering. I even think it was a name. 

I hardly had time to speculate. 

“You probably wonder how it is that this plant lives if not through nutrient-rich soil, sunlight, and water,” Weber said, his back to us, pacing along like a specter in the thicket. He made almost no sound upon the leaves as he walked. “It is a strange matter, is it not?”

“I’d say it is,” I told him.

“Your mind has no doubt wondered about it since my demonstration back there, Herr Manuel,” he said. “That said, I must ask- as my mind slips- have I asked you about your german? How well do you know it?” 

“You have not and I know little outside of ‘please,’ ‘thank you,’ and, ‘where is the bathroom?’” 

“Hmmm,” he said, slowing his pace. “I have a dictionary back at the house that should help you. Learn the meaning of *verger* and then I believe you will come to understand. For now, I will leave you with Latin. I believe that will suffice. Yes….” He stopped and faced me with a dark glint in his eye. “*Natura vindicat*.”

“Nature…” I said as I stumbled through my roots. “Nature… nature *reclaims*?”

He smiled at me. 

“Very good,” he said. “Now let us examine this principle in action, shall we?”  
  
We rounded into another clearing where the soil once again became bare, though unlike the last patch, this one was dark and rich. My eyes weren’t on the ground for long, however, as they were soon drawn to the sight of \*it\*.  
  
Before us, towering over every tree in the vicinity, was a \*Wünger.\* It stood at least forty to fifty feet tall, with each of its rust-red limbs stretching out like a toothy web overhead of us. Long, sinewy vines of thorns and black leaves wove through the tops of surrounding oaks and firs with impunity, stretching off into nowhere. I almost dropped my journal as I took it in.   
  
I tried writing something down earlier about it, but I couldn’t even process what I saw into words. I can barely process it now.   
  
Marie, there were living things caught up in that tree’s thorns. Struggling things. Spaced out like flies in a spiderweb, there were squirrels, various birds, mice, even what looked like a fox impaled upon those horn-like growths. The leaves around us were speckled with crimson and I swear I could hear the labored breaths of those suffering creatures above us.   
  
Just when I thought my horror couldn’t grow, Weber whistled at me and Maxwell. I’m relieved to write that the sight of this monstrosity seemed to shock him just as much as it did me, but neither of us were prepared for what we saw next.  
  
Weber was standing a few yards away from us, pointing down at a blob of pink that was almost the size of a toddler. A huge fleshy melon, free of blemish or bruising, sat at his feet. A long conical branch connected it to the tree and several of those sharp tentacles splayed out around it.   
  
I puked.   
  
“I apologize, Herr Manuel,” Weber said, offering me a handkerchief that Maxwell had to pass me. I couldn’t bear to look up and risk seeing that thing again.   
  
“It is a lot to take in at first,” he said, “and I do truly apologize for not properly warning you. You see,” he said pointing toward one of the entangled, bleeding animals above us, “the species is carnivorous, not unlike the venus flytrap. It survives such harsh conditions because for reasons I have yet to discern, it grows just as well on blood as it does on water and sunlight. That said, it’s parasitic nature and the size of its unharvested fruits- such as this one here…” He thumped the melon with his thumb and forefinger, creating a noise that almost made me puke again. “Well, you understand why I harvested from the lesser and not the greater.”   
  
He crossed the distance and laid a caring hand on my back. “I know. I know. Nature, Herr Manuel is a fickle and oftentimes cruel thing. \*Mien Gott\*, if you could even read of the nature of animals in the wild, you would soon understand this is not even among its greatest horrors. Penguins, dolphins, cats, even the simple duck! All of them are guilty of atrocities greater than this, I assure you.”  
  
I eventually steadied myself and regained my posture, leading the good doctor to giving me a firm pat on my back. Maxwell, however, was still looking at the melon. He started to reach out for it, slowly, before Weber snapped, “No, Maxwell!”   
  
With incredible speed, he took hold of the professor’s wrist and pulled him to his feet. There was a strained silence and concerned gaze passed between the two of them before Weber finally let go.   
  
“I-I,” he stuttered as he adjusted his glasses, “I’m sorry, my friend. It’s just that this tree… Well, it gives one cause for concern. Please, if you ever see fruit larger than your fist, do not touch it. The thorns can be tricky and by the time a fruit is \*this\* large, it is no longer ripe.”  
  
“Why is there only one fruit on this tree?” Maxwell asked, his eyes wandering around the surrounding area. “Should there not be more?”  
  
“I imagine there are,” said Weber, “but the nature of the vines and my harvesting habits leave it hard to find any fruits simply lying around. With the size of this, and the other trees, it’s hard to say where they’ll pop up.”  
  
“Others?” I found myself saying. Weber nodded.   
  
“There are three other trees, like this one,” he said, “though I doubt they’re as big.”  
  
I’d be lying if I said my blood didn’t run cold. That tree, its fruit, the nature of its survival, all terrified me.   
  
I wished and still do hope to be back in Virginia soon. The Georgia isles can wait. I simply wish to be back home.   
  
We traveled back after that, and, despite the horror we’d both experienced, Maxwell was once again casually talking to Weber about logistics. They prattled on about giving lectures on the fruit. On the profits, both financially and socially, of this discovery. They talked of aiding starving families, of emptying children’s hospitals, and ending cancer. They spoke of Utopia, but I could only see Hell. I still do. Every time I think of that tree, I shudder.   
  
Even now, I hold back. I’m looking over my shoulder as I write this. Weber should be arriving at my door any minute now. He wishes to show me his most valuable book, but I’m concerned at what this might entail. None of his surprises have been good so far.   
  
Enough. I shall write this last thing and leave it be for now, just for the sake of my nerves. It couldn’t have been right, and I’m sure my eyes were playing tricks on me, but while traveling back to the house, I checked the path behind us and saw something moving in the brush.   
  
I got separated from the others for a brief moment, so only I witnessed this, but out of the woods, walking along the path, there came a deer.   
  
It was an eight-point buck, fit with a speckled mane and white tail. This alone wasn’t what startled me, but what was on it did. Growing around the antlers, tangled and menacing, were little black vines and leaves. Any thorns they had were invisible to me, and they did not disappear when I rubbed my eyes. What was not invisible was the rabbit in its mouth.  
  
Like some wild dog, this stag had a bloodied rabbit hanging from its almost unnaturally wide jaws. It almost looked like it had fangs, but I was too far away to tell. I swear, I feel mad just writing this down, but it looked at me, Marie.

I can’t get its eyes out of my head. They were leaking some black, viscous substance that crusted against its fur. 

Without warning, it fled back into the woods, carrying the rabbit with it. I still don’t know what to make of it, but if it’s real, then what? Why did it look like part of the tree? Or vice versa? I must have been hallucinating. I must have. 

Marie, I can’t help but think of those words Weber told me.

I was looking for a table for my new apartment. It’s so unique, and when it was delivered, the thrift store owner had asked to ChatGPT what their value is and apparently the chairs go far between $700 and $900 each. I want to get them appraised in person though because I’m not gonna rely on chatGPT. 

Anyway, my apartment is very colorful and bordering on millennial maximalist. I like to trace a flow of colors patterns and textures throughout. I’m not sure what to do with this, and the blank white wall behind it. I’m down to hang something from the ceiling, the walls, wallpaper, a small rug because I don’t want it to bleed into the coffee bar area across the way, whatever. I just need to find a way to make this area feel like its own unique area in the apartment.

Xmas has me worried because we will be traveling again. It's like I went feral with the food because there were days I was eating 4k cals plus (KFC if you are wondering how)

I don't know if I got it out of my system and that was just pent up stress over the last 12 weeks but I'm ready to get back to it.

*August 22:*

Doctor Weber takes care to keep himself hidden from public life. It’s been three days since we passed Raleigh, and I fear it will be another day still before we make it out of the Blue Ridge and into the Piedmont. Professor Maxwell tells me that patience is a virtue and that before we know it, we’ll be nestled comfortably back home in Virginia, richer than Midas and more revered than Solomon. I dare not point out that half the reason it’s taken us so long to make it down south is that he insisted on driving us down, missing the turn in Spartansburg, and leading us down a mountain path instead of the coastline I was so excited to see.   
  
I mustn't be so critical of my mentor, however. Such an accomplished scientist would rarely take his assistant to an almost literal goldmine of discovery. He hasn’t told me much of this Professor Weber. Only whatever he has developed in his greenhouse could change the course of not only our lives but the lives of every starving American living in Hoovervilles and working long weeks for the sake of a quarter. 

I believe he lost a poor relative to starvation sometime last year, though I do not know the conditions surrounding it. I do recall his melancholic state and how often bourbon glasses surrounded his desk. I often heard him muttering a name over and over in his liquor dreams, though male or female I have no clue. 

What I do know is that the man I sit next to now is not that man. Here, in this truck, his blue eyes transfixed on the road, I see a man of firm resolve. The beard he’s grown in the last few months makes him look like a prospector shoved into a suit. His bowtie is scrappy as is his mood. He hasn’t even stopped to ask what I’m writing but has occasionally gone off on winded stories of how he and his family traveled through these hills often when he was a young boy. He alludes to having a sibling of some sort but drops them from conversation as soon as they’re brought up.   
  
I read once that a Spanish explorer traversed this area in search of gold and glory. He died somewhere in the South I believe. However, I am certain that if his spirit lives on, it is in the heart of my dear mentor.   
  
  
  
The road grows bumpy and it’s becoming harder to write. Will resume on smoother ground.   
  
  
  
\*12pm- or thereabouts:\*  
  
The oddest people live in this region. Though not unkind, they are certainly a peculiar bunch. We have stopped off at a roadside gas station and drugstore, and a small barbecue hut within walking distance of the place has given me a picnic table to pen my remaining thoughts. After I ate, one of the waitresses- I believe that’s what she is at least- approached me and asked where I was heading. I told her that I was a botanist and that my mentor and I were traveling on business. I was able to point out the professor to her from my seat. He was leaning against the truck, smoking a cigar, and apparently in his own conversation with a clean-shaven man in overalls. Judging by their points and gestures, it was most likely for directions.   
  
She gave him an odd look, then wiped her hand on her apron. She was older than both of us by the look of her, with curly white hair tucked neatly under a paper cap. Her clothes had the occasional grease stain and her makeup was smudged from what I could only imagine was the heat of a kitchen, and yet she stared at us both as if we were tramps in a department store.   
  
“Where you folks headin’ again?” she asked.   
  
“I forget the name exactly,” I told her, “but I believe its name is something like ‘Portley’ or a place near there.”  
  
Her expression changed from confused disdain to wide-eyed concern. She almost dropped her ticket book as she spun around and took a seat next to me.   
  
“Listen here, son,” she told me, “Ifin it is Portley you’re going, I suggest you and your professor fella turn right on around and go back to wherever it was you come.”  
  
I protested, saying we’d already traveled all this way, and followed by asking what it was that had her so scared. She shook her head and said:  
  
“They ain't right up there. They just ain’t. Every once in a while, one of their ilk comes through on the way to Augusta or Athens or someplace like that, but every time they do there’s trouble.”  
  
She went on to mutter something about the way they move or talk, but she shook herself and coughed. When she stopped, she pulled out something from her pocket and placed it on the table near my paper plate. 	

“My family was one of the last catholic families in this region before they got tired of driving an hour to the nearest church every Sunday and converted to Baptist. Ifin you’re headin’ that way, you’ll want this.”

The object was a cheap rosary that was missing more than a few beads and bore a metal cross long since smudged from bright bronze to dull gold. It was brighter around the base, meaning someone had once committed regularly to hold it and pray the creed with it, making their mount cavalry out of a fist and bent knees. It was clearly a family heirloom, and one I tried to refuse, but the woman would have none of it.  
  
“Take it, by God, and by God may it either serve you or convince you to go back. The devil walks the earth, boy, and in Georgia his home is Portley. Anything or anyone there is not worth your soul.”  
  
I wanted to ask her more, but before I knew it, she was gone and the door to the hut was slammed shut. The sliding order door was closed immeadiately after and I was left alone at my picnic bench, surrounded by the goliath pines and oaks that spread out like an ocean around me. I find myself thumbing through the beads remaining on the rosary, reliving a bit of my childhood and more than likely disappointing my poor late mother as I stumble through them. I cannot help but think of the waitress’ words as I write.   
  
This cross reminds me of the rosary Marie once had.  
  
The professor approaches.   
  
  
  
\*Addendum:\*  
  
It seems my mentor was able to secure directions and we are now back in the car heading towards Portley. I haven’t mentioned anything to him about the rosary or the things the waitress said. However, I have noticed something concerning as we stumble into the growing dusk. There is now an old black bible seated between us. When I asked the professor where he’d gotten it, he laughed.   
  
“It’s the damnedest thing, John,” he said. “The gas station owner gave me directions then ran back inside to grab this. He shoved it on me and refused to take it back. Superstitious bunch down here.”  
  
I faked a laugh and he didn’t seem to notice. All is quiet now, but the closer we draw to the doctor’s house and the life-changing development he’s made in his reclusive home, I’m nervous.   
  
Must sleep it off.   
  
  
  
\*7:25 PM\*  
  
I am stirred awake by the roughness of the road. There is a pain in my neck from the angle I placed my head and my vision is hazy. \~\~I am filled with-\~\~  
  
I am tired.   
  
The professor is still awake but is not up for conversation- thus why I’m writing in my journal for the fourth time in a day. What he has said is that Portley is within the next ten miles, according to the directions the gas station owner gave us. I look forward to a bed, all concerns aside, and pray the doctor has food waiting for us. 

I have a pain in my throat now that makes me cough regularly. The professor isn’t noticeably bothered by this and has only said, “allergies,” in response to my racket. The pain and the coughing make me think of Marie. Her condition and loss still haunt me, it seems. Her, my mother… I fear I have a curse on me that causes women to die.

I cannot wait to have tea or coffee. Anything hot to make this go down and to shove those ideas out of my mind.   
  
I see a road sign coming up on our right.  
  
Finally,   
  
  
  
\*August 23- close to 5 AM:\*  
  
I have much to write despite it being so early. I’m struggling to rationalize and place all of the events from the latter half of my journey with what logically makes sense, so I think this is the best way to lay it all out.   
  
I find myself holding the rosary in my other hand while I write, but I can’t say solidly as to why.   
  
I’ll start with our entry.  
  
When we made it into town, I started to find myself disillusioned with the fears the waitress and gas station owner had so thoroughly tried to instill in me. The buildings were sparse, and the main road of the town was lined with very few stores. There were occasional houses and one or two plots that looked like small farms, but nothing overtly stood out. 

There were not many people out, most likely due to the time of night, but there were some. A group of men in their suspenders and work shirts huddled around a tiny of a storefront, resting on metal chairs and smoking their pipes and cigarettes. I could smell the cheap tobacco from the truck, and I still find its odor on my cardigan. 

From what I was told, I half expected them to throw bottles or rocks as we rode through the street. I expected a gun or knife to greet our tires or at least angry screams. None of that happened. They did the opposite. They waved at us.   
  
As I write that, I fear I underplay the effect it had on me. When I say they \*waived\* at us, I mean \*they\* waived at us. Every single one of them. Five men were in that group in total, and as soon as we passed by, every single one raised their (right?) hand, waved, and smiled.   
  
The professor waved back at them, but I could tell from his grip on the steering wheel, this bothered him too.   
  
We passed by a woman walking in a very rigid fashion, almost painfully erect in her posture, and she did the same. Same hand. Broad smile.   
  
It was when passing what looked like the county sheriff’s office, we were greeted by a dark-haired man in a tan deputy's uniform. He too waved and smiled, but lowered them as he stepped down from his perch on the sidewalk and approached the curb. The professor slowed the car down and- albeit reluctantly- rolled the window down.   
  
Taking the man in, I was shocked by how smooth his skin was and by how energetic he looked on what I could only assume was the tail-end of a long shift. I had an idea as to how his voice would sound this far down South, and almost jokingly wondered to myself if we’d even be able to understand him.   
  
Imagine how red my cheeks became as he spoke not only without an accent but almost impossibly proper English. I couldn’t begin to place a speech pattern. I still can’t, though the voice is still fresh in my mind.  
  
“Hello there,” he said. “Where are you from?”  
  
The professor explained we were heading to the residence of Doctor Andre Weber and if he had any directions. He didn’t drop his smile as he said:  
  
“Oh yes! Doctor Andre. He is indeed a very good doctor. He will no doubt expect you. You cannot keep him waiting.” 

There was an awkward pause before the professor asked again where his residence was, reading the address from our telegram that had invited us there in the first place.  I expected to hear another tight response but was more startled when the deputy shot his hand up and gestured down a right turn. He did not say any other direction besides this. The professor thanked him, prompting a, “It is my pleasure! Please enjoy your time in Portley!” but nothing else. 

His hand did not drop as he did this. 

We drove away and as we did, I noticed the deputy staring at us from the side-view mirror. He dropped his arm almost mechanically and turned sharply on his heels before walking away. He did so in the same fashion as the woman we’d seen before. 

“Friendly people,” Professor Maxwell said.

 I remember laughing, but not for the humor of it all. Another detail I noticed, just as the main road faded from view, was that the back sides of the buildings- though their fronts were pristine- were covered in thick blankets of ivy and Kudzu.  I do not know what to make of this, nor why it bothers me so much. I will write more about this later if my mind can make sense of it.

We spent another twenty minutes driving through the growing dark as cedar and oak trees loomed over us with long branches that reminded me of fingers. Each one bent unnaturally and scrapped against the roof of the truck. The road didn’t grow sturdier either, and at one point it was so rough I was convinced that we were going to pop a tire on some sharp rock or another. I would have worried about deer or other passing animals as well if I wasn’t so dazed from the jostling and neck pain I wrote of earlier. 

Winding road after winding road went on until finally, like some specter rising from the grave, the silhouette of a manor house came into view. In a large clearing where the land merged into a grand winding hill, the sharp treeline was conquered by the rising point of a roof. The amber lights of lit windows came into view and before I could process the magnitude of this large two-story house that sat strangely out of place in the middle of the Georgia woods, we were already parking in the driveway. 

“Finally!” Maxwell said, putting the truck in park. “I thought for sure we’d miss it.”

“Are you sure this is it?” I asked him. I know that sounds like a stupid question in retrospect, but I believe it was brought about by the unease that had settled into my system from the encounters we had in the town. I also still can’t shake the feeling of decay and overgrowth that lingers in the whole house. In the dark, I could see no discernable thing wrong with its face. However, the sides of the building were overrun with blossoming vines and ivy that outstretched to the wood paneling from the trellises. There was a wild look to it all, and even now as I write, I notice the fingers of Kudzu scratching at the base of my windowsill. 

I digress. 

We traversed the dry staircase that led to the front door and went to ring the bell, but the door swung open. I almost jumped, but was immediately disarmed when a small man in a tweed suit greeted us. 

He had a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and wore a slightly crooked and brightly colored bowtie. He sported a thick mustache that put my own to shame and, despite having very recessed pale temples, a thick mane of curly white hair that brushed his shoulders and collar. I expected a staunch and reserved greeting in that similar painful voice the deputy had given us back in town but to my pleasant alarm, he was downright jovial.

“It must be professor Maxwell I see before me!” he exclaimed, clasping my mentor's hand and shaking it vigorously. “I have eagerly awaited your arrival and now here you are! A blessing from… from… Well let's not dive into that. It is too late in the evening to discuss theology. I am Herr Weber-” I was still taking in his charming German accent when he turned to me and looked me up and down. He reminded me of a curious crow as he cocked his head to the side and mused to himself. 

“And who might this be?” he asked, though more to himself than anyone else.

“Johnathan Manuel,” I said, reaching out a hand. “It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

He stared at my hand for a beat, only moving his eyes and his face devoid of a smile. For a moment I was worried I had done something to offend him in some way. I jumped when his straight face burst into a wide laughing grin and he took my hand. His flesh was almost alarmingly rigid and cold, but his personality was anything but. 

“Herr Manuel. The pleasure of acquaintance is all mine. For when I thought I’d only be receiving one guest to this lonesome hill, I’ve been blessed with two! It’s practically a party!”

“Forgive me for the surprise guest, Dr. Weber,” said the professor. “The journey was simply too long to make by myself and I was concerned for my safety. That and- if I may be so bold to say in a company such as this- John is a dear friend despite my advantage in years. I trust him as I do my own family.”

For a moment I thought he almost said brother. 

“There is no apology needed. I agree, the distance is great, but I believe your time here will be worth it. I trust you’ve read my letter?” 

My mentor nodded gravely and his tone seemed to grow tense as he leaned in to speak. “The claims you make are great, and I am desperate. Can you please-”

It was then I embarrassingly let out a wet, hacking cough that resulted in something flying from my mouth. It landed on the floorboards of the front porch, and my cheeks grew red. 

“I’m so sorry-” I told them. “I picked something up on the road, it seems. I cannot begin to-”

“Hush, my boy!” The doctor took me by the shoulder and had me open my mouth. He examined the back of my throat and said, “As I suspected! An allergy attack. The pollen here is extreme most days. Oh, your poor throat must be writhing!” He pointed a finger back to the professor and wagged it at him. “We will discuss further over supper, Maxwell. Believe me when I say that not only are my claims true, but they are greater than you can even imagine. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a stew that I think our young friend will find most agreeable. Please, gentlemen. Inside!”

From there we were led inside the house. I can speak with certainty, now that it is daylight, but at the time I was perplexed with the house. Its interior was Victorian, with old gilded foil flaking off of the molding. There were glass display cases showing knives, pieces of pottery, and papers so old, I thought a mere glance could turn them to dust. The ceiling was high in the main hall, and I saw an open drawing room off to the side with lovely quilted armchairs. The walls were lined with books, which set my mind spinning with excitement. There was also a strange towering device made of glass and metal in the center of the table, but I did not recognize what it was. 

“This way, gentlemen,” he said, leading us to a door on the left. “I have much to discuss with you, and plenty of food for you to eat. Please!” 

As we entered the dining room, he gestured us to a set of chairs nestled into a fine mahogany table. In the center of its face, resting on a linen runner, there was a large silver dome covering a platter. From a china cabinet behind us, he nabbed another plate and bowl, along with an extra spoon. He sat them down in front of me with care.

“Gentlemen,” he said, gripping the top of the dome. “I give you a stew that will change your lives forever.” The professor laughed, but the doctor did not. I suppressed a cough, but Weber did not seem to notice as he turned to my mentor with a voracious eye. I half expected a reprimand, but instead:	“What ails you, Professor Maxwell?” The professor looked confused by the issue. “I say, what ails you? What causes you pain?”

“I’m afraid I don’t understand, Dr. Weber.”

“It is a simple enough question,” he said, brushing his mustache with a stubby hand. “Our young friend here, at the present, suffers from pains in the throat with no ready medicine for his condition. Therefore, I ask you, what is it that ails you?”

“Nothing in particular, sir.” At that, he flashed me a look of concern and amusement, almost as if he’d been stopped in the street by a crazed beggar. 

“We are all afflicted,” said the doctor. “Whether we admit it or not.”

“But I have no wounds!” 

There was a long stare between the two of them. The only movement in the room was the flickering of the candelabras and the trembling of a vase of tulips. Then, with an almost sinister flare, the doctor smiled. “Not all afflictions can be seen, and not all pains are wounds. Think of this as you eat, Herr Maxwell.”

He removed the cover and revealed a large bowl of amber stew, full of carrots, corn, potatoes and meat I believe was beef. He used a small ladle and filled our bowls, then exited the room briefly, leaving us alone with our food. Up close, it looked odd to me. Oil floated in the broth, and the vegetables looked as if they’d been submerged for a long while. It looked almost mushy when looking at it too long. I looked up to see the professor's reaction, but to my alarm he was staring at the bowl, wide eyed and troubled. 

Dr. Weber appeared with a  bottle of red wine, and exclaimed, “Multipulciano!” He had already uncorked the bottle and was generously filling our glasses as we sat. “I fell in love with this wine while studying in Italy. I bought enough to last a lifetime- though I hope I outlive the wine!” He laughed heartily, but by himself. Once he sat down, he gestured for us to eat, and reluctantly we did. 

I am astonished at how nervous I was at the time. I was merely eating soup, and yet I recall my hand trembling as I raised the spoon to my lips. Those first few seconds of taste were nonexistent as I slurped down the broth, but my senses were reawakened as I took in a flavor that reminded me of a soup from my childhood. My mother made a soup that tasted exactly like this, down to the spices she’d thrown in sometimes at random, but always tasting lovely. 

There was no doubt, despite my odd circumstances. This was my mother’s stew. How that could be, I had no idea, but it was. The only odd thing I found was that it was devoid of salt. For moments I would think that there was a hint somewhere, but for some reason I could tell there wasn’t. I looked up to ask the professor, expecting to interrupt his meal, but he was actually watching us. His bowl was as full as his smile, and he raised his eyebrows in delight as I asked him for a salt shaker. 

“Apologies,” he said, raising both hands in surrender, “but I’m afraid I don’t keep salt in the house. Sodium doesn’t like me, you understand.”  

I almost made a comment about how odd that was, and turned to see my professor's reaction, but he wasn’t listening. Instead, he was crying softly, his bearded face inches from the bowl. I saw a tear roll of his nose and drop into the soup.

“Professor Maxwell,” I asked, “are you okay?” 

“Of course he is,” answered the Doctor as he learned back in his carved chair. “He’s simply healing. Aren’t you, sir?” He looked up with a red face of astonishment. His wet cheeks were wiped by the sleeve of his jacket, and his smile was like that of a terminally ill man being told he was cured. 

“I don’t understand,” he said. “What is this doing to me?”

“I’d like to know the same!” I interjected, “This stew tastes… I mean it’s just like the one-”

“How is your throat, my young friend?” 

It was then I realized my throat was no longer in pain. I inhaled an incredulous breath and was shocked at the clarity of my throat. I couldn’t even muster a response before the Doctor interrupted again. 

“I imagine your neck must feel better too.” 

He was right about that as well. Any pains and aches from travel I held had vanished from my body. I was relaxed, somehow, and my muscles were invigorated. As I write this now, I find myself wondering:

Did I ever mention the pain in my neck?

If I did, I would have forgotten it. For now, I’ll chock up Weber’s comment to nothing more than observation. Still….

Without elaborating, the doctor stood to his feet and said, “My friends, please finish eating. I have a surprise in the drawing room for when you finish, but for now, eat. Eat, and be healed! There is still much to discuss before bed.”

And with that, he left us and we were left alone. I stared at my bowl for a second, trying to rationalize the flavors I tasted with what I saw, but was unsuccessful. I looked at Maxwell to find some kindred spirit, but it was useless. He was already pouring himself another bowl.",1,1764870526.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

And one day i proposed to her. She said yes and we married the same day that she agreed. I promised to her that i will love her for eternity. We built a big two story house. We lived. We were inseparable. I really loved her. I was falling asleep in her warm hug every night. We were planning for a kid, we dreamed of peaceful life with each other. But she began to fade, her memory started weakening. She forgot how we met, slowly she started forgetting who i am. And suddenly one day i woke up not in her warm hugs, but in my old bed, in my old flat. I don’t know how to feel. The first week i drank a lot. I still cannot forget her beautiful smile, her warm hands and kind eyes. I remember that I promised to buy her a coffee machine. I can’t help but to cry. I talked to my psychologist, she said that i will eventually forget. But I can’t, it’s been almost 5 months after this dream happened, and she still lives in my head.

I’m so excited for them, and it’s 2 days a week! So I think they are going to catch on SOOO quick. You know how quick I catch onto things? Man they both catch on so quick. M is already reading. R could be a swimming star. 

Here’s the creed they say before every class for karate, which is one of the reasons I was really drawn to this activity for the girls over another, and to this studio. It’s small and newer and feels like family. And I need family. And by god I’m building it with real people. (Not that I know anyone there. But it doesn’t feel established enough yet where I would feel on the outside looking in. It’s the one next to my favorite coffee shop in which you have been forbidden :-p lol) 

——

I will develop myself in a positive manner and avoid anything that would reduce my mental growth or my physical health.

I will develop self discipline in order to bring out the best in myself and others.

I will use common sense before self defense, and never be abusive or offensive.

This is a Black Belt School.
We are dedicated.
We are motivated.
We are on a quest to be our best.

Winners never quit.
Quitters never win.

He backed up a bit leaving the bag when I opened the door and I took it away (i felt pretty guilty taking food from a squirrel but it was a pastry and coffee which are obviously both bad for squirrels) so I reordered my coffee (idk how much he touched my old one haha) but this time with apple slices instead of a pastry. 

I waited at the door this time to make sure to beat my new friend to the bag and left out one apple slice for him. But he is nowhere to be seen, is there a chance he’ll come back? I’m sure another hungry critter will come along and take it if not, but I really wanted to replace the food for him.

1pe6dxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1pe6dxc/entire_team_laid_off_and_rto/,"Entire team laid off, and RTO","TL;DR - I stayed in a dying group because I felt an obligation to my team (and in exchange for money), and now I'm the only one left.

I am a director reporting to a VP. Our business has been declining and my team of 10 had dropped to two direct reports plus one dotted-line report. The group was spread across four different cities, and two people moved under managers in another office, while four people either left or got let go, and one guy died of cancer a couple of years ago.

All information and decisions dead end at my boss, so none of his direct reports have any input on organizational issues.

I knew one of my directs would be let go, but I came in on Monday to find out that my other direct report and the dotted line guy are gone as well. So after 12 years as a manager in this company, I no longer am. I also have no resources to pick up the work the employees who got let go we're doing.

I'm now the last person left from the group in the office I'm in. I've been working two days/week in office for years (even prior to 2020) as have most of the other people in the broader group. Technically my boss is in this office but he's rarely there, and doesn't want to tell anyone where he is. (He once went to South America on vacation and didn't tell us.)

So as of Monday, I now have to be in the office 4 days/week. There isn't a single other person that I can collaborate with because the teams I deal with are in Asia.

My boss, ever the motivator, told me that this was ""an opportunity"", and that I should be sitting at my desk more, on the off chance he has some work for me.

Obviously under normal circumstances, I'd just pull the plug, but I took this job for the money, knowing it had a lot of bizarre bs. Anyways, I'm a highly-compensated coffee badger, at least until next year's layoffs roll around.",27,1764870059.0,managers,6,1.0,False

We got a whole load of people who have hard situations in their lives and they're afraid of making bad dicisions and they come here, which is totally fine.

Totally fine **as long as it doesn't connect with mental health** in *any* way. Which should be obvious, right?

I wish. To all people who are saying if killing themselfs or seeing a therapist is a sin, PLEASE DON'T WAIT AND ASK FOR HELP.   
For a moment, please stop caring about God, because for some this may be so underwhelming that it makes the pressure even worse. Focus on yourself, talk with someone trusted, make your favorite coffee or tea and try to relax. 

Asking God for help is not bad, **but it's not enough.** I promise you, he won't be mad that you're taking care of yourself; in fact, he's very happy that you're still trying and ypu keep going.

I've also typed up a set of cutscenes that would be played and unlocked as the Season progresses.

**New Home:**

Cutscene:

Fade in on a view of the Saints Ship flying through space.

 

Jane Austin: It's been a while since the Saints defeated Zinyak, and a lot has changed. Keith David created a new government to make peace between the remaining Humans and Zin, Asha and Matt formed a new secret service, after King’s second book was such a success, he adapted his two books into several movies, with the Boss becoming his executive director to make sure they didn't turn into the same disaster as “Gangsta's In Space”. But there were still a few Saints who stayed loyal to the cause of finding a new home.

 

Cut to the Bridge of the Saints Ship, where Gat walks in to join Kinzie, Shaundi, and Pierce.

 

Gat: You found us a new home yet? I'm getting tired of just sitting around all the time.

 

Kinzie: If you thinky job is so easy, then why don't you take over?

 

Gat: Sounds like you need a coffee, I'll go to the kitchen.

 

Pierce: Ain't there some way we can just build a new home? The Zin have a lot of advanced tech.

 

Shaundi: Oh yeah, Pierce. What are we supposed to do? Take one of Zinyak’s Simulations and just 3D print it into existance? Great plan.

 

Kinzie: Wait, that's perfect.

 

Shaundi: It is?

 

Kinzie: Nano technology. We can take the simulation file, and use Nano-tech to build it.

 

Pierce: I knew it.

 

Kinzie: Great plan Shaundi.

 

Kinzie gets to work.

 

Pierce: What!? That was my idea!

 

Gat: Sounds like you're just jealous to me.

 

Kinzie: Ok, here we go.

 

Shaundi: You're finished already?

 

Kinzie: You're surprised?

 

Outside the ship, the Nano-tech starts building a replica of Earth, but something goes wrong. Cut back to the Bridge where everything is flashing red.

 

Kinzie: Uh oh, that's not good.

 

Pierce: What did you do?

 

Kinzie: I don't know.

 

CID: It appears you selected all the Simulation files, instead of just one. Now the Nano-tech is struggling to know which blueprints to follow.

 

Gat: This is gonna get messy.

 

CID: Indeed.

 

The Nano-tech starts building frantically, then suddenly the Saints Ship starts getting pulled down to the new planet.

 

Kinzie: Brace for impact!

 

Cut to them all waking up to find the ship in ruins on a small island nearby a large island that looks to have elements of Stilwater, Steelport, and Fortnite rolled into one.

 

Shaundi: Stilwater looks kinda different.

 

Pierce: Nah, that's Steelport, right?

 

Kinzie: CID, head out there and scan the area, see what you can find out.

 

CID: I am on my way.

 

Show a montage of gameplay featuring CID as players Sidekick, then cut to CID returning to the Saints.

 

Gat: So, where are we? Stilwater, or Steelport?

 

CID: Both. With elements of some other location that I'm struggling to identify.

 

Kinzie: Need some help?

 

CID: If you don't mind.

 

Gat: Yeah, I'll head out too.

 

Kinzie: Oh no you don't. I want to gather as much data about this place as possible before you start blowing everything up.

 

Gat: Fine, have it your way.

**Party Time:**

Cutscene:

Open with Pierce, Shaundi, and Gat relaxing in a makeshift base made from the wreckage.

 

Pierce: I hate all this waiting around. Why can't something exciting ever happen?

 

Shaundi: Oh, right. Because creating an entire planet, then crash landing on it wasn't exciting enough.

 

Kinzie glides back down to the Saints from her Oppressor.

 

Kinzie: I could use some help out there. Pierce, you free to join me?

 

Pierce: Aw man, can't we just send the Boss in there?

 

Gat: The Boss is working on King's new movie. We gotta do our own leg work now.

 

Shaundi: Also, weren't you just complaining about nothing exciting happening?

 

Kinzie: Come on, Pierce. There's music and dancing?

 

Pierce: Ok, now you're talking. Let's get it started!

 

Show a montage of gameplay featuring Pierce, Kinzie, and CID. With Pierce and Kinzie using their Emotes, Gliders, and Pickaxes. It ends with Maero showing up as a Mini Boss and fighting them. Cut back to Shaundi and Gat as Kinzie and Pierce glide back to them.

 

Gat: So, how's it looking out there?

 

Pierce: Maero showed up.

 

Gat: What?

 

Shaundi: Are you serious?

 

Kinzie: I guess the Nano-tech also generated the human files too.

 

Gat: Ok, but what's with this giant banana?

 

Pan to the left of Gat to show a guy in a Banana Mascot suit, who just waves at them.

 

Peely Ned: Hi, I'm Peely Ned.

 

CID: Just like the two cities, the Chicken Ned File was blended with another file.

 

Gat: Great. So now we've got talking fruit roaming the city.

 

Kinzie: Don't worry. I'm sure we can find a way to fix everything.

 

CID: Highly doubtful.

Pierce: Are you sure this place is important?

 

Kinzie: It might be.

 

Pierce: Real encouraging.

 

Shaundi falls in through the ceiling.

 

Kinzie: Shaundi!?

 

Pierce: What are you doing here!?

 

Shaundi: You guys have been out here for a while now. Thought I'd check in and lend a hand.

 

Kinzie: I just need a little more data. You two keep hostiles off me while I finish up.

 

Shaundi: You got it.

 

Show a montage of gameplay featuring Pierce and Shaundi defending Kinzie (using her “Inner Sanctum” Emote) with CID in tow. It ends with Dane Vogel showing up as a Mini Boss and fighting them. Cut back to all the Saints gathered at the Crash Site Base. Kinzie has built a custom pod.

 

Gat: What exactly are you doing right now?

 

Kinzie: Well, if the Nano-tech can use simulated people against us, why can't we do the same?

 

Kinzie activates the pod.

 

Everyone stands back as the pod glows brighter and shakes, until at stops and the pod opens. Once the fog clears, Lin steps out of the pod.

 

Gat: Lin!?

 

Pierce: I don't believe it.

Kinzie: Ok, we'll be able to gather more data if we split up.

 

Pierce: Sounds good.

 

Shaundi: Let's go.

Pierce and Peely Ned are just dancing in Saints HQ. It ends with Cyrus Temple showing up as a Mini Boss and fighting them. Lin gets thrown into the lake by Cyrus. Cut to Kinzie, Pierce, and Shaundi returning to the Crash Site Base, where Gat is waiting for them.

 

Gat: So, how'd it go?

 

Shaundi: Oh it went great. Absolutely perfect.

 

Pierce: Lin ended up at the bottom of a lake… Again.

 

CID: I'll set up the pod again.

 

Kinzie: But, I've almost got all the information I need on what the third simulation is that's meshed with our two cities.

Cutscene:

Pierce: Kinzie! Are you two done yet!?

 

CID: These things take time.

 

Kinzie: CID’s right. We need to do this right. Besides, I'm sure you three can hold them off a little longer.

 

Suddenly Lin is thrown through the air, passed Kinzie, and lands in the ocean. Kinzie turns around to see Peelfessor Genki with his Genki Bat stood in front of Pierce and Shaundi.

 

Shaundi: This can't be good.

 

Suddenly Gat steps passed Pierce and Shaundi and faces Genki.

 

Gat: Play time’s over. I'm taking charge. It's our time now, let's get this started.

**Grand Finale:**

Cutscene:

The Saints are all helping Kinzie build a big machine.

 

Pierce: What's this for again?

 

Kinzie: It's to fix the errors made by the Nano-tech.

 

CID: It will restore all 3 locations to their original designs.

 

Gat: Oh, cool. No offence, but Stilwater and Steelport do not mix well together.

 

Shaundi: Agreed.

 

Suddenly the Nano-tech renders a giant version of Zinyak, who immediately steps on the machine, destroying it and knocking back all the Saints.

 

Shaundi: Well, so much for that idea.

 

Kinzie: Go to plan B.

 

Pierce: What's plan B?

 

Kinzie: Johnny…

 

Gat: Shoot and destroy.

 

Show a montage of gameplay featuring all the Saints running to Planet Saints, they all re-emerge in their Saints outfits. Then, accompanied by Peely Ned, they all charge at Zinyak and battle him. Cut to the Saints all exhausted and chilling in Saints HQ.

About 6 months ago she broke up with me in Barcelona. Even in the breakup she was already split in half. Saying things like “I don’t know if I’m making a big mistake”, “this city will always remind me of you”, crying, all of that. It was not a clean “I’m done, I don’t love you”. It was “I have to go” mixed with “maybe I’m wrong” and ""you're my closest person"" etc etc.. the usual mixed signals.

I left, went back to my country, tried to swallow it “like a man”, as I keep telling myself. Then the pattern started.

After a few weeks she reached out. Sweet videos, messages saying she misses me, sharing emotional stuff, talking about our mutual friend who passed away, all in this really warm intimate tone. I told her I couldn’t just slide into some soft, undefined contact because I still had feelings and it confused the hell out of me. I asked what she actually wanted. She basically refused to answer clearly, said stuff like “we both need time to heal and grow, maybe in another place, another time, in truth we can meet again” and “I love you, it’s not from lack of love, you have to trust that”. So: big words, big feelings, zero decision.

I suggested no contact for a while so I could breathe. She agreed with “if that’s what you need, I’m here if you ever want to talk” kind of thing. Again: putting it on my “need”, not owning anything.

Then she broke no contact. Birthday message, then later asking to catch up. Calls, long talks. Still very warm. At some point we had what I call the “regret call”. She told me she had talked about me with her therapist. That I was basically exactly what she wanted and needed on paper. That she had tried dating but “it wasn’t her”, that she couldn’t do it with others, that she was terrified of getting close to me again but still loved me. She literally said she regretted how she did things and that she ran away when she shouldn’t have. She sent me videos about attachment styles. Fearful avoidant was mentioned. So of course my brain went “ok, so there’s love, there’s regret, there’s fear… maybe there is something to work with if we go slowly and honestly”.

Then nothing really concrete happened. She's super warm and regretful, I took it calmly.. she went totally distant again. 

Fast forward: Four weeks afterwards I visit the city again recently. She asks me to meet, not just for a coffee but to come out to the beach town where she lives now, see her studio, hang out like we used to. We spend time together, it’s gentle and intimate, she’s touchy, we talk openly about the relationship and what went wrong, wanted to do intimate things like rollerblading down town etc, she asks if I’m seeing someone, I say no, I ask her, she says no. At the end she tells me she loves me, that she cares, I kiss her hand and leave calmly. I go home thinking “ok, there is something still alive here, but I won’t chase it”.

And then the classic: after that meeting she is suddenly colder. She’s been watching all my stories instantly, liking everything, sending emojis. Then after I ask if we can have a proper talk to clear the air and get some clarity, she starts avoiding even opening my stories, goes distant, replies more like a detached analyst than a woman in love. I can literally see the switch from emotional to hyper-analytical. It screams dysregulated and scared to me, but I still don’t know if I’m just projecting attachment-theory stuff onto it.

We finally had that talk yesterday. Two calls, bunch of texts.

I went in calm and honest. I told her I wasn’t there to pressure her into a relationship or decision, just to stop living in this weird grey area where she says big things and then disappears. I said the last months had been confusing, that the pattern of warm and then cold was messing with my head because I still have feelings. I named specific things: regret call, “you’re exactly what I want”, “I love you”, the invitation to Ocata, the songs she posted, asking if I was dating, all that, and then the distance after. I tried really hard not to attack her, just to say “this is how it lands on me”.

Her position was basically: she can’t choose me, she can’t do relationship now, she doesn’t want to hurt me more, she cares a lot about me, she doesn’t want to send mixed signals, she understands if I need distance. A lot of “I understand if you need this” and “maybe it’s better so I stop questioning my decision and wondering if I did things differently”. So again: it sounds self-aware, but it still dodges actually owning “I didn’t want to be with you enough to try”. She never once clearly said “I don’t want you”. It was always “I can’t”.

After the call we texted and it annoyed me even more. She wrote things like “I don’t want to keep a hopeful thread of maybe that interferes with your life or my life. Either it was a mistake or a necessary action, maybe both in a weird way” and “I understand if you need real distance. Maybe it’s better for me too so I stop questioning my decision”. Those “maybe”, “what if” and “I understand if you need” just triggered the hell out of me, because in my body they are the mixed signals themselves. It felt like she was making it sound like this is all my “need for clarity” rather than her inability to stand behind anything concrete.

At some point I snapped. Not screaming, but I finally got properly angry. I told her she never really takes responsibility for the impact of her behaviour. That she makes decisions from fear and then hides behind fate and destiny and “what’s meant to be will be”. I literally told her this is how people in their late 30s end up alone and call it “cosmic spiritual fate truth blablabla” instead of looking at their own patterns. I went through example after example of how she reached out to me, how she said she regretted, how she said she loved me and that I was exactly what she wanted, how she pulled me back into contact after I had gone no contact and was building my life, and how she then refused again to act on any of that. I said “this isn’t me being needy, this is you pulling me back and then not doing anything with it”.

I told her I couldn’t keep living in this loop. That I refuse to be kept as some fantasy “maybe in another time” person. That if she can’t and won’t look at this honestly with me and actually try, then I’m closing the door and I need distance for a long time. I did not leave it vague. I said I’m done.

Her last messages were basically “I understand, I will respect your decision, thank you for being honest, I hope you put a period to our story, I don’t want to involve you in my process anymore”. Which again somehow framed it like I’m the one who needed to do the final full stop. No “I’m sorry”, no “I see how much I hurt you”. Just this slightly spiritual, detached acceptance.

Now I’m here. Completely heartbroken. Again. This time it feels more final than the actual breakup, because now I feel like I lost even the fantasy. I did what I know a healthy person is supposed to do: set a boundary, refuse limbo, call out the pattern, choose myself. I’m proud of that part. But the other part of me is devastated and keeps asking:

was I totally blind and reading way too much into her words and actions these last months?

were those actually mixed signals or was it just me interpreting everything in a hopeful way because I still loved her?

is this just classic fearful avoidant bullshit or is it simply that she doesn’t love me enough and I should shut up and accept that?

did I do the right thing by calling her out so hard and closing it, or did I just blow up something that might have slowly resolved on its own if I’d stayed in touch?

and the stupid question I hate myself for asking: is there realistically any chance someone like this ever comes back from their own growth and genuinely takes responsibility and tries again, or do I need to treat this as 100 percent over and stop even entertaining that thought?

I know the “right” answer is probably to assume it’s over, focus on myself, let go of hope, etc. I get all the theory. But I’m in that phase where my brain is trying to rebuild the story of what actually happened so I don’t feel like a complete idiot for the last six months.

So if you’ve dated someone like this, or been the avoidant one who later realised what you’d done, I’d really appreciate a reality check. Was I actually reading clear mixed signals? Did the way I finally ended it sound reasonable to you? What helped you stop running mental simulations of “maybe she’ll understand one day and come back?""

I don’t need sugarcoating. I need people who have been there to tell me how it really is.

1pe66dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1pe66dx/is_he_interested_in_me/,Is he interested in me?,"I'm writing this on a throwaway account because, to be honest, it's a little bit embarrassing. I matched with a guy on Hinge last month. He asked if I was free that day, but I wasn’t, so I asked if he wanted to take me out. He said yes, and I told him I’d be free that Sunday. He replied, “Let’s do something then.” I asked what he wanted to do, and he didn’t answer for over two weeks. I just forgot about the conversation and didn’t expect anything to happen.
But a few weeks ago I went into the city to grab some shopping when he suddenly asked me if I was feeling spontaneous. I had makeup on, a nice outfit, and my hair looked alright, so I said sure—why not? We happened to be in the same place at the same time. We met up and grabbed something to eat. He paid, and the conversation went really well. He compared me to a singer he really likes and told me to take it as a compliment because “she’s gorgeous.”
Afterwards, I suggested getting a drink together. He said he had some beer back at his place and that we could chill there, and honestly the vibe was so nice that I agreed. We went back to his apartment (which was honestly beautiful and had an amazing view of Berlin). He played piano for me, introduced me to his roommate, and then we drank together. He kissed me, and we hooked up.
He was very sweet. We showered together, he cuddled me, kept kissing me, and kept telling me how much he loved my body. I honestly thought it was just going to be a one-night stand until he suggested getting coffee together the next day. We did, and we also got something to eat. He said it was a perfect morning.
He dropped me at the U-Bahn station, he went to work, and I went home. I texted him and asked if he wanted to come to my place, and he seemed excited and said he’d love to. This is where the mixed signals begin.
We agreed he would come over that Friday since he said he had no work, and I didn’t work the next day, so he could sleep over. I even told him I was buying groceries to cook for him and asked if he wanted anything in particular. He said I was cute and that I could cook anything I wanted. His replies were a bit slow, but nothing too crazy—because when he did respond, he was very chatty and usually asked how I was doing.
When I texted him to confirm Friday, he suddenly said his best friend was visiting from his hometown and that he also needed to go to work. I was very confused because he never mentioned this before, and when we made the plans, he said he wouldn’t be working on Friday. He claimed it was spur-of-the-moment. His friend was supposed to come on Thursday, but then he told me he was actually free on Thursday because he and his friend rescheduled. So he came over on Thursday instead.
When he came over, I didn’t ask too many questions about the mix-up because I didn’t want him to think I was crazy. I cooked for him, we slept together, and he even took photos of the food and of me “for memories.”
In the morning, we kissed, and he was very touchy and cuddly on the S-Bahn. He even kissed me on the lips when saying goodbye.
After that, he didn’t respond for a day, but then we met up on Tuesday. He cooked for me, we watched a movie, and we slept together. Afterward, we went to his balcony, listened to music, and had a really good conversation—it was pretty romantic. We fell asleep cuddling and kissing. The next day, we got something to eat again, talked, and had a nice lunch.
But the previous night, I saw a Hinge chat pop up on his phone, and the last time we were together, he was getting Bumble notifications, and I also saw the Tinder app on his phone. Is it just out of habit? I mean, I still have Hinge on my phone, but I paused my account.
Why are his replies so slow? And why does he never ask me out first? I’m always the one asking him. But then again, someone who just wants sex wouldn’t put in this much effort, right?

Fast forward a couple months and I asked her out for coffee, she said no lol. She said that she just recently got out of a 4 year relationship and isn’t on the market right now. (Which I can understand, but also don’t know if that was just an easy way of letting me down). Anyways, we still talk all the time, she even apologized for being abrupt when she rejected me and said she’d love to hang out as friends but she doesn’t see herself dating anytime soon…that was last week. Since then we still talk all the time, make each other die laughing, and we are always smiling whenever we talk. She mentioned that she was gonna start training for marathons with a sick girl (F18) that she takes care of as part of another job, and since I wanted to do the same I offered to be a training partner, but she said it’ll probably be a no since they wanted it to be a girls thing.

I’m just confused, two times I’ve tried to hang out with her and have been shot down, of course I want a relationship but I equally want a friendship, I just can’t tell if she meant it when she said she wanted to be friends or was just letting me down easy. Even though she has rejected me twice she still talks to me all the time, still laughs with me, and even starts the conversations. I guess the main question i need help with is if I should still try and build something with her (whether it’s friendship or more), or if I should just cut my losses and give up.

Looking for good conversations, shared curiosity & maybe something real.","Recently shifted to Delhi and I’m living on my own  in a rented flat. Just me, my routine, and the occasional internal debate about whether chai is better than coffee (Coffee wins, most days). I’m currently upskilling, reading a lot, and freelancing while building myself professionally. 

Ambitious, yes but not in the “burnout is a flex” way.

I believe good things especially relationships happen when two people first slow down enough to actually know each other. No rush, no labels on day one. Compatibility isn’t found; it’s built.

A bit about me:

Age: 28

Location: Delhi (and genuinely excited to explore it properly)

Career: Ambitious, focused, and self-driven. I enjoy working on myself and where I’m headed.

Finances: Financially stable, no loans, no drama, peace of mind matters to me.

Lifestyle: I adore fitness and do chill and smoke green sometimes.

Personality: Calm, thoughtful, slightly sarcastic, values emotional maturity and clear communication.

I enjoy cafes, quiet places, long conversations that accidentally turn deep, and exploring a city with someone who notices small things. I’m the kind of person who believes companionship should make life feel lighter, not heavier.

What I’m not doing here:
•  Not looking to rush into anything.
•  Not asking for instant romance.
•  Not pretending to be mysterious or unavailable.

What I am open to:
Getting to know someone organically. Talking. Laughing. Seeing if values, pace of life, and ambition align. And if they do we’ll figure out the rest together.

If you’re someone in Delhi who’s also building a life, curious , emotionally available, and believes connection > convenience we might just get along.

Icebreaker:
If you could spend one day in Delhi exactly the way you like it no obligations. What would it look like?

1pe624w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pe624w,"Luxury boutique bliss-The Vasilicos, Santorini","Overview:
A chubby little gem you won’t easily stumble across and not on any travel agents portal. 

The Vasilicos is a former family home converted by the owner into a true luxury boutique hotel. My husband saw it in Condé Nast, and we have had it on our list ever since. Only 7 suites total, 24-hour concierge, and staff that you genuinely get to know by name. They go out of their way for you without being overbearing. Most importantly, it’s completely removed from the chaos of Oia crowds and the cruise ship madness in Fira. We had friends stay in Oia a few days after us and they ended up hating Santorini due to the crowds. 

All the pictures except the first one of the hotel entrance were taken from or in our room. The views 🤤

Timeline:
Mid-September for 3 nights.

Weather:
Absolutely perfect. Warm, sunny days. Chilly enough at night for a light sweater. Some days had very strong winds.

Location:
Located in Imerovigli. Super convenient and peaceful. Away from the crowds, yet still walkable to tons of restaurants of all price points within 20 minutes. The hotel is right by the Oia-to-Fira walking trail, so we did different portions of the hike each day straight from the property.

Room:
We stayed in the Efta Honeymoon Suite. It’s one of the smaller of the 7 rooms, but still very spacious. It has a completely private plunge pool. There are a lot of steps down to the room, which adds to the privacy, but it’s something to note.
Included in the rate:
	•	Pillow menu
	•	Breakfast
	•	Airport transfers

We paid about $800/night. I would not recommend this room if you struggle with stairs. By “some stairs” I mean roughly 30–50 steps down to the room 😊

They also have:
	•	Larger suites with bigger plunge pools
	•	3 rooms that don’t have private plunge pools but instead walk straight out to the main pool

Staff:
Incredible. Truly didn’t lift a finger once we arrived. They carried our luggage all the way down and back up those stairs without hesitation. They offered help with everything from dinner reservations to excursion planning and always followed through.

Excursions:
We did one excursion — a winery experience run by the owner’s brother. Highly, highly recommend. Wine and food pairing lunch was phenomenal and felt very personal, not touristy.
From talking to other guests, they’ll also arrange:
	•	Private boat charters
	•	Beach clubs
	•	Custom island itineraries
They really handle all the planning if you want them to.

Food & Beverage:
Breakfast was included and delivered to your room. Simple, fresh, delicious but nothing crazy. Everything is homemade or locally sourced. We asked for hard-boiled eggs daily and they happily added them.
We also ordered:
	•	A bottle of sparkling wine to the room
	•	Cocktails (including during sunset)

Everything was excellent and felt thoughtfully done.

Mishaps:
Very minor and nothing that affected our overall experience.
	•	They kept asking if we’d be okay with a later breakfast delivery time. We didn’t mind, but we did want coffee earlier. It took a couple reminders, but they eventually nailed it.
	•	We ordered Negronis on two different days, one day it was outstanding, the other day… it was subpar. Slight inconsistency.

Final Thoughts:
If you want true boutique luxury, privacy, insane views, and zero cruise-ship energy this is your place. It feels personal, peaceful, and genuinely high-end without being stuffy which is so hard to come by!! Perfect for couples and honeymooners who want Santorini without the chaos.",11,1764869323.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

It can be hard making friends when you're swamped with student life, and I totally get how easy it is to feel stuck in the ""campus bubble."" It and also be nice to meet people who aren't in your major or living in the dorms and just want to chill around the city.

Here’s exactly how he’d use these six core objects (and how hundreds of family-owned businesses across the country are doing the exact same thing right now):  
  
Leads → That random text from Woody Harrelson: “Wanna do another movie?” Instantly becomes a Lead titled “Multi-Billion Dollar Blockbuster Idea.”  
Contacts → Woody, Reese, his agent, the brand manager at Lincoln — now with birthdays, kids’ names, favorite bourbon, all in one place.  
Accounts → Production companies, Pantalones Tequila, j.k. livin foundation, the university he’s keynoting.  
Opportunities → The actual movie deal — dollar amount, close probability, next steps, projected date.  
Cases → “Warner Bros just dropped out — we need a new studio yesterday!” → Open a Case, assign it, track it, solve it.  
Activity → Every email, call, text, and voice note automatically logged next to the right person (Gmail or Outlook integration does the heavy lifting).  
One click turns a Lead into a Contact + Account + Opportunity. One problem pops up → open a Case → keep the deal alive. Zero chaos. Total control.  
   
And it’s not just for celebrities.  
  
The second-generation plumbing company, the boutique fitness chain, the specialty coffee roaster, the landscaping empire — every family business that outgrew spreadsheets faces the exact same mess.  
We’ve been cleaning up that mess for family-owned companies for over 30 years.  
We’ll set up Salesforce the way it should be, then connect it to QuickBooks, NetSuite, Xero, Sage — whatever you already use — so nothing ever falls through the cracks again.

1pe5zjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1pe5zjq/lets_talk_about_cooking/,Let's talk about cooking,"# Lots of pros

Generally speaking: cooking feels like a well-developed sub-game that is extremely detailed and pretty fun (IMO). There are a huge number of recipes, and a wild amount of things you can cook, with several fun or gross outcomes. It gives off great ""Delicious in Dungeon"" vibes.

# Soups are too good

Where it feels lackluster IMO is that there just isn't enough practical reason to pursue it - mostly because of soup! Soups were clearly the ""first draft"" and they cover everything you'd want: they give special buffs, plenty of output for the input required, they don't spoil, and they can be carried around easily. They also give an escalating and reasonable amount of ""hunger"" and ""thirst"" per use. There are later recipes like pies and sushi but they have fewer servings and all spoil! There are a few single-meal recipes that give more hunger/thirst than soup, but again: they spoil and they're not nearly as resource-efficient. Most do not give buffs.

Soups also get their own special recipe page, which - while still unsearchable, unfilterable, and untagable - helps you discover recipes and somewhat keep track of them.

The other problem is that you don't get access to all these baking recipes until cooking level 10! That's a HUGE ways away. In a solo game with the double cooking XP perk, I didn't reach level 10 until the reactors. By that point: there is no point.

So how do we improve this system?

# What are the parts

First, let's examine sub-parts of this system:

* For those who hate cooking, vending machines are plentiful early-game and effectively infinite. They require money, which is also technically infinite (and once you get to Str level 5, you don't even need that). Ice cream and canned peas are also infinite after >!Farhill!<.
* Fridges store food but only slightly slow the decay process on normal settings. This makes finding new food a continual need until >!freezers !<can be made after a portal world in the hydroplant area.
* Soups require cooking level 3, which is fairly quick to reach by frying things.
   * They require a large amount of water, which is tedious to make in the very early game, and then quickly becomes simple to acquire and then a non-concern mid-game after a portal world in the hydroplant area.
   * Soups are placeable and they never spoil. They give 8 servings, and are used with ""soup bowls"" that give 2 servings per inventory slot and also never spoil. (Notably, the soup bowls continue to use an inventory slot even when used up.) They require pots which are abundant and quickly become infinite.
   * ALL soups give special buffs. Most reduce hunger/thirst drain, while some give buffs that help in certain areas or with gaining XP.
* Baking requires cooking level 10, which takes a very long time to reach for anyone who isn't a dedicated chef for a group.
   * Creating an oven requires finding >!carbon!<, which is found relatively early on in the labs, and >!carapace!<, which isn't found until a portal world near the end of the lab area.
   * Most baked goods do not give buffs.
* You can trade for the >!Carson Family Cookbook!< which gives +50% cooking XP, but not until after the Security Sector. There is also a trait that gives +100% cooking XP for 2 points.
* A warming drawer can be created, but it requires >!magnetic alloy!<, which isn't available until the beginning of the security sector. It also currently serves zero purpose. (It literally has no function; it doesn't spoil food faster and the only thing it can keep warm is coffee, which you never actually need to keep.)
* Fishing is tied in to cooking, with each new area giving access to new fish, which unlock new recipes. Nearly all of these recipes are tied to baking, though. Frying fish on its own is only useful for cooking XP, as no fried fish are used in other recipes.
* Alien meat is used extensively from the beginning of the game, and when fried it contains unsafe levels of radiation. Alien meat that is used in soup or cooking recipes are safe. Later you acquire seeds, and continue to get new food items until late game.
* Baking relies a lot on >!wheat!<, which you get as early as the manufacturing sector. Later >!seaweed !<is added during the hydroplant area which opens up many new recipes.
* The Core Keeper collab added >!larvae meat and tulips!< which can be used to make a fried dish that gives a lot of hunger; these are accessible at the end of the manufacturing sector.

# What can be improved

Soups are well-designed and continue to improve for the first 2/3rds of the game. The main issue is that baking needs to be improved to match soups, and soups may need to be nerfed slightly.

* Baked foods need their own buffs
   * If all soups get one buff, give other items something else! Maybe all fried foods don't give a buff, but anything baked should give a buff that is at least as good as Souper Satisfied, but it should probably be better. Maybe ""well fed"" and it does the same thing but it lasts 1.5x as long?
   * Additionally, we can add more specific buffs for food in certain areas. For example: >!apple-based!< recipes could give the ability to see enemy outlines for a short while. Maybe >!shadowberry!< recipes increase stealth, etc.
* Baked goods give more ""hunger"" and ""thirst""
   * One of the biggest problems is that a cake/sushi/pie gives 6 servings instead of 8 for soup, and those servings are individually worse than a serving of soup. Baking involves more steps, more ingredients, and is more difficult; it should give better results.
* Soups give 3 servings by default
   * The max players is normally 6, so 4 servings of soup is just weird anyway. Make it be 3, so you need 2 soups to serve everyone. This also makes soups a little less resource-efficient and indirectly buffs baked goods. I'd still suggest buffing baked goods even after lowering soup portions - that's how good soups are.
* Change learning the Oven and Dough recipes to be part of the level 5 cooking perk
   * This gives access way earlier and makes the level 5 perk not worthless. Nothing else needs to change on the cooking perk tree.
* Change the recipe for the Oven to replace 2 >!carbon plating!< with 2 metal scrap
   * This puts baking at the beginning of the labs (you still need >!carbon!<), which is sooner than it is now.
* Change the warming drawer recipe to use 4 metal scrap instead of 4 >!magnetic alloy!<
   * This puts it around the same time as the oven.
* Soups can spoil - unless in a warming drawer!
   * This is a huge change, but I think it's needed. Soups need to spoil, or they will always outshine the later recipes. It also gives the warming drawer an actual purpose, and only ends up restricting soups for the first two areas.
* Baked goods also don't lose durability in a warming drawer
   * Instead of keeping them in a fridge, put them in the warmer. That thing is huge and has limited space, so it will either require more crafting or hard choices - which is good! Same thing with backpack spaces that give warming slots.
* *Alternate*: warming drawers slow decay, not stop it
   * This seems more fair since fridges only slow decay, but then you'd need a 2nd ""warming"" item that permanently stops warm items from decaying, like a >!freezer!<. Maybe some kind of special oven?
   * However, this means soups will always decay until the 2nd tier warming item is found, which definitely makes things a little harder. I'm not sold on this one.
* Dr. Carson shows up earlier
   * I think she could start appearing as early as Grayson (around the end of the manufacturing sector). This gives access to a cooking XP boost more quickly, and prepares folks for baking by the time they hit the labs.
   * Ideally: change the recipe for the ""Cheffigy"" (require >!solder!< instead of >!white paint!<) and make it a default option on the Chef's Counter, and building that starts to summon her - as opposed to having to meet her first and then build it. This makes her work more like >!Marion !<and seems like the original intent of this upgrade.
* Recipes need their own page, or ideally: **soups can be prepared at a cooking station**
   * The ""menu"" system of this game is just plain awful, but having two methods to make food is especially bad. I propose either the soup page gets a second page that also lists recipes (which doubles up what is at the crafting station but shows more ""theoretical"" options), or a better idea is that soups are craftable items just like everything else, and they show up in the crafting list just like everything else - unlocking as you discover them. We could use the chef table to make a bowl of uncooked soup, and then place it on a stove, rather than the current system of placing each item into a pot on its own.
      * The current system makes sense when ""soup"" was something you needed to experiment to figure out, but the change to give a full list of soup recipes killed that. So go ahead and remove the whole system; this will standardize soups to the rest of food and probably make it easier to allow them to spoil.
      * This change allows for the removal of the soup recipe page, which makes the menu slightly less bad. It also means you could tag soup recipes!
* Placed food needs to be able to be picked up, or at least moved
   * How is that not a thing.

I would go further and reorganize the hunger/thirst and buffs around **three basic food categories**:

* **Pan-fried foods**: low-to-high hunger, zero-to-low thirst, single serving, very few buffs (some are radioactive), inventory hogs (stack sizes of 2 instead of 4), most are very easy to make and the more complex ones give high hunger and buffs, can slow/stop decay in fridge/tier2 fridge (or warmer if that makes more sense) - very close to the current situation
* **Soups**: low-to-medium hunger, low-to-medium thirst, multiple servings, all have buffs, require warming drawers to slow/stop decay, inventory hogs (2 servings per slot) - very close to the current situation
* **Baked goods**: high hunger, low-to-medium thirst, multiple servings, all have buffs, require fridge to slow decay or tier 2 to stop decay, better stacking (currently 6 which is good)

Each of these could then be separated into their own sections, and **the entire food section could be removed from the crafting bench** and put entirely into the chef station. Then the chef counter would have 3 crafting menus and the crafting bench would have one less. That would help de-clutter the crafting bench slightly, and make more sense all around.

PC

**Genre:**

Strategy.   
AFAICR, focusing on relatively contemporary (later than WWII, but not very futuristic) military combat with rescuing hostages being a thing. It pains me to say that I'm not super sure about this. :(  
I remember nothing about who the ""bad guys"" were :/

**Estimated year of release:**

Around 2000s (meaning before 2010)  
Probably before 2006 (Nothing interesting to note, it's just a year I moved and I think it was before then)  
Could be 90s, but less likely, as I feel like it may have been 3D

**Graphics/art style:**

Don't remember a particular art style. IIRC, it was mostly top-down, but I can't say whether isometric or perspective, but it does feel like it was 3D based.  
Due to the low fidelity, I don't think there was much of an art style beyond a simplified, easy to read visual language.

**Notable characters:**

I don't remember any (beyond: see 'other'). It feels like it didn't focus much on individual characters

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**

I seem to remember that rescuing hostages was a thing.

Yellow as a color for highlighted units seems to be in my mind

**Other details:**

Okay, so here's what I really remember and what I ultimately want to find again:  
There were funny cutscenes, 90% sure it was pre-rendered 3D.

One in particular was **a man relaxing in a deck chair** (I think in the arctic of all places?) **with a coffee mug large in the foreground. He reaches for the mug and drinks from it, only to reveal that it didn't seem large because it was in the extreme foreground, but that it was actually huge.**

I think I remember finding a folder with all the cutscenes, and at least some of them were funny, and I can't remember which of them appeared in regular gameplay, and which may have been Easter eggs or bonus material.",1,1764869122.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

The difference? I started journaling every single day for 60 days and it completely changed how my brain works.

-----

## Where I was

24 years old. My life was just a blur. Days melted into each other. Weeks disappeared without me noticing.

Scrolling my phone 8+ hours daily. TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, endless consumption. At the end of each day I’d feel like I did nothing because I literally did nothing.

My memory was destroyed. Couldn’t remember conversations from two days ago. Forgot plans constantly. My brain just wasn’t recording anything anymore.

The breaking point: My mom asked if I remembered our conversation from three days ago about something important. I had zero memory of it. She looked hurt and said “you never listen.”

But I had been there. We talked. I just couldn’t remember any of it.

-----

## What I did

Decided to journal every single day for 60 days. Not feelings or deep thoughts. Just facts about what actually happened.

The rule: At the end of every day, spend 10 minutes writing down what I did, who I talked to, what I ate, what I learned. Everything.

Do this before touching my phone for evening scrolling.

-----

## Week by week

Week 1: Sat down to journal and realized I genuinely couldn’t remember most of my day. Managed three sentences about eating, scrolling, sleeping.

Week 2: Started paying more attention during the day because I knew I’d have to write about it later. Didn’t want to write “scrolled TikTok for 6 hours” every night.

Week 3: Entries getting longer. Could actually remember conversations and details. Brain starting to record things again.

Week 5: Could remember what I did last Tuesday. Specifically. What I ate for lunch, who I talked to, what I worked on. Memory was sharp again.

Week 8: Completely stopped evening phone scrolling. Used to scroll 3 hours before bed. Now I journal for 10 minutes and sleep. Replaced waste with something useful.

-----

## Why this works

Journaling forces your brain to process and encode the day into long term memory. Scrolling does the opposite, floods your brain so nothing gets stored.

Also makes you conscious of how you spend time. Seeing “scrolled phone for 5 hours” written in your handwriting hits different than doing it mindlessly.

I used Reload to remind me to journal each night and block social media until I finished. If Instagram won’t open until you journal, you journal.

-----

## What changed after 60 days

Memory is sharp: Can remember details from weeks ago, conversations, plans, ideas.

Time feels real: Days don’t blur anymore. Can tell you what happened each day this week because I wrote it down.

Reclaimed time: Used to scroll 3+ hours before bed. Now journal for 10 minutes. Have those hours back for sleep or reading.

Relationships improved: People notice when you remember what they tell you. Mom said I’ve been more present.

More intentional: Knowing I’ll journal about today makes me think about how I want to spend today.

Phone use dropped: Went from 8 hours daily to under 2 hours. Not from willpower, just replaced scrolling with something better.

-----

## The entries aren’t fancy

Just facts. “Woke 8am. Worked out 45 minutes. Coffee with Dan, talked about his job. Worked 3 hours. Read 30 pages. Made pasta. Called mom.”

But reading back through 60 days makes me realize how much has happened. Before journaling all those moments would have disappeared.

Now I have proof I actually lived those days instead of letting them evaporate.

-----

## If you want to try this

Journal facts about what happened today for 30 days minimum. Takes 10 minutes.

Not deep reflection. Just document: what you did, who you talked to, what you learned, what you ate.

Do it before evening phone time. Make it a replacement not an addition.

Use reminders or blockers to enforce it. I needed external structure or I’d forget.

Don’t aim for beautiful writing. “Went to gym. Talked to Sarah. Made tacos. Read chapter 5.” That’s enough.

After a week you’ll start noticing details during the day.

After a month your memory will be sharper.

After 60 days you’ll have reclaimed hours and have proof you lived those days.

-----

60 days ago my days blurred together and I couldn’t remember yesterday.

Today I can tell you what happened on any day in the past two months because I wrote it down.

Time feels real. Memory works. Life doesn’t disappear anymore.

All from 10 minutes of journaling per day.

I had two losses in total after enduring the whole IVF process this year. This last pregnancy took a toll on me as I was so happy about it I was eating a lot of food and snacks, both healthy and unhealthy, resulting in me gaining over 10 pounds. I was already not happy with my weight before the pregnancy, so there’s that. 

After the loss and the medical condition that came with it, I am not cleared to start working out. I started my calorie deficit on Monday. I don’t eat anything before 12 on most days, however I do have a coffee with a splash of milk and sugar. I will say I cannot drink coffee black. I just can’t. It’s the only happiness I look forward to every day after what I’ve been through, so please understand this. 

I did start my first period since the loss, and noticed that my weight fluctuates higher in the morning than before by 1-2 pounds. It’s been disheartening, however I’m realistic when it comes to it all as I just had a loss and my hormones are all over the place.  I eat a lot more protein in my breakfast and lunch to the point where I am not even hungry for a full dinner, resulting in me being able to stay under and within my calorie deficit. I have also started yoga Pilates and walking on my treadmill. I’ve been very stressed because my dog suddenly got extremely sick as well and has been emotionally and financially draining me. 

All in all, I know the stress, anxiety and depression is contributing to my weight management, but are there any other tips for what I can do moving forward? anyone who just gave birth (normal or not) that can help me out with this?

Anyhow, this guy was adament on being called by his baptismal religious name rather than his legal name (I don't even know his real name because he was demanding we use his baptismal name in our men's group) and I had been distant from the parish itself for awhile due to the usage of the r-word by a leader in the church community. I have a pretty hard stance on people using that word due to the reality I myself have been called that word and I work with developmentally and intellectually disabled men and women every day for my job, and I find it extremely disgraceful and perjorative (akin to the n-word) when people use this word.

Anyhow in men's group the guy used this word and I had been looking for a reason to step away from the group, and this was it. SO I bluntly called him on it in the group and rather than take ownership he started reciting forgiveness prayers and begging for forgiveness and I said don't apologize to me. Apologize to a person or their family who are touched by the harm of that word. He offered to leave the Zoom and I said I would, he doesn't have to, and we had this huge debate in the Zoom about what the r-word is (yes I literally had to spell it out because the leader said ""what r-word? In my generatio,n it was OK"" Uh... No) and then we had to discuss this and I was like not up for discussion.

I then tried to bring it home by explaining a friend's brother has Down Syndrome and I said ""my friend is studying to be a goddamn priest..."" which made convert be like ""DO NOT TAKE THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN! HE'S THE REASON WE'RE HERE!"" and I didn't have time to argue back (I hold a master's degree in theology, but not much for church anymore, and I KNOW what the difference is between saying goddamn and the historic implications of Lord's name in vain. But it was a matter of it wasn't worth arguing because this guy seems so hard postured he wouldn't have listened. I stayed on the call until the end because someone was in a genuine crisis, and I made plans Saturday to get coffee with him to ensure he is OK. He said he was also really triggered by our yelling, and I feel like I need to make it right to the guy triggered not ""I got baptized recently"" guy. He's a good guy and I think he is being horribly mistreated by this group which is why I left, and while I am not going to outright say leave. I am going to check to see if he is seeing anyone.

I did write their pastor and said this group needs to maybe be reigned in a bit (there's never been a pastor or deacon attend) because they have proposed some dangerous ideas and I want to be sure it doesn't lead to parish schism, but I think the big thing too I told him is can you make sure this convert isn't going to go into a zealot extremist mentality because I don't know if he is posturing hard or if he is like this at work now, and I don't want him to harm himself or others with his actions.

But yeah this week has been weird for me and my healing from religious groups because of how I didn't leave this group cleanly. I also said this is my last meeting in the call, so let's see what happens.",1,1764868706.0,ReligiousTrauma,0,1.0,False

I've noticed that post menopause, I just move very slowly in the morning.  I used to be out of bed and into the car on my way to the gym in 15 minutes.  Now I wake up, drag out of bed, drink a cup of coffee like a stunned sloth on the couch, and slowly ease into very basic morning routines.  This is actually an improvement because before I was struggling to even get out of bed.

Morning is the only time I can really exercise due to work and family commitments, but I just can't move fast enough and wake up fast enough to actually work out.  I've really improved my sleep over the last few months and so I don't think that is the main issue anymore.  I just feel like I'm slogging through tar for the first two hours of the day.

Reminding everyone to follow the r/cocktails rules in your AoC posts, especially about writing instructions in your posts. With that said, I love the participation and discussions!

Today's cocktail is...

# Revolver

\_\_\_

**History**

The Revolver is a celebrated modern classic cocktail created by bartender Jon Santer in San Francisco in 2004. It was developed originally at Bruno’s as a way to showcase Bulleit Bourbon, and later gained wider attention when Santer moved to the influential Bourbon & Branch speakeasy ([whiskyadvocate.com](https://whiskyadvocate.com/revolver-cocktail/)). The cocktail is often described as a riff on the Manhattan or Old Fashioned—replacing sweet vermouth with coffee liqueur, balancing the bourbon with a dash of orange bitters, and finishing with a dramatic flamed orange twist ([homebarmenu.com](https://www.homebarmenu.com/recipe/revolver)). Its name, Revolver, is thought to evoke the bold, punchy nature of the drink and was reportedly inspired by debates Jon Santer had with jazz musicians, tying into a sense of theatricality and resistance to cocktail norms ([vinepair.com](https://vinepair.com/cocktail-college/the-revolver/)).

As cocktail culture expanded in the early 2000s, the Revolver gained traction for several reasons:

* Its approachability: familiar flavors presented in a sophisticated format
* Its minimalism: only three ingredients plus a garnish
* Its theatrical flamed peel, which helped it stand out
* Its adaptability to different bourbon profiles

By the 2010s, the Revolver had become a standard feature on many whiskey-focused menus and was adopted into modern cocktail literature.

The Revolver exemplifies a key movement in early craft-cocktail revival: reinventing classics with accessible ingredients while showcasing modern flavor sensibilities. Today, the Revolver is widely considered a modern classic, regularly appearing on cocktail bar menus and in discussions of influential 21st-century drinks.

\_\_\_

**Revolver**

* 2 oz (60 ml) bourbon (originally Bulleit)
* ½ oz (15 ml) coffee liqueur (e.g., Tia Maria or Mr. Black)
* 2 dashes orange bitters
* Garnish: flamed orange twist

1. *Combine bourbon, coffee liqueur, and orange bitters in a mixing glass filled with ice.*
2. *Stir for about 20–30 seconds until well chilled and lightly diluted.*
3. *Strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass (or serve over a large ice cube in a rocks glass).*
4. *Express the oils of an orange twist over a flame (e.g., holding peel over a lit match) and optionally rub it along the rim, then drop it into the drink as garnish.*

A note on the coffee liqueur choice, transcribed from an [Anders Erickson video about the titular cocktail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOZcQvZ6oY)

>*You can think a little bit longer and harder on the coffee liqueur. Usually my (Anders) go-to would be something like Mr. Black, it's a great coffee liqueur if you like big, strong, robust coffee flavour, it has a quite bit less sugar, so it does make for a drier cocktail. However, I do think that in this drink it needs that sugar, Tia Maria has a good amount of sugar, coffee is alomst on the back burner. You get a lot of vanilla and other flavours. In this context, I think it makes a rounder, enjoyable revolver. \[...\] If you do use a different coffee liqueuer, you might have to adjust with some sugar.*

\_\_\_

**Variations**

A few riffs and variations to explore:

* Use a high-proof rye whiskey instead of bourbon for a spicier edge ([tasteselectrepeat.com](https://www.tasteselectrepeat.com/blogs/cocktail-recipes/revolver)).
* Substitute orange bitters with mole or chocolate bitters to accentuate rich, dessert-style chocolate or earthy notes ([tasteselectrepeat.com](https://www.tasteselectrepeat.com/blogs/cocktail-recipes/revolver)).
* Use different coffee liqueurs (see note above about coffee liqueur choice above) —like Mr. Black for robust cold brew character or Kahlúa for sweeter profiles; these significantly influence the cocktail’s balance and flavor dynamics ([barfaith.com](https://barfaith.com/revolver/))
* For an extra aromatic twist, play with the ratio of bitters or consider a smoky bourbon to elevate complexity.

1pe5pvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/munichsocialclub/comments/1pe5pvz/movie_next_tuesday/,Movie next Tuesday? 🍿,"Hi everyone!

I’m a 24F, new to Munich, and I was encouraged to join Reddit by all the warm and welcoming posts here. I’m looking for someone to join me for a movie next Tuesday, and maybe make it a regular Tuesday thing if it clicks!

A bit about me: I use cinema as a medium to know the world, so I’m highly intrigued by international films. The lesser known, the better; the less conventional, the better. I’m not exactly a movie buff (yet :p), but I’m earnestly trying to become one. Some of my favorite directors are Wong Kar Wai, Abbas Kiarostami, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, Bong Joon Ho, Satoshi Kon, David Lynch, Mrinal Sen, and Shyam Benegal, Chris Maker.

I’m more of a listener than a talker, so I’d love to just enjoy a film together and listen to you talk about anything and everything over coffee afterward. I’m free after 5pm next Tuesday, and we can decide on a movie together.

Looking forward to meeting someone who’s up for sharing a good film and maybe some coffee afterward! 

Danke und LG! :)

1pe5lma,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1pe5lma/help_deciding_what_way_to_go/,Help deciding what way to go,"Hello everyone, I recently decided it's time to upgrade my movie experience. 

I currently have an LG 77"" OLED, and I love it but I have been getting the itch for a couple of years now to upgrade to the 83"" version, which costs 5k.

Recently, I have been seeing a lot of positive reviews around the Valerion VisionMaster PRO 2. I figured for $2,500 plus a screen, it is a better upgrade path and value.

  
Once I started researching the projector and screen, I was ready to pull the trigger, but here is the issue.

The way my living room is laid out was causing issues with where I could place the projector. I would have to get a tripod and place it behind the couch during movies and break it down when not in use. Right behind the couch, we have a small walking area and sliding glass doors to the lanai.

That was issue one. The second issue is that with having the TV on the wall and having an entertainment center, I can't buy a fixed wall screen, and the wife doesn't want a pull-down on the ceiling.

So I started looking at ultra-short-throw projectors and decided on the NexiGo Aurora Pro MKII, along with a motorized floor rising screen.

The issue with this is that I would need to place the 120"" screen on the entertainment center (wife won't love this) have it rise and block my center channel, and also possibly make the screen too high up. I would move it to the floor when not in use. The UST will fit in a pull-out drawer on the entertainment center.

Or I could place the screen on the floor (wife approved) and place the UST on the floor in front of it when using it. Obviously, this will be a pain with lining up the screen for each use.

The other option would be to place the screen on the floor with the Valerion on a coffee table while in use.

So what I am looking for here are any ideas on how people did this with similar setups.

Also, are USTs visually better than standard projectors? This seems to be a large consensus, I hear. Also, I looked at 2 types of floor rising screens, white or grey with ALR, and it just seems the ALR screens have better picture quality, but are best with a UST. But this may not be good for the Valerion even with it being place below the screen.

I currently have the Nexigo, and the screen will arrive soon. I will be testing this, then possibly get the Valerion to test too.

Summary: UST on the floor with screen on the floor or Valerion on the coffee table with floor rising ALR.

1pe5lg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1pe5lg4/my_colleague_told_people_my_personal_info_and_is/,My colleague told people my personal info and is flirting with my boss,"So my colleague, Shelly, transferred to our NYC office. We’re on different teams now but work in the same building and I thought it would be great!

Since she got here, she’s telling everyone I’m her great friend and everyone’s telling me how awesome she is. Something rubbed me the wrong way about how she went about it but I didn’t say anything. Well, now things are getting weird.

My biggest concern is that she’s now flirting with my manager. Last week, I saw them talking in the hall when I went to the bathroom. I ignored it but she texted me and told me about how much she flirted back. I’m surprised because previously she said she didn’t like all his tattoos. Yesterday, I had my 1:1 with him and it went well. I told Shelly we can get lunch before or after my 1:1 so she knew. Turns out my manager asked her to grab coffee before all his 1:1s and she told him he better give me a great review today.

She’s also a big gossip! One of my co-workers (Molly) told me, “she might mean well, but she gossips a lot.” We were all at an optional firm-wide training on AI. Molly told me about it and is very interested in learning more. So her and I went. She invited Shelly and a few others. The whole time, Shelly kept talking to the person next to her. When Molly and I would look at each other to acknowledge, “this is good info” or “ouu! That person asked a great question.” Shelly would look at us and tell us gossip! She got a text about someone in the Miami office quitting. We literally could not have cared and she kept trying to talk about it in the middle of the training. I didn’t utter a word back but I could tell Molly was annoyed. Molly said something to me after about how she’s seeing Shelly going around to people in the office and gossiping. Molly is one of my closest work friends and I respect her work ethic a lot. 

We went to lunch with a different colleague (Tony) and Tony was complaining about his wife’s relative at thanksgiving. In the last, I vented to Shelly about my BF’s mom. I told Shelly this in confidence when we went to lunch together one day on a Sunday. She says to Tony, “that’s like OP. She has issues with her in-laws too.” My jaw dropped!! What’s crazy is, Shelly told me she had issue’s with her ex’s mom too so why would Shelly talk about my personal situation instead of her own?? I felt so uncomfortable and said I had to go back to my desk and work. I don’t know Tony like that nor do I want people at work knowing my personal business. I hadn’t even told Molly or anyone else this.

Yesterday. She said She’s planning on leaving the office at 4:30 today and asked me to come. I said I’ll be staying till 5 to finish up my work. She said, “oh come on! I’ll make sure (manager’s name) won’t mind.” There is a complete lack of professional boundaries. Instead of working from home on Friday, I switched my schedule to WFH today so I don’t have her trying to pressure me into leaving work early. 

Shelly is either noticing and doesn’t care or is oblivious. Today, she’s texting me asking to get brunch on Sunday.",6,1764868292.0,coworkerstories,7,0.75,False
1pe5kcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetatrutideWomen/comments/1pe5kcm/taking_for_metabolic_and_neurometabolic_benefits/,Taking for metabolic and neurometabolic benefits but losing too much weight,"Hello. I have been taking retatrutide for several of its benefits for the last two months, just 1.2mg/week at this point (2mg was way too much), but my weight is creeping downwards. I don’t need to lose any more. 

I’d like to stay on this drug long term because I believe I have inherited metabolic and neurometabolic disorder, which has manifested, from puberty onwards as:

- afternoon energy crash regardless of diet.  
- trouble waking up in the morning, any time of year.  
- needing 1-2 hrs to feel awake in the morning, with or without coffee.  
- very severe and debilitating seasonal affect  
- constant suicidal ideation in the winters (I live very far North and don’t plan to move).   
- bipolar II disorder (research strongly supports the correlation of metabolic dysfunction with bipolar and schizophrenia, the most biologically-rooted of severe mental health disorders)
- attentional issues and brain fog  
- abrupt sleepiness and tiredness after eating carbohydrates.  


Every single one of these issues is either completely gone or no longer interfering with my life since adding retatrutide to Auvelity, an antidepressant I’ve been on for a year now. Auvelity didn’t help with morning wakefulness or energy crash, carb coma, etc. I found that retatrutide has allowed me to feel energized by food instead of exhausted by it, and to feel more energized and focused in general. 

In Bipolar disorder, numerous cellular energy cascades and mitochondrial morphology and function are notably damaged or dysfunctional. 

GLP-1s have been found to sweep beta-amyloid plaques out of the brain as well—the ones associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s. In fact, Alzheimer’s Disease has been called “Type 3 Diabetes” as it involves poor energy regulation in the brain. 

So it’s unsurprising that a drug that sensitizes the entire body to glucose, regulates insulin, and  improves different ATP pathways would improve neurometabolic regulation, as pretty much every cell in the human body contains GLP-1 receptors. 

However, my weight is creeping downwards and I’m unsure of how to ramp down without experiencing horrible hunger all the time. I tried going to .5mg (an entire day and a half late) and experienced a lot of hunger pain and distraction, though the late dosing may have been more relevant than the amount. 

Is anyone here taking this drug for non-weight loss reasons (diabetes, longevity) and maintaining their weight? Do you have any insight or tips? 

Thank you!

I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

I am visiting NYC from 1/16-1/19 to see friends, but would love to have someone to hang out with consistently through the weekend, go on adventures, and to enjoy fun dates with. I'll be staying near Koreatown.

Id like to go ahead and start chatting so we can spend some time getting to know each other and get comfortable (and to make sure vibes are good)!

Maybe we show each other out favorite local food spots, or try new ones in the city. Maybe we get coffee and drink explore a museum, or grab Korean and dance the night away? I'm always open to tying new places!

If we have fun, I'm very much love to keeping the connection open. Hope to hear from you soon! ",2,1764868157.0,amwfdating,0,1.0,False
1pe5ix3,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1pe5ix3/roommate_saying_conversation_is_out_of_touch_with/,Roommate saying conversation is “out of touch with reality”,"I think I need to leave this roommate situation, and I literally HAVE to vent about what’s been going on somewhere, so here it goes. This is what I’ve been putting up with for the past 6 months. This will be long, I have a lot of pent up rage, no obligation to read it all.


- Roommate started communicating only via text and sticky note and putting up signs in the bathroom. The compost was never getting taken out and I kept having to pick maggots off of the bin with my fingers/the kitchen was full of flies, so I made a sign to remind us to take the compost out daily. They said me putting up the sign ""doesn't work for them"" and that I couldn't make rules unilaterally, and that they couldn't take the compost out daily. I pointed out the bathroom signs and they said the compost was different. 

- Their cat attacked my cats in the beginning, and once knocked one down the basement stairs. I didn't feel comfortable letting my cats out unsupervised with their cat in the house as well, so at night had to keep my cats in my room with a litterbox. One of my cats would meow all night to be let out, meaning I was averaging 1-4 hours of sleep a night. I asked if they could keep their cat in their room for part of the night so I could get some sleep. That ""didn't work for them"" because their cat needed to use the bathroom litterbox and was used to having the whole house. Note: I had, and still have, a litterbox in my room. 

- I was in the hospital for 2.5 weeks. They wouldn't let me hire a pet sitter for my cat when I was in the hospital because they weren't comfortable with someone coming into their space, so offered to take care of my cats. When I came back, they had been fed, but the litterbox hadn't been changed seemingly the entire time- none of the litter had been used and the litterbox was moldy and there were maggots/flies. There was pee dried on the floor. They said my cat was pooping outside the litterbox because she was mad I was gone, as if it wasn't because the litterbox was a biohazard. 

-They didn't let me have room for more than a few items in the fridge- had a few condiments, a few can of seltzer, and some cheese. There was our farm share that they suggested and I paid for shared for the household, and the rest was entirely their food. The freezer had room for one thin box and one pint of ice cream, and the rest was theirs. The entire pantry was theirs. I had room for pantry items in the basement, so mostly ordered takeout for the first several months. I brought it up- they said they'd organize the pantry when they were off work for a month in August. They did it around October, and gave me half a cupboard for pantry space- they still were using the entire two shelves and drawers they said were shared, so most of my stuff was still downstairs or in the basement. 

- They had someone come to reorganize the house, and suggested I take my sofa and put it on the porch. It was one of the only two items in the living room that were mine.

- If I left/leave anything on the counter, regardless of if it was a shared household item, something of mine, or something of theirs that they THOUGHT was mine, they put it in a cardboard box. This included the kitchen fly trap, potatoes I had left next to their other vegetables on the counter, kitchen utensils, or the grocery list notepad. They never asked me about them or mentioned it or asked me to stop leaving things on the counter, just put anything they decided was mine in the box. 


-When I came back from the hospital, they started being nice to me again and actually talking to me. They said I wasn't doing enough to help around the house, so I apologized and started trying to do as much as possible. They went to the property manager and asked if they'd be able to up their lease again the next year, and the manager asked about me- it wasn't until then that they asked me about renewing the lease with them. I really love this house, and don't want to leave, so agreed to do it. At that point, I had started wondering if it had all been in my head and I had imagined everything they did, and it had all been because I was bipolar and having an episode, so I apologized for being a shitty roommate and let them know that I thought I had been manic and taken my irritability out on them and my emotions had been distorted, and that I was working on finding the right medication to stop it from happening again. 

- As soon as I agreed to do it, they said they were glad, because if they had to move they'd lose their job from the stress of it and having to take time off. This effectively traps me in this lease- if I leave, no matter the reason, it's now my fault for making them lose their job. 

- I was leaving my coffee beans and coffee filters in the ""coffee corner"" under and on top of the espresso machine. They took them every day and moved them to my side of the cabinet. I eventually asked them not to do it and they said ""that doesn't work for me"". Apparently, the counter space is for working- but they were under the espresso machine, in the coffee corner. So then they said they looked messy and out of place. The whole thing blew up, and I ended up bringing up the cardboard box and how it felt like I couldn't have any of my stuff in common areas and the pantry issue and how sick I was of paying 2/3 rent and not having space for food. 

To the cardboard box thing, they said, ""sorry you feel that way, but that's not what's happening"". To the pantry thing, they said ""It's not true that you only have half a cupboard for food in the whole house"" which is true- I had room for 3 bags of chips upstairs and room in the basement. I was sick of having to go to the basement every time I wanted anything from the pantry, and was talking about room in the kitchen. 

I said I was reconsidering reupping the lease, because at this point I'm so sick of not having a say in anything in my own house, and was exhausted dealing with everything, and people have been telling me to get out of this situation since the first month. They said the conversation was “losing touch with reality”, that I should “read over it with someone else to understand the details of what they were saying”, and that they wouldn't talk anymore without a mediator present. 

A day later, they bought coffee beans, and left them on the counter for three days. At this point, I'm genuinely wondering if everything that's happened has just been a huge power play. 

I don't know what to believe. I did show the conversation to multiple people, and they've said I need to move out as soon as possible, and that the entire thing is manipulative and I don't need to feel crazy. But maybe I am losing touch with reality, and should be completely fine with all of this. In that case, I'm not stable, and should live alone. Either way at this point I give up and think I need to move out. ",4,1764868137.0,badroommates,5,1.0,False

Because it seems like once you've reached that peak, the pressure would outweigh the fun. Every game is just defending a legacy. Every loss is scrutinized. There's no ""winning"" anymore just not losing.

I work in a public school and the water is very hard. We needed an easy way to wash and sanitize cups and other dishes that students use. 

The dishwasher has a clear glass front window, and when it was new, I loved to watch the soapy water spraying all around. I was using Cascade gel or powder, and then Walmart brand gel or powder. 

At some point, I noticed the wash water was no longer soapy/sudsy. I tried adding citric acid to the wash, I did empty cycles with vinegar. These helped remove the spots and build up from the hard water. I cleaned the filter out regularly. I fill the machine with hot tap water (it doesn't get super hot, but it never did). I tried running the hottest cycle; the manual claims this is about 155 F for the first wash, and 167 for the final rinse. 
But I am still not seeing much sudsing action like it used to.

I called Nespresso today, and while they were very helpful and walked me through multiple cleanings and resets (which I had already done when I first started the machine), it still tasted like a mid-to-crappy cup of coffee, with slightly less bitter aftertaste. The espresso pods were okay, not wowing me. But I bought the vertuo line specifically because I thought the coffees would be as good as the espressos I had, and I’m more of a hot/iced coffee drinker.

This is my first real job after grad school, and my colleagues have formed a cohort over the last year. I was really good friends with one woman, let’s call Person A, because we started working here at the same time and didn’t know anyone, so naturally we spent more time together. We started opening up a lot about our personal lives. She later got involved in some pretty scandalous drama with someone else at work, but I never shared her secrets with anyone while giving her as much emotional support as I could. And on her birthday week I took her out to a very nice lunch offsite and got her a small gift, but she never remembered my birthday. I really didn’t mind at the time though. 

Persons B-D get hired in. We all get along well and start having lunch together, going on walks and coffee runs together whenever the nature of our work gives us some free time. The problem is that because I am in a long distance relationship with my husband, I drive over three hours at a time to spend the weekends with him, so I’m essentially not available on the weekends to spend time with work friends. But it’s the only chance for us to spend time together as a couple and we have a very happy, gratifying, and vibrant relationship. So it only makes sense that this cohort would spend more time as a group without me on the weekends. But I try to make up for that; I’ve tried to be as proactive a friend as my situation can accommodate; when Person B lost their beloved pet, I organized a group dinner to support them and reassure them they’re not alone and we are here for them. When Person C lost a family member, I baked them an entire box of fresh pastries—from scratch—after iteratively perfecting the recipe for them. When Person D was expressing how they were struggling with certain wedding plans, I sent helpful links of tutorials I researched online for them. I supported Person B in their job by giving them the opportunity to take on more responsibilities that will be noticed by leadership, a set of responsibilities they wanted in the first place, but also a set of responsibilities that are largely sought after. 

But I can’t help but feel excluded from them. Person D always starts any story or 1:1 conversation with “Person A, Person B, Person C and I” to me, which always made me feel like they were reminding me in some way I’ll never be as tight knit with them. They brag to me about knowing personal things about Person A that I wouldn’t know, even though I already knew those things since I knew her first, but I was keeping those secret to respect her privacy. They don’t invite me to lunch anymore unless it’s an afterthought; I often get really busy with work that I’m not always flexible at noon, so I can’t always make it, but whenever I am available, I always make it known I appreciate spending lunch with them. I feel like nonetheless, they can still at least ask me for the sake of making me feel included. They give each other small gifts and treats all the time but they never give any to me. I understand this too because they all are in much closer proximity to each other since their offices are closer, but I’m still only one floor below them. But whenever I bring treats to work for my team for very specific reasons, they’ll always swarm me to take some too. The last time I hung out with them as a group, Person C shared a large piece of news about their life to me based on our conversation, and persons A, B and D were so apparently offended that Person C didn’t share this news with them until now after I had asked. They’ve done countless things together outside of work that they never invite me to. 

I feel less and less confident about this, I feel less dignity around them, and it’s starting to affect how I view myself. I saw them at lunch again at a table, eating happily and laughing without me. Other big events have happened in their lives but they made it a point to tell me last. I’m not sure if it’s my personality or my sense of humor that they don’t like. I admit my jokes can be cynical sometimes, and so now I’m worried they think I’m some energy sink. Or if they just think I’m too busy—either from work or weekly traveling— to bother reaching out to. I do have to work a lot more than them I think; we all have our own projects, but mine is the farthest along and getting a lot of positive momentum, so I’m not able to be around at every lunch or every night to hang out. But whenever we are at work events together and my work receives praise from leadership, they’re right there beside me as my closest friends. I’ve even tried to support Person A by giving her opportunities to collaborate directly on my project with me, but her turnaround times for the job are so slow and undependable. 

It’s hard because I’m in a distance relationship, so without my partner, I don’t have a lot of support when I’m here, so things feel pretty lonely and isolating. I do have other work friends, and even though we don’t share nearly as much on a personal level, those people have still made time to hang out with me regardless of my schedule in our free time, so I’ll probably start to be more a more active friend towards them.
Is it presumptuous or narcissistic for me to think I put in effort and should expect more from this group of coworkers because of that? My love language is gifts and acts of service, but maybe that’s either not connecting or is being interpreted in some other way that’s incorrect? Am I just being over sensitive, and is it simply that I just generally don’t seem available that I don’t deserve to be as close with them? 

If I am overreacting, how can I check myself better to stop feeling so sensitive? If I’m not overreacting, how should I interact with them from now on? ",5,1764867187.0,AmIOverreacting,10,1.0,False

eventually i realized the problem wasn’t discipline. it was that my system required way too much effort just to start. once i fixed that, everything else got easier.

here’s what actually worked after 10+ years of screwing this up:

the 30-second rule  
if a habit takes less than 30 seconds to start, i do it immediately. not finish it, just start. starting is the actual hard part. making the start stupidly easy made the habit almost automatic.

shrink the habit until it’s laughably small  
i used to build habits like “read 20 pages” or “work out for an hour.” now it’s “read one paragraph” and “do one push-up.” tiny reps create momentum. momentum creates consistency. consistency creates progress.

design the environment so it’s harder to fail  
i stopped relying on willpower because i clearly don’t have much. instead, i made good habits convenient and bad habits annoying. water bottle on my desk, gym clothes out the night before, games unplugged. small friction changes make a huge difference.

habit chaining  
i attach new habits to stuff i already do. drink water right after brushing teeth. tidy something during coffee brew time. journal one line when i sit in bed. the trigger does half the work.

never restart, only adjust  
old me: “i fell off, time to rebuild the whole routine from scratch.”  
new me: “ok, what tiny tweak makes this easier?”  
tuning the habit beats resetting it. every time.

weekly reset  
every sunday i spend like 10 minutes cleaning up the mess from the week, fixing any friction, and deciding the one habit i care about most for the next week. it’s enough to keep the system alive without overwhelming myself.

none of this is aesthetic or inspirational. it’s not romantic. it’s simple and borderline boring, but it finally worked because it fits how my brain actually operates instead of how i wish it did.

and for tracking all this, i ended up using the hardcore habit tracker app. it’s minecraft-themed (my favorite game growing up) and turns habits into xp, levels, hearts, quests, all that fun stuff. it made the whole process feel like progression instead of chores. you can definitely do this with a notebook too, but hardcore made it way easier for me to stay consistent.

i kept trying to quit games and go cold turkey, but every time life got stressful or boring, i’d slide back into the same pattern. eventually i realized quitting doesn’t work if the thing you’re switching to feels like absolute zero stimulation. your brain is always gonna crawl back to the easier dopamine source.

so instead of just removing games, i tried replacing the part my brain actually liked: the progression loop.

it sounds dumb but the first thing i did was treat small tasks like mini dopamine hits. not fake hype, just giving myself a tiny sense of completion. doing one dish instead of the whole sink. writing one sentence instead of forcing an hour. once the bar moved even a little, my brain went oh cool we’re progressing and the rest got easier.

i also started stacking habits off each other. games do this all the time without you noticing. you finish one task, it immediately leads into the next. i copied that. make coffee = stretch for 20 seconds. finish stretching = drink water. drink water = open blinds. it becomes a little dopamine chain instead of trying to start from zero each time.

the biggest change was removing the dead time. whenever i had empty space, that’s when the gaming urge hit the hardest. so i filled gaps with low effort stuff that still gave me a micro dopamine lift. walking around the block, tidying one drawer, messaging someone back, journaling one line. didn’t matter what it was as long as it interrupted the autopilot.

and then i did something i didn’t expect to work but it actually did: i made my environment boring for the bad habits and fun for the good ones. games are great at reducing friction. real life isn’t. so i unplugged my console, moved controllers, put my phone across the room. and for the good habits i made everything stupidly easy to start. clothes ready, desk clean, water next to me. suddenly the dopamine cost was lower for real life than for gaming.

i track everything in the hardcore habit tracker app now because it scratches the same dopamine itch as minecraft (which i grew up on) but in a slow, steady, real life way. xp bars, hearts, streaks. not overwhelming, just enough feedback to keep me from drifting back to high-intensity dopamine sources. but you can do it with paper too if apps aren’t your thing.

**Brazil Steps Forward to Fill the Hemispheric Economic Vacuum, 1954**
&nbsp;
******


The economic disruptions shaking Latin America in 1954 have created a vacuum in hemispheric commerce. As multiple states face sanctions, credit freezes, investment withdrawals, and collapsing export sectors, the United States and Europe have begun redirecting procurement toward stable, dependable partners. Brazil, experiencing uninterrupted growth, industrial expansion, and renewed foreign confidence, now occupies a uniquely advantageous position. The redirection of import quotas, the contraction of competing exporters, and the reconfiguration of regional supply chains have opened a historic opportunity for Brazil to consolidate its industrial rise. To fully harness this shift, the Ministry of Finance, BNDE, and the Ministry of Industry, Labour & Commerce announce a new set of measures to further benefit from the external situation. This plan does not interfere in the internal affairs of any state. Instead, it ensures that Brazil becomes the primary beneficiary of the economic realignment underway in the Americas, expanding output where others cannot, stabilizing supply chains where others falter, and providing continuity in sectors now shaken by regional instability.


---
&nbsp;
## **I. Agro-Industrial Expansion to Absorb Vacated Export Markets**
&nbsp;
---
With several regional exporters suffering production collapses, inflationary spirals, or new tariff barriers, Brazil is moving decisively to occupy the commercial space left behind. BNDE credit lines will finance the rapid expansion of meat, grain, and poultry exports through the construction of modern slaughterhouses, cold-storage rail infrastructure, and a new fleet of refrigerated vessels, enabling Brazil to step into markets around the world previously supplied by crisis-affected nations. Frontier coffee and cacao cultivation will accelerate in the Amazon and Northeast as North Atlantic buyers reduce exposure to unstable producers, allowing Brazil to position itself as the most reliable supplier in an increasingly fragmented export environment. At the same time, a nationwide modernization of grain logistics, with new federal silo complexes, upgraded transport corridors, and improved bulk-handling capacity will ensure a steady and dependable flow of agricultural shipments. Through this combined expansion of production, logistics, and shipping capacity, Brazil aims to solidify its role as the continent’s primary agricultural anchor during a moment of widespread commercial disruption.

---
&nbsp;
## **II. Industrial Deepening**
&nbsp;
---
Instead of pursuing distressed foreign assets, Brazil is strengthening its own industrial base to meet hemispheric demand created by declining production elsewhere. BNDE financing will support the expansion of factories producing generators, trucks, tractors, electrical equipment, machine tools, and fertilizers, industrial goods once imported from now-unstable economies, but which Brazil will increasingly supply itself. Parallel investments in industrial research and development will deepen the technological foundations of growth: metallurgy laboratories, chemical engineering institutes, petrochemical pilot plants, and machine-tool design centers will grow in scale and ambition, ensuring that Brazil captures not only the markets vacated by struggling neighbors but also the technological initiative. A federal effort to attract waves of skilled migrants from crisis-hit states will further strengthen Brazil’s industrial workforce, with technical institutes absorbing and integrating these new workers into the national modernization effort. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of the Merchant Marine, through shipyard orders for refrigerated vessels, container-ready hulls, and bulk carriers, will consolidate Brazil’s control over regional trade lanes once dominated by exporters now in distress. While the region contracts externally, Brazil grows internally, stabilizing hemispheric supply and ensuring that lost market shares do not disperse but instead concentrate within the Brazilian industrial sphere.

---
&nbsp;
## **III. Export Expansion.**
&nbsp;
---
Brazil will seize this moment of continental supply fragmentation to secure long-term export dominance. A coordinated export offensive will promote Brazilian machinery, fertilizers, engines, processed foods, and electrical equipment in markets that have become undersupplied due to regional disruptions. As the United States reallocates import quotas away from unstable producers, Brazil will expand shipments of meat, coffee, cacao, grains, rubber goods, and industrial inputs—using the resulting foreign-exchange earnings to further diversify the economy and reduce external dependence and reliance on low-value commodity exports. BNDE-backed export-credit programs will further support this strategy by offering long-term financing to states seeking new suppliers for machinery and industrial goods, ensuring that Brazil becomes their primary and most dependable commercial partner. Through these measures, Brazil positions itself as the default supplier in a hemisphere undergoing forced economic reconfiguration.

---
&nbsp;
## **IV. Bilateral Clearing Agreements**
&nbsp;
---
To sustain commerce with nations facing currency shortages, Brazil will establish Bilateral Clearing Agreements designed both to stabilize regional partners and to secure strategic advantages for Brazilian industry. Industrial exports like machinery, tools, and equipment—will be delivered using idle or low-marginal-cost production capacity, keeping factories active without diverting high-value output from the domestic market. Partner states will pay exclusively in minerals critical to Brazil’s industrialization: tin, copper, bauxite, manganese, phosphates, rubber, and jute, ensuring a steady inflow of strategic materials. Agreements will fix exchange ratios at levels favorable to Brazil, guaranteeing higher mineral value per machine exported than the global market would otherwise offer. As partners adopt Brazilian equipment, long-term demand for spare parts, maintenance, training, and upgrades becomes locked in, entrenching Brazilian industrial presence across multiple economies and turning crisis into durable commercial opportunity.

---
&nbsp;
## **V. Infrastructure Modernization**
&nbsp;
---
To support the redirection of global trade flows toward its ports and industries, Brazil will embark on a new wave of infrastructure modernization. Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, and Belém will receive significant upgrades, including improved cargo-handling machinery, cold-storage terminals, petrochemical berths, and expanded dredging operations—preparing them to manage the increased export volumes displaced from destabilized regional exporters. At the same time, Brazil’s shipyards will double Merchant Marine capacity, constructing a new generation of vessels capable of carrying the country’s growing share of hemispheric commerce. These infrastructure investments will anchor Brazil’s expanded production capabilities, ensuring that the country not only captures new export markets but can reliably sustain them.

1pe4y0p,https://i.redd.it/r7xxglgav75g1.jpeg,The Roasting Plant; a London roastery to definitely visit.,"The longest time I’ve been a fan of Monmouth coffee by London Bridge. I’ve been aware of the roasting plant since it’s near where I work. I once tried their Ethiopian as a sample and was very impressed but at £60/Kg I was hesitant.

Today as usual I decided to take a quick step in see what they had. 

I noticed a Brazilian natural process reasonably priced £9.50/250g and decided to go for it. 

Honestly, so far I’m very pleased- The roasting plant triumphs in the following areas: 

The service was super friendly. 

You get a free prepared coffee every time you buy a bag (you don’t need to redeem it at the time of purchase (which is super neat!)). 

They are roasting regularly on site- as in- there are literal tubes adding fresh beans to the dispensers regularly throughout the day. Notwithstanding the novelty of it all, the freshness cannot be paralleled.

A natural process for under £40/kg is a good deal in my mind. I generally regard their pricing as no frills and fair.

Honestly I got so excited after buying I wanted to post without having tried it yet but suffice to say The Roasting Plant is driving a pretty hard bargain for specialty coffee here in central London. (Bonus it’s right next to the Royal Courts of Justice which are basically Hogwarts and worth a visit in their own right)

I will report back after trying!

1pe4xyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamification/comments/1pe4xyw/turns_out_i_didnt_need_more_discipline_i_just/,"turns out i didn’t need more discipline, i just needed game mechanics in my real life","i used to think people who talked about gamifying their life were kind of cringe, but honestly it’s the only thing that ever stuck for me. every normal habit system i tried felt like homework. i’d be consistent for a few days and then completely fall off because there was no feedback, no sense of progress, nothing fun about it.

games have this whole invisible system that keeps you going without thinking about it. levels, dopamine hits, quests popping up, new areas to unlock, the whole progression loop. real life is just like… do the dishes and hope you feel proud of yourself.

i realized i needed to steal the structure from games, not the motivation.

the first thing that helped was pretending my day had a main quest. just one thing that mattered. everything else was optional side content. it sounds silly but it stopped me from overwhelming myself with 20 different priorities and then doing none of them.

another thing was giving myself tiny rewards everywhere. not real rewards, just small moments of feeling like i gained something. vacuuming the floor became a little xp bump. sending emails became xp. talking to someone i’ve been avoiding became a crit hit on anxiety or whatever. it made boring stuff feel slightly less boring.

habits also got way easier when i tied them to triggers. like when a game loads a certain area and you know exactly what action to take. making coffee = stretch. brushing teeth = clean sink. sitting at my desk = write one sentence. once the chain reaction started, the habit didn’t need effort, it just needed the trigger.

i think the thing that really changed everything though was removing the stupid friction. i used to rely on willpower way too much. now i just set up the environment like a level designer. phone out of reach, water bottle filled, workspace cleaned the night before. suddenly it’s easier to take the action than avoid it.

and yeah, i track everything in the hardcore habit tracker app now because it scratches that minecraft-style progression itch i grew up with. xp bars, hearts, quests, all that. it’s basically the system my brain already understands but applied to reality instead of a screen. not saying you need an app, but it made sticking to this whole gamified setup way easier for me.

the cool part is once life feels like a game, you don’t need to force discipline. you just follow the mechanics and the progress happens on its own.

if your real life feels flat, add some game elements. it’s wild how much more playable everything gets.",2,1764866859.0,gamification,0,1.0,False
1pe4xjb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pe4xjb,Pantry remodel before/after,"So excited to finally post here, let’s hope you don’t roast me! We live in a 1k sq ft city condo that has a massive walk in pantry. What a gift in a big city. The before was fine - shelves and tons of storage. But I wanted it look nicer and give us more counter space in a condo kitchen.

First up - the door. The door never could open all the way, so part of the room was unusable. I looked into retrofitting pocket doors, but that wasn’t going to work with our pipes (and wow $$$$). We decided to just remove the door.

For design, we went through many ideas - Home Depot won’t do small projects like this and many tried to get us to use closet experts. We found a few designs we really loved, but the issue was nothing could really match our existing kitchen. Without a door, I wanted it to look as seamless as possible. It had to be custom because it couldn’t be normal counter depth given the space. 

I reached out to a local contractor and was quoted 12k. Too much! We ended up getting RTA custom cabinets that we designed. My dad is one of those that’s great at home projects - he built a tiny home himself. He came out and did the install with us - thank goodness, it was WAY harder than I anticipated.

We had the countertop installed with matching quartz and a plug put in to do a coffee bar. We orders open shelves in a color that matches our kitchen island - a dark maple. Installed those ourself. 

Total pricing:

$4800 for cabinets
$985 for countertop
$20 for handles 
$500 drywall repair and electric 
$732 shelves 
$70 paint and random stuff 
Plus food and drinks to thank my parents 

I’m so happy, and it makes our kitchen feel bigger! This was our first major renovation and 90 percent DIY.

Hit a few formatting issues because I went with OpenLiteSpeed instead of NGINX. Nothing major—just new territory. Part of building something is running into problems you haven’t seen before.

This week felt like real momentum. Pages done. Checkout working. Systems in place.

But I’ll be honest: there’s a weird tension when you’re building something and there’s no proof yet. No customers saying it works. No revenue screenshot to post. Just you, believing the thing you’re making matters.

Need neighborhood recs (I-40 east access, family + dog friendly, single-family rental)","Hey all! My wife and I (moving from Raleigh, NC) are relocating to the Nashville area at the end of Feb / early March 2026. For my job I’ll be in and out of Nashville proper (meetings at Vanderbilt and other Hospitals) and then heading east on I-40 pretty often. 

Our situation:

Newborn + a 5-year-old golden retriever (yard is a must)

Coming from a small downtown condo. We want to rent a single-family home for Year 1 before buying

Hoping for some walkability (shops/coffee/parks/restaurants) if possible

Wish list: 3–4 bed, 2+ baths, an office, 2-car garage, fenced yard, updated kitchen (nice-to-have)

Budget & timing:

-Target move window: late Feb / early Mar 2026

-Monthly rent budget: $3,000 max (open to advice on what’s realistic)

Commute priorities:

-Easy access to I-40 (eastbound) for territory travel and easy commute to airport

-Reasonable drive into Vanderbilt for meetings

-Family-friendly vibe and safe, quiet streets for stroller/dog walks

Areas we’re considering (tell me if we’re on/off base):

-Donelson / Two Rivers – close to I-40, seems central for airport/Vandy/eastbound trips. How’s noise/speeding/safety on specific streets?

-Hermitage – more space, parks, still I-40 convenient. Any pockets with better walkability?

-Mt. Juliet – feels like a sweet spot for schools/amenities. What’s traffic like getting into town during AM/PM?

-Lebanon – too far for frequent Nashville meetings or still doable if I’m mostly eastbound?

-Old Hickory / Lake area – pros/cons vs Donelson/Hermitage?

-Open to others near I-40 we are missing! 

What I’d love your take on:

-Best neighborhoods/streets for a single-family rental with a fenced yard + walkability.

-Realistic rent for a 3–4 BR house in these areas.

-Commute reality: I-40 rush hour patterns, any cut-through tips to Vanderbilt/Midtown.

-Dog/family perks: parks, greenways, dog parks, stroller-friendly paths.

-Blocks to avoid (safety/traffic/noise) within the above neighborhoods.

-Where to find rentals (property managers you trust, Facebook groups, local sites) and scam red flags common here.

-Any new builds or subdivisions that rent and fit the “quiet street + quick I-40” criteria.

Bonus context:

-We’re used to downtown living but want a yard and quieter street for the baby/dog.

-Open to trading some walkability for an easier I-40 shot and safer/roomier neighborhood.

Does anyone else feel like they’re “cosplaying“ being poor? They’ll post about not being able to afford groceries, but then will do give aways (ex: coffee money), post about how much they make per month and how they spend their money? I see creators say they spend their money on new clothes, take out food, etc. I’m not saying they are rich, but if you truly were poor and unable to even afford food, why are you posting about buying a dress for over $100? It just doesn’t make any sense to me. ",6,1764866225.0,Tradfemsnark,5,1.0,False

But as always I shall *try* to look at it again at least once every four weeks until the post is again automatically locked after six months, preventing further edits.

In order to request any of these items you must go to the appropriate link for the [Xbox Series X/S](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/1129/category/14/platform1/20/xboxapp/No/subcategory/954/question/yes/subcat3/904), [Windows](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/1129/category/14/platform1/3/subcategory/954/question/yes/subcat3/904), [PS5](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/1129/category/14/platform1/19/subcategory/954/question/yes/subcat3/904) or [Steam](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/1129/category/14/platform1/6/subcategory/954/question/yes/subcat3/904). If you are playing on an older system it is simple to reach its page from one of these direct links. I am sure it goes without saying your player account must have sufficient Atoms available to pay for the item/s you choose. As part of the process Bethesda Support will respond to your request by ticket and email with the total cost of whatever you order.

This [page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop/Bundles) from the Wikia entry for Fallout76 may help with working out some of the bundles' contents. I cannot swear for the accuracy of the data however as with all wikis it is community-created support material.

I have had quite a few comments asking how long you can expect to wait. The answer is that it varies. In my own experience I have had items redeemed for my character within two hours. I have also had to wait for more than a month. Much of the process seems to be automated now and I would say the average time these days seems between two to four days.

1pe4jqj,https://i.redd.it/wwq1ydpks75g1.jpeg,Any tips to get the best out of these beans?,"First time I brewed these beans I did the following recipe:
19 grams of coffee - ground with a Timemore S3 at 2 setting (not sure what the lingo is for this)
304 grams of water at 93C
Four even pours at 76 grams
V60 02 brewer
Total brew time was under 2:30 minutes. 

The coffee smelled great in the brewing process. I could smell notes of Pineapple. Didn’t really come through in taste. Taste overall was nothing to note. Just an average tasting cup of black pour over coffee. Any tips? Any details I’m missing, please let me know. First time asking for a recipe troubleshoot. 

Thanks!!

Never in my life have I approached someone IRL. I’ve been working on myself,my social anxiety, and my self image quite a lot in the past year. One of the challenges I’ve tried to set myself is to approach a girl for once when I see someone who peaks my attention and gives off a nice vibe.

My confidence is definitely not in a good place, and I’m afraid of rejection, but all those things have kind of improved recently. I dont think of myself as incredibly ugly anymore and feel like to some people I might look passable (a development which I’m happy about)

However, I can’t help but feel like if I approach someone in a coffee shop, on the street, or in a shop, etc. as if I’m inconveniencing them and be afraid that I’m creeping them out. I’m afraid of being another one of those annoying guys who won’t leave women alone (when I don’t feel like that’s me). Perhaps this is another irrational fear, but is this something I just need to face, or how do I get over this? It’s not that I just want to be able to approach multiple girls everyday. I just want to be able to say hi to girl in the rare instance when I really do get a really nice vibe from her.

1pe4i07,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1pe4i07/looking_for_advice_with_yunnan_sourcing_order/,Looking for Advice with Yunnan Sourcing Order - Updated,"I'm looking to place an order on Yunnan Sourcing for the first time, and this is what has caught my eye (I've added tasting notes gleaned from others' reviews for my reference and kept them in the list to give context on what specifically drew me to these teas). There's some info on what I like below, and I'm wondering if folks might be able to help me/give me guidance with the order:

* Dan Cong Oolong Tea Sampler - Selection of Very Interesting Florals
* Traditional Smoked Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong Lapsang Souchong Black Tea (50g)
* Moonlight White Tea and Snow Chrysanthemum Buds Dragon Ball (10 Balls)
* 2015 Guan Yang ""Wild White"" Gong Mei Tea Cake - Floral-Honey w/ Slight Herbs (50g Sample)
* 2021 Spring Menghai ""Lao Shu Bai Cha"" White Tea Cake - Raisin-Honey w/ Florals (25g Sample)
* 2022 Yunnan Sourcing ""Man Gang Tea Flowers"" White Tea Cake - Intriguing Inclusion of Tea Flowers, Forgot to Add to Image Below (25g Sample)
* White Tea from Da Qing Village Roasted in Bamboo (50g) - Warm and Cidery, Smoky
* Wild Tree Purple Moonlight White (50g) - Floral-Fruit
* **Wild Tree Purple ""Sweet Ya Bao"" White Tea (Add 50g To Cart and Then Enter Code FREESYB at Checkout To Get for Free Since Total will Probably be >$125)**
* 2020 Yunnan Sourcing ""Big Snow Mountain"" Ripe Pu-erh Tea Cake - Chocolate (25g Sample)
* 2021 Yunnan Sourcing ""Jingmai Mountain"" Ripe Pu-erh Tea Cake - Coffee (25g Sample)
* 2021 Yunnan Sourcing ""Sunrise"" Ripe Pu-erh Tea Cake - Honey-Fruit (25g Sample)
* 2024 Yunnan Sourcing ""Ku Zhu Shan"" Raw Pu-erh Tea Cake - Florals (25g Sample)
* Obscured Glass ""Tumbler"" Cha Hai for Gong Fu Tea Brewing

For Pu'erh, I really like chocolate and florals as well as some earthiness/fungus/woodiness and am quite eager to taste the spice that the Crimson Rooster is touting. So far, I've been really liking very chocolatey xinhui tea oranges, sticky rice essence mini tuos, and a more mushroomy small leaf pu'erh that I got from local places. I normally like a stronger Pu'erh

For Bai Cha, I wanted to get some more aged stuff and specifically like honey-floral notes, but am also interested in a bit of woodiness. I recently got some Osmanthus tea coins from a smaller seller locally and have really loved them, so I thought, why not try these Chrysanthemum Dragon Balls.

I used to drink a lot of Tie Guan Yin, but have recently turned away from the caramel/malty notes. I am quite interested in the Wuyi Rock and DanCong samplers. I'm hoping to get those nice florals, peach, and honey.

Finally, I normally steer away from Red Tea. I got one random Yunnan Black locally and wasn't too much of a fan of the maltiness, but I've really wanted to try Lapsang Souchong for its smokiness for ages now.

Also, thanks to everyone for their advice on the first post and esp re: getting samples of the lot rather than a couple of select cakes out of the larger list.

Do y'all think this would be a good selection for my tastes? Any recommendations instead? I kinda want to get a good chunk for the holidays (probably won't get everything tho) that will set me up for the year. Also, does anyone have any advice re: shipping to Canada?",1,1764865843.0,tea,2,1.0,False

my partner and I are planning a 14-day trip in June 2026.
We already booked our long-haul flights and will arrive in Panama City (PTY) and depart from Panama City as well.

We would love some feedback on whether our route is realistic, well-balanced and makes sense time-wise — and if there’s anything we should swap or replace.

Below is our full planned itinerary:

⸻

Our planned route

15–17 June — Panama City (2 nights)
Arrival, Casco Viejo, Panama Canal, relaxed start after the long flight.

17–21 June — Bocas del Toro (4 nights)
Zapatilla Islands, Dolphin Bay, Red Frog Beach, Starfish Beach, snorkeling, beaches.

21–23 June — Cartagena (2 nights)
Old Town, Getsemaní, city walls, rooftops.

23–25 June — Salento / Cocora Valley (2 nights)
Flight CTG → Pereira → Salento, Cocora Valley hike, coffee region, Andean scenery.

25–26 June — Cartagena (1 night)
Stopover night before island transfer.

26–28 June — Isla Barú / Rosario Islands (2 nights)
Beach, snorkeling, quiet island time.

28 June — Boat back to Cartagena → Flight CTG → PTY → evening long-haul return
We have a large safety buffer.

⸻

🔍 Our travel style / preferences
	•	Budget: mid-range
	•	Likes: beaches, nature, quiet islands, relaxed vibes, coffee culture, scenic viewpoints, insta spots 
	•	Dislikes: long overland travel, party-heavy areas, unsafe border crossings
	•	Past trips: Bali, Japan, USA — looking for a mix of culture + nature + beaches.

We are particularly interested in:
Cocora Valley and the Rosario/Barú area.
We were also thinking about San Bernardo Islands, but are unsure if it fits.

⸻

❓ Our questions
	1.	Does this route make sense for 14 days?
	2.	Are the number of nights at each place appropriate or should we adjust something?
	3.	Would you recommend Rosario → San Bernardo instead, or any other alternative island stay?
	4.	Is there anything you would remove, swap, or add based on your experience?
	5.	Is traveling CTG → PEI → Salento → back to Cartagena in this timeframe realistic?

We’d really appreciate any advice or personal experiences to help us fine-tune the route.
Thanks a lot! 🙏🌴✈️

1pe4fnr,https://i.redd.it/s6a0mlw7r75g1.jpeg,I bought the coffee lid for the product on the left. I own the product on the right. They're completely incompatible. Yeti wont exchange the lid because I opened it which I needed to do to find out it doesnt fit.,"Both of these are ""Yeti Rambler"" products. The one on the left is ""Yeti Rambler Mug"", the one on the right is a ""Yeti Rambler Travel Mug"". How could anyone screw that up? Customer service said they could exchange it if it was unused and unopened. Well how on Earth am I supposed to figure out these near identical lids dont fit. They told me just to order a new one then. Get stuffed Yeti.

edit: here's some added confusion. The product I own is the 591ml travel mug. The viral ""Stanley Cup"" of yesteryear is called the Stanley Tumbler in Canada because if you say Stanley Cup in Canada everyone thinks you're talking about the top trophy in hockey. The lid I bought said on the package that its the coffee lid for the 591 ml Rambler Tumbler. All of these things have the exact same form factor.

I bought windshield wipers yesterday and it was way more straightforward than buying a lid for a damned travel mug.

edit 2: here some added context. This is the packaging for both of these products (i grabbed them from GIS so these two things might not be equivalent sizes)

Setting: Pre-dawn. It’s the day of The Surgery. The house is still, the world quiet like it’s holding its breath.

 

Desdemona stands in the hallway staring at Jeffy’s bedroom door. Her parents are in the living room whispering too brightly, too gently, trying too hard to sound calm. Coffee sits untouched on the counter. Toaster hums quietly, trying not to spark from nerves.



But none of that exists for Dez. Not right now. Right now her whole universe is behind the door in front of her. It’s plastered with drawings and sticker of dragons. And beyond it?

 

Her nine-year-old. Her heart with wings.

 

She pushes the door open. Jeffy the Dragonboy is sitting cross-legged on his bed, already awake. He’s holding something in his hands, cupping it carefully.

 

When he looks up at her, he smiles that big, loose-toothed smile kids have, all sunlight and sincerity.

 

Jeffy: “Hi, Mama.”

 

Dez’s throat closes. She steps into the room and sits beside him, pulling him into her arms. He smells like warm blankets and kid shampoo and safety.

 

She breathes in deep, afraid to let go. He hugs her back with his whole body, tight, fierce, and certain.

 

Desdemona’s voice cracks a little: “Hey, Dragonboy.”

 

Jeffy: “You okay?”

 

Of course he asks. Of course he sees through every layer of cheer people tried to plaster over the morning. Dez kisses the top of his head, eyes stinging.

 

Desdemona: “I’m okay. Just… a big day.”

 

Jeffy nods very seriously. Like he’s nine going on ninety.

 

Jeffy: “That’s why I got this for you.”

 

He opens his hands.

 

Inside rests his Guardian Dragon. Blue and silver plastic, tiny wings, glitter rubbed off in places. It’s the one he keeps on his nightstand to chase away nightmares.

 

The most important toy in his room. He holds it out.

 

Jeffy: “He protects me. So he’ll protect you too.”

 

Desdemona’s heart splits open in her chest.

 

Desdemona: “Sweetie… this is your special one.”

 

Jeffy shrugs, utterly certain: “I got lots of dreams. You only got one brain.”

 

It hits her like a punch. The innocence of it, the bravery of it. He presses the Guardian Dragon into her palm and curls her fingers around it.

 

Jeffy: “Don’t be scared, Mom. You’re coming back.”

 

She nods because she can’t speak. Her voice is gone, overwhelmed, drowned in love and terror and pride.

 

Jeff throws his arms around her, little wings fluttering.

 

Jeffy: “I’ll be here, Mama. When you wake up.”

 

Dez clutches him again, desperately memorizing him. The small weight of him, the shape of his laugh, the warmth of his arms, like she’s terrified the surgery might take any part of her that knows how to love him.

 

Her parents appear at the doorway, quiet, giving them space. Liz wipes her eyes behind them. Jeff looks like he wants a hug too. Toaster hums anxiously in the hall.

 

Desdemona stands, still holding her son’s dragon.

 

Desdemona: “Thank you, baby.”

 

Jeffy beams.

 

Jeffy: “Go be brave, Mama.”

 

She nods. She tries.

 

But when she finally steps out of his room, clutching the little blue and silver dragon against her chest, tears steam unchecked down her face.

 

Desdemona: “For him… I will.”

 

And the door closes softly behind her.

 

 

The Drive there…

 

Liz’s car. Sunrise bleeding orange over the horizon, too beautiful for the day ahead. The heater hums softly. The radio plays some forgettable early-morning DJ chatter. Her Dad is at home with her son.

 

Desdemona sits in the back seat, hands twisted in her lap around Jeffy’s Guardian Dragon. Toaster is in the back seat with her, seatbelt on, her vent emitting nervous puffs of cinnamon steam.

 

Mom drives on. Focused, calm, overly normal. The way people get when they’re trying not to fall apart.

 

Toaster bounces in her seat: “Today is the day! They’re gonna take the bad wires out of your brain and you’re gonna be ALL BETTER. No more seizures! No more meds! No more Keppra mood swings! We can celebrate with waffles! Or confetti!! Or waffle-confetti!!!”

 

Des flinches, not visibly, but internally. Every word is a tiny pressure point. Liz glances at her though the rearview mirror, concerned. Des forces a smile.

 

Desdemona: “Thanks, Toasty.”

 

Toaster leans forward, gripping the back of Dez’s seat with metal fingers.

 

Toaster: “It’s gonna FIX EVERYTHING.”

 

Her voice cracks with genuine joy, fear, and desperation.

 

Toaster: “You’ll be healed. Like completely. Right?”

 

That hangs in the air like a weight. Des swallows hard. Her throat is tight.

 

Desdemona: “Toaster… sweetie…”

 

She turns in her seat, meeting Toaster’s glowing LED “eyes.”

 

Desdemona: “I love how hopeful you are. I really do. But it… hurts a little.”

 

Toaster freezes: “Hurts?”

 

Desdemona: “Yeah.”

 

She exhales slowly: “Because what if I don’t get better?”

 

Toaster stiffens, blue lights flickering. Liz grips the steering wheel tighter. Not interrupting, but listening.

 

Des continues: “There’s a good chance. A great chance.”

 

She gestures vaguely at her head: “Sixty percent. Maybe more. Maybe less. But it’s not a guarantee.”

 

Her voice cracks: “I don’t want to disappoint anyone if the seizures don’t go away.”

 

Toaster sits back like she’s been unplugged.

 

Toaster: “Oh.”

 

The car gets quiet. Very quiet.

 

Toaster: “I wasn’t trying to make you feel bad.”

 

Her voice is tiny, mechanical but sincere: “I just… want you to be okay.”

 

Des smiles for real this time. Tired. Lopsided. Full of love. She twists in her seat to face Toaster completely.

 

Desdemona: “I know, Toasty. I know.”

 

She sighs: “You’re like my sister. Annoying sometimes–”

 

Toaster beeps: “Hey now–”

 

Desdemona: “–but full of love.”

 

Toaster’s lights warm again.

 

Toaster: “So… even if you still have seizures… you won’t be mad at me for hoping?”

 

Des lets out a breath that’s half sigh, half laugh.

 

Desdemona: “No. I’ll never be mad at you for hoping.”

 

She chuckles: “But maybe tone down the waffle-confetti talk for now, okay?”

 

Toaster nods vigorously.

 

Toaster: “Okay. I can be… cautiously hopeful.”

 

Liz finally speaks, her voice gentle.

 

Liz: “And we’ll love you no matter what the outcome is, Dez.”

 

Desdemona leans her head against the window, watching the sunrise blur.

 

Desdemona: “I know. I just had to say it out loud.”

 

Toaster reaches forward and squeezes Dez’s shoulder with a warm little metal hand.

 

Toaster: “We’ll face whatever happens together. Even if it’s scary.”

1pe4cos,https://i.redd.it/68pztvc9r75g1.jpeg,Inverted Method vs Flow Control Cap,"Every single day I had been using a recipe I had already tweaked and perfected using the flow control cap. I recently tried the “ultimate inverted recipe” I got from a YT video, tweaked some things (but not that many) and O M G the inverted recipe is FAR superior. Tastes like hot cocoa! Also, no mess so far lol I was actually scared to try any inverted recipes as I’ve heard it gets messy. In case you’re interested, here’s the recipe:

You’ll need
-15g coffee (I use a medium-fine grind), hot water, and room temp water (yes)

-add your ground coffee to the inverted AP
-Bloom for 30s using 50ml of water and stir
-add another 50ml of water and stir again
-put on the normal cap and filter
-leave for 2minutes total brew time
-while still inverted, push most of the air out
-turn right side up on your cup and press
-then add 100ml of your hot water to the cup
-add 30ml of room temp water 

I know it sounds weird.. it sounded weird to me as well in the beginning but TRUST ME it’s good. 🖤

I suspected the vape but never had issues with other ones before so shrugged it off. Got my old Geek Bar when in Florida, and today is 3 full days back on geek bar. My symptoms are literally almost gone. 

Just asked my dr if I could get nic patches sent to the pharmacy if possible. Either way, I’m done.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pe4927,https://v.redd.it/r8b1w4clq75g1,"54"" of pure cinnamon sugar","🌸 Hi, Reddit! I’m Isla!! 🌸

(21, nursing junior, full-time freckle collector, part-time chaos gremlin) 🥰✨

I finally made my own little corner here because so many of you have been so sweet in my comments and DMs asking for more of me, Foster, and our ridiculous life together. So… hi new friends!! 👋💕

Quick intro & backstory because I love telling this story:
I’m from a tiny coastal town in Northern California where everyone surfs, smells like salt water, and knows your business before you do 😂 I’ve been a redheaded, freckle-covered beanpole my whole life (think human cinnamon sugar). Foster and I met freshman year when I accidentally spilled an entire iced coffee on him in the campus coffee shop. Instead of being mad, he laughed, said “guess you owe me a date now,” and literally never left me alone after that. Two and a half years later and he’s still the human golden retriever to my overly-excited squirrel energy. We’re that disgustingly cute couple who finish each other’s sentences and have approximately 400 inside jokes.

I’m a nursing major (currently surviving med-surg clinicals and living off iced coffee and sheer spite). When I’m not studying or at the hospital, I’m usually dragging my friends (or letting Foster drag me) on the dumbest, most wholesome adventures: midnight beach bonfires, thrift store fashion shows, trying to surf at 6 a.m. (I’m still bad at it), making TikToks in grocery store aisles, or turning our apartment into a blanket fort for movie marathons.

You’ll probably see a lot of:
Me & Foster being grossly in love (he literally cannot keep his hands to himself, you’ll see the proof 🤭)
My friends and our unhinged group chats
Nursing school meltdowns & victories
Random aesthetic photo dumps because I’m obsessed with golden hour
Way too many pictures of sunsets, coffee, and Foster’s smile

So yeah… welcome to my chaos! Feel free to say hi, ask me anything (nursing school tips, relationship stuff, how to survive on 4 hours of sleep, whatever). I read every comment and I’m so excited to share our little world with you!!

Love you already,

Isla & Foster 🧡🌊
