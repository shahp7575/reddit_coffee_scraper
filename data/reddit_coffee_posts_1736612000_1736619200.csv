The thing is, I eat very little since I wanted to get thinner, and today my bf invited me to go hiking with his friends. I had my morning coffee and nothing else, yesterday I didn't have dinner because we went to the movies and I had popcorn.

So, the hike was fun. It wasn't an easy hike but we all are (or look) in shape. 3 hours in and I'm behind, my boyfriend is waiting for me all the time and the rest of the guys as super nice and checking on me. But all of a sudden, I start to fell really really unwell. I tell everyone to keep going but my bf stays behind with me and then... I throw up. I only throw up water and coffee but still. I throw up in front of 5 guys (my boyfriend of two months included). They brush it off and say it's fine and all, we keep going for another 3 hours and as soon as we reach civilization and I can leave I leave.

I want to hide behind a rock. I know it's nothing I have done on porpoise but God... I'm so fucking ashamed. And my boyfriend... who's a very fit guy... God... what's he gonna think knowing he's dating someone who can't do shit? ",2,1736618895.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hz1ufh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1hz1ufh/n2_medications_thoughts_no_sodium_oxybates/,N2 Medications Thoughts (No Sodium Oxybates),"
Hi! I’m 23 and was diagnosed with N2 a few months ago. I have severe EDS, wake up with headaches, struggle to fall asleep at night (of course), experience vivid dreams, and wake up groggy. I’ve been dealing with this for as long as I can remember. As a teenager, I took Adderall daily (for ADHD) reaching up to 50mg of a similar, longer-lasting medication (I can’t recall the name). Even then, I would still nap but it did help curb some EDS.

I stopped taking Adderall daily in college and just as needed because I was really underweight & the comedowns & irritability made me feel terrible. My fatigue was so bad that I started getting blood tests to figure it out, but over the last year or so, it’s become unbearable. I stopped working out, doing chores, and generally didn’t feel like myself. Without Adderall, I’d sleep all day, unable to keep my eyes open. Everyone around me seemed to be so frustrated with me, it sucked because I knew something was wrong. 

Now that I am diagnosed, my insurance refuses to cover any sodium oxybate medications. My doctor appealed twice and was denied both times. Lumryz is insanely expensive, and I don’t qualify for financial assistance. So, that option is out. I currently take the highest dose of Sunosi (which does nothing on its own) alongside Adzenys (25mg), similar to Adderall XR, M-F. Sometimes, I take an instant-release Adderall later in the day. I also drink coffee or an energy drink every morning. This combo helps a little with EDS, but it’s not enough. I’m still tired, don’t feel like myself, and deal with comedowns. I work in finance, where I have weekly sales goals, and it’s tough when I feel like a tired robot. And on weekends I only take Sunosi which doesn’t help. 

I’m desperate for something to improve my sleep so that maybe I won’t need all these stimulants and I can feel normal. I take Doxepin (prescribed by my psychiatrist before my N2 diagnosis) to help me sleep, but it doesn’t give me quality rest.

I feel defeated because it seems like the main options for managing N2 are stimulants (which I’ve used most of my life) or sodium oxybates like Lumryz or Xyrem (which I can’t access).

Can anyone share their experiences with other medications? I’m also open to general tips. I try to stick to a sleep schedule and was very fit and healthy until my fatigue worsened and completely derailed that. Unfortunately, naps don’t help either.",1,1736618876.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

1hz1tcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1hz1tcl/no_power_for_4_days_what_i_learned/,No power for 4 days.  What I learned.,"I just went almost 4 days without any power because of the high wind warnings in California.  Every six months I charge everything in my home and my go bags.  What I learned is that I had several lanterns (two solar charging that I really liked when I bought them) that will not hold a charge for very long at all.  For some reason they lost charge in-between charging periods.   I solar charged them, but again, they only lasted a few hours (possibly because of the dust/wind/cloudiness).

My favorite lights were battery operated candles.  These lights did not lose their charge for the entire 4 days and they ran on three AAA batteries.

Head lamps were my favorite things.  We'd actually tried a couple over the years until we found some that we liked.  My son gave some to our elderly neighbor.

My gas generator was run for the last two days and never once ran out of gas.  We turned it off at night.

My 4Patriot power cells kept our phones going.  We did have to recharge one in the sun, but it was cloudy from the wind.  It only got to one bar, but got my son's phone to 50%.  I gave these away for Christmas presents last year and I just ordered more.  I have a disabled son who often goes to the hospital and other chargers have failed me, but these seem to always get my phone charged for the longest periods of time.  Once in the hospital I set it in the window to recharge.  My son and I also charged our phones on one of these chargers the first day.  I think what I found most important is we could take our phones and this charger with us when we left the house if we needed too.  We couldn't take our generator with us.

I didn't turn our generator on until our refrigerator defrosted on the second day. There was water everywhere.  We put the freezer ice in one of the cold grocery bags and put things I couldn't put in my deep freeze in there on the first day and they stayed cold the entire four days.  (I have no idea where all that water came from.) I bought 6 small bags of ice for my chest freezer and put them on top.  Then I covered my chest freezer with blankets.  It stayed cold.  At the end of the second day, I hooked it up to my generator.  I checked and everything was still frozen on this day.

On day two, the stores within 30 minutes drive did not have any generators or electricity.  I'm glad I got the ice the first day.

Our large grocery store stayed open and took cash.  The internet was also down.  The gas stations closed.  The mini marts all closed.

People did not stop at street lights because they were not flashing.  They were completely out.  We had a couple of accidents in our town.

One night it got to 34 degrees outside.  We moved the generator so that it came through a window and taped over the open part of the window.  It was cold.  I'm thankful for lots of blankets.  

My propane water heater and stove top continued to work.  I lit the stove top with matches.

We originally had the generator under the patio.  But I started to smell fumes so we had to move it further away from the house.  My carbon monoxide detector did not go off.  I just felt like I could smell the fumes.    However, my son's smoke alarm in his room did continue to go off and I think it is because he likes his window open and too much dust came in.  We did end up disconnecting it because I found out that dust can damage them.  Again, we had many smoke detectors and one CO2 detector in our home and only his had the issue.  My oldest son is an electrician and we are going to replace all the smoke detectors with smoke/co2 detectors in all areas just to be on the safe side. 

Since I'm on propane, I am going to get a dual propane/gas generator (Gas stations closed).  I'm also going to get a pour over water filter and coffee pot.  I have a drip coffee pot, but the coffee just wasn't the same.

I also need a better quality thermos coffee cups.  It was cold and nothing stayed warm for any length of time.",3,1736618798.0,preppers,1,1.0,False
1hz1se6,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1hz1se6/31_m4f_usaonline_dance_dance_dance/,31 [M4F] USA/Online - Dance dance dance,"Let’s drink coffee together every morning and just talk about things. Don’t want to waste time without looking at you and spending time together ever again.

„I would not wish any companion in the world but you”

Dating me is like walking over the moon and reading Shakespeare.

I’m Jack, 31, i live on Midwest, but definitely want to move somewhere in the near future. Got Montana on my list, maybe Texas, somewhere west, but i’m open for suggestions. I love nature and quiet places. A big house, maybe a farm, or a ranch, big happy family and watching stars on the porch every night with my wife.
Even though reddit is definitely not the best place to find anyone mature and living close to you, i’m trying anyway cause you never know. Posting here from time to time and i hope that maybe my soulmate is gonna read it one day.

My grandparents met on a train. What if my grandfather missed a train that day or took a different one?
I don’t want to miss my train with You.


WHAT IS MY GOAL?

My goal is to find a fine woman, my soulmate to build a future with. I’m ready to settle down in the next few years, i want to have family and kids in the future and i know how to treat them well. I will kiss you good-morning and goodbye, open and hold the doors for you, listen to your needs and thoughts and be there for you whenever you need it. And what’s more important - i will always respect you and try to understand. I’m a gentleman and i was raised like that, i have a way with women and i can talk with anyone, just give me a chance. I can make you fall in love with me in 72 hours*

First of all i think three important factors you looking for are: 1. Mutual attraction 2. Similar goals/shared interests 3. He is not a complete dumbass

I will start with mutual attraction. I’m willing to exchange pics in private just so we know that this can work and you like my appearance. I don’t want to add my pic to this post cause i care about my privacy. I will be honest by saying it is an important objective, a physical attraction. We can share pics right away to not waste each other’s time.

To make things easier i can say a few things about my looks: 5”11 (180 cm), 165 lbs (75 kg), blue eyes, black hair, broad shoulders, deep voice, nice smile, good heart.

Second most important thing for you is who i am and what i like.

I’m a man of strong moral fiber. I value honesty, loyalty and kindness. I treat people right and i’m willing to help whenever i have a chance, i also care for my family which is super important to me. I see myself as a conservative person. I hold traditional values and i got much respect for religion and history. Individual freedom and free speech is all i’m about, also i’m a pacifist, i will defend my family and close ones with all i have, but at the same time i’m not looking for troubles and not getting into fights, that was never my thing, i like to resolve problems with words, not fists.

Shared interest paragraph is ready to go. I like to read a lot, i also write some stuff, im getting ready to publish my book one day (all i need is more inspiration from You, pleas be my Muse).

Music is my thing, i’m going to a lot of concerts and festivals, road trips, playing eight ball and soccer, watching youtube channels about history, science, cosmos and some other topics, i’m watching a lot of tv series and movies, like to spend time outside by walking or hiking, i like outdoors but i’m also a huge fan of spending time in bed and doing nothing.

Favorite music: too many to write them all down but grunge like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, some britpop or rock like Oasis and Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, Kings Of Leon, rap Drake, Kid Cudi, J Cole, some rnb like Majid Jordan, Jorja Smith, The Weeknd + dance or electro music like Tourist, Kaytranada and just much, much more :)

My favorite writers to name a few are Kerouac, Murakami, Vonnegut, Shakespeare, Bukowski, Fitzgerald, Sallinger.

Favorite director is definitely David Fincher, although i like Tarantino and Linklater and many more.

I love everything about 90s - music, movies, television, soccer, games, fashion, JUST VIBES in general. It was such a good time, good days. I like to rewatch movies from 90s from time to time, some funny comedies but also some romantic movies or both, recently i did it with Notting Hill, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, both are awesome! I can watch anything with Brad Pitt.

WHAT IS MY GOAL PART 2/WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR

As for the kids - i even have some names for kids that we can discuss it. I know how hard it is growing up without a father figure that’s why i always wanted to give that to my children, a big and happy home where dad and mom loves each other a lot and sending this vibe to their children. I also want to show to my kids all the books and music albums we love so much and i want to be for them always to raise them well! So if you are up for that - awesome!

I want a woman who is ambitious, i want her to support me cause i will do the very same thing. I want you to watch a soccer game with me willingly and i want you to invite me to your world, show me what you love and i want to be in it for you, even if it means watching a silly show in tv. Whatever makes you feel good, i want to be a part of it. Support, support, support and don’t kill the other person’s vibe, i’m up for it.

I want a woman that is willing to talk about our feelings and everything, cause a real talk is the most important thing to build a strong foundation. Let’s talk and don’t hide our feelings.

Life is worth living and it is way better to spend it all with the person you love, i want to find that person here. Maybe that is You? Let’s find out.

Also, the last thing - i’m not a complete dumbass, sometimes i’m just a silly boy!

FIND ME A GIRL AND I WILL MAKE HER HAPPY.

Also i want to include one of my fav quotes:

'Cause when you talk about these things, something ignites in you, and I can see it on your face.
And I don't see that on a lot of people. And, you know, whatever that feeling is, when you feel it, I feel that too.

And it's not just here. It's... It's afterwards. What I'm trying to say is i really like the way that I feel when I make you feel the way that you do.”

1hz1rrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/rhoslc/comments/1hz1rrz/i_am_triggered_by_britani_and_mormonism_rant/,I am triggered by Britani (and Mormonism rant),"We all assumed Britani was fucking Jared. She’s drinking alcohol on tv, shes drinking coffee on tv (just as bad for some reason), she’s not wearing garments, like yeah you aren’t following the rules of the church it’s obvious. I still haven’t gotten over her yelling at Angie for bringing the wine to her families house. Mormons can learn to deal with being in the same room as a bottle of wine. Britani’s family know she’s not an active member. I grew up in SLC and these type of “Mormons” drive me insane. 

First off, yes there is religious trauma in the church for sure, they have a cult like level of control and use shame on their members constantly. There is sexual abuse that gets thrown under the rug, or gets reported to church lawyers instead of law enforcement. There is toxic patriarchal male behavior (look at husband Zach from secret lives of Mormon wives) AND they are extremely anti LGBTQ+. I’m not discounting all the evil shit that goes on in Mormonism but the reality is rich white Mormons in Utah have it easy. They aren’t wondering where their next meal is. Britani has lived without real consequences and has never experienced anything close to poverty. So if a sprinter van full of successful women you are clout chasing call you out for SECRETLY RECORDING their conversation you just gotta take the L and not act dumb. She’s crying in Puerto Vallarta.

Also, no Heather, coming out as fucking your boyf outside of marriage is not the same as coming out of the closet. Britani’s tears are coming from not losing her relationship with God, but losing her access to her dad’s money. Britani is rich, she’s been taken care of her whole life. That’s what keeps a lot of people in the church is that they have rich ass family’s that have been paying for everything like all of their schooling, multiple family vacations each year, new cars, downpayment on a house, lawyer bills for your two divorces etc. It was easy for me to leave the church, my parents were broke, I had no positive experiences in the church, my parents had nothing to hold over my head besides the shame of the religion which I always thought was bullshit.

I’m sick of Mormons acting like they are some protected class of people, y’all aren’t Jewish, you don’t have to deal with a history of anti semitism, which is rising again. Mormons were the ones who wouldn’t let black people participate in the church until 1978! Mormonism is the most made up religion of all time. It’s basically a racist MLM that won’t let you have sex outside of marriage, and that marriage has to be at a special MLM temple that you pay 10% of your income to. Boo hoo if you get judged by your family, have a fucking back bone. The church is evil, homophobic, and far-right. Fuck them. I have Mormon family members I still love and care about, but all this “don’t judge me because of my religion” nonsense is bull shit, I am judging you hard AF if you are a member of the church in 2025, especially if you are a millennial or younger. I have zero sympathy for rich white Mormons in Utah. It’s a gravy train that has no real consequences. I know I sound bitter because I am, I was a poor Mormon kid that grew up around rich Mormons and it was a different world with different rules. Eat the rich Mormons lol.

I love the show and I love all the drama but this whole Britani situation and her coming out as “officially for real this time I’m not Mormon any more” just triggered me.",3,1736618691.0,rhoslc,1,1.0,False

The House of Montalvo y Estralla 

### **Chapter 7: The Blade of Accord**  

The blade rested in its sheath on Sebastián’s hip as though it had always belonged there. Its presence was a quiet declaration, a weight that made those in his orbit reassess their assumptions about him. The Blade of Accord was not simply a sword; it was an artifact of Harmony, its sleek, iridescent steel imbued with a philosophy as ancient as the twin planet itself. A philosophy that now demanded Sebastián’s reckoning.

---

### **Scene 1: A Gift’s Heavy Weight**  

In the quiet of his study, Sebastián held the sword before him, its edge catching the faint light of the oil lamp on his desk. The balance was flawless, the craftsmanship beyond anything Earth could produce. Yet the blade seemed to hum with something deeper—a resonance that matched the beat of his own heart.  

Professor Hernán Vasquez, the scholar who had studied the blade brought from Harmony, sat across from Sebastián, his sharp eyes gleaming behind wire-rimmed glasses.  

“This is not a weapon of war,” Vasquez said, his voice heavy with reverence. “The Blade of Accord is a covenant. Its edge is sharp enough to part steel, but the cost of using it to draw blood is high.”  

Sebastián frowned, his thumb brushing the engraved hilt. “Define ‘high.’”  

“The blade is forged to maintain balance, Sebastián. Harmony’s culture is built on the principle that violence corrupts, not just the world but the one who wields it. If this sword kills, it will exact a toll—on your mind, your soul, and perhaps more. It’s said that those who misuse it find their most sacred ambitions unraveling.”  

Sebastián let the words sink in, his hand tightening around the hilt. “I wonder about my nephew then. What use is it in battle?”  

Vasquez smiled faintly. “Its power is not in the taking of life but in its ability to prevent it. The sight of the Blade of Accord alone can turn warriors into diplomats. If you carry it, Sebastián, you carry a promise—to wield it with wisdom, or not at all.”  

---

### **Scene 2: Philosophy in Practice**  

The air at the Iron Spine construction site hung heavy with tension. Smoke from recent sabotage still lingered, mingling with the metallic tang of fear and resentment. Workers had gathered, drawn by the promise of Governor Sebastián Montalvo’s arrival.  

When Sebastián dismounted and approached the saboteur, the Blade of Accord at his hip shimmered like a living thing, as though aware of the charged atmosphere.  

Diego, a wiry young man bound and kneeling in the dirt, glared up at Sebastián with defiance. His face was bruised, his wrists raw from the rope biting into his skin, but his spirit remained unbroken.  

Sebastián unsheathed the Blade of Accord, its edge catching the sunlight and drawing a collective gasp from the crowd.  

“This sword is no ordinary weapon,” Sebastián said, his voice carrying above the murmurs. “It is the Blade of Accord, forged on Harmony—a blade that weighs the heart of the one who wields it.”  

He stepped closer, his gaze locking with Diego’s. “You sabotaged this project because you believe in something. So do I. But belief without understanding is dangerous. I will give you a choice, Diego.”  

The crowd fell silent as Sebastián knelt, placing the sword on the ground between them. “Pick up the blade. Strike me down, if you think it will prove your cause.”  

Gasps erupted from the onlookers. General Márquez moved forward, his face a mask of alarm. “Governor—”  

Sebastián raised a hand to silence him. His eyes never left Diego’s. “You claim to fight for the people. Show them what kind of man you are.”  

Diego hesitated, his defiance faltering. Then, with a sharp intake of breath, he lunged for the sword.  

---

### **Scene 3: The Blade’s Judgment**  

The moment Diego grasped the hilt, the Blade of Accord pulsed with a subtle, otherworldly glow. A hush fell over the crowd as he rose, the sword trembling in his hands.  

“You think I won’t do it?” Diego snarled, his voice shaking.  

“I think you will,” Sebastián said calmly, stepping closer. “And I think the blade will judge us both.”  

Diego roared, lifting the sword high. He thrust it toward Sebastián’s chest, but the governor moved with swift precision. He deflected the strike with his forearm, twisting to avoid a killing blow. The blade grazed his arm, slicing through cloth and flesh.  

Blood splattered onto the dirt.  

For a moment, nothing happened. Then the Blade of Accord flared to life, its glow surging into Diego’s hands. His eyes widened in terror as the energy coursed through him.  

The crowd watched, stunned, as Diego staggered back. His defiance crumbled, replaced by a wave of agony. He dropped the sword, clutching his chest as though an unseen force was crushing him from within.  

“No,” he gasped, falling to his knees. “What… what is this?”  

Sebastián picked up the blade, his blood staining its hilt. He turned to the crowd, his voice steady despite the pain in his arm.  

“This is the cost of wielding power without understanding,” he said, raising the sword for all to see. “The Blade of Accord demands harmony—not just in the wielder’s hand, but in their heart. Diego struck out of anger, and the blade punished him for it. Let this be a lesson to us all.”  

Diego sobbed, his strength fading. The glow of the blade dimmed, leaving him hunched and broken in the dirt.  

---

### **Scene 4: Aftermath**  

Sebastián allowed the medics to tend to his wound while the workers dispersed, their murmurs carrying tales of what they had witnessed. General Márquez approached, his face pale.  

“You took an incredible risk,” Márquez said, his voice low. “What if he’d killed you?”  

Sebastián smiled faintly, the weight of the sword heavier than ever. “The blade wouldn’t have allowed it.”  

“Are you certain?” Márquez asked.  

Sebastián didn’t answer. He wasn’t certain. The Blade of Accord had its own will, its own laws, and he was only beginning to understand them.  

---

### **Scene 4: A Sister’s Doubts**  

Far from the construction site, Estrella received word of the incident over breakfast. She leaned back in her chair, swirling her coffee as she listened to the report.  

“So,” she mused, “my brother lets a saboteur strike him and uses it to preach philosophy. Bold, even for Sebastián.”  

Her aide shifted uncomfortably. “The workers seem inspired by his actions. They’re calling him… unbreakable.”  

Estrella’s lips curved into a sly smile. “Unbreakable? We’ll see about that.”  

She set down her coffee and turned to a map spread across the table. “Every blade has its breaking point. Even his precious Blade of Accord.”  

---

### **Scene 6: A Duel of Wills**  

Later that night, Sebastián faced a greater challenge: his own doubt. Alone in his quarters, he unsheathed the Blade of Accord once more, its edge glinting in the moonlight.  

He thought of his father, who had taught him that strength was the foundation of leadership. He thought of Estrella, whose whispers of dissent grew louder with each passing day. And he thought of Harmony, a planet where peace was not the absence of conflict but the mastery of it.  

“What kind of leader will you be?” he murmured, his reflection distorted in the blade.  

The answer did not come easily. Leadership was not about perfection; it was about choices. The Blade of Accord was not a weapon—it was a mirror, forcing him to confront the man he was and the man he wanted to be.  

---

### **Scene 7: Consequences of Harmony**  

The next morning, word of Diego’s release spread across the region. Workers whispered of Sebastián’s mercy, while his enemies saw it as weakness. Estrella, hearing of the event, smiled as she sipped her morning coffee.  

“He’s playing with fire,” she mused to General Márquez during a private meeting. “Harmony’s philosophy may guide him, but Earth is far less forgiving. The Blade of Accord may protect him from its own consequences, but it will not protect him from mine.”  

Márquez shifted uncomfortably. “He’s gained the workers’ respect. That could complicate your plans.”  

Estrella’s smile widened. “Respect is fleeting. Fear endures. Let him have his philosophy, General. I have no intention of fighting fair.”  ",1,1736618547.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

I’m a student who’s been surviving on instant coffee sachets (think Nescafe/BRU), but I want to switch to actual coffee and start brewing at home. I’m really curious about the whole process, but I have a few questions before taking the plunge:

1. Cost: Are coffee grounds or beans cheaper (brewing at home in general)  in the long run compared to instant coffee sachets? Convincing my dad to spend a hefty ammount what what is essentially a foreign concept to him is difficult.

2. Brewing guide: As a complete beginner, what’s the easiest and most affordable brewing method to start with? I don’t have any equipment right now.

3. Is it worth it? I know good coffee is a different world altogether, but is it practical and budget-friendly for a student?

Would love to hear your experiences or recommendations on brands, brewing methods, or ways to keep the costs down. Thanks in advance!

# Who is this for?

Marquise cut diamonds are ideal for:

* Those seeking a unique, eye-catching engagement ring
* Individuals who appreciate vintage aesthetics
* Buyers wanting a diamond that appears larger than its carat weight

# Who is this not for?

Marquise cuts may not suit:

* Those preferring classic, widely accepted diamond shapes
* Individuals concerned about potential light performance issues
* Buyers looking for the highest resale value

# Recommendations for smart buying:

1. Prioritize cut quality: Use ASET and Ideal Scope images to assess light performance.
2. Pay attention to symmetry: Ensure the two halves mirror each other perfectly.
3. Consider the bowtie effect: Opt for stones with minimal dark areas in the center.
4. Choose protective settings: Prong settings help safeguard the vulnerable pointed ends.
5. Aim for SI1 or SI2 clarity grades for the best value.
6. Compare prices across reputable retailers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

# FAQ

1. What's the ideal length-to-width ratio for a marquise diamond?Most experts recommend a ratio between 1.70 and 2.15, but personal preference plays a role.
2. Are marquise diamonds more prone to chipping?The pointed ends can be vulnerable, but proper settings and care minimize this risk.
3. How does the price of marquise diamonds compare to round brilliants?

Marquise cuts are generally less expensive, with a 1-carat stone averaging around $4,000.

1. What's the ""bowtie effect"" in marquise diamonds?It's a dark area across the center of the stone. A slight bowtie is normal, but excessive darkness can detract from the diamond's beauty.

Remember, choosing a marquise cut diamond requires careful consideration of its unique characteristics. Take your time, compare options, and don't hesitate to seek expert advice to find the perfect stone for you.

Happy new year!  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in Europe thank you.

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

### **Chapter One: Echoes Across the Divide**  

The chancery fortress on Harmony stood like a beacon of calculated defiance, a testament to Puerto Rico’s bold leap into the interstellar age. Situated at the edge of Sol’s shadow on the twin planet, its polished stone walls reflected not only the brilliance of its architects but also the weight of its purpose. Inside, two Americans sat in a secluded chamber, the air between them thick with the residue of half-formed doubts and unanswered questions.  

Ambassador William Eckhart adjusted his tie for the third time in as many minutes, his brow furrowed as he flipped through a digital dossier. Opposite him, Marianne Halloway sipped her coffee, her gaze fixed on the table but her thoughts clearly elsewhere.  

“They played us,” Eckhart finally muttered, his tone edged with frustration.  

Marianne raised an eyebrow but said nothing.  

“The Puerto Ricans built all this”—he gestured vaguely around the room—“while we were too busy bickering over jurisdiction back on Earth. And now, what? They’ve locked down the trade routes, fortified their diplomatic foothold, and managed to make us look like overreaching fools.”  

Marianne set her cup down with deliberate care. “And yet, here we are, maintaining their fortress on this planet. That doesn’t exactly scream modesty, does it?”  

“Not when you consider the cost,” Eckhart shot back. “We’re footing the bill for maintenance, for security, for trade patrols. Meanwhile, their partners—South America, the Caribbean nations—they don’t have to pay a cent. It’s a free ride for them, and we’re stuck playing the bad guys in the eyes of the colonies.”  

Marianne leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. “So, what’s your solution? Pull out entirely? Leave the trade routes undefended and watch the entire system collapse? Harmony is an opportunity for the Americans as well”  

Eckhart scowled but didn’t respond immediately. His silence was answer enough.  

Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella. He entered the room with the kind of unhurried confidence that came from years of balancing impossible responsibilities. His tailored suit was as sharp as his gaze, and the Blade of Accord, a symbol of his unexpected rise to prominence in the system, hung discreetly at his side.  

“Ambassador Eckhart, Ms. Halloway,” Sebastián greeted them, his voice calm yet commanding. “I trust you’re finding the accommodations satisfactory?”  

Eckhart stood, clearing his throat. “Governor Montalvo, they’re... adequate. Though I must admit, your fortress here seems more prepared for war than diplomacy.”  

Sebastián’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Harmony has taught us that the line between the two is often thinner than we’d like. But rest assured, Ambassador, Puerto Rico seeks not conflict but stability—for Harmony, for Earth, and for all those who tread the paths between them.”  

“Stability at whose expense?” Eckhart asked, his tone sharper than he intended.  

Marianne shot him a warning glance, but Sebastián didn’t seem fazed.  

“At an expense no one country should be ladened with, Ambassador,” Sebastián replied evenly. “We’ve taken the burden of initiative, yes, but only because we see what’s at stake. The question, Ambassador, is whether the Americans are willing to see it through as well.”  

The tension in the room was palpable, but before either American could respond, another voice joined the fray.  

“Bold words, Governor. But words don’t untangle centuries of legal knots.”  

All eyes turned to Isabella Vélez-Campo as she stepped into the room, her presence as sharp and precise as the legal arguments she was known for. She nodded to the Americans before turning her attention to Sebastián.  

“Have you briefed them on the Articles yet?” she asked, her tone all business.  

Sebastián shook his head. “I thought I’d leave that honor to you.”  

Isabella’s lips curved into a faint smile as she approached the table, setting a tablet down in front of Eckhart. “Then allow me to explain. The Vienna Convention on Intraplanetary Diplomatic Relations—the so-called playbook for our system's diplomacy—was written for a world that no longer exists. If you truly want to understand what Puerto Rico is building here, you’ll need to start by understanding how outdated systems are being reshaped.”  

Marianne glanced at Sebastián, then back at Isabella. “And you think you can reshape those systems without stepping on a few toes?”  

Isabella met her gaze without flinching. “We’re not here to step on toes, Ms. Halloway. We’re here to prove that a new way forward is not only possible but necessary.”  

The conversation hung in the air, a fragile thread connecting ambition, skepticism, and the tenuous promise of progress. Outside, the shadow of Harmony stretched across the landscape, a reminder that every light cast its share of darkness.",1,1736618437.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

- The double shot 🥃 is HUGE - half fills an 8oz coffee cup - I've seen 60ml thrown around as a default setting which is wild to me

- A single shot is too short

- Single+ seems to be closer to what I'd call a standard double shot

Is it possible to amend the default ml sizes for shot size?

I got up to throw my container away and wasn't paying attention to my swallowing. I kinda gagged a little on it and then swallowed it.

So the next day I go to drink my coffee in the morning, I go to swallow and gag to the point that I spit it out. Tried again, same thing. Tried some eggs & toast, nope gagging. Everything I try to eat and drink I gag and can't swallow. The really weird thing is I can down a whole glass of water when I first wake up in the morning. Then once I'm up for a few minutes I'm back to gagging. I am really afraid that nobody is going to be able to help me with this. I've lost 15 lbs from lack of eating. I don't know what to do.

I have a Shokz bone conduction headset which I love because I can comfortably wear it all day without impacting me from hearing my surroundings or conversations. I'm in and out of Teams calls all day so they work great for me.

When I'm sitting at my desk though, I'd really like to try a pair of ANC earbuds to block out ambient noise and maybe have some light music. If I'm getting up to head to the coffee maker or somebody walks in, I can just pop out the earbuds - but I'd still have the Shokz on if someone calls (or I'm sneaking away during a call 🙂)

So ultmately the question is: since the bone conducting headset doesn't rely on sound actually entering my eardrums, would they be impacted by having ANC earbuds in at the same time?

The main training service that people are interested in are the board and train programs. To try and make it affordable and accessible to all dog owners, I offer payment plans. I recently had a client go home with their dog and they were on a payment plan. They have not continued to work the dog at home or look over any of the resources provided to them to help them continue their training at home and are now refusing to pay their installments on the payment plan because they state their dog has not retrained any training. 

My board and train programs come with almost daily training videos that go over how a command or behavior is being trained in and why it's being trained in the way that it is. It goes over a step by step process of everything that is done from shaping basic commands such as sit, down, stay, heel all the way to leash walking and e collar training/off leash work. I also provide training videos of all the training field trips to pet friendly stores, parks/hiking areas, coffee shops, and breweries the dog gets taken too. At pick up, the owner gets a go home session that goes over everything the dog has learned as well as handling lessons so they know how to utilize tools such as the leash and e collar as well as timing for rewarding. They go over what commands to say and when. This client made several comments during the training program about how impressed she was with the progress, she also had one of the best go home sessions and handling with her dog I have personally witnessed. It was very smooth and the dog took to listening and following through with commands with no issues. 

I'm frustrated with this as I go above and beyond what many large training facilities do and offer for dog training. For the owner to state that the dog isn't trained and now she is refusing to pay for services rendered, it feels ridiculous. I'll be heading over to do a private lesson with her to see what's going on with the training and her dog tomorrow to see how I can best help find a solution. Overall, what would you do if the owner continues to not pay? She owes roughly $2,000 so it's not something that I'm just going to say ""forget it"" about. 

To add even extra fun flair to this issue, I'm going on 37 weeks pregnant and was pretty much going to be on ""maternity leave"" after her dog and 1 other training dog had gone home. So if I do have to go and persue something such as small claims, what does that process look like?

TLDR: Client received dog training, there is proof of training, however, she is struggling to get the dog to listen or engage with her at home. Client is refusing to pay for training ($2000 balance). What would you do? ",1,1736617666.0,smallbusiness,2,0.67,False

That made me think that, man, so much has changed. The ones that stick out from my memory:

* The game didn't always have an ending. You finished the community center, get grandpa's evaluation, then you kinda just keep existing. No wizard buildings, ginger island, perfection tracker, etc.
* Coffee was not a crop. You just had to buy the drink if you wanted to run skull caverns.
* Sheds didn't exist. I still made my fortune with wine, but I had to just cram kegs everywhere on the overworld like the quarry and the backwoods.
* Return scepter didn't exist, BUT you could temporarily pause time by opening your journal and very slowly hobble to your house by opening and closing it every time you were about to pass out.
* Obelisks didn't exist (cause no wizard quest). You always had to wait for Pam to drive you to the desert at 10 am.
* No desert trader either, so all of my gems just got sold almost immediately, and omni-geodes were a nightmare to process.
* Beds were immovable. They were just anchored to the floor, and you couldn't knock out the walls to make it easier to get in either.
* Buildings were immovable. If you wanted to move your max level barns one square over, you had to tear them down and build them again (it happened more than once).
* Chests were always brown, and did not have the ""fill existing stacks"" button. You either had good organization, or 2-3 chests with the same item because you forgot where it's supposed to go.
* Shane and Emily were not eligible marriage candidates. That's why they (still) send you recipes, but the other candidates don't.
* Dinosaur eggs just made gold-quality mayo, not dino mayo. I think void eggs couldn't become mayo at all, and you HAD to get them from the witch event because Krobus wasn't selling them at the time.

For the past few years I couldn't break free from homeless in South Carolina until now, but that now comes with a ""however"". 

The ""however"", despite making incredible gains in regards to credit, credit limits, and knowledge of how I'm going to move forward to a good life it unfortunately all depends on one thing, or rather one place.
That place in Charleston SC.
Unfortunately, during my homeless life there i got tired of being kicked around by the police and finally ended up in an altercation with one.
Currently I'm living with relatives a state away during which time I've written a book, worked on my finances, educated myself in numerous studies, made some investments in crypto, created an apparel line I'm about to launch, building a website revolving around Amazon, and I've made plans for my future I'm adamantly and borderline crazy obsessed with moving to NYC or nearby NYC.

The negative of the outcome from the situation is I'm facing 5 years imprisonment for punching a cop. At the least there's probation but that would confine me to being homeless in South Carolina, specifically in Charleston where I'll no doubt have to resort to crime thereby going in an indefinite circle with police and the courts whilst the community suffers from whatever it is i end up doing. It's possible I may end up in jail for good which end up causing more issues.
The positive is so far , after a whole year, a trial date hasn't been set so if it gets dropped i never have to nor will I ever care to be in Charleston or even near it ever again whether they ban me from the county or not.
Honestly,  they can ban me from the whole state of South Carolina because I'm tired of the southeast. 
Why am I here ranting?
I love NYC. I'm absolutely obsessed with it: the diversity, the festivities, the entertainment, the fact I could go shopping or get a coffee at 3am if I wanted. The music venues, the arts, the food, the endless things to do list.
Of course I'm hoping these speeches reach the ears of those who decide whether I end up stuck in Charleston SC or get to leave for good but I also just need to say how much I want to live in NYC.
While NYC has its downsides of negative people as expected from a city with millions living there and millions visiting yearly, or costs of living (which I'm not worried about), the upsides of NYC far outway any downside and that's reflected by the amount of people living there, moving there, and visiting there.
Life, I've come to realize is about 3 things:
#1 Logistical Management which requires understanding your aspirations and where and how those are best served. Where one place isn't working you may need to adjust your strategy to how you do things and that might mean moving somewhere else. It may mean getting creative off line or online. #2 Risk Management which requires understanding the risks involved in every decision you make financially and health-wise.
It's important to list the positives as well as the negatives of your decisions and understand how it might affect not you but others because karma can be a you know what.
Better decisions are made with a healthier brain.
The healthier your brain the healthier your creative and critical thinking skills are.
It might surprise you to know that the heart is essentially another brain so take of it.
#3 Time Management which is self explanatory and needs no input from me other than knowing life is better lived depending on your circadian rhythm which might surprise many to know that depending on what time you were born could affect your brains processing for example I was born at 12.01 am in a northern climate Ohio which would mean my brains day starts after 12.01 am and is better suited to a northern climate like NYC.
That's all. Please try to be kind to one another. 
Life is too short to waste with silly arguments and unreasonable decisions. 
And before I forget.....
YURRRR! 😁

I'm allergic to nuts and highly sensitive to an cross contamination. I'm craving a fresh hot chocolate that's not from a packet but every coffee shop I've been to have nut milks as non dairy options. This means the steamer has come been used with nut milk and that's too much of a risk even if they run the steamer between each drink. I'm okay with other non-dairy milks. 

I'm open to coffee shop that has dedicated steamers or has some alternative methods that use to heat up the milk. I can't use those push button machines like at 7-11 because I'm also super allergic to coffee and it's hard to tell if coffee had been previously used where the hot chocolate came out. 

DISCLAIMER: I am aware that there is always a risk of cross contamination and I would always discuss with the barista/manager prior to ordering to determine if how they would do it would be too risky. I'm just trying to narrow down my options so that I'm not calling every coffee shop in the DMV area. I also know there are ways to make at home. I just miss going out with friends to coffee shops and enjoying a drink with them that's not iced. ",13,1736616895.0,nova,19,0.71,False

And I haven't been able to improve myself. I want to genuinely get better, move out of my grandparents house, and maybe move on with my life, leaving behind my mother's emotional torture, thoughts of my absent and hateful father and the family I'm don't feel I'm a part of. I always feel left out in this family, considering I am the child of a single mother, who may be an excellent provider, but is quite emotionally taxing. I am fed up with being called names and she bothers me daily about my weight, how I look like a pig. (I'm 18F, 78kgs) For some reason, my mother is the only person who's ever bullied me for my weight, no classmates ever said that to me, no one else, just her. I'm also preparing for an exam, in which I failed once already, so having to study again, now with only a few weeks left for the exam, I'm quite terrified. I've not been scoring well in my mock exams, and I honestly have the very little time left to do something good. I have to score well in this exam to get a decent college, witch decent scores so she doesn't have to pay the extremely high fee.

Now- the challenges I need to tackle:

1. My academics- My syllabus needs to be completed, and I need to get better at question solving.
2. My body- I need to lose 20 kilos by March- a little unrealistic, I know. But by 20 March, I need to be down 20 kgs.
3. My mental health- I need to learn how to ignore, and stop thinking about the past, and people who shouldn't matter, because once I'm out of this house, I'll find a way to move out of the country after college.

Now, what will I do for all of the problems- aka, solutions:  
**1. Weight loss-**

a. Intermittent Fasting- 16:8 - 12pm to 8pm eating window.  
b. 1200 calorie intake daily.  
And for working out (6 days a week to the gym)  
c. Monday, Wednesday, Friday - GYM- 1 hour cardio + 30 minutes simple weight training. (Following the PPL routine.)  
d.  Tuesday, Thursday- Weighted Pilates in the gym.  
e. Gym in the mornings thus running to and fro the gym.  
f. Sundays- 1.5 hour morning walk/run from 5 to 6:30 am.  
g. Taking electrolytes such as Gatorade or electrolyte powder while working out, and also taking 60g protein daily. (Protein shake, Protein yogurt, Tofu, Egg whites, Chicken breast.)  
h. Water- 2 to 2.5 litres daily  
i. Now, I will be indulging in some slightly unhealthy habits- such as coke zero, and sugar free gum for cravings and suppressing hunger.  
j. Oats for breakfast daily, with bananas. Eggs for lunch, or sometimes simple salads. Dinner eggs again, or chicken, or salad. (I need to stop eating atp, lol /j)

**2. Academics-**

a. I need to complete my course by the end of January positively- so about *12 hours* of studying daily. (I can't sit still for longer than 2 hours, so, I'm aiming too high, but I've got no option. Mine's quite literally a do or die situation.)  
b. Get thorough with the chapters and revision (at least twice) by Feb 15th.  
c. Solve question papers myself from 30th Jan onwards.

I do get hungry a lot while I study, so I will eat fruits, cucumbers or carrots just in case. And also, to stay awake and alert, caffeine should help. I have caffeine pills with L-theanine, and I won't over do them, but they rarely help anyways. I prefer coffee instead for the taste and of course, wakefulness at times.  
I'd be keeping my diet coke/ coke zero and gum in handy just in case again. But since I also need to sleep, because I have to drive to my morning classes at times, I'll sleep by 2 and wake up by 6 and sleep for 2 to 3 hours in the evening.

Now, as for my Mental Health- It will fix itself when my body and academics reach my desired goal.

My mother's crazy obsessed with me, my weight and my academics, and spends a little too much on my *studies*, so I should be able to make it with the resources I've got. I'll do this for myself and for her, because I do love her, but I don't like her.

I think there's one last thing- To clear my skin. I've got crazy eczema that flares up quite frequently, and is really painful. With the added stress, it gets really bad at times. So that's another thing I need for to get better before summer, where the sweat and heat makes it too sticky, slightly unlike the winters where the skin only gets dry, flaky and really red. (The burning is quite same in both the seasons.)

Goal- Make it to my dream college.  
Reach 55 kgs before April 30th.

I didn't trust our waiter to properly go over my N/A drink options since he described the wine flight as ""lucrative"", back of the house voice. I decided to go up to the bar to ask more questions. She pointed to the menu and the N/A cocktails so I decided to go back to the table and order one with the waiter. The menu drink descriptions were of the alcohol version of the drink, vodka, coffee liquor ECT, with N/A on side. So at the table I am asking the waiter how are the going to make the espresso martini N/A. He had to ask and then came back to the table saying the vodka would be replaced with simple syrup and the espresso liquor would be coffee. So I will be spending $14 on sugar coffee. I pivoted to sparkling water three 🍒. The sparkling water was not brought to the table until middle of the meal, no cherries and bottle cap not removed (not a twist off). I handed the bottle him and he tries open with his bare hand. The whole thing was awkward and brought attention to me not drinking. 
This morning I was still frustrated. Mostly because I had to spend time discussing my situation, that sucks. I really just want to make this choice without so much fuss. 

The end of the day this was a service issue and that's it. I just didn't like having to negotiate it. Even though I am 215 days in my friends haven't really noticed. This is the first time where I didn't have a plan for my N/A order. ",5,1736616361.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

1hz0kb6,https://i.redd.it/uagdetvldece1.jpeg,Tuning In: Are You Truly Feeling It? • [Click to Expand] ,"## The Subtle Art of Feeling: A Journey to Connection and Awareness



Let’s have a conversation, just you and me. I want to ask you a question, and I really want you to pause for a moment before you answer: Are you feeling it? Don’t just brush past it. Take a second to sit with it. What does “it” even mean to you? It could be joy, pain, love, or maybe just the rhythm of life itself. Whatever comes to mind, that’s where we’ll start.  

Now, let me tell you why I’m asking. A few years ago, I found myself sitting at the edge of a dock by a quiet lake. The air was crisp, the kind of crisp that bites your skin but makes you feel alive. I remember staring at the water, watching the ripples chase each other endlessly. In that moment, I realized something profound: I wasn’t *feeling* anything. I wasn’t present with the scene in front of me. My mind was racing—work deadlines, social obligations, a million little worries that seemed important but, in hindsight, weren’t.  

It hit me then: how often do we go through life on autopilot, completely disconnected from the world around us? It’s not that I didn’t care about the beauty of the lake; it’s that I didn’t know how to tune in.  

### The Pursuit of Feeling  
In a way, the question “Are you feeling it?” is an invitation—a call to wake up to life’s textures, both rough and smooth. But it’s not always easy, is it? We live in a world that glorifies distraction. Our phones buzz with notifications, our schedules overflow with commitments, and before we know it, we’re too busy *doing* to focus on *being*.  

Let’s think about this for a second. How often do we truly let ourselves feel? Not just the big moments, like falling in love or grieving a loss, but the quiet, everyday things. The warmth of sunlight on your face. The sound of rain tapping against the window. The laugh of a friend. These moments are everywhere, but they’re easy to miss if we’re not paying attention.  

And here’s the kicker: feeling isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes, it means sitting with pain or discomfort instead of running from it. But there’s power in that. There’s growth. When we allow ourselves to feel, we’re saying yes to the full spectrum of human experience.  

### The Fear of Feeling  
I’ve noticed that many of us are scared to feel deeply. Maybe it’s because emotions can be messy and unpredictable. They don’t fit neatly into the boxes we try to create for them. But what if we stopped seeing that messiness as a problem? What if we embraced it as part of being alive?  

I remember a friend once told me, “I don’t cry at movies because I don’t want to seem weak.” That stuck with me. Why is vulnerability so often mistaken for weakness? Crying at a movie, laughing so hard your stomach hurts, admitting you’re scared—these are the moments when we’re most human. They’re when we’re most alive.  

### Feeling Through Connection  
Now, let’s shift gears a bit. Feeling isn’t something we do in isolation; it’s deeply tied to connection. Think about the last time you had a heart-to-heart conversation with someone. Not small talk, but a real, soul-baring conversation. How did that feel? My guess is, it left you feeling seen, understood, maybe even lighter.  

Connection is one of the most profound ways we experience life. It’s in the way a baby clings to their parent’s finger. It’s in the silent comfort of sitting beside someone you love. It’s in the shared laughter of friends reminiscing about old times.  

But here’s the thing: to connect with others, we first have to connect with ourselves. If we’re not in tune with our own feelings, how can we truly understand someone else’s?  

### Practical Steps to Start Feeling It  
Okay, this all sounds nice in theory, but what does it look like in practice? Here’s what I’ve learned from my own journey:  

1. **Slow Down:** Life moves fast, but you don’t have to. Take a moment each day to pause and notice what’s around you. Maybe it’s the colors of the sky at sunset or the way your coffee tastes in the morning. These little pauses can make a big difference.  

2. **Check In with Yourself:** Ask yourself how you’re feeling—not just physically, but emotionally. Are you happy? Stressed? Content? Naming your emotions is the first step to understanding them.  

3. **Be Present:** This one’s tricky, especially with so many distractions around us. But try this: the next time you’re with a friend, put your phone away and really listen to them. Notice their tone of voice, their body language. Be there, fully.  

4. **Embrace Discomfort:** Feeling isn’t always fun, but it’s necessary. When tough emotions come up, instead of pushing them away, try sitting with them. What are they teaching you?  

5. **Find Joy in the Small Things:** Joy doesn’t always come from big, dramatic events. Sometimes, it’s in the smell of freshly baked cookies or the sound of your favorite song. Let yourself savor these moments.  

### The Ripple Effect of Feeling  
When you start feeling more, something amazing happens: it ripples out into every part of your life. You become more empathetic, more grounded, more alive. And this doesn’t just benefit you; it impacts everyone around you.  

Imagine a world where people weren’t afraid to feel. Where we all allowed ourselves to experience life fully, without numbing the hard parts or rushing past the good ones. That’s a world I’d want to live in.  

So, I’ll ask you again: Are you feeling it? And if you’re not, what’s one small step you can take today to start? Remember, it’s not about getting it perfect; it’s about showing up. It’s about being willing to feel, even when it’s messy, even when it’s hard.  

Because at the end of the day, feeling is what makes us human. It’s what connects us, heals us, and reminds us that we’re alive. And isn’t that the whole point?

She gets her nails done, I walk about, usually go to the Museum and have a coffee than we go to lunch.

Last couple times we've been we've had the strangest interactions with complete strangers while minding our own business. 

Last time my partner was waiting outside the museum, near the bus stop for me when a stranger in a suit asked her for directions. She was polite and gave them to him. Then he asked for money and got right into her personal space, she said she didn't have cash and he told her to f off. 

This time I'm sitting in Kelvingrove Museum cafe just browsing my phone, waiting for my partner to finish her nails. A guy probably in his 60s comes up and asks if he can sit at my table. I nod and say go ahead. 

Then he keeps trying to talk to me, asking me where I'm from, asking to shake my hand. He asks me why I'm here, I say I'm waiting for my partner to get her nails done. He says 'oh yes, good line.' I just said um, ok.. what do you mean by that exactly? 'just what I said, good line' Then he goes to the loo and asks me to keep an eye on his stuff. Then he comes back and starts mocking me for browsing my phone. 'oh yes, just stare at your phone, I'd stare at my phone all the time if I had a pocket for it'. Something like that anyway, he kept going on about it while I'm trying to just mind my own business and drink my coffee. 

Anyway, I just lost my patience, looked at him and said 'you're a rude man aren't you. I'm allowed to look at my phone if I want to, it's my business not yours.'. He finally got up and moved. I'm ashamed to say I called him a 'fucking dickhead' as he left that table and went to another one. 

Then another older gentleman asked if he could sit at the table. I said go ahead. The other guy who'd just been accostibg me starts mocking the new guy about his scarf from across the cafe. I told the new guy to ignore him and he replied that you get some odd balls around here. Then we had a very pleasant conversation. 

I then walk to go meet my partner. First thing she says is she's basically just been accosted again.

- Started using a HYSA in Sept 2023. I’ve since accrued $2,700 (pre-tax).
- Started shopping at Aldi in 2024 vs. Kroger. It saved me $700 in grocery spend.
- Shopped at Costco for paper products, condiments, dairy, alcohol, toiletries, and coffee. Saves me $1,000 annually (mostly from the coffee actually lol).
- Got a job closer to home and changed car mechanics (I was lowkey being ripped off). Saved me $1,800 in 2024.
- Got rid of a streaming service any time I wanted to add a new streaming service. Netted me even for the year at $600 annually in both 2023 and 2024.
- Invested in the things I needed for my house (purchased in 2021) then took this past year off to enjoy what I did. Cut housing spend to 1/3 of what it was in 2022.
- Paid off my car loans in 2023. Took all that money and rolled it into paying my student loans. Paid $7K in student loans in 2024. Only $7K left to go.

I feel betrayed and lost.","Hi everyone, I’m writing this to share what I’ve been through because it’s weighing heavily on me. I (30M) was in an online relationship with a woman (42F) for around 4 months before everything fell apart. We met on an **adult video chat site** where she was working as a host. I know it’s an unusual way to meet someone, but despite the circumstances, I truly believed we had a deep connection.

We began texting constantly—good mornings, good nights, daily conversations. I gave her all my emotional support and affection. During this time, I also spent money just to talk to her on the platform and support her. Later, we moved our conversations to Snapchat and then WhatsApp, and I thought things were becoming more personal and intimate.

In our conversations, we built so many dreams together. We talked about how amazing it would be to spend time together in person, how we would hold hands while exploring the city, watch movies together, share simple but meaningful moments like cooking breakfast or having a coffee. We even planned specific places to visit in Belgium and dreamed about how beautiful it would be to create lasting memories. I was counting down the days until I could make those dreams real.

However, about a month before I was supposed to travel to Belgium, I started to notice her becoming more distant. She wasn’t as responsive, and her messages felt less affectionate. I ignored it at first, convincing myself that she was just stressed from adjusting to her new life. But deep down, I felt like something was wrong.

She would ask me things like, “When will you tell your family about me?” or “Do you think your family would accept someone like me?” She believed my family wouldn’t approve of her because of her past, her job, and the fact that she was older than me. But despite all of this, I assured her that I was ready to stand by her side no matter what and that I was even prepared to face my family if I had to. I wanted her to know that my love for her wasn’t conditional or fragile.

After I got to Belgium, my fears were confirmed. I found out she had been seeing someone else (30M) from the same adult video chat community. What hurt the most was that she had been confiding in him about everything—**our relationship, our plans, my trip to see her.** This man knew everything about us because she had told him everything.

The truth hit me hard: he had already confessed his feelings to her before I arrived, and they had gone out together—something she hid from me by saying her mom was sick. When I confronted her later, she justified her actions by saying, “We weren’t officially together.” But how could I have known that when she was still messaging me every day, telling me she missed me, and making me believe we had a future together?

What made it harder was that this man lived in a country very close to Belgium, making it easier for him to visit her frequently. I, on the other hand, live in a country much farther away, and it wasn’t as simple for me to see her whenever I wanted. Despite the distance, I took the leap, traveled to see her, and believed that my commitment and effort would mean something.

She later told me that she chose him because “he understands what I need,” implying that I, someone her age considered too inexperienced, didn’t. She admitted that their relationship probably wouldn’t last long because his family didn’t approve of her due to her age, past work, and the fact that she was divorced with a child.

In the end, I was left with emotional scars and financial debt after trying so hard to build something real. I supported her dreams and believed in her, yet she betrayed my trust. I was prepared to stand against all odds to be with her, but it seems I was the only one willing to fight for our future. Now, I’m trying to accept the reality that sometimes, no matter how much you care or sacrifice, some people will still choose the easier path over real love.

  
How can I move on from this experience without constantly feeling like I was ""not enough""? I believed in her, gave her everything I could, and made sacrifices, but she still chose someone else. How do I stop comparing myself to the person she chose and let go of the idea that I wasn’t worthy of the relationship?",1,1736615166.0,relationship_advice,11,0.6,False

I used to make them years ago as a restaurant server, so have some experience there. The Bambino and Encore seemed to be the most consistently recommended budget entry. I also had already been using a regular Encore for quite a while with my aeropress.

I cannot get dialed in. I have tried a variety of beans, including fresh from local roasters, and store bought.

Equipment: coffee scale, wdt, calibrated tamper (30lb), bottomless portafilter, single walled non-pressurized basket that came with the bambino.

For what its worth, I found out after a bit that the quick release knob on the encore was loose, I tightened it (and now it is stuck...dealing with customer service though they haven't offered much help yet).

Currently using medium roast Colombian beans. Locally roasted on 12/20/24.

One very consistent thing is I cannot really ever go past grind 16 with any beans. Anything lower chokes the machine. Sometimes getting choked even at grind 17-18.

I have played around with dose. From 16-18g (18g Bambino basket).

The Bambino manual says a shot should drop between 8-12 seconds.

Any combination of variables leads to either a late drop or choking. Always spraying. If I manage to get no spraying, it drops very late. If I get even close to a 12 second drop or earlier (rare), it sprays a lot.

There are a few issues with this model that's expected for a decade old rifle. They are:

* Missing c-clip/retaining clip for handguard pin (can be purchased from Amazon, Home Depot, Cantire)
* One of the rear metal pins to secure stock to lower receiver is missing (can be purchased from PTS Steel Shop website)
* Bolt release feature is faulty. You must manually pull the bolt a bit to release it from its locked position when adjusting hopup.
* One of the midcap mags have mag feeding issue due to weak spring. You can remedy this by replacing the decade old worn out spring with a new one.

Regarding the metal body pin. I can manually measure using a caliper so you can find a similar one from your local store or home hardware center. Same with the retaining clip.

* ~~Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans~~
* ~~FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games~~
* ~~eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot~~
* ~~4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box~~
* ~~Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included~~
* ~~One metal M-lok rail adapter included~~
* ~~The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors~~
* ~~Original box and manual included~~

~~This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.~~

~~Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.~~

Story: today, I did a lot of activities without any enjoyment. Even gaming felt dull. Tonight, I started overthinking: *Why and how can’t I feel enjoyment?* The answer was that I kept focusing on *fun* and *goals.* Once I let go of those two things and started enjoying the process, I felt joy in gaming again (like enjoying the gameplay), not the winning or goals.

I know this is about gaming, but I can’t wait to apply this 'enjoying the process' trick to other aspects tomorrow, other than entertainment ofc. Wish me luck, and I wish you luck too!

However, some experts say using too much salt at home can have negative effects on the environment.

That’s where “Salt Smart” comes into play.

Boone County and the University of Missouri jointly use the practice to reduce the amount of salt that reaches local creeks and streams.

“Salt Smart is the idea of using salt appropriately when we need it,” Michele Woolbright, Boone County stormwater educator, said.

Salt Smart uses a variety of methods to prevent water contamination — studying how to keep roads safe while keeping streams safe as well, Woolbright said.

Salt, at higher levels, is toxic to fish and other freshwater animals and can harm pets and soil, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

“There is currently no practical way to remove salt from the environment,” Woolbright said. “Once the salt is in the environment, it doesn’t go away. It ends up in the local creeks, lakes and other water bodies.”

The chemical chloride in salt degrades the freshwater ecosystem. Systems like reverse osmosis can remove salt but are costly and used for drinking water, Woolbright said.

Salt Smart started in Wisconsin to combat salt contamination in local water sources, and it is a method now used across Columbia.

Travis Zimpfer, a University of Missouri spokesperson, said that collaboration with the city and other partners provided the university with guidelines to use salt effectively.

“There are guidelines that we want to follow to make sure that we’re able to properly utilize the product that we have and that we’re not over-salting in a way that is detrimental to the environment — and it’s about realizing that balance,” Zimpfer said.

Woolbright said there are other methods that can help with snow as well, such as shoveling, mixing beet juice with salt to create a salt brine or using a manufactured brine, which is a liquid meant to be sprayed onto pavement to melt ice.

Woolbright said salt still plays an important role in clearing roads. However, she said it’s about learning when and where to apply it.

“It’s not about completely writing salt off but using it appropriately,” Woolbright said.

The city of Columbia starts with 5,000 tons of salt for the winter season and used between 1,000 and 1,300 tons during the winter storm over the weekend, said Columbia Public Works spokesperson John Ogan.


Ogan said the city will have enough salt to last through the remainder of the winter season.

Ogan said he supports Salt Smart, but it is geared more toward individual salting practices at home and doesn’t affect city operations. The city of Columbia abides by the Missouri Department of Transportation’s guidelines on snow and ice control, Ogan said.

How to effectively use road salt to melt ice
Columbia’s Office of Sustainability offers a list of tips if people choose to use road salt.

The office recommends shoveling first — the more snow and ice you remove manually, the less salt you will have to use and the more effective it will be when you use it.

Most salts stop working at 15 degrees Fahrenheit. Use sand instead for traction, but remember that sand does not melt ice.

For best results, apply salt to cleared surfaces. The salt crystals should not overlap but be spread a few inches apart.

More salt does not mean more melting. One parking spot takes about a coffee cup full of salt or less. Use less than 4 pounds of salt per 1,000 square feet — an average parking spot is about 150 square feet. One pound of salt is about a heaping 12-ounce coffee mug.

Sweep up extra salt. If salt or sand is visible on dry pavement, it is not working and will be washed away into local streams through a storm drain or ditch system.

Even if an ice remover says it’s safe for pets, look at the ingredients. Calcium and magnesium chloride can burn their paws. Use a product with glycol or just use sand for traction. When you take your animals on a walk, cover their feet or wash them off after a walk.",3,1736614967.0,columbiamo,3,0.71,False

Lesson learned.  
  
But, folks in r/postprocessing really seem to understand what I am trying to do ... and so I had an epiphany over coffee: **why not have the AI make specific suggestions for post-processing ideas that could improve the photo?**   
  
And voila: [https://etpeterson.com/critique-post/](https://etpeterson.com/critique-post/)  
  
The app will still compare your images to others ([CritiqueFREE](https://etpeterson.com/critique/)), allow you to compare before and after photos you've already post-processed ([CritiqueCOMPARE](https://etpeterson.com/critique-compare/)), and see what other people are doing with their photos ([CritiqueVIEW](https://etpeterson.com/view-critiques/)) but I think you will like the new post-processing functionality.

While our walks the can walk normally and if we walk next to other dogs they look at them but not other reaction (normally). Also in a dog park they can play with other dogs and be totally friendly.
But if we’re seated in a park or drinking a coffee and another dog walk by they start barking at them and pulling the leash. 
We have tried controlling them in down position or distracting them with food but nothing seems to avoid this behavior and once one start barking this trigger the other one to de the same.

I had a date with someone I met on Hinge at a coffee shop. That date was probably the most awkward first date I’ve experienced in a while. I tried overlooking the fact that he ordered his coffee first and didn’t offer to pay for me. I even tried overlooking the fact that he said he’s not “made of money”. But when a man starts talking about duck dicks, you know it’s over. When will I find someone who doesn’t suck? 😭

So, here I am. I’ve decided to put Reddit to the test. I’ve even found a bunch of lovely men along the way, but I am not finding consistency. Are you struggling to find someone at your level? 

Just to prevent any surprises, please know that I am a divorced mother of one. I do not expect another man to be the father of my child, but I am looking for someone who wants to be my forever partner so that would mean being a part of the parenting team eventually. 

Please also be aware that I am taller for a female. (Almost 5’10” without shoes). I have an average/slender body type. Would love to find someone who inspires me to go to the gym—preferably together. I prefer men who take care of themselves.

Story: today, I did a lot of activities without any enjoyment. Even gaming felt dull. Tonight, I started overthinking: *Why and how can’t I feel enjoyment?* The answer was that I kept focusing on *fun* and *goals.* Once I let go of those two things and started enjoying the process, I felt joy in gaming again (like enjoying the gameplay), not the winning or goals.

I know this is about gaming, but I can’t wait to apply this 'enjoying the process' trick to other aspects tomorrow, other than entertainment ofc. Wish me luck, and I wish you luck too!

Try enjoying the process, eventually the goals will feel fun again (like winning in a game).

Hi all,

I'm looking for a child-safe foldaway rig that I can set up ""easily"". I'm looking at things like CoffeeRacer, but would be open to other options. I have a 9-month-old boy who is starting to crawl his way through our apartment. He hasn't made it as far as the office yet, where my GTOmega Apex is currently folded up, but I am worried that he soon will find the interest to do so. I plan to close the office door to keep him out, but time is working against me and that rig is not safe. Frankly, it weighs too much to hang on the wall and I don't have a closet or the space in current closets to store it there.

I'd appreciate some advice from people who have experience with foldaway setups. Let me know what your thoughts are and what options I might have.

Thanks,

Happy New Year!

I'm hoping to find my best friend and specially someone to connect with on multiple levels.

### Interests
- **Travel Enthusiast**: I have a deep love for travel and have been fortunate enough to do a bit. I can’t wait to go on my next adventure. Hopefully you’d be my travel partner.

- **Movie Buff**: Films are a window into other worlds and perspectives. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good movie and then discussing it in-depth with someone who shares the same passion.

- **Social Butterfly**: I believe that life is best lived in good company. Whether it's a casual coffee date or a relaxed evening, I'm always up for socializing and making new connections.

- **Food Explorer**: Trying new foods is one of my greatest joys. I have a curious palate and love trying new food. From street food vendors to fine dining restaurants, I enjoy the full spectrum of culinary experiences. 

- **Board Game Aficionado**: There's something magical about gathering around a table with friends or family for a board game night. I enjoy a wide variety of games, from strategic games to cooperative adventures. 

### What I’m Looking For
I'm searching for someone who I can go out on cute dates with and is ready to embark on new adventures together. A genuine, kind-hearted, and open-minded person who values honesty, trust, and communication. Someone who appreciates both the thrill of spontaneous adventures and well planned trips.

Life can be an incredible journey, and I'm eager to find a partner who I can enjoy life’s joys with. Let's create memories, discover new passions, and enjoy every moment together. ",1,1736613831.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

* [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

Quest Loud and Clear: after doing everything except burning the beehives (I’m using the Thieves Guild for good guys options) the quest won’t acknowledge anything and Brynholf doesn’t realize I’ve completed the task

Quest Honor Among Thieves : gotten to the part where I deliver a cure to Cairine in the Warrens - I go in to the Warrens with the cure to give it to her but she doesn’t give me the option

Restoring Order : cannot investigate the Solitude sewers because none of the sewer entrances give the option to go into them

Windhelm apothecary: every time I go inside, the door disappears and I cannot leave. All that there is is a large black space. This of course means there’s a few different quests I cannot complete. 

I’m sure there’s a few other things I’m not thinking of right now. I’ve tried to let the game rest for awhile and go do other quests to give it a chance to “catch up” but still no luck. I’ve reset everything, including clearing out ghost space. Any advice would be appreciated because I don’t want to get any further into my game and get more frustrated since I’m thinking I’m going to have to start over again.

1hyzqq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/priviatemusicteachers/comments/1hyzqq2/how_to_attract_new_students_as_a_private_music/,How to attract new students as a private music teacher,"Ever feel like your teaching skills are Grammy-worthy, but no one’s showing up to the concert? You’ve got the talent, the knowledge, and the patience of a saint (because, let’s face it, teaching *anyone* requires that), but somehow, your schedule is looking emptier than a Tuesday night open mic.

I’ve been there. You’ve printed the flyers, told everyone at the coffee shop about your lessons, and even tried convincing your cat to start piano just so you could have *one* steady student. And still, nothing. It's like you're the best-kept secret in town, but you don’t *want* to be a secret—you want to be the go-to private music teacher everyone’s buzzing about.

So, what gives? Why does it sometimes feel harder to find students than to play a flawless Bach fugue? The good news is: it’s not just you. Attracting new students can feel like trying to tune a guitar with one broken string—it’s tricky, but totally doable if you know where to start.

Let’s talk about how you can fill your calendar, build a reputation, and get those students lining up to learn from the rockstar (or virtuoso) you truly are. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t involve begging your relatives to take lessons. (Unless they’re genuinely interested—then, hey, no shame.)

Ready? Let’s dive in! 🎶

**Step 1: Define Your Audience**

Here’s the thing: not all students are created equal. That’s not a bad thing—it’s just a fact. An eager 7-year-old, a stressed-out teenager prepping for auditions, and a 35-year-old accountant with dreams of shredding like Slash all have *very* different needs. (Spoiler alert: they also have very different energy levels.)

Knowing your ideal student is like knowing the genre you want to play—if you’re a jazz musician at heart, you’re not going to thrive in a death metal band. The same goes for teaching. Do you light up when working with total beginners? Are you passionate about advanced technique? Or do you love the challenge of helping adults rediscover the joy of music?

Here’s why this matters:

1. **Your Teaching Style Will Shine** Every teacher has a sweet spot. Maybe you’re incredible at breaking down complex theory for beginners, or you know exactly how to motivate a burnt-out teenager. By focusing on the type of student you *really* click with, you’ll be happier—and your students will learn better.
2. **Your Marketing Will Be On Point** Once you know your ideal student, it’s easier to find them. You can tailor your social media posts, flyers, or word-of-mouth pitches to exactly who you’re trying to attract. For example, “Learn piano basics for kids!” is a lot more specific (and effective) than “Piano lessons for everyone!”
3. **Your Students Will Stay Longer** When you’re working with the right fit, it’s magic. They’ll feel like you *get* them, and they’re more likely to stick around, recommend you to friends, and actually practice.

Here’s a fun way to think about it: Teaching an eager 7-year-old is a little different than helping a busy parent unlock their inner rock star. One might need stickers and a LOT of high-fives. The other might just need 30 minutes of peace, a simple riff to practice, and a strong cup of coffee.

So, ask yourself: Who is your ideal student? Is it the kid who can’t sit still but loves banging on the drums? The teen who’s desperate to ace their next recital? The adult who’s finally living their dream of playing “Wonderwall” at family gatherings?

Define your audience, and you’ll take the first step toward building a studio that works *for you*. Because the right students aren’t just a joy to teach—they’re the ones who remind you why you fell in love with music in the first place. 

# Step 2: Spruce Up Your Online Presence

Let’s face it: in today’s world, if you’re not online, you might as well be teaching music lessons from a cave. Don’t worry, though—you don’t need to have a flashy, influencer-style presence or spend hours perfecting viral dance moves (unless you want to, of course). What you *do* need is an online space that screams, “I’m awesome at what I do, and you’d love to learn from me!”

# Start with the Basics: A Friendly, Professional Website

Think of your website as your virtual business card—but cooler. It doesn’t have to be fancy; it just needs to work. Here’s what it should include:

* **Your Bio**: Tell people who you are, what you teach, and why you’re passionate about music. Keep it warm and relatable—no one wants to read a dry resume.
* **Your Services**: Be clear about what you offer. Piano lessons for beginners? Advanced guitar coaching? Ukulele jam sessions? Spell it out.
* **Contact Info**: Make it easy for people to reach you. Add an email form or a simple “Book a Lesson” button.
* **Testimonials**: Got happy students? Ask them for a quick quote about how much they love your lessons and showcase it. Bonus points if you can include pictures or videos of them rocking out.

# Social Media: Your Secret Weapon

Now, let’s talk social media. You don’t have to be a full-blown content creator, but having a presence on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube can make a HUGE difference. Here’s how to use them without feeling overwhelmed:

* **Show Off Your Skills**: Post short clips of you playing your instrument, demonstrating techniques, or jamming out to popular songs. Remember, a quick video of you nailing that guitar solo? Gold.
* **Teach Something Simple**: Share a tip, riff, or chord progression. This shows you’re not only talented but also approachable and generous with your knowledge.
* **Get Creative**: If you’re on TikTok, join a music-related trend or duet someone’s video. On Instagram, share a “behind-the-scenes” post of your lesson setup. Keep it fun and authentic!
* **Engage**: Follow local musicians, like and comment on their posts, and connect with potential students in your area.

# Why This Works

People love working with someone they feel connected to, and social media is your chance to show off your personality. It’s not just about what you teach—it’s about who you are. Are you the super-patient teacher who makes music fun? The passionate player who inspires others? Let that shine.

And no, you don’t have to post every day. Just aim for consistency—once or twice a week is plenty. Think of it as a way to invite people into your world and show them what they’re missing out on if they don’t book a lesson with you.

So, get your website up and running, start sprinkling a little of your magic on social media, and let the world know that you’re open for business. Soon, you’ll have students sliding into your DMs faster than you can say, “Here’s a G chord.”

**Step 3: Tap into Local Networks**

Let’s take a break from the digital world and focus on something old-school: connecting with your local community. Yes, *actual humans in your area.* It might sound simple, but tapping into local networks can be a game-changer for growing your student base. And trust me, there’s a whole group of aspiring musicians out there who need a guide—you. Be their Obi-Wan.

# Start with Schools

Schools are a goldmine for finding potential students, especially if you specialize in teaching kids or teens. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Reach Out to Music Teachers**: Local schools often have music programs, and their teachers are always looking for resources to help their students improve. Introduce yourself and offer to be a referral for private lessons. Bring cookies. (Okay, cookies are optional, but who doesn’t like cookies?)
2. **Offer Workshops or Clinics**: Propose running a free or low-cost workshop on a specific skill—like mastering tricky scales, audition prep, or even songwriting. It’s a great way to show your expertise and get your name out there.
3. **Band Programs**: School bands are full of students who could use extra help. Talk to the band director about offering one-on-one lessons or small group sessions.

# Partner with Music Stores

Every town has that music store where musicians gather to drool over shiny instruments and stock up on gear. This is your hub!

1. **Build Relationships with Staff**: Chat with the employees and let them know you’re a private teacher. If they like you, they’ll often recommend you to customers who are looking for lessons.
2. **Leave Your Info**: Create eye-catching business cards or flyers and leave them at the store. Bonus points if you include a QR code linking to your website or social media.
3. **Host Events**: Partner with the store for events like demo days or “meet the teacher” nights. People love free events—and they’ll remember you when they’re ready to sign up for lessons.

# Get Involved in Community Centers

Community centers, libraries, and local event spaces often host classes, workshops, or clubs. Why not join in?

1. **Teach a Group Class**: Offer a beginner’s class in guitar, piano, or even ukulele. Group lessons are a low-pressure way for people to test the waters, and you can always pitch private lessons to anyone who’s interested.
2. **Volunteer at Events**: Show your face at local music-related events, like open mics or talent shows. Volunteering to judge or emcee gets you noticed, and people will start associating your name with music.
3. **Network with Parents**: Community centers are teeming with parents looking for enriching activities for their kids. Be the person they think of when they hear “music lessons.”

# Don’t Forget About Local Bands

Have you noticed a trend here? Your local music scene is brimming with untapped opportunities. Go to gigs, introduce yourself to the musicians, and let them know you teach. Not only could they send students your way, but you might also find chances to collaborate, jam, or even learn something new yourself.

# Why This Works

People are more likely to trust someone they’ve met in person. When you’re out there connecting with schools, music stores, and community centers, you’re doing more than marketing—you’re building relationships. And relationships lead to referrals, which lead to students.

Remember, the local band kids *need* you. Be their Obi-Wan, their Yoda, their Mr. Miyagi of music. With a little effort and a lot of heart, you’ll become the go-to teacher everyone’s talking about—and not just because you brought cookies.

**Step 4: Offer a Taster Session**

Here’s a universal truth: people love free stuff almost as much as they love a good riff. Offering a free or discounted introductory lesson is like handing out samples at a music buffet—it lets potential students “taste” what it’s like to learn from you without committing to the whole meal just yet. And if you wow them in that first session, they’ll be back for seconds (and thirds).

# Why Taster Sessions Work

1. **They Lower the Barrier to Entry** Some people hesitate to sign up for lessons because they’re unsure if they’ll enjoy it, if they’ll vibe with you as a teacher, or even if they’ll be any good at the instrument. A taster session takes away the risk. It says, “Hey, no pressure—come hang out, try it out, and see if you like it.”
2. **They Let You Show Off Your Skills** A taster session is your chance to shine. It’s where you can show potential students just how fun and engaging you are as a teacher. Maybe you’ve got a knack for explaining tricky concepts, or your humor puts people at ease. This is your audition, so make it count.
3. **They Build Trust** When someone experiences your teaching style firsthand, they’re more likely to trust you with their musical journey. Plus, it’s easier for them to picture themselves committing to lessons when they’ve already dipped their toes in the water.

# How to Offer a Taster Session

1. **Decide on the Format** Keep it short and sweet—30 minutes is usually plenty for an introductory lesson. Use this time to:
   * Get to know the student (their goals, experience, and favorite music).
   * Teach them something simple but satisfying, like a basic chord, riff, or rhythm pattern.
   * Leave them with one small “homework” item, like practicing a simple exercise, so they feel accomplished.
2. **Set the Terms** Will the session be completely free, or will it be discounted? Either option works, but if you’re offering a discount, make it appealing—like 50% off their first lesson. If free feels too generous, you could also bundle it: “Book 3 lessons, and your first one is free!”
3. **Promote It** Shout it from the rooftops (or, you know, your website and social media). Create a clear and enticing message, like:“Curious about music lessons? Your first session is on the house! Come see what it’s like to learn guitar, piano, or \[insert your instrument\] with me—no strings attached (well, except for guitar strings).”
4. **Deliver the Goods** When the student shows up, make them feel welcome and excited. Ask them about their musical interests, sprinkle in a little humor, and keep the session light and encouraging. Even if they’re starting from scratch, help them walk away feeling like they’ve achieved something.

# Bonus Tip: Follow Up

After the taster session, send a friendly follow-up message. Thank them for coming, highlight something they did well, and invite them to book more lessons. Something like:

>

# Why It’s Worth It

Yes, offering free or discounted sessions means giving up a little time or money upfront, but the payoff can be huge. Once people experience how much fun they can have learning with you, they’ll be way more likely to sign up for regular lessons. And who knows? They might even bring a friend (or five) along for the ride.

Remember, people love free stuff—but what they love even more is discovering something amazing they didn’t expect. Be that amazing thing. 

**Step 5: Word of Mouth is Still King**

Let’s be real: in the world of private music teaching, nothing beats word of mouth. It’s like the backstage pass of marketing—it gets you in doors that ads and flyers just can’t. People trust recommendations from friends, family, and even random internet strangers over anything else. So, why not turn your happy students into your personal hype squad?

# Why Word of Mouth Works

When someone gushes about how awesome their music teacher is, it’s authentic. It’s real. It’s basically free marketing, and it comes with a side of social proof. Think about it: if your friend tells you their guitar teacher is “an absolute legend” who helped them learn their favorite song in a week, you’re way more likely to give that teacher a call.

The good news? Happy students are usually more than willing to spread the word—you just need to give them a little nudge.

# How to Get Glowing Testimonials

1. **Ask for Feedback** Don’t be shy! At the end of a lesson or after a few months of working together, ask your students (or their parents, if they’re kids) how they feel about the lessons. If they’re excited about their progress, ask if they’d be willing to write a quick testimonial. Most people are happy to help, especially if you make it easy for them.
   * Example:“Hey \[Name\], I’m so glad you’ve been enjoying lessons! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? It would really help me connect with more students like you.”
2. **Keep It Simple** Not everyone loves writing, so make the process painless. Provide a few prompts like:
   * “What was your favorite part about learning with me?”
   * “What’s something you’ve accomplished since starting lessons?”
   * “Would you recommend me to others? Why?”
3. **Share the Love** Once you have testimonials, put them to good use! Add them to your website, post them on social media, and even include them in emails to potential students. A testimonial from a real person is worth a thousand self-promotion posts.

# How to Encourage Referrals

1. **Incentivize It** Sweeten the deal by offering a small reward for referrals. For example:
   * “Refer a friend, and you both get 10% off your next lesson!”
   * “Bring in a new student, and I’ll give you a free lesson as a thank-you!” People love perks, and a little incentive can go a long way.
2. **Plant the Seed** Sometimes, all it takes is a friendly reminder. Mention that you’re open to referrals and that you’d love to teach more awesome people like them. Something casual like:“If you know anyone who’s been thinking about music lessons, feel free to send them my way—I’d love to help!”
3. **Create a Sense of Community** If your students feel like they’re part of something special, they’re more likely to spread the word. Host a recital, create a social media group for your students, or send out a newsletter with tips and shoutouts. When your students feel connected to you and your teaching, they’ll naturally want to share the experience with others.

# Why This Works

Referrals and testimonials don’t just bring in new students—they bring in the *right* students. The people who come to you through word of mouth are often already sold on your teaching style because someone they trust vouched for you. And let’s be honest, nothing feels better than a new student saying, “I heard you’re the best!”

So, think of your happy students as your personal hype squad. Keep them excited, encourage them to share their experiences, and watch your schedule fill up faster than a sold-out concert.

**Step 6: Optimize Scheduling and Pricing**

Ah, scheduling and pricing—the two unglamorous but absolutely crucial pillars of running your teaching business. If these aren’t nailed down, even the most enthusiastic students might think twice about signing up. But don’t worry, this isn’t rocket science. It’s more like finding the right rhythm for a good groove—get it right, and everything flows.

# The Art of Scheduling

Let’s start with the big one: when do you teach? Because no one—and I mean *no one*—wants a music lesson at 7 AM unless they’re Mozart reincarnated. And even then, they’d probably want coffee first.

1. **Set Reasonable Hours** Decide on a teaching schedule that works for *you* and your potential students. If you teach kids, afternoons and early evenings are gold. For adults, you might need to offer evening or weekend slots. Just don’t burn yourself out trying to accommodate everyone—your time matters too!
2. **Offer Some Flexibility** Life happens, and sometimes students need to reschedule. Build a little wiggle room into your calendar, but set boundaries to protect your sanity. For example:
   * Allow rescheduling with 24-hour notice.
   * Offer a makeup lesson policy for missed sessions.
   * Consider virtual lessons as a backup option for busy schedules or bad weather.
3. **Use Scheduling Tools** If back-and-forth emails about availability are eating your time, invest in a simple scheduling app like Calendly or Acuity. These tools let students book available slots, saving everyone a headache.

# Pricing: Be Clear, Be Fair

Pricing can feel tricky, but here’s the golden rule: be upfront, fair, and confident in what you’re worth. You’re offering a valuable skill, so don’t undersell yourself!

1. **Research the Local Market** Check what other private music teachers in your area charge. Pricing yourself way below the average might attract students, but it can also undervalue your expertise. Find a sweet spot that’s competitive but reflects your skills and experience.
2. **Simplify Your Rates** Keep your pricing structure straightforward to avoid confusion. For example:
   * $X for 30-minute lessons.
   * $Y for 60-minute lessons.
   * Discounts for bulk packages (e.g., 10 lessons for the price of 9). Complicated pricing = hesitant students. Simple pricing = easy decisions.
3. **Be Transparent** Spell out what’s included in your lessons (materials, practice resources, etc.) and any additional costs (e.g., books or instruments). The more upfront you are, the more trust you’ll build with potential students.
4. **Consider Tiered Options** Not every student has the same budget, and that’s okay! Offering a couple of pricing tiers can make lessons accessible without devaluing your time. For example:
   * Standard lessons: Weekly one-on-one sessions.
   * Premium option: Includes extra practice check-ins or personalized video feedback between lessons.

# Communicating Scheduling & Pricing

Once you’ve nailed down your schedule and pricing, make sure it’s super clear to your students. Post it on your website, include it in your welcome emails, and don’t hesitate to mention it during taster sessions. Transparency here builds trust—and avoids awkward money conversations later.

Here’s a way to phrase it:

>

# Why This Matters

Clear, fair pricing and flexible scheduling aren’t just about logistics—they’re about building a professional and student-friendly experience. When your students know what to expect, they feel more comfortable committing. And when your schedule works for them *and* for you, teaching becomes a lot more enjoyable.

So, skip the 7 AM lesson slots (unless you’re teaching a time-traveling Mozart), make your policies simple and student-friendly, and watch how much easier it becomes to grow your studio.

**Step 7: The Power of Patience and Persistence**

Let’s get real for a minute: building a thriving music studio takes time. Some weeks, your calendar will feel like it’s bursting at the seams, and other weeks, you might find yourself twiddling your thumbs and wondering if your students have all joined a rock band without you. (Spoiler alert: they haven’t. Probably.)

Here’s the thing: *Rome wasn’t built in a day—and neither was a thriving studio.* The road to success as a private music teacher isn’t a straight shot. It’s more like learning a tricky piece of music. You’ll hit some sour notes, but with patience and persistence, you’ll eventually nail it.

# Why Slow Periods Happen

Every business has ups and downs, and teaching is no exception. Slow periods don’t mean you’re failing—they’re just part of the process. Maybe it’s summer break and everyone’s at the beach, or it’s exam season and students are swamped. Whatever the reason, these lulls are normal.

The key is to keep going, even when things feel slow. Because let’s face it, Beethoven didn’t write symphonies by giving up halfway through the second movement.

# How to Stay Motivated During Slow Periods

1. **Focus on the Long Game** Remember, building a studio takes time. Even the most successful teachers started with just a handful of students. Celebrate small wins—like your first referral or a student mastering their first song. These moments add up!
2. **Use the Downtime Wisely** Slow periods can feel frustrating, but they’re also a chance to regroup and recharge. Use this time to:
   * Update your website or create fresh content for social media.
   * Plan new lesson materials or experiment with teaching techniques.
   * Take a deep dive into your own music practice. After all, great teachers are lifelong learners.
3. **Keep Putting Yourself Out There** It’s tempting to take a break from promoting yourself when things are quiet, but this is exactly when you should double down. Post that guitar riff on Instagram. Reach out to local schools again. Attend a community event. The more consistent you are, the more momentum you’ll build.
4. **Stay Connected** Reach out to your current students during breaks or lulls. A quick check-in—like sharing a practice tip or sending a “how’s it going?” message—keeps you on their radar and shows you care.

# The Power of Persistence

Every successful teacher has a story about the tough times. The early mornings spent building a website, the slow months when they worried no one would show up, the years it took to fill their schedule. The common thread? They didn’t quit.

Patience and persistence aren’t just nice ideas—they’re your secret weapons. Each small effort you make today will pay off in the long run, whether it’s gaining a new student, getting a referral, or building your reputation as the go-to teacher in your area.

# Why This Matters

Building a studio isn’t just about filling your schedule—it’s about creating a business that grows with you. Success in teaching comes from the connections you make, the effort you put in, and the passion you bring to every lesson. And that doesn’t happen overnight.

So, when the slow periods hit (and they will), don’t let them discourage you. Use them to fuel your creativity, hone your craft, and remind yourself why you started teaching in the first place. Because one day, when your schedule is jam-packed and you’ve got a waiting list a mile long, you’ll look back and realize: every single step was worth it.

Stay the course. Rome wasn’t built in a day—and neither is a great studio. But with patience and persistence, yours will be *legendary.*

Here’s the thing: attracting students as a private music teacher is a mix of effort, creativity, and—yes—a little patience. Some strategies might click immediately, while others might take time to bear fruit. But if you stay true to your passion for music and keep experimenting, those students will come.

Think about it like this: remember when you first picked up your instrument? You probably weren’t shredding solos or playing flawless scales on day one. It took practice, persistence, and a whole lot of experimenting. Building your teaching studio is the same way. Progress might be slow at first, but every step you take moves you closer to your goals.

# An Inspiring Note

I once heard about a teacher who started with just one student—a neighbor kid learning piano. That teacher didn’t have a fancy studio or a huge social media following, but they had heart. They gave that one student their all, and soon, that student told a friend, who told another friend, and before long, the teacher’s calendar was packed. They didn’t just build a studio—they built a *community.*

The moral of the story? Even the smallest beginnings can lead to big results if you’re willing to put in the work.

# Your Call to Action

So, what’s your next step? Whether it’s revamping your website, reaching out to local schools, or simply posting a quick riff on Instagram, take one small action today to move your teaching business forward. You’ve got the skills, the passion, and the drive to make it happen.

And remember: keep it fun, keep it real, and keep playing. Because when you love what you do, that enthusiasm becomes contagious—and the students will follow.",1,1736613389.0,priviatemusicteachers,1,1.0,False

1hyzo3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hyzo3m/seeking_serious_advice_at_a_crucial_point_in_my/,Seeking serious advice at a crucial point in my life.,"Hello all,

Last week, I left the furniture business (two stores and e-commerce) that my father and I started eight years ago. The primary reason was the significant strain it placed on our father-son relationship. Currently, I am jobless, and while I know this may seem foolish, I had to step away for the sake of my health. I’ll add that I had very valid reasons for leaving.

Before this, I (36/m) worked as an exempt mid-to-upper-level manager at Target, where I held various leadership roles for 18–30 months each. These roles spanned Food, Logistics, HR, and Guest Experience, and the diversity of my responsibilities made it an outstanding and enriching experience.

As a small business owner, I learned how to do just about everything: sales (something I’ve done my whole life), procurement/buying, digital marketing, entry-level web management, social media management, SEO, and traditional marketing. However, I was working 5–7 days a week and putting in grueling hours. I don’t think I ever fully recovered from the toll of COVID on the business and myself.

Because of the diversity of my career experiences, I feel like a jack-of-all-trades, which is making it difficult to figure out my next path. I feel strongly inclined toward a sales role, as I’m confident I would thrive in that area. I can't say that I have much of a calling. Eventually, I'd like to go back to school, get a masters, and become a licensed therapist and own a private practice, but that is no less than a 4-5 year endeavor. Financially, I can't swing it right now. 

I was a small business owner for eight years, which is a unique experience. Since leaving, I’ve been applying for jobs, polishing my resume and LinkedIn profile, reaching out to old networking connections, and setting up coffee chats with peers—essentially, doing everything I can to create opportunities.

Despite my efforts, I feel incredibly overwhelmed and stressed. Financially, I can manage for a few months, but I cannot collect unemployment because I quit. My father, knowing the toll the business took on me, refused to fire me, leaving me without that safety net. The financial stress, combined with the uncertainty of my next step, is intense and not the kind of stress that motivates.

Here’s where I am in life (allow me for a paragraph to self-loathe): I’m single, have no kids, and feel financially behind. For the past eight years, I had no employer-provided benefits, insurance, or retirement contributions. I paid out-of-pocket for health insurance through the state and contributed to a Roth IRA on my own. Now, I’m looking at re-signing a 12-month lease to continue living in a house with three other people - a situation that negatively affects my mental health, dating life, and overall ability to find space and time for myself. Having been so immersed and consumed with the business, I wasn't able to attend local chamber meetings, to network too much, and so my personal network is small. So many of the reps I worked with at my business have been fired and or left the industry all together. While we did have good relationships, they were never super strong (they had tons and tons of accounts). I feel pretty lonely right now and I feel like I don't have many resources to reach out and speak to, thus I am here. 

I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I worry that I’ll rush into the first job that offers me something, potentially landing in a role I’ll regret later, solely so I don't fall into bankruptcy. Like I said, I believe I’d excel in sales, but I’m struggling to gain traction and have been rejected from every job I’ve applied for so far. Crafting a strong resume that narrows my focus while showcasing my diverse background has been a challenge. 

What I’m doing right:

* Eating well.
* Going to the gym 3–4 days a week.
* Spending time outside, even in this cold and overcast weather.
* Avoiding alcohol and any substances (aside from the occasional edible after completing my tasks).
* Focusing on improving my resume, LinkedIn profile, and networking efforts.
* Managing my finances carefully.
* Making time to meet with friends and maintain a social life to avoid isolation.
* Seeing my therapist every two weeks.
* Reading books and trying to take in new information and perspectives.

I know I’m capable, very much so, and that I can bring immense value to a business. But right now, I feel overwhelmed and lost in this transition from small business ownership to a W2 role. My father, who was once my mentor, became my business partner, and our relationship has grown cold. I gave eight of the best years of my life to our business, and now I feel financially and emotionally behind. I do feel pressured to to make sure my next move is the right one. After all, I'm 36 and I want to find a wife and have kids, I don't want to age out of the kid thing. I’m struggling to find my way forward. I'm not defeated, but this sail boat is spinning in all directions trying to catch any wind it can.",1,1736613202.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1hyzo09,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hyzo09/decaf_coffee/,Decaf Coffee,"This question probably popped up more than once. If I aim at caffeine-free, would decaf be okay to drink? 

The reason I am asking: I used to drink one large coffee Turkish Style with tons of caffeine in the morning. And then normally I would not drink anything with caffeine as I wouldn’t be able to sleep. But I found instant decaf coffee soothing for my nerves and drank it after work without restriction. I did not have to had it, so some days I would not drink it, but others I could drink up to 4 cups. I like hot drink. 

I guess if I am even asking this question, the answer is no. Decaf to be avoided.

I kindly explained how the site worked. we continued chatting for a couple of weeks. it was very friendly, and I didn't think much about it. he was the one doing the contact. I just responded when I had time. we seemed to hit it off. he was smart. seemed educated and his photo showed quite an elegant person. he claimed to work for DOD on classified projects. RED FLAG #1

we ended up communicating on signal. had several phone calls his accent fitted his claim to be from a Scandinavian country. after a few weeks I suggested we meet for coffee. we lived an hour drive from each other, so I'd been led to believe. but he said he needed to travel to another state to set up a project, classified of course. things were going well and then he claimed to love me!!! BIG RED FLAG GOES UP! he became very emotionally direct. miss you. can't wait to spend my life with you. we even planned the house we would buy.

I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop: needs money for airfare to visit sick child or to escape some awful situation. but it never happened. he had said he was divorced. as things progressed and I couldn't see that shoe I was expecting to drop. I started thinking maybe I'd met the man of my dreams.

he attempted a video call that lasted all but a fraction of a second as he dropped his phone. ( which I discovered later to be a ploy of scammers) throughout I was considerate, friendly, kind and concerned for him. this is now two months into the contact. I started considering him a friend. I wasn't interested in being coupled but if it happens great. it seemed fine to have a supported kind text friend, then he was contracted to go to middle east (ME) to set up a project. I thought this was strange as the war is going on. RED FLAG #3.

he arrives in said ME country and within a few days calls to tell me he's having trouble getting into his bank to transfer monies to pay for equipment. he's trying to figure what to do. I suggest obvious: call the company who sent you. he can't do that. instead after a day or two he asks if I can help him?? can I see if I can access the website for his bank and see if I can figure why he can't. I know stupid of me I had 3 red flags. but he seemed a wonderful caring man. LOL this is RD FLAG #4

I went to website while he was on phone with me. I chatted with customer service, who I believe was him, and asked why he couldn't get into his account. they don't do business in ME! even though they are an offshore bank. he seemed concerned and said, ""let me think about what else he can do. if he can't come up with something i'll give you (me) my log info and maybe you can transfer for me""!! BIG BIG RED FLAG #5

fortunately, his hanging up to think what to do, gave me time to investigate. I discovered STARLINK, who he claimed to be contracted to, did not get gov agreement to operate in this ME country. also the banking institution he was trying to access was considered fraudulent, is not registered with the SEC and was only set up two months ago. coincidence! I take a deep breath and contact FBI giving them the info I had. lost count of RED FLAGS by now.

I lay in bed disappointed about what could have been. pulled myself out of the dream and realized how lucky I was to be aware and suspicious from the start and very, very fortunate that I won't lose my money...just the love of my life..lol

the scammers get you to lock into their banking making it seem that it's safe after all it's not my bank or my money but what you don't realize is the website they create has other entities that swoop in and take your info and get access to your banking!! I never understood how people could lose all their money without sending or writing a cheque. now I know.

I'm writing this as a warning in the hope it prevents someone from being taken advantage of. don't do anything for anyone you don't really know.

I text the guy to say, I didn't feel comfortable doing the transaction. I did it in a nonconfrontational way so as to not upset him. but he seemed annoyed and the more he talked his accent changed. not sure if it was the same person or they work in a group.

oh, the camera. I asked several times for him to send me pics if his locations. I wanted evidence. he said: ""don't you remember babe I dropped my phone and it damaged the camera?"" lol

you may wonder why I continued texting with him for so long, I had just ended a relationship, and I guess the scammer was a distraction, he was smooth, knew all the right things to say and as I said intelligent and handsome. how could someone like this be using me?? also as it was slow progressing, I was confused as to whether he was playing with me. and his supposed job made sense as to why we couldn't meet. I kept my wits about me and didn't fall for his nonsense.

I hope I help someone. be vigilant check out institution there are sights to check for you, scamadvisor is one.

I received a Pop+ for Christmas so I’m really looking forward to trying different things. Previously, I was given a pixie and used it for a few years but never really looked into different pods. I also didn’t take care of it since it was in bad shape when it was given to me but I never had any issues with it. For this I used the blonde Starbucks ones from the grocery store. 

I have a milk frother and typically like my coffee with a lot of milk. I like sweet coffee drinks too. 

Out of the sample pack that came with the pop+, 
the double espresso dolce stood out to me and I really liked it. I like the Bianco doppio as well but with the amount of milk I use, I find it drowns out the coffee taste. I think the dolce had a stronger flavour. Of the coffee samples I liked the melozio.

I have been dealing with gut issues for about 5 years. I got a bunch of tests done and all I'm told is that I have a bunch of inflammation in my gut. I've been healthy my whole life. My problem is extreme constipation. I don't go at all.

I believe my whole system is stressed out due to my lifestyle. 

I used to drink really hard for years. Also heavily addicted to caffeine which is harder to kick. I've been sober for about a month. And I cut down my daily average of caffeine from maybe 600mg to 200mg right now.  I would drink high stim preworkout, coffee, and an energy drink. So it would go well over 600 on some days. I did this for a couple years probably.

I also have been working rotating shift for the past 3 years.  I switched between days and nights. So of course I would pound caffeine on days and nights to survive. I just recently quit that job and will be starting an only day shift job in 2 weeks. These issues did start before this job, but I'm pretty positive it made things so much worse.

I eat low carb. Sugar and carbs seems to make things worse. I drink about a half gallon of water. Like I said, I've been sober for about a month. But am heavily addicted to caffeine, so trying to quit. I  don't smoke. I don't drink pop. I'm a gym rat, lift 5 days a week and get 12k steps a day .

Any advice would be appreciated. My body hurts everyday, im miserable and I never get sleep. I just want to feel healthy again.",1,1736612491.0,Biohackers,7,1.0,False

I’ve always had a hard time. I feel like my parents could have been more involved with my upbringing however that’s neither here nor there.

I feel like I’ve done everything right. I got my degree, finally got the job. Live in New York City now because of work. One thing leads to another I guess.

All my ex girlfriends have cheated on me or worse.

My most recent ex was extremely abusive, poured drinks on me, hit me, pulled a knife, told me she’d fuck someone in my apartment while I was out of town at my first real job. Came over to my apartment at 3am when I tried to break up with her and held down the horn waking up my neighbors, I told her I didn’t want her inside and she could sleep in her car & she threatened to call the cops and accuse me of rape. She came inside & proceeded to destroy my belongings.. tv, guitar, coffee table, dishes. If it was liftable then she threw it.

I have a hard time now with self worth & getting to know people. I’ve been trying to find a healthy partner to be with but I may as well be invisible.

On paper my life is fine but I’m absolutely spiraling out of control. I drink to numb the pain which either gets me to bed early or leads to a depressive break down. My family worries about me & to not drag them into it I try to stay emotionally distant.

I feel like I’m extremely outgoing & im social & want to make friends and meet new people but I fear I’m so damaged that it’s palpable.

I just don’t know how to continue. My passions don’t bring me joy anymore, I cant play guitar the way I used too because of a degenerative joint condition, and while it doesn’t 100% impair my playing, it’s certainly noticeable.

Anyways I feel like just void of happiness & I’ve become less and less of myself and more of this shitty unhappy unfulfilled version of this guy who used to be so full of light & love.

Do you guys have any advice? I’m actively trying to get over my alcoholism…",5,1736612320.0,GuyCry,5,0.86,False

1hyzatt,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1hyzatt/severe_selective_social_anxiety_anyone/,"Severe SELECTIVE social anxiety, anyone? ","Hi everyone. I have found little to no revealing-enough content on this topic online, so I thought of starting the conversation myself. I have been dealing with social anxiety my whole life, but here's the really weird part. With certain people - even in romantic contexts it has been crippling, to the point of it being humiliating, while with others I seem the most normal person, head on their shoulders, charming and smart. Same goes at work - I have contexts where I can barely speak and I'm visibly nervous and shy, to the point where my lips tremble and my breath is stuck, and others where I'm being not just fluent, but smart and convincing. I have trouble entering coffee shops at times, and feel at home in others. Probably the most important part of it all - the shameful moments, those filled with negative thoughts (that I am being judged, etc.), have lead my life in the most destructive places and with the most toxic people I could have imagined. Always a sense of lack of self-worth, like I'm a freak. Somehow this part-time severe anxiety is even worse than having it always, as I get glimpses of what my life could have looked like had I been normal. I have been doing therapy for almost 7 years now and though it has helped in certain aspects (related to shame and self-acceptance), it hasn't helped with others - and this social anxiety - still selective, still weirdly showing up, is now stronger than ever. I am 37. I recently suffered from a minor stroke (ischemic) and I'm so afraid this might also be related to this whole anxiety that has been building up for so long. I don't know anyone like me and I thought I'd at least give this thread a shot and see if what I'm feeling and what has been going on in my life for so long feels any way familiar to other people.",2,1736612219.0,socialanxiety,1,1.0,False

1hyz8gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fat2Fit/comments/1hyz8gx/coffee_myths_that_kept_me_from_losing_weight_for/,Coffee myths that kept me from losing weight for years,"I see people drinking coffee every day and wonder if it's helping them lose weight or making them gain more. Sometimes my friends tell me coffee is super bad for losing pounds, but others say it's good - who should I believe? In this article, you'll discover why 78% of dieters get coffee all wrong in their weight loss journey.

When I'm trying to shed some weight, the last thing I want is my morning cup of joe working against me! Studies show that black coffee might boost your metabolism, which gets me excited about my daily routine. You gonna be surprised to learn that the time of day you drink coffee matters way more than most people think.

The truth bout artificial sweeteners in coffee shocked me when I learned it - they might be tricking your body in ways you didn't expect. My nutritionist told me something interesting: it's not the coffee that's the problem, it's what we put in it that could be sabotaging our weight loss goals.

# The Potential Benefits of Coffee for Weight Loss

**Metabolic boost** changes everything about weight loss. I learned this while studying nutrition science. Coffee makes the body burn calories faster. My research shows drinking black coffee increases metabolism by 3-11% for three hours.

Sometimes I drink coffee before exercising. The **caffeine boost** helps me work out longer. Last week, I ran an extra mile after my morning cup. This happens because coffee helps burn fat during workouts.

Coffee BenefitImpact on Weight LossDurationMetabolism Boost3-11% increase3 hoursExercise Enhancement12% longer workouts1-2 hoursAppetite Control10-20% reduction2-4 hours

The **natural appetite suppressant** effects amaze me. My hunger usually decreases after drinking coffee. This helps avoid snacking between meals. *Coffee contains chlorogenic acid* that slows down glucose release into the bloodstream.

I notice better focus during morning workouts with coffee. The **enhanced athletic performance** comes from caffeine-blocking adenosine. This makes exercise feel easier. Coffee before gym time works great for weight training too.

# The Potential Drawbacks of Coffee for Weight Loss

**Hidden calories** sneak into coffee drinks easily. I watch people at cafes order fancy beverages loaded with sugar. My local coffee shop's mocha drink contains 420 calories. That equals a whole meal.

Sleep problems hit me when drinking coffee late. The **caffeine disruption** keeps me awake past midnight sometimes. Poor sleep makes weight loss harder. My body holds onto fat when tired. Cortisol levels rise too.

Impact AreaEffectDurationSleep Quality50% reduction6-8 hoursCortisol Spike30% increase4-5 hoursDehydration Risk2-3% fluid loss2-4 hours

The **stress hormone** connection worries me. Coffee increases cortisol production. High cortisol leads to belly fat storage. My research shows this effect is stronger in stressed people.

I learned about **water balance** issues too. Coffee makes me visit the bathroom more often. Many mistake this fluid loss for real weight loss. The **diuretic effect** can cause dehydration without careful water intake.

# How to Drink Coffee for Weight Loss

Black coffee works best for weight goals. Every morning, I skip cream and sugar. This saves 100-200 calories per cup. The pure coffee taste grows on you quickly.

Timing matters a lot. I drink my last coffee before 2 PM. This helps avoid sleep problems. Morning coffee gives the best metabolism boost. Afternoon drinks can interfere with natural energy cycles.

Natural sweeteners help transition away from sugar. I tried stevia and monk fruit. They taste good without adding calories. Unsweetened almond milk adds only 30 calories per cup.

The coffee amount needs personal adjustment. Some people handle three cups fine. Others get jittery after one. I track my responses in a diary. This helps find the right balance.

Coffee temperature affects benefits too. Hot coffee provides more antioxidants than cold brew. But cold brew causes less acid reflux. Both work for weight loss when drunk black.

# Monitoring Your Coffee Consumption

**Daily tracking** helps understand coffee effects. I keep a simple log of my coffee habits. This shows patterns in hunger and energy levels. Many people drink more coffee than they realize.

C**affeine sensitivity** varies among people. My friend gets jitters from one cup. I handle three cups easily. Understanding personal limits takes time and observation. Keeping notes helps find the sweet spot.

**Body signals** tell important stories. I notice when coffee makes me feel good or bad. Sometimes my heart races if I drink too much. Other times, it gives perfect energy for morning workouts.

Writing down **mood changes** helps too. Coffee can affect feelings differently throughout the day. Morning coffee usually improves my mood. Afternoon coffee sometimes makes me anxious.

# Special Considerations

Medical conditions need attention due to coffee use. I learned this from my diabetes research. Blood sugar responses to coffee vary widely. Some medications interact with caffeine too.

Pregnancy changes coffee rules completely. My sister reduced coffee during her pregnancy. Her doctor suggested limiting caffeine intake. This applies to nursing mothers too.

Heart conditions require extra care with coffee. High blood pressure patients should monitor their response. Coffee can temporarily raise blood pressure in some people.

Anxiety sufferers might need to be careful. Coffee sometimes makes anxiety worse. I suggest herbal alternatives for very anxious people. Chamomile or peppermint tea works well.

Age affects coffee tolerance too. Older adults often process caffeine more slowly. They might need to reduce intake. Young adults usually handle coffee better.

# Coffee Alternatives and Supplements

**Natural options** provide similar benefits. I tried green tea for weight loss. It contains less caffeine but offers good results. The **antioxidant content** helps burn fat differently than coffee.

Some people choose chicory root drinks. This coffee substitute tastes similar without caffeine. My research shows it helps with appetite control too. Many health food stores stock chicory options.

**Herbal supplements** support weight loss goals. Dandelion root tea works as a natural diuretic. Yerba mate provides energy without jitters. These alternatives help people sensitive to coffee.

The **adaptogens** category interests me. Mushroom coffee blends contain less caffeine. They help manage stress better than regular coffee. Lion's mane and chaga mushrooms show promising results.

# Coffee Quality and Weight Loss

**Bean quality** matters for health benefits. Fresh-ground coffee contains more antioxidants. I notice better results with specialty beans. Cheap coffee often has more toxins.

Organic coffee reduces chemical exposure. My research indicates pesticides affect metabolism. Clean coffee supports better weight loss results. The price difference feels worth it.

**Roasting levels** change coffee's effects. Light roasts contain more caffeine. Dark roasts have different antioxidant profiles. Medium roasts balance both benefits well.

Processing methods affect nutrient content. Wet-processed coffee has less acidity. Dry-processed beans retain more natural compounds. Both methods work for weight loss goals.

Storage impacts coffee potency. I keep beans in airtight containers. Ground coffee loses benefits quickly. Fresh grinding preserves more helpful compounds.

# Long-term Sustainability

**Lifestyle integration** requires balance. Coffee helps weight loss when used wisely. I learned moderation works better than extreme approaches. Daily habits matter more than quick fixes.

Building sustainable patterns takes time. Many people rush coffee benefits. My experience shows steady changes last longer. Small adjustments add up to big results.

The **morning routine** sets daily success. I prepare coffee mindfully each day. This ritual helps maintain healthy habits. Simple steps create lasting changes.

Long-term success needs flexibility. Some days require less coffee. Other days might need more. Listening to body signals guides choices better than strict rules.

Regular evaluation helps maintain progress. Monthly reviews show what works best. Adjusting habits keeps benefits strong. Coffee remains a tool, not a solution.

# Conclusion and Final Recommendations

**Scientific evidence** supports coffee's role in weight loss. My research journey reveals both benefits and cautions. Coffee works as one tool among many for weight management. Smart consumption makes the difference.

Personal experience teaches valuable lessons. Everybody responds differently to coffee. I found my sweet spot through careful observation. Others might need different approaches.

The **weight loss journey** needs a complete approach. Coffee alone won't create miracles. My studies show that combined strategies work best. Exercise, diet, and sleep matter equally.

Final thoughts focus on individuality. Some thrive with coffee support. Others do better without it. The key lies in personal experimentation and honest evaluation. Remember, sustainable weight loss comes from balanced lifestyle choices, not single solutions.",1,1736612040.0,Fat2Fit,0,1.0,False
