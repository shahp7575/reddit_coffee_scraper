Adding more trees, vertical gardens, and open green spaces would not only make the area more visually appealing, but it would also help improve air quality and create a more relaxing and welcoming environment for everyone. Parks or small urban gardens could provide much-needed spots for people to unwind, eat lunch, or just take a break from the busy city atmosphere.

Additionally, I think there's a lot of potential in transforming the old  Spotlight, into more of a cultural hub.This would add a fresh, creative energy to the area and make it more than just a place.More retail stores, caf√©s, and casual hangout spots would also make the area more vibrant and enjoyable. A mix of trendy boutiques, cozy coffee shops, late-night dessert places, and even live music venues or art spaces could help bring the community together and give people more reasons to visit and stay in the area, both during the day and into the evening.

1ltkqb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ltkqb6/is_it_really_over_for_me_and_my_ex/,Is it really over for me and my ex?,"My ex and I were together for two years one year of face-to-face dating, and another year of a long-distance relationship (LDR). Before everything started, I was accepted as a student-athlete in a private school in Metro Manila. I‚Äôve been practicing judo for 14 years, and I had never been in a relationship or had any mutual understanding (MU) with anyone. I‚Äôm also naturally introverted.

My ex was also a student-athlete at the same private school ‚Äî she had been there since around 2017 or 2018. She's sweet, kind, and introverted like me. Our interaction began in 2022 during our first training. At first, I didn‚Äôt notice her because I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship. But according to her, she had a massive crush on me the moment she saw me.

I guess I was considered attractive ‚Äî tall, chinito, moreno, and wearing glasses. She started secretly checking my social media, although I had no idea until a friend pointed it out. During training, I‚Äôd catch her glancing at me, and she‚Äôd shy away whenever we got close.

One day, I jokingly took a photo of myself and my friends using her phone. Later that day, she messaged, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to my phone? üò≠üò≠‚Äù I laughed and apologized. From then on, I started noticing her more, and my feelings slowly grew.

When I went home to my province for Christmas, I felt lonely and down, so I messaged her to open up. She comforted me, and that‚Äôs how our friendship began. I‚Äôd tease her and send mixed signals, and we eventually started calling each other.

That December, during our tournament, I asked her to be my girlfriend ‚Äî and she said yes. Looking back, I wish I had courted her properly. But it was my first relationship, and I was young. Her parents, especially her dad, were strict and only wanted her to focus on school. He found out about us and tried to make her break up with me, but since he was abroad, we stayed together ‚Äî though we cried a lot during that time.

The early months were filled with puppy love. We shared our first kiss and began getting more serious ‚Äî even talking about our future. I wanted to become an engineer, and she dreamed of a high-paying job. We made a lot of plans together.

But problems started to arise. She found photos of women on my phone ‚Äî pictures that were there before we became official. She became insecure and felt she wasn‚Äôt enough. I deleted most of them but shamefully kept some. Despite that, we continued to be affectionate. We would call each other ‚Äúbabe‚Äù when passing by, even though we weren‚Äôt classmates (I was a year ahead).

Eventually, we got very comfortable with each other ‚Äî sharing Twitter accounts, doing weird and silly things together. I knew she had insecurities, especially because of her strict, toxic upbringing. She hated her hands and appearance. So I made it a point to love those parts of her ‚Äî complimenting her daily, telling her how beautiful she was. She gained confidence, even started posting TikToks, and ignored advances from other guys. She was very loyal and clingy, just like me.

But another issue came up. She discovered I followed girl cosplayers and NSFW accounts on Instagram. I made excuses, saying they were for ‚Äúart‚Äù ‚Äî but that was a lie. She forgave me repeatedly, even though I kept hurting her. I regret it deeply.

Still, our first year was beautiful ‚Äî we went on dates, exchanged handmade gifts, celebrated monthsaries and anniversaries with long letters. I met her family, we had intimate moments, and she was there for me during my lowest times. I matured emotionally because of her. I even became closer to God.

But my biggest flaw was my lust. I kept lying about the women on my phone and couldn‚Äôt stop.

As I graduated from senior high and prepared for college, she grew more anxious ‚Äî afraid I‚Äôd cheat or leave her. I always reassured her that I wouldn‚Äôt. Sadly, I wasn‚Äôt accepted into my dream school in Manila, so I had to study back in my hometown. We were devastated, knowing we couldn‚Äôt see each other regularly anymore.

During college, I struggled. Engineering was tough. She supported me while I supported her in senior high. I saved ‚Ç±1,200‚Äì‚Ç±1,400 just to visit her, bringing gifts for her and her mom. Since her parents were strict, I always went to her house instead of her visiting me.

But I noticed a change. She was slowly becoming distant ‚Äî slower replies, less effort in gifts. I still appreciated what she gave, but it hurt. Our fights mostly centered on miscommunication and the girls I followed on social media. She‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just unfollow them?‚Äù and I never had a good answer.

She also made mistakes. She kept talking to a guy I warned her about ‚Äî someone older who gave off bad vibes. She made excuses like, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a nice senior.‚Äù I caught her again and she apologized. Eventually, I matured. I stopped lusting online and started becoming a better person. She appreciated the change, but said it was too late ‚Äî she was already hurt.

In June, I visited her again, but her grandfather passed away, so we ended up at the funeral. Then I saw that she was liking compliments from random guys online ‚Äî something she never used to do. When I confronted her, she apologized.

Her cousins pressured her to break up with me, calling out my lies and betrayals. She defended me, saying, ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt break up because we believe we can fix this.‚Äù But weeks later, things got worse. She asked if it was okay to meet an old male friend from Grade 2. She once had a crush on him, and he only wanted to meet her. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable, and I tried to give signals without directly saying no. She canceled the plan ‚Äî or so I thought.

Later, I found out they were planning to go to a museum, have coffee, and lunch ‚Äî without telling me. I was furious and heartbroken. She insisted it wasn‚Äôt a date, but it felt like one. At 3 AM, she messaged that she canceled it. Then came the breakup message: 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if this is the relationship I want in the future. You always make excuses for your failing grades. I already confronted you about how our relationship is just a cycle, and I wanted something new. But you were okay with how things were. You still keep lusting over me. I just don‚Äôt see myself in a good future with you. I want you to become the best version of yourself ‚Äî not for me, but for you.‚Äù

I was heartbroken and confused. I begged, asked questions, and even asked, ‚ÄúWill we get back together in the future?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure yet.‚Äù That confused me more.

I became severely depressed. I kept checking on her, stalking her, sending her updates showing I had changed. She kept reposting sad TikToks about missing someone, being hurt, or not getting closure ‚Äî making me wonder if she missed me too. But eventually, she unfollowed me and deleted our photos. 
Two weeks after the breakup, I messaged her again ‚Äî hoping for closure. She said:

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre doing all this ‚Äòreflecting‚Äô and ‚Äòchanging‚Äô to be a better person for me, just stop. Please. I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs not the relationship I want.‚Äù

My Questions & Confusion:
Why did she get into a rebound relationship so quickly?and why didn‚Äôt it last?
Why does she repost TikToks about missing me or wanting things to be different?
Why does she still view my stories and check my journal in twitter?
Does she still love me?
Was it really all my fault?
Did she not see my efforts?
Am I that easy to replace or forget?

Help meüôÅ, is it really over for us? Does she just want space because she is emotionallty conflicted? Did I push her away too much? I really love her and I would do anything.",1,1751861501.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Evening and another beautiful day from the Pacific Beaches of Puerto Escondido! I just got back from my friends house after watching the USA lose to Mexico in the final - followed by being given a ton of shit. Its all love though...until I can get a one up on my Mexican friends.

It was a hot and humid one today ‚Äì scratch that, it‚Äôs always hot and humid here. If I can brag for a minute ‚Äì I‚Äôve recently dropped from 24% to 16% body fat, while gaining a few kg of muscle from finally eating right and working out in the high humidity (I was eating up to 4,000 calories a day and the only reason I wasn‚Äôt bigger was because I worked out so hard lol).

So let‚Äôs get physical! I had a bunch of positive effects when I cut the poison. Obviously this isn‚Äôt medical advice or anything ‚Äì speak with a doctor or a licensed professional if need be. I‚Äôm just some random American guy chillin in Mexico sharing my experience.

Let‚Äôs begin: I was born with only one kidney ‚Äì that has continuously healed post-poison. Headaches stopped. Blood pressure normalized. Skin rejuvenated. I‚Äôm 34 and people now say I look 26-28. Recurrent acne stopped. Sweating reduced at least 90%. Groggy mornings stopped. Memory recovered. Dreams restored. I only need 1 cup of coffee instead of 3. Actually, I don‚Äôt need coffee anymore. It‚Äôs a choice.

As u/planktonwearingwigs said: no more volcano poops. Stomach acid recovered. Acid reflux stopped. Heartburn stopped. Nausea stopped. Stomach inflammation stopped. Cramps stopped ‚Äì my goodness, the fucking hangover leg cramps use to make me scream. 
I sleep incredibly well. I‚Äôm so rested. No more waking up in the middle of the night with fast heart rate. No more night sweats. No more crappy hair. No more random bruises that won‚Äôt heal. I‚Äôve put on muscle more quickly. I‚Äôm lifting heavier. Recovering quicker.

So as I finish this dry chicken while writing this post (I only got about 70% done), I would encourage you all to share the positive physical effects sobriety has brought to you!",7,1751861452.0,stopdrinking,15,1.0,False

To see everyone else enjoying the game, trading, and having a good time was lovely. When the job update came out, I loved working at the coffee shop. Thinking of buying the manager game pass in the future.

I enjoyed collecting artifacts on the beach, even picking up shells to sell. In the mines I planned on buying the diamond dragon pet.

Played the game with my older sister, giving me more memories of our times together. - She no longer plays Roblox.

To see it now, voided of life and potential it once inhabited hurts. Pets people collected and once cherished that can't be used, robux that went to waste.

**I'm gonna talk about how I was almost kidnapped in detail since it's actually a bit therapeutic for me to write it out but if you aren't interested in reading just skip down two paragraphs!**


Five days ago, and against my best interest, I was out running at about 10pm. Our school has an open campus that is surrounded by woods and a couple of easy trails. It can sometimes get a bit scary at night. Since my school and it's surrounding neighborhood is very safe, I don't usually worry much when I go out running alone. That particular night, my phone (which was also my flashlight) decided to die mid-run. I should've known that could happen since my phone had been having battery issues (it would die even though it was at 10-20%, smh iPhones). That immediately set me into a panic since I was on a pretty secluded trail with very minimal lighting. I stopped running to fumble with my phone to see if it would miraculatousy turn back on but nope. I was also wearing light-reflective leggings so I was definitely visible to others.

‚Äã

I was about to start running again when I noticed a guy approaching me. I hadn't noticed him prior to this but he was probably hidden in the woods next to the trail (there's like a public bathroom and a picnic table). He was smoking a cigarette and had his phone in hand and I immediately got bad vibes. By the time I realized where he even came from, he was already only a couple feet away from me where he called out, ""Miss, are you lost?"" His speech sounded a bit slurred and he reeked of cigarette smoke which led me to think that he was probably a homeless drunk living near the picnic table and public bathroom. I told him no and that I was on my way to my friend's house (despite my athletic gear lol). Then he gave me a once over, whistled, and said, ""damn girl, you look delicious! look at that ass!"" and he fucking slapped my ass. I think I yelped and immediately stepped away but he reached out and grabbed my wrist. I thought it was actually the end for me and I screamed as loud as I can but there was literally no one near me. My heart was beating out of my chest and I felt like I was going to fucking faint. He chuckled and said, ""Shut up, no one can hear you anyway."" My heart was beating out of my chest and there was so much adrenaline coursing through my body.

‚Äã

Thank the fucking stars for what happened next. From behind me, the trail suddenly became lit and I realized there was a biker heading my way. Then I heard him call, ""Maddie?? Is that you? Holy shit, what are you doing out so late?"" The guy muttered, ""shit"" and immediately let go and began running away. The biker got closer and immediately braked and got off. I have no fucking clue who this guy is and he doesn't know me either. He asked me if I was okay and what that guy was doing and I explained to him everything that happened and almost got on my knees to thank him. He looked just as freaked out as me. He asked where I live and I told him I was a student at \[name of college\] and he told me that he's a grad student at the same school. He also immediately took of his sweatshirt and gave it to me to wear since I was only in a tank top. He then walked me all the way back to my house (around 2 miles). One the way, he tried to ask me about school and stuff but I was a bit too frazzled to give any sensible response so he mostly talked about himself. He told me he was a second-year CS student at the engineering school. He likes to cook, his favorite show is the Office, he enjoys playing basketball but he sucks, he works part time at Google, and more stuff I can't remember. He also gave me his email and number and told me that if I needed him to talk with the police/file a report to just shoot him a message or call. He apologized for what happened and said that he was glad I was safe. I thanked him a billion more times and went home.

‚Äã

The next day, I texted him and thanked him again and also went and filed a police report. But I feel like I can't thank him enough. He literally saved my life. Without a doubt, if he just kept biking or didn't see me, I would've been possibly killed. I don't know how I can show my gratitude. I really want to take him out to dinner...but would that be weird? I also have to return his sweatshirt. I'm also a bit infatuated by him?

‚Äã

Do you guys think that's a good idea or is there anything else I can do to show my gratitude? If I do go about asking him to dinner, what should I say? Should I call or text?

‚Äã

Btw, I know a lot of you are going to ask if I'm planning on seeing a therapist and the answer is yes, I've already booked an appointment. Although I think I'm dealing with it pretty well and have mostly put it behind me, I know that it is for the best that I see a therapist for a bit.

‚Äã

TL;DR: I was almost kidnapped and a complete stranger, who turned out to be a grad student at my school, saved me. He walked me all the way back to my house and gave me his number and email for if I needed anything. I want to ask him out to dinner as a sign of gratitude. Should I?

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/o1E9CKl7fw)  **Sept 30, 2018 (1 month later)**

Hi guys!

I'm back with the long-awaited update. But first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! I definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

A lot of you suggested that I just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so I could return his sweatshirt and thank him. That's basically exactly what I did. 

I shot him a text and told him that I had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. Then I asked him (in a double text) if I could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. He actually didn't respond for a good day and I was really starting to feel like I'd totally overstepped but then he did! He first told me that it was great that I filed the report and then he asked me how I was feeling. He also said that I didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. So we scheduled to have coffee on a Saturday morning. 

Going into our meeting, I was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 minutes early. So I sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. To be honest, I wasn't even that sure I knew what he looked like. The entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, I barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since I was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. I just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

Then, this really tall dude walks in, scans the shop, sees me and then gives me an awkward smile and waves. I didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so I just blurted out, ""Woah, your eyes are actually blue, I thought they were brown haha."" I wanted to crawl into a hole after I said that but he laughed and said, ""Yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" Then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay) and we sat down. First things first, I gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. We ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the Office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. I also asked him why he decided to call me ""Maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

So yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. But he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. So we then went about five days with no contact until I came across a meme about the Office and decided on a whim to send it to him. It ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. Next morning, I was feeling bold again and after much debating, I sent him a text that said, ""Hey, can I please take you out to lunch? Coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" 

He said yes and this time I managed to successfully pay for our meal. I wore a nice sundress to lunch and he said, ""I love that dress! You look really good!"" We had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant I realized that he left his phone on the chair so I grabbed it and gave it to him. (This is important later on). 

About two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""Hey, can I take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" OMG. He's too cute. (For those of you who might not have caught on, he was mimicking how I asked him out). Anyway, of course I said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

Ahhh I like him a lot but I have no idea how he feels about me. Maybe I'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) But so far, that's what has happened. 

TL;DR: I asked him out to coffee! Then I asked him out to lunch! Then he asked me out to dinner!

Hi again guys!

This is the long-awaited second update! But first, I have to thank all of you again for being so so supportive. You guys literally all made my day with your positivity.

So...the dinner ""date"". I woke up Sunday morning at like 11:00am (don't judge) and saw that there was already a text from him at 7:30am saying, ""Hey, does [cute little mediterranean place] sound good for tonight?"" I'm at that stage where I'll smile and giggle at whatever text he sends me so after doing that, I told him that it sounded great and asked him what time we should meet. We decided on 7:00pm and he said, ""great! pick you up at 6:45?"" to which I said, ""you remember where I live?"" and he said, ""how could I not? it was where I parted with my favorite sweater""¬†*sigh*

He knocked on my door on time that night but I, embarrassingly, was already waiting at the door so I whipped the door open after he knocked once. Oh my gosh, the sight that met my eyes was beautiful. (I'm just now realizing that this reddit account has turned into my diary). He was wearing this light blue dress shirt (with the sleeves rolled up) that complimented his eyes with some nicely-fitted black jeans and ahhhhhhhh, he looked so nice. Then he gave me this awkward little smile and said, ""You ready to go?""

I followed him to his car and he opened the passenger door for me. I swooned. The car ride was a bit awkward at first but then he asked me if I wanted to put on my Spotify and we ended up singing to Mr. Brightside. Turns out, he's a great singer. I asked him about it and he was in an acapella group all four years of college and is some low-key cello prodigy (you bet I searched up him playing cello as a kid after I got home that night).

We got to the restaurant, waited in line for a bit, then finally sat down and ordered. Once again, the conversation just flowed so nicely. We talked about literally everything but I got to learn more about him this time around. I asked him if he used Reddit and he looked confused for a second and then said no. I think we're safe (for now...) guys haha. He made fun of my hands being small and then held up his hand for me to place mine against to compare. I swooned again. Then we had a nice conversation about how annoying contacts were after he choked on his water laughing at something and his contact shifted. Anyway, dinner ended too soon and it might've been just me, but I swear both of us were trying to walk as slow as possible back to the car.

After we pulled up to my house, we had that moment where neither of us knew what to say or do so I said, ""Thanks for dinner, [his name]"", let go of my purse, opened the car door, and stepped out. Naturally, he said, ""Hey, wait your purse‚Äî"" to which I responded very dramatically, ""Oh no, I forgot my purse thank you! I guess I have to take you out sometime to say thanks..."" He got it immediately and burst out laughing, face palmed into his steering wheel, and said, ""Okay okay, good night and text me when!""

Needless to say, I could not sleep that night.

Fast-forward to Saturday night. On a whim, I text him, ""sooo, I'm about to have an office marathon. do you wanna come over and we can order takeout?"" He takes half an hour to respond but says, ""that actually sounds amazing, count me in""

He comes in sweatpants, a hoodie, and glasses (oh my god why does he look so cute in glasses), and a bag of chips and guac. SWOON. We doordash Indian and start watching on my couch. At first we're sitting like a good foot apart but then three episodes in, our legs are flush against each other's. Somewhere between the fifth and sixth episode, he leans back into the couch and I do to. By the seventh episode, my head is on his shoulder and his arm has moved behind me (sadly not wrapped around me though). After like two more episodes, he began dozing off and I poked him and asked if he needed to go back and sleep. He told me he's been staying up really late doing this project for one of his classes so he's basically been only sleeping five hours a night. After hearing that, I shoved his up and told him he needed to sleep before 12am today (it was already like 11:00pm). At my door, he said sleepily, ""Tonight was really fun. I hope we can do it again."" He just looked so cute and kissable at that moment so I just threw my arms around him and hugged him. He circled his arms around my waist and he was the first to pull back. But he didn't pull back all the way and we had a moment where I was trying to look anywhere but his lips and he was doing the same. Then he leaned in a bit, closed the distance and kissed me. I may have melted on the spot. It was really short but it was so sweet. He pulled back said good night and left.

Needless to say, I could not sleep again that night.

That's what went on in the past week. To be very honest, I'm still not sure if he really likes me. Maybe he was really tired when he kissed me and wasn't thinking straight, who knows. This morning, he texted me and said he slept the best he's had in a while. I don't know what the next step is but...I'm over the fucking moon right now.

TL;DR: I swooned for an entire week. Oh also, we kissed.

I've been working in Vietnam for a year now, but I feel like I still haven't fully explored Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City. I'm sure there are some hidden gems out there that l've missed.

I finally have 3 days off to explore the city, and I would really appreciate any recommendations you might have. This could be activities, parks, hotels, or coffee shops that are worth visiting.

I'm starting to build my itinerary and I really want to make the most out of these 3 days off. I'm usually very busy with work, so I want to take this chance to finally explore more of HCM.

I'm particularly interested in: 
‚Ä¢ Cozy coffee shops or ones with a nice view or overlooking spots 
‚Ä¢ Local parks where I can relax or people-watch 
‚Ä¢ Street food like banh mi, Vietnamese pancakes, ice cream, bread ‚Äî basically anything local and affordable ‚Ä¢Restaurants or small food spots that serve burgers, pasta, pizza, or fries. (If none of those are common here, I'd love to hear about must-try restaurants that are affordable and worth it!)

I'd prefer to skip malls for this trip since I usually end up there anyway.

I'm hoping to experience a mix of tourist favorites and local spots to make the most of my mini staycation. Thank you in advance for your suggestions! ü§ç",1,1751860894.0,Vietnam_Tourism,0,1.0,False

I plan to use this post to capture other smaller changes that happen during the rest of the month before the big change next month.

1ltkcee,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rToronto_Clean/comments/1ltkcee/28_m4f_tired_but_cant_sleep/,"28 M4F - Tired, but can't sleep","Hey there! I‚Äôm on the hunt for someone who‚Äôs effortlessly cool, totally chill, and maybe just the right amount of weird.  I‚Äôm looking for a connection that feels natural, fun, and maybe a little unpredictable in the best way possible.

I‚Äôm the kind of person who jumps into random hobbies with zero hesitation, just to see what sparks joy. One month I‚Äôm teaching myself guitar riffs, the next I‚Äôm deep into brewing kombucha or trying to master origami (spoiler: my paper cranes look more like paper blobs). I pick things up fast, but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm prone to getting sidetracked by the next shiny interest that catches my eye. It‚Äôs a chaotic process, but it keeps life exciting.

Friends describe me as the laid-back type, and I‚Äôd have to agree. I‚Äôm all about cozy hoodies, jeans that feel like a hug, and hair that‚Äôs got a mind of its own (I call it ‚Äúorganized chaos‚Äù). I stand at about 5‚Äô11‚Äù, weigh around 180 lbs, and have a medium build I'm working on.  Sarcasm is my love language, and I‚Äôm always down for clever banter or deep, thought-provoking conversations that sneak up on you. Life‚Äôs too short to take too seriously, so I try to keep things light but meaningful.

If you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves learning random skills (bonus points if they‚Äôre totally useless but fun), trading playful roasts with a side of affection, or just vibing over something hilariously dumb like bad reality TV or niche internet memes, we‚Äôd probably get along. Let‚Äôs grab a coffee, swap stories about our weirdest hobbies, or just see where the conversation takes us.

Apparently I am an adult - well that‚Äôs what tax man says - yet somehow I have the sweet tooth of a 3y.o who just got their hands on a plate of fairy bread. 

Most of my life, I thought coffee was just bitter, and have been slapping syrups and sugar into it, not knowing what was to befall me. 

Sensory Lab has no syrups. They barely offer sugar. They don‚Äôt need it. 

I am ruined. This coffee tastes like heaven and there is no bitterness. Every coffee I have that begets a sweetener is now a bitter reminder of what I could be drinking. Vanilla and caramel masks no longer satisfy‚Ä¶

Back in April, I had to medically withdrawal from school, causing me to move back home until I could go back to school again. In my daze of trying to get myself healthy again, I had forgotten about the bags of green onions, broccoli, and celery that I had in my fridge and the two gallon-sized Ziploc bags of chopped veggies I had in my freezer. The produce was bought in late March, and I did not get to come back to my apartment until 2 weeks ago... leaving the produce to rot for 3 months.

Color me surprised when I find the produce in the fridge (rotten) with the most god-awful smell and dead gnats all in the bottom portion of my fridge (it's a side-by-side fridge). I do live in the southern United States and for some reason, gnats and fruit flies are ESPECIALLY horrible this summer. I started a whole fridge clean out because I had an assumption that at some point, there may have been a power outage. I cleaned EVERYTHING out and I removed the shelves and buckets, wiping down every surface I could touch with disinfectant spray and Clorox wipes. Then, my mom hand-washed the inside of the fridge and the shelving/buckets with Dawn dish soap and vinegar... but the smell still lingered. We put a small can of coffee grounds on a lower shelf, and two boxes of baking soda where the upper air flow vents are located in the fridge... the smell is still there. Regarding the freezer, I did the same deconstruction, cleaning, and added the box of baking soda (also found dead gnats/fruit flies in there as well). The water filter was changed and the water to the apartment was turned back on. Guess what... the smell is still there. The worst part, the ice my fridge makes tastes and smells like rotten produce, and the inventory of my freezer and fridge smells like the rotten produce as well, and I'm honestly at a loss on what to do and I am overly embarrassed. And, no joke, I find a new scatter of dead gnats/fruit flies at the bottom of the fridge and freezer EVERY DAY. I have poured over the model of my fridge for any hint on what to clean [(Whirlpool mo. ED2GVEXVD01)](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/manual/4x0py6u543-001198/whirlpool-ed2gvexvd01-side-by-side-refrigerator-parts), and nothing jumps out at me.

So, I believe that it isn't the water (it tastes fine), but maybe something to do with the air that passes back-and-forth from the fridge to the freezer.

If there is ANYTHING anyone can recommend I do (without having to buy a new fridge lol), I would forever be in your debt.",1,1751859999.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

I'm a Summer Intern at a big bank (21m). I have a pretty Associate on my team (29?) and we've been getting closer and closer. Had a work happy hour last week (which she asked if I was invited and said I should definitely attend) and she was lingering around me and joined in on one conversation, standing right next to me. I went to talk to another colleague one on one after that and she joined in shortly after. Was an awesome 30 min conversation, she laughed a ton and we only dispersed after me and the other guy had to get going home

the day after, the office was dead and barely anyone was in (either WFH or vacation) ahead of the long weekend. However, as an intern, I gotta be in every day. But her being an Associate, she practically never comes in on the day before weekends, and even on busy days, she usually sits farther from the team in her own area for extra focus. We have first come first serve type of seating too. To my surprise, she comes in at around 10, walks pretty far straight to my seat (I was sitting alone in my usual seat far from the entrance, so she prob knew/remembered my 5x requirement) and sits right next to me then starts chatting about our August plans.

We chatted about non-work stuff the whole day since it was slow. I mentioned inviting the team to the bar for my 21st and she said she was ""super free"" and down to join the next week. She also seems to remember and ask about numerous things I tell her about myself (such as my birthday), which feels genuine.

And yes, she made it pretty clear that she's single, so no guessing there. Would have never even considered

I can't stop thinking about this, and my best friend told me to just shoot my shot on the final week and calmly/politely ask her to get beers near office one on one and give her an easy way out (""i know you're busy so no worries if not"" or something like that) in my proposition. Or just a one on one coffee chat.

Thankful for any advice, as I'm genuinely lost and have only a month left before I depart.",2,1751859709.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Nung bago pa lang ako, I was warned by teammates about her habit of pangungutang and pahirapan ng singil. So dumating na nga ang time na nanghihiram na siya sakin and the utang accumulated to around 5k na since last Juanuary saying it was for gatas and diapers ng baby niya or di kaya bills na magde-deadline na.

For the past years wala namang issue sa akin na manghiram sya although nadedelay ng 3-4 months sa promised date na babayaran okay lang kasi it was my extra money. Ngayon, as I was eating early lunch with my colleague, she was ranting about Ate Betty regarding sa sinalihan nilang Fun Run last month na ngayon pa lang daw sya nagbayad. Kesyo pahirapan daw ng pagsingil tapos sinasabi daw sa kasama ko ‚Äúsus maliit lang 1k sayo‚Äù kaya nainis yung colleague ko. Naisip ko matagal tagal din akong di nag followup ng singil so I tried asking Ate Betty if she can pay partially, since  delay din sahod and I could use extra cash.

Paroxysmal AFIB?,"On Juneteenth, I took Unisom (over the counter sleep aid for the first time ever) at 1am after two bad nights of sleep. Woke up at, HR 122, BP 190/107. It dropped to 169/99 within 30 minutes. By the time I got to urgent care around 9am, BP was 130/76 and EKG looked normal. The physician assistant at the urgent care refused to give me a cardiologist referral.

The day before: minimal sleep (I haven‚Äôt measured BP but could have a BP spike as well), 2 cups of coffee instead of 1 at work. Had a diarrhea the day before without eating anything suspicious.

The week after I experienced a little bit less severe spike with BP 170/100 and HR 100. This time I didn‚Äôt take any new medicine. In both instances I had to urinate in the middle of the night few times right after the spike had woke me up and that‚Äôs when the BP started going down. My toes felt cold and my mouth was super dry. Again, it went down to 136/89 HR 79 by 8am. Also had a diarrhea the day before but hadn‚Äôt eaten anything unusual. Last Saturday night it was 150/85 HR 78.

I have my primary care doctor appointment scheduled tomorrow, and I‚Äôd like to be prepared on what to ask for, what tests to request, and what might‚Äôve caused that spike. Definitely not taking Unisom going forward. I am hoping to get a cardiologist referral but will probably need to wait a month or two for the visit. Is there any prescription I can request to manage my spikes? I started taking magnesium and quit caffeine last week.

I am 37M with Healy BMI: 23.7, non smoker and rarely drink alcohol. Only take loratadine for allergies for few months per year. My standard BP is within the 120-138/ 75-90 range.

Pyrithyldione,

Methyprylon,

glutethimide,

Apronal,

Bromisoval,

Acecarbromal,

Carbromal,

and amobarbital

# Piperidione synthesis write up

Whats needed;

Diethyl malonate, Sodium ethoxide (made by adding sodium metal pieces to absolute ethanol carefully), Ethyl bromide (or ethyl iodide), Ethanol

# Step 1:

In a dry flask, add about 50 mL ethanol, Slowly add small pieces of sodium metal (about 1-2 g) carefully (use gloves, eye protection, fume hood). The ethanol will bubble as it reacts forming sodium ethoxide. Stir with magnetic stir bar until sodium dissolves, Your sodium ethoxide solution is ready.

# Step 2:

Add 10 g diethyl malonate to the sodium ethoxide solution. Stir well, Slowly add 5 mL ethyl bromide dropwise to the mixture (this is roughly 2 equivalents), Stir the mixture and heat gently on the hotplate to about 50¬∞C for 6 hours. Keep stirring continuously, After reaction is done, cool the mixture.

# Step 3:

Transfer the reaction mixture to a beaker and add 50 mL of 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Stir and heat at 80¬∞C for 1 hour to hydrolyze esters into acids, Cool, then acidify slowly with dilute HCl or vinegar until pH \~2 (you should see precipitate forming), Collect the precipitate by filtration or decant the liquid carefully, Heat the acid solid gently to 100-120¬∞C for 30 minutes to decarboxylate (this will release CO2 and form the Œ≤-keto acid).

# Step 4:

Dissolve the Œ≤-keto acid from step 3 in about 50 mL ethanol, Add 5 g ammonium acetate (NH4OAc), Heat under reflux on your hotplate stirrer (around 80¬∞C) for 6-8 hours with stirring, Cool the reaction mixture. The product should precipitate out or can be extracted with an organic solvent like ethyl acetate, Filter, wash, and dry the product.

# You should have 3,3-Diethyl-2,4-Dioxopiperidine.

# 

# Methylpentynol synthesis write up

Whats needed;

1-Butyne, Acetone, Potassium tert-butoxide, Anhydrous Ethanol or THF, Distilled water + 5% HCl, MgSO‚ÇÑ or Na‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ

# Step 1

Place a clean 100 mL round-bottom flask on a magnetic stirrer, Add a magnetic stir bar into the flask, Pour in 30 mL of anhydrous ethanol (or THF if available) as solvent, (Optional) Place the flask in an ice bath if you're concerned about gas evolution.

# Step 2:

1. Add 1-butyne (\~0.7 mL) to the solvent in the flask using a pipette or syringe, Slowly add 1.12 g of potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in small portions while stirring, Do this slowly to avoid excessive bubbling (H‚ÇÇ gas is released), You should see bubbling ‚Äî this is a sign the acetylide is forming.

# Step 3

After 10‚Äì15 minutes of stirring (make sure bubbling has slowed), add acetone (\~0.58 mL) slowly using a dropper or syringe, Stir the mixture at room temperature or gently heat to 40‚Äì50¬∞C using a hot plate for 2 hours.

# Step 4:

Let the mixture cool if heated, Slowly add 20 mL of distilled water to quench the reaction, Add \~5 mL of 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl) to neutralize the basic mixture and protonate the alkoxide to form the alcohol, You should see two layers forming.

# Step 5

If you have ether or hexane: Add \~20 mL of ether or hexane to the flask, Transfer everything into a separatory funnel, shake gently, and allow the layers to separate, Collect the organic (top) laye**r**, which contains your product, Dry this layer over MgSO‚ÇÑ (just a pinch, swirl it), Filter or decant the dried solution into a clean container, Evaporate the solvent using the hot plate on low heat or in a fume hood.

If you don‚Äôt have ether\*\*:\*\* Let the reaction sit, Skim off the top organic layer with a pipette or decant carefully, Dry it manually (e.g. paper towel wick), though this is less precise

Step 6

The final product, 3-methyl-1-pentyn-3-ol, is a colorless to slightly yellow liquid\*\*,\*\* You can confirm purity by smell (sweetish alcohol-like) and optional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) if available.

# Pyrithyldione synthesis write up

Whats needed;

ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl ketone, Ammonium acetate, ethanol

# 1.

To a clean beaker or flask, add; 10 mL ethyl acetoacetate\*\*,\*\* 4.5 mL diethyl ketone, 5 g ammonium acetate, 30 mL ethanol, Add a magnetic stir bar.

# 2.

Place the flask on the magnetic stir hotplate, Stir the mixture and heat to 70‚Äì80¬∞C (gentle reflux), Keep stirring and heating for 6 hours, You may see the solution become darker or thicker.

# 3.

After 6 hours, remove from heat, Allow it to cool to room temperature, then optionally chill in an ice bath, A solid should begin to form ‚Äî this is your product.

# 4.

Filter the mixture through filter paper or a coffee filter, Wash the solid with a little cold ethanol, Let it dry in open air or in a warm place.

# Methyprylon synthesis write up

whats needed;

Acetylacetone (2,4-pentanedione), Diethyl bromide (or ethyl bromide), Methylamine solution (40% aqueous),Potassium carbonate (K2CO3), Ethanol (95%), Water

# Step 1:

Add 5 g acetylacetone (\~0.05 mol) to a 100 mL beaker, Add 30 mL ethanol and stir with the magnetic stirrer to dissolve acetylacetone, Add 10 g potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a base to deprotonate acetylacetone. Stir well, Add 8 mL ethyl bromide dropwise (slowly, to control reaction heat), Stir the mixture at 50¬∞C on the hotplate for 6 hours. This allows alkylation at the active methylene carbon (C-3), After completion, cool the mixture and filter to remove solids (KBr salt and excess K2CO3), Evaporate the ethanol under reduced pressure or let stand overnight for the product to precipitate.

# Step 2:

Dissolve the crude product from Step 1 in 20 mL ethanol in a beaker, Add 10 mL 40% aqueous methylamine solution slowly while stirring at room temperature, Stir the mixture on the hotplate at 40¬∞C for 4‚Äì5 hours to promote ring closure (cyclization), After the reaction time, cool the mixture to room temperature or ice bath to precipitate the product, Filter the solid product and wash with cold water, Dry the product in air.

# glutethimide synthesis write up

# Whats needed:

ethyl acetoacetate, Phenylacetic acid, Ammonium acetate, Glacial Acetic Acid, distilled water, ethanol / isopropanol

# Step 1:

place a magnetic stir bar into a 250 mL beaker or flask, Add the following into the flask: 3 mL ethyl acetoacetate, 1.4 g phenylacetic acid, 1.2 g ammonium acetate, 10 mL glacial acetic acid, Put the flask on the hotplate with stirring turned on (medium speed).

# Step 2:

slowly heat the mixture to about 110‚Äì120¬∞C (just below boiling of acetic acid You can monitor this with a thermometer. The solution will become more uniform and may thicken slightly, Keep stirring and heating for 6 hours, If you see crystals forming early, don't worry‚Äîthat's normal, Make sure not to overheat or let the solvent evaporate too much.

# Step 3:

After heating, remove from the hotplate and let the flask cool down for 15 minutes, Prepare a beaker with about 100 mL cold water + ice, Slowly pour the warm reaction mixture into the ice water while stirring gently, A white or off-white solid should form immediately, Stir it for another 15 minutes in the ice bath to let it settle.

# Step 4:

Use a funnel and filter paper to filter out the solid (gravity or vacuum filtration), Wash the collected solid with cold distilled water 3 times to remove acetic acid and byproducts.

# Step 5:

Dissolve the crude product in hot ethanol or isopropanol (20 mL)Heat until it fully dissolves, then let it cool slowly to room temperature, Place in the freezer or ice bath to form clean crystals, Filter again and dry the final product in a warm place (under 50¬∞C).

# 4 tpes of Ueride And Bromoueride based non-barbiturate sedative hynotics :

# 1. Allylisopropylacetylurea

What you need:

* **Isopropylacetic acid**¬†(cheap organic acid)
* **Thionyl chloride (SOCl2)**¬†‚Äî to make acid chloride
* **Allylamine**¬†(a simple amine with an allyl group)
* **Urea**¬†(very cheap)

1ltk0m5,https://i.redd.it/ltz26vlngdbf1.jpeg,AIO Is it JUST a coffee table?,"(photo is convo with my sister... explanation below) I'm moving in with my boyfriend and have a bunch of furniture. I have gotten rid of many things because they wont fit in his apartment. He has been meaning to get rid of some furniture as well so we can fit in this one bedroom. I have a coffee table that I am absolutely in love with, its a medium brown with a glass center. I spent lots of time finding it, and paid about 200$ for, and even though its small, its vintage and matches my personality. He has a coffee table thats larger, fits the space better, so its center in the livingroom. I think my small square coffee table would look fine as an end table beside the couch or next to the entertainment center. I've been moving things around all day and he comes home from work telling me I need to get rid of it. I try and tell him that its one of my favorite things and I would be willing to sacrifice any other furniture in order to keep it. He says it doesn't mesh with his dark(deep brown and black) furniture at all and his compromise was to put it in a storage unit. I try to explain to him that its not something I can get rid of, and I can't afford to buy a storage unit for one coffee table. I call my sister and ask what would be reasonable, and she says I should figure out if its ""his house"" or ""our house,"" and act accordingly. She is willing to take care of it, but she lives 4 hours away. I ask him if I am supposed to get rid of it and bend to his rule, or is this our house where we can coexist our things even if they don't match perfectly. He claims that putting it in storage or giving it to my friends IS compromising, and says I have a month to figure it out. He then addresses what my sister advised and says that she has no say because she doesn't live with a man or has had a successful relationship with one. She is the hardest working woman I know who has had two kids, raised them on her own, and has bought her home. Plus shes 22 years OLDER than me. Her kids are our age! I have a month to figure it out I guess, even after I went off on him. He says its just a coffee table.",2,1751859140.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False
1ltk09c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ltk09c/grinder_recommendations/,Grinder Recommendations?,"Hi everyone! My boyfriend's birthday is coming up and I'm looking to get him a grinder for his pour over coffee. Please bare with me as I really don't know much about coffee or even how to make it as I can't drink coffee myself anymore. I've been doing a little research and have read through a lot of the grinder recommendations in this group already but I'm having a hard time narrowing it down or understanding the difference between them honestly. 

For a little background, my boyfriend used to manage a coffee shop and worked as a barista there. However, he's never really prioritized his own set up for at home. He's a black coffee drinker but prefers lighter roasts. I'm sadly not sure which other specific flavor profiles he likes the most but I do know he likes to try different types so a good all around grinder might be good. He likes making pour over coffee the best but has complained that he doesn't like his grinder for it (I sadly don't know which one it is but it looks like one of the kind of generic electric ones from Target, Walmart, etc). 

From my research, I'm leaning towards a hand grinder for him but I am happy to hear suggestions for electric ones. I'll see if I can casually ask what his preference would be but I know he would be excited about whatever gets good reviews/is highly recommended. I've seen a lot of recommendations for the Comandante C40 but it is a little more than I wanted to spend budget wise and I'm not sure he would want me to spend that much on him. I've seen a lot of recommendations for the 1Zpresso ones as well but I don't know enough to understand which specific model would be best. For electric, I saw the Fellow Ode 2 mentioned a lot but it does seem ""over kill"" to me as he doesn't drink/make espresso drinks for himself and is only ever making coffee for himself. 

Does anyone have any other recommendations or reviews for the two I mentioned? Thank you so much in advance and I'm sorry for not knowing much about coffee/making it! ",1,1751859105.0,pourover,9,0.6,False
1ltk02j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthloomKETO/comments/1ltk02j/the_truth_about_starting_keto_without_a_gym/,‚ÄúThe Truth About Starting Keto Without a Gym‚Äù,"I used to think the only way to lose weight was to hit the gym 6 days a week.  
Run. Lift. Sweat buckets.  
But the truth?

I lost my **first 10kg** without ever touching a dumbbell.  
No gym. No burpees. No HIIT.  
Just a tiny shift ‚Äî in my **kitchen**.

# ü•ò It Started With Food ‚Äî Not Fitness

I was tired. Broke. Out of breath just climbing stairs.  
There was *no way* I was going to stick to a gym routine when I couldn‚Äôt even stick to breakfast.

So I focused on the one thing I could control: **what I ate**.

I stumbled onto keto by accident. I was looking up ‚Äúlow-carb ways to control sugar cravings‚Äù ‚Äî and boom, I found a simple plan.

# ‚ö°Ô∏èThe First 3 Keto Swaps I Made:

1. **Morning coffee instead of cereal** ‚Üí Replaced sugary cereal with black coffee + 1 tsp MCT oil or butter. *Energy without crashes.*
2. **Eggs and veggies instead of bread** ‚Üí 2 boiled eggs, saut√©ed spinach, and a few nuts kept me full till lunch. *No more 11am hangry mood.*
3. **Cauliflower rice stir-fry instead of takeout** ‚Üí Same spices, same flavor, fewer carbs. *Comfort without guilt.*

# üìâ The Weight Started Dropping

* 1kg gone in the first week
* 4kg down in the first month
* 10kg lost without *any* workouts
* Just **home-cooked food**, water, and sleep

And the crazy part? I actually had more energy. So much that I *wanted* to walk more. Move more. Do more.

# üß† The Real Transformation Was Mental

It wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhacking‚Äù my body. It was about trusting myself to stay consistent.  
No gym. No equipment. Just me, my stove, and a new mindset.

1ltjzmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningCirclejerk/comments/1ltjzmt/barista_was_missing_today/,Barista was missing today :(,"So I was out at the cafe, recovering after my recovery run today waiting in line to order a half dozen or so eggs to boof when I noticed the usual barista was missing for the second time this week! 

Once I got to the front of the line, I asked the replacement barista where she was, mentioning that I already knew she had missed work previously this week because she was out at REI buying run-of-mill reliable everyday lawnmowing shoes. 

The replacement barista said she was out on a date with another customer, but that she was running late because she got held up finishing a half shift earlier today. I guess he was a real tool? The replacement barista mentioned how he kept checking his watch and smirking slightly and that he kept flexing his calves while wearing some weird tight socks. I guess he also mentioned that he wanted some coffee because he was sick of how low his heart rate was? 

Anyways, after the replacement barista told me everything and I was boofing my third egg, I finally came to the conclusion of how weird it was that she would go on a running date in the first place considering she doesn't even have the shoes for it. 

After boofing my last egg and waiting around for a bit (my wife's bf said not to come home until 7:00), I think I saw the same runner while I was on my way home. He was prancing around in these tall dinghies (maybe 3:20/km pace?) with the same tall socks that I heard mention of. As I walked by, I heard the runner talking to some other random stranger he approached about how he just finished a 15 km run to clear his head and his pace was 3:00/km (yeah right, buddy).

1ltjyr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ltjyr5/advice_immediately_please_my_boyfriend_29m_is/,Advice Immediately Please! My boyfriend (29M)  is kicking me(26F) out of his house because I got an attitude over pregnancy decision.,"My Boyfriend (29M) and I (26F) decided to stop having protected sex. We decided that we were okay with the out come if I became pregnant. He would not cum inside of me he would always pull out. When I missed my period and took a test he began to worry saying he isn't financially stable to support us at the moment because he is in limbo with his current deal. He said it is up to me if I want to keep the baby or not. Although he wasn't pissed, he hasn't exactly been excited or generally positive about this news. 

I scheduled an appointment for an ultrasound and he went with me. In the lobby he slouched over saying he was tired, and during the ultrasound he was on his phone. After the appointment I asked him what he was thinking and he said I already told you how I feel about it and I don't want to keep repeating myself. This upset me so I started to cry because I didn't feel supported. On the way home he stopped to get coffee and I could see him waiting in line and he didn't reach for his phone once. I yelled ""fuck"" and got out the car to start walking to the house. He pulled up to me and I got in the car as I'm on the phone with planned parenthood.

 As we pull into the house he is like you need to talk to me and I said no because I'm irritated, annoyed, zoned out & pissed off. He said that was unacceptable and started yelling who do you think you are? Who do you think you are talking to? He continued yelling into the house repeating this same stuff. I walk into the closet to get a change of clothes, didn't close the door behind me or anything and he follows me in and begins punching and kicking the door breaking it completely. Its so close to me I can feel the breeze on my face. At this point I'm in shock so I'm not saying anything. He keeps yelling beginning to get personal and calls me a bitch, telling me I'm ungrateful. He gets so close yelling at me I stand up (mattress is on the floor because he has back issues) and start yelling back saying he can't talk to me like that. He then said something so out of line that I take the coffee and throw it at him because I feel so bullied at this point it was the only thing I could do to fight back. 

He then starts telling me to get out of his house and began breaking stuff that I've given him and took my stuff out his room, taking things from me that he has bought for me that I was clearly using (he never wanted it before). He lives in California and Im from Ohio so he knows I don't have anywhere to go out here. It definitely got worse after that but I just decided to be quiet for the rest of the day and I packed all my stuff up. He says he won't help me get home.

 I generally don't get pissed off at him let alone let him know that I'm pissed off so I don't think he took it well. On the other hand he gets upset over simple things and I don't say anything about it. He says I'm talking one day and making him a bad person. He is basically upset with me that I'm upset with him.

Acecarbromal,

Carbromal,

and amobarbital

# Piperidione synthesis write up

Whats needed;

Diethyl malonate, Sodium ethoxide (made by adding sodium metal pieces to absolute ethanol carefully), Ethyl bromide (or ethyl iodide), Ethanol

# Step 1:

In a dry flask, add about 50 mL ethanol, Slowly add small pieces of sodium metal (about 1-2 g) carefully (use gloves, eye protection, fume hood). The ethanol will bubble as it reacts forming sodium ethoxide. Stir with magnetic stir bar until sodium dissolves, Your sodium ethoxide solution is ready.

# Step 2:

Add 10 g diethyl malonate to the sodium ethoxide solution. Stir well, Slowly add 5 mL ethyl bromide dropwise to the mixture (this is roughly 2 equivalents), Stir the mixture and heat gently on the hotplate to about 50¬∞C for 6 hours. Keep stirring continuously, After reaction is done, cool the mixture.

# Step 3:

Transfer the reaction mixture to a beaker and add 50 mL of 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Stir and heat at 80¬∞C for 1 hour to hydrolyze esters into acids, Cool, then acidify slowly with dilute HCl or vinegar until pH \~2 (you should see precipitate forming), Collect the precipitate by filtration or decant the liquid carefully, Heat the acid solid gently to 100-120¬∞C for 30 minutes to decarboxylate (this will release CO2 and form the Œ≤-keto acid).

# Step 4:

Dissolve the Œ≤-keto acid from step 3 in about 50 mL ethanol, Add 5 g ammonium acetate (NH4OAc), Heat under reflux on your hotplate stirrer (around 80¬∞C) for 6-8 hours with stirring, Cool the reaction mixture. The product should precipitate out or can be extracted with an organic solvent like ethyl acetate, Filter, wash, and dry the product.

# You should have 3,3-Diethyl-2,4-Dioxopiperidine.

# 

# Methylpentynol synthesis write up

Whats needed;

1-Butyne, Acetone, Potassium tert-butoxide, Anhydrous Ethanol or THF, Distilled water + 5% HCl, MgSO‚ÇÑ or Na‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ

# Step 1

Place a clean 100 mL round-bottom flask on a magnetic stirrer, Add a magnetic stir bar into the flask, Pour in 30 mL of anhydrous ethanol (or THF if available) as solvent, (Optional) Place the flask in an ice bath if you're concerned about gas evolution.

# Step 2:

1. Add 1-butyne (\~0.7 mL) to the solvent in the flask using a pipette or syringe, Slowly add 1.12 g of potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in small portions while stirring, Do this slowly to avoid excessive bubbling (H‚ÇÇ gas is released), You should see bubbling ‚Äî this is a sign the acetylide is forming.

# Step 3

After 10‚Äì15 minutes of stirring (make sure bubbling has slowed), add acetone (\~0.58 mL) slowly using a dropper or syringe, Stir the mixture at room temperature or gently heat to 40‚Äì50¬∞C using a hot plate for 2 hours.

# Step 4:

Let the mixture cool if heated, Slowly add 20 mL of distilled water to quench the reaction, Add \~5 mL of 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl) to neutralize the basic mixture and protonate the alkoxide to form the alcohol, You should see two layers forming.

# Step 5

If you have ether or hexane: Add \~20 mL of ether or hexane to the flask, Transfer everything into a separatory funnel, shake gently, and allow the layers to separate, Collect the organic (top) laye**r**, which contains your product, Dry this layer over MgSO‚ÇÑ (just a pinch, swirl it), Filter or decant the dried solution into a clean container, Evaporate the solvent using the hot plate on low heat or in a fume hood.

If you don‚Äôt have ether\*\*:\*\* Let the reaction sit, Skim off the top organic layer with a pipette or decant carefully, Dry it manually (e.g. paper towel wick), though this is less precise

Step 6

The final product, 3-methyl-1-pentyn-3-ol, is a colorless to slightly yellow liquid\*\*,\*\* You can confirm purity by smell (sweetish alcohol-like) and optional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) if available.

# Pyrithyldione synthesis write up

Whats needed;

ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl ketone, Ammonium acetate, ethanol

# 1.

To a clean beaker or flask, add; 10 mL ethyl acetoacetate\*\*,\*\* 4.5 mL diethyl ketone, 5 g ammonium acetate, 30 mL ethanol, Add a magnetic stir bar.

# 2.

Place the flask on the magnetic stir hotplate, Stir the mixture and heat to 70‚Äì80¬∞C (gentle reflux), Keep stirring and heating for 6 hours, You may see the solution become darker or thicker.

# 3.

After 6 hours, remove from heat, Allow it to cool to room temperature, then optionally chill in an ice bath, A solid should begin to form ‚Äî this is your product.

# 4.

Filter the mixture through filter paper or a coffee filter, Wash the solid with a little cold ethanol, Let it dry in open air or in a warm place.

# Methyprylon synthesis write up

whats needed;

Acetylacetone (2,4-pentanedione), Diethyl bromide (or ethyl bromide), Methylamine solution (40% aqueous),Potassium carbonate (K2CO3), Ethanol (95%), Water

# Step 1:

Add 5 g acetylacetone (\~0.05 mol) to a 100 mL beaker, Add 30 mL ethanol and stir with the magnetic stirrer to dissolve acetylacetone, Add 10 g potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as a base to deprotonate acetylacetone. Stir well, Add 8 mL ethyl bromide dropwise (slowly, to control reaction heat), Stir the mixture at 50¬∞C on the hotplate for 6 hours. This allows alkylation at the active methylene carbon (C-3), After completion, cool the mixture and filter to remove solids (KBr salt and excess K2CO3), Evaporate the ethanol under reduced pressure or let stand overnight for the product to precipitate.

# Step 2:

Dissolve the crude product from Step 1 in 20 mL ethanol in a beaker, Add 10 mL 40% aqueous methylamine solution slowly while stirring at room temperature, Stir the mixture on the hotplate at 40¬∞C for 4‚Äì5 hours to promote ring closure (cyclization), After the reaction time, cool the mixture to room temperature or ice bath to precipitate the product, Filter the solid product and wash with cold water, Dry the product in air.

# Step 1:

place a magnetic stir bar into a 250 mL beaker or flask, Add the following into the flask: 3 mL ethyl acetoacetate, 1.4 g phenylacetic acid, 1.2 g ammonium acetate, 10 mL glacial acetic acid, Put the flask on the hotplate with stirring turned on (medium speed).

# Step 2:

slowly heat the mixture to about 110‚Äì120¬∞C (just below boiling of acetic acid You can monitor this with a thermometer. The solution will become more uniform and may thicken slightly, Keep stirring and heating for 6 hours, If you see crystals forming early, don't worry‚Äîthat's normal, Make sure not to overheat or let the solvent evaporate too much.

# Step 3:

After heating, remove from the hotplate and let the flask cool down for 15 minutes, Prepare a beaker with about 100 mL cold water + ice, Slowly pour the warm reaction mixture into the ice water while stirring gently, A white or off-white solid should form immediately, Stir it for another 15 minutes in the ice bath to let it settle.

# Step 4:

Use a funnel and filter paper to filter out the solid (gravity or vacuum filtration), Wash the collected solid with cold distilled water 3 times to remove acetic acid and byproducts.

# Step 5:

Dissolve the crude product in hot ethanol or isopropanol (20 mL)Heat until it fully dissolves, then let it cool slowly to room temperature, Place in the freezer or ice bath to form clean crystals, Filter again and dry the final product in a warm place (under 50¬∞C).

When will they just leave us alone?

I dream of not having to talk to him anymore. And no matter how much I ignore him, stop contacting him (and believe me, it‚Äôs not forced, quite the opposite), he always ends up coming back to talk to me as if nothing ever happened, as if I never broke up, as if I‚Äôm doomed to endlessly relive the same day and he‚Äôll be there until my fucking DEATH, like a parasite.

I‚Äôve said more than once that I want nothing to do with him anymore, and he acts like I never said a thing. He plays the victim and then turns violent. It‚Äôs like having to break up over and over and over again.

You‚Äôll tell me, ‚ÄúJust block him.‚Äù

Yes. And you‚Äôd be right. Except I‚Äôm not dealing with someone who‚Äôs just troubled. I‚Äôm dealing with someone who doesn‚Äôt give a damn about the law and isn‚Äôt afraid of it. Someone who talks several times a day about revenge, who‚Äôs extremely violent, who looked me straight in the eyes and told me he could destroy my life and push me to suicide, police or no police. He took the time to document everything about my life, and the lives of the people close to me.

How stupid was I to open up to him.

So what the hell am I supposed to do?

I live in fear of moving. I live locked up like a dog, and I panic if I hear a fly buzzing.

I‚Äôve at least informed the police. I have professionals around me, and I‚Äôve told them everything: the thefts, the rapes, the blackmail, the violence, the insanity. But I asked them not to take action because I‚Äôm terrified of what comes next. I don‚Äôt even trust the justice system. Is that pathetic?

I know he‚Äôd manipulate his way out, get released, and take revenge. He thrives on that. He lives for war. It‚Äôs his addiction.

He‚Äôs often told me he‚Äôs going to kill himself.

You know what?

I think maybe that‚Äôs the solution.

This guy has done things so vile, and the worst part is, he makes his victims carry the weight of it.

Guys, when I see some people saying they miss people like that, I swear, stop that shit.

All I want is for him to leave me the hell alone. I want peace. I will never, ever miss him.

I just want to see the sky, nature, drink a coffee on a terrace, walk without constantly looking over my shoulder, enjoy having legs and arms and eyes, even if my brain is in pieces. I‚Äôve become so stupid because of him.

I can‚Äôt think anymore, my memory‚Äôs shot, I live in constant stress, I replay scenes over and over in my head.

Am I the only one who‚Äôs ever dealt with someone this dangerous?

Is it because he‚Äôs a man?

Sorry for vomiting all this here. I feel like I‚Äôm becoming like him, always complaining, always whining.

I‚Äôve become a wreck, guys.

I live in a so-called ""luxury"" building, which basically is a property management company managed apartment complex with on-site maintenance, some basic amenities (gym, free coffee, a community room, etc.). In January of this year, my building's elevator stopped working and it has been down ever since. The leasing office at first sent a few emails notifying tenants that the elevator was ""temporarily out of order"". But later on in April, after multiple requests from tenants, they emailed tenants saying that the elevator cannot be repaired and therefore needs to be completely removed and a new one has to be installed. In May they gave an ETA of end of August for the new elevator to be up and running. 

My building have several wings. The wing that I live in has 6 floors with the laundry room on the basement floor. There's a working elevator located in the adjacent wing, but that elevator only goes to floor 1-4, and it can't reach the basement laundry room. In April, the leasing office bought 1 camping wagon cart thing and put it in the community room and said tenants can use that to transport stuff to their floors. 

I want to know if as a tenant I can sue my building and ask for a certain percentage of my rent to be returned? Many of my fellow tenants have also expressed their frustration with the property management company and this entire elevator repair nonsense. Not once had the leasing office mentioned any monetary compensation to all the units/tenants affected.

Genre: Romantic Drama / Adventure

Tone: Sultry, heartfelt, with a mix of playful chemistry and intense emotional stakes

Setting: A blend of a charming small town and glamorous locales (private villas, coastal estates, city penthouses)

Core Conflict: Her untamed spirit clashes with his controlled, high-stakes world, their electric connection threatening to upend their lives.

Characters

‚Ä¢  Jasper Kane: 28, a billionaire tech visionary, 6‚Äô2‚Äù with a commanding presence and sharp, dark eyes. His polished charm hides a disciplined intensity, honed by years of running an empire. Beneath his confident exterior, he‚Äôs lonely, craving a connection that challenges his carefully curated life.

‚Ä¢  Lila Monroe: Early 20s, a vibrant, quick-witted woman with a magnetic spark. Her background and inner struggles are yours to shape, maybe a small town dreamer, a city girl with hidden depths, or something unique. Lila‚Äôs bold energy and restless spirit draw people in, but there‚Äôs a fire in her that‚Äôs waiting for the right moment to blaze.

Plot Outline

Act 1: The Spark
Jasper, escaping his high pressure world, lands in a quaint small town, maybe a coastal village or a Midwest haven. Lila‚Äôs working at a cozy spot, like a bookstore or caf√©, her warmth and sharp humor catching his eye. Their meeting is electric: a spilled coffee, a lingering glance, or a rainy day that pulls them together. Over dinner at a local diner, Lila‚Äôs fearless wit unsettles Jasper‚Äôs usual control. A fleeting touch, like her hand brushing his, ignites something undeniable. When she invites him in after a drive home, their first kiss is a spark that promises a wildfire, leaving Jasper hooked and Lila shaken by her own intensity.

Act 2: The Flame

Jasper invites Lila to his world, a weekend at a stunning villa in Santorini or a sleek city penthouse (your choice). Lila, torn between her roots and this new adventure, says yes. Their chemistry deepens in lush settings: a candlelit dinner by the sea, a dance under city lights, or a quiet moment in a sprawling estate. Lila‚Äôs vibrant energy pushes Jasper to let go, while he shows her a world of possibility. Between stolen glances and heartfelt talks, they share vulnerabilities, her fears of losing herself, his struggle with isolation. Their connection grows, but so does the tension of their different worlds.

Act 3: The Reckoning

Back in Jasper‚Äôs fast paced life (New York, London, or your pick), their bond strains under external pressures. Lila‚Äôs fearless spirit feels like too much for his structured world; Jasper‚Äôs empire demands focus, and doubts creep in. A heated argument sends Lila running, scared she‚Äôs disrupted his life. Jasper chases her, maybe to her hometown or a quiet retreat, confessing she‚Äôs awakened something real in him. They reconcile in a simple setting, a cabin, her old apartment, finding balance between passion and stability. Their story ends with a playful, hopeful moment, building a life that blends their worlds.

About Me

Hey, I‚Äôm the writer behind Jasper, excited to craft a story that‚Äôs equal parts heart-pounding and heartfelt. I love vivid, sensory details, think warm summer breezes or the hum of a bustling city, that make every scene pop. My style mixes sharp banter, emotional depth, and chemistry that crackles. I‚Äôll play Jasper as a charismatic, driven man who‚Äôs unraveling for the right person. I‚Äôm thrilled for you to shape Lila, her past, her dreams, her fire, while keeping her bold and vibrant. Let‚Äôs create a rollercoaster of romance and drama, with characters who challenge and complete each other. I prefer plotting via private messages here first, then moving to another platform for writing if we click. Drop me a chat or DM to start building this world together!

1ltjq40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ltjq40/all_the_way_to_nineveh_part_16/,All the Way to Nineveh (Part 1/6),"     When you shoot up heroin, you lay on your side, never your back. This way, if you vomit in your sleep, you won't choke.
     My mother graduated rehab when I was five. She gained custody of me a year later. My dad didn't fight her in court, and I was glad. I didn't hate my father. He wasn't abusive or anything like that, we just never really got along the way most sons and fathers do. It seemed like he was always somewhere else. His life was a simple routine. Go to work, come home, cook dinner for us, then take his plate and bottle of budweiser to his room and to watch TV.
     My mom, despite her addiction, was different. I was the center of her world, and she always made sure I knew. So when my dad told me I'd be moving back in with her, I was thrilled.
     We had a small, two bedroom apartment in New Jersey. The routine was different there. Each morning, my mom would wake me up and make breakfast. She'd drive me to school on her way to work, which was a nice change as I no longer had to take the bus. 
     A couple months after she got me back, she bought a rabbit. Apparently, she'd seen a bunch of videos of bunnies and started to obsess over it. Looking back, it makes sense. When an addict quits heroin, it becomes much harder for the brain to produce serotonin naturally. Having something cute to take care of filled that gap. At least for a little while. 
     She named the rabbit Virgil.
     My mom was glued to that rabbit. She never kept him in a cage unless she was at work. Whenever we took road trips, we'd take him with. Whenever we'd eat dinner, she'd leave a plate of lettuce under the table so we could all eat together. For all intents and purposes, he was a member of our family.
     She stayed clean for another year. Then she met Mark.
     Mark was a waiter at the restaurant my mom worked at. He seemed alright at first. He never gave me a reason to dislike him, but he never really gave me a reason to like him either. He mostly ignored me whenever he came over, just hung out with my mom and watched TV. It wasn't long before he moved in with us. 
     Mark would fall asleep a lot, often in the middle of conversations. Sometimes he'd nod out while standing up. It was weird, but I was 6 so I didn't think too much about it. At least until my mom started doing it too. 
     The routine changed again. Soon, I was getting up alone in the mornings and taking the bus, like before. Mom would forget to feed Virgil a lot, so I became his sole caretaker, leaving him a plate of lettuce in the mornings before school and a plate at night. Sometimes I'd find burnt spoons in her room. Sometimes there'd be something blue in it. It was a pretty blue, like the blue markings on the backs of those poisonous frogs they find in the rainforest. Like the blue face of an asphyxiated body. 
      She'd didn't talk a lot in those last couple months. The silence was strange for a house that used to be full of her laughter. It was stranger when she did talk.
      She'd say my name sometimes, but she'd be looking in the other direction, staring into space. ‚ÄúJonah,‚Äù she'd say. ‚ÄúYou made it. I missed you so much.‚Äù 
      ‚ÄúVirgil's going down,‚Äù I remember her saying once. She was standing in the kitchen, stirring an empty pot she'd forgotten to put water in. ‚ÄúDown, down, down. All the way to Ninevah.‚Äù She smiled and turned to me, her eyes barely open. ‚ÄúWe're gonna meet him there. Just you and me kid. You and me against the world.‚Äù
     After a couple months of this, Mark suddenly disappeared. Apparently, the cash my mom pulled out for rent at the end of the month disappeared too. My mom lost her shit.
     My mom walked through the kitchen and everything in her path was broken to pieces. Glasses and plates were shattered against the wall, pots thrown to the floor. She only stopped when I started to cry.
     In an instant the rage was gone and she was swooping her arms around me and holding me. Sweat and tears poured down her face as I sobbed into her shoulder. We stayed like that for a while, her saying ‚Äúsorry‚Äù after ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and me saying ‚Äúit's okay‚Äù and her saying ‚Äúit's not okay, I'm sorry‚Äù again.
     ‚ÄúWe're gonna be alright,‚Äù she said as Virgil hopped around the broken shards of glass in the kitchen. ‚ÄúYou and me against the world, kid.‚Äù
     She cleaned up the mess and we went back to the routine. 

     A week later I woke up to her standing in the doorway of my bedroom. All the lights were out in the house, aside from my night light- a little globe with a lens that projected an array of constellations onto the wall. I don't know how long she had been standing there, or how long she'd been talking, but I remember the way she looked, her eyes drifting into space.
     ‚ÄúThen you should go,‚Äù she said as Orion's Belt drifted across her face, stained blue by the light. His arrow pointed to the right wall of the room. ‚ÄúGo, love.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I said.
     Her eyes drifted down to me, and she smiled.
     ‚ÄúIt always ends right here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen it starts all over again. All over again. It's a skipping record.‚Äù Her eyes watered. ‚ÄúI'm so happy it ends here‚Ä¶here‚Ä¶.with you.‚Äù
     She took a seat on the end of my bed.
     ‚ÄúIt starts with you and it ends with you.‚Äù
     She was silent for a while, staring at me and smiling. Eventually, she wiped her tears and stood up, leaning down to kiss my forehead.
     ‚ÄúGoodnight love, I'll see you when you get up.‚Äù
     
     The next morning, I found her there in her bed, her face blue, a trickle of vomit leaking from her mouth in the early light. The needle was still in her arm. She'd fallen asleep on her back.

     I moved back in with my dad after the funeral. The long trip north was silent. It was always silent with my dad but it was heavier now. Looking back, I think he just didn't know what to even say.
     In the time since I'd last seen him, he'd moved up to Maine to be closer to his family. It was snowing when we passed Bangor, the temperature somewhere in the negatives. The snow blew across the road in this wispy, spiritual way, like sand across a desert. The dead trees and barren farmland appeared like an alien landscape in the dark, lit by the harsh, sterile, white lights of the highway. Even with the heat in my dad's beat up old truck on at full blast, we could still see our breath in the air.
     We finally arrived at the house sometime after 12 AM. My father's home was a small ossuary, barely standing over the snow blanketed oasis that stretched outward in every direction. He had no neighbors, with the exception of an even smaller house that sat across the street.
     We got inside and my dad laid out the ground rules.
     ‚ÄúFirstly, the thermostat doesn't change,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe gas for the heater comes once a month and I can barely afford that as is. Secondly, no grease can go down the drain. None. If you make soup, dump the broth outside. Otherwise, the pipes will freeze and burst.‚Äù He scratched the back of his neck. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶Thirdly‚Ä¶no parties, alright?‚Äù
     Six year old me nodded in agreement, holding Virgil to my chest.
     ‚ÄúAlright. Good talk. Bed's in there,‚Äù he said, pointing to my new bedroom. ‚ÄúLove you kid, goodnight.‚Äù

    Virgil went missing a week later, while I was at school. I asked my dad where he went. He replied ‚ÄúWhose Virgil?‚Äù
     I left food out for him around the house and out on the back porch in hopes he would show. I did this for about a week. At some point, I stopped thinking about him as much. Eventually I forgot him entirely. 
     
     I met Billie when I was fifteen. 
     I didn't have a lot of friends in school. Other than a few kids I hung out with at lunch, the only real friend I had was Lee.
     His full name was Ulysses Dubois. Kids used to make fun of how unusual his name was. A few teachers would crack an occasional joke about it too, more in good fun than outright mocking him. He never really minded it, but his parents hated it. 
     His name had come from a species of butterfly. His mother had told me the story enough times that I could probably tell it for her. The night before Lee was born, she'd dreamt a large, fluorescent butterfly with blue and black wings had landed on her hand. The moment it touched her skin she awoke to contractions.
     It wouldn't be a stretch to say Lee had helicopter parents. His father was a pastor at the local Pentecostal church and his mother was a substitute teacher, and as such he wasn't allowed to do a lot of things when he was a kid. He couldn't play games that weren't rated E10+, even after middle school. Pok√©mon was off the table as they considered it satanic. He‚Äôd never celebrated Halloween. He didn't get a phone until he was 14 and his parents had installed one of those phone tracking apps on it so they knew where he was at all times. 
     Suffice to say, when his mother, who'd been substituting for the neighboring class, overheard his new English teacher say gesundheit after reading his name during rolecall, she didn't take it well.
     We were on the bus that day. Lee's mother had told him she was pulling him out of public school. Neither of us lived within walking distance and neither of us could drive, so we knew we weren't going to be seeing each other too much anymore. Of course neither of us said this out loud. Instead we pitched ideas for band names.
     ‚ÄúWhat about Institution Solution?‚Äù I suggested.
     ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù Lee replied.
     I shrugged.
     ‚ÄúI don't know, thought it sounded cool.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he agreed. ‚ÄúBut what if we make it really big and someone asks us what it means? Then it's like one of those tattoos of Japanese letters people get where they think it says some stupid shit like ‚ÄòDragon‚Äô or ‚ÄòWarrior‚Äô but it actually just says ‚ÄòPenis.‚Äô‚Äù
     I laughed. 
     ‚ÄúWell, do you have something better?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúPenis Dragon Warrior?‚Äù he replied
     ‚ÄúThat could work,‚Äù I chuckled. I thought about it for a minute. ‚ÄúWhat about Nineveh?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Lee replied.
     ‚ÄúNineveh?‚Äù
     Lee had a weird look on his face.
     ‚ÄúWhy would we call it Nineveh?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I began, trying to think of a reason besides my mother. It had been nine years and one month to the day. ‚ÄúI mean it's three syllables, easy to remember.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúIs it cause your name is Jonah?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù
     My house appeared from the abyss of snow outside the window. My home always reminded me of a corpse, bleak and colorless, like an animal that starved to death in the winter.
     I gathered my things together as the bus slowed to a stop. The girl across the aisle from me did the same. 
     ‚ÄúI'll see you, Lee,‚Äù I said as I stood up. Lee nodded. He had a distant look in his eyes.
     The other girl and I stepped off the bus. As she crossed the street to her house, I opened my mailbox and pulled out the letters and bills that had collected since my father left for work last Monday. Working as a cross-country truck driver meant he was rarely home.
     ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù a voice called from behind me. I turned and saw the girl across the street, standing on her porch. ‚ÄúYou smoke pot?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I replied.
     I'd never smoked pot in my life.
    ‚ÄúWanna smoke a joint?‚Äù She asked.
     I would later learn her real name was Alice Lillian Wright, named after her mother. However, much to her mother's chagrin, she went by Billie instead. She'd moved into the house across the street about a year ago. I'd seen her around a lot, walking the halls at school and of course on the bus and at our stop. She was usually on her own, aside from the occasional pot dealer or goth kid. In the summer, sometimes I‚Äôd see her practice skateboard tricks in her driveway. Despite all the time we'd spent near each other we'd never talked, other than the one morning she said ‚ÄúBless you,‚Äù after I sneezed while waiting for the bus.  
     In the winter, everything is silent. Silent enough that you can probably hear someone cough a mile away. Silent enough that I could hear every time Billie and her mother or step-dad would break into screaming matches. A lot of times she'd show up to school with unexplained bruises. Other kids talked about her sometimes. They'd say her mother was addicted to meth, that her real dad was in jail. She skipped school a lot and she'd gotten suspended three times since she started there, once for getting in a fight with a girl who called her a ‚Äúlesbo,‚Äù once for getting caught with cigarettes, and once for telling Mrs. Haley to go fuck herself after she kept calling her Alice. 
     But as we sat in her bedroom, she said nothing of any of this. She said nothing at all. Instead, she just concentrated on rolling her joint in front of her dresser. 
     I looked around her room, reading the band posters on her walls. Nirvana, Slipknot, Fugazi, Bauhaus, Radiohead.
     ‚ÄúHoly shit, you like Tram?‚Äù I said, a bit too excitedly.
     ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she replied, running her hand through her short, bleached hair. ‚ÄúThey're not bad.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI swear you're the first person I've met that's even heard of them.‚Äù
     She kept working on the joint in silence, and I worried I'd already been too much.
     ‚ÄúI like their song ‚ÄòNothing Left to Say,‚Äô‚Äù she added after a while. She finished the joint and lit it. Taking a couple puffs before turning her chair to face me and passing it.
     I looked at the joint for a moment, pinched between my thumb and pointer. The smell was strong and kind of gross. Something about the way I was holding it or the way I was looking at it must have tipped her off because she stopped me before I tried to smoke it.
     ‚ÄúYou know you don't have to if you don't want to,‚Äù she said.
     ‚ÄúYeah, I know.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúNo, seriously,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúDon't be a hero. I'd feel bad if you freaked out.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI won't freak out,‚Äù I said as confidently as I could. ‚ÄúIt smells good.‚Äù
     I took a puff and held it a moment, before breaking into a hacking fit. Billie giggled, and carefully grabbed the joint from my hand before I could drop it.
     ‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said once I could breathe again. ‚ÄúYou never smoked before, did you?‚Äù
     I shook my head.
    ‚ÄúThen that's all you're getting. I don't want you to green out,‚Äù she replied as she took a hit. I didn't fight her on it‚Ä¶
    
     ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Billie said.
     I glanced up to her from the floor. 
     ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I replied.
     ‚ÄúThe floor is real fascinating, isn't it?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúDude,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúYou've been staring at the floor for like five minutes!‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI was staring at the floor?‚Äù
     Billie cackled and I started laughing too. My whole body felt as though I'd been wrapped in a warm blanket. My eyes were heavy and my tongue was dry. My skin was buzzing‚Ä¶

     ‚Äú...Ninevah?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I replied.
     ‚ÄúWhy'd you want to call your band Ninevah?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúHow did you know about my band?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶the bus‚Ä¶I sit right next to you.‚Äù‚Äù
     ‚ÄúOh yeah,‚Äù I replied.
     ‚ÄúSo is it really just because your name's Jonah?‚Äù
     I shrugged‚Ä¶

     ‚Ä¶Nothing Left to Say, by Tram, was playing through Billie's Bluetooth speaker. I was laying on the floor on my side. At some point I'd crammed myself somewhat into the crevice between the bed and the nightstand. Billie was laying on the floor across the room, on her back, staring at the ceiling. 
     ‚ÄúI never appreciated how fucking good this song is,‚Äù I said.
     ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYeah man.‚Äù I rubbed my eyes. ‚ÄúWhat even is music?‚Äù I asked after a while.
     ‚ÄúOh God.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúNo, seriously. Like it's just sounds‚Ä¶but they're ordered by like‚Ä¶equal increments of time. And like‚Ä¶only certain sounds work together in certain intervals‚Ä¶and it all somehow means something? I mean how do we even know how to keep rhythm? How can we measure time like instinctually?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you on about, man?‚Äù Billie laughed.
     ‚ÄúI don't know. Like isn't time relative? Or a cube or something?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúA cube?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYeah, I think some scientist said it's a cube.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúOkay?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúBut if it's a cube, and not like a line, then why do we see it as a line? And how do we measure that and like use it to make music? Like did we make it all up?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúMake up what?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúDid we make up time?‚Äù I asked.
     ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, we made up time.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWeird man,‚Äù I said. I grew silent for a while. ‚ÄúIt always ends right here,‚Äù I said. Then I started to cry. 
      At the time, I didn't understand why. I never cried easily- in fact I couldn't remember the last time I had- but there I was in my neighbors bedroom, sobbing like a baby. 
     ‚ÄúYo man, you okay?‚Äù Billie asked, sitting up. My face grew red and I tried to stop the tears and wipe them off, but I couldn't.
     Billie scooted across the room and sat next to me.
     ‚ÄúYou want to talk about it?‚Äù she asked quietly. I shook my head. ‚ÄúOkay. Well I'm still here.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù I said. 
     ‚ÄúDon't be,‚Äù she replied‚Ä¶

     ‚Äú...So then my dad gets out of rehab, right?‚Äù Billie continued. We were sitting next to each other now, our backs against the wall. ‚ÄúI think ‚ÄòFuck yeah! Mom doesn't want me anyway. I can go live with dad!‚Äô Then I find out he met someone there, some bitch named Theresa. Once they both got out, they moved in together, got married. Now they have some shitty cul-de-sac house in Massachusetts so he can play step-dad to her kids.‚Äù She turned to look at me. I never noticed that her eyes were grey. ‚ÄúI have two step-brothers and a sister, never met any of them. Can't even remember their names. He sends me pictures sometimes but I just throw them out.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYou've never gone to his house?‚Äù I asked.
     ‚ÄúI never got invited.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat an asshole,‚Äù I said.
     Billie shook her head.
     ‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúI still miss him. They say that addicts can't be around things that remind them of the drug, and I wasn't an easy kid. I acted out a lot. Maybe he just-‚Äù
     Billie trailed off.
     ‚ÄúThat's not your fault. Fuck him,‚Äù I said.
     ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she agreed. ‚ÄúFuck him.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúMy dad would probably forget I existed if I didn't live with him. He acts as if he doesn't know he's my dad or something. It's like he's just this roommate I only see once every two weeks.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúThat sucks,‚Äù Billie replied. ‚ÄúWhat's your mom like?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúShe was nice. Funny too. Really funny,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúShe died when I was six. Overdose.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Billie said quietly. ‚ÄúWell, aren't we a pair.‚Äù
     I chuckled. 
     The moment was interrupted by the jingle of keys and the sound of the front door opening.
     ‚ÄúDammit,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúShe's not supposed to be home til eight.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúIs she gonna be mad I'm here?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúNo, you're fine,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúI'll deal with it.‚Äù
     A moment later, the bedroom door swung open and her mother's face appeared, wide eyed and angry. She was still dressed in her work clothes, her black and grey hair tied back under her McDonald's cap. She glared at Billie, glanced over to me, then back to Billie.
     ‚ÄúWho the fuck is this?‚Äù she demanded, gesturing to me. 
     ‚ÄúMy friend,‚Äù Billie replied.
     ‚ÄúI'm Jonah,‚Äù I said awkwardly. Mrs. Wright ignored me. 
     ‚ÄúIt smells like pot in here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou stealing my shit again?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI got it from Darryl,‚Äù Billie replied. ‚ÄúAnd I never stole your pot. Your boyfriend probably took it.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWatch your tone when you're talking to me,‚Äù her mother warned, pointing a finger at her. ‚ÄúAnd my husband didn't take shit.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI said okay.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúThat's not what I heard.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWell, that's what I said.‚Äù
     Her mother's lip curled into a sneer. 
     ‚ÄúYou know I'm getting real tired of this Alice. The lying. The fucking attitude. My shit disappearing.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI didn't steal your fucking pot!‚Äù Billie screamed. ‚ÄúYour shit disappears because your high all the time and your husband is a fucking crackhead!‚Äù
     ‚ÄúDon't you raise your voice at me, bitch! I'm your mother!‚Äù she shouted back. 
     ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my room!‚Äù
     ‚ÄúIf I knew that this was where my life would end up‚Ä¶‚Äù
     ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my room!
     ‚Äú...I would have never had you!‚Äù
     ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my room!‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhy couldn't you have been a son?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù 
     Her mother slammed the door and stormed down the hall. Billie was silent for a long time.
     ‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù she said at last. ‚ÄúYou should probably leave.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúAre you gonna be okay?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYeah. I'll be alright.‚Äù

     I found Virgil when I was sixteen.
     I was hotboxing my room that night, laying in my room and listening to music. My dad had just left earlier in the day and wouldn't be back for two weeks so I figured it was the perfect time to smoke a joint. I still remember the song I was listening to. Since I Was Six, by The Brian Jonestown Massacre.
     ‚ÄúAnd someday you'll see me
      How I always saw us
     And someday we'll find it
     There in Nineveh""
     I read the poem I'd written for Billie again, thinking I was some kind of lyrical genius. I don't think I ever planned on actually reading it to her, but some part of me had to write it down, and I figured if every band name had to have some kind of meaning, I could just turn it into a song. Of course, I still had to buy a guitar. 
     Billie and I had gotten close in that last year since we met. We were hanging out almost everyday, smoking pot and talking shit about kids at school. Even on days we didn't hang out, we'd stay up late talking on the phone, sometimes falling asleep on the line. We had a collaborative playlist and any time we found a new song we like, we'd add it. I liked her taste in music. It seemed like every song she added became one of my favorites. 
     It's weird falling in love with your best friend. When it came to Billie, I was stuck between two opposite and equally true beliefs: either she felt the same way about me that I felt about her, or there was no world she even thought of me as an option. That feeling is called cognitive dissonance. I'd just learned the phrase in Psychology I. I think I pitched it as a band name once. I folded up the piece of paper and left it on the nightstand. 
     A rustling came from the closet.
     I glanced over and nearly shit a brick as I laid my eyes upon it. It was a little white rabbit, sitting on his haunches and sniffing the air, his nose twitching.
     It had been ten years since Virgil disappeared, and in that time I had somehow forgotten I'd ever even had a rabbit. It took me a moment to recognize him, and when I did I was far more confused than I had already been. 
     ‚ÄúVirgil?‚Äù
     The rabbit twitched his head to the sound of my voice, then hopped back into the closet, disappearing behind the corner of the wall. I climbed out of bed, swiftly dropped the joint in the ashtray I'd grabbed from my dad's room, and walked over to the closet, ducking down and crawling underneath the coats and shirts hanging from the rack. It was too dark to see him, so I felt around with my hand, hoping to find the soft fur of Virgil's back. I found nothing, other than the carpet. What was strange, was that I should've felt the left hand wall of the closet.
     I crawled deeper, dipping behind the wall Virgil had hidden behind. I'd gone three feet, then four, then five. I knew it was impossible. I knew where my closet ended. Yet I kept going, feeling the bottom of my clothes brush across my back. Six feet. Seven feet. Eight feet. The deeper I crawled, the less I questioned what was happening. Nine feet. Ten feet. The clothes no longer smelled like my laundry detergent. Now they smelled old, like moth balls. Eleven feet. Twelve feet. I could see light now, dim at first, then brighter. Thirteen feet. Fourteen feet. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. 
     I crawled out of the closet. I was in a new room now. It looked to be a living room, with a couch and a coffee table. The walls here were all white, with no windows. The light I'd seen had come from a lamp on an end table. I should have been afraid, or at the very least confused, but all I could think about was how nice the light looked, warm like a sunset, washing over the walls and furniture and casting long shadows across the shag carpet. Virgil was waiting for me there, sitting in the middle of the floor. 
     I couldn't name the way I felt in that moment. It was like being six, and waking up in the back of my mom's car late at night to see my house out the window. It was like coming home. 

     I never told my father about the closet. I knew he wouldn't believe it, and I didn't want him to know anyway. It was my secret, a place to go when the outside world was too much. I didn't even tell Billie. It felt irresponsible somehow.
     There were other rooms beyond the living room. The first room had three doors. One lead to a kitchen, another to a bedroom with a queen sized mattress. The third lead to a hallway.
     The hallway had four rooms of its own. One, of course, was the living room. Then, on the opposite wall was a door leading to a small library, complete with bookshelves on each wall and a desk in the middle. This second house even had a bathroom at the right end of the hallway. 
     The last room was the strangest. 
     It was completely empty, other than a large, circular table in the center, and a bright red door on the opposite wall. I'd tried to open it a few times, but it was locked. 
     The last room always gave me a weird feeling when I'd walk in there. My hair would raise from my neck. Despite the fact that (like every other room) there were no windows, I always felt like I was being watched. 
     It wasn't long before I was spending every day after school there. It was easier. I never thought about the problems in my life, my dad, my mom's death. It was my little paradise. Anytime I had a bad day at school or I started to think about things too much, I could just crawl back into the closet and Virgil would be waiting for me.
     Time was different there too. The first night, I spent an hour there. When I finally came back, my joint was still burning in the ashtray, with half of it left to smoke. Sometimes I'd spend what felt like an entire day there, only to come out and realize it'd been no more than half an hour. I think I slept there a few nights. 
     Despite the way time moved differently there, I still found myself missing things in the outside world. I missed a lot of calls, mostly from Lee. I missed the bus a few mornings after going inside to say bye to Virgil, only to get distracted with a book found in the library before, or a new smell I hadn't noticed.
     No, I didn't tell Billie. Not for a month at least. Not until the night she slept over. 
     I was laying in bed when the screaming started. This was nothing new. It seemed like they were fighting every night now. Eventually, there came the crash of glass shattering and everything went silent.
     I texted Billie and asked if she was okay. She read it but never replied.
     I had trouble sleeping after that. I thought about going inside, but I wanted to be there in case something happened and Billie needed help. I'd almost managed to fall asleep after an hour or so, but I was snapped awake by a knock at the front door. 
     When I opened it, Billie was standing there. Her face was streaked with tears. Her arm was stained green and brown. As soon as she saw me she grabbed hold of me and sobbed into my shoulder.
     I‚Äôd never seen her cry before. It caught me off guard. Despite everything in her life, she'd always seemed invincible somehow. 
     ‚ÄúShe ripped them up,‚Äù she managed to say between choked breaths. ‚ÄúAll of them.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúMy pictures. The ones my dad sent.‚Äù
     I remembered when she'd said she'd thrown them out. I wondered why she had to lie about something like that.
     ‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù I replied, unsure of what to say. 
     ‚ÄúI don't want to be here anymore,‚Äù she sobbed. ‚ÄúI want it to end.‚Äù
     I knew I shouldn't have told her. I knew it was irresponsible, but I didn't know what else to do. I thought it would make her feel better, at least for a night. At that point, it all felt out of my hands.
     ‚ÄúWe don't have to be here,‚Äù I replied. She looked up from my shoulder.
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúThere's another place.‚Äù
     And before I knew it, I was showing her the closet, leading her down that narrow, dark corridor between the real world and that other, impossible place.

**SEEWALDS GRIFT A 1-DAY FAMILY CAMP SAMPLER**

Jessa‚Äôs family camp YouTube video gave me 19KAC flashbacks. It felt very much like many episodes of the show, featuring a lot of feedback from the kids (EVEN HENRY‚Ä¶TIL he plays the piano!) and dizzying camera cuts. The family hit the road about 6:30AM. Apparently ‚ÄúSeewald Time‚Äù functions better than ‚ÄúDuggar Time,‚Äù because all the kids seemed rather perky. On the way, Henry interviews his siblings to find out what they were excited to do at camp. Fern is definitely the long thinker in the family, because she skipped right over family camp to declare that she is going to be an ‚Äúartist, football girl‚Äù who is going to ‚Äúdraw a lot of football stuff‚Äù when she grows up. If it weren‚Äôt for her fundamentalist pedigree, I would say this girl was going places!¬†

I‚Äôm intrigued by this visit to the family camp, which apparently runs for 3 days (Thursday to¬† Sunday) and costs $110 per adult and $75 per kid (infants are free). But‚Ä¶at the end of the video, Jessa declares they just went ‚Äúfor the day,‚Äù because at 8 months pregnant she is gonna sleep in her own bed. I‚Äôm guessing a family tie to the Forsyths gave them an in to come for just the day. They arrived in time for breakfast, went to chapel, did archery, axe throwing, horseback riding, and zip lining, which is a full day indeed, but not worth $520 IMO.¬†

On the way home, she begs Bin to pull over because she saw a sign for soft serve ice cream. Bin was obliging. I guess he‚Äôs learned a thing or two about how to treat a pregnant mama, in spite of the stunning example of his I‚Äôll-sweep-up-crackers-but-still-make-you-crawl under-the-table deadbeat brother-in-law.¬†

**THIS WEEK ON ‚ÄúKEEPING UP WITH CARLIN‚Äù**

Joy continues to give her bestie Carlin a run for her money when it comes to slinging links. The extensive list includes bug spray, kids camping bedding, mom-friendly swimwear that makes Jill‚Äôs People Illustrated Swimsuit Edition photoshoot look conservative, a fill-in Dr. Seuss style memory book for kids, dresses, shirts, packing cubes, organizing bins, a car battery jump pack, snack containers, summer outdoor kids toys, headphones, kids sunscreen, her sunscreen, skin repair spray, mascara, a kids swim puddle jumper, and (my personal favorite) a free game app called Travel Town which she and Austin are using as a competition against each other. (Her story promoting the game came on my screen the same evening I was watching Hulu when every other ad was for Royal Kingdom, which made her perky ad seem even more annoying than it already was.)

**3 CHEERS FOR THE BURN BOOT CAMP BRIGADE!!**

Maddie and a not-visibly-pregnant Giggles and Lauren hit the 50 camp mark at Burn Boot Camp. (I was going to say ‚Äúvisibly-not-pregnant,‚Äù but with these girls anything is possible.) Lauren is seem wearing a NIKE (swoosh not included) tank top and tight legging shorts, while Kendra is still going strong with the workout skirts.¬†

I‚Äôve watched an embarrassing about of Burn Boot Camp stories this week tying to spot Dugs, and let me tell you what: that crap is INTENSE! Also, they have childcare, which means they are presumably getting a 45 minute break from their kids a few times a week. (I‚Äôm hoping this prevents any laundry room breakdowns.) In spite of Kendra‚Äôs tenacious hold on modesty standards, they don‚Äôt seem deterred (or defrauded) by all the yoga pants, flopping body parts, and midriffs of their fellow participants‚Ä¶nor convicted about the pulsing demonic workout music‚Ä¶nor bothered by the ever present cameras taking stories for the BBC IG page. (Oh wait, I forgot‚Ä¶the cameras are second nature to them!)¬†

Finally‚Ä¶some of these Dugs are going multiple times a week! OGJed & Katey get first prize for going 3 times this week (including the holiday). Maddie & Joy (and possibly Lauren) were seen twice. Kendra was seen once, and there was also a possible JD sighting. (These videos pan quickly!) So, these young parents have gained a tiny bit of respect in my book.¬†¬†

**DUGGAR IN-LAWS FINALLY LOSE BROOMBALL VIRGINITY**

On this week‚Äôs episode of the Jer & Jinge podcast, we find out that they have tripled their listeners, so miracles really do happen. We also discover that not only did they lug all their podcast gear from LA to Arkansas, they used their frequent flier miles to bring along‚Ä¶.their podcast producer! Talk about dedication. Such servant‚Äôs hearts they have.¬†

They chat all about their riveting trip to Arkansas, talking about everything from ice cream to which siblings they got to see (and which ones they didn‚Äôt). Jessa shares how hard it is to be out of the lives of her youngest siblings and ‚Äúnot know what they are into.‚Äù I suppose when you have raised a quarter of your own siblings, leaving them behind for your incompetent parents to raise has to be a shock to the system. (Felicity was also VERY confused and asked ‚ÄúLolli‚Äù where all the kids were. Johanna had to explain that they WERE the kids!) We learn that the Tinker Toy House is now the Tinker Toy Farm, and they have chickens, goats, sheep, cattle, and horses.¬†

Jer waxes vague when he says that the Duggars have had a ‚Äúrough couple of years‚Äù where people had to deal with stuff ‚Äúin their own way‚Äù but that everyone is ‚Äúin a really good place now.‚Äù I would agree, Jer. FCI Seagoville IS a good place for the sex pest.¬†

But the highlight of the snoozecast is the riveting discussion of how Bin and Jer finally lost their broomball virginity. Apparently, Jinge was the one who begged Jeer (not to be confused with Jer - they spent a solid 2 minutes on this distinction) to set up the family broomball game. Bin and Jer had never played before, so they were in for it. Bin showed up in full hockey gear complete with mask. JB can still do knee slides in his 60s. Chaos and competitiveness was had by all, and Jinger lost her voice.

‚ÄúSeason of Life‚Äù mentions in this episode: 6

**TRULY FREE! (OR IS IT?)**

Jinger keeps the hawking simple this week, with only one product‚Ä¶or brand of products. TRULY FREE. She‚Äôs switched everything in her home to the brand. Out of sheer curiosity, I decided to do a little snooping into this product. For example, if you want the TF ‚ÄúEveryday Cleaner‚Äù You can get an empty 16oz bottle and 2 3-oz ‚Äúrefills‚Äù (concentrated, you mix them with water to make the 16 oz) for the amazing price of $16.95. If you count the water you add (which you have to pay for out of your own water bill), it works out to 53 cents per oz. If you exclude the water, it works out to $2.82 per oz plus an empty spray bottle. So, while it may be toxin-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, gluten-free‚Ä¶and proceeds benefit poor orphan children in Cintrul America‚Ä¶is it really TRULY FREE?!?!?! (It doesn‚Äôt seem bullcrap-free to me.)

**VUOLOS VOLLEYING VIGNETTES**

Jinge & Jer continue to land neck and neck in their contest to see who can post the most embarrassing photo of the other. Jeremy came in clutch with 2 shots of Jinge in a sweatshirt and hat‚Ä¶one where she was giving a cringy half smile and the other that was literally completely blurry. Had these two photos not been in the same post, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell who it was in the 2nd photo. Someone needs to tell Jeremy that blurry photos are not an art form. So I give this weeks‚Äô medal to Jinger, who posted a real doozy of Jeremy in a coffee shop where he looked like he had just run a 5K. (She also gets bonus points for ACTUALLY running a 5K on the 4th.)

**FOURTH FESTIVITIES**

The family headed many directions for the 4th. Hannah and JerJed went to Nebraska. Jana and Stephen also stayed in Nebraska where they spent the day doing typical 4th things (parades, ceremonies, fireworks, more fireworks, and a reel of everything above set predictably to God Bless the USA.)¬†

Jin-Jer stayed in LA for a 5K, a parade, and a wedding that included fireworks. (They were also visited by Jeremy‚Äôs parents.)¬†

On the 2nd, Joystin attended ‚ÄúFood Trucks and Fireworks‚Äù at the Sr Duggars church (GLBC). Hannie, Jordyn, and Josie were also in attendance as part of the choir. I know this because they were wearing black shirts that read CHOIR in white letters. How creative and cute!¬†

For the 4th, OGJed & Kathy, Kendra (assuming w/ Joe & the kids), and Joystin Fam attended a true Arkansas party at Drews.gal‚Äôs house / barn / farm. There were cowboy boots and a 3 legged race. Austin brought his excavator and attached a rope to it, which was attached to an inner tube that was swung around on a makeshift slip n side. Joy appropriately captioned it ‚Äúarkansas things.‚Äù She also could have captioned it ‚ÄúDuggar Things,‚Äù because she blurred out an unnamed girl‚Äôs legs and backside when she was on the inner tube. (We sadly did not get to see Joe dry-humping Kendra on an inner tube this time. I guess after that many kids, the romance has died.)

I think it‚Äôs \*possible\* Anna and the Minions were there, because there were some little girls who looked a lot like MacKynzie looked when she was younger. There was also a little blonde girl with a heart-emoji-censored face sitting on a chair that had \*ella visibly written in Sharpie on the tag. So I‚Äôm guessing Josiah, Lauren, and the Alphabet Gang were also in attendance.¬†

While it seems like many (if not most) of the Dugs were celebrating the Arkansas way, Jase & Maddie threw a more sophisticated event, complete with handmade bunting, fake red roses, Cokes with gingham ribbons, and sparklers. It looked like there was seating for at least 30 people, but they are keeping the guest list a mystery.¬†

**#WHERESJENNI MIGHT GO VIRAL AS ‚ÄúFANS‚Äù WORRY ABOUT THE LOSTEST OF LOST GIRLS BEING MIA¬† \~The Sun, probably‚Ä¶**

Jackson, Hannie, and Jordyn were sighted the last two Sunday mornings in their church choir, and 3 of the Lost Girls were present for the Food Trucks and Fireworks event on July 2nd. Jenni has been mysteriously absent from all sightings. #wheresjenni¬†

**HOLY DISRUPTER GETS DISRUPTED**

Famy took to her stories to bemoan her son saying ‚Äúmom mom mom mom‚Äù constantly whenever he wants something. It bothered her so much she escaped to her hot car for a few minutes to record said stories. I guess disrupting is only holy when she‚Äôs the one doing the disrupting.¬†

**CLOUD ANGEL SPOTTED IN SKY. POSSIBLE LINK TO 2024 CHICKEN NUGGETS MIRACLE?**

Our last story came in at the 11th hour, and I rushed to add this before posting. Tonight Deanna posted a picture of a cloud that looks to be in the form of‚Ä¶an angel. To me, it looks like a plummeting Baymax with the wings of a dove, but you do you Deanna! Could it possibly be Daxton heading back up to heaven to visit Grandma Mary again? Or maybe the angel was returning from another AngelEats chicken nuggets delivery? The heavenly mystery deepens‚Ä¶

‚Äî

There were a few other posts that I could have included, but they were either unremarkable or unsnarkable (or both), so they didn‚Äôt make the cut.¬†

1ltjjjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ltjjjg/im_tired_of_living_in_a_house_where_everything_i/,"I‚Äôm tired of living in a house where everything I do is wrong, and my autistic brother is always excused. I need advice.","Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not against autistic people ‚Äî I just don‚Äôt like my brother.

I‚Äôm a teenage girl living with my older brother (he‚Äôs in his late 20s) and some other family members(male dominated household). I‚Äôm still studying and working part-time to pay for my own expenses because I don‚Äôt receive allowance. I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm mentally breaking down.

Since childhood, my brother would hit me during arguments. That stopped only because my dad had a talk with him, but the emotional abuse never ended. Anytime we argue ‚Äî even over small things like me asking how his day was ‚Äî he crashes out and tells me to die or kill myself. It happens every time. He once admitted to me that he says that because he knows it breaks me.

every time he is arguing He insults me for not doing well in school, tells me I don‚Äôt help the family (even though I do housework and pay for everything myself), and blames me for not supporting the household financially like he does. For context, my dad still financially supports my mom and younger sister because he wants to be a father figure ‚Äî but he‚Äôs stretched thin. Sometimes my dad asks my brother to lend money, and I think he doesn‚Äôt always  pays him back, so maybe that‚Äôs why my brother is so stingy.

Even when we had no food at home, my brother wouldn‚Äôt buy me anything unless he was told to do so from my dad or he was given money by me/my dad. On rare occasions he does,he brings it up later in arguments to make himself look good.

One of the most disgusting things he‚Äôs done: when I was around 15/16, we had a bad fight and while I was in school, he texted me calling me a sl**who sleeps with boys in my class and other sexual slurs. (I can‚Äôt say it openly coz it‚Äôs gonna get removed from Reddit)  That was absolutely not true. Idk what the hell he has been watching or thinking about for him to be talking so cheap. I cried so hard n  came home trying to defend myself, but my dad just brushed it off, saying he had already ‚Äútalked to him‚Äù and that I should move on. Everyone excused it. I was so disgusted, I couldn‚Äôt look at my brother for weeks. Eventually, I let it slide like always. End of the day idk why but no matter how horrible they treat me I still feel like I miss having a bond with them even though there is no bond lol idk what is wrong is me but I prolly have some attachment issues. He still says horrible things to me, but at least not sexual stuff anymore.

He‚Äôs manipulative too. He tells twisted stories about me to my grandpa, and then my grandpa complains about me to my dad ‚Äî which makes my dad lash out at me unfairly. One time, I made coffee for my dad before work, but he refused to bring it. Later he told me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your coffee. I can buy it anywhere. You‚Äôre poisonous, just like your mother.‚Äù That shattered me.

My grandpa is very sexist. When he needs help, even if my brother is just lying down and I‚Äôm busy, he only asks me. If I say, ‚ÄúCan you ask my brother instead?‚Äù he gets angry and says I‚Äôll never be a good family girl material. My brother just agrees with him. Saying if I don‚Äôt do this how can I be a good wife to my husband in the future like w** shut the hell up. I‚Äôm the one who cooks, cleans, and helps out, but I‚Äôm treated like trash ‚Äî like a maid with no love in return. During exam season, like they knew I was taking my finals but even then I was still expected to clean the house daily.  There was a point in my life I had high school  prom but my dad was not willing to pay for me lol. But I still wanted to experience girlhood and stuff so I started working for the first time. But then I was so overwhelmed, I got physically sick from working long shifts to afford my prom, skipping meals, and pushing myself.

I even had to go for medical tests due to how bad my health got. I paid nearly $100 for the tests out of my own salary. My dad blamed me for not taking care of myself. He didn‚Äôt even help with my prom expenses ‚Äî I paid for everything alone with my  bare minimum weekend job and a school award that provides us financial aid for studying well. That‚Äôs how I finally bought the phone I wanted too.

I‚Äôve always been treated like an outsider in my own home. The men in the house ‚Äî my dad, grandpa, and brother ‚Äî talk to each other, support one another. They only talk to me when they want something.

Today was my breaking point. I got kicked out of my room and now sleep in the living room. At 4am, my brother turned on the dining room lights to airfry some food, (he got sleeping problems he can‚Äôt sleep) even though the kitchen light was already on and enough. The light was shining directly in my face while I was trying to sleep. I signaled him to turn it off (he always understands), but he ignored me. When I finally spoke, he told me to die ‚Äî again. I started crying and couldn‚Äôt sleep after that. When I texted him asking why he‚Äôs being so inconsiderate, he said it‚Äôs because he was angry about having to hang my grandpa‚Äôs clothes.

I was at work when those clothes ran out. I‚Äôm the only girl in the house, and still I‚Äôm expected to do everything. If he helps even once, everyone praises him like a hero. I do it every day and no one notices.

Backstory (summarized):
My brother was diagnosed with autism in his teens. I was too young to understand the details, but I heard my mom (who also had autism) raised him in a very neglectful way when my dad was busy ‚Äî locking him in rooms and leaving him alone. Which is probably why he developed this condition overtime even though he was normal at first? He was bullied badly in school for being different and overweight which made him stop studying altogether. Eventually, through support, he got a decent job.

But he‚Äôs always had a bad attitude. He purposely slacked off, skipped work, and tried to get fired.  Later on we moved states. My dad helped him find a better job that was close to home, but he acted the same: rude to managers, refused to do tasks, misread social cues, and made a female coworker uncomfortable. He eventually quit without telling anyone, and now works irregular hours only when someone else is on MC. He still shows up late or skips work often.

My family members often see me crying or sometimes they see exactly what is happening to me but they choose to act blind. Even if it‚Äôs not related to home and I just cry due to my own reasons they won‚Äôt check up on me but they will be literally watching their phone right in front of me. And in that same day even tho they saw me cry I expect them to be nice so I would ask them small favours but they treat me like I was being entitled. Atp I‚Äôm just used to getting called useless and every other slurs the whole time

Despite all this, I‚Äôm always told to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù and that I‚Äôll have to take care of him when he‚Äôs older. But I don‚Äôt want to take care of someone who‚Äôs emotionally abusive, manipulative, and ungrateful.

I‚Äôm exhausted.

I hope to return the favor and enhance your life as well. I realize this might be a big request for a Reddit post, but who knows‚Äîmiracles can happen!


I am watching Scandal. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt watch it when it first aired; maybe I was busy? Anyway, I am loving binge-watching this! I‚Äôm only on episode 2, so no spoilers, please. 


I‚Äôm 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States, working across both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. My work life is quite hectic and intense, leaving little room for frivolous distractions, but I pride myself on being fair and kind.

I strive to find the good in people and trust my intuition. While I have a close-knit group of friends, many of them are married with children, which makes it challenging for us to spend time together. I completely respect their priorities, but I sense that our paths are starting to diverge. At this point, I'm not looking to connect with my married friends; instead, I'm open to forging new friendships with those who are divorced, as long as we can avoid any drama related to ex-partners‚Äîlife is simply too short for that.

I recently ended a serious engagement and came to the difficult realization that I didn‚Äôt love him enough to move forward with marriage. Making that decision was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Now, I‚Äôm taking some time for myself and focusing on building friends  only.


As an avid reader and dedicated audiobooks lover, I find great joy in diving into stories, especially while on the go. Listening to books allows me to indulge in literature conveniently, and there‚Äôs something truly enchanting about the experience of being read to! I often increase the playback speed to double time, so if you‚Äôre interested in chatting about books, I‚Äôd be thrilled to do so. Recently, I was profoundly touched by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; while it was an emotional read, it made a lasting impact on my heart and changed my perspective on important issues. That‚Äôs what I find so beautiful about books!

Music holds a special place in my life. I'm currently curating a dinner playlist that‚Äôs coming together wonderfully, featuring talents like Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I‚Äôve even created a 20-hour playlist that spans a variety of genres. Recently, I discovered the band ""The Scarlet Opera,"" and I‚Äôm really enjoying their vibe. Since I have Apple Music, I‚Äôd love to share my playlists if you‚Äôre interested!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There‚Äôs something truly magical about dressing up to witness these extraordinary performances. However, I also love TV and movies. While I enjoy the thrill of getting ready for a night out, I equally treasure the cozy comfort of wearing sweatpants and a concert t-shirt at home.

I‚Äôm passionate about dining out and exploring new restaurants. Although I do enjoy cooking at home, I‚Äôve found myself in a phase where going out for brunch and dinner with friends is my primary focus. I‚Äôm a big fan of iced coffee and love sharing plenty of champagne with great company! Food in general‚Äîespecially brunch and lunch‚Äîis one of my favorite passions!

I've had the pleasure of traveling quite extensively, from the beautiful beaches of Bali to the romantic streets of Paris and the stunning landscapes of Kenya, even covering all 50 states in the process. At this point, it feels like I've crossed off most of the destinations from my travel wishlist. However, I'm always ready to recommend some great restaurants no matter which city you mention!

I'm on the lookout for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who lives in the United States and shares my preference for voting blue. Sports and video games aren't really my thing, so if those are your main interests, we might not be a great match. Also, I'm not into hiking or camping, just to keep that in mind!",0,1751857584.0,R4R30Plus,1,0.5,False

Since she‚Äôs entering her teenage phase she‚Äôs definitely regressed and I am looking for advice on a plan I came up with! 

She is very reactive towards cars, sometimes people and other dogs so I will stick to the same potty times as we‚Äôve been doing for 8 months, but instead of walking her in the neighborhood (I live in a condo), I will be only walking her in the grassy area by my building where there is no triggers 99% of the time. She normally will not poop here, but I‚Äôm thinking if she decides to hold it, we‚Äôll go out more often and if she goes in the house, she‚Äôll go back to being restricted to a pen when i‚Äôm not watching her. 

The long walks will be supplemented with recall training, snuffle mats, kongs or puzzle toys and more playtime inside, consisting of fetch, place training, and threshold training.

She hasn‚Äôt been barking much at hallway noises, but when she does, it‚Äôs immediately redirecting or treating when she doesn‚Äôt bark.

Back to crate training, she hasn‚Äôt been destructive, not once in the last 8 months, but last night she chewed on my coffee table so it‚Äôs back to crate training instead of restricted to the living room while I‚Äôm gone. This will also go hand in hand with place training and not barking when I leave the condo. 

In the elevator she sometimes gets antsy with other people in there since the building requires us to hold our dogs and she‚Äôll bark at them. So instead we‚Äôll take the stairs and if I absolutely need the elevator I did get a muzzle, but she‚Äôs not used to it just yet.  

Is there any advice you guys can add or give me to make this a good plan? I really want to be consistent and be considerate to my neighbors. They‚Äôre all very understanding, but with my annoyance with her recently, I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty for them as well.

I‚Äôm from Europe, where BBW isn‚Äôt sold in every country, but I now have a chance to order from abroad. I don‚Äôt have a minimalist perfume collection, but I also try to avoid blind-buying things I won‚Äôt end up using, even if they‚Äôre a good deal. So far, I only own a coconut body mist from The Body Shop which I adore.

My taste:
Favorites include YSL Black Opium, Replica Coffee Break, Armani Acqua di Gioia, Novellista Citrus Affair.
I also enjoy good cheapies like Lush Dirty, Katy Perry Indie, Yves Rocher Vanilla, Zara Vanilla Bloom and Bohemian Oud, Antonio Banderas Seduction line.

I like layered, well-blended fruity or dessert gourmands (as long as they‚Äôre not too synthetic), fresh/spicy/aromatics, and even interesting clean scents.

So‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	Are there BBW mists that perfume lovers actually consider high-quality or worth it?
	‚Ä¢	Which BBW scents are the safest blind buys for someone with my taste?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any that feel like ‚Äúdupes‚Äù or cousins of the perfumes I like?
	‚Ä¢	Do they last well or are they just good for layering/around-the-house wear?

1ltj8m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1ltj8m8/different_flavors_of_the_same_thing/,Different flavors of the same thing,"I‚Äôve had two partners emotionally abuse me in the last year.

One was a covert narcissist. He was so subtle, I couldn‚Äôt even explain what he was doing to me in a way that would make sense to others as abuse. He learned my deepest vulnerabilities and would create situations to put me down and hurt my feelings, all so he could make me feel better and show how he was the good guy and I was just sensitive. Somehow I was always apologizing to him for my feelings. He was truly sinister. It felt like my mind was stuck in a trap. I was scared of him even though he‚Äôd never raised his voice or called me names, but still, it felt impossible to leave.

The partner I met after that was sweet and emotionally available. He respected my boundaries and helped me to heal a lot from my relationship with my ex. He made me feel special and important and seen‚Ä¶until it came to conflict. If my feelings were hurt, he could only be sorry if the problem was because I was sensitive or triggered. Nothing was ever his fault. Our relationship was mostly good and I believe he loved me, but every now and then he would be triggered by my hurt feelings and blow up. It didn‚Äôt matter how gently or non-accusatory I brought up issues were. I‚Äôd seen how he could be unreasonable and reactive with others, so I wasn‚Äôt completely unaware. I just underestimated how cruel he could be when angry. He never called me names, but he was the king of DARVO. I broke up with him when he blew up at me for telling him my feelings were hurt by something he did, and he lost it. A week later we met to try and work through things and he was emotionally abusive in public‚Äîtelling me what I could and couldn‚Äôt say, didn‚Äôt let me shake my head, wouldn‚Äôt let me say the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù or use specific examples of things that happened during our breakup, things I had in writing that he was denying. I was so triggered by his contempt and aggression that I ran away from him and hid behind a garbage can in public at a coffee shop. It was painful and humiliating and heart breaking.

It was hard to accept that my most recent ex was abusive toward me, because we didn‚Äôt have an abusive relationship. I loved him. He loved me. He made me feel so safe and seen. He could hear my concerns most of the time. I don‚Äôt think he wanted to abuse me. At the coffee shop he seemed scared at how he was acting. It doesn‚Äôt erase or excuse what he did. Ultimately, it‚Äôs his choice to not acknowledge his behavior or get help. 

It‚Äôs so confusing to have these two experiences side by side. I hate my narcissist ex. I‚Äôm angry at my other ex, I no longer love him and would never take him back, but I don‚Äôt hate him. To an outsider, I feel like my most recent ex seems like more of an abuser based on his actions, but the truth is that my narcissistic ex was more manipulative and desired to hurt me. My most recent ex didn‚Äôt want to hurt me‚Ä¶It felt like he was trying to protect himself and unfortunately when he is triggered, emotional abuse is his defense mechanism.

I don‚Äôt know if this makes sense to anyone. I‚Äôm heartbroken that my most recent ex shattered my sense of safety with him. I‚Äôm shattered that once again, I cared for someone who ended up abusing me. But I‚Äôm also proud of myself that as soon as he engaged in abusive behaviors toward me, I ended the relationship, even though I still loved him.

It‚Äôs been over four months since we broke up and I am finally done wishing he would fix things. I‚Äôve accepted what happened and that we will never reconcile. He can‚Äôt fix this. 

What a mind fuck. I tell myself that I couldn‚Äôt have known. I didn‚Äôt miss anything with my most recent ex, like I did with my narc ex. I wasn‚Äôt duped or fooled. But still‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so sad for myself. I‚Äôm so sad that I attract abusers. I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôve had to learn these lessons. I‚Äôm a child of emotional neglect and abuse, but I‚Äôve healed a lot. I no longer need anyone‚Äôs validation to feel my worth. I hope that will help me to avoid falling for another person who will abuse me.

In the end, I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not the abuse was intentional with my most recent ex. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he truly loved me or if he was ‚Äúan abuser‚Äù. The fact is that he was emotionally abusive toward me and refused to change or repair and is not someone who can be a safe partner.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sharing this. I don‚Äôt know what I want from sharing my experience. I guess I am hoping that others out there might feel similarly. It‚Äôs such a lonely and isolating experience. I don‚Äôt think my friends understand how complicated it is. 

If you‚Äôve read all of this, thank you for hearing me. I guess that‚Äôs all I really needed.

Hey friends! üåü Ever feel like you just can‚Äôt quite keep up with that youthful vigor we all remember? I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to harness that endless energy of our 20s, right? A while back, I stumbled upon an energy hack that completely transformed my daily routine. And guess what? It‚Äôs perfect for us 50 and over! So grab your favorite cup of coffee (or tea, I don‚Äôt judge), and let‚Äôs chat about it.

First off, let‚Äôs face it‚Äîthose energy dips around 3 PM hit harder as we age. It‚Äôs like our bodies conspired against us. But here's the kicker: **who says we need to accept it?** There are ways to reclaim that pep in our step and stay focused without the dreaded jitters of coffee overdose.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Seriously, this one‚Äôs a game changer! Lack of hydration can zap your energy faster than a power outage. I keep a water bottle handy and aim for *at least* eight glasses a day. Your body will thank you!

- **Mind Your Munching:** Ever notice how some snacks give you a sugar rush followed by a crash? Instead, I‚Äôve switched to nuts, seeds, and whole grains. They‚Äôre like little energy powerhouses! Believe me, snacking smarter makes all the difference.

- **Get Moving:** I started incorporating short walks into my routine. Even just **10-15 minutes** can help boost my mood and energy. Plus, it's a perfect excuse to step away from the screen for a bit‚Äîwin-win!

- **Mindfulness Matters:** Practicing mindfulness or meditation for just a few minutes can clear the mental fog. I know, I know‚Äîsome folks think it's ‚Äúwoo-woo,‚Äù but honestly, sitting quietly and being present works wonders. 

- **Nourishing Nights:** Quality sleep really is the base of our energy pyramid. Trying to aim for a solid **7-8 hours** makes all the difference. I‚Äôve even established a chill evening routine‚Äîgoodbye, late-night screen time!

Oh, and before I forget, I recently came across a tool that ties all these energy hacks together pretty nicely. It‚Äôs right up our alley! **We believe in meaningful results.** Check it out here: [Mavely](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb). It‚Äôs fantastic for tracking habits and keeping you accountable in this energy journey!

Have you tried any of these hacks? What are your go-to tricks for feeling energized without the jitters? Let‚Äôs swap ideas and keep motivating each other! Remember, it‚Äôs all about finding what works best for you. Here‚Äôs to thriving, not just surviving! Cheers! üåº",1,1751856601.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

These specifications dictate how well the inverter converts DC power to AC power, as well as its ability to handle different types of loads and protect against potential hazards.**Continuous Power Rating:** This is the amount of power the inverter can provide continuously. A 2500-watt inverter should reliably supply 2500 watts of continuous power. It‚Äôs crucial to check if the manufacturer specifies the output under different input voltage conditions (e.g., 12V, 24V). If the inverter lacks sufficient continuous power, it could shut down unexpectedly, damaging connected tools and appliances.

**Peak Power Rating:** This indicates the maximum power the inverter can supply for a short period, typically during startup.A good 2500-watt inverter should have a peak power rating of at least twice its continuous rating (e.g.,5000 watts) to handle the surge of power required by many appliances,like refrigerators or power tools,when they first turn on. If the peak power rating is too low, larger appliances may not start correctly.

**Waveform Type:** Power inverters produce either a pure sine wave or a modified sine wave output. Pure sine wave inverters provide a cleaner, more stable power supply that is suitable for sensitive electronics, such as laptops, audio equipment, and certain medical devices. Modified sine wave inverters are more affordable but may not be compatible with all devices and can sometimes cause interference or reduce the lifespan of sensitive electronics.

**Efficiency:** The efficiency rating indicates how much of the DC power from the battery is converted into usable AC power.A high-efficiency inverter minimizes power loss and extends battery life. look for inverters with an efficiency rating of at least 85% or higher. This means more of the DC power will be used,and less of it will be lost as heat. Lower efficiency can lead to quicker battery drain and more heat generation.

**safety Features:** Essential safety features include overload protection, over-temperature protection, short-circuit protection, and reverse polarity protection. Overload protection safeguards the inverter from excessive power draw. Over-temperature protection prevents overheating which can damage the inverter and connected devices. Short-circuit protection prevents damage due to electrical shorts. Reverse polarity protection prevents damage if the battery is connected incorrectly. These features collectively ensure that the inverter and connected appliances are protected against common electrical issues.

**Cooling System:** A robust cooling system is crucial for preventing overheating,especially when running the inverter at high loads. Power inverters typically use fans or heat sinks (or a combination of both). consider models equipped with variable-speed fans that adjust their speed based on the inverter‚Äôs temperature to reduce noise and conserve energy. Overheating can cause the inverter to shut down and possibly damage the inverter itself.

## FAQs Section

**What size battery do I need for a 2500-watt inverter?**
To determine the appropriate battery size, calculate the current draw of the inverter at its maximum output (2500 watts). At 12V, this would be approximately 208 amps (2500W / 12V = 208.33A). Use a battery with sufficient amp-hour (Ah) capacity to handle this load for the desired duration. A deep-cycle battery is recommended for its ability to withstand repeated charge and discharge cycles.

**Can I run a refrigerator with a 2500-watt inverter?**
Yes, a 2500-watt inverter can run most refrigerators. Though, refrigerators require a high surge of power when starting (frequently enough 2-3 times their running wattage). Ensure that the inverter's peak power rating is high enough to handle this startup surge. Check the refrigerator‚Äôs power requirements, including both the running wattage and the startup wattage, to confirm compatibility.

**How long will a 2500-watt inverter run on a car battery?**
The runtime depends on the battery's capacity (measured in amp-hours) and the load being drawn. A typical car battery has a capacity of around 50-100 ah. To calculate the approximate runtime, divide the battery's capacity by the current draw of the inverter. For example, with a 100 Ah battery and a 200-amp draw, the runtime would be approximately 30 minutes (100 Ah / 200 A = 0.5 hours). Keep in mind that drawing a battery down completely can damage it,so it's best to use only 50-70% of its capacity.

**What are the main differences between a pure sine wave and a modified sine wave inverter?**
Pure sine wave inverters produce a power signal that closely resembles the waveform found in a household AC supply. This makes them suitable for sensitive electronics and devices with motors. Modified sine wave inverters produce a more ‚Äústepped‚Äù waveform and are less expensive but may not be compatible with all devices.Modified sine waves can cause some equipment to overheat or run inefficiently.

Act 1- Northside

Your reasons are known only to you, but somehow, you ended up walking the path of a mercenary.  Maybe, you were looking to escape from a bad home, maybe you need some extra eddies in your pocket, maybe you just like hurting people.  Whatever the case, you've got an uphill climb from here.  But hey, you've got a roof your head (for now at least), an iron on your hip, and a head full of dreams.  And if there's one thing Night City loves more than anything, it's dreams.  After all, a start as low as this will just make your legend all the greater, right?

Act 2- Japantown

Well, I'll be damned, you actually survived your first few jobs.  You found a low-level fixer desperate enough to give you a job, and then a couple more, and next thing you know, you've gone from making small-talk with the roaches on the walls to actually needing an elevator to get to your apartment.  As your brand new cyber-eyes take in the view of the streets below, your fixer calls you in for another job.  Things are actually going pretty well.  But you know that you've still got a long way to go.

Act 3- The Glen

You made it.  By god, you made it.  You've hit the big leagues now.  You've taken on the toughest gigs, chipped yourself to hell and back, and maybe even murdered an innocent or two along the way (honestly, it's hard to keep track these days).  You've probably got enough eddies hoarded in some offshore account to buy yourself a cozy villa in North Oak, but you and I both know that you could never leave this life behind.  So, as you sip your freshly brewed coffee while sitting on your real leather couch, you decide to ring up Rogue to see if she's got anything to help you kill time.  To your utter lack of surprise, she says she's got a few things that could be up your alley.  As you ring the valet to bring your Rayfield to the door, you wonder how you ever survived like this before.  Now if only that chick behind the bar would put your drink on the menu...

Act 4- Corpo Plaza

It all started with one job.  Then, you proved yourself useful.  More jobs started coming your way from higher up the ladder, and before you knew it, you were signing a contract as an ""independent contractor"".  The suits take good care of you: a luxurious apartment in the plaza, top-shelf implants, military-grade weapons, the whole kit and caboodle.  All they ask in return is that you solve their problems for them, and don't become a problem yourself.  Sounds like as good a deal as ever was.  As you finish off your 3rd glass of imported Brazilian wine, a thought pops into your head: Was this all worth it?  What did it cost to get here?  Fortunately, your implants detect these preposterous thoughts and immediately bury them under a healthy dosage of serotonin and dopamine.  Maybe you'll swing by the Afterlife later on and...

Well they too are ramping up a new location and it's going to be on the NW corner of Country Club & Southern (possibly in the old 99¬¢ store space) Shamrock is open to the public and is way smaller, but they have good stuff there.  If you like coffee syrup, there's lots of  options there and you can buy giant containers of Thrifty/Shamrock ice cream and other restaurant size containers of food products.  I get my Cambro storage containers there.  The new Shamrock should be open in the October/November time frame I'm told.  It's nice to see new locations in the East valley.

Then Dawna hops on to‚Ä¶ make homemade creamer? While babbling nonsense? And ends the video grinning over her coffee like she‚Äôs in a Hallmark ad. Meanwhile, the community is underwater.

It‚Äôs absolutely infuriating watching these two profit off of tragedy while doing nothing to help. If you‚Äôre not going to raise money, spread real info, or actually show up, don‚Äôt pretend like you care. They‚Äôre not comforting anyone, they‚Äôre cashing in.

While she was a student I completely understood. However, this as persisted as she has taken on a very high paying lucrative career. She makes \~$600k annually, and has no debt or family that she's supporting. She has no financial trauma that we know of, she grew up in an average middle class family.

  
When we go out for meals, if there is any discrepancy in cost she will ask to split exactly based off what we ordered (even if I ordered something $2 more expensive). We never gift each other anything, whereas with other friends it's very much I'll grab a coffee here, or cover the tab today. It's noticeable even when she orders off the menu - I'll see her going for the cheapest item.  


I make significantly less than her, but enough that I'm not worried about a dollar here or there - I truly believe it will all even out over time/ I'm not that concerned if it doesn't either.. She is extremely consistent - she always makes sure we're not covering for her more expensive orders either. I don't feel at all ripped-off by her, but I do find the whole calculating to the penny to be pretty annoying, and honestly confusing. I feel like I have no right to be annoyed by this, but I do find myself getting frustrated - it just seems petty and somewhat transactional. I thought it would decrease over time as she has increased her income, but we've seen it go the other way - now she's gotten more concerned about cash back/rewards. Beyond my annoyance, I am somewhat concerned about her - I can tell she's stressed about money, and she's in a position where she doesn't need to be. I am very confident that there's nothing more going on that she would need this money for.
